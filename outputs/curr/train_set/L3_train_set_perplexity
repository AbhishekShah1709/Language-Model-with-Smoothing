Although there are a few isolated reports in the literature suggesting that sugar beet pollen is highly antigenic, hypersensitivity to components of sugar beet is not a common disease.	1.021906836915816
We report a 29-year-old man with a history of atopic dermatitis who developed both contact dermatitis and allergic rhinitis from sugar beet pollen through his job in a seed nursery.	0.9926763074195344
Establishing nursing science at German universities has become more and more consolidated.	0.794124171660848
At the beginning of this establishment there was an evident backlog especially compared to angloamerican and scandinavian countries.	0.9645998136793302
Today - 1997 - more than 40 nursing science courses exist at German high schools and universities.	1.0885812318083083
Active glucocorticoids (GCS), such as cortisol or corticosterone, are a prerequisite for the induction of surfactant synthesis in the fetal lung.	1.1383091950680606
In fetal serum, biologically inactive metabolites (cortisone or 11-dehydrocorticosterone) outweigh the active forms.	0.7905090341558716
In this study we demonstrate with organoid cultures of fetal rat lungs that the reductive side of 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11-HSD) regulates the intracellular activation of GCS.	1.0739667199329017
The inhibition of 11-HSD by the licorice extract glycyrrhetinic acid completely inhibits this central metabolism.	0.7480956390805176
On the other hand, GCS induce the reductive activity of 11-HSD and, therefore, they increase their own activation by positive feedback.	1.054365586865226
In a community sample of 394 eldery aged 61 years and older from East and West Germany, diseases, contacts with general practitioners and specialists, the use of medicine, attitudes regarding health and illness, the subjective health, psychic problems, social support, social integration, social burden, and socio-demographic variables were assessed.	1.1267777758377409
Based on these data the determinants for the contact of physicians and the use of medicine were analyzed.	0.8653939850027131
The results confirmed the frequency of multimorbidity in the elderly; on average we found three different diseases at the same time for each person.	1.227895255062817
In nearly 10% of the sample we found seven diagnoses existing at the same time.	1.059138802670993
88% had contact with a general practitioner at least once a year, 97% had contact either with a general practitioner or with a specialist once a year.	1.1191934888000064
55.8% took at least one medicine each day.	0.9311297018401176
The number of diseases existing at the same time was the most determining variable for the contact of physicians and the use of medicine.	0.9568966219912705
Furthermore, the elderly had more contact with physicians and took more medicine if they thought they were susceptible to diseases in a high degree, and if they rated their own health as poor.	1.205059738860569
Fewer contacts with physicians and a lower use of medicine were found in those elderly that rated health behavior as little useful, that had low control beliefs regarding their own health, and that experienced only a low degree of health-related limitations in their everyday life.	1.1686309079966355
Furthermore, we found a higher use of medicine if there was little social support.	1.3420237078794786
There were no significant age-related or sex-related differences regarding the contact of practitioners or the use of medicine.	1.1514928551165124
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD: Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) are chronic inflammatory and frequently relapsing diseases of the gut that ultimately lead to destruction of the intestinal tissue.	0.9378400865782028
Recent evidence suggests that a pathologic activation of the mucosal immune system in response to antigens is a key factor in the pathogenesis of IBD.	1.0035851308729955
Furthermore, changes in cell migration and cytokine production appear to contribute to the perpetuation of IBD and the postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease.	1.0643244852942144
Based on recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD, several new therapeutic strategies are currently being tested in clinical practice, including recombinant anti-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-, IL-10, IL-11) and inhibitors of cell adhesion molecules (ICAM), proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-12) and their receptors (TNF, IL-6R).	1.2351545203886305
Dysregulation of apoptosis may play a major role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).	0.6408157523441134
A defective clearance of apoptotic cells or inappropriately high rates of apoptosis may lead to a pathologic accumulation of abnormal cell material with a secondary autoimmune response.	0.89693678133606
Experimental findings in apoptotic keratinocytes and C1q knock-out mice suggest an important role of C1q in the clearance of apoptotic cell material.	0.9878832696162735
In addition, there are several links between C1q and SLE: Most the patients with C1q deficiency develop a SLE-like syndrome.	1.1676740783749695
SLE itself often causes secondary C1q deficiency and autoantibodies to C1q are detected in almost all patients with active lupus nephritis.	0.9809749904288079
These observations suggest a central role of C1q in apoptosis and in the pathogenesis of SLE.	1.0733470904012208
Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the causes and accident mechanisms that lead to injuries in infancy involving buggies and prams in order to establish strategies for accident prevention.	0.9463884554433056
The discussion about the implementation of telemedicine and teleresourcing and its consequences has been under way for some time now.	0.8999858059635519
The rate at which telemedical applications are being developed, leaves little time for consideration of the economic, scientific and social aspects.	1.015982129761155
There is a need for integration of all the existing fragments into one coherent telemedical concept.	0.919268708839621
Different aspects of telemedical concepts are discussed.	0.47405946427277923
A 34-year-old woman who was separated from her husband, was killed by him by strangulation and several stab wounds in the chest.	0.9480169203773556
The post-mortem examination was carried out approximately 5 h after death.	0.8289396521583768
At the place of discovery one swab of her right and one of her left neck side were taken.	0.8831684230552395
Additionally, a swab was taken out from the front side of the collar of her polo-neck pullover.	1.0852721183805125
It was obvious that the skin of the neck below the larynx showed a fabric pattern leading to the assumption that the collar was temporarily pressed between the hands of the suspect and the neck of the victim.	1.048600823576643
DNA typing (short tandem repeat-PCR) of these swabs led to the detection of mixed patterns for the swabs of the neck and the collar which matched the patterns of the victim and the suspect.	1.1606900948303025
A prospective randomized clinical trial was performed to evaluate the use of self-reinforced absorbable composites (Biofix) in the fixation of ankle fractures.	1.2723327333725203
The aim of this study was to demonstrate that fixation with Biofix rods and screws is as good as the standard A. O. fixation.	1.097110893105928
The benefits of Biofix rods and screws are: a reduction in costs since no secondary operation is needed, prevention of stress-shielding and thereby diminishing the risk of bone porosity.	1.079484892536839
Patients aged between 16 and 75 years old with closed, non-comminuted fractures of the lateral and/or medial malleolus and dislocation of the fracture fragments greater thean 2 mm were included in the study.	1.072020060065903
22 patients were treated with Biofix rods and screws and the control group of 19 patients with a standard technique.	1.276069191279222
After 3, 6 and 12 months, rontgenograms were taken.	0.9546249917219795
At the same time functional results were evaluated following the criteria of Olerud and Molander.	1.1193883659523136
Two patients were withdrawn from the trial for non-medical reasons.	0.9216399493510204
22 patients (12 from the Biofix group, 10 from the AO group) operated two or more years ago were contacted to see if any complications had occured since they were last seen.	1.0496143713196895
In 4 cases a Biofix screw broke down just beneath the head during insertion.	0.8080796127164535
This did not result in an insufficient fixation of the fracture.	1.0493985640082049
There were no early post-operative complications.	1.0317729173054582
The functional and rontgenological results in both groups were equal.	1.1036274257988532
In three cases a sterile sinus developed at the site of screw insertion.	0.9255086570898611
Biofix rods and screws, made of polylactic acid, are a good alternative for the fixation of fractures of the ankle.	1.1820672066210596
The use of resorbable fracture fixation material has the advantage that a second operation to remove osteosynthesis material is not necessary.	1.0324205347470061
The long term results are good.	1.0613789017118131
There is, however, a possibility of development of tissue reaction to the resorbable material.	1.0740827575308693
In current textbooks of dermatology, lichen amyloidosus is said to be a papular, intensely pruritic type of amyloidosis of unknown aetiology.	0.9293425118930172
When this concept was developed, there was no way of discriminating between the different types of amyloid.	1.0176025040105035
It is now known that amyloid in lichen amyloidosus is not derived from immunoglobulins or serum proteins, as it is in systemic amyloidoses, but from keratin peptides of necrotic keratinocytes.	1.0937281110904293
Even several years ago, chronic scratching was invoked as a possible cause of damage to keratinocytes in lichen amyloidosus.	0.9133481974366077
In support of this hypothesis, four cases are presented.	0.9706897697659373
Apart from amyloid in the papillary layer, all biopsy specimens revealed histopathological signs of chronic scratching (epithelial hyperplasia with hypergranulosis and compact orthokeratosis, coarse collagen in vertical streaks in the stratum papillare), such as are also found in prurigo nodularis and lichen simplex chronicus.	1.006316882342275
Lichen amyloidosus is considered to be a variant of these conditions.	0.9795394811904096
Just as in prurigo nodularis and lichen simplex chronicus, pruritus seems to be the cause and not a symptom of the papular skin lesions.	1.0444008688458812
Consequently, treatment of lichen amyloidosus should not be directed at removing amyloid, but at improving the pruritus.	1.2039276965919454
Ulcers in chronic venous insufficiency, especially in postthrombotic syndrome, are often resistant to compression therapy.	1.1138761342374228
They can be treated effectively by the dermatologic surgeon with a fairly simple operative procedure.	0.9289733129514366
The removal of the ulcer together with the extensive lipodermatosclerosis by Humby knife (shave-therapy) and immediate grafting with a meshed split skin graft - possibly in combination with ligation of insufficient perforator veins - yields very good success rates.	1.0220100561201089
The results in 13 patients (18 legs) with an average follow up period of 11 months (up to 20 months) are reported.	1.5686200713727525
The literature from 1990-1997 and 3 personal cases are reviewed to give an update on findings and current therapy for adder bites.	0.9596131477713746
Bites of the adder (Vipera berus) are rare.	0.8661578404482291
Symptomatic treatment usually leads to complete restitution, death due to adder bite is rare.	0.7405116127270156
The main venom effect is the development of - sometimes severe - edema, hemolysis and disseminated coagulopathy, very occasionally followed by lethal renal failure.	1.1292644982869129
Significant intoxication is very unlikely if 2-3 h after the incident, no signs of intoxication can be found.	1.1090042903035047
Background: The use of high-tech communication is undoubtedly growing and has become established in almost all sciences and research fields.	0.9586757482445404
This article surveys the possibilities for scientific data-exchange via the Internet, the world's largest computer network.	1.0343406753366604
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are known to exhibit far less cardiac side effects than tricyclic antidepressants.	0.9428349486043051
We report three cases in which the SSRI, paroxetine, induced clinically relevant ECG changes in patients with high risk profile.	1.0670093003941448
In two cases an increase in QTc time was observed, severe bradycardia was also observed twice.	1.1097115073172878
Objective: Cultural detection of Bordetella pertussis is not very helpful in the management of patients with whooping cough, since culture takes three to five days until results are available, and only about 30-60% of patients may be detected by this method.	1.2134940950609423
In order to improve the laboratory diagnosis of whooping cough, different protocols for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were developed.	1.00013345947381
With the introduction of each new technique for registering eye movements, the question arises concerning whether these provide a reliable and accurate alternative for the  diagnosis of labyrinthine dysfunction when compared to the most commonly used electro-oculographic technique.	1.0893268268750673
To answer this question we compared mean slow-phase velocity (SPV) using three different recording techniques: electro-oculography (EOG), video-oculography (VOG) and infra-red oculography (IROG) during four different types of examinations.	1.0268976587167256
The examinations were the eye target tracking test (ETT), horizontal and vertical optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) tests and the rotating chair test of the horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex (HVOR).	0.9832930441236385
For the ETT tests the VOG provided consistently higher mean SPV values with low variance, presumably because of the accuracy and stability of the calibration.	0.9715123920956382
For the horizontal OKN and VOR rotating chair tests no significant differences were found between the mean SPV obtained with the different recording techniques, although the IROG recordings were associated with a larger variance.	1.059851906483687
Vertical OKN mean SPV was consistently lower with IROG and VOG techniques presumably because of non-linearities and resolution limitations inherent in these techniques.	0.8045109125535822
These results indicate that the EOG technique despite its disadvantages of noise, time to apply and variability of calibration still provides an inexpensive, reliable and accurate means of measuring slow-phase eye movements.	0.9714152902482655
Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the plasma levels of the circulating adhesion molecules sICAM-1 and sE-selectin could serve as early predictors of developing sepsis and its severity.	1.0324905379337423
Problem: The data model given in the  DICOM standard is examined unter the aspect of system integration.	1.1297528385415716
Semantic properties of the IODs (information object definitions) and their relationships are investigated.	1.105464433778169
Thoracic disc herniation is rare.	0.5137220876589833
Pain is the most common initial symptom, followed by sensory disturbances and motor involvement.	1.1609047358207754
By the time of diagnosis, 90% of the patient have signs of spinal cord compression.	1.3304788019447
A 42-year-old woman was operated on because of shoulder pain.	0.9883866973538045
During her stay in hospital, the patient first demonstrated uncharacteristic pain and after 2weeks an incomplete paraplegia caused by herniation of the T10/11 disc.	1.012918731031533
Degenerative changes have been considered to be a cause for spontaneous quadriceps tendon rupture.	1.0299815195316928
Aim of this study is to investigate the microvasculature of the quadriceps tendon by injection techniques and immunohistochemical methods (antibodies against laminin) with regard to the pathogenesis of tendon degeneration.	1.127336314083747
The blood supply of the quadriceps tendon arises from descending branches of the lateral circumflex femoral artery, by branches of the descending geniculate artery and by branches of the medial and lateral superior geniculate arteries.	1.036824837742304
Blood vessels penetrate the tendon from the surrounding connective tissue and anastomose with a longitudinally orientated intraligamentous network.	0.7004883855125117
Compared to the surrounding synovial layer, the amount of vessels in the tendon substance is greatly reduced.	0.9661540207803764
The distribution of blood vessels within the quadriceps tendon is not homogenous.	0.8021721591188192
The anterior or superficial part of the tendon has a complete vascular network that extends from the musculo-tendinous junction to the patella.	0.9689216432105529
Within the deep portion of the quadriceps tendon there is an oval shaped avascular area which measures app.	0.8692292064354512
30 mm in length and app.	0.7158012577169837
Within this area the immunohistochemical proof of laminin is negative.	0.7583479841691915
An explanation for the absence of blood vessels may be compressive stress caused by the patellar groove which serves as hypomochlion for the quadriceps tendon when the knee is flexed.	0.8763086280750525
The occurrence of an avascular zone within the deep layer of the tendon that is directed to the joint cavity may explain the frequency of degenerative changes in this region.	1.0292722257024682
When looking for the possible cause of distortions in values measured for the determination of breath ethanol concentration (BEC) in artificially respirated patients, consideration must be given to the humidity and temperature of the gas examined.	1.0186709648236414
In the present study, the effects of humidified and warmed and of dry and cold air on the accuracy of a newly developed BEC measuring device, as compared to a reference model and to a conventional system, were examined in a lung model.	1.161272688846571
Total or partial relapses after conventional surgical advancement of the maxilla following Le Fort I osteotomy in CLP patients are frequent and major complications.	0.9569896238100881
The aim of this investigation was to find out whether the technique of distraction osteogenesis in these patients shows more stability and whether maxillary distraction is able to replace conventional advancement.	1.04262404099742
Maxillary distraction was performed in 12 patients.	0.9611768638406513
In two cases, a Delaire mask was used to bring the maxilla forward, ten patients were treated with the extraoral distraction device designed by Polley.	1.0456904975894223
In all patients, planned advancement of the maxilla could be achieved; one partial relapse occurred.	0.9827549792105985
The results indicate that distraction osteogenesis offers the possibility of advancement of the maxilla with the required stability.	0.9196040527206764
The technique presents a major improvement which is achieved with a relatively minor surgical procedure.	0.9689384402561476
We report a rare case of primary primitive neuroectodermal tumour of the bladder in an adult.	1.0270986504495243
A huge tumour with extensions into pelvic and retroperitoneal tissue was found radiologically in a 62-year-old man.	0.8447592496532692
The patient did not complain about remarkable clinical symptoms until 4 days before admission to hospital.	0.7607863288758264
Histology of diagnostic transurethral tumour resection showed a small round-cell tumour with focal necrosis and scattered Homer-Wright rosettes.	0.8587011433362385
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that tumour cells stained positively with O13, a monoclonal antibody which recognizes the membrane glycoprotein p30/32MIC2.	0.8943103067180945
Focally, tumour cells stained positively for vimentin, NSE, S-100 protein and synaptophysin.	0.8502258354503944
The patient died 3 weeks later because of fulminant pulmonary embolism and autopsy revealed a huge, partly exophytic but mainly endophytic tumour of the bladder with extensions into the rectum and retroperitoneal tissue.	1.06190482546895
The differential diagnosis of small round-cell tumours in this location is discussed.	1.0061415953426978
Lesions of the acetabular labrum should be treated by correcting the causes.	1.0856501699316863
In a steep acetabulum where the femoral head brings the acetabular labrum under tension and traction, the acetabulum should be rotated by triple pelvic osteotomy to slightly overcorrected acetabular measurements.	0.9716789191435913
Severely diminished acetabular and femoral anteversion can also lead to tears and impingement of the labrum.	0.8478454519154025
Then rotation of the femoral neck and/or rotations of the acetabulum by triple osteotomy to 15-20  ° of anteversion are indicated.	1.0913327858541748
Our triple osteotomy technique differs from that of others mainly in the ischial osteotomy.	0.7847186831499314
It is performed from the posterior approach between the sciatic notch next to the ischial spine and the obturator foramen and is directed 20-30  ° anteriorly from the frontal (coronal) plane.	1.0109496756462688
The osteotomies therefore are placed close enough to the acetabulum to allow free rotation, but they do not interfere with the circulation of the acetabulum, and the ligaments between the sacrum and ischium are left in normal tension.	1.1359275479700013
Our normal values of the acetabular position were tested by correlating the measurements with the absence of pain.	1.0209704798900987
The optimum is reached with a CE angle and a VCA angle of 30-35  °, an angle of the weight-bearing zone of +5 to -5  ° and a migration index of 10-15 %.	1.15301006001774
Overcorrections again caused pain and should be avoided.	0.5236561433108954
Diminished anteversion of femur and acetabulum towards 0  ° also caused pain and should be corrected by triple and femoral osteotomy to 15-20  ° of anteversion.	0.8926802089240967
In earlier follow-ups of 216 hips 5-10 years postoperatively, 82.3 % of the joints showed no change in the degree of osteoarthrosis.	1.1968708396472534
Survival rate curves regarding the absence of pain demonstrated that pain was experienced again when joints were corrected insufficiently or overcorrected, while in good corrections the joints were free of pain in about 75 %.	1.0559939698134921
Background: Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy is associated with point mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that appear to be pathogenic for this disease.	1.104954018662593
These mutations affect nucleotide positions 3460, 11 778 and 14 484.	0.8568081030364979
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II (HIT type II) is an immunoglobulin-mediated, drug-induced side effect for heparin-treated patients with thromboembolic complications.	1.200643664452964
With an incidence of 1-3 %, mortality of 20 % it and permanent disability for another 20 % is a clinically relevant disorder.	1.3840759697315814
With heparin treatment or prophylaxis frequent platelet count monitoring is necessary.	0.7300280350264837
With HIT type II the thrombocytopenia is often a harbinger of thromboembolic complications in the venous or arterial system.	0.881669630427972
If HIT type II is suspected, further heparin exposure is to be stopped immediately and another anticoagulant therapy should be started.	1.0660150052187651
The two anticoagulant options in Germany are discussed.	0.865220644640389
At the same time the diagnosis should be confirmed by laboratory testing, including testing for cross-reactivity with danaparoid.	1.1449548208260576
Further therapy depends on the symptoms.	0.5052951385814961
In the case of clinical relevance of this disorder we should think about prophylaxis: strict indications for perioperative prophylaxis only use of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for routine prophylaxis, use of LMWH for thrombosis treatment and early change to cumarine.	1.0985395193873102
A patented low-temperature polymerization method for methylmethacrylate (MMA) infiltrated bone marrow biopsies is described: it has been developed from our previous MMA technique and is a patented procedure.	1.0807143352598558
Differences from the previous method are (1) removal of stabilizer from the MMA monomer before its application, (2) the use of a different starter, (3) avoidance of O2 influence during polymerization by means of vacuum exchange with N2, and (4) polymerisation in a water bath to draw off residual heat.	1.0575858711224089
After this procedure, all immunohistochemical reactions are possible provided that the previous fixation is adequate.	0.9943402821053859
The effects of different fixatives are reviewed briefly without detailed analysis.	0.7951434845781579
Technically, this plastic embedding can be performed at least as rapidly as the classic paraffin embedding after decalcification.	1.1756081455616025
The advantages over the latter method are: (1) the cells can be better differentiated because semi-thin sections can be made; (2) the immunoreactions can also be performed on the basis of semi-thin sections, which means they can be interpreted more easily; (3) morphometric analyses yield more reliable results because of the constant thickness of sections; (4) osteological examination of bone trabeculae, especially the search for mineralisation deficiencies, is possible; (5) the plastic embedding procedure is less dependent on individual instabilities in the quality of performance of the staff members involved.	1.2141625056812306
Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that the costs for additional equipment necessary remain below DM 100,000 including an excellent microtome.	1.0923444842244543
The routine use of succinylcholine for endotracheal intubation is being increasingly questioned.	0.8617878805420148
Initial studies have suggested that a combination of propofol and alfentanil without a muscle relaxant can provide good intubating conditions.	0.9239867648647605
However, most of these initial studies either did not have a double-blind design or did not include a control group with muscle relaxants.	1.2810475674750539
In this study, intubation conditions using fentanyl/propofol without a muscle relaxant were compared with the combinations of fentanyl/propofol/succinylcholine and sodium thiopental/succinylcholine.	0.9591290342429518
Nosocomial pneumonia is still a common problem, especially in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients.	1.2164545618922595
The endotracheal tube contributes substantially to the pathogenesis of pneumonia in these patients, because it facilitates microaspiration and impairs host defense.	0.9723276201073999
Common nosocomial pathogens like Pseudomonas aeruginosa are known to produce exopolysaccharides and generate a complex biofilm structure, which allows adhesion to abiotic surfaces and protection against antibiotic action.	0.9558290738945362
Multiple studies have identified bacterial biofilm on the inner lumen of endotracheal tubes, which represents a permanent source of infectious material.	1.0172912860358136
Endotracheal tubes, removed from patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia, are covered more frequently with biofilm than those of uninfected controls.	0.9338474869260636
It remains unclear whether this represents a source of infection or contamination.	0.8998711288953094
Bacterial biofilm, however, may play an important role in recurrent pulmonary infections of the intubated and mechanically ventilated patient.	1.0211633382157206
Computer-guided robot-assisted surgery in cementless total hip replacement requires exact preoperative planning at the 3D workstation Orthodoc.	0.9528799870226824
Only the Robodoc procedure allows the precise execution of the preoperative plan in surgery.	0.967238876049623
Robot-assisted surgery has been undergoing clinical evaluation at the Berufsgenossenschaftliche Unfallklinik, Frankfurt, since November 1994.	0.9908051336250998
In all 465 patients, the preoperative plan was successfully carried out intraoperatively.	1.0384373860577032
The high precision in reaming, leading to a superb bone implant contact, guarentees absolute initial stability and is likely to promote primary healing between implant and bone.	0.8819909655021643
The common and often published incidence of varus or valgus malpositioning and any fractures or fissures could be avoided through the use of Robodoc.	0.8997602173770112
Although immediate full-weight bearing was strongly recommended to the patients, no implant subsidence was seen in the regular follow-up X ray studies.	1.1352959564192673
In this study we describe 22 cases of retrograde ureteral stent placement in pregnant women with therapy-resistant flank pain due to hydronephrosis.	1.0355809216797298
Eleven were primiparous and one patient expected twins.	0.7739485476369683
Eight of 22 patients presented symptoms of pyelonephritis.	0.7365712386206569
In 21 cases the hydronephrosis was located on the right and in 4 cases it was bilateral.	1.2222962601670242
Maximal lower calix diameter was 12 mm (range 9-22 mm).	0.9320710470149901
With the exception of two cases, sonographically controlled stent placement was performed under local anesthesia without sedation.	0.8924573379513608
All patients were painfree within 6 days and were given prophylactic low dosis of antibiotic until the day of delivery.	1.0681504605113383
Renal function remained within the normal limits.	0.6663179960130079
Double-J stent displacement occured in 3 patients - of which one underwent nephrostomy.	1.1240761895744606
Postnatal examination demonstrated urolithiasis in 4 of 19 patients.	0.8366695678064415
This study provides evidence for effectiveness of retrograde ureteral Double-J stent placement as a therapeutic option in cases of severe symptomatic hydronephrosis during pregnancy with a low morbidity rate.	1.090880351037662
Between 1981 and 1994 at the Bergmannsheil Ruhr University Hospital in Bochum, Germany, we treated 145 patients with femoral diaphyseal nonunions following initial operative treatment.	0.9301501504618828
Of these patients, 138 received this initial operative treatment at an outside institution.	0.8393660297714799
The primary reconstructions for the fractures utilized plates in 112 cases, reamed nails in 24 cases and external fixators in 9 cases.	0.9204166392328625
The average age of the patients was 35 years and the mean time from the initial operative treatment was 2 years.	1.3969961539759224
Twenty-seven patients (19 %) presented with a hypertrophic nonunion and 118 (81 %) with an atrophic nonunion.	1.2289562562810814
There was a significant correlation between primary "classic" plating and development of an atrophic nonunion (2-test: P < 0.01).	1.0173993131065362
We observed 34 wound infections (23 %) with no significant correlation to the type of primary osteosynthesis.	1.166315332176609
We determined that 73 of the pseudarthroses were due to improper osteosynthesis techniques.	0.6708685898514668
Of these cases, 41 % involved the use of plates, 83 % involved the use of reamed nails, and 78 % involved the use of external fixators.	1.1194224430851845
Fracture location near the diaphyseal-metaphyseal junctions was common in this problematic group.	0.7528943210783644
Ninety-two percent of all plates led to atrophic nonunions.	0.8057275729442473
There were 21 open fractures and of these 90 % (n = 19) developed an atrophic pseudarthrosis and 29 % (n = 6) developed a wound infection.	1.2409392555384915
Fifty-seven (39 %) of all patients had additional injuries, but we found that did not increase the risk of disturbed bone healing.	1.2394445635349194
Our revision operations focused on the elimination of wound infections, refreshment of bone healing, and improvement in fragment stability.	0.955318415165051
Only 28 % of all "classic" plates and 11 % of all external fixators were changed to an intramedullary implant at the time of the first revision surgery.	1.275563598512355
Hypertrophic nonunions required a mean of 1.3 revision operations to achieve bone healing whereas a mean of 2 revision operations were necessary to fuse atrophic bone ends (P < 0.05).	0.9723722507765129
In cases of diaphyseal pseudarthrosis healing time was not affected by the type of osteosynthesis used for primary reconstructions.	0.8986635300374664
Since lack of fracture healing can often already be observed directly from postoperative X-rays, we recommend that revision procedures be performed early.	1.1022125460291379
The prolonged length of time to care for femoral nonunions underlines the importance of appropriate primary fracture treatment.	0.8592196055754183
That takes into consideration both the biomechanical and the biological aspects of bone healing.	0.9019756253539302
Background: In a prospective trial (October 1996 - April 1998) the effect of octreotide and tamoxifen on the recurrence of pancreatic carcinoma after R0 resection was evaluated.	1.2057506756159944
Methods: Patients with a local recurrence after curative resection of ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were treated with 100 µg of octreotide three times a day and tamoxifen 20 mg once daily.	1.2326864240112168
The median survival time, quality of life (EORTC-QLQ-30) and side effects of the octreotide-tamoxifen group were compared with a historic cohort (n = 14) of patients treated in our department (9/95-9/96) according to the "best supportive care" concept.	1.1733710930368697
Results: Recurrences were diagnosed after R0 resection in a mean time of 13  +/-  6.8 months.	1.171248190874021
Patients treated with octreotide and tamoxifen had a significantly (P < 0.05) longer median survival time (7 months; range: 3-12) vs 3.5 months; range: 1.5-5).	1.1084581822856097
The octreotide-tamoxifen group suffered less from lack of appetite, nausea, fatigue, and pain and needed fewer analgesies.	1.0495609247250264
The only side effect of the octreotide-tamoxifen therapy was moderate diarrhoe in 2 patients at the beginning of the therapy.	1.009377891457549
Conclusion: Since combined therapy with octreotide and tamoxifen can be administered comfortably for outpatient treatment, this seems to represent progress in the palliative therapy of pancreatic cancer.	1.23539903703147
Objective: To study the influence of dopexamine on pulmonary shunt and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction during major thoracic surgery with one-lung ventilation (OLV).	0.8584782370216538
Design: Prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled study.	0.994634576020258
Patients: Twenty adult patients undergoing elective pulmonary resection.	0.8310136474699944
Anaesthesia: General anaesthesia was performed using propofol, fentanyl, N2O and vecuronium.Volume-controlled ventilation was performed to maintain normocapnia over the whole investigation period.	1.0411871412581832
During OLV, the tidal volume was reduced and the respiratory rate was increased to avoid a peak airway pressure exceeding 40 cm H2O.	1.034565019169259
Furthermore the FiO2 was increased to 1,0 and the external PEEP was removed during OLV.	1.1111070923571342
Interventions: The patients received either dopexamine at 2 µg/kg/min (group A, n=10) or 0,9% saline as control (group B, n=10) after assessing the baseline values.	1.2737471112886225
Measurement and results: The following cardiorespiratory variables were recorded: Heart rate, mean arterial pressure and mean pulmonary arterial pressure.	1.0798811005602298
Cardiac output was measured by thermodilution using a continuous cardiac output thermodilution catheter.	0.8780936816618384
Arterial and mixed venous blood gas analysis were measured from simultaneously drawn samples.	0.9255106873565785
Cardiac index (CI), systemic vascular resistance index, pulmonary vascular resistance index, oxygen delivery index (DO2I), oxygen consumption index and the venous admixture were calculated using standard formula.	1.190215619056721
Furthermore, pressure-flow-curves were constructed to analyse flow independent changes in the pulmonary vascular resistance.	1.1262335833778483
Data were recorded at the following times: After induction of anaesthesia in stable haemodynamics during two-lung ventilation (baseline values, T0), intraoperatively during one-lung ventilation (T1) and postoperatively after re-establishing two-lung ventilation (T2).	0.8993563667744875
Patients characteristics, data from the preoperative lung function testing and surgical procedures did not differ significantly between the groups.	1.161219349151992
CI increased in the dopexamine group from 2,5 +/- 1,2 l - min-1 - m-2 (T0) to 3,6 +/- 0,9 l - min-1 - m-2 (T1) and 4,0 +/- 1,3 l - min-1 -  m-2 (T2).	1.1361445623599569
The course of the intrapulmonary right-to-left shunting did not differ between the groups.	0.9276495407227282
In the dopexamine-treated group the DO2I increased from 430 +/- 143 ml - min - m-2 (T0) to 652 +/- 255 ml - min - m-2 (T1) and 653 +/- 207 ml - min - m-2 (T2).	0.905962886721109
Regarding the pressure-flow-curves there was no difference during OLV between the two groups indicating no major blocking effect of dopexamine on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.	1.028681371398771
Conclusion: It is concluded that dopexamine can be used to improve haemodynamics and oxygen delivery during thoracic surgery without increasing venous admixture during one-lung ventilation.	1.1879675652011765
Functional cine MRI of the pelvic floor is a yet another modality in addition to various radiological fluoroscopic techniques.	1.0676955977570814

Background: The influence of cyanosis, and cardiac index in children with cyanotic heart disease on their growth velocity.	1.1620110277285922
Regular examinations of prostitutes may reduce the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases in this high risk group.	0.9102463703639424
Therefore since April 1988 regular mandatory examinations have been offered by the regional health office in cooperation with the Department of Dermatology of the Ruhr-University of Bochum.	0.9584483506814708
The aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptance and efficiency of such an examination.	0.8019564389748277
The study was based on anonymous questionnaires.	1.0046238749054688
Mean age of the 80 prostitutes was 31.4; 67 of then were born in Germany.	0.9666836417367156
78 of the women always used condoms, while 71 thought that condoms prevent STDs.	1.0204679614784666
Three women suffered from a STD in the last 12 months.	1.0463918449021385
The majority the women (75 from this 80 prostitutes) did not perceive the examination as discrimination, while 71 felt the examinations were of high quality.	1.103420688524765
These results indicate that regular mandatory examinations should be part of health prevention care of prostitutes and that they are well accepted and tolerated by these women.	0.9386477149783697
Atrial fibrillation and related arrhythmias are common after cardiac surgery.	0.8760974291580766
As more and more elderly patients are operated on for cardiac diseases, the interest in this arrhythmia is growing again.	1.0664720019790628
There are some unresolved problems of this complication.	0.8551706388715701
Reevaluation of atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery by review of recent literature.	1.0108355318643103
Usually postsurgical atrial fibrillation is transient, self-limiting, and benign.	1.0669240759886516
Nevertheless, among patients affected by this arrhythmia, morbidity, mortality and costs by hospital stay are higher than without this complication.	1.1361771722143357
In addition, postsurgical atrial fibrillation can increase morbidity and mortality by itself.	1.1367584526934726
Today, general recommendations for prevention of atrial fibrillation following surgery do not exist but may be developed in the future.	1.1415780167859426
According to the clinical course, therapy has to consider ventricular rate control, prevention of thromboembolic events, and rhythm control.	1.1575280542887414
Usually therapy is restricted to the postoperative time.	0.9437625577621045
Atrial fibrillation after cardiothoracic surgery has to be respected in order to minimize overall complication rate.	1.0565819012076525
The influence of aspirin treatment on haemostasis is still under debate.	0.7624822960797174
There are doubts in emergency operations, especially in transplant patients, concerning dosage and change in medication.	1.0786369846641874
Our results are based on an analysis of the therapeutic approaches in German transplantation centres.	0.9940924785210261
The question of transplant suitability, dosage and haemostatic effects are discussed with respect to the literature.	1.0316910541820474
Some 92.11 % of the transplantation centres perform the operation even though the patient has been treated with aspirin.	1.2448649970772527
In these cases an increased bleeding tendency is tolerated and observed in 34.2 % of the centres.	1.1496502560649666
An increased mortality has not been reported.	0.8664440106350935
Most of the transplantation centres accept a dosage of 100 mg aspirin daily.	0.8672801169019614
Only 7.89 % of the transplantation centres refuse to operate on aspirin-treated patients.	0.9891889012277529
Correctly indicated aspirin treatment (for cardiac arrhythmia, embolism, or thrombosis, for example) does not contraindicate renal transplantation (daily dosage up to 100 mg).	1.0783933533146688
In elective surgery, however, a preoperative change in medication is recommended, e. g., the heparin instead of aspirin.	0.9449038331835676
Full-thickness defects of the thoracic wall following tumor resection, irradiation damage or secondary wound healing in thoracic surgery require early interdisciplinary cooperation to achieve patient-specific treatment modalities.	0.9939029924658049
Plastic surgical differential therapy allowing for sufficient soft tissue coverage, stabilisation of the thoracic wall and space filling in intrathoracic cavities, is presented and critically discussed.	1.0935854888473018
Incomplete anaesthesia is a major clinical problem both in single spinal and in single epidural anaesthesia.	1.0250204331306576
The clinical efficacy of epidural anaesthesia with augmentation (aEA) and combined epidural and spinal anesthesia (CSE) for cesarean section was investigated in a prospective randomized study on 45 patients.	1.1065811895550626
This retrospective study presents the results of 41 patients with a lateral clavicle fracture eight years after the treatment at the Staatliche Orthopädische Klinik of the LMU München in the time between 31.10.1979 and 31.10.1994.	1.2034787120022157
It could be shown that the lateral clavicle fractures, due to their variety, hold a special position among the clavicle fractures and thus need a differanciated therapeutic procedure.	0.9639995213386617
Among the operation methods the K-wire stabilisaton with cerclage was the most often chosen operation technique i.e.	0.892506329346731
The K-wire without cerclage was used in two cases.	0.8897651608308261
Twelfe fractures were treated with AO-plate-osteosynthesis.	0.8365435713313311
Three fractures had to be treated by resection, as they produced two pseudarthrosis and one serious AC-arthrosis during the conservative therapy.	1.170354171662684
92,7% of the subjective results of the 41 checked up patients were good and very good.	1.237786442437403
The clinical follow-up of 36 and the radiological follow-up of 33 patients revealed in 97% a good and very good outcome in the Boenisch-Score.	1.3529837271552951
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and multiple sclerosis are thought to stem from autoimmunological processes.	0.7817241643292767
We describe a 14 year old female adolescent, in whom both diseases manifested almost at the same time.	1.2863254511327118
A prospective long-term follow-up study in patients who had had surgical therapy for renal hyperparathyroidism was launched to investigate the results of surgical treatment and to evaluate possible correlations between preoperative laboratory values and the course of the symptoms.	1.1943615870075115
From August 1987 to December 1995, 79 patients underwent surgery for renal hyperparathyroidism.	0.8527418637016992
It was the first neck exploration for 72 patients.	1.1292684482930038
Total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation to a forearm was our preferred procedure (n = 67).	1.0173105269775646
The postoperative course of all patients is known.	1.213991437267432
We carried out one to nine reexaminations (median 4) in 74 of 79 patients.	1.1540268429030505
The follow-up period ranged from 1 month to 5 years with a median of 18 months.	1.2407056802132255
After the operation transient hypocalcaemia occurred in 84.8 % of patients.	0.9931182485114626
Postoperative hypocalcaemia correlated negatively with the preoperative levels of alkaline phosphatase and intact parathyroid hormone.	0.7457398384770668
Within the first month after surgery 60 % of the preoperatively affected patients completely recovered from pruritus, whereas the skeletal syndrome took longer to disappear.	1.1164315029731708
One year after surgery 75 % of the patients with pruritus and 79 % of those with skeletal syndrome had became asymptomatic.	1.233430917652458
After total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation, patients with preoperatively elevated concentrations of alkaline phosphatase ( > 200 U/l) experienced faster relief from joint pain than patients with preoperatively normal concentrations (P = 0.0297).	0.9973205750091475
To date 4.5 % of the patients developed recurrent hyperparathyroidism after total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation.	1.033618732723102
Morbidity of surgery for renal hyperparathyroidism is influenced by patients' risk factors.	0.9028067589829035
Postoperative hypocalcaemia correlates negatively with the grade of renal osteopathy at the time of operation.	0.8840609914878068
Preoperative concentrations of alkaline phosphatase influence the rapidity of the relief from joint pain.	0.7188759303977946
Coronary artery stenosis with need for therapy is rarely seen in childhood.	0.9793050697304726
A 15-year-old girl with hypercholesterinaemia type II a was undergoing lipid aphereses therapy (once or twice a week) since she was 6 years old.	0.9483329258221695
Single stage urthroplasty with an onlay patch graft of penile skin or buccal mucosa is an effective treatment for patients with complex anterior urethral stricture disease.	0.8446921301014129
Using buccal mucosa, operative time is substantially reduced by using a two-team approach in which one team harvests the graft from the mouth while a perineal team simultaneously exposes and calibrates the stricture.	0.9684756676955386
Excellent results can be expected using grafts urethral substitution in men with refractory bulbar strictures.	0.9132884193166486
Focal areas of severe stenosis may be excised from the graft bed.	0.81089347097922
For patients with long or dense strictures, grafts may easily be combined with other tissue transfer techniques.	0.9027173233095475
Background: As the slit-lamp technique is an restrictive method for the in-vivo examination and documentation of the multi-layer structure and the dynamics of the tear film and the cornea, e. g. during wound-healing processes, our aim was to find out whether it is possible to change the confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscope (CLSO; Zeiss) into a high-resolution confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) for the visualization of the anterior segments of the eye and the tear film by adapting a special objective system.	1.198074804809936
In order to gain information concerning the function of such a cornea microscope we examined selected patients with erosion or pterygium before and after operation and subsequent phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK), as well as some in-vitro corneal surfaces after photorefractive keratectomy (PRK).	1.08194668262699
From 3 years' experience with nearly 100 transinguinal preperitoneal mesh prosthesis (TIPP) repairs for recurrent inguinal hernia the indication, anesthesia, modification of the technique, and results are reported.	0.955990124496062
After intraoperative classification of the hernia, the TIPP repair is indicated especially in large defects of the posterior wall (L/M III).	1.0818037902007795
The procedure is easily performed under local anesthesia.	0.731545810554077
During 52 local TIPP repairs, conversion of anesthesia was never necessary.	0.8196269854928967
Important technical details include the requirement for a sufficient size of mesh (10 cm x 15 cm) and a certain caudal and cranial fixation of the prosthesis using at least three interrupted stitches for each.	1.1972307926317654
Apart from an increased number of seromas (12 %) in the early postoperative period, the results of the TIPP are comparable with those obtained after Shouldice repair for recurrent hernia.	1.1564514328623494
The rate of hematomas, infections, and testicular complications range between 1 % and 3 %.	1.2017770125335014
Considering the negative case selection of only large recurrent hernias, the TIPP repair reveals a favourably low 1-year recurrence rate of 1 %.	1.0793742055192481
If representatives of the law suspect anyone of drug smuggling by internal bodily concealment and refers the person to hospital, the doctor is requested to recover the ingested drug packets by induction of emesis with syrup of ipecacuanha or apomorphin a.	0.9197969118920359
The permission of this induction as a coercive measure is controversial.	0.7649935518991541
The policemen, the public prosecutor or the judge has to decide, whether the induction of emesis is really necessary, the physician has to declare the risks.	1.1072116756802917
Especially when there are only a few drug-containers and the person is no professial "body-packer", non-invasive diagnostic ways also can lead the evidence of incorporated drugs.	1.1226310178984464
Rupture of the drug containers leads to acute intoxication and the physician must regard the person as his patient, he has to refuse the role as medical expert for the representatives of law.	1.0909759254969833
The deformity in severe spondylolisthesis consists of two components: the parallel anterocaudad slip of the spondylolisthetic vertebra, and its tilt into kyphotic malposition.	1.0425006617389483
The influence of the two components is very different: the anterocaudad slippage has not much impact on the sagittal profile of the spine and is easily compensated for by a slight increase in lumbar lordosis.	1.1608885632184338
The kyphotic deformity has a high impact on trunk imbalance and the sagittal profile.	0.8934562171054661
There are two compensation mechanisms: hyperlordosis of the lumbar spine to its anatomical extremes and - if that is not sufficient - verticalisation of the sacral bone, performed by contracture of the hamstrings and uprighting of the pelvis around the hip joints.	1.109735467649061
The latter mechanism is followed by functional disadvantages.	0.7824929742299545
Therefore, correction of the kyphosis of L5 may be considered during operative treatment if the lumbosacral kyphosis (angle delta) is less than 85  ° and the sacral inclination less than 35  °.	1.1880031449353157
The diagnosis of malalignments of the lower extremities includes analysis of the geometry of the whole leg.	0.983453559348416
The first step in the diagnostic process is a standardized physical examination.	1.068642874214448
It provides valuable background information for an effective radiological diagnosis.	0.8692036694712086
Even with a thorough standardized physical examination it is not possible to define exactly the deformity or decide on an operative procedure.	1.0388340097207494
The diagnosis of axis deviations in the frontal plane can be measured on a conventional plain X-ray of the whole leg.	1.1639320855423059
In this view it is very important that the knee joints are in a true a. p. view independent on torsional deformities of the lower legs.	1.193219709041382
Today the gold standard to measure the torsion and length of the lower extremities is the CT scan.	0.9421509814282631
However, the multitude of analytical methods for CT measurements described in the literature do not lend themselves readily to comparison; thus, it is difficult to identify a clear method of choice.	1.1302740803446671
Not every CT measurement is better than a physical examination.	0.783480292258152
Evidence of reproducibility and accuracy is a prerequisite for useful interpretation of the results.	0.7502639316184491
Up to this point in the literature there are only reference values for the Ulm CT Method.	1.1681432073821314
One alternative is the MR scan, which avoids radiological risks, but the reproducibility and accuracy of the MRI method are not as good as for the CT method.	1.210494574477731
Another alternative is ultrasound, where recent advances in the measurement of torsion and length of the lower extremities have proven competitive with or superior to the accuracy of MRI.	1.0236110302662413
The three-dimensional determination of the torsion and length of the lower extremities by ultrasound has now assumed a leading role in the non-radiological diagnosis of malalignments of the lower extremities in children and adolescents.	0.9754309956975322
This method furthermore is increasingly being used in preoperative planning of leg deformities in adults.	0.8404739584943074
Purpose: Management of organ-confined RCC is primarily surgical.	1.0988813879770913
5-year survival rates of all stages improved from 40 % in the 1950th to 50 % in the 60th, and stagnate at 60 % in recent series.	1.4295846491010884
Paramount use of ultrasound in modern medicine has been claimed to contribute significantly to an earlier detection of RCC thus better amenable for radical operation.	0.9430400834471199
Other factors may have been strategies and general hospital care.	0.8767244195871459
However, it remains unclear whether an extended lymph node dissection as suggested vy Robson in a seminal paper in the 1960th bears any therapeutic value.	1.0684152575263235
Selected patients with minor lower limb injuries and low risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), who required cast immobilizing and did not receive medical thrombosis prophylaxis, were included in a prospective study.	1.155974631828208
The decision to give not medical thrombosis prophylaxis depended on an concept of individualised prophylaxis for patients at risk for thromboembolism.	1.0118967090076958
From March 1994 to March 1996 in 178 outpatients (118 men, 60 women, mean age 25,8 [16-39] years) a clinical examination and a colour-coded duplex sonography were performed after removel of the cast for detection of DVT of the lower limb.	1.103309417614091
A phlebographie was performed when thrombosis was suspected.	0.7020583914494644
Two patients developed a one bundle thrombosis of the calf.	0.884326376552194
Clinical appearance of lung embolism was not observed.	0.8888467573672485
These results suggest, that low risk patients with minor injuries of the lower limb and plaster cast immobilisation do not need a medical thrombosis prophylaxis.	1.1861184270179377
For the judgment of the quality of medical services and for the progress of clinical medicine the comparison of data and informations of the diagnostic and therapeutic process is demanded.	1.1486479431136796
Therefore a systematic and concrete system of documentation should be implemented in every clinic, which consists of standard nomenclature, classification, instruments of outcome measure and documentation standards.	0.9506791266689734
There are a group of problems and barriers which stand in the way of this goal.	0.9249139179659638
It is useful to build a minimum basis data set which includes core criterias of clinical dokumentation in orthopedic surgery and include this in an information system so that all of these parts are considered and that a central and comparable data pool is offered for patient care, quality management and research.	1.0512907552532347
Basal cell adenocarcinoma was first introduced as an entity in the second edition of the WHO's "Histologic Typing of Salivary Gland Tumours" in 1991.	1.1870845236755545
This tumor was first described in 1990 by Ellis and Wiskovitch from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP).	0.7719697034575425
Basal cell adenocarcinoma accounts for about 2.9% of all salivary gland malignancies.	1.189133980150084
More than 90% of the tumors are situated in the parotid gland.	1.052756106361578
Intraoral manifestations are known from case reports only.	0.8052515803460432
Tumors of the palate have been mentioned in three cases.	0.8177281948293857
Histologically this tumor can be easily confused with basal cell adenoma and the solid basaloid subtype of adenoid cystic carcinoma.	0.8539956371473264
The case presented here is a middle-aged white woman with a basal cell adenocarcinoma of the palate.	1.0831533879958566
Therapy consisted of surgical extirpation with three-dimensional safety margins and histologically proven clear resection margins.	0.8888664692844233
Knowledge at this point indicates that basal cell adenocarcinoma has a rather high probability of local recurrence (up to 50%) and a mostly lymphogenous metastatic potential for as long as  10 years after removal of the primary tumor.	1.1787407215316343
Ten year survival is around 75%.	0.736885616662656
Purpose: To study the incidence and shape of subclinical keratoconus with corneal topography in the fellow eye in the case of clinically, slit-lamp biomicroscopically and topographically diagnosed unilateral disease.	1.0209492947720489
Ischemic heart disease is the most frequent cause of death in industrialized countries.	1.0503414959691502
This is a result of persistent risk factors and aging of the population.	1.1521707403703279
Medical progress with application of conservative, surgical or interventional strategies indeed reduced the morbidity and mortality of arteriosclerotic diseases, but markedly increased the medical care costs.	1.1786998886605262
The result is a discussion about the optimal use of the different therapeutic measures under consideration of the evidence based medicine.	1.14312191622996
The ileal conduit is a simple and safe supravesical urinary diversion with few postoperative complications.	0.7891042027690501
In patients with liver disease with portal hypertension, however, the risk of recurrent, peracute conduit bleeding is increased.	1.0316964738555365
While the diagnosis is simple, several therapeutic options are available.	1.1621675343679292
In most cases the bleeding comes from stomal varices, that can be controlled with local sclerotherapy with 3% Ethoxyscerol or ligation of the bleeding vessel.	1.1238468613450714
The resection of the part of the conduit carrying the varices is an option if bleeding is life threatening or the source cannot be localised.	0.9629277896923784
If bleeding recurs excision of the conduit should be considered.	0.7547496654390891
Malignant disease must be excluded as a bleeding source.	0.768766740155212
Objectives: The cardiotoxic properties of bupivacain have been well documented under in-vitro, as well as under in-vivio conditions.	0.9744956679821583
A further mechanism of cardiovascular impairment by bupivacaine via the central nervous system gained investigational interest in animal studies.	0.8666796803479906
The aim of our study was to demonstrate the effect of a ventriculocisternal perfusion of bupivacain on systemic hemodynamic variabels and their reversability by wash-out with mock-CSF.	0.9047849822707263
In recent years, our knowledge concerning pathophysiological changes in brain metabolism after traumatic brain injury (TBI) has greatly expanded.	1.048983022815916
This, in turn, has enabled the development of specific pharmacological strategies for the supplementary treatment of brain-injured patients with the aim of reducing secondary brain damage.	1.2826365623365976
The present article focuses on the pathophysiology of TBI and the possibilities for pharmacological intervention.	0.9158525455884472
While some of the substances reviewed are presently used in the treatment of TBI, others are under experimental and clinical evaluation at different stages.	1.005993857795259
This study explored characteristic subjective experiences of schizophrenia.	0.6283249473543933
A questionnaire for self-assessment of disturbances in several cognitive and perceptual areas (the Eppendorf Schizophrenia Inventory, or ESI) was constructed and administered to first-episode schizophrenics (SCHe, n=45), negative syndrome schizophrenics (SCHn, n=45), remitted schizophrenics (SCHr, n=24), depressives (DEP, n=43), alcoholics (ALK, n=48), obsessive-compulsive patients (ZWA, n=46), and healthy controls (KON, n=57).	1.1238130016704746
Comparisons between the SCHe, SCHn, DEP, ALK, and ZWA groups and a subsequent factor analysis revealed four schizophrenia-specific dimensions: attention and speech impairment (AS), ideas of reference (IR), auditory uncertainty (AU), and deviant perception (DP).	1.1064805297048448
Further analyses suggested that the AS syndrome may represent a mediating vulnerability factor while IR, AU, and DP probably are reversible episode indicators.	0.9171425058693866
The results may contribute to refinements in the measurement of specific prepsychotic signs, thus facilitating the development of early intervention approaches.	1.0109316901439749
Introduction: The conservative treatment of the most severe cases of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) can be sometimes frustrating.	1.3150024271334069
Especially with an underlying autoimmunologic disorder, even the application of artificial tears as often as every 5 min may not prevent further damage to the ocular surface.	1.050072258597256
A microvascular transplantation of the autologous submandibular gland (SG) can be performed by a maxillo-facial surgeon as an alternative approach for those cases.	1.0917083356605966
We report 2 years of ophthalmological experience with the results of this procedure.	1.248113028880931
Aims: The predominant cause of death due to oral cancer is the failure to control local tumor due to regional tumor recurrence.	1.1473491635511726
The sequelae of surgical resection and high-dose irradiation cause substantial changes in head and neck anatomy, leading to considerable problems in the early morphological detection of recurrent disease.	1.1973510445033593
Therefore, this study evaluates the verification of cancer recurrence by means of its pathologic glucose metabolism.	1.2238565520502593
Materials and methods: We reviewed a total of 50 [18F]-2-fluordeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET) investigations performed in 44 patients who had undergone surgical resection of oral cancer.	1.2743145563440905
In 23 cases, re-staging (group A) was indicated due to suspicion of recurrent or secondary tumor manifestation.	1.0883775393817463
In 27 cases, PET served as a screening procedure (group B).	0.988463619942013
Statistic evaluation included sensitivity, specifity, positive/negative predictive value and accuracy of 18FDG-PET for the detection of tumor manifestation.	0.9446079225167694
Results: 18FDG-PET correctly identified 23 of 26 tumor sites (88%) in the re-staging group and 9 of 10 tumor sites (90%) in the screening group.	1.2572711215044465
We encountered a total number of 16 false-positive foci with an increased 18FDG-uptake.	1.0266573166656627
In six patients, 18FDG-PET detected tumor recurrence several months before a morphological correlative could be identified.	0.7576017401152796
In 5 of these 6 patients, the PET findings for the latter tumor sites determined the patient's fate.	1.146030035591742
Specificity was 63% for local recurrence, 97% for secondary lymph node involvement and 90% for distant metastasis.	1.3082079464237304
Conclusion: According to these data, 18FDG-PET is the most effective diagnostic tool in the follow-up of oral cancer patients to date.	1.1793144462260454
Due to the high prevalence of recurrent disease in the follow-up of oral cancer, either the detection of early recurrence or the identification of additional, incurable tumors may add substantially to a rational therapeutic management.	1.1572154644549113
We therefore recommend 18FDG-PET for screening and re-staging of recurrent oral cancer.	0.9627083213934859
In over 80 % of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease, the Nissen antireflux fundoplication gives good long-term results.	1.033004993170879
Dysphagia, inability to belch or vomit as well as the gas bloat syndrome are possible sequelae after fundoplication.	1.0033092457493327
The frequency of these symptoms could be reduced by modification of the original Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication into the so-called "floppy" Nissen fundoplication, a short and loose wrap of mobilized gastric fundus.	1.092301993057936
Failures of the antireflux procedure are mainly due to disruption or displacement of the wrap with the telescope phenomenon.	0.7604623368892124
Here, reoperation with refashioning of the original wrap may lead to same functional results like a primary fundoplication.	0.9412424601858627
Technical alternatives may selectively be chosen, when gastroesophageal reflux disease is complicated by fixated hiatal hernia, esophageal shortening, or serious esophageal motility disorders.	0.9315262483895205
Such specific anatomic or functional abnormalities are detected by preoperative endoscopy, barium swallow, 24-h pH monitoring, and manometry.	0.9711901054016713
Alternative techniques are mainly transthoracic repairs, including the Nissen fundoplication, Collis gastroplasty, and the Belsey Mark IV.	1.198857359453309
Modifications of the 360  ° Nissen operation are partial fundoplications like the Hill repair and the Toupet dorsal fundoplication.	0.7840260350662634
Because of a high failure rate in the long-term follow-up, application of the ligamentum teres cardiopexy and of the Angelchik prosthesis is not recommended.	1.0731426279209675
We report a sporadic case of giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) starting in a 5-year-old boy with gait disturbance.	1.162620390986502
At the age of 10 years he showed signs of a sensomotoric polyneuropathy and central neurological symptoms: intention tremor, nystagmus and visual disturbance.	0.888572753137242
The boy also had curly hair.	0.5968099648634808
Sural nerve biopsy showed many giant axons with accumulation of microfilaments, which were also found in cytoplasma of Schwann cells, endothelial cells and fibrocytes.	1.1146356308607976
Similar changes were detected in endothelial cells of a muscle biopsy, which additionally displayed neurogenic atrophy and target fibers.	1.0494123438079463
Immunohistochemically, desmin, vimentin, heat shock protein 70, and ubiquitin were not detectable in giant axons, which, however, contained neurofilament protein 68, 200 and  -tubulin.	1.1693649864864422
Our case shows that careful ultrastructural examination of a muscle biopsy may point to the diagnosis of GAN.	0.9255716775781113
The endoscopic release of the carpal ligament gives the opportunity to treat the carpal tunnel syndrome in a comfortable and minimal invasive way.	0.939055793004775
Between 1 October 1994 and 7 May 1995, 46 patients who underwent endoscopic surgery on 55 hands were documented in a prospective study.	1.1038388525487726
The following results were taken from a questionnaire.	0.8825291267104399
There were not any complaints, or the complaints were so much diminished that complete division of the carpal ligament could be viewed as accomplished in 51 of 55 cases.	1.0163659163556307
There were continuing complaints in four cases, and after an additional check two patients were operated on again.	1.1805917099663024
The advantage of the endoscopic method is the inconspicuous scar and the reduced postoperative disablement.	0.9564972579518813
For surgical removal of a malignant choroid melanoma, it is necessary to reduce systolic blood pressure to around 50-60 mmHg in order to prevent choroidal haemorrhages.	1.1720054391179393
However, blood pressure reduction is associated with the risk of cerebral ischaemia.	1.4163276181247162
We report a patient with a malignant choroid melanoma in whom waves I and II of the brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP) disappeared during surgery under controlled arterial hypotension and hypothermia (31.1 ° C).	1.0746611410784863
The waves could be recorded again immediately after the mean arterial pressure was increased from 48 to 77 mmHg.	0.959538625571153
The oesophageal temperature had dropped by 0.3 ° C at this time.	0.9805048011106529
The 2-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) showed no irregularities during this time period.	1.0232141076398247
A bilateral, reversible, apparently blood-pressure-dependent loss of waves I and II during arterial hypotension despite a normal EEG has to our knowledge not been previously described in the literature.	0.9691563331162434
The isolated loss of waves I and II with maintenance of waves III, IV, and V is unusual.	0.9929709014651268
The literature contains reports of acoustic neurinoma patients in whom only wave V could be recorded.	0.9753671075657356
This is regarded as an indication of continued impulse conduction despite the loss of waves I to IV.	0.9353793218957662
Others have observed a patient with temporary and reversible loss of BAEP wave I due to vasospasm of the internal auditory artery that apparently occurred during or shortly after manipulation of the internal auditory meatus.	1.0371506906442545
Assuming anatomic peculiarities in the blood supply to the generators of the BAEP waves, a stenosis of the basilar artery could be considered as the cause of the bilateral reversible loss of waves I and II.	1.0403025159210266
Another potential source could be the induced hypothermia, but this does not seem very likely because the patient's temperature was 0.3 ° C lower at the return of the waves than at their loss.	1.2097757107635236
In the syndrome arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia cardiomyopathy, little is known to date about the mechanism for the development of arrhythmias.	0.9834270032386218
In a group of 54 patients with documented ventricular tachycardia during longterm ECG recordings, the determinants for the development of VT and the relationship between signal-averaged ECG and the morphological characteristics of the disease are investigated.	1.1222151012664907
The analysis of the long-term electrocardiographic data includes the measurement of RR-intervals 30, 15, 5, 1min and immediately before onset of the VT, the determination of the morphology of the previous ventricular premature beats, and the frequency of the atrial arrhythmias.	1.1102781472903152
Normal values for the analysis of late potentials in the ECG signal accquisition with bidirectional filters between 40 and 300Hz were defined a maximum of 113ms for a QRS width, LAS of 38ms, and RMS40 of 16uV.	0.9724289055148139
The analysis of the long-term ECG produced monomorphic VT in all cases without previous atrial arrhythmia and in only 4 cases with previous polymorphic ventricular premature beats.	1.0280847299354048
A long-short phenomenon could only be proven in 4VT episodes.	0.917369259283305
In 84% of all tachycardias, no arrhythmia were found immediately before onset of the arrhythmic event.	1.15377100804786
According to the circadian clock, two peaks, mornings between 6 and 9h and evenings between 6 and 9h, could be determined.	1.0112795269575454
In patients, who were recently diagnosed with ARVD, a significant shortening of the RR intervals before the onset of VT as an indication of an acceleration of the sinus rhythm was observed.	1.1611318957913286
This effect could not be observed in patients with a past medical history of AVRD.	1.080364112377933
Late potentials were determined with a prevalence of 74% overall.	0.9468645393369107
Increasingly, late potentials were observed with morphologically diffuse forms of the ARVD.	1.0936546966450105
A correlation to the severity of spontaneous arrhythmias (ventricular, sustained or not sustained VT) could not be established.	0.9612495553448119
In comparison to the origin of VT in coronary heart disease, previous arrhythmias play a less important role in arrhymogenic right ventricular dysplasia cardiomyopathy.	1.0679547073616145
Most importantly, an intensified sympathetic tone before onset of VT and an increased prevalence of positive late potentials are observed.	1.081580746012194
We present the case of a 54-year-old male patient with a Syme amputation of his left leg following diabetic gangrene of the foot.	0.8454181235071072
A  local infection of the stump was treated successfully with two  endoscopic debridements and lavage.	0.9230894381099363
Additionally, the patient received local antibiotics by the application of antibiotic collagenous fleece and antibiotic chains.	1.1491190447133202
This therapeutic management combined with early weight bearing led to a stable stump.	0.9004124396045228
We describe an eighteen-months-old boy, who suffered from congenital vitium cordis, jejunalatresia, microcephaly, facial dysmorphies and psychomotor retardation in connection with a partial monosomy of the short arm of chromosome 8.	0.8650985571836164
In most cases the genesis of brachial plexus palsy is traumatic, often because of bike accidents.	1.0388916545821043
If physiotherapy and neurosurgical procedures such as nerve repair do not have the desired outcome, muscle transfer operations are possible.	0.9330030498915514
The results of our favored transfer of the trapezius muscle to compensate paralysis of the deltoid muscle will be presented.	1.0120253400896724
Preoperatively radiological, clinical and electromyographic examinations are necessary.	1.0239731607814377
Our results are based upon the clinical and radiological check ups and the subjective assessment of the patients.	1.0636582468320028
Thirty-one patients (7 female, 24 male) underwent a trapezius transfer between March 1994 and December 1996.	1.0756976452491622
The average age was 29 years (range 18-46 years).	1.1089667813805288
We performed the operations using a modification of Saha's technique.	0.6755804340494946
With the patient in lateral decubitus position and protection of the opposite plexus, a sagital skin incision is the first step, followed by the preparation of trapezius and deltoid muscle as well as the bony parts of the shoulder (acromion, clavicle, scapular spine).	1.1670435299463011
The deltoid origin is cut from the lateral third of the clavicle, the acromion and the lateral half of the scapular spine.	1.0722048541621914
The next step is transection of the root of the acromion and the lateral clavicle.	0.940995610913079
After elevation of the remaining trapezius insertions from the clavicle and scapular spine, the proximal humerus is exposured by splitting the partly detached deltoid muscle longitudinally.	1.0164723375503812
Then the acromion fragment and humerus are prepared for the bone-to-bone contact.	0.9719030872945609
In 90  ° of abduction the acromion fragment with its trapezius insertion is transferred and fixed to the humerus with two 4.5-mm screws.	1.1081790283994217
Finally the deltoid is sutured on the top of the trapezius and the skin is closed over two suction drains.	1.0039695906542523
Postoperatively we immobilize the operated arm in an abduction support for 6 weeks.	0.8098766571990258
The physiotherapy program starts on the first postoperative day with active training of elbow, hand and fingers and electrostimulation of the transferred trapezius muscle.	0.8971920013033475
Six weeks after the procedure we take an X-ray and start with progressive adduction of the arm.	1.094734321229598
The preoperative subluxation of the humeral head was abolished in all cases.	0.9042012087561576
We achieved an average increase of active abduction from 7.3  ° (range 0-45  °) preoperatively to 39.2  ° (range 25  °-80  °) 1 year after the operation; the increase of forward flexion was from 20  ° (range 0  °-85  °) to 43  ° (range 20  °-90  °).	1.2881274412262242
All patients were satisfied with the improvement of stability and function of the operated shoulder.	0.9972714002065871
Finally we can conclude that the trapezius transfer for flail shoulder gives a satisfactory outcome regarding shoulder function and stability as well as the subjective situation of the patients.	1.1494971825833677
We analyzed psychiatric and criminological data from 103 arsonists.	0.6824889962992577
The following criticisms of the definition of pyromania according to DSM-III-R and IDC-10 seem appropriate.	0.8174372850684978
First, the categoric exclusion of aggressive motives does not seem very promising, since approximately one fourth of arsonists whose firesetting is based on motives quoted in DSM-III-R may also have an aggressive motive.	1.0227167279314027
Second, ICD-10 gives being drunk and alcoholism as a criterion for the exclusion of pyromania.	0.796200657608598
This seems untenable, since the behavior classed as pyromania is largely a product of alcohol misuse.	0.9256037153231536
Repeated firesetting, resulting from being fascinated by fire etc., may be less a disturbance of impulse control but rather the manifestation of a psychoinfantilism, which, supported by alcohol abuse, extends into older age.	1.137239075571
The mean age of such arsonists is slightly above 20 years.	0.925822584363701
The tendency for relapses after imprisonment seems to be low; this tendency probably decreases spontaneously in older age.	0.9426808714803512
The mean age of arsonists with aggressive motives is a little below 30 years, those setting fire with suicidal motives have a mean age of 35, deluded arsonists have a mean age of 40 years.	1.0578508571982241
Concrete sexual motives are relatively rare.	0.5804796536925141
Approximately 50 % of arsonists have a purely aggressive motive.	0.9999770042931697
Retaliation is a rare cause, however, since most of them do not even know the victims.	1.3475967325513007
One third of these persons set the fire in their own homes.	0.9378473284839371
Most arsonists show a personality disorder, with insecurity and narcissism predominating.	0.9595369934445578
Data on firesetting are to be treated with caution, since two thirds of all cases are newer resolved; one fourth of cases concern minors, and in Central Europe arsonists with rational motives are hardly ever referred to psychiatrists.	1.1736833331029062
A normal ciliary beat frequency of ciliated cells is necessary for the mucociliary clearance of the nose and paranasal sinuses.	0.8640341330432523
An in vitro investigation was performed to eval-uate the influence of topical corticosteroids and antihistamines on the ciliary beat frequency of human nasal mucosa.	1.02650127154603
The nasal sprays examined contained the corticosteroids budesonide or fluticasone propionate and the topical antihistamines azelastine or levocabastine.	0.7290091954561381
All tests were performed on cell cultures of human nasal mucosa during constant conditions.	0.8945663982493173
Three of the four nasal sprays tested contained benzalkonium chloride as preservative.	0.8446215754804448
An irreversible cessation of ciliary movement was observed in all cells exposed to nasal sprays containing benzalkonium chloride in a 50 per cent solution.	0.9198521470457272
The nasal spray containing budesonide was benzalkonium chloride-free and caused minor but fully reversible decreases in ciliary beat frequency after 20 min.	0.8314126509941306
As benzalkonium chloride can cause complete standstill of ciliary beat frequency in vitro in human nasal mucosa, we recommend that this preservative should not be used anymore in topical nasal medications.	1.0361131535921573
The treatment of patients with severe burn injuries is expensive and belongs in the hands of specialized burn centres.	1.0362800611709693
In our burn centre 257 patients were treated from 1991 to June 1995 (between 50 and 60 patients per year except for 1993 with 77 patients).	0.9214127016191812
Patients were evaluated according to the ABSI score (mean 7) and had mortality of around 15%.	1.1702164753474553
The costs range between 3.7 and 4.8 million DM per year, the profit lies in the same range.	1.228904779662482
The costs are divided into staff costs (1.4 - 1.8 million DM per year), costs for medical treatment (1.5 - 1.9 million DM per year) and costs for internal services (600 000 - 900 000 DM per year) such as laboratory examinations (247 000 - 386 000 DM per year) and blood bank (100 000 - 215 000 DM per year), the main factors in this category.	1.2458274483116036
The different fields of costs and profit are compared in this analysis.	0.8708135830406151
Possible ways of reducing costs are pointed out, and the question of effectiveness of therapy is discussed.	1.2557559301411507
Conclusions from this analysis are limited by the individuality of each case with different clinical courses, the great number of influencing factors and the comparably small numbers of patients.	1.042222853093649
In benign laryngotracheal stenosis the amount of respiratory deterioration rather than the crude morphologic appearance will determine whether or not surgical measures such as dilatation or resection should be applied.	0.8374340461150976
This review focusses on currently available and newly developed diagnostic tools to assess the functional importance of central airway obstruction.	0.9085996560970822
After an outline of upper airway physiology is formulated, spirometric measurements at rest are collected.	0.7927396256736741
Among these, Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEF) proved to be the simplest and most reliable parameter to monitor an obstructing lesion of the upper airways.	1.117188098186269
A novel technique for fibrobronchoscopic assessment of glottic and tracheal resistance is presented in detail.	0.8859442700562421
In contrast to usual tests of total airflow resistance which cannot distinguish between central and peripheral contributions, this test identifies the pressure-flow-relationship created exclusively by the local lesion.	1.0749004302940004
In serial stenoses, it indicates which is of higher clinical impact.	1.1130911785558386
Patients with upper airway obstruction complain of impaired exercise capacity.	0.7505083868730477
They tend to hypoventilate with imminent respiratory muscle fatigue.	0.5958328424051279
Therefore, spiroergometry may play a role in defining the point of incomplete compensation of a central load.	1.1473155256512952
The decision to operate will depend upon up the degree of physical capacity required to compensate for the stenosis.	0.9989029370373494
Stroke units are hospital-based special wards aiming at optimal care by a specialized team with an integrated concept for patients with acute strokes.	1.0335451197634355
Following the initial neurolo-gical and neuroradiological evaluation, early treatment will be initiated based on the assumed pathophysiology of the stroke.	0.9934919079841664
Acute management includes monitoring of physiological, parameters, care by specialized nurses, and early implementation of physiotherapists, speech therapy and occupational therapy.	1.0066749866402789
Despite the increased initial costs, the long-term burden for the health system is decreased by shorter hospital stay and reduced morbidity and disability.	1.0521165978553995
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is the most important side-effect of heparin therapy.	1.0630440686593343
Two types of thrombocytopenia can be caused by heparin: a frequent non-immunologic type causing a minor decrease in thrombocyte count without apparent clinical importance and, on the other hand, an immunologic type accompanied by thromboembolic complications.	0.9798688558991184
Patients and methods: We report on two cases with HIT type II after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).	0.9885347853571438
HIT antibodies were demonstrated by ELISA for platelet-factor-4-heparin-complex and heparin-induced platelet-activation (HIPA) assay.	1.0366187569814944
Results: A 67 year old patient suffered from a HIT type II seven days after administration of heparin during myocardial revascularization.	1.0393271965840711
In this patient, a continuous fever and a signicantly reduced general condition were the primary symptoms.	1.2000523225854085
The clinical picture of this disease was reversible after aborting the heparin therapy.	1.0574610547567527
Thromboembolic complications did not occur.	0.19890341919125198
A 70 year old patient developed a HIT type II with thromboembolic complications 13 days after CABG.	1.0009631229091565
The vascular occlusions affected the A. spinalis anterior with the development of a spinalis anterior-syndrome, the coronary arteries with the development of myocadial infarction, and the A. iliaca interna.	1.1927215241486464
A white-clot syndrome with thrombi in the ascending aorta, in the left atrium, and in the left ventricle required an operation with extracorporal circulation including the use of recombinant hirudin for anticoagulation.	1.2088499040966536
Conclusion: With therapy with heparin, it is obligatory to check platelet count.	1.275068658804778
An indication for the development of HIT type II is a decrease in platelet count or thromboembolic complications during heparin therapy.	0.8865341766140951
In the case of HIT type II recombinant hirudin was a practical altenative as an anticoagulant for extracorporal circulation and for continous hemofiltration.	0.9148253409417734
Oxygen radicals and oxygen radial mediators are thought to be important components in the development of acute lung injury, sepsis, and multiple organ failure.	0.9831885546988205
Injured patients, patients with pulmonary diseases, and multiple trauma patients also showed an elevated lipid peroxidation, indicating increased oxidant stress.	1.262657306358513
N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) has been used as an antioxidant in a wide variety of experiments.	1.089013771351239
NAC has been suggested to act by raising concentrations of cysteine, and hence glutathione, and by scavenging of oxidant species [1, 11, 17, 29].	1.2226743214456053
The present study was designed to investigate whether the application of NAC in intubated patients has an effect on concentrations of reduced glutathione in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) and on the lipid peroxidation products malondialdehyde and conjugated dienes.	0.9697239752323449
Because NAC has been widely used as a mucolytic drug for the treatment of lung diseases, the influence on tracheobronchial mucus was studied, too.	1.1164809020673063
Between 1990 and 1995, 27 patients with posttraumatic disorders of the subtalar joint were treated by correcting fusion.	1.1028483958631807
Preoperatively 24 patients (88.89 %) suffered from pain; 15 (55.56 %) had a walking range below 100 m. Seven patients were unable to work in their original profession.	1.1542368876417703
After an average period of 13.85 months postoperatively the patients were examined again.	1.2367295228689068
At this time 18 (66.67 %) had no or minimal pain; 19 (70.37 %) had no claudication.	1.2706010183659273
According to the score of Angus and Skuginna, in 81.48 % of patients the result of the correcting arthrodesis was successful; according to Kitaoka's clinical rating system for ankle-hindfoot, midfoot, hallux and lesser toes, the average postoperative score was 75.8 points.	1.2427108061623664
Objective: To examine changes in Body Mass Index (BMI) in children in the last twenty years and to determine the prevalence of overweight and obesity.	1.2011399173853587
The review of medication has been recommended as an important part in preventing falls.	1.1791139996867044
In a random sample of 276 hospital in-patients aged 75 and over, the frequency of prescribed drugs which may increase the risk of falling by causing dizziness was assessed.	0.947270832670939
Questions about dizziness and previous falls were included in a standardized questionnaire.	0.926267974303679
Migration of an impacted mandibular premolar is a rare finding, whereas dystopia of lower jaw cuspids is described much more often in the literature.	1.1075668576560274
We present a patient in whom radiographic studies show the migration of a mandibular premolar to the muscular process over a period of 14 years.	0.9822113182966776
Most of the tooth migration along the vertical portion of the mandibula into the processus muscularis took place after the root development had ended.	0.8506023075228089
Neither radiological nor clinical examination revealed the stimulus which changed the path and the direction of the impacted tooth.	0.8778647510217784
In atopic eczema patients the well-known abnormal cutaneous reactivity of the blood vessels (white dermographism, delayed blanch after acetylcholine, paradoxical blanching after nicotinic acid application and diminished erythema after histamine injection) were observed during acute eczematous episodes and later in an eczema-free state in comparison with controls.	1.0806218199319615
In this follow-up study the use of different stimuli allowed us to demonstrate abnormal cutaneous vascular reactions in the patients depending on the severity of their atopic eczema.	1.1684932012274245
Severely affected patients showed persistence of the paradoxical vascular reactions even in an eczema-free cutaneous state.	0.8313873028428048
We report on a 9-year-old girl with a giant cell fibroblastoma of the right anterior chest wall.	1.136708944241744
This rare soft tissue tumour occurs predominantly in the first two decades of life.	1.1203516298639191
The typical clinical presentation is a solitary, usually 2-6 cm large, non-tender mass of blue-greyish colour which is mostly located on the back, anterior chest wall, thigh or groin.	1.1284946555474937
The histology shows a loose infiltrate of predominantly bland spindle cells in dermis and subcutis.	0.8116239550343219
Characteristic elements of the tumour are large angiectoid branching spaces lacking any endo- or epithelium, and relatively small multinucleated cells (floret cells).	1.0009452743029492
The recurrence rate is high if the tumour is not excised with adequate safety margins.	0.9393758509235434
It is of pre-eminent importance to differentiate this rare benign tumor from sarcomas, in order to avoid an inappropriately aggressive therapy.	1.1093341717141671
To correct severe septal deformities, it is often necessary to perform an extracorporal septoplasty with temporary removal of the deviated septal cartilage, followed by straightening and reimplantation into the nose as free graft.	1.0765020526605962
The utilization of a compound graft, which sutures the cartilage fragments to a resorbable polydioxanon (PDS) foil, facilitates this technique immediately while simultaneously ensuring support of the nasal dorsum.	0.9659548724080396
Stress incontinence is the most frequent form of incontinence found in females.	0.979535804968314
The usual method of surgery for this is to lift the bladder neck towards cranial and ventral.	0.9910011578264974
Two competitive techniques - bladder neck suspension in accordance with Stamey and colposuspension in accordance with Burch - were retrospectively investigated.	1.1237641933734308
A total of 95 women underwent surgery and it was possible to evaluate the postoperative course in 46 and 30 (total 76) patients respectively.	1.3415980040819653
Initially, both surgical techniques demonstrated a very good success rate (91.3 % and 96.7 % resp.).	1.2629656358491224
However, the continence rate of the Stamey patients deteriorated after 6 weeks down to 78.3 % and after more than 2 years only 28.6 % of these patients were still completely continent (mean follow-up 40.4 mths), whereas deterioration in the Burch patients was only 87 % (mean follow-up 44.25 mths).	1.3555904100025022
The disappointing results with the Stamey technique did not correlate with the degree of initial continence.	0.8737404530242276
It was noted here that obese patients showed a greater tendency towards regression.	0.951782790442347
The three cases of recurring incontinence after Burch colposuspension were already relapses at the time of surgery.	0.9710366289621146
With respect to long-term follow-up, our results with the Stamey method were distinctly poorer than with the Burch technique.	1.0196769232460705
Therefore, in our opinion, the Burch colposuspension procedure and fascioplasty should be the method of choice for the management of stress incontinence.	1.206496530338957
This paper is concerned with the relationship between social inequality and psychiatric disorders, an issue being neglected in German psychiatry for a long time.	0.9725025028696037
Social inequality will be discussed in it's dimensions "socioeconomic status" and "sex" referring to the present state of epidemiological and sociological knowledge.	1.0218620260080744
Because such macrosocial factors offer little explanation for the association with psychiatric disorders by themselves microsocial concepts of burden and resources are necessary to link the structural and the individual level.	0.9499577398165386
These concepts are considered to be one pathway by which the mechanisms to disease may occur.	1.0222481064103146
A short review of empirical findings and analytic approaches show the complexity of these mechanisms requiering further research not only because of analytic deficiences but also because of social change.	0.9306096409477296
Further research will concern in general the explanation of social patterns of diseases, in detail the link between individual stress and coping with the social structure, and last but not least a gender-sensitive approach to psychiatric disorders which is more differenciated.	1.0897463585140816
It is well known that alterations to the oral cavity caused by dental prostheses may affect speech articulation, although influences on the voice are not assumed.	1.0254709254144312
In addition to the vocal fundamental frequency, vibrations of the vocal chords generate overtones.	0.9494513907441477
Through the shape of the larynx and the upper airway, resonances and antiresonances are formed, and in this way overtones are amplified to a variable extent.	1.1371868686903939
Nozzle changes caused by a dental prosthesis in the oral cavity may possibly influence overtones but influences on the vocal fundamental frequency seem unlikely.	0.8937033009102793
The influence of dental prostheses on the voice is demonstrated in a patient who owned two different dental prostheses.	1.139980959524346
The fundamental frequency rose by up to five semitones during speech and his vocal range increased by up to four semitones when a thin denture was used instead of a normal denture.	0.9182158217208618
When the position of the mandible was checked by intraoral needle point placement, a more rostral position of the mandible was recorded with the thin denture than with the normal denture.	1.1082502086928518
Sagittal magnetic resonance tomography imaging also showed that the larynx was in a more cranial position.	1.0090237471008117
This change was presumed to be due to an upward movement of the larynx induced by the tongue, which itself was found to be in a more cranial position with the thin denture.	1.1334859694394026
In this situation, increased tension of the laryngeal muscles were believed to induce a rise in fundamental frequency, shifting the voice range toward higher frequencies.	0.9890611628080987
These findings show that dental prostheses can cause vocal changes in individual cases.	0.7878293484510619
The etiology of this occurrence is still not clear.	0.9533586090177264
Its consequences, however, should be known to the dentist, ENT surgeon and phoniatrist if patients notice changes in their voice after having altered or replaced their dentures.	0.9896190489259932
Cytokine blood levels are found to be moderately elevated in chronic heart failure, as a function of severity of disease.	1.1549272421582057
The source of these cytokines and the trigger mechanisms stimulating cytokine release are a matter of intense research.	0.8379470168497981
Potential players include bacterial endotoxin from intestinal translocation, a neurohumoral dysbalance with an enhanced sympathetic tone or an overspill of cytoines from the failing heart itself.	0.8527862251859792
We present arguments in favor of a direct link between the chronically enhanced sympathetic tone in heart failure and the clinically over activation of the immune system, particularly interleukin 6 release.	1.056820219236424
Objectives: This 1998 survey was carried out on the use of the sitting position for neurosurgical procedures in the posterior fossa and operations of the craniospinal and cervical spine region by the dorsal approach.	1.065323490053911
In addition, anesthetic management of the sitting position and the compliance with recommendations of the Neuroanesthesia Study Group of the German Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (DGAI) published in 1995 were investigated and compared to results of a 1995 survey.	1.2105339990699717
Polar body analysis is a perfect tool to exclude genetically altered oocytes prior to fertilisation.	0.8283676612308726
This helps to improve pregnancy rates and baby take home rates in assisted reproduction, primarily in advanced maternal age patients.	0.8853748127403221
This might reduce the need of invasive prenatal diagnosis for those patients.	0.9575284738766132
Polar body analysis offers treatment in reproductive medicine for female patients carrying a chromosomal aberration or a mutation before they become pregnant.	0.8651963509904704
However, it does not assess the genetic status of the embryo resulting from the oocyte tested and selected.	1.1381441958414091
The paternal contribution to the embryo is left unattended.	0.73729679933761
Ethical considerations do not play a role, since no manipulation or selection is performed on embryos.	1.0143971511954974
Pachydermoperiostosis (Friedreich-Erb-Arnold syndrome, Touraine-Solente-Golé syndrome) is a rare disease with an autosomal dominant mode of unheritance; it occurs almost exclusively in men.	1.001636352915841
A report of typical pachydermoperiostosis in a 31-year-old man is presented.	0.993917841464465
Associated features were clubbed digits of the hands and feet with watch-crystal nails, thickening of the skin and soft tissues, hyperhidrosis of hands and feet, hyperplasia of the sebaceous glands with seborrhoea, gynaecomastia, and ophthalmic abnormalities that had been present since puberty.	0.888840958689635
Radiological examination revealed periosteal hyperostosis of the short and long bones.	0.9555605910011188
Endocrine disturbances were not detected.	0.5864582723125311
Skin biopsies showed hypertrophy of the skin and skin appendages.	1.0377122174108453
Primary (idiopathic, hereditary) pachydermoperiostosis should be distinguished from secondary (symptomatic) forms of the disease, which are often associated with lung tumours.	1.0291154887861504
The following review will examine the outcome of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy treatment studies of anorexia and bulimia nervosa.	0.9675885710430382
For both eating disorders, psychotherapy is the treatment of choice.	0.795184084888466
In clinical practice "treatment packages" are offered to account for the complexity of the disorders.	0.9705009119065459
In bulimia nervosa, cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques have dominated the literature and appear to be successful.	0.9081847413973707
Newer studies reporting on the use of interpersonal therapy also find considerable improvement of symptoms.	0.6955816002315792
Antidepressive medication can be useful in the treatment of bulimia nervosa.	0.9143197684896976
Recently, a stepped care approach to treatment has been recommended, with self-care manuals as the first step.	1.2904224222602325
In anorexia nervosa there is a paucity of controlled clinical trials.	0.7748408120719481
Contingency management for weight restoration can be viewed as a necessary element in all in- and outpatient treatments.	1.0528878028471287
Family therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and psychodynamic approaches have proven useful in clinical practice; however, only a limited data base exists regarding the efficacy of these therapies.	1.1565173611268214
Medication should not be used routinely in the treatment of anorexia nervosa.	1.0122703964792534
Absorption of irrigating fluid in transurethral prostatic resection (TURP) and percutaneous nephrolitholapaxy (PNL) into veins or delayed absorption due to fluid extravasation may result in a TURP syndrome.	0.9262253093495524
The measurement of end-tidal breath alcohol concentration (et AC) as a monitor of absorption of irrigating fluid labelled with 2% ethanol is limited by the disturbance of infrared sensors by volatile anaesthetics and nitrous oxide (N2O) (Fig.	1.0312211691438988
An electrochemical sensor is acceptable for this method.	0.8040805450104026
The aim of the present study was the evaluation of breath alcohol measurements using an electrochemical sensor device (Alcomed 3010, Envitec).	0.9615341768277832
The stability of the sensor in the presence of volatile anaesthetics was examined using a lung model.	0.7843560638407249
In a clinical investigation, the device was then applied to spontaneously breathing or mechanically ventilated patients inhaling volatile anaesthetics during endoscopic urological surgery.	0.9741054027310969
Skin diseases, the psyche and psychological changes are often intertwined, especially in patients presenting for expert dermatologic opinion.	1.1672482756426883
In many cases an additional evaluation provided by psychotherapeutic medicine may be necessary.	0.945264848158965
This resource may help with the diagnosis, explanation of the problem and estimation of the degree of disability.	1.0533304804984043
The different legal guidelines of the various evaluation boards must be considered.	0.8939445117099935
The role of psychotherapeutic evaluation is demonstrated through case examples.	0.7472662833108152
The evaluation of new possibly occupationally-related disorders such as multiple chemical sensitivity and mobbing is considered.	0.8874207264784284
We investigated the impact of old age on the antidepressant effect of sleep deprivation.	0.7593696212776628
32 depressive inpatients were assessed before and after sleep deprivation by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.	0.8345592444004717
The patients were divided into two groups according to their age.	0.8721642021226006
The result showed no negative impact of old age on the anti-depressant effect of sleep deprivation.	0.7327308963455618
During MRI-controlled resection of brain tumors using an open MRI system, operation-induced alterations may occur, especially enhancement of the resection cavity wall.	1.1678430886319626
This may simulate tumor areas, resulting in false assessment of the resection or resection of non-tumorous areas.	0.9785076719893765
Based on 42 MRI- and biopsy-controlled brain tumor resections in an 0.5 T open MRI (Signa SP, GE), the appearance and origin of operation-induced reactions are analyzed.	1.1165906021244114
In our opinion, there is a superposition of preformed peritumoral reactions by operation-induced microcontusions.	0.8463645874408245
The beginning of the cavity wall enhancement needs at least 10-15 min.	0.9840653797183019
MRI-controlled analysis of the intraoperative steps by the neurosurgeon and neuroradiologist allows discrimination of operation-induced reactions from tumor areas and leads to safe operation.	0.921860115681265
Angiosarcomas are very rare but highly malignant soft tissue tumors derived from the vascular endothelium.	0.9966446220539198
The tumor is most commonly found in the skin.	1.1457693710804722
The cancer is known to cause early and widespread metastases leading to a very poor prognosis of less than 24 months.	1.0375700058250386
The therapy of choice is radical surgery followed by adjuvant radiation.	0.8763283383084666
Background: Lipoprotein (a) is an important codominantly inherited risk factor for coronary disease but there is little data about its distribution in childhood.	1.2153739572513191
Despite the important role of lymph node infiltration for the classification and prognosis of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), no standards exist to evaluate the quality of mediastinal lymphadenectomy.	1.1765306377480864
Researches at several centers are not convinced that complete ipsilateral lymphadenectomy is necessary.	0.7556245757622299
We investigated 270 consecutive patients undergoing a potential curative operation for NSCLC including complete ipsilateral lymph node dissection in order to ascertain whether or not there is a correlation between tumor localization and lymph node infiltration.	1.0681179764996536
Patients were classified into the UICC (1987) stages I (n = 115), II (n = 42), and IIIa (n = 113).	1.347283407819756
In patients with N1-positive lymph nodes (n = 61) we found higher 5-year survival for patients with only intrapulmonary lymph node infiltration (39 %) than for patients with hilar infiltration (21 %).	1.1923192158223503
Patients with N2 disease showed skip metastases in up to 81 % of cases.	0.8957217402137391
We found that no tumor location predicted the lymph node infiltration.	0.9033622245647422
Due to the variability of lymph node infiltration and the frequently occurring skip metastases, complete ipsilateral lymphadenectomy should be the standard for curative operations for NSCLC.	1.0562188187044876
The muscles should be viewed as a response member in functional and structural disorders as well as in central control.	1.0920216573111234
This second part of the article will attempt to show not only that the muscles are representing an interesting and sensitive information pool for disorders in the motoric system, but also that lesions in specific leg and hip muscles have an effect on the pelvis and spine and even on scapular mobility.	1.0815305669055544
Purpose: The aim of the study was to apply laparoscopic techniques in reconstructive procedures for aortoiliac occlusive disease.	0.9965870000029587
Methods: From February 1996 to February 1998, 16 patients underwent a laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass procedure (ABF) using the transperitoneal approach.	1.1834183679573114
Six, 5 to 12 mm ports were needed to dissect, cross-clamp and divide the infrarenal aorta using specific laparoscopic devices.	0.9648734007644036
The aortic anastomosis was made end-to-side.	0.9477712530584615
A long curved clamp was then passed from each groin to draw the limbs of the graft into the femoral incision.	0.9639089940763825
The distal anastomosis was then performed conventionally.	0.7103227430475358
Results: The laparoscopic ABF was performed successfully in 13 of 16 cases.	1.1530360523599816
Three times a conversion to open surgery was requested.	0.8919682965911946
One patient developed respiratory insufficiency requiring prolonged treatment on the ICU.	0.9353623905170313
Mean operative time was 292 +/- 60 min; the aorta was crossclamped for 74 +/- 18 min.	1.0039672242558382
Two patients needed transfusions of red blood cells.	0.7994568071586646
In the study group, blood loss averaged 566 +/- 434 ml.	0.954587233030425
The bypass patency and the correct positioning of the graft were assessed by angiography.	0.9940266811024048
The patients were discharged 9 +/- 5.8 days after surgery.	1.026799955313267
At follow-up after 4.5 +/- 4 months, 15 patients were examined noninvasively in the vascular laboratory.	1.2727134079664408
All grafts were patent, and the ischemic symptoms had resolved in 14 patients.	1.152842691626597
One patient with recurrent claudication had severe stenosis of the left distal anastomosis.	1.1222178177469209
Conclusions: The laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass is a feasible, safe and effective procedure.	0.9843058074702116
Specific laparoscopic instruments are required for the challenging procedure.	0.7900418317790996
The development of vascular staplers and retraction devices will probably reduce the operative time and the technical challenge.	0.9652020346523746
In the future this operative technique may gain relevance as a minimally invasive procedure for severe aortoiliac occlusive disease.	1.0075531403065667
A 12 year old boy developed the complete symptom complex of Adamantiades-Behçet's disease over a two-year period.	1.0059322573347995
He presented with the mucocutaneous variant with recurrent to persistent oral ulcers which extended into the pharynx, recurrent genital ulcers, perianal lesions, and a positive pathergy test.	1.1099212189435959
Ocular involvement and other  symptoms associated with the disease were absent.	1.104024299125774
However, the early onset of the  disease and the male gender indicated a bad prognosis.	1.3402795848075393
The patients father deficiency of suffered from bronchial asthma with recurrent respiratory infections.	0.747045724451147
An IgG-3 subclass was detected.	0.6172447329452022
Lymphocyte transformation tests showed markedly diminished response to stimulation with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody in both patients, while response to PWM, CoA and PHA was normal.	0.8731996152367288
In addition, the concentration of serum soluble interleukin 6 receptor was reduced in both patients.	0.9678533757225607
A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the detection of dermatophytes was established.	0.6903931635835033
The primers "TR1" and "TR2" amplify a 581 bp fragment within the gene coding for the small ribosomal subunit (18S rRNA) of fungi.	1.000373558128081
PCR allowed the detection of isolates of 7 common dermatophytes and in addition several yeasts and moulds.	0.8776271680975924
Hybridisation with specific oligonucleotides results in the identification of dermatophytes and Candida albicans.	0.8223516512366406
Restriction analysis of the PCR product allowed us to distinguish between dermatophytes and yeasts or moulds.	0.8751698695544414
The specifity of the PCR with respect to fungi was assessed by testing human DNA collected from 42 dermis and epidermis specimens as well as DNA from selected plants and animals.	0.9319070967762789
To evaluate the clinical relevance of the PCR assay, 69 routinely collected skin and nail specimens were examined by PCR and culture.	1.0842013613290646
PCR detected dermatophytes in 35 and culture in 28 of 38 specimens that were classified as positive.	0.8931970715431253
Sensitivity of PCR (92%) was higher than that of culture (73%).	0.9479863722870956
These results show that PCR has advantages over culture for the detection of dermatophytes.	0.7618662084453706
Starting with the recommendations of the "Psychiatrie-Enquête", a current empirical stock-taking was undertaken about the structure of care in psychiatric hospital units.	0.966960985206434
319 treatment units (289 in Germany, 11 in Austria, and 19 in Switzerland) were investigated concerning size of the treatment unit, number of wards, centrality of admission, existence of large observation rooms ("Wachsäle"), spezialized wards, single sex wards, regionalization/sectorization, open-door wards, coercive measures, and intended structural changes.	1.1418465611968174
The return rate of questionnaires amounted 59%.	0.6414791764020374
The results show that the recommendations of the "Psychiatrie-Enquête" are mostly realized today, but not everywhere.	1.058414626833838
Across countries differences resulted in size of ward, centrality of admission, open-door wards, and coercive measures.	0.7541825001347626
Treatment units in the western and eastern parts of germany differed in size of ward and centrality of admission.	0.8532204524440488
Differences between psychiatric hospitals, psychiatric departments at general hospitals and psychiatric university hospitals were, though significant, smaller than expected in the light of past controversies.	1.0262437354891787
Intended structural changes mainly concerned open-door wards, internal sectorization, decentralization of admission, and mixing the sexes in single sex wards.	0.8356662125950518
Background: The ciliary sulcus as the intended location of transsclerally fixated posterior chamber lenses (PCL) is withdrawn from the surgeon's view.	1.0004555733175182
Using high-resolution ultrasound, we acquire pictures that postoperatively allow us to determine the position of the haptics.	0.9690440338577538
Many patients would like to resume some sport activities after total knee replacement; however, most recommendations are based on subjective opinion rather than scientific evidence.	1.0114698227686878
Background: Considering the high recurrence rate after conventional inguinal hernia repair, the totally preperitoneal endoscopic inguinal hernia repair has been used.	1.1378891297742584
Methods: The present experience of the authors embraces 1085 patients with a total of 1717 inguinal hernias, including 200 recurrences.	1.2207242040831068
The operative technique is described with emphasis on pitfalls and tricks.	0.9473468992718105
Results: Analysis of the data concerning the first 403 patients with 1 year complete follow-up reveals a mean (SEM) operating time of 42 (1.2) min for unilateral and 58 (1.0) min for bilateral hernia repair.	1.341355832287277
Mean (SEM) postoperative hospital stay was 2 (0.04) days.	0.9928145015618958
Complication rates during and after operation were 0.3 % and 3.3 % respectively.	1.2141325715673768
The morbidity rate at 1 month after operation was 3.5 %.	1.0515725031771614
The recurrence rate was 0.3 % at 1-year follow-up.	1.1140145086109097
Conclusion: Totally preperitoneal endoscopic inguinal hernia repair is safe and reproducible for any type of primary or recurrent inguinal hernia, even in patients with previous subumbilical surgery or severe systemic disease.	1.138131248295117
Careful follow-up is mandatory to assess the late recurrence rate.	0.9416403725260094
Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate prospectively whether there are differences in spectrometrically measurable parameters of the fundus between patients with early and late age-related maculopathy (ARM), the children of the ARM patients (F1 generation) and normals.	1.1902102225478715
In approximately 4-10 % of patients presenting with renal cell cancer the transluminal propagation of a tumor thrombus into the vena cava inferior or the right atrium comes to diagnosis.	1.0419149509539711
Recent investigations have indicated that the presence of neoplastic extension into the venous system does not reveal independent prognostic value regarding the clinical course of the disease.	0.9458484062787086
Although the complete surgical removal of vena cava thrombosis in patients without simultaneously occurring regional lymph node or distant metastases has become a well established treatment modality, several questions concerning this surgical strategy still remain the subject of ongoing discussions.	1.0974076033126636
In the present investigation that included 92 patients with renal cell cancer and intracaval neoplastic extension it was clearly demonstrated that the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest preferably during the removal of intracaval thrombosis extending into the right atrium does not result in a substantially increased treatment-related intra- or postoperative mortality.	1.1480497509421477
However, in contrast to a previously reported observation this treatment option did not reveal any substantial impact on the long-term survival of the patients following surgical therapy.	1.399514719477881
Accordingly, the cranial extension of intracaval thrombosis was not identified as a biological variable of any prognostic importance for renal cell cancer patients.	1.0660173720921569
Vascular surgery or penile prosthesis implantation are the main surgical options for erectile dysfunction.	0.8867036512149576
In this category, penile revascularization is the only causal therapy for selected patients: males younger than 50 years of age at time of surgery, maximum of two risk factors, exclusion of diabetes mellitus.	1.0408060658193452
Long-term success decreased to 53 % to 55 % in comparison to first encouraging reports of 80 % success.	1.465489506817886
Venous surgery resulted in an even more distinct decline of success the longer the elapse of time after surgery.	0.9120047279653422
Long-term success dropped under 40 %, leaving only a few indications for penile venous ligation.	1.3017375972133391
In contrast, penile prosthesis implantation results in high satisfaction rates.	0.9722390099703417
Despite this, it is not generally recommended as first choice surgical management as it is linked to irreversible damage of the cavernosal bodies.	1.0632714874319797
Among numerous types of penile implants, preference is nowadays mostly given to the three-piece hydraulic models.	0.8961853088051269
However, such complications as defective or perforated cylinders in up to 35 % after 5 years have arisen, depending on the type of implant.	1.3338525208868504
In a selected patient group, vacuum constriction devices with a mean patient acceptance of 75 % (50 % to 90 %) seldom result in complications and are thus considered to be a well-established therapeutical option.	1.229877273285605
It has been suggested that anhedonia, the loss of pleasure, is associated with a dysfunction of the dopaminergic reward system in schizophrenic and alcohol-dependent patients.	0.9448890727196411
In a series of neuroendocrinological and brain imaging studies, we examined pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms of dopaminergic neurotransmission in non-human primates and in schizophrenic and alcohol-dependent patients.	0.8773315455814186
Among alcoholics, we found indicators of a sensitization of dopaminergic neurotransmission, which was associated with the relapse risk, but not with anhedonia or depression.	1.274533649703211
Schizophrenics with neuroleptic blockade of striatal dopamine D2 receptors displayed psychomotor slowing and reduced motivation, but not anhedonia.	0.9801174102862689
Primate studies pointed to the importance of a temporo-cortical dysfunction in the pathogenesis of phasic dopaminergic dysregulation in the striatum.	0.8636735414343346
These observations indicate that a dysfunction of stimulus-dependent dopamine release may be associated with motivational deficits caused by a reduction in incentive salience, but not with anhedonia.	1.0236835743296553
Any operation for lung cancer that is planned as curative includes dissection of the lymph nodes in the mediastinum in order to allow correct staging of the disease.	0.9983066394173399
It is well known that ipsilateral lymph node metastases (N2) mean a poor prognosis.	0.7910153241418997
Since most patients with this finding die from metastatic tumor progression within 3 years after the operation, it can be assumed that positive findings in the mediastinal lymph nodes represent generalization of the cancer.	1.1081593718786926
Therefore, the probability of a therapeutic effect from more radical removal of lymph nodes in the mediastinum is rather low.	1.0520201174401727
On the other hand, it is justified to apply and evaluate additional systemic treatment in these tumor stages.	1.07336577109505
In analogy with high-dose contrast-enhanced CT, there have been a few studies during recent years that have dealt with high-dose paramagnetic contrast dyes in MRI.	1.2115810647369436
One reason for these studies was the development of new and low-osmolar contrast agents in the MR field.	1.207946546389282
Depending on the clinical problem, a high-dose contrast study in MRI is rarely indicated: (1) in metastatic disease, MR imaging with high-dose contrast material is indicated when the standard dose study is negative or only shows a solitary cerebral lesion or a number of lesions just suitable for radiosurgery; (2) in patients with malignant glioma the high-dose study allows better definition of the tumor margins.	1.3180598196027544
If a radical surgical approach is planned, the diagnostic potential should be fully used; if only a biopsy or subtotal debulking is planned, a standard dose study is enough.	1.1364707416760416
(3) in patients with MS, a high-dose study is only recommended within therapeutic trials in which the number of active plaques is a primary variable.	1.2123256850276
The basic idea of the Collaborative Family Health Care is nothing new.	0.793734874864507
It has its roots in the bio-psycho-social model of medicine developed by George Engel in the U.S.A. and it has a long tradition in the German psychosomatic medicine.	1.0975659560693258
At a time of basic changes in our health care system caused by cost considerations owing to the cutting back of resources it is important to note, that Collaborative Family Health Care combines aspects of theoretical models and pragmatic action-orientation.	1.0069109477969815
The basic is a systemic view of illness and health.	0.8055121842474684
The doctor-patient-dyad is in this view enlarged to a treatment-triad composed of the therapist, the patient and his family, to be able to bundle the whole potential at disposal, i.e.	1.0976391232228428
the treatment motivation of the patient, the support of the family and the expertize of the therapist.	1.0686313986464058
A lot of studies support the resource- saving potential of coopertive methods.	0.7672946570493174
However, their realization is not possible without considerable learning processes of physicians, psychotherapists and other  professionals.	1.225342594967899
A potential has to be mobilized, which affects by no means only the costs.	0.9922463553919163
The Collaborative Family Health Care offers new challenges to the professional culture of psychotherapists and new chances for influencing the world of medical health care.	0.9020538548246004
At a time of obviously reduced professional solidarity, the iniitiatives of CFHC offer a possibility for physicians, patients and their relatives to reach contentment through cooperation.	1.0728778721543786
Interested colleagues are invited to collaborate in the German Section of the CFHC.	0.9082410963440992
We evaluated the short- to mid-term results of an unconstrained total ankle prosthesis (S. T. A. R.) with uncemented fixation.	1.257144249040214
Fifty consecutive ankle replacements were performed in 48 patients between 1996 and 1999.	0.8682051734041404
The initial diagnosis was posttraumatic osteoarthrosis in 31 cases (62 %), primary osteoarthrosis in 8 cases (16 %), and systemic joint affection in 11 cases (22 %), e. g. rheumatoid arthritis (6 cases), hemochromatosis (2 cases), psoriasis arthritis (1 case), lupus erythematodes (1 case), and sclerodermia (1 case).	1.2559608955158756
There were two perioperative complications: one superficial wound dehiscence that healed uneventfully, and one injury to the dorsal foot artery that necessitated primary reconstruction.	1.0713668528498852
Seven revisions, all in cases of posttraumatic arthrosis, were necessary: local revision of the fibula for painful lateral impingement (3 cases), posteromedial soft tissue revision for painful restriction of dorsiflexion (2 cases), percutaneous lengthening of the Achilles tendon (1 case), and osteotomy and callus distraction for angular correction after stress fracture of the distal tibia (1 case).	1.2407595083784393
At the last follow-up control, 21 patients (62 %) were very satisfied, 10 patients (29 %) were satisfied, and 3 patients (9 %) were satisfied with reservations.	1.4520960687426632
The obtained range of motion was 30  ° (range, 15 to 55  °), with a maximal plantarflexion of 25  ° (range, 15 to 45  °) and dorsiflexion of 5  ° (-3 to 20  °).	1.3035605665110344
When the AOFAS-Hindfoot-Score was applied, the 34 patients scored 84.1 points (range, 44 to 100 points).	0.9660353291850455
After settling of the implants within 6 weeks, no migration was noted in any case, and all implants were considered to be stable.	1.2754767306771522
The favorable results were considered to be a result of the mechanical properties of the S. T. A. R. total ankle prosthesis that allows for unconstrained motion of the polyethylene inlay on the tibial component, e. g. anteroposterior translation, mediolateral translation and axial rotation.	1.020864668111435
The success of implantation may depend on exact technique, correct hindfoot alignement, sufficient capsuloligamentous stability of the ankle, and a solid bone stock.	1.3129201919647993
Although our first results are very encouraging, a longer follow-up is mandatory to answer the question whether ankle replacement is a viable alternative to ankle arthrodesis.	1.071948384606187
In a prospective study, the influence of the status of the peri-implant hard and soft tissues on the success of enosseous dental implants in tumor patients was assessed.	1.005020904060309
Out of 59 tumor patients with 261 implants, treated between July 1988 and August 1996, a pool of 23 patients with 99 implants provided with dentures for at least 1 year was obtained.	1.0200137887550158
Eighteen of these patients suffered from a squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity.	0.9483252346665527
Seventeen patients underwent preoperative radiation (40 Gy).	0.8963802915165036
A total of 68 out of 99 implants were inserted into autologous bone transplanted to reconstruct the mandible.	0.9042235687149841
In order to assess the peri-implant hard and soft tissues, the Hygiene Index, the Sulcus Bleeding Index, the Gingiva Index, the pocket-probing depth, the peri-implant bone resorption, and the periotest were used.	1.1194890352341602
The results in the tumor patients were compared with the results in a pool of nontumor patients.	1.4653207518270628
Tumor patients had significantly worse peri-implant parameters than nontumor patients.	0.8725833384649787
The peri-implant pocket-probing depth proved to have significant influence on the success rate.	0.9835631174406265
The overall success rate was 77.8%.	0.7262374145092514
Many articles in the literature document the fact that postoperative pain therapy has not improved for decades despite new insights into pain physiology, the availability of powerful analgesics and the development of new techniques.	1.105612944811479
This project was set up to develop practical, effective, safe, and easy to run acute pain therapy.	1.0612933543521423
A 26-year-old man sustained a C2 arc fracture.	0.9304157283967556
Ventral spondylodesis using an H-plate was performed.	0.78357658136733
The patient developed a pharyngovertebral fistula which remained undetected for 1 year.	0.7645010579768564
Spontaneous fusion of C3/C4 and osteolysis of the cortical block occurred.	0.7418150743288645
The fistula was demonstrated intraoperatively and the implant was transorally removed.	1.0138951936604588
No further problems occurred after this unusual method of treatment.	0.8550296680125441
The anatomy of the cervical spine, special problems of intensive care patients and the use of proper instrumentation are discussed.	1.0193109469945758
An interscalene block of the brachial plexus was combined with general anaesthesia for repair of a complex chronic lesion of the shoulder.	1.018843577450278
The localisation of the plexus with electro-stimulation and the injection of Bupivacain 0.5% were accomplished easily and without painful sensations.	1.0900470989038287
48 hours later the block was still partially present.	0.8083818824166563
Paraesthesia and a sensory and motor innervation deficit affected mainly the dorsal fascicle, but also areas innervated by the median and lateral fascicles.	1.044968605353952
The deficit did not completely disappear for 18 month.	0.699025429490719
The cause could have been due to direct traumatisation during blockade or operation, toxic action of the injected substance (Bupivacain 0,5%, 30 ml), distension of the plexus, a cervical syndrome or an aseptic plexitis, although a definite determination is not possible.	1.2639365042296942
However, the pattern of the lesion and the lack of pain during localisation of the plexus and injection favour traumatisation during the acromioplasty.	1.1019148920173039
Microfilm photography allows documentation of naevi in a map-like fashion.	0.7959425736955578
The localization of multiple naevi is no longer a problem, as one can scan the film.	1.0700525554376414
Comparison of the magnified film with the patient can be done in day-light.	1.0586734672960396
Magnification up to 48 times is possible.	0.6810797275019185
Detection of early changes of the naevi, during the horizontal growth phase, should increase the 5-year survival rate.	1.1576513915087978
In the ancient times, Aristotle, Herophilos, and Galen discovered basic anatomical structures.	0.8551329426164953
Paul von Aegina, in the seventh century a. c., had the idea of a nerve suture, which was first performed in an animal 1000 years later by the Italian surgeon Gabriele Ferrara.	1.270134155081342
Systematic investigations on nerve crossing date to the beginning of the nineteenth century and were conducted by Jean Pierre Flourens.	0.899025809813615
Within 1 week in summer 1864, two French surgeons (Laugier and Nélaton) independently carried out the first nerve sutures in humans.	0.9100950788518903
Their observations of an immediate functional recovery of the appropriate muscles after suturing were discussed controversially in scientific circles.	0.9312652737016908

Aggressive angiomyxoma (AAM) is a tumor of the soft tissues predominantely occurring in the genital and pelvic area with a strong propensity to local recurrences.	1.0798006200662906
The entity was first described in 1983.	0.6939513966453885
The tumor is regarded as low-grade sarcoma by some authors; its cause and pathogenesis are presently unknown.	1.0531587033987664
This is a case report on a 27-year-old man who underwent 4 surgical procedures of the left lower extremity because of a recurrent soft tissue neoplasm, initially (August 1993) diagnosed as a myxolipoma.	1.2504983227222815
The patient suffered from recurrences in February 1995, September 1996 and February 1998.	0.7836261488692546
The diagnosis was revised at the time of the latest recurrence.	1.0502210178734053
A palliative resection with macroscopic residuals left was performed in February 1998, followed by a radiation therapy with 56 Gy total dose and a concomitant administration of the radiosensitizer razoxane per os.	0.9999323122037327
The single radiation doses were 200 cGy 5 times a week.	0.6817669813622046
The small residuals of the tumor obviously regressed although an objective response could not be shown because the lesion was not clearly measurable.	1.0931532368763206
A follow-up 2 years after the radiation treatment revealed no recurrence.	0.9820901077515575
The time of the local control achieved as yet is already longer than any former time to regrowth between the surgical procedures.	1.1000446171853435
This is, to our knowledge, the first description of a therapeutic irradiation of a recurrent aggressive angiomyxoma.	1.2185602387980567
Radiation therapy combined with the sensitizer razoxane is able to control a recurrent AAM for an unknown time.	0.8662074713274027
It remains open whether a radiation treatment alone would have had a similar effect.	0.888249385630786
Micronervereconstruction of motor and sensitive nerves in the head and neck area today has an established range of indications.	0.9635827243910529
Surgical procedures of external and internal neurolyses, nerve coaptation and nerve transplantation techniques are well standardized.	0.9228787285762029
With microneurosurgery of motor nerves, satisfying or good results can be generally obtained.	0.8224237210262988
Success rates exceeding 50% following sensitive nerve reconstructions justify the performance of the procedures, more so because of the subjective improvements for the individual patient.	1.0582996782325167
Perspectives can be seen in further simplification of surgical methods of harvesting nerve grafts, e.g., by development of minimally invasive, eventually endoscopically guided procedures.	1.0293476731136524
Allogenic nerve grafts may also be applied.	0.8152073681908949
Initial experiments with nerve distractions are encouraging.	0.6323236493174923
A better understanding of nerve lesions on cellular and molecular biological levels may improve our knowledge of posttraumatic regulatory procedures and may lead to future possibilities of nonsurgical treatment options for peripheral and central nerve lesions by guided regeneration.	0.989831468824994
Objective: The acceptance of fibromyalgia as a disease entity and its definitive diagnosis have been hampered by a dearth of knowledge concerning the underlying pathophysiology of this disease and the lack of specific biochemical markers applicable to its diagnosis.	1.0817842782050182
To determine whether abnormal collagen metabolism is a characteristic of fibromyalgia, we have analyzed collagen metabolites in the urine and serum of patients with fibromyalgia.	1.2240517656744034
Methods: The diagnosis of fibromyalgia was made according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria.	1.001753355926008
Urine and serum were collected under standardized conditions from 39 patients and 55 age- and sex-matched controls.	0.9562137200221744
Pyridinoline (Pyd) and deoxypyridinoline (Dpyd), which represent products of lysyl oxidase-mediated cross-linking in collagen and are indicators of connective tissue and bone degradation, respectively, were analyzed by ion-paired and gradient HPLC method with fluorescence detection (HPLC).	1.0840675851587618
Levels of hydroxypyroline (Hyp), a collagen turnover marker, were also measured.	1.1953818120307216
The findings were related to creatinine levels and the Pyd/Dpyd ratio determined.	0.8212285879673904
The Pyd/Dpyd ratios in the urine and serum and the Hyp in the urine were significantly lower in patients with fibromyalgia than in healthy controls.	1.0141243853280597
Conclusion: Decreased levels of collagen cross-linking may contribute to remodeling of the extracellular matrix and collagen deposition around the nerve fibers in fibromyalgia and contribute to the lower pain threshold at the tender points.	1.040871979118045
Analysis of altered collagen metabolism either by histologic examination on biopsy or, preferably, by HPLC analysis of collagen metabolites in urine or serum may aid to understand more about the pathogenesis of fibromyalgia.	1.021147834417038
Background: The dynamic radionuclide nephrography (Tc99m-MAG3) is an important method in the evaluation of obstruction of the upper urinary tract.	1.1586356261854307
The aim of the present study was to assess whether radionuclid nephrography under standardized conditions with adequate hydration and Furosemid induced diuresis can reliably detect a significant obstruction at the pelvi-ureteric junction.	0.9349297471472102
We therefore tested whether minimal tracer washout (10-25%) in the presence of normal renal function could justity a non-operative managment.	1.1529782006834988
The lateral decubitus position is the standard position for nephrectomies.	0.9632966321733331
There is a lack of data about the effects of this extreme position upon respiratory mechanics and gas exchange.	0.8738842118622401
In 20 patients undergoing surgery in the nephrectomy position, we compared a new closed-loop-controlled ventilation algorithm, adaptive lung ventilation (ALV), which adapts the breathing pattern automatically, to the respiratory mechanics with conventionally controlled mandatory ventilation (CMV).	1.1790256696202492
The aims of our study were (1) to describe positioning effects on respiratory mechanics and gas exchange, (2) to compary ventilatory parameters selected by the ALV controller with traditional settings of CMV, and (3) to assess the individual adaptation of the ventilatory parameters by the ALV controller.	1.1252014766151548
The respirator used was a modified Amadeus ventilator, which is controlled by an external computer and possesses an integrated lung function analyzer.	1.08602501643554
In a first set of measurements, we compared parameters of respiratory mechanics and gas exchange in the horizontal supine position and 20 min after changing to the nephrectomy position.	1.1141788858263502
In a second set of measurements, patients were ventilated with ALV and CMV using a randomized crossover design.	1.0283136828911557
The CMV settings were a tidal volume of 10 ml/kg body weight, a respiratory rate of 10 breaths/min, an I:E ratio of 1:1.5, and an end-inspiratory pause of 30% of inspiratory time.	1.248255182031795
With both ventilation modes FiO2 was set to 0.5 and PEEP to 3 cm H2O.	1.0732655993914841
During ALV a desired alveolar ventilation of 70 ml/kg KG - min was preset.	1.111664382327354
All other ventilatory parameters were determined by the ALV controller according to the instantaneously measured respiratory parameters.	0.9667252181111459
Positioning induced a reduction of compliance from 61.6 to 47.9 ml/cm H2O; the respiratory time constant shortened from 1.2 to 1.08 s, whereas physiological dead space increased from 158.9 to 207.5 ml.	1.239169350530779
On average, the ventilatory parameters selected by the ALV controller resembled very closely those used with CMV.	0.8099151447816659
However, an adaptation to individual respiratory mechanics was clearly evident with ALV.	1.1785930535952334
In conclusion, we found that the effects of positioning for nephrectomy are minor and may give rise to problems only in patients with restrictive lung disease.	1.1675808094657114
The novel ALV controller automatically selects ventilatory parameters that are clinically sound and are better adapted to the respiratory mechanics of ventilated patients than the standardized settings of CMV are.	0.9100423939482157
Noma is an ulcerative-necrotizing gingivo-stomatitis eventually leading to severe destruction of the midface, including lips and cheek, maxilla/mandible, nose and rarely the orbit.	0.9189553923947018
The defects are usually unilateral.	0.6186599049675822
Children from economically underdeveloped countries are predominantly affected.	0.6169882233259517
Medically untreated the disease has a high mortality rate, which can be dramatically lowered by adequate antibiotic therapy started in time.	1.0828587091983646
Predisposing factors include malnourishment, immunosuppression, and poor oral hygiene.	0.951373960243716
Forty-eight noma patients were surgically treated in Sokoto, Nigeria during October 1997 by an Interplast Germany team sponsored by AWD Stiftung Kinderhilfe.	0.8093123544845545
Interdisciplinary surgical strategies and results, e. g. ankylosis release, local flap coverage and 12 pedicled musculocutaneous latissimus dorsi island flaps, as well as a noma classification (NOMAC), are presented.	1.060243284168695
During a period of 3 years, four controled clinical studies in 34 patients with hypercholesterolaemia and 40 healthy persons - in some cases with stratification of the basic cholesterol levels and matched pair formation - were performed to find out the effects of serial sun-like UV irradiation on various serum parameters and blood circulation functions.	1.2490142350597493
The following significant effects were observed.	0.576715233516217
Patients with hypercholesterolaemia: increase of HDL cholesterol after termination of the serial UV irradiation, increase of serum 25 (OH)D3 levels, decrease of serum triiodothyronine, decrease of serum lactate; healthy persons: decrease of resting pulse rate, decrease of recovery pulse rate, decrease of systolic blood pressure.	0.9833199967608502
All effects were induced by application of suberythematous UV doses, i.e.	0.6510675415927457
amounts of UV with a relatively low risk of side effects.	0.8439649312363602
In 1998 Minor et al.	0.5040904156206631
described a new variant of perilymphatic fistula: the "superior canal dehiscence syndrome".	0.8383010329420306
This syndrome is clinically characterized by recurrent attacks of vertigo and oscillopsia induced by loud noises or stimuli that result in changes in intracranial or middle ear pressure.	0.8309326404009738
It is caused by a dehiscence of bone overlying the superior (anterior) semicircular canal.	0.863574142160161
Due to this dehiscence, a third, mobile window (in addition to the round and oval windows) is formed, and changes in pressure are pathologically transduced to the anterior semicircular canal.	1.175247702341724
In the present study we evaluated proprioceptive capabilities of the knee joint with a balance test and correlated these findings to parameters which document mechanical stability.	1.0664734019858224
We compared 8 conservatively treated and 12 surgically treated patients with ACL-deficient knee joints with a control group of 12 subjects.	1.0290929680775334
The balance test was performed with a Kistler force plate.	0.8803839187120324
Both the conservatively treated and the surgically treated patients showed significantly higher deviations of their centre of gravity than the control group.	0.9685254055237048
This was true not only for the injured leg but also for the noninjured contralateral leg.	1.0034941078481898
The differences were most remarkable when comparing the entire distance of centre of gravity deviations during 10 s. Additionally, the conservatively treated patients interrupted the test procedure significantly more frequently than the other two groups.	1.0337321435015885
We were not able to document any correlation between proprioceptive function and parameters for joint stability such as anterior drawer, Lachman, pivot shift and KT-1000 measurements.	0.8096087452469707
The study examined the validity of psychometric measures for the assessment of driving ability in brain-damaged subjects.	0.8773571086670356
116 patients with brain damage mainly of vascular and traumatic origin underwent  extensive neuropsychological examinations emphasizing attentional performance and visual perceptual speed and participated in a comprehensive on-road driving test.	0.9570946858180339
Only 58% of the patients passed the driving test.	0.9812426612235369
Attempts to predict the outcome of the driving test by discriminant analysis or cut-off procedures based on neuropsychological and/or other subject-related data yielded a maximum of 73% correct predictions.	0.973757303087231
In view of the frequent impairment in driving ability after brain damage and in view of the failure to reliably predict driving ability from psychometric test results, it is recommended that in each case an on-road driving test is given.	1.047463351004693
In the planning of laser surgery for ENT operations, the specialist is often consulted by the anesthesiologist to predict possible intubation problems.	0.9998373307407183
Intubation problems in such operations can occur frequently due to the pathological findings present in the upper aerodigestive tract and the different constructions of laser-resistant endotracheal tubes.	1.0973488796475623
The aim of this study was to determine if a known predictive parameter could have a sufficient sensitivity and specificity to reliably predict possible intubation problems for ENT-related laser surgery.	0.962219470430065
In a prospective study, 91 patients were included and the Mallampati-score modified by Samsoon and Young was analyzed and compared to a score describing the actual conditions of intubation.	1.0590391375685995
The results showed a significant correlation (p <0.05, Chi-Square test).	1.1801934676234214
However, the specificity was only 72% and the sensitivity of 60% was too low to be of practical use.	1.3752478506341566
The results were independent of the endotracheal tube used.	1.0176667030728954
Although use of the laser for ENT operations provides a special situation for the anesthesiologist, there is still no system that is sensitive and specific enough to be of practical use.	1.1536513537561361
This problem is demonstrated in a literature  review.	0.9546080566574062
The treatment of patients with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism with contraindications for a thrombolytic therapy is a therapeutic challenge.	1.1101293822674656
We report on a 12 year old patient who was treated for large cell lymphoma according to NHL-BFM 95: Block AA protocol.	1.1130649915866182
During his therapy, he developed a thrombosis of his right femoral vein and pulmonary embolism affecting the left segments 4, 5, 8, and 9.	1.1516962970588995
Because of cerebral metastasis a fibrinolytic therapy was contraindicated.	0.7170651495288419
Therefore, we performed a mechanical thrombectomy using the Amplatz thrombectomy device.	1.0837838586715018
The postinterventional scintigraphy showed a markedly improved pulmonary perfusion; dopplersonography 4 months postinterventionally showed a patent right femoral vein.	0.7922165386657373
Within this chapter, tumors which produce bone matrix (osteoid) or other bone-forming tissues, like cartilage, connective tissue, and cementum or originate within the bone marrow are described.	1.051912053085736
In addition, those lesions are mentioned which, according to the WHO, are typical for the jawbones and are therefore included within the 1992 WHO classification of odontogenic tumors.	1.1847707794499571
Vascular and epithelial tumors which may also be observed in the jaws are not described.	1.004944458119267
All the lesions and tumors reported have in common a more or less similar clinical and radiological appearance.	0.9264808992908907
A precise diagnosis, therefore, can only be established by a sufficient biopsy which should be seen by a pathologist with experience in this field.	1.0326517260573942
In addition to clinical, radiological, and histological appearances, therapeutic necessities are described.	1.1370146695575378
The data from recent publications are taken into account.	0.8403779083725997
This presentation is based on the data collected within the reference registry of the German-Austrian-Swiss Study Group of Tumors of the Face and Jaws (DÖSAK) in Basel.	1.1821861339555804
Between 1987 and 1996 302 patients were treated for colorectal liver metastases.	1.0349080937538326
Out of this pool 252 completely documented cases were analysed.	0.7562499967704066
Forty-five patients (18 %) of this population were 70 years or older at time of admission.	1.2627320202112
In this population 17 major resections and 8 minor liver resections were performed.	0.8678862431999541
In 9 patients irresectable metastases were diagnosed during treatment of the primary tumor.	0.9416151059137804
In 3 cases laparotomy had to be finished as exploration.	0.8396433588675957
Eight patients were treated without surgery.	0.9197054710464625
Mortality after liver resection was 4 %, morbidity 28 %.	1.1357980891660004
The 5-year-survival-rate (Kaplan-Meier) of the R0 resected patients (n = 21) was 44 %.	1.3138894450208582
Comparison between the elderly patients and the younger population shows no significant differences in type and extent of treatment or in stage of disease.	1.1380463843433402
Survival, morbidity and mortality after liver resection also show no significant differences.	1.1134179321281494
These results show that even in elderly patients liver resection for colorectal metastases can be performed efficently and with a curative intention.	1.0620221046232785
The clinical course of 12 patients with mushroom poisoning was evaluated in order to define the parameters considered to be relevant to the indication for liver transplantation.	1.1517750717175457
Eight patients recovered under conservative therapy; one patient died due to pre-existing, concomitant cardiopulmonary disease.	0.9402488936584393
In three patients transplantations had to be performed because of severe liver failure.	1.137048880792058
On admission, the transplanted patients had a decreased Quick's test score and factor V value (< 10 %).	0.8952344745445099
The peak of liver enzymes, serum bilirubin, serum creatinine, partial thromboplastin time and azotemia were not of any prognostic value.	1.1499934298968528
Main indications for liver transplantation were a very low initial Quick's test score and factor V value (both < 10 %) and their inadequate response under substitution therapy.	1.052020041104492
The development of encephalopathy and renal failure were further parameters indicating poor prognosis.	0.8499282099689135
During submaximal isotonic back extension loading (31 male persons) surface-EMG was measured using 16 monopolar-linked electrodes in the low back region (L 3-S 1).	1.0580649087614684
By means of modification of amplitude- and frequency parameters in the EMG-signal two subject groups (6 persons each) with the slightest and most severe muscle fatigue in the paraspinal region were defined.	1.2079542243940764
For the analysis of muscle coordination, the EMG signal on the basis of an amplitude estimate at the beginning and at the end of the load situation was compared.	1.1423231601991706
During the extension phase, the group with slight fatigability showed no different spatial pattern of myoelectrical activity at the end of investigation than at the beginning.	1.0673028833324034
In contrast to this, the pattern of myoelectrical activity changed during the endurance test in the group of persons with considerable fatigability.	1.0442139790643965
Therefore, in addition to the muscular fatigue also the loss of muscle coordination has to be taken into account in the assessment of spinal function.	1.1927881050940812
Background: A fractional flow reserve (FFRmyo) <0.75 is a well validated parameter for significance of coronary stenoses in cases of normal myocardial function.	1.478132733367747
We used the FFRmyo limit in patients with impaired myocardial perfusion by myocardial infarction and/or hypertension for intermediate stenoses of the LAD for decision to PTCA and checked the indication by clinical follow-up.	0.9971769072219993
Distraction osteogenesis of the mandible is one treatment option in mandibular hypoplasia.	0.96065291174
Usually, a non-continuous distraction mode is applied.	1.15169447943902
The aim of the present study was to establish continuous bone distraction using a microhydraulic cylinder.	1.0298168562100098
Using a submandibular approach, the mandible was dissected subperiostally on one side in four mini-pigs; corticotomy was performed and the microhydraulic cylinder fixed with two bicortical screws.	1.0194345142836274
The hydraulic tube was connected with an automatic hydropneumatic injector system.	0.7435438321822568
Following 7 days at rest, a continuous distraction of 1.5 mm per day was performed for 14 days.	1.3352379283195572
After 2 and 4 weeks postoperatively, the animals were killed and X-rays taken.	1.2446168400228892
The mandible was then removed en bloc and microscopic evaluation of the sections was performed.	0.9066524582431301
The microhydraulic cylinder was easy to apply and to handle.	0.7180671331275932
The continuous stimulus did induce direct mineralisation of longitudinal oriented collagenous fibre bundles.	0.6934241866432084
Bony regeneration seems to be accelerated, which might reduce the postoperatively stabilizing phase.	1.081751083760663
The duration of spinal anaesthesia in infants is short compared to adult patients.	0.8429863539646104
When tetracaine is used, the addition of epinephrine significantly prolongs the duration.	0.8297264223528392
For bupivacaine, however, the influence of epinephrine on the duration is not clear.	0.9895102032022347
We investigated the effects of epinephrine 1: 200 000 added to bupivacaine 0.5% on duration and haemodynamics.	0.9946495567381927
Ten former pre-term infants with postnatal respiratory problems, scheduled for bilateral inguinal hernia repair, were enrolled in the study after informed parental consent had been obtained.	1.0292518127545587
The infants were fasted at least 4 h prior to surgery.	0.6694766231887427
If they did not receive i.v.	0.6034373261343805
infusions before surgery, a bolus of 10 ml/kg Ringer's acetate was injected after inserting the i.v.	0.8838400953194995
cannula, followed by a continuous infusion of 8 ml/kg 2/3 N NaCl with 5% dextrose.	1.0976788047465327
Spinal anaesthesia was performed in a sitting position with 0.6 ml bupivacaine 0.5%.	1.150642419109633
Five patients received plain bupivacaine (group I) and five bupivacaine with epinephrine 1: 200 000 (group II).	1.1070551861208517
Heart rate registered by ECG and non-invasive blood pressure were recorded prior to positioning the baby for lumbar puncture and 2, 5, 10, and 20 min after injection of bupivacaine.	1.0131805592820515
The duration of spinal anaesthesia was defined as the time from injection to the time when the first movements of the legs were observed after stimulation.	1.241896648086973
For testing statistical differences the U test was used between the groups and the Wilcoxon and Wilcox test within the groups.	0.9315006133212802
Results (expressed as median and range).	0.716824590986695
Additional epinephrine significantly prolonged the duration of spinal anaesthesia (group II: 95 min [60 - 120] vs group I: 50 min [37 - 85]).	1.1836814991602325
Haemodynamic parameters did not differ at any time between or within the groups.	0.8609008045311946
In group I, one infant had high spinal anaesthesia with impaired respiration but without cardiovascular effects; after 10 min of assisted ventilation by mask, sufficient respiration as judged by pulse oximetry and clinical observation had returned.	1.0252017849242128
The duration of spinal anaesthesia in this child was 60 min.	0.8735865540221326
Epinephrine 1: 200 000 significantly prolongs the duration of spinal anaesthesia in former preterm infants.	0.7880118617225911
Haemodynamic parameters in this age group remain unchanged during spinal anaesthesia and are not influenced by the addition of epinephrine.	0.9332793297902956
Purpose: Debate about the potential implementation of Spiral-CT in diagnostic algorithms of pulmonary embolism are often focussed on sensitivity and specificity in the context of comparative methodologic studies.	1.118302838294108
We intend to investigate whether additional factors might influence this debate.	0.9027537811598855
Familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) should be an "evidence-based" diagnosis derived from clinical and echocardiographic screening of informed and consenting relatives of index patients, and on the examination of clinical reports for deceased relatives.	0.9944649385948999
Most familial dilated cardiomyopathy pedigrees show an autosomal pattern of inheritance.	0.7649772076463778
Very few of them are X-linked and matrilinear.	0.9241610788596809
Autosomal recessive inheritance is difficult to be assessed in an evidence-based setting.	0.9892831331447921
By linkage analysis, several loci, but no disease gene, have been identified.	1.246866478465236
At present, few cases of familial dilated cardiomyopathy can benefit of a molecular diagnosis.	0.8652633445943525
As the results of the structural reform policy regulating the health care sector, the paper presents the possible path of increasing intrasectoral risk selection and intersectoral risk externalization (especially between the law of health care insurance, the law of statutory nursing inusrance, and the German poverty law).	1.2411740751806968
Particularly the new developments in the hospital sector will be analzyed regarding the dynamics of risk selection and risk externalization.	1.0275646719941196
The new economic ways of financing the hospital sector are inducing the need of systematic integration of the different branches of social law, especially more developed networks of the health care, the nursing system, and the social care services.	1.2924383139051985
Purpose: The inactive form of pyruvatekinase could be established in different tumours.	1.0149032779513627
Purpose of this study was to demonstate the presence or absence of the inactive form of pyruvatekinase in renal cell carcinoma, metastases and benign renal tissue by immunohistology.	0.9584981629763559
Introduction: The hemodynamic parameters of 95 patients undergoing maxillary or bimaxillary orthognathic surgery in 1996 and 1997 at the Department of OMF Surgery/Plastic Surgery, Krefeld, Germany, were analyzed retrospectivly to study the effect of intraoperative blood loss.	1.0090484130439468
Materials and methods: The parameters included the blood loss volume, age, weight and sex of the patients, the mode of osteotomy and the operation time, the surgeon, the average blood pressure, the infusion volume, the anesthesiologist, the thrombocyte counts and their function, the activity of the coagulation factors II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII and von-Willebrand-factor, and the pathological coagulation factor counts of each patient, the rate of autologous blood donation and the rate of retransfusion.	1.1985956201556005
Statistical analysis was done using the Speraman-Rho-test.	0.855330981120601
Results: The average blood loss during maxillary osteotomy was 670  +/-  380 ml and during bimaxillary surgery 1120  +/-  510 ml.	1.0741222774683548
Men lost about 300 ml more than women.	0.66076330581213
Operations of more than 3.5 h in length led to a blood loss of 1200  +/-  520 ml as opposed to 670  +/-  310 ml.	1.0737047822373185
The average blood loss among various surgeons was between 670 ml and 1180 ml of various anesthesiologists between 730 ml and 1200 ml, without statistical evidence.	0.9436156488547195
Some 17.9% of patients showed pathological thrombocytic function concerning medication with aspirin; 34.7% had pathological activities of coagulation factors, but only 2.1% with clinical significance.	1.4079625938296927
Conclusion: Mode of operation, maxillary or bimaxillary, und length of operation were the most significant factors of intraoperative blood loss.	1.1629825996121177
Patients with pathological coagulation had nearly the same rate of blood loss as patients with physiological coagulation.	0.8907391292722168
In most cases this was determined by restriction of aspirin.	0.9158019068373278
Analysis of the rate of autologous blood retransfusion showed a significant correlation to blood loss in bimaxillary surgery.	1.0376847036986991
Maxillary osteotomy led to a retransfusion of only 14.2% of autologous blood unit.	1.1082824717441069
This should be reviewed critically especially concerning costs.	0.8840225114081048
Purpose: Course and pathophysiology of a typical syndrome after irradiation of the cauda equina were studied.	1.2087162123997852
Wells' syndrome (eosinophilic cellulitis) is a rare inflammatory skin disease of unknown etiology and pathogenesis.	1.0284919019750312
Only 18 cases in childhood have been reported.	0.8322352655017231
We report on a 5-year-old girl who showed the typical biphasic and recurrent course of the disease: initially edematous-cellulitic lesions associated with blisters, followed by morphea-like changes on the extremities.	1.127883025043678
Eosinophilia of peripheral blood was apparent, which, however, was not correlated with the severity of the current condition.	1.3639392666793606
After a recurrent course for 4 months and intermittent systemic administration of antibiotics (on the assumption of erysipelas and phlegmon) and glucocorticosteroids, the disease healed without sequelae.	1.2294855515844438
Trigger factors or systemic hematologic malignancy could not be detected.	0.688903943845819
Diskussion: Wells' syndrome is probably more common than believed and should be included in the differential diagnosis of urticarial, morphea-like and bullous eruptions in childhood.	0.8746362460318728
In 1996, several employees of the French governmental organization for Blood Collection and Transfusions (CNTS) have been condemned by ordinary courts.	0.9994680063328711
They were found guilty in the affair on HIV-infected blood transfusions.	0.8514214076190749
Over 3800 persons, mostly hemophiliacs, have been infected in France and suffer from HIV disease.	1.0084945550253694
Many of them died already.	0.8319982163386301
The public in France urgently demanded the condemnation of the persons who were politically responsible for the time delay that postponed the introduction of HIV-tests for blood donations in France.	0.9303058056036898
Such a test was available from the american company ABBOTT in the early 1985, but the french authorities preferred to wait for the HIV-Test from Pasteur-Diagnostics.	1.1545480691195238
A special court, the "Court de Justice de la République", authorized to judge on members of  the governement, has been created by the French Parliament on Nov. 23, 1993.	1.0728644324528074
Six years later, the three politicians, the former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius, the minister for  Social Affairs, Mme Georgina Dufoix, and  her undersecretary of state for health, Mr.  Edmond Hervé, have been accused of involuntary homicide.	1.1272294193574068
March, 9, 1999, after five weeks of deliberations and statements, the CJR rendered his sentence: The former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius and the Minister  G. Dufoix were discharged, but the secretary of state for health, Edmond Hervé, has been declared guilty.	1.0495204082593292
However, also Mr. Hervé could leave the court room as a free person, because the President of the Court, Mr. Christian Le Gunehec, didn't want to pronounce a judgement against him, as Mr. Hervé had to suffer from almost 15 years of public  critics and attacks before he was found guilty.	1.0976254939139483
The hemophiliacs and other AIDS-patients as well as their families protested loudly against this judgement.	0.9087476396550314
They plan to file charges against the three ministers through a common court to hold them responsible.	0.7752607057752693
Classical insight therapy, derived from Freud, and `maternal' holding therapy, derived from Balint, Winnicott and others, are two contrasting treatment techniques in psychoanalysis.	0.9389222829466733
The authors believe that each of these two techniques presupposes specific philosophical basic assumptions about the nature of human beings.	1.041186619706409
The position of Freud is that of the basically traumatic character of human experience.	0.939770359322637
The contra-position of the object relation psychologists stipulates the priority of love in human experience.	0.7350877531593274
These assumptions seem to be more latent than overt guidelines of therapeutical techniques and therefore their reconstruction and reformulation have important implications for psychoanalytical therapy.	0.9166737349681997
Univentricular hearts represent rare complex cardial malformations.	0.5776027368728178
We report a case of a 34-year old male with single ventricle, two atria, tricuspid atresia, large atrial septal defect, complete transposition and pulmonary valvar stenosis.	1.215154136330621
There were no signs of chronic pulmonary hypertension.	0.8386116269793276
Intensive clinical analysis of the cardiac malformation was first performed at the age of five years.	1.0489508129762097
Conclusion was that the patient would have no benefit from operation.	0.9714821524985527
The patient had nearly normal live conditions with a profession, family and some sportive activities like squash.	0.9904067475382764
He died of sudden cardiac death.	0.5916800936542094
The malformation was examined by sequential segmental analysis and in comparison with the embryonic development.	1.0074674861415158
Clinical picture, prognosis and therapy are reported from literature.	0.965286370575547
During the last years development of cardiac surgery achieved good results.	1.0720044974642053
Special morphologic constellations, as in our case, may be the reason that conservative therapy can be sufficient for prolonged survival with good quality of life.	1.2054712327433255
The assessment and measurement of pain is essential in the implementation and control of pain relieving strategies.	1.1129590044266413
The measurement of pain in infants and children should be based on the consideration of age, cognitive level, psychological status, intercurrent diseases and the social context in order to register the child's individual situation and to avoid misinterpretation.	1.1225746721701078
From its origin to its death the human organism is submitted to functional, material and morphological changes that are perceptible.	0.9226511215734109
These changes permit classifying an individual as young, adult, old, active or infirm.	0.9439422151770434
But this estimation is not always correct.	0.89863320617284
Some appear younger, some older than expected from their chronological age.	0.991277317053967
But what is ageing and how can it be measured?	0.6953815619038273
For this, so-called markers or biological markers of ageing are used which are measurable indicators of ageing in live organisms.	0.9429852705419408
A description of the complexity, the asynchronous course and the biological variety and variability of biological age is less successful with a single indicator than with the inclusion of several markers in a multi-factorial measuring system, in a so-called test battery.	1.1378219027818297
Various test batteries have already been applied in numerous studies that consist of biochemical scans, mental and also social parameters in different combinations.	0.9544201738717424
A more precise description of such a test battery can be seen in the following discussion of the ILSE study.	1.202060699793581
The documentation form for pathohistologic findings (version III) for tumors of the maxillofacial region is presented.	0.9904499582285604
It is part of the site-specific documentation of the German Association of Tumor Centers (ADT).	1.020320239410309
Its handling is explained by instructions which are based on the ICD-O classification and the TNM system.	0.9258809297783366
The prognostic relevance of the standardized documentation has already been proven by various histomorphologic investigations concerning oral and oropharyngeal cancer.	0.7900947621494493
By means of a multicentric observational study the German Austrian Swiss co-operative group DÖSAK will develop a new prognostic model for oral and oropharyngeal cancer.	0.8937568759395799
The development of a middle ear cholesteatoma is usually associated with chronic inflammation and displacement of the mucosa present by the invading squamous epithelium.	1.0624782393372976
To analyze the clinically different behaviors of both epithelia, we used immunohistochemical methods to study the distribution and expression of interleukin-1 (Il-1), transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-), epidermal growth factor (EGF), epidermal growth factor-receptor (EGF-R), the proliferation marker MIB 1, c-myc proto-oncogene product and activation marker 4F2.	1.1480695266135754
Results stromal that keratinocytes in a cholesteatoma exhibited a much higher activation and proliferation rate when compared to middle ear mucosa cells.	0.9242648119380151
Middle ear epithelial cells showed no immunoreactivity for TGF-alpha, EGF-R, Il-1 and c-myc in contrast to the markedly positive immunoreactivity found in cholesteatoma matrix.	1.0140711948156287
The local release of cytokines and growth factors, such as TGF-alpha, EGF and Il-1 by inflammatory cells seems to be an important factor for the hyperproliferative behavior of cholesteatoma epithelium.	1.0774088356695097
Our findings could contribute to the pathogenesis of middle ear cholesteatoma and give a possible explanation for the sustained progression of its growth leading to displacement of the middle ear mucosa.	0.9736061119233009
The role of hip sonography in neonatal hip screening is still a controversial matter.	0.9336886019467606
This paper reports the results of the Austrian ultrasound hip screening program, in which all Austrian babies undergo hip sonography twice: at the birth clinic during the 1st week of life and at an age of 12-16 weeks.	1.234639716571233
Data from all public health insurance companies since 1985 and all ICD data about children hospitalized because of CDH in Austria were collected and analyzed.	0.8798614108149951
The rate of sonographically pathological hips was 6.57 % (1994).	1.0111327557862528
The treatment rate before introduction of hip sonography was 13.16 % (1985).	1.1372708154548843
The rate of open reduction went down to 0.24 per 1000 newborns, including a high number of unscreened children born abroad and also children with teratological dislocation of the hip.	1.0652204031801615
Hip sonography screening proved to be effective in detecting true instability of the hip joint as well as dysplasia.	0.9820437402087425
The optimal time for sonographic screening does not seem to be immediately after birth when only "high risk" hips (clinical instability, positive family history, breech delivery) should undergo hip sonography, but at an age between 4 and 6 weeks when the hip has already shown its true nature.	1.1134135130174343
Since one sonographic scan appears to be sufficient for screening, a further reduction of costs could be accomplished.	1.0912656718268452
Disability owing to DDH can be avoided in a number of cases, and costs for conservative and surgical treatment as well as for later endoprostheses and early retirement can be economized.	1.1693705232419465
Transactional analysis (Berne 1958) in its original concepts was intended to help even lay people to understand personal structures and psychodynamic processes.	0.9563769742324951
This intention lead some of the following authors to superficiality and a "happy-go-lucky" perspective.	0.9099397240706345
Others, most of all European transactional analysts went back to the roots of the original contents and aims and showed that they offer great clinical relevance for the understanding and treatment of a variety of disturbances.	1.1354291881690508
This article will illustrate these aspects, using the borderline syndrome as an example.	1.0327902341955344
The structural model of egostates serves to describe the borderline structure, concepts of the frame of reference and the script as patterns for the development and maintenance of the pathology, the concepts of transactions, games, symbioses and passivity as indicators for the stable instability of the relationships, and devaluations and grandiosities as examples of defence patterns.	1.0252014850573814
Practical ideas about the therapeutic contract as a basis of various working agreements, about methods of decreasing anxiety in therapeutic processes, and about contact and attachment as a substrate for corrective experiences, a healing atmosphere and dedramatisation of the process follow.	1.046341279471464
The article ends with transactional analytic considerations of transference, counter-transference and how to deal with regression processes.	0.7233045719161209
After separation of symblepharons in ocular pemphigoid, transplantation of nasal or bucal mucosa is recommended to prevent recurrent lid fusion; however, it is not always successful.	1.0485134108643324
The disturbance of generalized cheerfulness (serene-calmness disorder) is an illness, which is often recognised very late.	1.1580076449864218
It is characterised by a uniformity of psychic experience in the face of circumstances which would otherwise give cause for depressiveness, despair, great anxiety, self-accusations or aggression directed against others.	0.9292400107685043
Early diagnosis and specific therapy may decisively improve life-quality of the patients and may also prevent detrimental individual and social long-term consequences.	1.3372793917306836
Disturbances of microcirculation in coronary artery disease can be seen in the presence of critical stenosis of epicardial coronary arteries, as a result of endothelial dysfunction in the absence of significant stenosis or during recovery of ischaemic myocardium after successful angioplasty of stenosed or occluded coronary arteries.	1.0600198437242168
Diagnostic methods are morphologic/morphometric analyses, measurement of the global coronary reserve, measurement of the regional coronary microcirculation (scintigraphy, positron emission tomography) and laboratory analysis of haemorheological alterations (plasma, erythrocytes, leucocytes).	0.9058372783702174
After successful angioplasty, normalisation of glutamate extraction rate takes three to six months.	0.779340175378925
In patients with unstable angina, changes in plasma viscosity, erythrocyte aggregation and neutrophil activation occur.	0.8161441403229661
Neutrophils are activated after successful angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction and even after elective angioplasty (when measured in the coronary sinus).	1.0775003306643653
Therapeutic improvements of disturbed microvascular flow can be obtained by increasing perfusion pressure (by revascularisation, nitrates, calcium antagnoists, physical training), by improving the fluidity of the blood and by reducing the extravascular component of coronary vascular resistance (by antihypertensive treatment).	1.1771677693167992
Intracytoplasmic injection of sperm (ICSI) extracted from testicular tissue (TESE) represents the only possibility for men with non-obstructive azoospermia to father a child.	0.9225510352087332
ICSI is also the only treatment for men with obstructive azoospermia if microsurgery is not possible or not successful.	1.0509665190281905
However, approximately only every fifth treatment cycle leads to a pregnancy.	1.139497734581187
Thus, in most cases, several treatment cycles have to be performed to achieve a pregnancy and therefore testicular biopsies have to be taken several times.	1.3326892731498354
Cryopreservation of testicular tissue offers the possibility to store testicular tissue for several treatment cycles of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and to detach surgical sperm retrieval in the man and infertility treatment in the woman (ovarian stimulation, ovum pick-up, embryo transfer).	1.0643371309764171
For the man, cryopreservation offers the advantage that only one testicular biopsy has to be performed for diagnostic reasons and for sperm retrieval.	1.080370918743081
The advantage for the women is that infertility treatment is started only if testicular histology confirms spermatids, at least in the testicular tissue.	0.9924042402153679
The cumulative pregnancy rate of IVF/ICSI/TESE-cycles can be increased by cryopreservation of supernumerary pronuclear stage oocytes and embryo transfer after thawing in successive cycles.	0.8033330715513592
This study gives a survey of the publications of articles about the care of the newborn around 1900.	0.9318216204463674
A main paediatric and obstetric journal (Archiv für Kinderheilkunde, Archiv für Gynäkologie) from the turn of the century were analysed including the years 1885-1910.	0.862905269514601
Purpose: To compare electron beam CT (EBCT) und prospectively ECG gated conventional CT for the detection and quantification of coronary artery calcifications.	1.1046975837795336
In Europe, saprophytic pulmonary aspergillosis represents the only mycotic infection relevant for thoracic surgery.	0.6710121215041636
From the pathogenetic point of view, it is a colonization of preexisting lung or pleural cavities following other severe pulmonary diseases.	0.9531027255772119
The incidence amounts to 0.4% among patients in a special hospital for pulmonary diseases.	1.1801430822655306
Concerning this review, the diagnosis is based on histologic examination for all 66 patients we operated on between 1961 and 1996.	1.2117712840781805
Preoperative proof of the fungal infection remains difficult.	0.6646657019937238
The majority of patients (77%) are male.	1.1930647060818775
There is a correlation between cigarette smoking and abuse of alcohol on the one hand and the incidence of the disease on the other hand.	1.1290183202007915
A higher incidence of saprophytic pulmonary aspergillosis was found for people working in agriculture, in the building trade, and in paper mills.	1.2795072233781914
Pulmonary tuberculosis and pneumonia were present in the past history in 47% of the patients.	1.0716688942798156
Usually, the tentative diagnosis is based on chest x-ray, especially if hemoptysis is present.	1.238965468933186
Major hemoptysis is the most severe and most dangerous complication caused by aspergilloma.	1.038366398010846
Clinical presentation and chest x-ray findings are non-characteristic.	0.7632506501725983
Nowadays, the typical x-ray of pulmonary aspergilloma, almost always localized in the upper lobes, became a rare finding.	1.2911132925639042
If an aspergillus infection is suspected, serologic methods are reliable and sensitive.	0.7664073915999855
A surgical procedure is absolutely indicated in patients with major hemoptysis in their history, in case of disease progression or indeterminate mass and in order to avoid fungal dissemination.	1.147537407592761
If a saprophytic aspergillosis is suspected according to radiologic findings, clinical examination, and patient's social history, an operation is justified.	1.1494891153944935
Relative surgical indications are hepatotoxic and carcinogenic effects of the mycotoxins.	0.8728379903570711
The lobectomy, if necessary carried out as pleuro-lobectomy, is the adequate resection in most patients (68%).	1.2691018299432726
However, this operation is technically demanding and it usually requires a longer operating time as compared to lobectomies for other underlying diseases.	1.189335003600562
Peri- and postoperative complications occur in 60% of resections for pulmonary aspergilloma.	1.3264429881303406
A higher incidence of postoperative complications was found for smaller resections, like segmentectomies or wedge resections, as compared to lobectomies.	1.1751935657273451
Persistent pleural space problems connected with a prolonged stay in the hospital remains the main problem.	1.054549390387305
It requires a primary or secondary thoracoplasty in a number of patients.	0.8324304083954325
The operative mortality rate is 3%.	0.8330475211678648
A systemic antifungal therapy is not an appropriate treatment for saprophytic pulmonary aspergillosis and can even cause specific complications.	0.9933219949247853
Introduction: Postoperative delirium is a common psychic disturbance occurring acutely after various surgical procedures and typically presenting with a fluctuating course.	1.2062831135146013
These patients' recovery takes longer.	0.6246752688690986
In this study we analyze the incidence of postoperative delirium in patients undergoing vascular surgery and try to identify risk factors for its development.	1.2408619802836944
Methods: Patients undergoing elective arterial operations were included.	1.1455878764367056
Their medical history, the specific vascular diagnosis and operation performed, the medication and laboratory data were monitored.	1.163152512113542
Additionally the patients were preoperatively interviewed by a psychiatrist.	1.0160687453321176
Intraoperatively the drugs, infusions, possible transfusions, blood gases and pressures were monitored, as were the times of surgery and anesthesia.	1.1603205776388326
Postoperatively patients were seen daily by the psychiatrist and the surgeon for at least 7 days.	0.9171278529420295
Postoperative delirium was diagnosed according to DSM IV criteria, and mild, moderate and severe delirium were distinguished.	1.0162540704673368
Results: Fifty-four patients entered the study.	1.0436670084989272
Twenty-one (38.9 %) developed postoperative delirium (11 mild, 2 moderate, 8 severe).	1.2981489616264128
Patients with aortic operations developed delirium more frequently than those with non-aortic procedures(55.5 vs 22.2 %, n = 27 each).	1.0857091283823168
Some preexisting diseases (hearing disturbance) increased the probability of postoperative delirium, while age was not identified as a risk factor.	1.0954408993318872
General psychopathological and depressive disturbances increased the likelihood of postoperative delirium.	0.7578828174522716
Patients who had a severe intraoperative course developed postoperative delirium more frequently.	0.8869643799198392
This was not seen in the absolute time of surgery or anesthesia nor in the intraoperative development of blood pressure or intraarterial gases, which did not differ between patients with and without postoperative delirium.	1.0833046519356349
More reliable parameters were an increased intraoperative need for crystalloid volume, intra - or postoperatively decreased hemoglobin values (Hb < 10 g/dl) and the development of acidosis that had to be treated.	1.3771928005761238
Patients with delirium had serious complications more often (8/21 = 38.1 % vs 6/33 = 18.2 %) and needed Intensive Care treatment longer (2.7 vs 2.1 days, only aortic surgery 3.2 vs 2.4 days).	1.2939756879608266
Conclusions: Postoperative delirium after vascular surgery is frequent.	1.226351364480833
Patients undergoing aortic surgery, with specific concomittant medical disease, psychopathological disturbances and a severe intraoperative course, are at risk of developing postoperative delirium.	1.1176483677395075
This report summarizes our experiences with the subjective visual vertical (SVV) as a clinical neuro-otological tool.	1.0715298131535678
In the SVV test, patients have to orient a dim light bar in an otherwise dark surrounding earth-vertical, using a remote-control.	1.0177404200688145
Normal subjects in an upright position did not deviate more than 2 ° from true vertical.	0.8160643763874275
After vestibular neurectomy, the SVV was consistently tilted by some 12 ° toward the affected ear.	0.9827168528297762
Smaller tilts (~7 °) of the SVV occured in patients with spontaneous peripheral vestibular diseases.	1.3845124381966127
This shift in SVV disappeared within weeks to months, similar to the spontaneous nystagmus.	0.8700779469235501
After stapes surgery slight deviations of the SVV towards the unoperated ear were seen in about 20% of the patients, indicating a slight irritation of the otolith organs.	0.9751902173551873
Assessed in an upright position, the SVV thus may be regarded as reflecting tonic otolithic input differences between the two ears.	1.0100946106661075
Introduction: Vocal cord paralysis is a important complication in thyroid gland surgery.	1.0758355898303529
A prospective study was conducted ascertain the frequency of laryngeal nerve palsy not caused by surgical trauma.	1.0472547082902435
Patients and Methods: Two hundred and ten patients were investigated laryngoscopically pre- and postoperatively after short-term intubation in the course of operations far removed from thorax or neck region.	1.1018204569544787
We noted the inner diameter of the tube, intubation problems, the qualification of the anaesthesiologist and the positioning of the patient.	1.0972200923539264
Results: Preoperatively we found previously unknown unilateral laryngeal nerve palsy in 1.9 % of cases.	1.0635327673513375
Postoperatively there were pathological findings of vocal cords in 13 patients (6.2 %).	0.8773804955323127
In 10 patients a direct lesion (oedema, rubor, haematoma, granuloma) was established.	0.965490260754513
Three patients (1.4 %) were found to have a movement disorder caused by a neural lesion without morphological findings, leading to restitutio ad integrum in two of three cases after 6 months.	1.1387607952018381
Conclusion: The frequency of intubation-related recurrent nerve palsy is 1.4 % transiently and 0.5 % permanently.	1.180687723772381
Preoperative laryngoscopic investigation of vocal cords should be carried out before intubation.	0.7575456541876903
Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) are the most frequent infections cause of genital ulcerations.	1.2502704332112364
Although genital infections by HSV-1 are increasing HSV-2 is dominant in recurrent infections.	0.8626349960422682
This study was conducted on a panel of sera collected anonymously in 1996 and 1997 from blood donors (1979 samples) and hospital patients (3079 samples) without risk factors for herpesvirus infections such as STD, other infectious diseases and immunosuppression.	1.146985050247953
Serum samples were tested with ELISAs using monoclonal antibody-selected native gG1 and gG2 as antigens and an immunoblot using type-specific recombinant glycoproteins.	0.820219880991732
Equivocal results were confirmed with an in-house Western blot.	0.8787909416759908
This study investigates the effects of acamprosate, a glutamatergic modulator, and the lipid peroxidation inhibitor U-101033E on neurological outcome following incomplete cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in rats.	1.017756948248552
We report on three family members suffering from both autosomal dominant Hailey-Hailey disease and bipolar affective disorder.	0.983459799384625
As molecular biology techniques have made the localization of genes causing simple Mendelian traits possible as a routine task, the gene for Hailey-Hailey disease will presumably be localized in the foreseeable future.	1.0249112613997287
The Hailey-Hailey gene and its chromosomal surrounding will then be a region of interest for linkage studies in bipolar affective disorder.	0.8765460080894667
Background: Osteoporotic fractures occur frequently also in men.	1.1879851397858567
Epidemiologic data from Germany indicate that more than 900,000 men are affected by osteoporotic fractures.	0.8811528401293244
Diagnosis and therapy of male osteoporosis are hampered by a lack of clinical studies.	0.9150101549680291
Recurrent headaches and recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) are the most common pain syndromes in childhood: The prevalence of tension headache amounts to 20-50 %, of migraine to 5-7 % and of RAP to 15-30 %.	1.365440741784992
In nearly 50 % of children the complaints persist over many years of their life-span.	1.1798538619457295
The unfavourable long-term prognosis support the indication of early and specific interventions.	1.155560532886855
Empirical findings on the etiology, pathogenesis, and pathophysiology are still very limited.	0.9267919355538106
Actual approaches suggest to understand recurrent pain syndromes as a complex and multidimensional disturbance, and in this context there is strong evidence for the major importance of psychosocial influences.	1.263443366623853
The behavioral-medicine proceeding bases upon an extensive family anamnestic exploration and symptom analysis.	0.7407276620725857
The psychological interventions applied in clinical practice include prophylaxis (stress inoculation, cognitive redefinition, problem solving), reduction of pain symptoms (relaxation, distraction, imagination) and environmental modification (parental reinforcement and modeling behavior).	1.1014772611627301
During the last years there has been an increasing trend to create more complex and multidimensional behavioral pain management programs for children.	1.0296175822961573
The aim of our study was to develop noninvasive stereotactic radiotherapy for patients with choroidal metastases.	0.9789233387355852
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is standard therapy for urolithiasis.	0.8704643856614658
With comparable technical principles, various lithotripters have been developed and are in routine use.	1.0038112408383792
Renal pelvic stones, calyceal stones, ureteral stones, and other special forms can be treated with varying results.	1.0635836648770434
Currently, the so-called clinically insignificant residual fragments and the recurrence of calculi are under discussion.	0.9802261343144902
Whereas the side effects of ESWL are well known, studies comparing ESWL with other endourological procedures are still lacking.	0.9294950098881182
Suramin has long been used in the treatment of onchocerciasis and trypanosomiasis.	0.7662415106987619
Recent investigations showed an antiproliferative effect of suramin on prostate carcinoma cell lines.	0.897014592768554
Ongoing clinical trials have confirmed the effect of suramin on metastasizing prostate carcinoma.	0.8562665783598085
Five patients with metastatic prostate carcinoma resistant to classic hormonal therapy were treated with high-dose suramin.	1.0380441751656646
Four of the five developed a papulovesicular or maculopapular rash within 2 - 4 weeks of starting therapy.	1.0656438973015656
The rashes disappeared after discontinuation of suramin within 10 days.	0.6928080932658148
In tumour therapy, high dosages of suramin are used to achieve a serum level of 200 - 300 µg/ml.	1.1718053680965748
Therefore, a toxic reaction to suramin is suspected as the explanation for the skin rashes.	1.0652399453647514
Acetylcholinesterase (ACE) inhibitor-induced angioedema is supposed to be an uncommon cause for oropharyngeal edema.	1.0170014644608254
Between January 1, 1993 and February 1, 1997 we treated 20 patients with edema of the oropharyngeal region that was not caused by infection or irradiation.	0.9851908504386361
The most common reason was an ACE-inhibitor-induced angioedema and occurred in 9 cases, all of whom required inpatient treatment.	1.1381768962425114
The medical management consisted of the administra- tion of intravenous (i.v.)	0.8383977712098589
glucocorticosteroids in all cases, H1-blockers in 6 cases, epinephrine by inhalation in one case and i.v.	1.0336176175062537
Tracheostomy had to be performed in one patient.	1.2713067044653397
In our experience it is necessary to reconsider ACE inhibitor-induced angioedma in any case of an oropharyngeal edema.	1.060862552514616
However, there is no reason for the routine application of epinephrine in these cases.	1.3097192608307815
After treatment of more than 3000 kidney and ureteral stones with the Siemens Lithostar Multiline the results of the first 1400 ureteral stone treatments using the "Booster technique" and 3-month follow-up findings are reported.	1.1561207359989754
There was a disintegration rate of 98 % directly after treatment; 1 week after "Booster technique" treatment 96 % of the patients were free of stones and without any symptoms.	1.213314571632656
The 3-month follow-up showed a stone-free rate of 97 %.	1.0196293507021728
Only in 13 % of the cases auxiliary procedures were neccessary, 7 % of them before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and 6 % after ESWL.	1.336289964008294
43 % of the treatments were performed without any premedication, anaesthesia or sedoanalgesia.	1.1936853962779235
Our data even prove that in situ ESWL is a safe and effective method for the treatment of ureteral stones.	0.8785239931877811
In comparison to endoscopic procedures, it is superior in regard to invasivity, side effects, complications and neccessity of analgesia, while being just as efficient.	1.0677106755830634
Therefore it is recommended as first choice method in the treatment of ureteral stones.	1.0622204053622024
The perspectives for active hearing implants lie in the treatment of patients with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL).	0.7418750455134713
The majority of patients with SNHL suffer from a cochlea amplifier (CA) failure which is discernible by a positive recruitment and loss of otoacoustic emissions (OAE).	0.9616280808202098
Therefore, the electronic implant is expected to partially replace functions of the CA.	1.0502925878505749
Thus, the implant is thought to function as a CAI (cochlea amplifier implant).	1.0156687640690898
An approved implant for routine use is not yet available.	1.0348560185028124
Clinical studies have thus far only used the high energy consuming (HEC), narrow-band, electromagnetic floating-mass transducer, as well as the Maniglia-HEC implant.	1.09721699295031
The high energie consuming, yet broadband Canadian Fredrickson implant is soon to be used in humans.	1.0217525731626964
Of the piezoelectrical implants, a German CAI (Tübingen implant) at present consisting of a piezoelectrical transducer and a microphone has thus far been acutely implanted in first patient.	1.0273613735230782
It is a low energy consuming (LEC), broad-band implantable system for patients with sensorineural hearing loss.	1.0922393486363062
Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) was de-scribed electroclinically by Janz and Christian in 1957 and consists of myoclonic jerks in  varying combination with the absence of seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, a typical circadian distribution on awakening, sleep deprivation, alcohol consumption and flickering stimuli as characteristic precipitating factors, typical EEG abnormalities with generalized epileptiform discharges, normal physical and neuroradiological findings, and often a family history of epilepsy.	1.0321105352688897
Although the misdiagnosis of this well-classified and easily treatable syndrome is supposed to occur rarely in Germany, we retrospectively investigated how often the wrong initial classification had been made among patients who were finally treated in our outpatient epilepsy unit.	1.1443810650273831
Between 1993 and 1995, 30 patients with a typical JME-like symptom constellation were identified who had been misdiagnosed initially.	1.0066398055547574
In all patients, localization-related epilepsy had been classified, although regional EEG abnormalities were rare (n=5).	1.0023827025108563
All patients reported the typical circadian distribution, abnormal neuroradiological findings were absent, and typical EEG abnormalities were present in all cases.	1.0633952599713634
Under treatment with appropiate antiepileptic drugs 97% of the patients became almost completely seizure-free.	1.0244654113475844
Even 40 years after the first description of the syndrome, JME is an underdiagnosed illness.	1.1001723625407438
The generally  positive course underlines the importance of its correct identification.	0.7526398114831193
Background: The aim of the study was to evaluate results of visual acuity and binocularity and complications after cataract surgery with primary capsular bag-fixated IOL implantation in children.	1.0309670464357565
Arterial hypertension is known to be an important risk factor for cerebral and cardiovascular disease.	1.1028841371729952
Previous studies have demonstrated alterations in the perifoveal microcirculation in patients with essential hypertension.	0.9513959897844055
During follow-up a progression of these alterations has been reported.	0.9556160321911901
In the present study we quantified the retinal microcirculation of patients with hypertension under different systemic antihypertensive medication.	1.04775725181961
Vaginal and uterine bleeding is a common symptom in gynecology.	0.7990628728112587
The cause of the bleeding should be investigated so as to exclude carcinoma as its origin.	1.0065214266539095
First, the basic circulation parameters should be determined.	0.9768612609877071
Blood volume and oxygen substitution are essential.	0.798362130908135
Depending on these findings, further diagnostic or therapeutic steps must be undertaken.	0.9452125530034181
If the situation is stable, diagnostic measures are indicated to localize the bleeding and the tumor.	1.064958015175877
A general examination, including a vaginal and rectal examination, must be performed.	1.09095244892107
Other diagnostic procedures such as ultrasound (vaginal and transabdominal) and CT or MRI may be required.	1.0178042982002287
If available, an angiography should be performed.	0.7709106456189658
Medium-term results with a follow-up of at least 3 years were done in 160 patients (average follow up 51 months) after ACL reconstruction using IKDC evaluation form and Noyes score and in 110 patients (average follow Up 53 months) after non-operative management.	1.2702262028270797
Unlike objective good parameters the subjective assessment of knee function according to the Noyes score reveals significantly worse results in cases with ACL reconstruction compared to the knees without surgery.	1.0286192832858743
The best functional results we found in professional athletes after ACL reconstruction.	0.9073068964195117
Comparable positive results of knee function is only achieved in approx.	0.9469630638304386
15 % of the patients from the natural history group, who can maintain high risk pivoting activity level feeling no giving way.	1.148880858043835
In our opinion compensatory proprioceptive mechanism account for the surpassing results in these two groups of patients.	1.1364626681626557
It will be postulated that it is not the absolute power of the hamstring but the latency period of recruition that influences the compensation of anterior knee instability.	0.9963955001686237
We have modified our rehabilitation methods in order to improve proprioception and dynamic stability of the ACL-deficient knee.	1.0176032324498276
Based on our results we primarily limitate the ACL reconstruction on a group of patients practicing high-risk-pivoting sports.	1.1173712870700563
Only when menisceal lesions appear or patients suffer from giving way episodes we support secondary surgery.	0.7157282870807814
The pivot shift sign is reflecting the dynamic aspect of knee instability.	0.7386212492942968
In our opinion it is the decisive parameter to assess knee instability unless there are useful technical procederes.	1.0594706566366647
Multiple injuries in elderly patients are still a common problem.	1.116615139506615
The present study was performed to investigate mortality and complications in multiple trauma patients aged 65 years or more.	1.0981507586479644
A total of 1154 multiple trauma patients with an injury severity score (ISS) of at least 18 points were divided in two age groups: Y: 16 - 64 years, n = 1022; O: 65 - 94 years, n = 132.	1.1519940707624499
Older patients were injured as pedestrians in most cases (69%), while younger patients were more frequently injured as car and drivers passengers (41%).	1.036989502023344
ISS was comparable in both groups (Y 28 +/- 1, O 27 +/- 1).	1.1252039156555438
During ICU-therapy incidence of ARDS (Y 10%, O 11%), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MOF; Y 6%, O 9%) and pneumonia (Y 17%, O 21%) were comparable.	1.3698165498080592
In contrast, septic complications were more frequent in older patients (Y 19%, O 27%).	1.19543090599735
Length of ICU stay (Y 19 +/- 2, O 18 +/- 1) and ventilation time (Y 14 +/- 2, O 17 +/- 1) were comparable.	1.1823262473623244
Mortality was significantly higher in older patients (Y 15%, O 53%).	1.0659332821298824
The major cause of death was sepsis in older patients (Y 15%, O 31%) and MOF in younger patients (Y 54%, O 29%).	1.2076137492161276
In conclusion, older trauma patients had a higher mortality due to the development of septical complications.	1.1281969521933837
The Raynaud phenomenon occurs in 90-100% of patients with systemic scleroderma.	1.0060425283622918
It is caused by dysregulation of the vascular tone between vasocontrictive and vasodilatory influences.	0.8369946177181675
Early damage to the vascular endothelium and the activation of platelets lead to the release of vasoactive substances.	0.9017928892206425
Structural and function impairment of the perivascular neural fibers contributes to the vasospasm.	0.7544996978051729
New vasodilatory treatment strategies, e.g.	0.4831612639009135
infusions with calcitonin gene-related peptides, could be useful in the control of vasospasm in the peripheral extremities as well as internal organs in systemic scleroderma.	1.0915399127828922
Due to the limited efficacy of drug therapy in atrial fibrillation and the high rate of recurrence, strong efforts were made to find non-pharmacological strategies.	1.1094287871973703
For three years now, the implantable atrial defibrillator Metrix from InControl has been available as an alternative therapy.	1.0048501657700466
From October 1995 to the present the atrial defibrillator was implanted in 179 patients worldwide.	0.9659081837407338
The sensitivity of the system and its algorithms to detect atrial fibrillation is 90%; the specifity to detect sinus rhythm is 100%.	1.1563660783964205
In 121 of 179 patients, 748 episodes of spontaneous atrial fibrillation were treated with 2.4 shocks per episode.	1.0072021717051027
No proarrhythmic event or stroke was seen.	0.565386338615645
A cardioversion to sinus rhythm could be achieved in 95% of patients; the overall clinical success rate was 88%.	1.2168525150453293
In 7% of all patients, early recurrence of atrial fibrillation (ERAF) occurred that could not be converted into stable sinus rhythm after further cardioversions and antiarrhythmic therapy.	1.0764679263952295
In 4.1% there were lead-related complications, in 4 patients the device had to be explanted because of ineffective therapy, and in 3 patients the device had to be changed because of loss of telemetry or early depletion of battery.	1.1115772368280061
In 8 patients, postoperative complications were seen (infections, pneumothorax and thrombosis of the subclavian vein).	1.1277067093421411
Overall, the implantable atrial defibrillator Metrix is an effective and safe alternative in treating atrial fibrillation.	1.1353110178319816
Background: The success rate of combined glaucoma and small incision cataract surgery is not yet established.	1.162400419900229
The somatosensory system of preterms and newborns differs substantially from adults.	0.769590212897111
These differences are of considerable preclinical and clinical interest.	0.7626788116776841
Maturation of A- and C-fibre synaptic connections in the dorsal horn and development of descending inhibition from the brainstem all take place postnatally in the rat.	0.9731254412311903
In early stages of development there is no definite spatial sepraration in the dorsal horn between the nociceptive and the non-nociceptive system.	1.0503603979562932
In preterms but not in adults non-noxious stimuli can induce central sensitization.	0.8701454566720498
Many neurotransmitters and signalling molecules involved in pain pathways are expressed early in the developing nervous system but do not reach adult levels for a considerable period.	0.8628775548476283
More important, receptors are frequently transiently overexpressed or expressed in areas during development where they are not seen in the adult and may have a different functional profile.	0.9722087154369647
The descending pain inhibitory system that provides an important protection against central sensitization developes later than the ascending nociceptive system.	0.881552094847733
Thus, during a critical period of time the immature nociceptive system is highly vulnerable.	1.37585031030436
For example, neonatal circumcision in the absence of analgesia results in increased pain responses during subsequent routine vaccination months later.	0.8921824282328636
Numerous studies conducted during the past decades indicate that the public's attitude toward the mentally ill is strongly prejudiced.	0.9044370207571852
Since the attitude of the general public also has an effect on community-based psychiatric care, we must ask how public opinion might be influenced.	1.0278430193408454
One possible approach could be through so-called key community leaders - those who are highly respected in society because of their competence in a particular area.	1.0506405833097654
Doctors belong to this group of people.	0.8219395223045891
For this reason we questioned medical students, as future key community leaders, with respect to their attitudes toward the mentally ill within the framework of their first contact with psychiatric patients during their studies.	1.1019546590478981
In order to make a direct comparison possible, we interviewed a sample of the Mannheim population who live in a part of the city where a variety of complementary facilities have been set up.	1.0122640132522356
The comparison shows that medical students do not have a more positive attitude toward the mentally ill; in fact, in certain areas they have an even more negative attitude toward the mentally ill than the general population has.	1.0589042759846852
We were not able to establish what effect teaching has with respect to changing attitudes.	0.7097951115494088
Systematic lymphadenectomy for colorectal cancer aims to remove potentially metastatic lymph nodes from the tumor's drainage basin.	0.9508590076070067
This requires knowledge of normal lymphatic anatomy and metastatic routes.	0.8175259938369419
Systematic lymphadenectomy performed as a standard or as an extended resection is a prerequisite for pathologic tumor staging.	1.0103733833156356
An intensive search by the pathologist for lymph node metastases is critical for precise staging.	0.9004985226332847
Recommendations as to the extent of lymphadenectomy are derived from potential improvement of prognosis and procedure-related complications.	0.9023619982070243
Life threatening hemorrhage in patients with malignant tumours of the head and neck area are often, as a result of tumour infiltration, postoperative anatomical changes, infection and radiological necrosis, difficult to control.	1.1698115926669148
One option for prophylaxis and treatment is the ligature of the external (ECA) or common carotid artery (CCA) and superior thyroid artery (STA).	1.0773717594896821
52 patients were examined in a retrospective study to determine both the hazards and the therapeutic use of the procedure.	1.3456221910161321
The external carotid artery (ECA) was ligated prophylactically during the operative procedure of tumour resection and neck dissection in 25 patients.	1.0273402423612068
In 27 cases closure of the ECA, CCA or ECA and STA was carried out as an emergency procedure for acute hemorrhage following completed primary treatment (operation, primary or postoperative radiation or radiochemotherapy).	1.0522968297853235
There was no postoperative hemorrhage after prophylactic ligature of the ECA.	0.9006900181837699
One patient with multiple cardiovascular diseases suffered from an ipsilateral cerebral infarction 1 year after operation.	1.0269650630549148
In 6 of 9 patients and in all 3 patients, in whom ligature of the CCA or ECA and STA respectively was carried out as an emergency procedure, severe neurological complications up to an apallic syndrome occured.	1.1626941647754876
The number of deaths due to acute hemorrhage was considerably smaller among those patients with prophylactic ligature of the ECA performed during operative procedure of tumor resection and neck dissection.	1.0290648598823056
In addition there were much less unfavourable courses in the sequence of prophylactic closure of the ECA than observed after ligating the CCA or ECA and STA in an emergency situation.	0.9921446667875957
The carcinoid tumor of the middle ear is a very rare neoplasm which in general is regarded as benign but may be mistaken for an adenocarcinoma because of its histological heterogeneity.	0.9920810952526777
Typical, however, is its neuroendocrine and mucinous differentiation so that an unequivocal diagnosis is possible by means of immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy.	1.0720400674996877
As the tumor is very rare, there is no statistical evidence as to whether further treatment is necessary after primary exstirpation of the tumor.	1.1276256436212684
Therefore, a review of the literature was performed.	1.252360315602243
We report about a 28-year-old male patient with a carcinoid tumor of the left tympanic cavity.	0.9731056185785674
Without any further treatment there has been no evidence for either recurrence or metastases 32 months after surgical resection.	1.0849493989200503
As treatment of choice we recommend conservative surgery with complete removal of the tumor and a clinical follow-up on a regular basis.	1.2097368256536734
Intraoperative precision in computer-assisted surgery depends on the characteristics of a navigation system, the precision of correlation between object and data set, the position, number and fixation of landmarks, and the parameters of the data set.	1.2039713365729285
The characteristics of a navigation system, in particular the immanent precision, can be detected by the use of the geometric model and navigation analyzer developed at the University of Regensburg with the support of Carl Zeiss, Germany.	1.1244422214547027
The precision of five navigation systems of different types and technology was measured: Viewing Wand (ISG, mechanical system), the SMN microscope (Carl Zeiss, infrared system with laser autofocus), the MKM system (Carl Zeiss, robot platform with laser autofocus) and the STP pointer (Leibinger, infrared system).	1.072375570904052
The immanent precision of these systems ranges from 0.1 to 2.0 mm.	1.3819438653173926
An electromagnetic system (3-Space Digitizer, Polhemus) was compared; this produces serious spherical deviations of 10.0 to 20.0 mm in the presence of metal, surgical and rotating instruments, and circuits.	1.2868759427404157
The application of these different systems for craniomaxillofacial surgery is discussed.	0.7972928383731964
The aim of the study was to record retrospectively the events of Pneumocystis carinii-Pneumonia (PCP) among HIV-infected children (<18 years) in Germany.	1.2006294125560117
The patients were evaluated with regard to prophylaxis, course of disease and prognosis.	1.362033613454119
In this study we looked at the relationship between extracorporal circulation and changes in blood electrolytes.	1.0445457291420017
Glucocorticoids are a potent cause of osteoporosis and thus a potential source of substantial morbidity in patients who are already significantly disabled by their underlying condition.	1.0798812118906964
These agent interact with calcium metabolism at many levels; in particular they reduce the osteoblast's synthesis of the principal proteins of bone matrix.	1.0466751270331296
They also reduce circulating sex hormone concentrations, particularly in men and postmenopausal women.	0.9444310856492708
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), which form a rare group of neoplasias of the gastrointestinal tract, have not yet been fully investigated.	1.1320115364136532
Although good progress has been made in their diagnosis, classification of these lesions with regard to their histogenesis and biological behavior remains problematic.	1.1974863154255415
Between 1994 and 1998, 18 GIST patients underwere operation in the Department of Surgery.	0.844929108950319
Twelve of these patients (67 %) had stromal tumors in the stomach, and six (33 %) had intestinal stromal tumors.	1.2436307353039784
The primary tumor could be removed in all patients with R0 resection.	1.2423990675104775
Six patients developed hematogenous liver metastasis, with the size of their primary tumor exceeding 10 cm.	1.1025634769670851
Extrahepatic distant metastases were not found in any case.	0.8934264780168014
Lymphadenectomy showed that lymph node metastases did not occur.	0.778000622666547
Histological evaluation was made according to the guidelines of Lewin, Weinstein and Riddell.	0.8212557910435453
Currently established therapy is limited to complete surgical resection of the primary tumor and its metastases.	1.2223659868463506
Adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy approaches have failed.	0.5955919377315347
Acute leptospirosis in Europe (Weil's disease) is a rare and in more than 90 % of the cases undiagnosed febrile, self-limited disease.	1.1623526295351116
We report the case of a 39-year-old sewerage worker, who was admitted to our hospital with fever, jaundice, pain in his calves and acute renal failure.	1.0465728423991438
Serology revealed elevated antibody titers against Leptospira canicola, L. icterhaemorrhagica and L. sejroe.	0.7624741251412853
The patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with diffuse gastrointestinal bleeding due to thrombocytopenia.	0.9532132174527285
The ECG showed atrial fibrillation with irregularly irregular rhythm.	0.8638764701732077
Cardiac arrest developed, most likely due to hypoxia, with a drop in the blood pressure.	1.2162982415981334
Despite immediate resuscitation efforts the patient developed severe hypoxic brain damage and died a few days later.	1.0526149815184445
Autopsy disclosed histologic signs of a generalized leptospiral infection, signs of shock and within the lungs a necrotizing herpes simplex virus pneumonia causing the death of the patient.	0.9284608539591762
The virus pneumonia most probably was caused by retrograde canalicular dissemination of oral secretions since herpetic tracheitis and esophagitis were found and herpetic lesions were readily identified on the lips and tongue.	0.8704257328173943
A medical opinion asked for by the professional association having liability for occupational safety and insurance was given, the disease being recognized as an occupational disease.	0.9907876522566958
During the past decade, the molecular mechanisms in the process of tumor progression, including metastasis and angiogenesis, have become better understood.	1.3131139024784682
Cancer metastasis consists of multiple, complex interacting steps.	0.8141607570604926
Each of these steps is crucial and limiting, since a failure to complete any one prevents the tumor cell from producing a metastasis.	1.0496530742418955
Detachment from the solid tumor by loosening the intercellular junctions and proteolysis of the extracellular matrix enables tumor cells to enter blood- and lymph vessels.	0.9573177204082566
The intravasation into the circulation is supported by the secretion of angiogenic factors, which induce degradation of the basal membran in blood vessels.	1.0736666322330346
Adhesion to endothelial cells, extravasation from the circulation, and induction of angiogenesis are further essential steps for completing the metastatic process.	0.8791941668637132
Furthermore, it is well known that once a tumor cell has entered circulation, it will survive only by evasion of the immune system.	1.1946793901364352
The systematic identification of tumor antigens opens up new possibilities for immunotherapeutic approaches.	0.6899961329188461
Hypogonadism is the main indication for testosterone substitution in the ageing male.	0.8753292922117003
The choice of the testosterone preparation should be based on the principle that serum levels of testosterone remain in the normal range and fast termination of therapy is possible.	1.0284436074159038
To date, transdermal testosterone systems appear to be best suited for substitution therapy in the ageing male.	0.8529673521270178
Future promising developments are testosterone gels and intramuscular testosterone undecanoate.	0.6344305712246142
Any testosterone therapy in the ageing male has to be monitored closely, especially regarding erythropoiesis and the prostate.	1.1046443158322028
Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is a disease that involves the lining of joints, bursae and tendon sheaths.	0.9566619244780566
The incidence is low and estimated to be 1.8 patients per million population.	1.0448554143724669
The cause of PVNS is unclear and discussed to be either inflammatory or neoplastic.	0.8874749226380385
PVNS has been described in 2 forms different for prognosis and treatment (nodular and diffuse).	0.9970648099272941
The articular form almost appeares in the knee joint as we describe below in a 14 year-old patient.	1.0505897244941493
In this retrospective study, 13 patients with subtle Lisfranc joint injuries were examined after a mean period of 23 months using clinical assessment, radiography and dynamic pedographic gait analysis.	0.9486398147446813
The aims were to identify the factors leading to a mobile flatfoot deformity, evaluate the functional and clinical outcome of these injuries, and draw practical conclusions for initial management and subsequent intervention.	1.063356339715411
All patients showed a mobile flatfoot deformity, increased motion in the subtalar joint, increased load on the hindfoot, decreased load on the forefoot, and a prolonged contact phase during the stance phase.	1.1332467536950404
Radiographs revealed progressive osteoarthrosis in the joint and a residual displacement of the medial Lisfranc joint.	1.0125270443631351
An unstable medial Lisfranc joint results in the development of a mobile flatfoot.	0.9615925172735135
Initial treatment of a subtly displaced Lisfranc joint should consist of exact anatomical reduction and additional maintenance of the longitudinal arch of the foot.	0.9414454391687309
After failed initial treatment, early arthrodesis of the midfoot is recommended as a salvage procedure for the foot.	1.070265999560208
Cross-sectional imaging with CT and MRI plays an indispensable complementary role to endoscopy in the pretherapeutic workup and staging of laryngeal neoplasms.	0.9764558357558865
Adequate interpretation of the CT and MR images requires a thorough knowledge of the patterns of submucosal spread and familiarity with the diagnostic signs of neoplastic invasion as seen with each modality.	1.0195741330420327
In addition, the radiologist should be aware of the implications of imaging for staging and treatment.	0.9446724557407687
Both CT and MR imaging are highly sensitive for the detection of neoplastic invasion of the pre-epiglottic space, paraglottic space, subglottic region and cartilage.	0.8889835178194927
The high negative predictive value of both CT and MRI allows exclusion of neoplastic cartilage invasion quite reliably.	0.8438209697385984
The specificity of both CT and MRI is, however, limited and both methods may therefore overestimate the extent of tumor spread.	1.1686502351338204
Nevertheless, both cross-sectional imaging methods significantly improve the pretherapeutic staging accuracy of laryngeal tumors if used in addition to clinical examination and endoscopic biopsy.	1.2951862832453283
In the presence of a submucosal mass, CT and MRI play a key role for the diagnosis, as they may characterize the lesion, reliably depict its submucosal extent, and guide the endoscopist to perform deep biopsies that allow a definitive histological diagnosis.	1.0947932010034074
Background: HLA-DR antigen plays a key role in transplantation immunology.	1.2000593234491934
Organ culture storage leads to loss of HLA-DR-positive corneal Langerhans cells.	0.6547522181946189
This study investigates the importance of prolonged storage period for the success rate after penetrating keratoplasty.	1.0074511181437837
Ergotamine-containing drugs are widely used in the treatment of acute migraine attacks.	0.9859729000820114
Among others, spastic vasoconstrictions are one of the possible side effects usually affecting the lower extremities and sometimes leading to gangrene.	0.898686808326334
The case of a 75 year old woman is presented who was suffering from migraine-attacks since adolescence.	1.1552308947500056
Due to longterm use of ergotamine containing suppositories she developed perianal ulcers.	0.6877725827138629
After withdrawl of the drug the ulcers healed up entirely.	0.9559322062114884
The spectrum of ergotamine-induced side-effects and possible intervention strategies are discussed.	0.9338164715742736
In this article, a model of quality assurance for inpatient psychotherapy is discussed, which was developed in cooperation between researchers and clinicians.	1.243831879521998
This model is based on the concept of internal quality assurance with external help.	0.9316468828118774
The Heidelberg Model of Active Internal Quality Assurance has three elements: (1.)	0.9987461982231657
a QA-Inventory for routine monitoring; (2.)	1.1632191082697674
rules for evaluating the outcome of every patient and (3.)	1.2133678381186621
a feedback model for communicating the results to the therapists (quality circles).	0.8979264082547219
The focus of this model is the recognition of problematic results.	0.9937478675326386
It is mainly these results that will be discussed in our quality circles, where the outcome of treatments from the perspective of the inventory and of the therapists are discussed.	1.142119009530472
This feedback model and the quality circles will be explained with three examples of patients.	0.9944428711341732
The Heidelberg Model of Active Internal Quality Assurance will be seen as the basis of a concept of Quality Assurance, which is aimed at assuring and improving the quality and rationality of the psychotherapeutic service.	1.1089125200632588
Aims: In this study the technique of intravenous regional anesthesia (Bier block) was evaluated as an experimental tool to differentiate peripheral and central effects of analgesics.	1.2924331358322403
A pre-term infant weighing 900 g, gestational age 25 weeks, developed an acute abdomen.	0.9995926384642603
Intravenous lines had been inserted previously in the left (silasticcatheter) and right (24 G cannula) saphenous veins in the neonatal intensive care unit.	1.1471364737194698
During surgical exploration, a perforation of the terminal ileum was found.	0.9621404630520496
The operation consisted in partial resection of the perforated ileum with an end-to-end anastomosis and a double-lumen colostomy.	0.8238455353797505
Major blood loss during the procedure caused serious haemodynamic problems.	0.9019211684804361
Despite transfusion of erythrocyte (100 ml), thrombocytes (75 ml), and albumin (50 ml), the patient developed bradycardia and hypotension.	1.448993269913483
Administration of atropine, adrenaline, and calcium IV had no effect.	0.8536147538636577
The operation could be finished only with extrathoracic resuscitation.	0.7031945732345336
When the drapes were removed, livid, swollen lower limbs raised the suspicion of an acute thrombosis of the inferior vena cava.	0.9160592224045208
After insertion of a 24 G IV cannula into a vein of the right upper arm, the circulation stabilised after rapid transfusion of 40 ml blood and 25 ml thrombocytes and resuscitation was successful.	1.1127426601957104
Paediatricians and anaesthesiologists must consider the risk of thrombosis of the vena cava.	0.8783809416194143
If venous lines in the lower limbs are not visible to the anaesthesiologist during the operation, venipuncture of veins of an upper limb is recommended before starting the surgical procedure.	1.0648774009348585
Due to the high incidence of vena cava thrombosis caused by central venous lines and the difficulty of peripheral venipuncture in pre-termintanty, a safe venous line should be inserted if necessary by pre-operative venesection.	1.0410578749781645
While complementary medicine and homeopathy is becoming an increasingly prominent part of the health care practices, there is a lack of controlled studies concerning their effectiveness.	0.9276462610010832
In our study, we wanted to answer the question whether a combination of Formica rufa D6 and reinjection of the patient's own blood is superior to injection of placebo.	1.084521938047844
104 patients with ankylosing spondylitis entered a prospective, randomized, double-blind study.	0.6413698697833703
During four weeks they received twice weekly either 1 ml of Formica rufa D6 in combination with 0.5 ml of blood or 1.5 ml NaCl intramuscular.	1.14386563889364
Before and after therapy, mobility, thoracic excursion and doctor's overall assessment were measured in addition to patient's health status, using a German version of the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales, before and after therapy as well as four, twelve, and twentyfour weeks later.	1.1008705155046627
We were not able to detect any statistical difference between treatment and placebo group in any of the parameters measured.	0.9928577271361706
Therefore, the therapy under study may not be regarded effective.	1.0777516088982262
A 32-year-old man was accused of attempted rape.	0.8951287178931792
While urinating at the side of the road he felt an erection.	0.7264818172957557
He approached a 9-year-old girl who happened to be coming along and pressed his penis between her legs until ejaculation.	0.8957669387613342
Shortly afterwards he was arrested.	0.5552536208611644
He confessed, but claimed partial amnesia and had no explanation for the offence, which he normally would never have thought of.	1.0661578872940949
Shortly before the event a witness had seen him nearby in a poor state of orientation.	0.8393442231330333
Three months later in prison he suffered massive subarachnoidal hemorrhage from an aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery.	0.984520233035642
The evaluation of his legal responsibility must take account of a putative psychomotor seizure at the time of the offence.	0.9656673643907225
With regard to the aneurysm diagnosed later, a pathogenetic connection, in terms of a preceding warning leak, might be assumed.	1.1005027785506718
We present a 43-year-old patient who has had up to 15 frontal lobe seizures nightly for 12 years.	1.0296407517324873
The patient had no complaints apart from excessive daytime sleepiness.	0.970832076022713
Neurological and psychiatric examination as well as cerebral computed tomograph and magnetic resonance imaging were normal.	0.8899473520166703
After sleep deprivation an interictal electro-encephalogram demonstrated a recurrent excess of theta activity over the right frontal and frontopolar area.	0.768144707639732
A cerebral PET study showed diminished glucose metabolism of the right cingular and frontomesial region.	0.9567295995118709
The sleep structure was extremely fragmented.	0.5848512912121347
There was an excessive reduction of slow-wave sleep and REM sleep.	0.9512396596303094
Carbamazepine therapy produced complete seizure control lasting a few weeks, followed by return of up to 8 seizures per night.	0.8991301333022323
Vigabatrin as add on therapy diminished the noctural seizures to 1 to 3 per night.	0.8250243200616798
Introduction: We attempted to optimize the determination of energy expenditure and substrate utilisation in VLBW infants for practical use in a tertiary care center.	1.026613770673575
The influence of measuring conditions upon results as well as of caloric intake and food composition on substrate utilisation and growth were investigated.	0.9584964400270493
We report a truck driver with severe soft tissue contusion of both legs who developed atypical heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) after a thrombosis prophylaxis with unfractionated heparin; despite a thrombosis the patient showed a systemic allergic reaction to heparin in combination with elevation of thrombocytes and positive heparin-dependent antibodies.	1.0710225314683335
Six days after the initial trauma deep vein thrombosis of the left lower leg was diagnosed and fasciotomy was performed, preventing an imminent compartment syndrome.	1.1477466679010804
Another 5 days later the patient developed exanthema of the trunk and upper extremities and urticaria on his face, as well as severe headache.	1.1122649894430137
His platelet count increased from 134 000/µl to 258 000/µl.	0.6840030378813287
After exclusion of other causes for these symptoms, a reaction to heparin-dependent antibodies (heparin-platelet-factor 4 complex) was demonstrated 2 days later.	1.10061929712125
Thrombosis prophylaxis was changed to hirudin (Refludan) and elevation of thrombocytes to 445 000/µl was noted.	0.8666664446745366
Shortly after rinsing of an intravenous line with less than 50 IE unfractionated heparin at day 36 after trauma the patient developed an anaphylactic shock, which could be managed with cortisone.	1.0567866904886114
We suggest that in HIT the thrombocytopenia may represent only one form of an allergic reaction to heparin.	0.8299345697018111
The cause of the thrombembolic event is an antigen-antibody reaction to heparin taking place on the surface of the thrombocyte.	0.940972536591007
This is similar in all forms of systemic reaction to heparin application, even though the symptoms may vary.	1.1407398009267176
As thrombocytopenia may not be the main symptom of a heparin-induced antibody reaction - in our hospital only 5 of 10 patients with HIT - the disease should rather be named "heparin allergy".	1.326437292790188
We suggest a new classification of different pattern of heparin allergy types I-IV.	0.9845594085188465
The new types I and II are similar to HIT types I and II.	0.7814336662081321
Type III is the reaction of antibodies without decrease of thrombocytes, and type IV the reaction of antibodies associated with systemic allergic symptoms.	1.0706067904933918
In recent years, lengthening the human mandible by distraction osteogenesis has become an accepted treatment to correct severe mandibular hypoplasia.	0.8663998711640132
Using intraoral unidirectional and extraoral bidirectional distraction devices we report about our experiences and results in the application of the bone distraction technique in four selected cases of syndromal disease, including various forms of mandibular hypoplastic malformations.	1.1461925466131357
The patients involved were a boy with Pierre Robin syndrome, a girl with unilateral facial hypoplasia in Goldenhar's syndrome, a case with Nager's syndrome, and a rare case of midline deficiency caused by partial deletion of chromosome 18 (18p-syndrome).	1.0844324912639878
The distraction period lasted from 6 to 30 days and new bone formation, ranging from 6 to 28 mm, was achieved.	1.0504712472308222
Real leg length discrepancies may be cosmetically disturbing and lead to gait abnormalities, pelvic obliquity with subsequent lumbar scoliosis as well as functional disturbances of hip, knee and ankle joint.	0.9294774524515481
Morbidity and mortality after reversal of Hartmann's procedure following perforated sigmoid diverticulitis are high and the rate of intestinal restoration is low.	0.9182800896948105
Aim: To investigate whether laparoscopically assisted reversal of Hartmann's procedure is technically feasible and whether the laparoscopic procedure offers any benefit to the patient.	1.0002031279603067
Method: Nineteen patients were investigated.	1.025027379399979
The postoperative course was followed prospectively.	0.8828543379795618
All patients were reinvestigated 9 months after surgery.	1.0299985040711273
Results: Laparoscopic reversal of Hartmann's procedure was attempted in 19 patients.	0.9476842756176853
One patient did not want the laparoscopic technique.	0.657076774222038
In two cases (11 %) conversion to the conventional technique was necessary; thus, 16 patients were operated laparoscopically.	1.3376896271477363
Median operative time was 114 (65-180) min.	1.0909383785762796
With the exception of three wound infections no immediate postoperative complications were noticed.	0.9500390131759692
Patients' convalescence was fast.	0.49561094195445127
First evacuation took place 3.3 (3-5) days after surgery, complete oral nutrition 3.6 (3-5) days after surgery.	1.2005177460974474
Duration of postoperative hospitalisation was 7.5 (5-12) days.	1.2794247901303704
One patient developed later a clinically significant anastomotic stricture which needed endoscopic dilatation.	0.8930487024055819
Conclusion: Laparoscopically assisted Hartmann's reversal is technically demanding but feasible.	1.0254818471013751
Postoperative morbidity is low, duration of hospitalisation short, convalescence fast.	0.7550858131072042
Thus, good arguments exist for performing reversal of Hartmann's procedures laparoscopically.	1.1684005393668466
Mechanical ventilation is a well-etablished strategy in intensive care medicine.	0.8182861785961125
ICU trauma patients require analgesia, and sedation mostly consists of benzodiazepines and opioids with increasing doses over time.	0.9882185650352044
The weaning period is complicated by the withdrawal syndrome, showing tachycardia, hypertonia, tachypnea and restlessness.	0.872683979366546
Although treatment with clonidine can influence these symptoms, tachypnea still remains the main problem in weaning patients from mechanical ventilation.	0.9543217678040858
Adding sufentanil, an opioid with greater effects on analgesia than on respiratory depression compared with fentanyl, tachypnea can be reduced to normal frequency.	1.089729562889566
In this way weaning management can be managed more easily for the benefit of both, the patient and physician.	1.2596464555787164
In comparison with a group of 50 patients treated with clonidine alone, 72 patients treated with clonidine/sufentanil showed a shorter period from the start of spontaneous ventilation until extubation (4.8 vs 7.6 days) and until discharge from the ICU (7.7 vs 12.4 days).	1.2319648970498787
The number of reintubations caused by respiratory exhaustion decreased from 16.0 to 2.8 %.	0.9291772152552565
Background: With regard to penetrating keratoplasty methods to culture corneal donor tissues, microsurgical techniques, HLA typing and understanding of basic mechanisms in inflammation and especially graft rejection, and postoperative treatment schedules have been improved in recent years.	1.089208696573852
This now enables successful penetrating keratoplasty in many more patients than previously performed.	0.8345260407538674
However, in rare cases relevant problems in wound closure may appear.	1.0995242274091692
The occurrence of a new influenza virus subtype in 1997 in Hongkong caused only minor outbreaks due to the swift and determined actions of the institutions involved.	0.9195564702127373
However, this incident again made it clear that an influenza pandemic is still a pending threat.	1.1400075226409154
As a result the WHO presented a pandemic preparedness plan which is to facilitate the global measures taken to fight an imminent or ongoing pandemic.	1.04927773006173
Strong efforts of influenza surveillance and the coordination of worldwide measures are essential to this plan.	0.8098038007941682
Furthermore the WHO suggested the developement and introduction of similar national preparedness plans.	0.8100566403703005
Given the high mortality of severe sepsis and septic shock, immunomodulation has been considered as an attractive adjunct therapy.	0.9872138908742247
Many agents have been studied that have the therapeutic potential to interfere with cytokines and other pathways which are activated during sepsis.	0.9368678432872785
Drugs having the properties to neutralize lipopolysaccharides have also been considered.	0.6948771830762954
So far all the large clinical trials with immunomodulating agents (HA1A, E5, anti TNF antibodies, ILra) have been shown to be of marginal or of no benefit.	1.1128383059403537
In certain trials results were indecisive, or mortality was increased which led to discontinue the studies.	0.9455010819419819
In certain other trials, like those on antibodies against TNF, some positive effects were seen in subcategories of patients.	1.0719344283684578
Thus, new trials are on their ways.	1.3249016142386252
So far the results of early trials has forced investigators to re-examine the concept of immunomodulation, and to redefine strategies to optimally use agents in a way that benefits the host, while not putting him at risk.	1.1347330871163561
Recently, percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy (PDT) has become more frequent, since the technique can be mastered relatively easily.	1.3123652535017893
PDT is neither time-consuming nor does it require much personell or material.	0.8293674897493567
Our study seeks to evaluate PDT in terms of its effectivness and practicality on a cardio-surgical ICU.	0.7779731852303263
Recently, two new halogenated volatile anaesthetics, sevoflurane and desflurane, have been approved for clinical use in Germany.	1.161531559378927
Their low solubility in blood is the most important common property, and this represents the most obvious difference from the inhalational anaesthetics currently used.	1.1708982809357436
Extensive clinical and experimental evaluations have confirmed the superior pharmacokinetic properties predicted.	0.8497542859457103
Both sevoflurane and desflurane provide more rapid emergence from anaesthesia, permit easier titration of the anaesthetic dose during maintenance and offer more rapid recovery from anaesthesia.	0.8632605938360671
For sevoflurane, there are additional advantages: a pleasant odor, negligible airway irritation, and excellent pharmacodynamic characteristics that even provide cardiovascular stability comparable to isoflurane.	1.1001405360774903
A certain disadvantage and source of potential nephrotoxicity result from the metabolism of sevoflurane (2-5%) to anorganic fluoride and degradation to compound A in carbon dioxide absorbents.	1.1057778334728146
The extensive clinical data reported to date have revealed no evidence that sevoflurane has adverse renal effects.	1.036637739804731
New insight into the pathomechanism of nephrotoxicity associated with either production of fluoride or compound A may well support clinical experience.	0.7997617295082725
Desflurane strongly resists in vivo metabolism and because of this it appears to be devoid of toxicity.	0.7508925146012793
Nevertheless, potential side-effects may result from degradation in dry absorbents and subsequent release of CO, from its extreme pungency and irritating airway effects.	1.1226974745651386
Thus, desflurane is not recommended for induction of anaesthesia, especially in children.	1.2890881985195914
The tendency for desflurane transiently to stimulate sympathetic activity, especially at concentrations above 1.0 MAC, limits its application in patients with cardiac disease.	1.1670704361989719
The doctor in charge, who is generally the medical director, is liable if patients suffer harm through organizational faults within his or her department.	1.0933736982927895
Even the suspicion that an error has arisen as the result of defective organization is enough for the person responsible - that is to say the medical director - to be liable.	1.191900048717418
For this reason, the doctor in charge must be in a position to recognize structural defects in organization and to correct these by means of staff training.	1.0814643416340457
Every training measure must guarantee specialist standards; this means that the work of doctors with no specialist training and those still in training and working under supervision is guaranteed to be of the same standard and performed with the same degree of meticulous care as that of a qualified specialist.	1.1385821469914048
A legally valid consent from the patient and documentation of the patient information must be accessible at all times.	1.1252477642317864
Operations carried out by doctors in training must be supervised by a qualified specialist; otherwise the doctor in charge is guilty of a defect in organization.	0.9389037291892872
Because of staff shortages it often happens that inexperienced beginners - often doctors doing their practical training - are on call very early on.	1.0763409042742187
In the high-risk specialty of obstetrics it is particularly important that doctors still undergoing practical training can call on an experienced colleague for help at all times.	1.0189030371406718
The changeover from day duty to emergency duty must be organized by the doctor in charge in such a way that the medical staff are rested and that adequate free time is guaranteed.	0.9512090088590185
There must be no friction when cooperation with other disciplines concerned is needed.	0.7754550269507874
Each sector must know its own area of responsibility.	0.7056452294648665
The doctor in charge is resonsible for seeing that his or her staff members are familiar with the use of the medical equipment.	0.8838892635147403
Uniform guidelines will make it possible for the medical director to train his/her staff and prevent systematic organizational defects.	0.9539117371626911
Georg Friedrich Stromeyer (1804- 1876) is generally known as one of the founders of orthopedics and orthopedic surgery and also made many contributions to modern military medicine.	0.9497688821931085
Furthermore, every oral and maxillofacial surgeon in Germany knows him because of the "Stromeyer hook", which is used for elevation of zygomatic arch fractures.	1.3301576199265
This special aspect as well as Stromeyer's biography is presented in this article from the history of medicine.	1.0262428993658959
Changes in clinical presentation of Crohn's disease (CD), patients' age at the time of disease manifestation and operation, general condition and duration of medical management were investigated in a retrospective study.	1.2005353230870957
395 operations for CD were divided into consecutive groups and analysed.	0.8342603600128008
In an increasing number of cases patients presented with the "fibrostenotic type" rather than the "fistulizing type" of complaints.	1.1092273988815422
The duration of disease and of medical management increased.	1.152755140391941
Patients in later groups were younger and in better general condition.	0.7964021553943281
We found a rise in frequency of patients with recurrent CD or prior abdominal surgery for other reasons.	1.0503708104037768
Primary surgery for CD increasingly consisted of resection of solitary segments of gut; in the case of recurrence, of multiple, minimal resections.	1.1503446594956095
The average total length of the resected intestine could be significantly reduced.	0.8873929789529774
The complication rate was equal in elective and emergency surgery.	0.8325744443855171
Even among the uncommon aneurysms of the visceral arteries the aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenalis artery is considered a rarity.	0.9058195164089209
Etiologically, numerous factors must be taken into account, the most significant one being arteriosclerosis.	1.2519654133655518
The clinical presentation is unspecific and ambiguous.	0.8717432714157533
CT and, above all, intra-arterial DSA allow for a diagnosis.	0.8846579952940241
A generous consideration of indicating operative intervention, even in asymptomatic patients, is especially justified because of the imminent risk of rupture.	1.1185125404602279
The preferrable therapy consists of elimination of the aneurysm either conventionally by proximal and distal ligature of the pancreaticoduodenalis artery or endovascularly by embolization.	0.8787965602235652
In the future a treatment with coated stents (TPEG) would also seem possible.	1.0161128698838038
Special attention must be paid to concomitant occlusive disease in other visceral arteries since measures for vessel reconstruction may be required because of intraoperative impairment of the collateral circulation.	0.9241917132869069
We report on the rupture of an aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenal inferior artery in association with celiac axis occlusion.	0.9968179940877127
Background: Clinical courses of eight patients with urea cycle disorders (deficiencies of carbamylphosphate-synthetase (4), argininosuccinate-synthetase (2) and argininosuccinate-lyase (2) ) are described.	1.3066400798456081
Methods/Therapy: Emergency treatment consisted of benzoate and arginine i. v. as well as peritoneal dialysis and/or modified hemodialysis.	0.9637491408901852
Chronic treatment comprised a low-protein diet and substitution of essential amino acids, of benzoate or phenylbutyrate and of branched-chain amino acids.	0.9608702989013193
Results: Within 72 hours after birth hyperammonemic coma with cerebral edema developed, leading to developmental retardation later in life.	1.0647534125866758
Four patients died between 2 weeks and 4 years of age.	0.9944203995191115
During follow-up, all patients suffered hyperammonemic derangements treated conservatively.	1.0181707463874177
Phenylbutyrate had less gastrointestinal side-effects than benzoate, branched-chain amino acids had favourable effects.	0.803646351072268
One patient was treated conservatively since birth followed by a normal development.	1.1568756094396175
Conclusions: Neonatal respiratory distress with alkalosis and rapid global deterioration should raise the suspicion of a urea cycle disorder.	0.9616465460666831
Specific therapy as described can be life-saving, although most children exhibit marked developmental delay.	1.0674116217137564
Sodium phenylbutyrate has fewer side-effects than sodium benzoate.	0.8340410784517491
Therapy prior to cerebral edema can prevent complications.	0.7573969320934083
Pronounced osteoporosis of and surrounding the acetabulum commonly leads to early loosening of endoprosthetic hip replacements following implantation.	0.8034057689832209
Large osseous defects in the subimplant bed are the result and the reason why multiple revisions of loosened acetabular cups have to be performed so often in rheumatic surgery.	1.0281978685414963
The defects extend from the cranial to the central; ventral and dorsal anchorage losses may occur in addition to this.	1.0682979177951422
The anchorage of a new implant must be adapted to the individual circumstances.	1.008960922199948
The new implant must be selected in accordance with point of surgical access, the patient's general status and osseous regenerationability.	1.1560388264676889
In the optimum case, osseous buildup of lost anatomical structures is the preferred method.	0.8401717357839016
If this is not possible, special implants, mostly custom-made prostheses, have to be incorporated.	1.0753997056712563
However, the survival time of the implants is much shorter than in patients with degenerative diseases.	1.3071197808820705
In patients with progressive muscular dystrophy (PMD) invasive electrophysiologic studies can detect hidden intracardiac conduction disturbances.	0.882317194536446
The aim of this study was a long-term follow-up of these patients.	1.1846033228773185
Twelve consecutive patients (9m, 3f, age 28 +/- 4 yrs) without cardiac symptoms and with normal echocardiographic findings were included in the study.	1.0939399994542933
They suffered from different stages of PMD type Erb (n=4), Becker-Kiener (n=4), Duchenne (n=2) and Landouzy-Déjerine (n=2).	0.9716902920437139
At the beginning of the study all patients underwent an invasive electrophysiologic study (EPS).	1.0452106432574013
The follow-up of 5.5 yrs included regular clinical visits, ECGs, and Holter recordings (every 3 months) as well as an echocardiography every 6 months.	1.1318758911265459
In 4 patients the EPS revealed a hidden interatrial conduction disturbance (AHRS-ACS 120 +/- 18ms), and in 10 pts an infrahisian conduction disturbance was found (HV max.	1.0364608979669878
Conduction defects were seen independently from the type of PMD and the stage of the disease.	0.859356650809559
During the follow-up the initially hidden interatrial conduction disturbance became evident in the surface ECG in 2 of 4 pts.	1.0164900231994882
One of them developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.	0.747679944512003
Five of 10 pts with an initially hidden infrahisian conduction disturbance developed an AV block grade I-III and in one case additionally a bundle branch block.	0.9867639625819276
Four of these pts - whose PMD showed progression or who developed congestive cardiomyopathy - needed pacemaker implantation because of a first-degree AV block + bifascicular bundle branch block (n=1), a Mobitz II second-degree AV block (n=1) or a third-degree AV block (n=2).	1.092351935497561
None of the pts with normal findings at the EPS showed abnormal p-waves, an AV block, or an intraventricular conduction disturbance during the follow-up.	1.0408926039987425
We conclude that intracardiac conduction disturbances, especially infrahisian defects including high-degree AV blocks, are a common finding in pts with PMD.	1.2540734553748378
Therefore a regular cardiological screening including an ECG and a Holter recording is reasonable in these patients.	0.8192594770285861
Accidental hypothermia is defined as an unintentional decline in the core temperature below 35 °C and is caused by exposure to cold, drugs, endocrine dysfunction, central nervous system disorders, skin disorders, and trauma.	1.0303581138343991
Depending on the degree of hypothermia, there is a progressive depression of metabolism in each organ system with specific alterations.	1.0712033280912345
Bone is among the most common sites of metastatic disease in cancers of the breast, prostate, and lung.	1.184470221411544
The decision about systemic therapy depends on the histology, presence and extent of extraskeletal disease, and the performance status of the patient.	1.128781786804624
For patients with estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer or prostate cancer, hormonal treatment represents the treatment of choice.	1.0184400253175772
In estrogen-receptor-negative breast cancer, and for patients who have failed hormonal therapy or have liver metastases, chemotherapy should be initiated.	1.1829672837986471
All patients with small-cell lung cancer should receive chemotherapy.	0.9168933857768361
Bone metastases of differentiated thyroid cancers can be treated with radioisotopes.	0.927019623333467
In non-small-cell lung cancer or renal cell cancer, systemic chemotherapy should be confined to younger patients and patients in good general condition.	1.0000462970745727
Radiologic assessment of responses of skeletal metastases to systemic therapy is often difficult.	0.9985235466821296
New approaches in measuring bone metabolites in urine might prove helpful.	0.7535830073899413
Although most prenatally diagnosed anatomic malformations are best managed after birth, we can presently offer prenatal therapy to an increasing number of fetuses with simple anatomical defects that have predictably devastating developmental consequences.	0.9907414698354796
A condition amenable to prenatal intervention must fulfill a number of conditions.	0.7456178547189357
It must be severe enough to warrant the risks associated with in utero treatment and must be reliably detectable before birth.	0.889775603717629
Furthermore, the pathophysiology must be reversible by fetal intervention, significantly improving the prognosis over postnatal treatment.	1.0331252399759465
Current indication for prenatal intervention include decompression for obstructive uropathy, temporary tracheal occlusion for congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and tumor debulking for congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lung and sacrococcygeal teratoma.	1.0589134462525438
Prenatal repair of myelomeningocele is currently being developed but remains controversial since this is not a lethal malformation.	1.0066485585314444
Maternal safety remains paramount in considering fetal intervention.	0.5991247145996748
The main associated risks are pre-term labor and preterm premature rupture of membranes.	0.8284019766487197
To reduce maternal morbidity and the risk of prematurity, minimally invasive fetoscopic techniques were developed and are increasingly employed.	0.9658408808225407
These developments will in all probability reduce the importance of open fetal surgery in the future.	0.8870663314510745
Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) has become an important cause of severe infection in hospitalized patients all over the world.	1.1184723007958866
In Germany a significant increase of nosocomial infections due to MRSA has occurred during the last 10 years.	0.8627658467674929
Especially elderly patients with chronic illnesses are at increased risk of becoming colonized or infected with MRSA.	1.0227965295752337
This report focuses on epidemiology and therapy of MRSA, and on the recommendations concerning management and prevention of spread of MRSA in hospitals and nursing homes.	1.0248687854663752
During general anaesthesia gas climate significantly is improved by performance of low flow techniques.	0.825585020079073
Gas climatisation, however, markedly also will be influenced by the temperature loss at, and corresponding water condensation within the hoses, factors which are related to the technical design and material of the patient hose system.	1.2015189353556814
The objective of this prospective study was to investigate 1. how anaesthetic gas climatisation during minimal flow anaesthesia is influenced by the technical design of different breathing hose systems in clinical practice.	1.1156667072459812
2. to investigate, whether a sufficient gas climatisation also can be gained with higher fresh gas flows if that hose system is used, proven beforehand to optimally warming and humidifying the anaesthetic gases.	1.0584444085710163
Introduction: Undifferentiated, embryonal sarcoma is a rare malignant tumour of the liver, the incidence of which is highest in children between 6 and 10 years of age (14.1 %).	1.216292948032163
Among the primary tumours of the liver in childhood it ranks in third place after hepatocellular carcinoma and focal nodular hyperplasia.	0.955768081387819
Embryonal sarcoma is much rarer in adults.	0.7260853621150805
To our knowledge, only 18 cases have been published in the last 50 years.	1.242976321203689
Methods and results: We now present the case of a 29-year-old woman with spontaneous rupture of the liver caused by an undifferentiated sarcoma.	1.2004201071003182
Conclusion: This case report illustrates the possibility of an embryonal sarcoma being the reason for spontaneous rupture of the liver.	1.3041838340589051
The management of this case comprised primary tamponade, interventional embolisation of the feeding artery, and secondary resection under stable conditions.	1.1264140619972176
Substance dependency is one of the most frequent disorders, which can be treated successfully by psychotherapy.	1.0794713586477782
However reasons are discussed, why psychotherapists probably hesitate in treating these patients.	0.796219917227405
Insufficient psychotherapeutic education concerning dependency, structural problems, expected difficulties with these patients or expected poor treatment outcome may be overcome as well as blind areas in healthprofessionals' perception concerning dependency among their patients and themselves.	0.9476958878075578
Though psychotherapy with addicts is sometimes exhausting, the readiness of psychotherapists to treat patients with substance disorders is increasing.	0.9651379145854452
Diagnosis nowadays is based on the distinction between drug depencency and drug abuse on the one hand and substance induced disorders on the other hand.	0.9039667890733936
Readiness for change and motivation for treatment are basic objects of psychotherapy in these patients.	0.9598745143923553
Therapeutic approaches to deal with this promising aspect of psychotherapy are presented.	0.8005188665128193
They are based on an empathic and clear therapeutic attitude.	0.8680087408674418
They can be easily implemented in different settings.	0.806106106243864
At the end of the first part of this review in- patient and outpatient settings for the treatment of substance disorders are outlined.	1.1639535830248617
This will be followed in the second part by an outline of different specific psychotherapeutic approaches.	0.986926668158632
The following experimental study was conducted to develop biocompatible methods of osteosynthesis in fractures of the distal radius and to evaluate their stability.	1.1220928899834424
A model of dorsal wedge osteotomy in the distal radial metaphysis was used to develop the surgical technique and to test the stability of the alternative methods of osteosynthesis.	1.1624697268781137
The concept for this model was based on commercially available materials which were either biodegradable or osteoconductive.	0.878222680449552
Four different forms of biocompatible osteosynthesis were compared to combined Kirschner wire osteosynthesis (KWO), our preferred method of treatment of unstable Colles fracture.	1.1171442054961618
Biocompatible osteosynthesis was achieved with an invasivity and stability comparable to that of KWO.	0.9152283597016537
In conclusion, injection osteosynthesis exceeded the other biocompatible methods of osteosynthesis in all respects.	0.9963363152972065
Regarding the recent developments in injectable materials for osteosynthesis it offers the best perspective for clinical application.	0.8736411309727278
The "pain in the lower limbs" (growing pain) represent one of the most frequent complaint pictures in the child orthopaedic consulting hour.	1.2393962855272014
The delimitation compared to other diseases is difficult and laborious on account of many differential diagnoses.	0.9732323206743196
Destination of our investigations was it to set up a standardized investigation diagram with recording all differential diagnoses.	0.8366231711163522
In psychotherapy with patients who do not tolerate the conditions of the 'talking cure' because they tend to act instead of verbalizing their experiences interactive entanglements are rather common.	0.852385433572318
Often this is a consequence of nonverbal gestural behavior that directs interaction in the therapeutic dialogue while the exchange of words has taken a back seat.	1.0101442825910398
The symbolic space of verbal understanding gets lost then.	0.6367669500564161
Gestural behavior does not form an independent communication system as usage of 'body language' suggests.	0.773468768610038
Instead as permanent concomitant of utterances it has primarily the function of regulating the interaction of patient and psychotherapist.	0.8862824665056305
The surgical treatment of varicous veins demands complete exclusion of the primary recirculation circuit.	0.8860683279986726
The diagnosis is made on the basis of the clinical and ultrasound symptoms, on i.e.	1.2024259374059016
If there is saphenous vein agreement between them, phlebography will yield no additional information concerning the strategy for operation.	0.8966194200899852
The prospective comparative examination of non-invasive diagnostic methods versus phlebography shows different results in 12% of cases for the great saphenous vein and in 3% for the small with a correction of the operative procedure.	1.3282160868468262
In 10 cases of incomplete trunk varicosis, only one diagnosis was correct with non-invasive measures.	1.1831614151843992
This leads to the conclusion that phlebography should be done at the time of the preoperative examination if there are differences between the clinical and ultrasound symptoms.	1.242174652877029
Undislocated odontoid fractures may lead on the basis of conventional x-rays only to a wrong conclusion with regard to biomechanical aspect of stability.	0.9922229043852862
In this aspect the classification based on Anderson and D'Alonzo takes a high risk to missunderstood the fracture stability and can results in a secondary fracture dislocation.	1.0453973148152014
Therefore it is important to make the decision about operative versus nonoperative treatment on the base of the trauma mechanism.	1.0981073080079344
In this case report we elucidate this problem and the higher risk of anterior approach for correction.	1.1107150431583646
Furthermore a better classification of densfractures will be recommended.	0.7062810812035794
In a period of 4 years between March 1994 and March 1998, 143 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) underwent laparoscopic antireflux surgery.	0.9673477398150939
According to manometric studies 76 patients had a short-floppy Nissen fundoplication, patients with impaired motility or paraesophageal hernias received a hemifundoplication (Toupet = 42, Dor/Thal = 25).	0.9376283593137904
Recurrent reflux symptoms appeared in 6,3 % after mean 16,7 months follow-up (Nissen = 2.6 %, Toupet = 2.3 %, Dor/Thal = 24 %, P < 0.01).	1.1025667284338951
Persistent dysphagia with reoperation occurred in 2.1 % (Nissen = 2.6 %, Toupet = 2.3 %, Dor/Thal = 0 %, n. s.).	1.1256212167037514
The assessment of Visick's score at the latest control showed the following: Visick I = 63.6 %, Visick II = 30.1 %, Visick III = 6.3 %, Visick IV = 0 %.	1.1738527074564988
The outcome of the operation was rated "excellent" or "good" by 91.6 % of the patients.	0.9215558033807073
In contrast to auditory brainstem potentials (ABR), a more apically defined generation of middle latency evoked potentials (MLR) can be assumed due to the longer integration time present.	1.1901561374595027
To date, the effect of stimulus frequency spectra on MLR has not been completely known.	0.8723928443852002
By using masking with high-pass filtered white noise in 12 normal-hearing adults, we measured the dependence of amplitude and latency of ABR and MLR on filter frequency.	0.9958034224095279
No differences were found between the masking effects for ABR and MLR evoked by tone bursts of 0.5 and 2 kHz.	1.0695701937479334
The high-pass masking of click stimuli showed a greater influence on the amplitude and latency of the ABR than on MLR.	1.0659359295240984
These different qualities have to be considered clinically when evaluating the methods and results of hearing testing with acoustic evoked potentials.	1.1122898311274783
Our findings show that MLR evoked by tone bursts should be used for the frequency selective diagnosis of hearing thresholds, especially in low- frequency ranges.	1.1653993466221333
Objectives: To clarify the incidence of sudden arrythmic death and associated risk factors in patients after orthotopic heart transplantation (HTx).	1.1233483837351648
Background: Some reports indicate a significant rate of sudden death in heart transplant recipients limiting long-term success of the operation.	1.34984098970458
Incidence, underlying risk factors, etiologies, and methods for prediction or prevention of sudden death are poorly defined.	1.0078173962107542
Methods: Retrospective analysis of our cohort of 120 cardiac allograft recipients surviving the perioperative phase out of a total of 142HTx patients of the years 1984-1999.	1.12828363696602
Clinical events (death, mode of death, Re-HTx, resuscitation) were noted and analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and related to the patients' characteristics by multivariate analysis.	1.10651722079836
Sudden death in or out of hospital was defined as death within one hour of symptoms or unwittnessed death.	0.9570372861733576
Clinical and postmortem findings (autopsies are available in 12/18 sudden death patients) were correlated to the mode of death.	1.0489355208612912
Results: During a mean follow-up interval of 4.6 +/- 3.5 years, 45 patients died (38%).	1.292690845942267
The mode of death was non-sudden in 27 inpatients.	0.8609066922499387
18 deaths were sudden, 14 of these out of hospital.	0.9673147498983341
In addition there were three cardiac arrests with successful resuscitations, one of those patients died three month later suddenly, giving a number of a total of 21 cardiac arrests in 20HTx patients.	1.1324623900752777
The actuarial risk of cardiac arrest was 20% after 6 and 40% after 12 years.	1.4417964376135013
Based on postmortem analysis the etiologies of the events were attributed to transplant vasculopathy in 15 patients, rejection in 5 patients (International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation grade >3A), and to unknown reasons in one.	1.0705170633556624
All three patients successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest had documented bradycardic events (2xtotal AV block, 1xsinus arrest).	0.7789402528706537
Pacemakers were implanted in these patients.	0.6224229148235373
One of those died suddenly 2 months later.	0.8188532064863455
Significantly more HTx patients dying suddenly are smokers, had a lower left ventricular ejection fraction, and worse hemodynamics.	0.9863484622840274
QRS width and PR interval were significantly broadened in patients with transplant vasculopathy and cardiac arrest.	0.8386081987603029
In three cases, a decrease in heart rate variability, the occurence of sustained VT, and ST segment depressions prior to the cardiac arrest could be demonstrated.	1.0799963293269583
Conclusions: Sudden death occurs at a substantial rate after HTx.	1.1562095841773752
As HTx patient numbers are rising constantly, sudden cardiac death in this population will represent a significant problem.	1.005693351063435
In our patients about 75% of the arrests can be attributed to graft-vasculopathy and one quarter to acute rejection.	1.1101364013716666
Diagnostic strategies have to be developed to detect patients at risk.	0.9478732731901842
Interestingly, some events may be caused from bradyarrhythmic rhythm disturbances.	1.0855293492920792
Introduction: Traumatic dislocation is the most severe ligamentous injury of the knee.	1.3237049443933344
The indications for operative and conservative treatment are still controversial.	0.8779254613240209
Methods and results: From 1974 to 1994, 38 patients with documented knee dislocation were treated operatively in our department.	1.150531110560986
Thirty-four of these patients were followed up for 3-16 years (mean: 8.6 years).	1.1780270933421335
In 29 cases of the follow-up group, reconstruction of both cruciate ligaments was performed.	0.9604502046662958
In the remaining cases the cruciate ligaments were left alone.	0.9629660628706996
At the time of follow-up, 90 % of the patients showed good knee stability, but 90 % had lack of motion as well.	1.2704629353475623
Post-traumatic osteoarthritis was mostly mild to moderate.	0.7326880674693343
Thirty-five percents of the patients achieved excellent to good results in the Lysholm Score.	1.1240590428845758
Conclusions: Positive prognostic factors were an age less than 40 years at the time of the accident, a low-energy trauma, e. g., a sports-related injury, early reconstruction of both cruciate ligaments, and initial postoperative functional treatment.	1.1901630696835208
Huntington's disease (HD) is member of a growing family of neurodegenerative diseases which are caused by a CAG-Triplet expansion in the coding region of their respective genes.	0.9666666950470938
The results of the research of the last years is very suggestive of a common pathomechanisms of all these diseases even though their clinical appearance may be quite different.	1.206031207119042
The development of new animal models by transferring the human gene defect into the mouse genome has led to the finding of so-called intranuclear inclusion bodies.	0.939378765129456
This new observation allowed to come closer to solving the problem how this genetic defect causes neurodegeneration.	0.8040054373226468
Recent studies on transgenic HD mice could also demonstrate a possible connection between the genetic defect and glutamate exitotoxicity in the neurodegenerative process of HD which had been emphasized by earlier animal models of the disease.	0.9422072711262949
Transgenic animal models of HD will have an important impact on the understanding of the disease mechanisms and may contribute to a faster development and testing of new therapeutic approaches.	1.1610645457124547
Background: The Whipple operation (PD) is the standard operation in patients with cancer of the head of the pancreas and the periampullary region.	1.2968613246893417
However, the pylorus-preserving duodenopancreatectomy (PPPD) is supposed to be superior in gastrointestinal function.	1.2407231846722921
Methods: In a prospective randomized trial (October 1994-October 1998) PD and PPPD were compared in terms of global and gastrointestinal quality of life, operation time, duration of hospital stay, transfusions and perioperative morbidity.	1.041144054699943
Quality of life was analyzed under standardized conditions (EORTC-QLQ-30) pre- and postoperatively (weeks 2, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60).	1.1352108759685438
Results: A duodenopancreatectomy was performed in 48 patients because of cancer of the head of the pancreas (n = 38) and the periampullary region (n = 10) (PD, n = 24; PPPD, n = 24).	1.3571872243010306
The PD and PPPD groups did not differ according to age, gender or UICC stage.	0.8404770983522428
Operation time was shorter in the PPPD group (206  +/-  48 vs 306  +/-  54 min) (P < 0.05).	0.9244568701148616
Morbidity did not differ between the two groups (PPPD 20 % vs PD 30 %, P > 0.05).	1.2644952477022766
While there was no difference in global quality of life, gastrointestinal quality of life was postoperatively increased in the PPPD group regarding appetite, nausea and diarrhea (P < 0.05).	0.8825904695574448
While the preoperative body weight was reached after 6 months in 85 % of the PPPD group (n = 20), this was true in only 60 % of the PD-group (n = 14) (P < 0.05).	1.1828328018412142
Conclusion: PPPD seems to be associated with a better postoperative gastrointestinal quality of life than PD.	1.1725821774648972
Oxygen uptake (V.O2) and carbon dioxide elimination (V.CO2) can be measured with an indirect calorimeter; this method is well established in routine monitoring of ICU patients to evaluate metabolic state as a reflection of stress.	1.1826286656487022
In various experimental studies it was demonstrated that anaesthetics can influence whole-body metabolism.	0.8587550465687948
The purpose of this study was to examine whether indirect calorimetry can be used intraoperatively during routine anaesthesia and whether presumable changes in metabolism can be detected immediately.	1.0479988476733264
Abdominal aortic cross-clamping changes circulation, nutritional supply of the lower extremities and thus V.O2 and V.CO2.	1.039987740870417
We therefore used this operation for our study.	0.7563932123822276
For certain indications, anterior fusion of the lumbar spine is a standard operation.	1.106934237158147
The surgeon specializing in operations on the vertebral column must leam to utilize the advantages of laparoscopic surgery.	0.8161922055287251
However, an absolute must before applying the technique to humans is adequate training in its use in living animals.	1.1862227645435153
For this purpose, the pig is a highly suitable model.	1.0381333936246753
The surgical team comprises a surgeon experienced in spinal procedures, an abdominal surgeon with expertise in laparoscopic surgery and an experienced cameraman.	1.0799732311517005
In the animal model, a change in position - organ preparation from the cranial direction, a suprasymphysial approach to the vertebrae - has proved expedient.	1.249210499496881
Operational interventions can be planned and simulated accurately with the help of a three-dimensional reconstruction of the anatomical bone structures, created from the tomographic data of a patient.	1.0043547534851538
Computer-assisted navigation systems or robotic systems can assist the intraoperative realization of the planned intervention and may support the spatial orientation within the operational field.	0.9184034634733401
The desmoplastic type of the squamous cell carcinoma (DSCC) of the skin is an entity which is readily distinguished by light microscopy.	1.243922711758619
The DSCC has fine branches surrounded by a desmoplastic stroma and shows in some cases typical perineural, perivascular and widespread intradermal invasion (maximum 6 cm!).	0.9249351378519362
This type accounts for 8.2% (n=44) of our collective of 594 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the skin and vermilion border.	1.2595055484830846
Clinically DSCC look like other malignant epithelial tumors of the skin.	0.8183202846801197
All tumors were followed up for at least 3 years (maximum 10 years).	1.0052333140721317
The local recurrence rate was high (24.3%) even though micrographic surgery was carried out.	1.193525480124548
The rate of local or regional metastasis was also very high (22.7%).	1.0396847755960135
In comparison the recurrence rate and the rate of metatasis of the remaining common 91.8% SCC's (n=550) was low: 2.6% and 3.8%, respectively.	1.231231436607283
The DSCC seems to be identical with the so called neurotropic SCC, the fine stranded SCC or the SCC with perineural invasion which have a high rate of local recurrence and metastasis as well, but DSCC is a better generic histopathologic term for the entire group.	1.04658122959644
The DSCC is best treated with micrographic surgery and wider safety margins than any other type and should be followed up very frequently.	0.9172553762788156
In the final stage of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) the majority of patients develop chronic respiratory failure due to respiratory muscle weakness.	1.0397858270690885
The interaction between the patient with ALS and the physician should be characterized by continuous communication, especially with respect to the prospect of ventilatory failure and for support.	1.2466099156900605
The patient and his family must be informed thoroughly about the natural history and the prognosis of ALS, depending on the individual disease process.	1.1278687458434962
Already in the early stage of the disease coping strategies should be discussed so that imminent respiratory emergencies can be handled.	1.1604147849963715
If ALS patients are not informed about the acute respiratory insufficiency they run the risk of having to be intubated and mechanically ventilated over a long term.	1.0957703205247742
Background: The advent of multidetector CT (MDCT) constitutes a quantum leap creating a wealth of new opportunities in medical imaging.	0.8765016645272448
However, while the basic principles of spiral CT still apply, we are now challenged to rethink our strategies in planning a CT study to take full advantage of the increased capabilities of MDCT.	1.3249310859151588
Extracorporeal photophoresis (ECP), a therapeutic modality that has been under investigation for some years, is based on separation of a leucocyte/lymphocyte-enriched cell fraction from the peripheral blood, extracorporeal treatment of the cells with 8-MOP/UVA and subsequent reinfusion of the cells in the patient.	1.2083546096107651
Its main effects seem to consist in changes to the immunologic behaviour of the photoinactivated/modulated cells.	0.8050578695891117
The immune response of the host is obviously stimulated by this treatment.	0.9155483845959884
ECP is normally performed for 4 h per day on 2 consecutive days every 4 weeks.	0.8837641703090254
The treatment is well tolerated and causes few side effects.	1.0075251997773507
In our department, 1210 ECP treatments were administered to 41 patients between 1990 and 1994 and a preliminary evaluation was performed.	1.0318689884925478
These patients included 21 with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), 10 with progressive systemic scleroderma, 4 with chronic graft-versus-host disease and 1 each with pemphigus vulgaris, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, lupus erythematosus and cutaneous mucinosis.	1.0919312777051946
Patients with erythroderma and preserved immunocompetence achieved the best responses of all patients with CTCL.	1.0110375224483343
A treatment combining ECP with rlFN-, PUVA and/or radiation was also successful in patients with tumour-stage CTCL and lymph node involvement.	1.0960802620506354
Progressive systemic scleroderma responded in more than 50% of our cases.	0.9473925990388585
Treatment results were impressive in 4 patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease presenting with sclerodermatous and lichenoid changes of the skin and mucous membranes.	1.033361613000686
A clear improvement was also observed in the patient with pemphigus vulgaris refractory to standard therapies and in another patient with scleromyxoedema (Arndt-Gottron syndrome).	1.069173695727092
The effectiveness of ECP seems to be quite well established in CTCL, but remains to be examined in autoimmune dermatoses.	1.0518426935858005
ECP is an attractive addition to the dermatological therapies available but our experience is still preliminary.	1.0237235329298462
Opportunistic infections after long-term treatment with azathioprine (AZA) have not been noted in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG).	0.9998004700971892
We report on a 56-year-old woman with generalized MG who presented with cytomegalovirus infection after being treated with AZA for 17 years.	0.9263787213819996
The indication for immunosuppressive treatment in MG should be regularly reconfirmed, particularly since at least 50% of patients can discontinue AZA after two to four years without risk of exacerbation.	1.1857833173457437
Failure to find the gallbladder at the usual or most common atypical sites during surgery for cholecystolithiasis is a rare but known problem.	1.0760709041975431
Although ultrasonography has 95 % sensitivity for the diagnosis of cholelithiasis, occasionally a small contracted gallbladder with stones and chronic cholecystitis will be difficult to visualize and can lead to erroneous interpretation.	1.0113670518175826
We report on the case of a patient presenting with abdominal colic and ultrasonographically confirmed cholecystolithiasis.	0.9929775150788579
During laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the gallbladder could not be detected.	0.8698307079244966
After laparoscopic staging followed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and abdominal computed tomography, agenesis of the gallbladder was confirmed.	0.8706292394191115
This method can be considered for diagnosis of gallbladder agenesis without the need for laparotomy and thorough exploration.	0.9860332202035659
Right colon diverticulitis, representing 1-3,6 % of cases of diverticular disease is an uncommon cause of right lower quadrant pain.	1.2968977821236838
Its presentation is difficult to distinguish from acute appendicitis.	0.871535988446347
Patients are between 35 and 50 years old, have a history of 2-3 days of abdominal pain and few gastrointestinal symptoms.	1.2193281940468907
The diagnosis is best confirmed by computed tomography and colonoscopy.	1.0063417041924796
Conservative treatment is justified in uncomplicated disease, whereas perforations, abcesses and inflammatory tumors require resection.	1.0617963732057059
We describe the cases of six patients treated at our institution from 1991 to 1996.	1.1968458088665472
Presentation, geographic variations, diagnostic procedures and management are discussed.	0.8618344153222904
Malignant melanoma is the most important differential diagnosis in both clinical and histologic examination of melanocytic nevi.	1.2070964956785275
UV exposure with an erythemagenic dose and mechanical irritation of melanocytic nevi are able to induce reversible morphologic changes which simulate malignant melanoma.	0.8507588176428079
These changes are associated with an increased expression of HMB-45 antigen.	0.9465796174312734
In addition, an increased proliferation and repair activity is observed after UV exposure.	1.2509837743424255
The increased number of melanocytes located in suprabasal layers of the epidermis is accompanied by a change in keratinocyte adhesion molecule expression.	0.9025527251358497
The UV light is also able to influence the adhesive properties of melanocytes in vitro.	0.7821036832244724
Therefore, both keratinocyte-derived factors and direct influence of UV on the melanocyte system are probably responsible for the morphologic changes.	1.1341913041430856
While these exogenously evoked changes are reversible, the potential biologic relevance - especially a possible role in the initiation of the carcinogenesis cascade - reguires clarification.	1.1601298111823775
Objectives Minimally invasive surgical procedure for removal of the trochanteric bursa and, if necessary, exostosectomy and/or fixation of the iliotibial tract at the greater trochanter.	0.8938481437044277
The treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head involves a continuum based on a radiographic spectrum of disease.	1.056632200865088
Core decompression or pharmacological agents can be utilized for the earliest small or medium-sized pre-collapsed lesions.	0.809908074244544
For these types of lesions, osteotomy has been tried by various authors with moderate success.	0.7823527450084438
For small or medium lesions that are post-collapse, various bone grafting procedures have been used.	1.0103862392208298
This approach should be tempered with a look at the articular cartilage if this is damaged or the lesion is large.	0.9590318307694318
Limited femoral resurfacing can be used for hips that do not have acetabular involvement.	0.9620259520763089
If there is acetabular involvement, total hip replacement remains the treatment of choice.	1.0733468637395762
Guillain Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the peripheral nerve system.	1.1525705877881107
Clinical hallmarks are symmetric muscle paralysis, areflexia and pronouced autonomic disturbances.	0.6415781108768958
Respiratory failure and cardiovascular instability are the main reasons for intensive care support in patients with GBS.	1.0404347293494984
The present report of a 33 year old man with Miller-Fisher syndrome, a variant of the GBS, discusses the management of patients with GBS in the intensive care unit.	1.0522535275025011
The immunocytological detection of disseminated epithelial cells in bone marrow in patients with breast cancer has been performed at many hospitals and institutes since the early 1980s.	1.0273474676102514
Despite numerous publications in this field, it has not been possible to standardize the method and  establish the ideal antibody, either nationally or internationally.	1.128845629620262
Molecular biological methods using PCR technology could extend the diagnostic spectrum.	0.8707277311753296
However, one of the major problems in breast cancer is the lack of a disease-specific marker gene.	1.3537166940768885
As a result, immunocytology is still the standard procedure for tumour cell detection.	0.9635542192591617
Objective: We report our initial experience with an improved model of the laryngeal mask airway, the intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA, commercial name Fastrach), which was designed by A.I.J.	1.2576817293162368

For several years it has been argued that a chest tube should be placed at the scene of an accident if thoracic trauma is suspected.	1.0382638484550086
However, during emergency treatment in hospital it has been observed that a high number of such tubes have been placed incorrectly.	1.4132658620453358
To validate this impression, we conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical course of 33 trauma victims who had had chest tubes placed at the scene of accident.	1.1789317360378422
It was found that 39.4% of the chest tubes were placed completey incorrectly and 21.2% required some correction; 39.4% were placed correctly.	1.2293672070852986
In two cases (6.1%) life-threatening complications developed because of the chest tube, necessitating a thoracotomy in 1 patient and repeated pericardial punction in the other.	1.240677894254872
Based on the results of our study we believe that a more critical attitude should be adopted to the placement of chest tubes at the scene of the accident.	1.1707985442728128
Based upon the observation that some current approaches of quality assurance do not really come up to the specific characteristics of different psychotherapeutic settings, this article discusses quality assurance from the perspective of inpatient group psychotherapy.	1.082116154280923
It differentiates issues of structural quality (e.g.	0.5038198910983062
the importance of the institutional frame, rules for indication, or treatment concepts), process quality with special consideration of problems connected with short term group treatment, and outcome quality, which in order to be assured needs the development of methods which reflect the group setting adequately.	1.305445690443096

In Germany there is still an urgent need for action in regard to screening for breast cancer.	0.9551325925761609
The announcement of research projects for mammography screening proves this.	0.729264329127339
The following reports the results of the Munich field study.	0.8566849350195632
In 2 years, 2489 breast cancer cases were registered (status 6/98).	0.8151750852595736
Screening data were available for 1319 patients.	0.6923721353011758
The reduction in mortality, found in randomized studies, due to mammography in women over 50 years old was confirmed.	0.982789907833769
A relative reduction of 44.8% in 10-year mortality could be estimated through mammography and 25.1% through palpation, in comparison with "doing nothing".	1.2686105881863075
We could also estimate the participation of screening and the used methods in the Munich region.	1.0009307925951485
If the mammographies carried out today were used at 2-year intervals for women aged between 50 and 70 years, then the mammography screening could be performed with no additional costs for 70% of the women.	1.2320510729771197
The known facts regarding the population-based mortality and regarding the acceptance of the palpation screening and frequency of mammography are additional aspects for inclusion in the discussion of what research projects in Germany are and what they should fulfill.	0.9912124219489562
Insufficiency after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is a typical complication.	0.8167796834343026
Between 1 January 1992 and 31 December 1997 a total of 604 operations at the ACL were performed in the traumatology department of Nuremberg hospital.	1.042222828614093
During the same period 48 "transplant failures" were treated.	1.0990462127498366
There were various reasons for the failure of the transplant, some of them technical, occurring during the operation or during aftercare.	1.0763279595259267
Another reason for a re-rupture of the transplant was by trauma.The different reasons for the failure of the transplant were analysed in our patient population.	1.0620962998413885
The 48 patients were classified into five groups depending on the primary operation and the means of treatment (I = ACL sutures, II = artificial ligament, III = semitendinosus tendon, IV and V = ipsi- or contralateral bone-patellar-bone graft harvest after ACL reconstruction), so that the different ways of treatment were better comparable.	1.1854866317703172
Of the 48 patients 36 were followed up over an average of 2 1/2 years using the Lysholm scores and the OAK scores.	1.1324265251956278
The total score of the 36 patients was 81 points and can be valued as good using the evaluation scale of Lysholm and Gillquist.	0.9421622854529503
Using the OAK score we found an average of 71 to 81 points in the different groups; results in the group with the ipsilateral bone-tendon-bone graft harvest after ACL reconstruction were the worst.	1.08055469674717
The totalscore using the OAK score was 74 points and was considered "moderate".	0.7808103153304822
The score results were discussed and compared with the current literature.	0.8778025552907717
In this case report, we focus on the importance of scurvy as a differential diagnosis in a newborn presenting with swollen legs.	0.9928065867872526
Scurvy is rare in highly developed countries and often overlooked.	0.8979885994558903
Medical history, clinical symptoms and radiological findings are crucial for diagnosis.	1.0467857691935794
The diagnosis is confirmed by successful treatment with ascorbic acid.	0.9670854150873278
Hemangiomas of the skull base are rare neoplasms and are easily misdiagnosed as acoustic neuromas when occurring in the internal auditory canal.	1.0148305694038768
Among these tumors, ossifying hemangiomas are characterized histologically be newly formed bone tissue within their substance.	0.749728669973257
We describe a 26-year old female patient who presented with left-sided sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus.	1.1152460485616444
T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a bright space-occupying lesion of the internal auditory canal with extension to the geniculate ganglion.	0.9833388347373295
Bony erosions of the internal auditory canal were proved by high-resolution computed tomography.	0.9428478379439191
A hemangioma was suspected preoperatively and was resected via a middle cranial fossa approach.	0.8737333002242863
Histologically, new bone formations were found in a cavernous hemangioma.	1.348097543950703
In general, radiologic findings can suggest a hemangioma of the internal auditory canal and help to differentiate it from acoustic neuroma.	0.9487361056721842
Based on the histological findings of intratumoral bone formation, the hemangioma in our patient was classified as an ossifying hemangioma.	1.1127969748953097
However, reactive bone formation at the borders of a tumor in the internal auditory canal can also be mistaken as new intratumoral bone formation.	1.1375374799547668
Myocardial ischemia results in myocardial dysfunction.	0.6739754869298807
Recovery may be delayed ("stunning"), or persistent if perfusion remains reduced ("hibernation") and ischemia may go on to necrosis, thus, contributing to chronic heart failure.	1.2767719755573135
In addition, myocardium not directly affected by ischemia may undergo adaptive processes like hypertrophy and dilatation, which may result in chronic left heart failure.	1.143239430794628
This process is characterized by hemodynamic, neurohumoral, and progressive morphologic changes of the heart which are closely interrelated.	1.1027999040478351
Hemodynamic changes basically consist of an increase in left ventricular filling pressure and a decrease in global ejection fraction, and, in most cases years after myocardial infarction, in an increase in systemic vascular resistance and right atrial pressure.	1.1623590781608013
Neurohumoral changes consist of an increase in plasma catecholamines, atrial natriuretic factor and vasopressin, and in an activation of the renin-angiotensin-system.	1.1176781467319634
Plasma endothelin-1 was recently reported to be increased in patients with heart failure, and prognosis was related to endothelin levels.	1.065656052122864
Diminished response of vessels to endothelium (EDRF/NO) dependent vasodilatation suggests impairment of vascular endothelium in heart failure.	0.9403440215249161
Local changes of cardiac neurohumoral systems could contribute to structural changes of the heart, e.g., systemic activation to hemodynamic changes.	1.0420456596791623
Structural changes of the heart are characterized by an increase in volume and thickness of surviving myocardium and an expansion of ischemic and necrotic myocardium.	1.0184520764266078
Molecular control of these processes which include various cell types, such as cardiomyocytes and cardiofibroblasts, are currently an issue of intense research and could result in specific therapeutic importance.	1.0544352899157352
Postoperative infection in the locomotor system may lead to malpractice suits.	0.5762203275742377
The aim of the study was to determine the success rate of these claims and the type of expert-confirmed medical negligence so that strategies for avoiding such negligence can be offered.	0.9453752288513142
A total of 261 decrees concerning suspected malpractice after postoperative infection in the locomotor system were retrospectively evaluated.	0.7987448100651823
Of these, 43.7 % claims were successful.	1.0681999352423355
The most frequent type of negligence was late diagnosis (34.2 %), followed by inconsistant treatment (27.2 %) and insufficient surgical revision (5.3 %).	1.1520923609730789
In 33.3 %, combined types of negligence were found.	1.1393274522207766
Most frequently, negligence was suspected after infection following hand surgery and internal fixation of long bones.	0.9402546595004008
The highest success rate of claims was seen after puncture of joints (69.2 %).	0.9060843650634267
Insufficient documentation was confirmed in 15.3 %.	0.7994671028484331
The majority of negligence resulted from diagnostic and therapeutic doubts, which could be avoided, e. g., by a clear definition of infection, consultation of a second opinion, a 2nd-look operation, undelayed and radical surgical revision, painstaking follow-up and disciplined documentation.	1.1836860249154197
Abstract   Patient satisfaction plays an increasing part in the analysis of the outcome of medical treatment.	1.2142218998588432
The aim of the study was to compare health-related quality of life in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm after endovascular or conventional surgery.	1.0855205349575985
A total of 40 patients were included (20 treated by endovascular and 20 by conventional surgery).	1.148875802629759
A questionnaire with 28 items similar to the SF-36 was answered during scheduled appointments.	0.9019197828147761
On the third postoperative day, the conventionally treated patients were more frequently confined to bed (80% vs. 32%) and complained of intervention-related pain (90% vs. 42%) and incisional pain (26% vs. 15%); 55% of the patients suffered from obstipation (vs. 5% of the endovascular group).	1.0660062339452392
Furthermore, the preoperative psychological stress seemed to be intensified.	1.0375097731607505
In comparable percentage, both the endovascular and conventionally treated patients were limited in social activities perioperatively.	1.0497648080034732
Sexual dysfunction was more frequent in the conventional group (33% vs. 13% three months postoperative).	1.0084665094713037
In addition, the conventionally treated patients were more limited in their physical activities (25% vs. 40%) and had more fear of ambulation (35% vs. 6%).	0.9093484975416314
The patients treated by an endovascular approach complained about frequent examinations (39% vs. 5%) that were often related to X-ray exposure (67% vs. 20%).	1.0519056636002169
All of the conventionally operated patients had a sense of improvement (vs. 89% of the endovascular group); nevertheless only 28% felt completely healthy, compared to 11% of the endovascular treated patients.	1.1530143961567372
Advantages of the endovascular treated patients were "short hospital stay", "decreased pain", "smaller scars", and a "shorter confinement to bed".	1.339628936593631
After intervention the conventionally treated patients were more limited in almost all quality-of-life aspects.	0.8489359581915729
After 3 months, differences between the groups decreased except for sexual dysfunction and limited physical activities.	0.9493132523372464
The patients treated by endovascular surgery complained more about frequent X-ray examinations than the conventionally treated group.	1.0008495319516135
In the majority of ventilated patients endotracheal intubation is required only for a short time period.	0.9985598986380294
However, about 20% of the patients require prolonged mechanical ventilation.	1.3916075427584502
Apart from dysfunction of the central nervous system with a reduced respiratory drive, the vast majority of patients being difficult to wean suffer from either an increased load or a decreased capacity of their respiratory muscles.	1.1083334183572784
Furthermore, beside compromised respiratory mechanics other causes of difficult weaning are, e.g., left heart failure, inadequate sedation, neuropsychiatric issues, malnutrition and aspiration.	1.0671144835481832
The mere application of a consistent weaning strategy (independent from its concrete content) leads to an improved success rate.	0.9455893275502052
In this article three essential aspects of a weaning strategy are dealt with: 1) The concept of interventions (in particular focusing on mechanical ventilation modes unloading respiratory muscles), 2) pathophysiologically based parameters to predict weaning success or failure and 3) organisation of the T-tube trials.	1.14805798526183
A new approach in weaning of long-term ventilated patients is non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NMV).	0.9519582264993033
Compared to invasive mechanical ventilation NMV aims at reducing weaning time, decreasing complication rate and improving prognosis.	0.8574054351554581
Finally, the last section addresses terminal weaning.	0.9755650594467902
The psychoanalytic cure is characterized by a basic antinomy of time and time-lessness.	0.9621697696288642
Freud based the daily psychoanalytic work on the order of the mechanic clock (the time of the machine) to regulate a relationship which is unique in our culture.	1.1342663543307916
The temporal order of the cure responds to the logic of the temporal path.	0.7813310762767293
On the opposite, in the world of the unconscious the familiar concepts of cause and effect as well as of before and after are abolished.	1.257817664559454
"Symmetrical madness" prevails (Matte Blanco).	0.6613712834037463
The temporal core of the analytic situation is bi-logical.	0.7964760828346487
This ambiguity is reflected in the technical principles.	0.727108949538257
Free association breaks through the logic of the temporal path, again and again.	0.8618063064557352
There are, however, different defence strategies defusing its unforeseeability.	1.0491774372955514
The tension between the time that determines the analytic setting and the timelessness of free association gets once again a process of temporal order going.	0.9242052001462517
Present social changes and in connection with them the changed time strategies endanger the temporal order of the analytic cure.	0.8583727121213343
Several historical reports focusing on the heredity of migraine, as well as recent studies on its epidemiology and molecular biology, have revealed evidence for a decisive role of genetic factors in the aetiopathogenesis of familial migraine.	1.0637182727238468
Indeed, family studies, segregation analyses and twin studies have shown that genetic factors play an important role in disposition towards migraine but could not explain the entire aetiopathogenesis.	0.9974162046481521
The influence of extragenetic factors, however, remains mostly unknown.	1.110774122485877
Recent linkage analyses have provided evidence for genetic heterogeneity.	0.7835158179573258
A locus for Familial Hemiplegic Migraine (FHM), the only known type of migraine that follows autosomal-dominant transmission, has been linked to chromosome 19p13 but genetic heterogeneity has also been shown, i. e. different types of migraine could be excluded from this locus.	1.0765759645589146
Further investigations should concentrate on identifying the FHM gene on chromosome 19p13, on linkage analyses with markers for different susceptibility genes, and on genomic analyses of highly informative pedigrees.	1.057361232299815
This would lead to further clues to the pathogenesis underlying migraine and, thus, to therapeutic developments.	1.250472407696223
Radiographic findings suggestive of osteopenia and osteoporosis are frequently encountered in daily medical practice and can result from a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from highly prevalent causes such as postmenopausal and involutional osteoporosis to very rare endocrinologic and hereditary or acquired disorders.	0.8814279080935676
As bone mass is lost, changes in the trabecular and cortical bone structure occur.	0.8708579582618043
The changes that are visible on conventional radiographs may give specific information on the etiology of the underlying disease.	1.0079391800109192
Even though conventional radiography is indispensable in the differential diagnosis of osteopenia and osteoporosis, visual assessment of bone mass and its changes is subjective and strongly depends on the radiographic technique.	1.0093820819497745
With radiogrammetry and radiographic absorptiometry two methods exist that rely on conventional radiography and allow for a quantification of bone mass.	0.853005603467119
This article describes the author's experience during the 1-year AGA Pittsburgh fellowship from 1 April 1996 to 31 March 1997.	0.9930651451369804
The article is focused on the work in the Musculoskeletal Research Center and the Center for Sports Medicine of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery in Pittsburgh.	0.9800636189627135
The author describes projects on the biomechanics of the cruciate ligaments, using robotic technology.	0.9272118059808863

The different subgroups of hypercalciuria cannot be separated clearly by the Pak calcium-load test.	0.6549712264640303
To improve the diagnosis and therapy we examined all relevant parameters of calcium metabolism in 32 patients with calcium urolithiasis and hypercalciuria (> 6.25 mmol/day).	1.183322365186287
We also conducted bone mineral density measurements as well as the Pak calcium-load test.	0.9313901850164966
In most cases the pathophysiological constellations which Pak takes as the basis for his classification of hypercalciuria could not be shown.	1.1491425722800073
To date, diagnostics only insufficiently explains the genesis of hypercalciuria (except pHPT).	0.8158875316907575
As a consequence, a therapeutic problem arises: a low-calcium diet should not be generally recommended, since some patients may develop osteopenia.	1.1739571515220482
From our investigation the following diagnostic and therapeutic conclusions can be drawn: (1) Hypercalciuria in primary hyperparathyroidism should be treated by surgical removal of the adenoma.	1.092323386739482
(2) The parathormone-independent osteogenic form should be treated with thiazides.	1.0700862963379638
(3) Hypercalciuria with increased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D should be treated by low-calcium diet.	0.988719740442117
A 58-year old man with wilson's disease sustained a bilateral spontaneous rupture of the quadriceps tendon.	1.0024390372541467
The histological investigation showed advanced degeneration of tendon structure and cupper deposits.	0.7820520455646043
After tenosuture the patient had complete cure with full range of movement.	0.9830574310285982
We discuss about relation of wilson x s disease, cupper deposits and degenerative changes of tendon tissue.	0.8452312421919863
Within the framework of the National Health Interview and Examination Survey 1998 the Short Form Questionnaire SF-36 has been applied to measure the health related quality of life (HRQOL).	0.9453325328583193
This opened more opportunities than simply creating a new normative sample for the German adult population.	0.8666495624216092
Thus, the very complex interdependence between morbidity, satisfaction, risk factors, health related behaviours, social status, age and sex on the one side and the subjective assessment of health related quality of life on the other hand may be investigated.	1.1626115010710474
First results of the Survey data are presented which open the discussion of the possibilities and limits of the SF-36 instrument for measuring health related quality of life at the population level.	1.0738053735234445
The von Willebrand's Disease affects about 1-3 % of the population and it is undiagnosed in most people.	1.1835423924321629
Originally described by the Finish physician Erik von Willebrand in 1926 this disorder is associated with mucous membran bleeding including epistaxis, hypermenorhoea and excessive bleeding from surgery and dental procedures.	0.8684071818761551
In von Willebrands disease the patients have a quantitative or qualitative abnormality in the von Willebrand Factor (vWF) which has two major functions: it serves by bridging between platelets and injury site in the blood vessel wall, and it circulates as a complex with factor VIII, protecting it from rapid degradation.	1.1728561558621218
More than 20 different types and subtypes of vWD have been described but almost all patients can be classified as having 1 of the 2 most common types of vWD.	1.1394401206079885
About 70 % of patients have type 1 and about 10-20 % present themself with type 2A and 2B vWD type 3 in about 10 %.	1.1021025028177471
By taking a clinical history of bleeding it is important to think about vWD and to make the appropriate diagnosis.	1.0858321974390448
If the vWD is suspected diagnostic tests should include an activated partial thromboplastin time, bleeding time, factor VIII:C, Ristocetin cofactor, and vWF antigen.	0.9253751527396147
Additional testing of ristocetin induced plattlet adhesion (RIPA), the multimeric structure and collagen binding test and gen-analysis allow diagnosing the different types of v. Willebrand Disease.	0.9411749571627105
The treatment of choice in mild forms is the synthetic agent desmopressin.	1.0546814260926909
In patients with severe type 1, type 2B, 2N and type 3 or in people who do not response to desmopressin, the appropriate treatment is a factor VIII concentrate that is rich of vWF.	1.1552995707863132
Until now no recommendations in the orthopaedic literature have been found regarding diagnosis and treatment of vWS patients.	0.9395855956952557
Based on the experience with 43 orthopaedic patients presenting vWD over the last 15 years a contemporary guideline for the successful perioperative management of vWD in orthopaedic surgery is presented.	1.0071784885544797
In a close collaboration between the orthopaedic surgeon and the specialized haemostaseologist every invasive procedure in patients with vWD can be undertaken without the risk of excessive bleeding.	0.9339795461897672
Patients with a prior myocardial infarction (MI) have a high risk of perioperative reinfarction compared with the normal population (5%-8% vs. 0.1%-0.7%) [10].	1.383663092304345
According to Rao [13], a reduction of this risk is possible when patients are monitored invasively and all haemodynamic parameters are kept within the physiological range.	1.0584783531080395
In most institutions it is not feasible to treat patients as Rao recommended: this would overstrain both hospital structure and financial resources.	1.1144216224367671
We studied the incidence of perioperative MI and other cardiac events in patients with prior MI.	1.0361043875363984
During the study period the anaesthesia and intensive care methods of our institution were neither changed nor influenced.	0.8826525719079924
In addition to this clinical evaluation, we performed perioperative Holter electrocardiographic monitoring and measured serum levels of the recently introduced marker troponin T (parts II and III).	1.08240856277653
Small basal cell carcinomas of the trunk are usually regarded as relatively harmless.	0.9552672560832406
In contrast, large and ulcerating basal cell carcinomas may become a therapeutic challenge with a less favourable prognosis and high risk of recurrence.	1.1865885880140938
The development of mutilating giant basal cell carcinomas appears less due to the biological aggressive character of the tumors, but rather to the patients' attitude of neglect.	1.104724877451131
The case of a 62-year-old patient, featuring such attitude, demonstrates how a common basal cell carcinoma of the trunk can grow over a period of years to a troublesome ulcerating tumor.	1.0036332709213571
This epidemiologic, retrospective follow-up mortality study is based on the data gathered in the department of forensic medicine at the University Hospital of Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt/Main.	1.0470233765406753
Over a period of 21 years (1972-1992), roughly 21,000 forensic autopsies revealed 39 cases (0.19%) of natural deaths occuring during sexual activity.	1.186398922024366
Except for two women, all of these cases were men of an average age of 61.3 years.	1.2869424611186533
The most frequent cause of death was myocardial infarction (n=21/53.8%), three of these cases involving pericardial tamponade accompanied by myomalacia.	1.2045077645408873
The medical history of twelve of the deceased showed a previous myocardial infarction.	0.9559868079635317
Most of the deaths took place during or after sexual intercourse or manual stimulation.	0.9019011414953723
In most cases sudden death occured during the sexual act with a prostitute.	0.8679624839990054
The annual incidence of sudden cardiovascular deaths during sexual activity is estimated to be 0.2/100,000 men.	1.0872749518388805
The risk for women is lower by a factor of 12.	0.966125188192319

Spreading depression is a fascinating phenomenon that can be provoked by chemical, electrical or mechanical stimuli of the cortex.	0.8774928242402997
Spreading depression-like transient depolarizations are observed in the periinfarct tissue after focal ischemia.	0.8462519983028608
The reduction in electrical activity and a negative direct current potential shift propagating over the cortex with a rate of 2-5 mm/minute are the physiological hallmarks.	1.0813877101216942
It is thought that spreading depression and peri-infarct depolarizations might play a role in the pathogenesis of migraine and stroke.	0.7597452512137448
However, these events have never been detected in humans.	1.241192400195892
This paper reviews the physiological characteristics of spreading depression and peri-infarct depolarizations and discusses their potential role in migraine and stroke.	0.7925210992507422

Pectoralis major flaps were found to be more difficult to handle and were used in those cases in which the application of free radial forearm flaps was expected to produce higher risks.	1.0685316337211448
Psychotherapists have the alternative, to design quality assurance within certain boundaries by themselves, or otherwise leave this important task to external instances.	1.0486632794622799
Those will apply their own criteria in developing a concept.	0.7669910271143703
This paper discusses the question, how far quality assurance in the field of analytic psychotherapy has to accept the definitions and concepts from other fields such as industry or somatic medicine, without changing or deteriorating the quality that in the end should be improved.	1.0045032978284987
Differentiation is necessary between the use of the Psy-BaDo for individual quality assurance of the individual psychotherapist and for quality- and psychotherapy-research.	1.144905003032463
This paper points out new approaches to modifying the present concept of quality assurance for the purposes of analytic psychotherapy.	0.8596022004065967
Cicatrical pemphigoid (CP) comprises a groupf of patients with a chronic subepidermal blistering disease which primarily involves mucous membranes; lesions characteristically heal with scarring.	0.9212668750833584
Immunofluorescence investigations typically demonstrate deposits of tissue bound and circulating immunoreactants of the IgG and less frequently of the IgA class in a linear pattern along the basement membrane zone.	0.8338538970984122
These autoantibodies are thought to play an important role in the blister formation of CP.	0.6913379695716049
Most patients show binding to the bullous pemphigoid antigen 2 (BPag2), collagen type XVII, with a molecularweight of 180 kD.	1.2208973429315986
A smaller group of patients with CP have autoantibodies to laminin 5.	0.8617642672227177
Animal models confirm that autoantibodies binding to these two adhesion molecules (BPag2 and laminin 5) are important in blister formation.	1.11004081303289
There are other autoantigens described in CP; however, they are only found in small groups of CP patients and most of them are not further characterised.	1.1396620877492902
The described molecules are part of the hemidesmosomal adhesion complex.	0.6609047600571386
Impaired function of any component of this complex may lead to a separation of the epidermis from the dermis; better knowledge about the single molecules and the exact localisation of epitopes within these molecules may lead to further understanding of the clinical picture.	1.1041704142997744
Study objective: The clinical effect of ketoprofen is based not only on the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.	1.0776311364821907
Ketoprofen also acts through kynurenic acid as a central antagonist on the NMDA receptor.	0.780381647271796
Due to this central analgesic mechanism of ketoprofen, we expected an analgesic preemptive effect.	0.9999560072030422
This study was carried out following the Breivik/Stubhaug preemptive effect study design.	0.8510648888101747
Dystopies of the bony orbit are caused mainly by craniosynostosis, facial clefts and encephaloceles.	0.9409527007194421
This article presents the results of the surgical correction of orbital hypertelorism in 24 patients.	0.9853325359636089
Using this operation technique, the bony interorbital distance was decreased from an average of 47.6 mm to 22.8 mm.	1.0911265022134073
However, the distance between the soft tissues was not reduced by the same amount as the distance between the bony orbits.	1.0918780674477022
The intercanthal distance decreased from an average of 58.5 mm to 44.5 mm, whereby an additional refixation of the medial palpebral ligament resulted in a reduction of the intercanthal distance to 40.8 mm.	1.1629797705131033
A strabismus divergens was seen preoperatively in 18 patients, postoperatively only in 8 patients.	1.001666290794735
Four of the latter had to undergo operative correction of the diplopia.	1.0449888217428462
We conclude that the operative technique is not reserved only for complex cases of hypertelorism because it shows satisfactory functional and aesthetic results with a low complication rate.	1.1596835505680683
Four years after extensive pneumonectomy on the left side with resection of the aortic wall and patch reconstruction for a T4 carcinoma, 2 years after adjuvant radiation and 10 months after drainage therapy of late intrathoracic empyema, destruction of the infected Dacron patch led to rupture of the aorta descendens.	1.140422137521387
Successful primary emergency reconstruction of the aorta descendens was followed by venetian blind plasty (Heller) and transposition of the omentum majus for omentoplasty of the aortal wall and reduction of the pneumonectomy cavity.	0.9586378985333646
The rate of prosthetic infections is between 0.3 and 2.5% and must be taken into consideration even in cases of intrathoracic vascular reconstruction with alloplastic prostheses.	1.2691241426016808
After lung resection it is necessary to cover up the prosthetic graft by using autogenous material to obtain prosthetic incorporation into the protective tissue.	0.9277389613747876
In intrathoracic infectious complications, extra-anatomic bypass grafting or autogenous vascular graft implantation should be considered.	0.8094961490759942
If there is no possibility of carrying out these procedures, first aggressive local debridement of the infected vascular wall and afterwards coverage with alloplastic prosthetics with omentum transposition and thoracoplasty are essential to minimize postoperative infection and obtain solid anchorage in the surrounding tissue.	0.934266155289246
The evaluation of melanocytic tumors represents one of the most intriguing and challenging aspects of the daily practice in dermatohistopathology.	1.0845164598992723
For the diagnosis of malignant melanoma and melanocytic nevi, standardized and reproducible criteria are required.	0.9971768185103114
In case of the diagnosis of melanoma, the histopathological report must include all important data relevant for the prognosis which may also influence the therapeutic procedure.	1.1595686062388475
The following paper summarizes the recommendations of the study group on malignant melanoma formed by the Deutsche Dermatologische Gesellschaft.	1.0248694006686858
Recent studies have shown that acute infections, especially of the respiratory tract, are an important risk factor for cerebral ischemia.	1.0905299519981826
Additionally we know that chronic dental infections may be a risk for myocardial infarction and artherosclerosis.	1.002569704230286
However, the connection between stroke and dental infections has hardly been examined so far.	0.9970370959132088
Therefore we performed a case-control study using a standardized questionaire and examination.	1.0362182241944176
We investigated 66 patients consecutive to a acute cerebral ischemia/stroke and 60 age- and sex-matched nonstroke neurological patients as a control group.	0.921893497887919
Dental status was determined by a so called total dental index (TDI) which reflects primarily caries, periodontitis, periapical lesions, devital and missing teeth as well as by a panoramic index (PI).	0.9828589696051402
Specifically, older patients with cerebrovascular ischemia tended to have a significantly worse dental status and had more severe periodontitis and periapical lesions than control subjects.	0.9943692520397125
A predefined poor dental status was associated with cerebrovascular ischemia independent from other vascular risk factors and social status.	0.9594987819618599
In conclusion, poor dental health, mainly resulting from chronic dental infections, may be associated with an increased risk for cerebrovascular ischemia.	1.108439877331717
The results must now be verified in larger studies.	0.7091663426719687
As chronic dental infections are a common and also easily treatable factor, their identification as a risk factor for stroke would be quite important in the field of preventive medicine.	1.0431333583423288
Adjuvant basic therapy plays a central role  in the therapeutic approach to atopic eczema in childhood.	1.2705513370328019
It involves the regular use of emollients and oil baths according to the clinical picture.	0.9329775624047437
Emollients containing urea may cause problems when used in younger children due to their stinging effect.	0.93745897155773
Glucocorticosteroids still form the mainstay  of anti-inflammatory therapy and are superior to other topical drugs with anti-inflammatory effects.	1.0103360442534297
Antihistamines preferably of the sedative type can be used successfully  during periods of exacerbation.	0.9354876737128888
Systemic use of antibiotics is essential in cases of impetiginized atopic eczema.	0.9999844915182157
In cases of bacterial-triggered eczema, the topical use of antibiotics in cases of limited or of antiseptics in generalized disease may be helpful.	1.06100087753089
The present paper presents data obtained over a 12 year period, on the matrix synthesis and turnover in some 650 arthritic and 180 non-arthritic (N) human cartilages using a standardised in vitro method.	1.129198415653364
When the relative metabolic (synthetic/repair activity) of these human cartilages was compared, it was demonstrated that in osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) cartilages synthetic activity was diminished by approximately 50% as compared with N cartilages.	1.1370340436993718
However, the turnover rate of matrix was not significantly different between Non-arthritic and OA, but was very substantially increased in RA cartilages compatible with the activity of inflammatory cells and proteolytic enzymes released from pannus.	1.1254152644065551
The action of 13 NSAIDs was compared in terms of their effect on cartilage GAG synthesis.	0.7247278485446612
3 of these NSAIDs were also studied in terms of their effect on cartilage collagen synthesis.	0.7892101262995626
Consideration of the results in this study and from published material, led to the suggestion that NSAIDs may be divided into 3 categories in respect of their in vitro action on the extracellular matrix of human arthritic cartilages:   1.	1.2206287019451456
Those such as Aceclofenac, Tenidap and Tolmetin which can stimulate matrix synthesis 2.	0.8230070844514136
Those such as Piroxicam, Tiaprofenic Acid and Aspirin which appear to be without significant effect on matrix synthesis and, 3.	0.916305428613488
Those like Naproxen, Ibuprofen, Indomethacin, Nimezulide which significantly inhibit matrix synthesis.	0.8347698960626256
It is suggested that the stimulatory action of group 1 NSAID is due to inhibition of locally produced IL1 and consequent expression of growth factor activity.	0.8472919341009352
Other NSAIDs may also inhibit IL1 synthesis or release, but probably do not have a beneficial effect on chondrocyte synthetic activity as they have toxic effects on cartilage metabolism.	1.0021129514780664
These experiments led to the suggestion that NSAIDs such as Aceclofenac would be appropriate for long-term treatment of arthritic conditions provided that one is prepared to extrapolate between in vitro experiments on human cartilage and what may be happening in vivo.	0.9317958613330174
The article begins with a general introduction to the problems of pre-operative anxiety and its impact on the post-operative course development.	0.974258777179758
Then the treatment of a patient who developed an anxiety-syndrome before a necessary heart operation is described.	1.2171412817068932
The treatment lasted 6 hours and included psychotherapy by guided affective imagery.	0.7319067763276759
One and a half years later a follow-up interview was carried out by a colleague of the original therapist.	1.046062870083559
The interview was based on the assumption that patients are able to give a competent statement about their previous treatment.	0.9568075685847552
The results are discussed under the aspect of therapeutic factors of psychotherapy.	0.932362809086183
Physiologically, angiogenesis in adults is a controlled process which plays a role, for example, in wound healing.	1.0181636767434534
Pathological angiogenesis is observed in tumor formation and represents a multifactorial process, in which specific angiogenic factors, as well as growth factors, extracellular matrix proteins and cell adhesion molecules are involved.	1.0102394233109155
Tumor growth is characterized by an imbalance in favor of angiogenic over angiogenesis-inhibiting factors.	0.9039005511005938
Some of the most frequently examined angiogenic factors are vascular endothelial growth factor, acidic/basic fibroblast growth factors and the platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor.	1.0568595795947637
The most important angiogenesis inhibitors are angiostatin and thrombospondin.	0.8134984606384796
To date, the clinical relevance of tumor angiogenesis has been shown for several human tumors.	1.2176676636086117
For most urological tumors, the grade of tumor vessel formation, measured as microvessel density, has been associated with metastases, tumor growth and clinical course.	1.1154748164913735
The prognostic value of this feature of malignant growth seems to be higher than that of most of the classical and newer prognostic factors.	1.00873111805751
Systematic investigations of tumor angiogenesis are becoming increasingly relevant for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies and offer opportunities for the development of new specific therapeutic approaches in clinical oncology.	1.1340045307729987
Introduction: CPR is an essential part of resuscitation.	1.2599369882728217
German medical students must take part in at least two low-level basic life support courses, one for a driver's license and one for admission to medical school.	1.0407239336502097
The knowledge and skill of German medical students in CPR performance were studied.	0.8381969972647062
Psychoanalysis is regarded to be mainly disorderoriented.	0.6859582339638448
Indeed, since its beginning, it was characterised by the two-sided orientation towards disorder and resources.	1.3357748121295179
Contemporary concepts of the psychoanalytic encounter, especially actualgenetic conceptions of the analysis of transference, lay the ground for better integrating both aspects.	0.9653228278557371
This development implies new approaches to the psychoanalytic process and technique, and especially to interpretation.	1.1283308517163262
More than before, contemporary psychoanalytic interpretation refers to progressive coping strategies within and outside transferential processes.	0.7968072498455818
During the last few decades, traumatic injuries of the hip joint have significantly increased in number, and traffic accidents have also increased.	1.2223966008859106
Depending on the speed, direction of the forces and the position of the femur at the moment of impact, different patterns of injury occur.	1.123557777956854
Basically, they are classified as hip dislocations, dislocation fractures and acetabular fractures.	1.104262293131743
These injuries have in common a high rate of concomitant lesions.	0.8745578554516995
Several classification systems have been developed for these injuries.	0.9638076803812907
Commonly, Stewart and Milford's or Levin's classification is used for dislocations and dislocation fractures.	0.8272723488100134
For acetabular fractures, Judet and Letournel's classification and its newer version developed by Helfet (AO classification) are generally accepted.	0.9042652808715205
Fractures of the femoral head, though included in these classifications, are typically described by separate classifications like the one presented in 1957 by Pipkin.	1.0627932883356561
The multitude of injuries occuring in the hip joint requires vast knowledge of various operative approaches.	0.9403540679268101
No single approach exists that would permit the treatment of all injuries in an ideal fashion.	1.0502572976027211
Approaches are either considered limited (Kocher-Langenbeck, ilioinguinal iliofemoral) when they permit access only to a restricted segment of the joint, or extended (extended iliofemoral, Maryland, Ruedi) when they allow all-around visualization of the hip joint.	0.9655093790799129
The choice of the best approach for an individual patient depends on the type of injury and also on patient variables like age, preexisting disease, and concomitant injuries.	1.166740042829249
The decision is further influenced by the timing of surgery, the kind of fracture stabilization intended and by complications typically seen with certain approaches.	0.9458714319772817
The indication for extended procedures is only seen in patients with complex injury patterns involving both the anterior and the posterior column or in delayed cases undergoing surgery more than 3 weeks after trauma.	1.1149135928117875
Extended approaches permit excellent visualization of the fracture, but the extent of the soft tissue trauma is reflected in a high rate of postoperative complications.	1.351577264643821
After a phase in which extended procedures were favored, recently a trend towards more limited approaches can be recognized because of their lower complication rate.	0.942432347379098
This is facilitated by modern fracture-reduction methods using indirect techniques.	0.7439357917601351
A relation between myocardial ischemia and induction of ventricular arrhythmias can be demonstrated in patients with coronary heart disease - in contrast to patients with primary non ischemic cardiac diseases - using a combined metabolic-electrophysiological investigation protocol consisting of programmed atrial and ventricular stimulation with simultaneous measurement of the arterio/coronary venous difference for lactate, pyruvate, free fatty acids and amino acids.	1.1406985144407016
There are significant metabolic distinctions between both ischemic and non ischemic heart disease under pacing stress conditions as well as at rest.	0.8799751022492531
A 52 year old female with Parry-Romberg syndrome presented with gradual atrophy of the subcutaneous fat and muscle on her chest and back.	0.9699893793663816
The disease process was limited to the C3 to T2 dermatomes on the right side.	0.8521535516565325
In addition, there was muscle atrophy of the right arm and extending down the back to T10, als well as right sided paralysis of the diaphragm.	1.1538083826789387
Sympathetic nerve blockage reduced pain and hyperesthesia; no progression was seen over several months using NMR to monitor the patient.	0.9085863732292019
The Parry-Romberg syndrome has been defined in many ways; in view of this unusual case, we review the literature, attempting to provide a more accurate case definition.	1.1299532939521761
Between 1990 and 1996, 129 children (mean age 4.8 years) with hip pain were examined consecutively.	1.1948709256048513
In group I (n = 100, mean age 4.14  +/-  2.2), transient synovitis of the hip was diagnosed; group II (n = 29, mean age 7.3  +/-  2.1) showed the following diagnoses: Perthes' disease (n = 12), early slipped capital femoral epiphysis (n = 5), Meyer's dysplasia (n = 2), septic arthritis of the hip (n = 2), osteomyelitis of the acetabulum (n = 1), abscess of the psoas (n = 1), chondromatosis of the hip joint (n = 1), Ewing's sarcoma of the os pubis (n = 1), hip dysplasia (n = 1).	1.3295311002208854
Three patients who had synovitis developed Perthes' disease and were assigned to group II.	0.945531969997151
The efficiency of ultrasound, scintigraphy and MRI as diagnostic tools was tested in the examination of painful hip.	0.9677503524746117
A capsular distension was present in 73 cases and showed a significant statistical difference (t-test, P < 0.001) in group I between affected and unaffected hips.	0.9973120539067011
There were no differences in the measurements of the epiphyseal and metaphyseal width in group I between the affected and the non-affected side (t-test, P = 0.91, P = 0.57) and between the first sonographic evaluation at presentation and at the follow-up (t-test, P = 0.053, P = 0.75).	1.0702187224585402
MRI was performed, because of persistent joint effusion, in 10 cases in group I, and Perthes' disease was excluded.	1.289858431083215
In group II the use of an MRI allowed the diagnosis in 89 % of the cases.	1.170659376777431
Sonographic examination, together with X-ray examination and serological testing, represent the first choices in the evaluation of a painful hip at presentation and in the follow-up of transient synovitis.	1.0948443845575062
MRI should always be performed when abnormalities are present at the clinical and sonographic examination, and when the X-ray does not allow a clear diagnosis.	1.0419477844659037
A 36-year old woman was presented to our hospital with congenital ventricular septal defect and one-vessel coronary artery disease (75% proximal left main coronary artery) for CABG and repair of the VSD.	1.1538969311428589
After induction, a transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) baseline examination was performed, showing a severely dilated coronary sinus (CS) measuring approximately 3 cm (abnormal >1 cm).	0.9800488013564834
We suggested a persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC) draining into the CS.	0.8203471951287497
PLSVC is a common venous congenital anomaly, with a reported incidence of 0.5% in general population and in 3-5 % of patients with congenital heart defect.	1.4980898625671866
Injection of echo-contrast solution in a left arm vein, visualizing microbubbles passing through the PLSVC into the CS confirmed our suspicion.	0.8284202917929278
The diagnosis of a PLSVC and dilated CS is a contraindication for retrograde cardioplegia because of the loss of cardioplegia into the PLSVC resulting in a inadequate myocardial protection.	0.9367396804225031
It may be difficult to pass a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) through a left internal or left subclavian vein and it may be associated with arrythmias.	0.9918589363158161
A chest radiograph shows the anomalous course of the PAC along the left heart.	1.0035890136458012
Teleradiologysystems can differ considerably in their features.	0.6725266018708744
The most important differences lie in the mode of image data acquisition, data transfer, data safety aspects and the possibilities of interaction between seperate teleradiology units.	1.141686047510779
A selection of commercially available teleradiologysystems is presented and compared.	0.7400272368121619
Craniopharyngiomas are the third frequent pediatric brain tumors.	0.7238354891620105
Complications after surgical treatment are common.	0.7984846242072949
The most frequent complications are endocrine disturbances, vision field defects, deteriorated acuity, cognitive or psychological deficiency as well as significant weight gain.	1.0824858198463647
A case of complete vision loss right after surgical removal of craniopharyngioma is reported.	0.9076631667338784
Magnetic resonance image showed an edema of the chiasm.	0.7313922776508363
No damage of anatomical structure could be detected.	0.7622061289170062
Seventeen days after surgery the patient reported intermittent  visual impressions for the first time.	0.9576442593241941
Over the following weeks his visus improved to  0.5, while the chiasm edema disappeared.	1.2618196893318874
Electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) allows viszalization and quantification of calcium in the coronary arteries.	0.7957798711267452
This has been demonstrated to correlate well with the overall plaque burden in the coronary arteries.	1.057895086525989
EBCT is, therefore, well suited for the detection of early stages of coronary atherosclerosis.	0.9182124842263962
Especially in asymptomatic patients with several risk factors, staging coronary artery disease by coronary calcium, scanning may allow prognostic assessment and guide preventive and therapeutic interventions.	0.9279756484588645
We report an unusual complication in a 53-year-old woman following ileostomy for Crohn's disease 22 years previously.	1.0393700904218108
A stenosis of the distal colonic segment was the reason for the formation and subsequent rupture of a huge colonic mucocele.	1.0437272324747973
To our knowledge, this is the first report of a ruptured mucocele of colonic origin after ileostomy.	0.8160360877942894
The brain is an important target organ for gonadal hormones.	0.8629604681573725
Estrogens have protective and trophic effects on neural systems and modulate the activity of several neurotransmitter systems.	0.8027292561808953
Initial studies support the hypothesis that estrogen therapy in menopause may have protective effects toward the development of dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease.	1.0074853151600587
Furthermore, estrogens may improve verbal fluency, memory, and mood in elderly women.	1.2288981843038596
Still, the available evidence is not sufficient to support general treatment recommendations with respect to estrogens and the therapeutic targets dementia and depression.	1.133842571252552
A 38-year-old male patient presented with circumscribed scleroderma (10x12 cm) in the left pectoral area.	1.0038433786463132
Hyperaemia of the skin in the area of the lilac ring (morphoea) was quantified by means of Laser-Doppler flux (LDF).	1.0559454877115173
At the lilac border of the morphoea LDF was increased to 420% of the reference value recorded for the unaffected skin of the contralateral side.	1.1264399555396971
Immediately after 13 days of antibiotic therapy (3x10 Mega penicillin G per day, i.v.)	0.9361216259228138
LDF normalized, though clinical changes were hardly apparent at this stage.	0.880323793508012
By 6 months later, LDF was still in the normal range, and clinical signs, such as induration and hyperaemic redness, had also significantly improved.	0.9458590254857743
LDF measurements allow assessment of the therapeutic response to antibiotic therapy at a very early stage while the clinical situation is still unchanged.	1.0711295706352668
It is generally accepted that the progression of an idiopathic scoliotic deformity with a Cobb angle of between 25  ° and 40  ° can be stopped by brace treatment alone provided that the generally acknowledged criteria for the treatment concerning skeletal growth of the individual are respected.	1.1179231266293495
The total costs for a department of anaesthesia amount to a fraction of the total hospital budget that is proportional to the overall number of hospital departments; this means anaesthetic departments are in general not cost drivers.	1.033272393836805
The medical treatment of erectile dysfunction includes the systemic (oral, epidermal, intramuscular) as well as the local (intracavernosal, intraurethral) application of pharma cological agents.	1.0635872660731587
Up to now only yohimbine, a well-known alpha-receptor blocking agent, and sildenafil, a newly introduced phosphodiesterase V inhibitor with predominant peripheral action, have been approved and listed in Germany.	1.150331196502668
Other oral agents under investigation are trazodone and apomorphine (central action) as well as phentolamine (peripheral action).	0.8059863394051162
For the small group of patients with an established testosterone deficit, the epidermal or intramuscular substitution of testosterone seems to be a reasonable alternative to other therapeutic options.	1.2230056891446184
For the local application of pharmacological agents, intracavernosal injection therapy and intraurethral application ("medicated urethral system for erection", MUSE) are available.	1.1810015678696693
Currently, several promising pharmacological agents with different modes of action and routes of administration are under investigation.	1.0191175453439414
The ultimate goal of these basic and clinical research efforts is to develop a specific and "tailored" therapy for each individual patient.	1.1707580507147286
While the pharmacological therapy of erectile dysfunction will most likely continue to be the therapeutic standard for most patients, it will certainly be augmented by devices (i. e. vacuum erection devices, "functional electromyostimulation of the corpus cavernosum", FEMCC) and surgical treatment options (vascular and prosthetic surgery).	1.2475988126703625
We treated a large superficial basal cell carcinoma (ca.	0.8748570142511215
10x6 cm) on the right breast in a 48-year old woman with photodynamic terapy (PDT).	1.0963980094723835
Fractionated PDT was performed by topical application of -aminolevulinic acid (-ALA, 20%) with subsequent red light (570-750 nm; 180 J/cm2) in three sessions.	1.2346202187812978
Nearly total remission of the tumor resulted; however, a few residual neoplastic islands partly infiltrating the nipple-areola complex could be detected by photodynamic diagnosis (PDD).	1.0698857751590396
These fluorescent areas were marked, excised, and the defect was closed by a rotation advancement flap.	1.1223434743871656
Total excision of the tumor was verified histologically.	1.1955640952205362
By combining PDT and surgery, this large tumor was treated with excellent cosmetic results.	0.9223303696617375
This case demonstrates the efficiency of topical PDT with adjunctive plastic surgery controlled by PDD even in large tumors.	0.873628421151941
In a prospective trial patients were interviewed in two periods, from 1988 to 1990 and from 1993 to 1995.	1.1888811197563511
Ninety out of 189 patients (47,6%) with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of malignant melanoma who noted morphological changes in a pigmented lesion reported the mole had been present at least 10 years.	1.1024967845575968
20,7% stated it was present since birth.	1.0472226439125454
156 out of 189 patients (82,5%) noticed changes in the lesion over the time.	1.0356608106114402
Growth, discolouration and elevation were the most frequent changes but no significant early sign of disease was found.	1.0181827667804415
Bleeding and crusting were found with tumor thickness >1,5 mm and thus be signs of an advanced stage.	1.1404209734562185
Almost 6 months passed until half of the patients visited a physician, either because of changes in the mole or in the lesion was detected during other medical examinations.	1.1721819141673873
In the second period of the survey from 1993 to 1995 the physician was frequently consulted earlier.	1.07798253063586
The main reasons for the delay between identification by the patient and seeking medical cedure were lack of symptoms and the notion that the lesion was harmless.	1.0651844670598731
Only 72 out of 189 patients (38,1%) visited the physician on their own initiative.	1.087826216033448
The primary evaluation of the "pigmental lesion" was done by a primary care physician in 57%, by a dermatologist in 32% and by others in 11% of our cases.	1.2827675886004521
A diagnosis of a non-melanoma was made and no further steps were initiated by 27% of the primary care physicians and 22,7% of the surgeons, gynecologists or internists.	1.2760233130264267
Only 5% of the dermatologists misdiagnosed the lesions.	1.1056364459314625
In the second trial period from 1993 to 1995 in all physician groups the rate of misdiagnosis increased due to changes in heathcare services in the context of privatisation in our health care system in East Germany.	1.0300311146355288
Whereas 83,2% of the patients first evaluated by dermatologists had a surgical removal of the mole within the first 2 months after consultation, the proportion for those diagnosed by non-dermatologists was only 58,5%.	1.1435106556221064
The rate of primary treatment by surgeons, often with a small safety margin, also increased.	1.1160408810181854
In 45 patients with Parkinson's disease, we investigated coping behavior and its correlations to demographic and disease-related data, locus of control, depression, and psychosocial adaptation.	1.0100451461672029
Active, problem oriented, and self-reorganizing strategies were predominantly used and regarded as especially helpful by the 27 men and 18 women (age: 56 years; duration of illness: 9 years).	1.04529148139951
While age and sex were not associated with coping, external locus of control correlated positively to "depressive coping" and duration of illness correlated negatively to "distraction and self-affirmation."	0.9664652388392795
Coping strategies regarded as maladaptive and a small degree of internal locus of control correlated to unfavourable results for depression and satisfaction.	0.9368459352820449
The Internet has become a powerful, international source for information, and it has shown an exponential growth because of the ease of access and the immediate availability of information.	1.048332871991024
We introduced a new ophthalmological atlas including ICD coding on the World Wide Web.	0.7991268504479294
So far, more than 500 lantern slides of typical and interesting ophthalmological findings have been selected and digitized.	1.013971891062293
These pictures were integrated in a data base, which was arranged for ease and speed of search and retrieval.	1.0518726347622014
In its background, the data base contains a list of over 4700 ICD-encoded diagnoses to which the picture-documented findings are linked.	1.069544296944269
Comments on pictures can be added by the author or by users.	0.7192125382105481
The data base contains several lists, such as a list of ICD codes and diagnoses, a list of all pictures with corresponding diagnoses, a list of all diagnoses and number of picture, a list of those diagnoses for which the corresponding picture is available, as well as a list of comments on each picture.	1.0650584926526834
Special program scripts handle the user's search key words for diagnoses and extract the required information out of the data base, using Windows NT.	1.012937129228841
Search results are presented on an automatically built-up webpage.	0.9064502557883193
To provide fast speed of search all pictures initially are shown in a small format (thumbnails) with little amount of data.	1.0650326883510581
The related full-size picture is retrieved by a single mouse click.	0.8516463656084812
Moreover, the name and institution of the author, diagnostical hints and comments on pictures by the author or by users are offered for each diagnosis available.	0.9391692368629092
The Giessen Ophthalmological Picture Atlas can be reached in the Internet.	0.8506054311008611
It allows a fast search free of charge from all over the world and, therefore, offers an additional option to obtain specific ophthalmological information for various purposes.	1.0665284682009784
Even though the function of the myometrium is vital for the existence of all mammals, there is little knowledge about its ultrastructure.	1.0618636961789867
So far, only the contractile filaments actin and myosin have been identified.	1.0562703734461458
There is no evidence for the existence of other filament systems, either my means of electron microscopy or histochemically.	1.0743541433353327
The indications, operative procedure, postoperative complications and advantages of laparoscopic ileostomy and colostomy as compared with "open" enterostomy are described and demonstrated in our own patients with Crohn's disease.	1.099533163615452
Major indications for laparoscopic enterostomy in patients with Crohn's disease are stenosis, fecal incontinence and complex anal fistulas in those with severe Crohn's proctitis.	0.9185347816187421
Most Crohn patients tolerate laparoscopic enterostomy and an increasing number demand this minimally invasive technique.	0.8971114541903374
The period of convalescence is much shorter and complications in connection with laparotomy are minimized.	0.8918141776277553
We report on a complete longitudinal rupture of the urethra in combination with a rupture of the pubic symphysis and pelvic fracture during spontaneous vaginal delivery.	1.1338517897996203
Only after stabilisation of the pelvic fracture by external skeletal fixation adaptation of the urethra was possible.	1.0238104665073509
Three weeks later after removing of the transurethral catheter a mild stress incontinence could be observed.	0.8434576904574463
In the follow up one year later the patient was completely continent.	1.2939747083429585
The cosmetic result was satisfactory.	0.5973205924162737
An unclear haematuria after delivery needs a meticulous urological examination.	0.6971839203252717
Early repair of urethral disruption minimize the risk of severe incontinence.	0.8127817503950016
Coordinated care between the trauma surgeon and urologist is required for successful treatment of this rare combined injury after birth.	0.9856934291981118
The increased consumption of "ecstasy" (MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine) has also increased the number of life-threatening intoxications.	1.253423066868078
From a Medline search of the years 1992-1996, reports were registered and evaluated.	0.9365310163558657
Besides cerebral, cardiorespiratory, renal, and hepatic symptoms, hyperthermia syndromes such as malignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, or the serotonin syndrome were common.	1.1220463784457646
In addition to a discussion of the intoxication symptoms and their acute and intensive-care therapy, the psychological and physiological effects of "ecstasy" will be described.	1.0863202869491377
Some historical considerations of the topic are included in this review.	1.0529685791231636
The goal of this prospective, randomised and double-blind pilot-study was to investigate the analgesic potency and the side-effects of tramadol enantiomers in clinical practice.	1.0544049049322024
One hundred patients recovering from orthopaedic surgery with a postoperative pain intensity of more than 50 on a visual analogue scale 0-100 mm (Table 1) were recruited for the study.	1.1681566814745248
They were treated in a randomised, double-blind way with a maximal dose of 150 mg i.v.	0.8511815264480574
(+)-, (-)-tramadol, racemate, or 15 mg i.v.	1.275383152676757
morphine or saline in the placebo group (5 groups, 20 patients each).	1.0625922248533377
The primary criterium of efficacy was the number of responders defined as patients with a pain reduction of at least 20 on VAS after 40 min.	1.0068156090688145
In case of pain, responders were allowed to continue with the double-blind drug up to six hours.	0.9603681272820964
The non-responders were treated with morphine as the rescue analgesic.	0.9860410971938444
The secondary criterium was the incidence and severity of side-effects.	0.880561061370284
Six patients terminated the study prematurely.	0.6155892824256729
One patient was excluded because of an allergic reaction to morphine, one patient could not be treated sufficiently with morphine, four were excluded because of protocol violations.	1.1401036127646134
There were 8 responders in the (+)-tramadol-, 6 in the (-)-tramadol- and 6 in the racemate group, 16* (P<0,05) in the morphine group, and 5 in the placebo group.	1.348120252562014
Pain intensity after 40 min was reduced by 20 (p<0,05), 17 (p<0,05), 17 (p<0,05), 36 (p<0,01 vs placebo, p<0,05 vs (+)-, (-)-tramadol, and racemate group) and 5 mm on the VAS in the (+)-, (-)-, (+/-)-tramadol-, morphine- and placebo-group, respectively.	1.3594330667844687
Thirty eight adverse events like nausea, vomiting, PCO2-increase, and urinary retention occurred in 20 patients, most frequently in the (+)-tramadol- and morphine group.	1.0506885598846
Sedation was significantly less profound in the (-)-tramadol group 1-4 h postoperatively.	1.315537921315678
There were no side-effect in the tramadol racemate group.	1.1437393993772618
The enantiomers were equal to the racemate in analgesic potency, but inferior by far to morphine.	0.9748353687266134
They showed more adverse events and, hence, can not be preferred to the racemate in postoperative pain therapy.	1.029425870348751
A 36-year-old man known as chronic alcohol abuser presently suffered from arthralgia and showed bilateral petriefied kidneys by sonography and computed tomography.	0.9273331492820864
Because of an unclear renal failure a kidney biopsy was performed and presented typical chronic renal oxalosis with massive oxalate crystal deposits, tubular atrophy and interstitital fibrosis.	0.9782777850822477
Since the man had never shown signs of hyperoxaluria in his life before, a secondary oxalosis was supposed.	0.9523943934958792
The subsequently prompted exploration established a three to four times abuse of rocket fuel with cola lemonade 12 years before during the patient's army time as a marine soldier.	0.9437274941247916
Such fuels contain ethylene glycol (glysantin) as antifreeze commonly known to cause in toxic doses acute renal tubular necrosis with hyperoxaluria.	0.9915313668438024
The presented case, however, suggests a rare sublethal ethylene glycol poisoning with initial renal tubular damage, oxalate crystal deposition and subsequent chronic interstitial oxalate nephritis with tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis and chronic renal failure.	1.0344176232005722
Undergoing chronic hemodialysis, the patient died 5 months after the kidney biopsy diagnosis by acute heart failure.	1.2619199698037329
At autopsy, progressed chronic renal oxalosis could be confirmed.	0.797812785327834
Decompensated oxalate cardiomyopathy with disseminated myocardial oxalate crystal deposits caused acute heart failure promoted by myocardial hypertrophy in renal hypertension.	0.8097166580932255
Insulinomas are rare tumors and account for 90 % of all endocrine pancreatic tumors.	1.173003858066864
They typically present as a solitary tumor, but may occur in multiple sites (e.g.	0.9641518937227416
multiple endocrine neoplasia type I) or as a malignant disease in 10 % of cases and rarely as nesidioblastosis or islet cell adenomatosis.	1.0855132791195101
Neuroglucopenic symptoms lead to the diagnosis; inadequate high insulin and C-peptide secretion with hypoglycemia in the fasting test confirm the diagnosis.	0.933926808723933
Preoperative localization is not necessary prior to the first operation.	1.0606494542899023
The standard operation is enucleation or, depending on size and location, resection.	0.9410126599999885
The treatment of multiple tumors and islet cell hyperplasia with a high risk of recurrence is problematic.	1.1235335399323398
Subtotal resection plus enucleation seems to be better than selective tumor resection.	0.8998449581167253
In malignant insulinomas, mostly presenting with liver metastases, aggressive surgical therapy with hepatectomy and debulking, chemoembolization and systemic chemotherapy are the modalities of choice.	0.9542657888007797
MR spectroscopy is the only method for non-invasive detection of various aspects of cardiac metabolism in humans.	1.0851660176130866
While the 1H nucleus of water and fat molecules is the signal source for MR imaging, the MR spectroscopic technique allows for the study of a number of other nuclei, such as 13C, 19F, 23Na, 31P, 39K and 87Rb.	1.0023652128959057
Clinical applications presently are confined to the 31P nucleus.	0.6713802498200182
31P-MR spectroscopy allows the non-invasive study of cardiac high-energy phosphate metabolites ATP and phosphocreatine.	0.9902565336454362
The phosphocreatine/ATP ratio is considered an index of the energetic state of the heart.	0.8999378031059903
Possible clinical indications include heart failure, valve disease and coronary artery disease.	0.8065517892497981
In heart failure, the phosphocreatine/ATP ratio is reduced and correlates with clinical severity, ejection fraction and prognosis.	0.9191337922033505
In mitral and aortic valve disease, a reduced phosphocreatine/ATP ratio may indicate the optimum timing for valve replacement.	1.0247960560865799
In coronary artery disease, a regional decrease of phosphocreatine during stress ("biochemical ergometry") may indicate local ischemia.	1.2549250870310615
Furthermore, absolute quantification of high-energy phosphates may allow diagnosis of myocardial viability.	1.2240978477151194
Major technical developments, leading to improved spatial and temporal resolution will be necessary to establish MR spectroscopy as a routine clinical tool.	1.0858556639218664
A retrospective and partly prospective study was conducted to analyse both clinically and cephalometrically the craniofacial growth pattern of patients with isolated and syndrome-related premature craniosynostosis after standardized fronto-orbital and midface advancement.	0.9999592660788398
The file data of 293 children with fronto-orbital advancement were evaluated over an average period of 4.4 years.	1.0698463734958505
In addition, lateral teleradiographies of 117 patients from this group were cephalometrically analysed.	1.0973784648024436
Moreover, late results of 36 children and  8 adults with midface-advancement with an average follow-up period of 4.5 years were assessed.	1.2707096002118365
In contrast to linear craniectomy and so-called lateral canthal advancement, in only 8.2% of cases (24 out of 293 patients) were relapses requiring reoperation found in this study after fronto-orbital advancement.	1.2846823244462373
The evaluations indicate that with simple forms of craniosynostosis such as trigonocephaly and plagiocephaly predominantly very good or good growth can be observed.	0.8400467336764766
Cephalometric evaluation confirmed the limited potential of growth in the area of the anterior skull base and in the midface in the presence of syndrome-related faciocraniosynostoses.	1.1010050141439016
In such cases the cephalometrically confirmed maxillary hypoplasia, which increases in severity in the following order of syndromes `Saethre-Chotzen-Crouzon-Apert-Pfeiffer', could be influenced only to a limited degree by fronto-orbital advancement.	1.0130544248725968
For this reason midface advancement is of secondary importance in children with very severe anomalies.	1.1124559308433586
In the present evaluation, a high rate of relapse of midfacial hypoplasia was to be found in children and adolescents after this operation in accordance with other references.	1.278492458701298
Therefore, the indication for Le Fort III osteotomy in the growth period should be limited.	1.0317407583904736
The introduction of Perfluorochemicals into medicine and especially into the treatment of severe lung injury is a fascinating scientific task.	1.08581709453177
Many recall the famous experiments from Clark et al.	0.6520124215103996
in 1966 when he demonstrated "liquidventilation with perfluorocarbons" in the mammal species for the first time.	0.9682914847799731
After this hallmark, perfluorocarbons were subsequently introduced in research of acute lung injury by the techniques of Total- and Partial-Liquid-Ventilation (TLV; PLV).	0.986905726932447
Perfluorocarbons (saturated organofluorids) have unique chemical and physical properties which made them attractive substances for intraalveolar application.	0.9323961339828174
The strong C-F bindings in the perfluorocarbon molecules are responsible for their chemical stability, biochemical inertness, high capacity to dissolve respiratory gases, low surface tension and high vapor pressures.	1.0124044895292772
Furthermore, the high density of the PFC lead to radio-opacity and their distribution to dependent lung areas.	0.9477730630288819
The efficacy of PFC liquid, applied by TLV/PLV has been demonstrated in numerous animal studies using different models of acute lung injury.	0.9447208978938052
Currently, several mechanisms of action of perfluorocarbon fluids in acute lung injury are discussed: recruitment of atelectatic alveoli, prevention of endexpiratory collapse of alveoli ("liquid PEEP"), redistribution of perfusion, oxygen transport, surfactant like effects and decrease of inflammation.	1.171586420319968
Since total liquid ventilation has been used only in experimental models of lung injury, partial liquid ventilation has been introduced successfully into clinical trials (phase I-II).	1.0088902422876909
However, the results of the first randomised, controlled study of PLV in 90 adult patients suffering from severe respiratory failure (ALI/ARDS) showed no differences between PLV and conventional treatment.	1.3054025975272556
Furthermore, the instillation of relatively large amounts of liquid into the lungs poses several technical challenges and may be associated with complications such as liquithoraces, pneumothoraces and hypoxia.	0.9086942438572645
Since mammal lungs are evolutionary specialised to gas exchange using atmospheric oxygen, the application of liquids, even if they transport respiratory gases very well is not physiologic.	0.9686054451614889
To overcome these unwanted side effects, we developed a technique of perfluorocarbon vaporisation in analogy to the application of inhalation anaesthetic agents.	0.9211816152721788
After resolving some technical issues, this application technique was used successfully in an animal model of acute lung injury.	0.9700297481220734
Vaporisation of perfluorohexane in a concentration of 18 Vol.% of inspired gas improved significantly oxygenation and lung compliance.	0.9924744428132535
Though these results are promising, mechanisms of action, dose-efficacy relation, surfactant-perfluorocarbon interaction or anti-inflammatory effects of vaporised perfluorohexane are still unclear.	1.0302784187338787
These questions need to be clarified before this technique can be applied clinically.	0.9502457614848904
However, the inhalation of vapor, a technique already familiar to anaesthesiologists should avoid risks of large amounts of fluids in the bronchoalveolar space.	1.0388688209969454
Furthermore, this technique can be administered by established anaesthetic equipment with the advantage of exact dosing, continuous monitoring, and demand application in a way near to clinical routine.	1.1782634928596827
VDD pacing using a single pass lead for complete heart block is well described in adults but there are few reports of its use in children.	0.9567822317321493
We have used 6 different standard adult size single pass leads and 5 different pacemaker generators in 21 children and adolescents aged 3.7-17.2 years (mean 9.9 years) and weighing 13.5 to 76 kg (mean 34.3 kg).	1.2262982322473794
Congenital complete heart block was present in 14 patients (with associated heart disease in 2 of them), surgical complete heart block in 6 patients and 2:1 AV block of uncertain cause in 1 patient.	1.249770953191457
In 10 patients, the VDD system was their first pacing system.	1.1181634577717532
In 11 of the patients, 1-6 previous systems had been used and simultaneous extraction of ventricular leads (10) and/or atrial leads (5) was performed.	1.1714230576446811
All leads were introduced via a subclavian vein puncture (using the extraction sheath when present) and the atrial dipole was placed low in the right atrium to provide slack for further growth while maintaining atrial sensing.	1.1331206028858165
Ventricular thresholds ranged from 0.2 to 0.8 V. The minimal atrial amplitude was 0.7 to 4 mV and the maximum amplitude was 2.5 to 8 mV.	1.290449219671378
There was one early micro-displacement and the lead was repositioned.	0.8533855457326917
Over a follow-up period of 2-64 months (mean 32 months), all but 1 of the patients have maintained low ventricular pacing thresholds and adequate atrial signals for reliable pacing at rest and with exercise.	1.3227956118483886
During this time some have undergone considerable growth.	0.7745649421715908
In 1 patient, atrial sensing was lost after cardiopulmonary bypass for additional cardiac surgery at 24 months and the pacemaker was programmed into VVIR mode.	1.0412701633224468
One patient with coexisting congenital heart disease died suddenly at 3 years but the pacing system had no fault at autopsy.	0.9519266367140756
The standard adult size single pass lead provides a simple means to enable reliable atrial synchronous ventricular pacing in growing children with complete heart block.	0.858826173091217
Open reduction with internal stabilization is considered to be the standard therapy for the treatment of displaced acetabular fractures.	1.136959576693371
The internal fixation is routinely achieved by the use of plates and screws.	1.0465315301484437
The use of cerclage wires and cables as a reduction aid and definitive implant for stabilization has only occasionally been reported in the literature.	0.8697263025300785
The indication was mostly limited to use in elderly patients with insufficient bone stock.	0.9811271971205495
A newly instrument developed on the basis of a standard bone elevator is presented.	0.9413203483429923
It allows a safe, semiclosed application of a cerclage wire around the greater ischiatic notch through use of the second window of the ilioinguinal approach.	1.0097961839875174
A wide dissection at the "outside" of the pelvis is not necessary.	1.1797414148206762
A 35 year old patient developed swellings in the red colored areas of his tattoo.	0.9763563983401955
Histological examination revealed a lichenoid, pseudolymphomatous infiltrative pattern, that could be distinguished from frank lymphoma by means of electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry and molecular biology.	0.9638998502206781
The presence of dermal dendritic cells suggests a dermal-allergic pathogenesis of non-granulomatous tattoo reactions.	0.8532105571700045
Therapy of choice is an excision of the inflamed areas.	0.9935927694589384
Interventional duct occlusion is increasingly performed with detachable coils.	0.7171832694493907
In a series of 33 patients (34 procedures), we consistently used Gianturco-coils which were the initially employed coils.	1.1186364955138313
They are not securable but can be implanted in a simple manner.	1.01802359327254
The rate of embolization was high (28 %) in the first 14 procedures; however, it declined to 5 % in the last 20 patients.	1.3305282693961467
We modified the technique by partially blocking the duct, when necessary, with a catheter which was advanced from the pulmonary artery and by implanting up to three coils.	1.147015170057714
There was only one embolization and one small residual shunt in the last 20 patients.	0.9297475301583115
The mean fluoroscopy time in these patients was 11.0  +/-  5.8 minutes and decreased to 7.0  +/-  3.2 minutes in the last 10 patients with successful closure.	1.2409524662389557
Considering our experience, we continue to recommend the use of Gianturco-coils especially in the small duct which can be closed quickliy at low cost.	1.026497980893599
This review presents data supporting the involvement of the dopaminergic system in depressive illness.	0.8582402159522868
Neuroanatomical research, animal research and clinical studies have shown that a dysfunction of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system could be associated with depressive symptoms.	0.9899909572323793
Furthermore, the chronic administration of antidepressants in animals provokes a sensitisation and enhanced expression of dopaminergic receptors.	0.9792201569501312
Although the dopaminergic system has received little attention in biological research on depression in the last decades, current research on the dopaminergic system is about to change this situation.	1.017484246973974
Athletes who need high endurance capacity often use training at moderately high altitude (1500-3000 m) to improve oxygen delivery and utilization because of a hypoxia-induced increase of the red blood cell volume and adaptations at the muscular level.	1.052392358023687
As maximal heart rates decrease at high altitude and plasma lactate levels for a given workload change during prolonged exposure to high altitude, it can be difficult to control and adapt the intensity and duration of the work-outs.	1.0611803781914648
Furthermore, maximal performance capacity decreases and therefore training intensity at high altitude is usually reduced compared to training at sea level.	1.1148004720932758
To avoid these disadvantages at high altitude a concept of living at moderately high altitude and training at lower elevations, termed "live high - train low" evolved, opposing the conventional concept of "live high - train high".	0.9252907507868422
A third option using a hypobaric chamber ("live low - train low") is hardly used anymore for training athletes.	1.227885115090806
Studies on the effects of conventional high-altitude training for the improvement of athletic performance often lack a rigorous controlled design and yield controversial results.	0.8442495169568083
Regarding the new concept of "live high - train low" there is only one controlled study on college athletes and it shows a minor advantage of this new approach compared to conventional high-altitude training.	1.0608175976639567
However, training concepts are especially important for elite competitive athletes, and controlled studies with such individuals are very difficult to perform.	1.2292972708568113
Therefore, it appears that today we cannot answer the question of whether altitude-specific physiologic factors or non-altitude-related benefits of training camps account for the success of individual athletes.	1.2085565669195235
Purpose: To answer the following questions: whether reliable detection of lesions is possible in low-field-MRI-system (Magnetom Open 0.2 T) equipped with currently available hard- and software components in comparison to high field system (Magnetom Impact 1.0 T).	0.990752144724586
Furthermore, whether localization of lesions suspect in MR-mammography can be realized in MR system of low field (Magnetom Open 0.2 T).	1.1104141776136411
Patients and Methods: In 11 patients, suspect lesions were diagnosed in diagnostic MR-mammography acquired with high field system (Magnetom Impact 1.0 T) and were compared to low field MR-mammographies of 0.2 T (Magnetom Open 0.2 T).	1.003885065430268
In six of the 11 patients a suspect lesion was localized using wire marking.	0.9618381166906429
Results: All lesions considered suspect in diagnostic MR-mammography (Magnetom Impact 1.0 T) were also clearly identified in the 0.2 T system (Magnetom Open).	1.0401681961756712
In six cases wire marking was performed without any complications and with an accuracy of K 0.5 cm distance to the lesion.	1.1724063984397588
Conclusion: Although studies in the 0.2 T system clearly showed inferior SNR (34.6 vs. 83.1) and CNR (14.6 vs. 43.5) compared to studies with the high field system, all lesions considered suspect in diagnostic MR-mammography were reliably identified also in 0.2 T studies.	1.1443877300394811
Due to its open construction permitting permanent access to the breast and due to sufficient image quality, the Magnetom Open is suitable for interventions on the breast.	0.9067314905639408
Children with limb deficiencies or amputations of the lower extremities should be enabled to stand or to walk according to their state of development, because just standing and walking are among the most important preconditions for the best possible integration.	1.1021646686221682
Supply them with a prosthesis, orthesis and orthoprosthesis is therefore indispensable for rehabilitation.	0.8723318644325762
While a prosthesis replaces parts of the extremities, orthesis stabilizes the existing extremity.	0.8561886184968479
Orthoprostheses compensate longitudinal malformations, have a supporting effect, allow growth to be controlled and compensate for shortening.	1.0168920797333365
Just as important as the remedy is early medical treatment.	0.7069072697863679
The sooner the treatment starts, the better the results.	0.9414426228335141
As a result of the present experiences with the inhalative application of nitric oxide (NO) in term babies now the first promising reports about NO application in preterm babies have been published.	1.063575393440444
HIV remains infectious at room temperature for about six to twelve hours under sterile conditions, the time is shorter in the presence of bacteria and when clotting occurs.	1.0149360185929932
HIV infectivity is easily destroyed by disinfectants.	0.5965524682377202
The human infectious dose of HIV is around 100 to 1000 particles, dependent on the virus and the site of entry into the host.	0.9136972397167168
After inoculation new HIV is produced after 24 hours, and HIV has spread over the whole organism by the end of one or two weeks.	1.12745434761004
HIV infection may be detected after four to twelve weeks by antibody assays, and after eleven days by nucleic acid based assays.	1.0495618085869158
Anti-HIV production might be slowed down under initial therapy.	0.6431601588398342
In addition to psychiatric outpatient treatment, the detoxification of alcoholics in psychiatric hospitals is an important link between medical detoxification and psychosocial inpatient treatment aiming at abstinence.	1.0330493813612123
Integrated models of inpatient detoxification and motivation therapy focus on improvement of the motivation of patients towards further treatment of their alcoholism and towards abstinence.	0.937849545405358
In our study 529 alcoholics underwent such treatment lasting between 2 to 3 weeks.	0.9811267741321053
A total of 469 patients (89%) were followed up after 8  months; 242 alcoholics (52% of the follow-up sample; 46% of the whole sample) achieved the treatment goal and started further treatment, mainly as inpatients.	1.280471226689073
Fifty-four of these patients relapsed before they started further alcoholism treatment, but achieved abstinence afterwards; 60 (25%) of these 242 patients relapsed after the specific alcoholism therapy; 227 alcoholics did not start further treatment after the initial detoxification and motivation therapy.	1.1275974965901268
In this subpopulation, 113 (50%) relapsed during the follow-up period.	0.9866271525472605
Although this is not a controlled study, it can be concluded that integrated inpatient detoxification and motivation therapy has positive effects on the treatment behavior of alcoholic patients and enhances the probability of further abstinence.	1.1261354376444281
In this article we report a very rare case of simultaneous and bilateral rupture of the quadriceps tendon in a 38-year-old patient.	1.0824995705564666
The initial diagnosis was "herniated vertebral disk".	0.8194837425637748
Although there was an extensive neurological and psychiatric examination in combination with several operations, it took almost 3 months until the real reason was found.	1.1357278081820836
In this case report we describe our postoperative treatment of early mobilization and compare it with other therapies.	1.0900942081368736
Neuroendocrine tumors of the thymus, also known as thymic carcinoids, are rare tumors of the anterior mediastinum.	1.2120528078045614
They occur sporadically or in association with the MEN I syndrome.	0.649691945781184
We present five patients (four male, one female; age of first manifestation 19-53 years) who were operated on at our hospital between 1984 and 1995 for neuroendocrine thymic tumors.	1.1456221228476267
A hormone-producing tumor presented with Cushing's syndrome in two patients.	0.8636557830957444
Two patients had MEN I syndrome.	0.6744708584638299
Only in the female patient the primary tumor was confined to the thymus.	1.1294389043824764
We found lymph node metastases in three patients and a distant metastasis in one.	1.0993670609754638
The neuroendocrine tumors have a high rate of local recurrences and thus we performed 11 operations using a transthoracic or transsternal approach.	0.9277021033054317
Since there was no operative mortality and adjuvant therapies are of limited value, we recommend surgery even in case of recurrence.	1.134916953801609
Korsakoff's psychosis (Wernicke-Korsakoff-Syndrome) following severe, long-term  alcoholism is considered to be widely resistent to treatment.	0.9269333021300799
We report two cases with beneficial effects of treatment by a combination of clonidine and fluvoxamine.	0.8895085797443256
The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia was based on the neuroleptical blockade of central dopamine D2 receptors.	0.8322232964902847
Brain imaging studies, however, generally failed to demonstrate a significant increase in central D2 receptors among schizophrenic patients.	1.0210292273515973
Using a novel approach, the group of Laruelle and Abi-Dargham was now able to demonstrate that schizophrenic patients have increased synaptic dopamine concentrations in the striatum.	0.9845902864343355
Endogenous dopamine competes with a radioligand for binding at dopamine D2 receptors; compared to healthy control subjects, blockade of dopamine production in neuroleptic-naive schizophrenic patients induced a significantly higher increase in D2 binding of the infused radioligand, indicating higher endogenous synaptic dopamine.	0.9208331237984768
A similar increase in D2 binding was also observed in drug-free schizophrenics who had previously been treated with neuroleptics; these patients also showed an increased density of striatal D2 receptors, most likely due to counteradaptive upregulation of D2 receptors during neuroleptic medication.	1.0109974396515373
The Columbia study provides an important indication of hyperdopaminergic function in schizophrenia.	0.8553056701537607
Multiple and bilateral oncocytomas are rare.	0.5759188004181919
There are only ten cases that have been previously described.	0.8910298834103575
Three of these displayed multiple and bilateral oncocytomas and microoncocytomas, a so-called oncocytomatosis.	0.9875552423546746
This report describes a case of renal oncocytomatosis found at autopsy.	0.979785513821322
In addition, we found an adrenal adenoma, a pheochromocytoma and thoracic cicatrices 4 years after curatively resected large cell carcinoma of the lung.	1.285794813989215
In the distal renal tubules we found oncocytic epithelial cells, with partial transition into microoncocytomas.	0.9861890213665289
Immunhistochemically, these and the main oncocytomas were CD 10 negative.	1.0313276821140005
These findings support the origin of oncocytoma from oncocytically transformed distal tubular epithelium.	0.7362366924096946
CGH analysis of the different tumors revealed no common cytogenetic changes.	1.048427853010301
Coexistence of renal oncocytoma with other tumors is rare.	0.6844134495677417
Hitherto, coexistence of a renal oncocytomatosis with multiple tumors has not been described.	0.91162651143287
Thyroid disorders in childhood needing surgery are rare.	0.7706324693117251
Therapeutical procedures therefore are derived from adult surgery with modifications to meet the specific need of the pediatric patient.	0.8279545427244603
The indications for operation are presented with regard to incidence and type of the defect, and the surgical procedures with regard to the extent of the lesion results.	1.4688279266928697
Malignant bone tumors require the same careful staging as, for example, lung cancer.	0.9829966451070717
However, well-established staging systems for non-osseous tumors are not suitable for bone tumors.	1.2852195174512693
Therefore we present Enneking's staging system for malign bone tumors here, which is better adapted to the special problems of these entities because it integrates clinical, radiological and histological findings.	1.0664657858126685
The weak points of Enneking's staging system (e.g.	0.5125676651012102
inflexibility, changes in radiological modalities in the past 20 years) are discussed.	1.1347830598867479
Efficient analgesia may be the major objective in the cardiovascular risk patient following myocardial infarction, acute occlusion of peripheral vessels, or dissection/perforation of major abdominal vessels.	1.1264082877688382
It was the purpose of the study to investigate the haemodynamic and respiratory side effects of eight different opioids in 57 circulatory risk patients prior to major vascular surgery.	1.2119244603550923
Patients were randomly allocated to eight groups, each receiving a different opioid within a clinical, equipotent dose range (buprenorphine, fentanyl, morphine, nalbuphine, pentazocine, pethidine, tramadol, alfentanil).	0.9358067891098244
A complete haemodynamic and blood gas status was obtained prior to as well as 5, 10, 15, and 20 min following opioid administration.	1.0407853544548031
Monitoring included a complete invasive haemodynamic and blood gas status.	0.7411640652219603
Statistical evaluation was performed by 1- and 2-factorial ANOVA (P<0.05).	0.9951001839699367
Significant time effects (changes from baseline at the time of measurement) were observed for heart rate and total peripheral resistance, while significant group (group-specific differences in the course of values at the different times of measurements) and time effects were noted for mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, stroke volume index, and PaO2.	1.2909053556764811
No major effects were observed following morphine, fentanyl, alfentanil, tramadol, and nalbuphine.	0.8649212899627505
Buprenorphine caused distinct respiratory depression accompanied by an increase in pulmonary vascular tone.	0.8608561083065952
Pentazocine and pethidine caused a significant increase in MPAP and peripheral vascular resistance while pethidine also produced marked respiratory depression.	0.849301625001173
For interpretation of the results, factors such as respiratory depression, histamine release, secretion of endogenous catecholamines, and hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction have to be discussed.	0.940048363189995
Tramadol, an opioid with moderate potency, seems to offer some advantages due to its minor cardiovascular and respiratory side effects.	1.0392208376883398
In this article we report a case of an early postoperative compartment syndrome of the anterior tibial compartment with complete sensomotoric palsy of the peroneal nerve after arthroscopic-assisted replacement of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) of the knee.	1.1389300684415042
The tourniquet pressure was 360 mm Hg and operation time was 1.75 h. After the operation the leg was bandaged to avoid swelling of the leg and as antithrombotic prophylaxis.	1.128889717619815
Analgesic therapy was by continuous epidural bupivacaine infusion.	0.801935706670592
Increasing pain of the lower leg was suppressed by additional analgesia.	1.1365413323393583
Due to persistent pain despite regular analgesia, the patient was sent to a main hospital on the 3rd postoperative day, where an extremely painful and swollen anterior tibial compartment with intracompartimental pressure of over 100 mm Hg was found.	1.0914649440670328
The compartment was released immediately.	0.5774224672435881
Despite the appearance of severe muscle damage, no extensive débridement was done.	0.9842052086493069
At the second examination, at 48 h, there was minimal perfusion of the muscles without contraction and islands of ischemic necrosis.	1.1469292559503705
Clinically, there was complete palsy of the dorsiflexors of the foot.	1.0787757831177174
The case shows the danger of a compartment syndrome when tourniquet of the limb, arthroscopy and a firm bandage are combined.	0.8846077274421574
Continuous epidural analgesia masks the classic symptoms of compartment syndrome.	0.7543928861641409
The influence of biomechanics in surgery of the locomotor apparatus has been constantly increasing over the last few decades.	0.8879666212246177
The purpose of this study was to determine wether biomechanical studies can significantly influence therapy and treatment of shoulder injuries, especially shoulder instability.	1.1454122358606218
The investigation was performed on 23 fresh human specimens with intact capsular ligaments of the glenohumeral joint.	0.8026337186217132
A Bankart lesion from 3 o'clock to 6 o'clock was repaired, and a Bankart repair and anterior inferior capsular shift, as described by Neer, were performed.	1.2223252775351428
The measurement was done on six clinically relevant positions of instability: superior, anterior, anterior-inferior, inferior, posterior-inferior, posterior.	1.0264128608537681
Measurement was done using a specially developed strain-gauge system.	0.824658150843229
It was demonstrated that both instability and too much stability of the shoulder joint lead to a significant change in shoulder biomechanics.	1.0669844089430414
The anatomical 0-position of the glenohumeral joint in 110  ° of abduction is a position of about 60  ° of external rotation compared to the 0-position for clinical measurement.	1.1651614198652798
From the therapy point of view, one has to ask for anatomical reconstruction instead of tight repair in soft-tissue repair in the glenohumeral joint.	0.9179113544669364
Immediate post-operative rehabilitation in a 60  ° range of motion is possible.	1.0334280925204005
A total of 61 patients suffering from weight loss and epigastric pain were screened by color flow Duplex imaging (CFDJ) of the abdominal vessels.	1.18904588875079
Criteria for diagnosis were (1) peak flow in the celiac axis (CA) of more than 200 cm/s; (2) fixing of the CA stenosis during expiration and inspiration, and (3) steal phenomenon and reversal of flow in the superior mesenteric artery (SMA).	1.118471357083861
Results: Of 61 patients 21 (34.4%) fulfilled the criteria; 38 (62.3%) were excluded, and 2 patients could not be evaluated.	1.3590424689232756
Of 21 patients 10 were operated on after confirming diagnosis by angiography of CA and SMA.	0.8632259224448328
After a follow-up of 28 months 80% of the operated patients were free of symptoms, 10% improved, and 10% showed no change.	1.2987467977370963
Conclusion: Successful operative treatment of CA compression includes (1) CFDJ of CA and SMA proving stenosis persisting in inspirational position of the diaphragm; (2) angiography of CA and SMA showing a steal phenomenon including blood flow reversal in SMA; (3) triad of symptoms: epigastric pain, postprandial pain and weight loss; and (4) exclusion of other causes, i.e.	1.0157754443866975

Patients with rheumatic diseases are commonly treated as an outpatient in their local environment or are referred to specialized centers.	0.9627378484534116
Two recently founded daypatient clinics in Berlin and Frankfurt/Rhein-Main (Germany) for patients suffering from rheumatic diseases will be evaluated for their medical outcome and cost-effectivness of comprehensive treatment of RA patients in stages of high inflammatory activity and progressive disability.	1.080524891911609
The study design will be prospective, controlled, and randomized to compare outpatient and daypatient treatment.	1.0802783743985434
The case-control study design with matched pairs within the network of collaborative arthritis centers will be used to compare daypatient and inpatient treatment.	0.9166205472586155
The paper contains a review of studies published in English or German language dealing with daypatient treatment of RA patients.	0.8782786870188517
A case of atrial ectopic tachycardia in an infant probably caused by a small tumor in the interatrial septum is presented.	0.989189193529019
The arrhythmia was successfully treated with amiodarone.	0.6911182249992351
Several histologic abnormalities are known to cause AET, but an intracardiac tumor detectable by two-dimensional echocardiography is extremely rare.	1.0622324336659927
AET - especially in childhood - as well as cardiac tumors show a tendency to regression, so that even in this case medical treatment should be the first therapeutic choice.	1.3919894802981103
Interventional or surgical treatment is required just for those patients with AET that is resistant to medical treatment or reoccurs after finishing the medical treatment.	1.0753182503459338
Tonsure trichotillomania is a subtype of trichotillomania in which the scalp exhibits a tonsural pattern of alopecia over the crown, extending to the frontal margin and sparing the lateral margins and the nape of the neck.	0.9665674589634193
It differs from to the more common form of childhood trichotillomania in that predominantly female adolescents are affected and its incidence is related to quite severely pathologic psychodynamics, often with a disturbed relationship to female sexuality.	0.9567180600839524
The treating physician should be more guarded in assessing the prognosis; hair plucking often continues for years.	0.8146507560365206
Two patients with tonsure alopecia, associated in one case with trichotillomania of the pubic hair and in the other with enuresis, are presented.	1.2601413055172956
The aim of the following study was to develop an osteoporotic model by means of ovariectomy.	1.470193055617047
Bone mineral density of the upper and lower jaw was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DPX) before and after ovariectomy.	0.8846239719980281
Histomorphometric measurements were done by a microtomography system.	0.8109314073945204
Bone mineral density decreased significantly after ovariectomy in the upper and lower jaw.	0.9348581346002879
There is evidence for the community effectiveness of preventive geriatric intervention programs prior to the need for help or long-term care from a couple of prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs).	1.0623758199322448
For geriatric rehabilitation programs tailored to older people with imminent or manifest need for long-term care analogous - evidence is still lacking.	1.0673666504060284
The nation-wide leading boards of the FRG's Sickness Insurance Administration in conjunction with its Central Medical Service have formulated guidelines for the formation of a nation-wide ambulatory geriatric rehabilitation service to realize the postulate of the long-term care insurance legislation "rehabilitation prior to long-term care".	1.0028210209606434
These guidelines must be proven empirically.	0.6072861736926806
To prove the effectiveness and efficiency of the foreseen ambulatory geriatric rehabilitation service, the RCT design would be highly desirable.	0.9996820246911606
Unfortunately, the prerequisites in the field of methodology are poor since valid, reproducible and feasible criteria for the selection of suitable patients and measurement criteria which meet the requirement of proven medium-term sensitivity to change do not yet exist.	1.06499418705544
Nevertheless, there is a great and urgent need, for the first time, to investigate the cost-effectiveness ratio for this ambulatory geriatric rehabilitation service to be established in the FRG, leaving aside the methodologic desiderata of randomized control-groups.	1.2160641379748294
"Idiopathic" ventricular tachycardia is an exclusion diagnosis.	0.6263508472867213
The underlying reasons and mechanisms of "idiopathic" ventricular tachycardias are still not completely understood.	0.8552590072009993
Recent investigations showed a high prevalence of morphological abnormalities in the right ventricle of patients with "idiopathic" ventricular tachycardia out of the right ventricular outflow tract, which could often be correlated with the origin of the ventricular tachycardia.	1.2107555079580041
These described abnormalities were not uniform.	0.6696450489810745
Here we report about a patient suffering from drug-refractory "idiopathic" ventricular tachycardia for 10 years.	0.7896576091164547
This is the first report in which the origin of an "idiopathic" ventricular tachycardia could be localized by right-ventricular angiography, magnetic resonance tomography and electrophysiological study in the area of an interventricular septal thickening of the right ventricular outflow tract and cured by radiofrequency catheter ablation.	1.047426147930132
Fetal teratomas are extra- or intracorporal congenital malformations with different localization.	0.9470931279371416
Although they are rare, they may provoke severe obstetrical complications if they are not prenatally diagnosed.	1.109903041468103
If sonographic examination of fetal teratomas is performed, it is necessary to evaluate the further development of pregnancy for fetal outcome and pregnancy aspects in relationship to the localization, size and ultrasound criteria of the tumor.	1.0400438107095002
Sonographic findings reveal the criteria and conditions for conservative or invasive management or reasons for continuing or terminating the pregnancy.	0.873889191556564
Prenatal ultrasound examination is the only possibility to reduce perinatal morbidity and mortality, as exemplified by 8 prenatally examined fetal teratomas.	1.0742254955458213
We report on a 62-year-old female patient with melena in which polypoid lesions of the cecum were discovered endoscopically.	1.0338036887585302
Histological examination of mucosal biopsies revealed an inflammatory process with lots of histiocytes and so-called Michaelis-Gutmann bodies, leading to the diagnosis of a malakoplakia of the colon.	0.9809441623093997
No other organs were found affected.	0.7084212676178906
In the course of an antibiotic therapy, there was no melena detectable over a period of six months.	1.050046831444133
Malakoplakia, an inflammation usually affecting the urogenital tract, is rarely found in the colon, with only 35 cases published until now.	1.2560375479130637
It is frequently associated with other diseases like neoplastic or inflammatory disorders, immune defect syndromes or heroin abuse.	0.8923717936472545
This spectrum is expanded by our report in which a long-standing alcohol abuse was found as an attendant disease.	1.1000260046936154
Unilateral laterothoracic exanthem a (ULE) is a self-limited, probably infectious-allergic skin disease predominately affecting small children.	1.0499700386221014
We describe five such cases.	0.5044196919662797
The typical unilaterally located or at least unilaterally dominant exanthem usually starts in the axillary region and is characterized by red, partly confluent papules and fine scales.	0.9062275375116632
Two of the children presented with atypical manifestations of ULE.	1.000227789001189
Due to its asymptomatic course, therapy is not necessary in the majority of cases.	1.3811823626378417
Minimally invasive adrenalectomy is now an accepted alternative to conventional adrenalectomy.	0.8579417571643867
As in open surgery, several different endoscopic approaches to the adrenal glands have been described.	0.9396236805797051
In principle, one must distinguish between the laparoscopic and the retroperitoneoscopic access.	0.9711261369274606
All adrenal tumors - pheochromocytomas included - except adrenal carcinomas can be removed endoscopically.	1.0637804589577462
However, the use of these techniques is limited in patients with particularly large tumors.	1.2062545201133645
The results reported to date are convincing.	0.7457482589870398
Only limited data are available as yet to compare conventional and endoscopic adrenalectomy.	0.9512971076341478
Because adrenal diseases requiring surgery are rare, endoscopic adrenalectomy is an operation that, for the present, will be limited to centers with a particular interest in laparoscopic and endocrine surgery.	1.1241250045776103
Economic evaluations have become more and more important in the somatotherapeutic field.	0.8533481226563276
This survey's objective was to examine if the current economic evaluation techniques can be applied to psychotherapy.	0.9982073442157842
8 data banks, 17 key words from the psychotherapeutic field and 14 economic key words were used, the identified original studies were classified in accordance with Drummond, the methodical quality of each study was assessed at a score between 0 and 10 points.	1.0882000037400723
21 studies were found: 16 cost- benefit analyses, 4 cost-effectiveness analyses and one cost-utility analysis.	1.0986656979303178
The quality of the representation of the clinical results (mean value 8.6) was better than that of the economic results (mean value 6.1).	1.4185206205677394
It was perfectly possible to evaluate psychotherapeutic interventions with regard to economic aspects by means of the current techniques but in most cases there was a considerable lack of quality in both representation and calculation.	1.1557505296527608
Furthermore the evaluation type of cost-utility analysis, which is the only one that takes quality of life aspects into consideration and therewith seems to be the most appropriate approach regarding the psychotherapeutic field, has been greatly ignored.	1.241984033652053
As a net effect of ACE-inhibitors and AT1-receptor antagonists on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) cardioprotection due to vasodilative (reduction of blood pressure, afterload reduction), antiproliferative (reduced cell growth, reduction of "vascular" andor "ventricular remodeling", reduced formation of extracellular matrix), as well as antiadrenergic actions and due to the stimulating effect on natriuresis, reduction of blood pressure, preload reduction can be expected.	1.0168118121636824
These aims of therapy have mostly been confirmed for the action of ACE-inhibitors by experimental and clinical studies but except for the treatment of arterial hypertension and few preliminary reports concerning the treatment of cardiac dysfunction, no comparable data are available for AT1-receptor antagonists.	1.0962378667900958
To date, an antithrombotic and profibrinolytic action could only be demonstrated for ACE-inhibitors.	1.0239400817782738
This effect has been discussed to be responsible for the improvement of long-term prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease.	0.938076904762264
Despite the similar spectrum of action there exist important differences between ACE-inhibitors and AT1-receptor antagonists that might underline the need of an individual use of these drugs: the dual action of ACE-inhibitors on the RAS and the kinin system bears many benefits but has been also shown to be accompanied by side-effects, mainly chronic dry cough, in a relatively high percentage of patients thus leading to discontinuation of therapy in 8-14%.	1.11613365415505
This respective side-effect can be prevented by the use of AT1-receptor antagonists.	0.8266391779176755
It has been discussed whether the incomplete action of ACE-inhibitors on AT1-receptor-mediated effects is at least in part responsible for the efficacy of this drug which is relatively high (75-80%) as compared to other substances.	1.2433220295037477
Due to their direct action, AT1-receptor-blockers might also be of high effectiveness for the treatment of severe heart failure.	1.1001875465780047
A combination of the ACE-inhibitor-mediated activation of the kinin-system with the more specific blockade of AT1-receptors by AT1-receptor antagonists might be of benefit and is currently under investigation.	1.037935353863205
Finally, it has been discussed that the incresed AT II concentration in case of AT1-receptor-blockade activates AT2-receptor-mediated mechanisms thus leading to an additive vasoprotective effect.	1.090109779742369
An isomorphic response is defined as a nonspecific skin stimulus eliciting a disease-specific skin reaction.	0.8558051606854494
We report on the development of the Koebner phenomenon in a 32 year old patient with psoriasis after skin testing with UVB at a dose above 0,055 J/cm2.	1.1652761187651166
In addition we describe a 28 years old patient who developed new psoriatic plaques in the areas affected by the virus after a varicella infection.	1.1162403587201373
The presence of nicotine in sweat obtained from smokers and one non-smoker exposed to tobacco smoke after 4 h to 8 days of nicotine-free time was investigated.	0.9232357310598225
Following stimulation of the eccrine glands, sweat samples were taken every hour for 6 h.The total nicotine concentrations, i.e.	0.8611333643577791
the sum of nicotine and its metabolites, were determined by radioimmunoassay.	1.1667374369822294
The presence of unchanged nicotine was revealed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.	0.8170268853205859
Up to now there is no specific treatment targeting the ultimate cause of interstitial cystitis (IC), since its pathogenesis and etiology are still unknown.	1.1779166188724517
Most studies focussing on oral medication have not been randomized, double-blinded or placebo-controlled.	0.9665043607244271
Numerous case reports and intent-to-treat trials are lacking a systematic approach and do not meet evidence-based medicine criteria.	0.9769355397679067
Consequently there is as yet no standard oral therapy available for the treatment of IC.	0.9505146008333928
Differential radiomodification induced by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) is proving to be a feasible modality for optimizing tumor radiotherapy.	1.31395103041732
Our earlier work on Ehrlich ascites tumor cells has shown that pretreatment with hematoporphyrin derivatives increases the uptake and phosphorylation of 2-DG.	0.8210669408866224
Moreover, the alteration induced in bioenergetic profile was more drastic and less reversible.	0.9608900348609242
The promising combination of hematoporphyrin derivatives and 2-DG has been further evaluated in the Ehrlich ascites tumor bearing mice for determining the effects on radiotherapeutic response.	1.005322489625123
Solid tumors (average volume = 0.9 +/- 0.1 cm3) implanted in Swiss-albino strain "A" mice were focally irradiated (10 Gy) using 60Co teletherapy.	1.1985369755684494
Tumor bioenergetics was assessed by 31P MR spectroscopy.	0.6758711506333093
The uptake and phosphorylation of 2-DG was observed to be increased following pretreatment with hematoporphyrin derivatives.	0.9085028758003377
Upon hematoporphyrin derivatives + 2-DG treatment followed by irridiation, the intracellular pH reduced and a remarkable increase in glycerophosphorylcholine and inorganic phosphate levels was observed.	0.9838597675230084
The present study demonstrates the potential of hematoporphyrin derivative pretreatment in increasing the bioavailability of 2-DG in a mice Ehrlich ascites tumor model.	1.0649745175966938
The finding may have interesting clinical implications in the form of increased manifestation of the radiation-induced damage in the case of use of these drugs as a potential adjuvant in radiotherapy of tumors.	1.1349308394019662
The novel Lenz (1835) by the German author, social revolutionist and physician Georg Büchner (1813-1837) can be regarded as a prominent document in the history of medicine.	1.0086831448433702
On the one hand, Büchner's description of a schizophrenic disorder meets recent criteria; on the other, he hints at the physician's modern general attitude toward the patient.	1.0194829163614687
The latter is derived from his philosophy of art and political motives.	0.8148469779215735
The hypothesis is discussed that a dysfunction of the descending antinociceptive system may underly the pain of fibromyalgia.	0.857357344552466
Data from animal experimentation show that an interruption of the system by spinal cord cooling leads to (1) increase in ongoing activity,  (2) lowering in stimulation threshold, and (3) increase in response magnitude in nociceptive dorsal horn neurons.	1.1217452038198161
The influence of the descending system was stronger on the responses to input from deep nociceptors than to input from cutaneous nociceptors.	0.9241247162122271
If similar changes occur also in patients, an impairment of the tonicly active descending system should be followed by (1) spontaneous pain (ongoing activity), (2) tenderness (lowering in mechanical threshold), and (3) hyperalgesia (increased responses to noxious stimuli).	1.0449946056547894
These changes should affect mainly deep pain, because the antinociceptive system influences predominantly input from deep nociceptors.	0.9207589644665015
Animal experiments with microbiologic examinations and studies in cell cultures have shown that ionomer cement is a biocompatible and biostable bone replacement material in the head and neck region.	0.8554932682299747
Clinical and functional results of its use in the human middle ear have proven to be satisfactory during a maximal period of 2.5 years observation.	1.1711491197675419
The present trial was continued in order to determine the long-term behavior of ionomer cement (Ionos partial and total ossicles) after reconstruction of the ossicular chain.	1.0469423981846526
The ossicular chain was reconstructed in 343 cases and included various losses of one or more of the ossicles (i.e., incus, incus and malleus, incus and stapes superstructure, and malleus, incus and stapes superstructure).	1.0163545552510391
Follow-up extended over a maximum period of 5.5 years.	1.170929524649503
Patients were examined under a surgical microscope and a pure-tone audiogram was performed at regular intervals.	1.056914396779886
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is not presently performed in Germany.	0.916921148365748
According to PGD's opponents there, existing laws for the protection of embryos forbid this type of diagnostics.	0.8084033492512788
Proponents feel that these laws do not stand in the way of PGD, depending on legal viewpoint.	0.8969951138382065
This controversy has hindered PGD's application in Germany.	0.672518882310811
The nature of this longstanding, emotional discussion is not easy to describe to scientists abroad.	0.9219790668813928
This retrospective study investigated the stability of the small AO external fixator in a radioradial configuration used in the treatment of 42 mostly unstable distal radius fractures (types A-3.2, C-1.2 and C-2.1 according to the AO classification).	1.1682981427902595
No bone grafting was performed.	0.7304912295349584
All cases were documented with antero-posterior and lateral X-rays preoperatively, 0, 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively and after consolidation.	1.357050019979148
Early functional aftertreatment was started one week after surgery.	0.8643406521522266
Thirty-six fractures showed a dorsal comminution, combined with osteopenia in 18 cases.	1.041669643915949
The mean preoperative radial angle of 17 ° was normalized to 25 ° postoperatively.	0.8591163163051835
The mean preoperative volar angle of minus 30 ° was reduced to 12 ° postoperatively.	0.9133964518619339
None of these mean angles changed until consolidation.	0.7403067731755665
The external fixator was removed on average after 7 weeks (range 6-10 weeks) depending on the radiological fracture healing.	1.0318987383532134
The small AO external fixator in a radioradial configuration proved to be stable enough for early functional aftertreatment of the wrist.	0.7285273539782352
Its stability is related to a proper operative technique and correct indication (unstable Colles type with one or two distal fragments).	0.9926398558440124
Bone grafting is unnecessary if the external fixator is left in situ until bony consolidation.	0.890585564209899
Purpose: To develop and implement a method to obtain digital subtraction (DS) spiral computed tomography angiograms (SCTA) in order to avoid superimposition of bony structures and vascular calcifications on SCTA maximum intensity projections (MIPs) and shaded surface display (SSD).	1.0242732098626914
The concept of small-volume resuscitation, the rapid infusion of a small volume (4 ml/kg BW) of hyperosmolar 7.2-7.5% saline solution for the initial therapy of severe hypovolemia and shock was advocated more than a decade ago.	1.3687685647492067
Numerous publications have established that hyperosmolar saline solution can restore arterial blood pressure, cardiac index and oxygen delivery as well as organ perfusion to pre-shock values.	0.9557674899257307
Most prehospital studies failed to yield conclusive results with respect to a reduction in overall mortality.	0.8474207960177753
A meta-analysis of preclinical studies from North and South America, however, has indicated an increase in survival rate by 5.1% following small-volume resuscitation when compared to standard of care.	1.1243643249314523
Moreover, small-volume resuscitation appears to be of specific impact in patients suffering from head injuries with increased ICP and in severest trauma requiring immediate surgical intervention.	1.133653332403703
The utility of electron beam computed tomography (EBT) to estimate cerebral blood volume (CBV) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) was evaluated.	1.0372339778944837
Eleven patients with suspected acute cerebral ischemia were investigated.	0.9505714713801761
The EBT was performed with an acquisition time of 50 ms per slice at eight parallel levels.	0.9669212549029802
To compare signal/noise and contrast/ noise ratios the data from the EBT investigation were compared to a similar examination on a spiral CT.	0.9985076537088414
The signal/noise ratio with EBT was about 30%, the contrast/noise ratio 25% of that with spiral CT.	1.2048746441042653
The absolute values of CBV were 4.9 +/- 1.2 ml/100 g (EBT); CBF was 50.5 +/- 7.0 ml/100 g/min in normal contralateral brain tissue.	1.0307130985391075
In four patients with proven infarcts on follow-up, the ischemic areas had a CBV ranging from 1.7 to 3.8 ml/100 g, while CBF ranged from 9.4 to 24.5 ml/100 g/min.	1.2783600302569211
Using a bolus injection of contrast material, calculation of absolute CBV and CBF is feasible using EBT.	0.765238052472046
Advantages of EBT are the absolute measurements possible and it's multislice capability.	0.8744034606227086
Disadvantages, however, are caused by the high image noise, limiting the demarcation of ischemic tissue.	1.0142913891566578
The report, in two parts, sums up the findings of a survey covering 52 cities in Central Europe.	1.1605654134161207
Most administrations have imposed a ban on feeding street pigeons, but this has been more or less unsuccessful.	1.0307934336689857
Information campaigns were used on a large scale, along with more controversial methods such as catching the birds or shooting them down, providing pigeon houses, administering hormone preparations, chemosterilization, and exclusion from buildings.	0.9084973030833297
Few attempts were made to reduce the number of breeding places.	0.7781814486766704
Population reduction by poisons or natural enemies seems to be negligible.	0.705995093607354
We report a rare case of an accident during which a pedestrian was hit by a car and was thrown through the windscreen into the front seat.	0.9821135987154015
Apart from the high speed (100 km/h or more) the traumatic amputation of both lower legs and the resulting reduced angular momentum mainly contributed to the final position of the pedestrian in the vehicle.	1.152788287744652
In addition, the low height of the person standing in front of the vehicle is deemed to have been a supporting factor for the course of the accident.	1.0889519095312248
A 41-year-old woman with severe juvenile diabetes mellitus suffered from profund hypothermia after loss of thermoregulation in diabetic ketoacidosis.	0.8775282144226151
She was found unconscious, without measurable blood pressure; the electrocardiogram (ECG) showed bradycardia of 30/min and the rectal temperature was 23.7  °C.	1.1927714870405302
The patient received mechanical ventilation, fluid therapy, warmed gastric lavage, and, unfortunately, inotropic medication.	1.0946609814114638
She was transferred to a department of cardiac surgery in order to continue the therapy with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).	0.8588962971439295
On arrival, the patient had a rectal temperature of 27.3  °C, the ECG showed an absolute arrhythmia with a frequency of 70/min, and the blood pressure was 63/43 mm Hg.	1.4097148606217798
We decided to use a rapidly available but not highly invasive venovenous hemofiltration technique for slowly rewarming the patient.	0.8531438698639155
Vascular access was achieved by percutaneous femoral vein cannulation with a Shaldon catheter.	0.8573809312095594
The hemofiltration system (Gambro AK-10, Gambro AB, Sweden) was instituted with a blood flow rate of 200 ml/min.	0.99416025448365
The hemofiltration monitor controls the pumps for filtering and substituting fluid volumes and allows the infusion solutions to be heated up to 40  °C.	0.8454784532530826
Sinus rhythm resumed without antiarrhythmic medications at a temperature of 29.5  °C, and within 8 h the patient was rewarmed to 35.5  °C.	1.23167740519864
After treatment of the adult respiratory distress syndrome caused by pneumonia, she was discharged from the intensive care unit to complete treatment with no evidence of any permanent organ damage.	1.1153634373107113
We conclude that hemofiltration may be the method of choice for rewarming deeply hypothermic patients when their circulation is preserved.	1.046182373049967
Under these circumstances, it is preferable to external rewarming techniques, as it avoids the disadvantages of temperature afterdrop and rewarming shock.	1.1093753334399628
Rewarming rates of 1.5  °C/h seem to be adequate.	1.2115871334892616
Hemofiltration systems are more widespread, less invasive, and easier to handle compared to CPB techniques, which should be preferred in situations of prolonged unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation with cardiac arrest and deep core temperatures.	1.1318668697022702
We report an unusual injury of the face caused by the spoke of an automatic telescoping umbrella that come loose when the umbrella was opened.	0.9827200292286189
Due to the shot-like force of the spoke, the left nostril, septum and right wall of the nasal cavity were pierced.	1.077745332553919
The part with the joint penetrated into the maxillary antrum.	0.7879985498158526
In order to remove the spoke, wire scissors had to be used to cuff off the spoke's joint inside the surgically opened maxillary sinus.	1.000438009646244
Seven patients with pulmonary metastases of malignant melanoma were treated with inhalation therapy with 36 million IU interleukin-2 for six months.	1.0974337411488755
Inhalation therapy was combined with four bolus infusions of DTIC at a dose of 850 mg/m2 once every four weeks.	0.9292083923455354
Response rates were 71,4% with 2 patients achieving a complete remission (CR), 2 partial remissions (PR), 1 stable disease (SD), and 2 progressing disease (PD).	1.354353784138495
Therapy was well tolerated with low toxicity.	0.7842397482955368
Six of the patients developed cough; one patient was slightly feverish.	1.458371315394081
We conclude that inhalation therapy of lung metastases is a promising addition to the therapeutic arsenal against malignant melanoma.	1.2729494355806832
Twelve patients with extensive lichen planus, resistant to different regimes of prior external and internal therapy, were treated with PUVA-bath photochemotherapy (psoralen bath followed by UVA irradiation) using bath water containing 0,5 mg/L of 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP).	1.1084366694697865
In 11 of the 12 patients, the skin lesions showed a significant improvement or even complete remission within six weeks of treatment.	1.166878222335873
In one patient, only limited clinical improvement could be achieved.	1.0660767242070937
A mean of 19,1 (SD +/- 3,6) PUVA-bath treatments were carried out.	1.1816706534658394
The mean cumulative UVA-dose given until clearance of the lichen planus was 16,7 (SD +/- 4,8) J/cm2.	1.067631657545421
No side effects were seen except an increased phototoxic reaction in two patients manifested as slight erythema.	0.9404717961157927
The results of this trial show, that PUVA-bath photochemotherapy with 8-MOP is an effective therapeutic alternative to all other known therapies in the treatment of extensive, exanthematic and also hypertrophic-hyperkeratotic lichen planus.	1.1188631114700958
In comparison to oral PUVA therapy and PUVA-bath therapy using 4,5',8-trimethoxypsoralen, balneophotochemotherapy with 8-MOP shows an excellent efficiency-side effect correlation.	0.9730464936655662
The clearance of the refractive skin lesions by balneophotochemotherapy with 8-MOP demonstrates the superiority of this therapy over all other common therapeutic modalities used for lichen planus.	0.9269632729970952
Critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) may occur in up to 70% of septic patients and multiple organ failure patients.	1.2054798674338785
Typical clinical signs of CIP are the difficulty to wean the patient from artificial respiration, a symmetrical flaccid quadriparesis/-plegia that is more pronounced in the distal parts of the limbs, reduced or absent deep tendon reflexes, and muscular atrophy.	1.1358276297324843
This article describes and discusses the clinical and electrophysiological features and clinical outcomes, physiopathological concepts, therapeutic implications, and the complex differential diagnosis of CIP from a neurological point of view, focusing on disorders of the nervous system and myopathic abnormalities.	1.1570641485833066
The data available in the literature were reviewed and compared to our own findings in order to deduce a clinical definition of CIP.	1.1338866918725012
It is a particular aim of this work to emphasize the crucial importance of electrophysiological investigation and monitoring in the classification of the nature and extent of neuromuscular disturbances in critically ill patients.	1.168418863855308
Myths about development during midlife are examined in the light of recent research studies.	0.8562965053957208
These studies show clearly, that midlife is a developmental phase of its own, the course of which can only slightly be predicted by previous development.	1.261912247747895
The assumption of a depressive crisis automatically occuring must be rejected as well as "positive myths" denying the evolving limitations in certain areas of life.	0.9534117495613016
Developmental tasks and developmental possibilities are described as well as the clinical concept of a phase-specific "return of the repressed".	1.1854575532390645
Possibilities of councelling and psychotherapy with couples during midlife are outlined.	0.6745528437075761
The general aspects for the analysis of malalignment of the low tibial region in the three-dimensional space are discussed.	0.9236932931929661
Recommendations for clinical and radiological diagnostics prior to low tibial osteotomies are given.	0.8070964579508805
Closing wedge, opening wedge, dome-shaped, distraction, rotational and step-shaped osteotomies as well as combined procedures are described.	0.8477436945901283
The possibilities of these techniques are pointed out for malalignment after lower leg, pilon and ankle fractures, as well as after trauma of the distal epiphysis of the tibia.	1.0374719408097057
Arthroscopy of the ankle is an additional tool for detailed planning of the adequate surgical procedure.	1.0783044583830175
The importance of determining an early correction cannot be underestimated.	0.7205258550272101
The original reason for using the German "Habilitation" degree to mean that a candidade had qualified and could conduct research and teach at a university is no longer really valid, as this is being threatened by its importance to further careers.	1.0475277464386823
Medical faculties must discuss how this development can be curtailed.	0.7206273506600646
In order to check the current situation, the Habilitation degree systems of 36 medical faculties of German universities were compared with the aid of a scoring system.	1.0736307433980794
Conformity existed only in the demand for a doctoral dissertation, scientific publications and a lecture on approval.	0.929903234223277
Concerning other criteria for qualification there was decreasing consensus in the following order: Habilitation thesis, commitment to teaching, further professional education, participation in congresses, inaugural lecture, qualification to teach, scientific activity, broad background in the discipline, and introduction to the faculty.	1.0071515623794502
Application of the scoring system with a maximum of 33 score points resulted in a mean value of 15.2 points and a range from 6 to 29 points.	1.0917547899929858
A significant decrease in the score values occurred with increasing age of the Habilitation degree (P = 0.002).	0.9526858115204138
Even if scoring systems are ambiguous and unfair, our analysis revealed serious differences in the quality of the Habilitation degree.	0.9463312354880486
Presuming that the German Habilitation degree should be maintained as a high-level qualification, we developed proposals that might be used to standardize this academic examination.	1.2120200488234425
Chronic reduction in uteroplacental blood flow causes intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR).	0.6910381008493284
In an animal model fetal umbilical perfusion in experimentally induced IUGR was examined.	0.7465639731291144
Pregnant sheep were instrumented with externally adjustable occluders on the common internal iliac artery to regulate uterine blood flow in the last third of gestation.	0.9742313212098483
Flow probes on the uterine arteries and the common umbilical artery provided blood flow measurements.	0.9043972534232769
Uterine blood flow was restricted in the group destined to become growth retarded whereas uterine blood flow in the equally instrumented controls was allowed to rise normally.	0.9882418773792535
When the experiment was terminated and morphometric data were obtained, uterine blood flow in controls was significantly higher than in restricted animals.	1.0171276100530966
Body weight and ponderal index in fetuses of flow-restricted mothers was significantly lower than in controls.	0.8140686913718399
Umbilical blood flow in IUGR animals was lower than in controls.	0.7788170306875678
The relation between uterine and umbilical blood flow became closer with advancing gestational age.	0.8102581147334885
Chronic reduction of uterine blood flow in late pregnant sheep causes IUGR accompanied by changes in umbilical blood flow which may be due to fetal adaptation.	0.9199939618585639
Four hundred and eighty-eight radical retropubic prostatectomies (RRP) were performed on clinically localized prostate cancer at one institution within 5 years (1992-1996).	0.9453346118348422
These were then analyzed regarding the migration of pathological tumor stages towards more localized stages.	0.8516350237521336
Within the observation period, the annual rate of RRP increased by 81 % from 69 to 125 cases.	1.1537218676127552
The authors noted a decline in the occurrence of advanced tumor stages (65.0 % to 39.2 %) and small cancers ( < 0.5 cc: 7.2 % to 1.6 %) and an increase in pathological T2 tumors (30.4 % to 55.2 %).	1.2507160261898744
The rate of positive surgical margins declined from 34.7 % to 12.8 % (for all pathological stages).	1.2752776442478277
These data confirm trends which were observed in the USA with increasing detection and treatment of localized prostate cancer.	1.1147837061493269
Prognostic assessment of acute global cerebral anoxia following cardiorespiratory arrest requiresa high level of clinical and technical diagnostic skills.	0.9328985193079069
Statements regarding prognosis of this form of coma can be made only with reference toa large number of clinical, neurophysiological, biochemical, and cerebral imaging data.	1.062551101057386
Previous research in this field has usually been restricted to only one or a few parameters such as clinical data, EEG findings, evoked potentials or biochemical markers.	0.9964570975149429
The present compilation of the various aspects regarding diagnosis and prognosis is intended to define the present state of the art in diagnosis and prognosis of anoxic coma, and also serve as a basis for a multicenter prospective study including all of the relevant data to improve diagnosis and arrive at guidelines for effective prognostication of anoxic coma.	1.163930275718209
In 96 patients (ductal pancreatic carcinoma, n = 34; periampullary carcinoma, n = 43; chronic pancreatitis, n = 19) the role of CA 19-9 in the diagnosis of lesions of the head of the pancreas were evaluated.	1.0551041933475536
The sensitivity for ductal pancreatic carcinoma was 73.3 %, for periampullary carcinoma 48.8 %, and specificity was 63.2 %.	1.1727995643987414
Carcinoembryonic antigen was elevated only in every fifth patient.	0.8106582490537073
Even when combining the two tumor markers no increase in sensitivity could be observed.	0.7851225310641569
The low specificity of 63 %, which decreased to 33 % in the case of obstructive jaundice, does not allow adequate preoperative differentiation between cancer patients and those with chronic pancreatitis.	1.198663796638534
In cases of postoperatively elevated CA 19-9 level the prognosis is worse than in patients with normal tumor markers.	0.9790592993436493
The management of neuromuscular foot deformities in children and adolescents must be individualized because of differences in etiology and pathomechanics.	0.9663634336293301
If conservative treatment fails or reaches a plateau early soft tissue procedures are recommended.	0.8201291017685445
Treatment should focus not only at correction of the deformity but also at reestablishment of muscular balance.	0.9382393038886837
Early postoperative mobilisation is usually possible provided adequate orthotic control is maintained.	0.7400095079785883
Regular clinical follow-ups help to minimize postoperative problems.	1.0065864908772617
The general aim should be an optimization of functions and only rarely to achieve a normal foot.	0.9631224413089843
The basic principles of management can be described as correction of deformity, stabilization of unstable joints and balance of muscle power.	0.9659570501403296
This study was carried out from 1986 to 1996 to evaluate the technique of translaminal epidural endoscopic discectomy in lumbar hernias occupying over 50% of the radicular canal, foraminal hernias, and hernias invading it entirely.	1.1180075313616944
This minimally invasive arthroscopic technique was applied in patients suffering from degenerative lumbar stenosis between L3 and S1.	0.7876805695599601
The first part of the study dealt with lumbar hernias.	0.8360423334658279
Of a total of 222 patients, 175 (78.82%) showed radicular canal invasion ranging between 50 and 90%.	1.102058425663955
The disc level was L4-L5 in 59%, L5-S1 in 39%, and L3-L4 in 4%.	1.0550976390496516
Most of these hernias were lateral extrusions.	0.8197925562016395
However, the study also included protrusions and foraminal hernias, since they were large and technically difficult to operate on.	1.0869416608175277
In terms of distribution,  25 patients (14.28%) had protrusions and 120 (68.57%) extrusions, and in 30 patients (17.14%) hernias had migrated.	1.4503013998359318
Surgery was carried out by the biportal posterior approach through the flaval ligament.	0.7828829060096468
An irrigation pump was used and the structures were under permanent accurate arthroscopic visualization.	0.8227835060397698
Good results were obtained in 96%, fair in 3%, and poor in 1%.	1.2621487373373734
The second part of the study dealt with lateral stenosis.	0.8029363703966308
Drawing from the experience gained by experiments performed in 1993 on five cadavers and by translaminar epidural endoscopy since 1986, this surgical technique was designed to provide decompression by resection of the ventral zone of the articular facet and, in some cases, foramenostomy.	1.0858223034254988
Of the 19 patients treated, nine presented with pathology in one segment, nine in two segments, and one in three segments.	1.161801924841365
All had lumbar and sciatic complaints, intermittent neurological claudication and predominantly lateral sensory motor deficit.	0.8120243717541641
The general results were good in 84% and fair in 16%.	1.100513783483471
The effects of "Care-insurance" on the situation of those in need of home care, is the object of first implementation-studies of SGB XI.	1.0935030883581285
They largely agree on the high level of satisfaction found among those who draw the benefits of the insurance scheme, particularly among those who claim a cash premium; further they largely agree on the low level of influence of the "Care-insurance" on changes in the form of nursing.	0.9626711731980451
An account of the results of the milieu-oriented "Freiburger Pflegestudie", which investigates the effects of "Care-insurance" differentiated according to the various types of care-situations, forms the centre of the article.	1.1392459569976154
A possible intraoperative complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy is opening of the gallbladder with subsequent loss of gallstones.	0.9975281053860533
We report on a 61-year-old woman who was hospitalised with an obscure subhepatic tumor.	0.8853717277367348
Intraoperatively an abscess was found that had been caused by lost gallstones following after laparoscopic cholecystectomy 3 years previously.	0.9575466615150102
There is a low incidence of late abscesses caused by loss of gallstones, but because of the long latency and unspecific symptoms there may be problems in diagnosis.	1.188407759661811
Taking into consideration possible complications caused by intraoperative loss of gallstones, all concrements should be retrieved, even though there is no indication for changing to an open procedure.	1.0934563029058015
Since squamous cell carinoma of the penis is rare, prospective trials do not exist.	0.9778056490443968
Therefore, new treatment strategies have to be developed.	1.2244065191703262
Based on our experience with the treatment of 22 patients with penile squamous cell carcinoma, we describe our therapeutic approaches.	1.1947386306677727
Ten patients with superficial disease (T1-2N0M0) were treated with partial penectomy.	1.101186028947748
The 3-year survival rate amounted to 90 %.	0.870666700837903
In patients with extensive disease (T3-4 or N1-3) a partial or total penectomy was performed.	1.1984655911617326
After initial antibiotic therapy for 4 weeks, patients underwent inguinal lymph-node dissection and if the nodes were positive, additional pelvic lymph-node dissection.	1.1504931401510652
In patients with ulcerous inguinal lymph-node metastases surgical resection was performed, covering the wound with a musculocutaneous flap (tensor fascia lata flap n = 2; rectus abdominis flap n = 1).	0.9077640920422965
The 3-year survival rate of patients with T1-2N1 tumours (n = 4) was 67 % and with T3-4N1-3 (n = 8) 25 %.	1.345382191872135
Patients with distant metastases received inductive systemic chemotherapy with cisplatin, methotrexate and bleomycin.	0.7698619588004377
Objective responses occurred in 22 % (1 CR, 1 PR) of 9 patients.	1.3795786734435198
These results suggest that immediate radical surgery with lymph-node dissection is the best treatment for squamous cell carcinoma of the penis.	1.1118378335397505
Biomechanical investigations in eight specimen elbow joints to test articulated external fixation showed correct extension-flexion joint position between 0 and 120 °.	0.8480319014483463
The central axis through the radial and ulnar condyles varies less than 3 ° in total.	0.8405261433523203
X-ray kinematography showed correct articulation in all cases without subluxation.	1.0210254018062077
In six patients with persistent subluxation and complex fracture of the proximal ulna external fixation with an additional articulation was placed.	1.1466227916058302
All patients began with physiotherapy on the 3rd day after operation, the range of joint motion was 0-30-95 ° in all cases, after 6 weeks 0-30-110 °.	1.0956285493603437
Additional articulated external fixation at the elbow joint can be an alternative treatment to long-term transfixation of the elbow in cases of complex injury.	1.1368702839831992
How important and predicative are clinical parameters and locoregional failure after radical radiotherapy of oropharyngeal carcinomas for the probability of the occurrence of distant metastases?	0.8972244535507687
From 1 August 1990 to 1 October 1998, 139 patients with carcinomas of the oropharynx were treated in a prospective study by radical radiotherapy and evaluated in regard to the clinical parameters reflex-otalgia, predominant structure of tumor growth, T-category, presence of involved lymph nodes, and smoking and drinking habits.	1.1083610028279773
Twenty-nine patients received a concomitant chemotherapy.	1.0038222020498642
Twenty-five out of 139 patients had a planned neck dissection after completion of radiotherapy.	0.9241820890360631
Ten patients received a salvage operation.	0.7436851604144212
The median follow-up time was 24 months (range, 4 to 74).	0.9993245923041043
Two- and 5-year overall survival rates according to Kaplan Meier were 56.1 and 49.6%.	1.147898233001792
The tumors were controlled in 77/139 patients (55%).	0.8031153734501894
The therapy failed in 62/139 patients (45%).	0.8393676735995707
Both groups, 62 patients with locoregional therapy failure and 77 patients with locoregionally controlled tumors, were comparable in regard to performance status (Karnofsky index), age, gender, TNM-categories, histological differentiation, drinking habits, pretherapeutic diagnostics, total dose (Gy), and number of simultaneous chemotherapy cycles.	1.0630405541665884
Locoregional tumor control was significantly determined by the parameters reflex-otalgia (p < 0.0078), predominant growth pattern (p < 0.012), T-category (p < 0.03), and smoking (p < 0.0285).	1.1130697837050052
The median survival time of patients with locoregional failure is 17 months.	1.000637436141708
At this moment 81% of locoregionally controlled patients are still alive.	1.069586962205562
In 14/62 patients (23%) with locoregional failure, distant metastases were detectable against 4/77 (5%) of locally controlled patients, p < 0.0026.	1.2031293882040255
Probability of local control and distant metastases, predominantly pulmonary, reached a plateau after 24 months.	0.9128361785260587
Locoregional tumor control, determined by several clinical parameters, is an important parameter for the probability of the development of distant metastases.	1.0534096780530213
Failure of local therapy is caused by the biologic aggressiveness of the tumor.	0.8413998907486722
Telemedicine includes all medical activities in diagnosis, therapeutics, or social medicine undertaken by means of an electronic transfer medium, enabling the transmission of visual and acoustic information over long distances to doctors not personally present at the place of the requested consultation.	0.9751708479547512
The aim of this study was to evaluate the retropatellar pressure, force, and contact area in cases of knee arthroplasty compared to knees without arthroplasty.	0.9397095048154844
We examined six leg specimens before and after knee arthroplasty.	0.7287329493012618
The modified Thiel fixation was used, and arthroplasty was the Genesis I without patellar implant (Fa.	0.8894609457573646
Smith & Nephew, Schenefeld).	0.5100313322513162
Contact measurements were performed with pressure-sensitive film (Fuji Prescale type "super low") in 45 °, 60 °, 90 °, and 120 ° knee flexion.	1.1236961634091018
The results were evaluated with special software, "Pressure Imaging and Analyzing System FPD-901 Series".	1.1309840932976294
The leg was exarticulated in the hip joint and the knee joint was opened from a suprapatellar approach.	1.0804161105131467
The film was placed at a defined area between the facies patellaris of the femur and facies articularis of the patella.	0.9643483492886413
Instantaneous pressure was measured during a time of 5-s pressure increase and a further 5 s. A force of 280 N was applied to the quadriceps muscle.	1.1654758553352416
Before knee arthroplasty, the contact area measured 154.3 mm2, the average pressure was 1.14 MPa, the force 182.13 N. After knee arthroplasty, the contact area was 119.94 mm2, the average pressure 1.522 MPa, the force 180.98 N. Following knee arthroplasty the contact area decreased significantly (P=0.015), and the average (P=0.0001) and maximum pressure (P=0.0003) increased significantly.	1.26962958752611
The force did not change significantly (P=0.7642).	0.8712754862076875
The choice of the knee arthroplasty implant and approach to the knee joint should be considered in order to achieve an increased retropatellar contact area thus preventing smaller contact areas than before knee arthroplasty.	1.2725132520035396
The increased contact area could also prevent increasing retropatellar pressures after knee arthroplasty and further complications.	0.8196514469865261
Maculopathy occurring in young patients is a challenge in differenzial diagnosis.	0.970276628809617
Besides hereditary macular dystrophies and acquired macular degenerations, rare systemic disorders should be considered.	0.8156237872489313
Histological examination of 1660 biopsies (2 - 5 mm) of the synovial membrane of 317 patients were obtained by arthroscopic dissection; in 70% of all cases non-specific changes were revealed and in 30% specific changes.	1.3577907745755502
The findings included different stages of proliferation of the superficial layer, uncharacteristic inflammatory reactions of the stratum synoviale and fibrosis of the stroma, vascular proliferation and pseudopolypoid thickening of the synovial membrane.	0.9753498151031431
The histomorphological findings can only be interpreted reliably and a pathogenetic classification obtained, e.g., detritus synovialitis, rheumatoid arthritis or post-traumatic changes, if the arthroscopic findings conclude an exact documentation of the biopsy site and the clinical findings.	1.0569935342745134
The aim of this study was to determine the impact of prolonged single lung ventilation and intrathoracic insufflation of CO2 during computer-enhanced totally endoscopic bypass grafting on biventricular myocardial function.	0.8513119610404679
Methods: Transesophageal echocardiography was performed intraoperatively in 20 patients undergoing the above mentioned operation.	1.1724358023223158
At distinct time points during the intervention, a cine-loop of both ventricles was registered employing a mid short axis view.	0.9164488650984671
Simultaneously, oxygenation parameters as well as electrocardiographic data and intrathoracic CO2 pressure were taken.	0.9704455981755151
Wall motion analysis was done postoperatively.	0.75493753271047
Results: With increasing duration of single lung ventilation, significant regional and global biventricular hypokinesia was detected.	1.080784943802473
This was accompanied by a decrease in PaO2 and a marked increase in intrathoracic CO2 pressure.	0.7828728686436284
These alterations disappeared after weaning from extracorporeal circulation and reconstitution of double lung ventilation.	0.7340832550153463
Conclusion: These results show that computer-enhanced coronary artery bypass grafting leads to significant alterations in intraoperative biventricular myocardial function.	1.2139053925292598
This can be due to either an impact on oxygenation during single lung ventilation or due to intrathoracic CO2 insufflation.	0.9017260235260567
However, in our group, these alteration showed only small clinical relevance.	1.368175058665966
During the last few years the fast development of different laser and laser-like systems for photoepilation and their one-sided representation in media has led to confusion among pysicians and patients.	0.9442966581086079
The object of this review is to give a structured report of different pulsed laser and laser-like systems (Epilight, Photoderm, long-pulsed ruby-, alexandrite- and diodelaser) that are available in Germany, including their side effects and complications.The current status of scientific investigation in this field is discussed.	1.228499274806988
The purpose of the present study was to increase the free range of motion in conventional trust-plate prosthesis design and to optimize the trust-plate contact as well as the osteointegration area below the trust-plate.	1.1084545126106498
Although familial occurrence of fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) has been commonly observed, data on a genetic role in this condition are limited.	1.119353594187554
A few studies have reported familial aggregation and association with HLA.	0.8648015621331395
We have studied genetic linkage of FMS with HLA in multicase families, and found a rather weak linkage of FMS with HLA (P<0.029).	1.0319002667574095
Malformations of the urinary tract are one of the most common types of anomalies in the neonatal period.	1.0084726831594595
Approximately 15-20% of all prenatally detected malformations  require acute postnatal imaging.	1.1875169764730165
Sonography is the primary imaging modality in the evaluation of nephro-urologic problems in infancy.	0.8784667377727517
Hydronephrosis represents the most common pathology, followed by multicystic-dysplastic kidney.	1.0059187059999415
Discussion: The result of the sonographic examination directs further imaging.	1.2822865773923726
An adequate diagnostic algorithm is decisive  for accurate diagnosis, for the appropriate therapeutic regimen and for the prognosis  of the patients.	1.2759370560293928
Calcification is one of the main causes of failure of porcine bioprosthetic heart valves, a problem which has not been satisfactorily solved to date.	1.0690712348710472
Previous studies have shown that calcification is decreased in porcine heart valves that have undergone treatment for lipid extraction.	0.9468854441040696
The relation between lipid distribution and calcification of seven new commercially available porcine bioprosthetic heart valves (St. Jude Medical, Bioimplant) is assessed by Sudan red III staining to show preexisting lipids.	0.9648107895032597
All porcine bioprosthetic valves contained lipids to different degrees.	0.6890534278794809
Five valves were subjected to the pulsatile accelerated calcification process for 4 weeks.	0.6825053894773843
Distribution and level of calcification were evaluated by radiography and compared to the Sudan red-stained fatty areas.	0.8855949129746706
Comparison of the calcifications detected by radiography and the macroscopically detected lipids showed a coincidence of 57-66%.	0.8564180339514759
Two porcine bioprosthetic valves were histologically prepared and stained with Hematoxylin and von Kossa's stain, respectively.	0.7249936228130968
By light microscopy, the von Kossa staining revealed microcalcifications and polarizing microscopic investigation showed birefractive substances in areas with lipid deposits.	0.9082408090478532
These preexisting substances in porcine valve tissue may play a determinative role in the calcification of the tissue.	0.8594833857839248
Substantial studies are necessary to further determine the role of preexisting lipids in calcification.	0.8737822556718519
Therapy for hip dysplasia and DDH by means of sonography.	0.7236281123535258
Numerous methods are available for treating "congenital" dysplasia of the hip (CDH).	1.035914210020625
The important point seems to be the differentiation between dysplastic hip joints with and without displaced femoral heads.	1.0410928408654982
A historical review of the diagnosis of so-called "congenital dysplasia" and dislocation of the hip and different indications for therapeutic maneuvers is given.	1.14621970136033
Generally, a three-step plan of treatment is recommended: dislocated heads must be reduced, after which retention is needed until the hip joint is stable.	1.243565590657328
This is followed by maturation period, until the nonossified hyalin cartilagineous performed acetabular roof is ossified.	0.7047580640070215
All hip joints, regardless of age, can be assigned to one of these phases.	1.0333288576151276
In all cases, measures are taken to prevent ischemic necrosis of the femoral head.	0.8207096652694789
To prevent the residual dysplasia of the acetabulum roof and femoral head necrosis, the reduction-retention position should be more than 90  ° flexion in the hip joint, but not more than 45-50  ° abduction.	1.284428109068419
In each therapeutic phase there is a different biomechanical situation in the hip joint.	0.8556836785065214
The appropriate orthosis for treatment is chosen according to the particular biomechanical situation.	0.8457051421455939
Each sonographic type can be set up according to the our classification in the three-phase treatment system.	0.9884009231966226
In this way the adequate orthosis for treatment in each treatment-phase can be chosen.	1.0538686587066037
A case of a patient with malignant acanthosis nigricans in association with carcinoma of the lung is reported, documenting successful palliative treatment of the warty papillomatous thickening of the lips with electrocautery.	1.0686789783730901
Molecular atmospheric oxygen contains two unpaired electrons in the unreactive triplet state and thus has to be activated in order to react with other biological molecules in the singlet ground state.	0.8718412020099167
These processes of activation include very reactive intermediates.	0.6466126351858912
Therefore, aerobic cells must cope with - and to some extent also adapt to - oxidative stress provoked for example by infection or intoxication, where reactive intermediates of oxygen activation accumulate.	1.272324287167151
Depending on the strength of these impacts, several symptoms indicate the deviation from normal, steady-state metabolism.	0.9650741484855349
Most of these visible or measurable symptoms are connected with oxygen activation where principally a transition from heterolytic reactions (two-electron transitions) to increased homolytic reactions (one-electron transitions) is observed.	1.0598920807524053
Homolytic reactions produce free radicals, which are generally counteracted by a parallel increase of intrinsic radical scavenging processes or by compounds administered with food, thus warranting metabolic control within certain limits.	1.0349991330786452
At advanced states of stress, control may be gradually lost and chaotic radical processes dominate.	0.8163678975043323
Finally, cellular decompartmentalizations yield apoptotic, lytic and/or necrotic processes.	0.9535914963825097
Every episode during this cascade is characterizable by the balance between pro- and antioxidative capacities.	0.8901581094390321
Antioxidants, which in many cases are free radical scavengers or quenchers of activated states, comprise a wealth of classes of organic molecules including phenolics, probably as the most prominent ones.	1.1324874493596628
In this article, mechanisms of oxygen activation and protection from oxidative damage are discussed.	0.8550527968529091
Furthermore, examples of antioxidative functions of a few important natural products are reported.	1.1078300796126082
In a monocenter prospective randomized double-blind clinical trial the efficacy of homeopathic treatment was investigated on children with adenoid vegetations justifying an operation.	0.905062907371335
Patients were treated with either homeopathic remedies such as Nux vomica D200, Okoubaka D3, Tuberculinum D200, Barium jodatum D4 and Barium jodatum D6 or with placebo.	0.843211025257044
The duration of the study for each patient was 3 months.	1.4135157325851802
Examination of the ears using a microscope, rhinoscopy, stomatoscopy and pharyngoscopy, as well as tympanometry and audiometry were performed after 4, 8 and 12 weeks.	0.9773326452552951
Out of a total of 97 children studied between the ages of 4 to 10 years 82 could be analyzed.	0.9419796154576697
At the end of the study no operation was required in 70.7% of the placebo-treated children and in 78.1% of the children treated with homeopathic preparations.	1.3537085195332366
These results show no statistical significance.	0.9714443466439623
A treatment technique favorable for linacs with asymmetric jaws, which combined cranio-caudal matching fields with fields enclosing the whole target volume, is investigated with respect to field matching and sparing of normal tissue and organs at risk.	0.8495167192276202
For a pelvic target volume rapidly varying in cranio-caudal direction a 5-field technique was planned with individually weighted and blocked fields.	0.889867432078028
Three fields adjoining in cranio-caudal direction were completed by 2 fields enclosing the whole target volume.	0.7088046992016935
The matching line was measured and calculated with Helax TMS©.	0.8520949780583649
Furthermore a 4-field box and opposing fields were planned.	0.7277813588543559
The dose-volume histograms for target, bladder, intestine and soft tissue were exported.	0.9355167228666715
Normal tissue complication probability and tumor control probability, respectively, were calculated for all techniques.	1.0770395323668713
In the region of the matching line the summation of the measured normalized curves resulted in relative dose maxima of 6.0% (caudal) and 4.5% (cranial), respectively.	1.1344280947295444
For fields enclosing the whole target volume the dose maxima in the region of the matching line decreased to 2.0% (caudal) and 1.8% (cranial), respectively.	1.065732029729253
For the dose profiles calculated with Helax TMS© no overdose was found.	0.7228904918744029
The 5-field technique with adjoining fields results in a better sparing of the organs at risk compared to the other techniques, whereas the tumor control remains the same.	1.18709780454702
In specific cases a technique with cranio-caudal adjoining fields can be recommended with respect to sparing of normal tissue and organs at risk.	0.8584278114444059
Disseminated Langerhans-cell-histiocytosis (LCH) is most frequent in children at the age of 1-3 years, seldomly seen in adults and extremely rare in the elderly.	1.179204556744108
The clinical course may be acute, subacute or chronic, progressive or stationary.	1.0505152859100617
Spontaneous remissions are possible, but rare.	1.0133422952484494
In elderly patients often the disease is at first limited to the skin before it becomes systemic.	1.1642793161256404
Because of its central location, the elbow joint is considered the most important joint within the upper extremity from the viewpoint of function.	1.2122549077296307
Trauma to osseous and ligamentous structures of the proximal forearm confronts trauma surgeons and orthopedic specialists with numerous diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.	0.965867917011143
Conditions following elbow trauma are often accompanied by chronic pain and diminished range of motion, leading to functional deficits of the entire arm.	1.056289694793062
There is now practically no doubt that primary osteosynthesis, anatomical joint reconstruction and early onset of functional treatment are essential for a good final outcome.	1.0402055227980433
With our expanding knowledge of the anatomical and biomechanical condtions in the proximal lower arm in the last few decades the basic principles of therapy have also changed, and current standards of treatment for proximal forearm trauma are presented in this paper with reference to the relevant literature.	1.2554271343898826
The series of five patients with symptomatic isolated right ventricular outflow tract ectopy and no structural heart disease which were successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation of the ectopic focus are reported in order to discuss radiofrequency ablation as an alternative treatment in patients with right ventricular outflow tract ectopy without ventricular tachycardia.	1.0828535474489602
Basic principles for treating patients with chronic pain are presented.	1.0700687051502003
They are the result of a longterm collaboration of collegues from different medical specialties in the pain outpatient unit of the University of Ulm.	1.016349530724998
In contrast to a variety of literature on chronic pain patients, these principles focus on the contribution of the therapists to the development of problems in treatment.	1.1669478055303246
Eight principles, considered especially important for the treatment of chronic pain patients are presented and discussed.	1.0599987007389557
We discuss this entity with the aid of a case report and the existing literature.	1.1398246458840087
The therapy of these tumors includes resection and possible adjuvant radiotherapy.	1.0590513214110586
Rhabdomyosarcomas are an exception, because they also show a good response to chemotherapy.	1.1259344109994405
14 human femurs were scanned by CAT and 3D reconstructed.	0.622645808467489
In every specimen digital documentation of CCD and antetorsion (AT) angle was performed.	0.8206554907731335
With a special software package (Orthodoc) virtual preoperative planning for implantation of a cementless total hip alloplasty was undertaken.	0.928898387305534
The specimens were randomised into two groups, one of which had manual and the other one robot implantation of the femoral component.	1.284625697156543
After implantation all specimens were evaluated again by CAT and CCT and AT angle were documented again.	0.8397036818561346
The preoperative CCD angle was 126.7  ° (SD = 4.0) in the manual group and 127.8  ° (SD = 4.3) in the robodoc group.	1.08133268147646
Postoperatively the angle averaged 131.9  ° (SD = 0.8) in the manual group and 133.2  ° (SD = 1.9) in the robodoc group.	1.1560702201202433
Significant differences were found for the AT angle in both groups.	0.9590866236636435
The preoperative AT angle in the manual group was 31.3  ° (SD = 8.8), decreasing to 20.5  ° (SD = 9.5) after implantation.	1.1765938153179494
In the robodoc group this angle was 30.9  ° (SD = 8.0) before and 31.3  ° (SD = 8.7) after implantation.	1.0242089609468
The difference between pre- and postoperative AT angle averaged 10.8  ° (SD = 6.4) in the manual group and only 0.4  ° (SD = 0.9) in the robodoc-group.	1.3295525044697944
Conclusion: With the technique used, preoperative planning in hip alloarthroplasty is much more accurate than with the conventional technique with plain X-ray.	1.2719264857372379
The virtual preoperative planning can be transferred to the intraoperative setting with high precision.	0.8824888295437211
These factors may lead to an increase in outcome quality.	0.7932708056787383
1000 drug-related fatalities that were examined in Hamburg from 1990-1996 by the Institute of Legal Medicine were analysed with respect to consumption of substitute drugs such as methadone.	0.9481655013906376
The incidence of methadone-related fatalities has increased in the last two years.	1.2340041505811352
The highest incidence was found in 1995 when methadone was detected in the blood of about 20% of all drug-related fatalities.	1.1936303422362617
Lethal monointoxications or combined intoxications with a dominant role of methadone were experienced rarely (about 1% of all drug-related fatalities).	1.05542699182485
Of the persons who were enroled since 1990 in a methadone maintenance programme 2% have been registered as drug- related fatalities.	1.0592942769228448
The mortality of street addicts without comparable medical help was about 10% in the same period.	1.0585755368944851
There is further need for improved methods of registration, documentation and forensic/sociological analysis of all drug-related fatalities for reliable conclusions concerning mortality rates of drug users who are enroled in methadone maintenance programmes.	0.9463365375044275
Pulmonary infections and tumors are a major cause of death in patients with AIDS.	0.9350350110293413
The combination of clinical, radiological, laboratory, and pathohistological data helps to narrow the spectrum of differential diagnoses or even allows a specific diagnosis in many patients.	0.9776394869291998
Nevertheless, an accurate diagnosis should be obtained as soon as possible during the clinical course of the illness to initiate treatment in time.	1.3165806560846218
Computed tomography (CT) has proven to provide promising results in the diagnosis of AIDS-related thoracic diseases.	1.0467538549955935
The aim of this paper was to demonstrate the diagnostic capacities of CT in the context of particular AIDS-related thoracic pathologies.	1.0916910809010156
Additional information on the spectrum of pathological agents and on differential diagnostic signs is summarized.	0.9321649522268509
This study was designed to provide information to which extend home-based nursing care services for the elderly take part in the care for older people with mental disorders.	1.1048335542708194
Also of interest was the involvement of clinical facilities and services of the geropsychiatric treatment system in the health care for the clients.	0.8790742884950901
A one day data collection in 29 nursing care services in two North Rhine-Westphalian regions could raise informations about 1,246 clients aged 60 years and over 1, 522 persons (41.8%) had a mental disorder, diagnosed by a nursing and/or medical professional.	1.0365695593657192
68% of the mental disordered clients had dementia or a demential disorder, 6% a functional psychoses, and 31% a neurotic, psychogenic disorder or substance abuse (small number of clients with two and more diagnoses).	1.1924110114593567
82% of clients with mental disorders had one or more additional somatic disease(s).	0.8725708481374763
These diseases were mostly the cause for the involvement of home-based nursing care service.	0.883393012271101
Barely 8% of clients with mental disorders were placed from clinical facilities and services of the geropsychiatric treatment system into the nursing care services.	0.8876252956380085
Beside the home-based care, only 12% of mental disordered received clients outpatient psychiatric treatment.	1.1654553730749282
Systematic cooperation between the nursing care services and the system of (gero-) psychiatric treatemnt was a rare exception.	1.1865926168149923
Acute cerebral nerve paresis can be caused in many different ways.	0.9517669783588674
One of the more rare causes of paresis of one or more neural pathways is dissection of the internal carotid artery.	0.9322892119701723
Early diagnosis is important, even with atypical symptoms, since prompt anticoagulative therapy can hinder stroke from embolism due to the dissection.	1.1236753541030282
We report on two patients with Raeder's syndrome and Collet-Sicard syndrome resulting from dissection of the internal carotid artery.	0.8082162483703723
Besides the cranial and caudal nerves involved in our study, loss of function has also been reported with the sixth to eighth cranial nerves, so that any painful, sudden cranial nerve deficiency can indicate possible carotid dissection.	1.0056814594242673
In hematopoiesis, regulation and differentiation present a very complex functional network in which multiple factors of the microenvironment are involved.	0.9584218435746962
In addition to direct cell-to-cell contacts and the modifying influences of the intercellular matrix, soluble mediators play an important role in intercellular communication.	1.0238131772464054
Cytokines exert their effects by binding with specific receptors that transfer their signals to individual cells.	0.8366613240423848
A common structure shared by subunits of these receptors leads to competitive inhibition in binding the cytokines with different affinity.	0.8524425240440143
By this mechanism specificity is reduced, on the one hand; however, on the other the complexity of interactions in the bone marrow is enhanced.	1.2270408080955533
A flood of in vitro and in vivo studies have established the impact of various cytokines on single hematopoietic cell lineages and their application for clinical use.	0.8902989380619017
However, there is a lack of knowledge concerning the cellular origin of the cytokines.	0.987637719688414
According to the results of our studies elements of the erythro- and megakaryopoiesis are the source of cytokines like IL-1, IL-3, IL-6, and GM-CSF.	1.1595955424868027
Wound healing represents a dynamic process of increasing scientific interest, especially with the detection of the different growth factors.	1.1765948790468466
Economic aspects are also of importance in the investigation of substances used for wound healing.	1.0186672963370906
In Germany 25% of all patients (ca.	0.8864778098632485
1 million) with severe chronic venous insufficiency have crural ulcers.	1.0563467534902409
The influence of bacterial infection of crural ulcers is controversial.	0.8282135825073866
There is no doubt that the quantity of bacteria is of importance.	0.8610359012868578
Local antibiotic treatment is difficult, as most of the substances used are known to inhibit wound healing.	1.240342282983808
In vivo and in vitro investigations showed, that chiniofon-containing antiseptic has a bacteriostatic function.	0.9784992295401469
Additionally it was shown, using cultures of fibroblasts, that chiniofon-containing antiseptic does not inhibit the growth of fibroblasts, whereas PVP-iodine solution, a widely used antiseptic, clearly reduces the growth of fibroblasts.	1.0577347476486065
The good clinical results in the treatment of acute and chronic radiation damage indicate that chiniofon-containing antiseptic may have antiflammatory activity.	1.011780740400197
This article presents the heuristics concerning description of individual generative behavior.	0.7790309076197658
The aim is to describe the development of the desire for children, the generative action and the dealing with generative decisions for intended and unintended childless women and men as well as parents.	0.996243588496954
The main emphasis of the existing heuristics is placed on psychological questions.	0.7760344188013957
These heuristics explain patterns and influencing factors of generative action as well as positive and negative influencing factors of the coping process.	0.9410521034081891
It may be helpful to use heuristics which describe development of and coping with generative action as background information to ensure comprehensive consultation and therapy planning.	0.9640867390636113
Morbus Parkinson is a progressive degenerative disease of the human central, peripheral, and enteric nervous systems.	1.09850405958418
In the course of the disease, not only the substantia nigra, but also extranigral components of the motor system, as well as numerous limbic system and autonomic centers undergo serious damage.	1.0572633749914377
Accordingly, Parkinson's disease is a multisystem disorder.	1.2122789369153735
Only specific types of projection neurons fall victim to it.	0.670380260923563
The first manifestation of the pathological process which causes the disease are abnormalities of the neuronal cytoskeleton.	0.9993234007546327
Intracytoplasmic inclusions evolving in the form of Lewy bodies in perikarya and Lewy neurites in the neuronal processes result in premature cell death of the affected neurons.	0.9014903310904971
On the basis of this selective neuronal vulnerability, a categorization emerges of the pathological changes within the nervous system and corresponding functional impairments.	1.0286010005953607
Introduction: Children with "nursing bottle syndrome" and long standing teeth destructions and no treatment so far were examined for accompanying pathological changes in the bacterial flora of the mouth and alterations due to chronic inflammation of the oral mucosa and the alveolar jawbone.	1.2058159423534962
Osteomyelitis is an infection of the bone marrow caused by both non-specific and specific agents.	1.0766827926195628
Non-specific endogenic osteomyelitis represents the most frequent form, followed by the specific form caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.	1.0639571874792402
Typically, the non-specific form occurs in children and young adults, and the sites most frequently affected are the distal and the proximal ends of the tibia and femur.	1.338636152234966
In tuberculosis, osteomyelitis is predominantly located in the vertebral bodies.	0.9575956688916295
In rare cases osteomyelitis can be caused by viruses, fungi or echinococcus.	0.7740137457368209
It may also occur as so-called acute endogenic osteomyelitis, such as plasmocellular osteomyelitis and Brodie's abscess.	0.9727935689143673
Histologically, dense infiltration of leucocytes, granulation tissue and bone sequesters can be seen.	1.0516605225149018
In tuberculosis granulomas with central necrosis, epithelioid cells and giant cells of Langhans type are characteristically found.	0.7863578524497364
Most forms of acute osteomyelitis can be successfully treated with antibiotics, leading to complete healing without complications.	1.107304858513427
Only a few reported cases develop into a secondary, chronic form.	1.0612825147285503
Precision of osteodensitometric measurements using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) depends on various known factors, such as positioning, aortic calcification or vertebral fractures.	0.9195873035335156
The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of various diseases or bone density on the reproducibility of measurements in the lumbar spine and the proximal femur.	1.0838729599893508
Measurements in the LWS p.a., LWS lat.	0.9647258336254879
and at Ward's triangle were made in a total of 100 patients.	0.9775801571343861
The subjects were repositioned between measurements.	0.5999238441687866
In order to be able to determine the influence of various diseases, four groups of 25 patients each were formed: three with the diagnosis osteoarthrosis, osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis and one control group.	1.1563056356037387
The mean percentual difference and coefficient of variation were calculated as the measure for reproducibility.	0.7822943000430396
Mean percentual differences of 0.18 to 2.6% were found in the four groups at the three measurements sites.	1.3555025272979202
After calculation of coefficient of variation, a value between 1.2 and 2.7% was found for LWS p.a., between 7.1 and 15.7% for LWS lat.	1.4739581945173197
and between 4.1 and 9.9% at Ward's triangle.	1.3600767737457566
It was also conspicuous that the difference in coefficient of variation in osteoporosis patients was nearly double that in the control group in all measured areas.	1.0647967148700284
Conclusion: Lateral lumbar spinal measurements using DEXA cannot presently be recommended.	1.0322302825264968
measurements and, with limitations, measurements at Ward's triangle have good precision and could be used for course documentation of bone density.	1.0722483648686094
Background: We compared the endothelial protective function of two hyaluronic acid viscoelastics (Healon GV, Provisc) of different molecular weight and viscosity during phakoemulsification in high-risk eyes.	1.118106415581078
Diseases of the peripheral nervous system occur in up to 50% of persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).	0.933132738047958
In early stages of the infection, Guillain-Barré syndrome or a spontaneously remitting mononeuropathy can occur.	0.7930448165444901
The most frequent occurrence is distal symmetrical polyneuropathy associated with HIV, which can only be treated symptomatically.	1.1252201726660866
The most important differential diagnosis is a drug-induced polyneuropathy under antiretroviral therapy with the nucleoside analogues DDI, DDC, or D4T.	1.1173249739679794
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy is less common and can be treated with immunoglobulins or corticosteroids.	0.9400634980156284
Very rare are steroid-responsive neuropathies with necrotizing vasculitis or in diffuse infiltrative lymphocytosis syndrome (DILS).	0.7859018376630285
In the AIDS stage, polyradiculitis can occur due to opportunistic infections - most often with cytomegalovirus (CMV) or M. tuberculosis - or polyradiculopathies due to lymphomatous meningiosis.	1.120866189963252
Mononeuritis multiplex is rarely seen in disseminated CMV infection.	0.7656230084576505
Myopathies can occur in all stages of HIV infection; their frequency is about 1%.	1.0884213095987807
Primary polymyositis associated with HIV, which can be treated with corticosteroids or immunoglobulin, must be distinguished from myopathy induced by azidothymidine.	0.9398216145293337
Other forms of myopathy are very rare.	0.634870786784199
54 patients, who had been explored at the end of their treatment including a psychosomatic approach in a medical department of a general hospital, were interviewed again in their homes three months later.	1.2099919510062374
Contentment with treatment was high in the inpatient and outpatient setting, the ill felt only moderately stressed by their illnesses, showed an adaptive constellation of coping styles and were surprisingly well adapted.	1.0091146062916079
The comparison between the two measures showed a less favourable view of the patients three months after discharge from hospital at a quarter of the tested parameters, the variability was high in the scales, that were used.	1.304226987925224
Explanations for these results are discussed.	0.8289902938840719
At a long term perspective coping with illness may be improved especially by interventions of the family doctors.	1.0444429033196816
Health care costs have risen considerably since 1970 in all industrialized countries.	0.8328531854410829
This has several causes: changes in demographic structure, the large number of physicians, increased personnel needs resulting from generous vacation and special leave privileges, wage increases and - last but not least - medical progress.	1.0372005751921536
Advances in medical technology are often regarded as one of the main reasons for spiralling costs in health care.	0.9491432787729108
Careful analyses reveal, however, that the high costs of imaging services are due to conventional radiography rather than to high-technology (CT, MR) imaging.	1.2273729844473626
The legitimate demands for cost reduction have to be met with improved cost efficiency while optimal quality standards must also be maintained.	0.8915147606311548
Relevant suggestions, such as generally accepted examination strategies, should be realized with the help of the scientific societies.	1.0007997864690903
Background: Main features of the Coffin-Siris syndrome are mental retardation and absent or hypoplastic nails of the fifth fingers and toes.	0.9861572109962279
Further symptoms are wide mouth with prominent lips, sparse scalp hair, and hypertrichosis.	0.9194650105957977
We report on two premature infants who had completed 25 and 29 weeks of gestation and who developed unilateral interstitial pulmonary emphysema.	1.094196404814223
In both cases massive mediastinal displacement developed with compression and total atelectasis of the contralateral lung.	0.9732243942935083
By selective intubation of the respective main bronchus, complete ventilation of the collapsed lungs and sufficient gas exchange was achieved.	0.978219977636404
After 3 days (case 1) and after 6 days) case 2), the unilateral emphysema receded and, subsequently, bilateral respiration was possible without relapse.	1.235306933237169
6 and respectively 11 days after selective intubation, extubation was performed.	0.7855794789957132
The two children were discharged at the age of 41/2 and 21/2 months showing complete respiratory compensation and equal ventilation on both sides.	0.9787572568405544
Patient with extensive keratosis palmoplantaris maculosa seu papulosa (Davies-Colley) presented with multiple cutaneous horns.	0.803299114179336
The clinical picture, the histology, the electro microscopic examination, the negative tumor screening and the viral classification in the tissue allowed the differentiation from other palmoplantar keratoses.	1.1987428706781331
The patient was treated successfully using a combination of acitretin with physical and chemical measures.	0.9992033104287936
Epidemiologic studies have shown that trace concentrations of inhalation anaesthetics polluting the air of operating theatres could have deleterious effects on the personnel's health.	0.8278928274640424
Nitrous oxide (N2O) oxidises vitamin B12 and thus decreases DNA production by inactivation of methionine synthase.	0.7419164752393704
Therefore, the United States and most European health authorities recommend threshold values to protect against potential health risks.	0.9784421661957046
These values range from 25 to 100 ppm, expressed as time-weighted averages (TWA).	0.8856055097505837
There is a lack of data concerning measurements of trace concentrations under defined conditions.	0.8010321341524113
The aim of this study was to quantify levels of N2O in a recovery room (RR) with an air conditioning system.	1.0578329718306352
The blood loss during the acute period after complex pelvic trauma is finally responsible for the high mortality associated with this specific type of injury.	1.1366783540111935
Several protocols have been published for optimized management, but up to now comparable data are not available as no exact definitions exist judging the severty of trauma and blood loss.	1.1295413181917284
As part of a prospective study 19 patients after unstable pelvic injuries with unstable circulation underwent emergency stabilization by the pelvic C-clamp.	1.0892260966116534
Beside standard clinical parameter the initial hemoglobin value was converted into a "bloodvolume equivalent".	0.8620912362888131
18 of the 19 patients had an injury severety according to group III and IV of the Hannover Polytrauma Score (PTS).	0.9993994138762546
Concommitant abdominal injuries were seen in 12 cases (23 injuries), concommitant urological injuries in 12 cases (14 injuries).	1.118211969476602
In 13 cases the pelvis was the major source of bleeding in 9 cases an additional intraabdominal hemorrhage was observed.	0.9836622153756766
11 patients died due to sequelae of their injury, 8 patients survived.	0.9800311264143566
Although the initial blood loss was comparable both in the group of the deceased patients and the survivors, a 44% higher subsequent blood substitution (= 10 089 ml) was observed in the nonsurvivor group.	1.2802847736369545
In conclusion the data proofed that early control of hemorrhage is fundamental for the prognoses after complex pelvic trauma.	0.8803994255276976
The estimation of the blood loss may help in indicating agressive emergency procedures like emergency stabilisation, pelvic clamps, surgical exploration and tamponade.	1.1011759424772978
This calculation may be a basis for a more detailed analyses of this devastating injury and judging the benefit of different management protocols.	1.0554480742081986
In contrast to childhood intussusception, the clinical signs of intussusception in adults are nonspecific.	1.1663787931058307
Generally organic alterations of the small bowel cause intussusception in adults.	0.8962653270936358
In this case report on a retrograde jejunojejunal intussusception in a 61-year-old male, following removal of an intraoperatively placed intestinal tube for ileus therapy, the clinical symptoms, diagnostic methods and therapy for intussusception are described.	1.111976172216764
Sonography is not only the diagnostic tool of choice in childs, but also led to the correct diagnosis in this case.	1.4650795999720805
In contrast to childhood intussusception, operative treatment is preferred in adults.	1.0371541654450454
The term "frontal lobe syndrome" comprises a variety of different clinical syndromes produced by focal lesions involving the prefrontal cortex.	0.9079395387451291
However, similar syndromes can be observed after lesions involving subcortical structures connected with the prefrontal cortex in neuronal networks.	1.1928595296842923
With respect to the different clinical pictures and underlying brain lesions, prefrontal lobe dysfunction may be divided into a disorganized type, caused by lesion of the dorsolateral prefrontal lobe and its connections, a disinhibited type that can be observed following lesions of the orbitofrontal cortex, and an apathetic type following lesions affecting the functional balance between the cingulum and the supplementary motor area.	1.0808325389106552
As intracerebral lesions are rarely limited to the brain regions described, in the majority of patients various degrees of behavioural dysfunction can be observed.	1.1279767635704736
The case reports of four patients illustrating the three major prefrontal syndroms following severe head injury (n=2) or cerebrovascular disease (n=2) are presented and diagnostic implications as well as possible treatment strategies are discussed.	1.2220382778333778
The measures taken in intensive care medicine are rated differently by the patients, their family, and personnel.	1.092545537497095
A lack of understanding for intensive care therapy can lead to a negative attitude towards intensive care medicine, which in turn makes an impression on public opinion, and disturbs the reputation of the co-workers in intensive care medicine.	1.0747006995242987
To form an objective view, we carried out a survey of 40 co-workers (11 physicians, 23 from the nursing staff, and 6 ancillary personnel) regarding the medical technology, the environment in the unit, general medical questions, and the extent of intensive care therapy.	1.296490973728319
The length of employment in the intensive care unit ranged from 1-240 months (median 18 months), the ages ranged from 21 to 53 years (median 30 years).	1.1663893768089193
Of those questioned 73%  found intensive care medicine in its current form to be purposeful: 100% of the physicians and only 57% of the nursing staff were of this opinion.	1.2967014335349993
Only 9% of the physicians believed the equipment to be fear-inducing for the patients; in contrast, 61% of the nursing staff believed this to be true.	1.3009148260982006
The noise level was rated as very disturbing by 65% of the nursing staff and 45% of the physicians.	1.1138811200649912
Only 22% of the nursing staff believed that the patients felt comfortable and protected on the intensive care unit; 48% felt that they were unhappy or even miserable.	1.0219555805058902
Of the physicians 46% believed that the patients were comfortable.	1.1352736024279295
Of the nursing staff 100% were of the opinion that for the deceased patients, organ substitution therapy had continued too long.	1.1085337662064565
On the other hand, only 45% of the residents shared this opinion.	1.1361922562279045
The medical staff rated the intensive care measures as purposeful, less disturbing for the patients and more effective than did the nursing staff.	1.1974711017284365
In many cases, the nursing staff as a group exhibited a contrary and negative opinion.	1.0889778806172712
This could possibly be caused by insecurity, lack of information and lack of successful experiences.	0.9394113045582196
Next to patient outcome, the competent explanation and information regarding the disease and prognosis and the recurrent communication within the intensive care team, with respect to diagnostic and therapeutic measures are the deciding factors in the opinion formation regarding intensive care medicine.	1.141974943336997
In this pilot study 12 patients with moderate to severe atopic eczema were treated with 2 million IU interferon alpha 2a (Roferon A) three times weekly for 8 weeks and followed up for a further 10 weeks: 2 patients showed clear and 9 a slight to moderate reduction of their skin lesions; 1 patient got worse.	1.1799092197166072
Pruritus did not decrease and even increased in a few patients, and IgE levels showed no change during and after treatment.	1.1678991361280058
All patients noted mild, transient, flu-like symptoms.	0.7625599467561069
The efficacy of interferon alpha in the present therapeutic design for the treatment of atopic eczema must thus be classified as only moderate.	1.074701863057344
Shock secondary to sepsis is a serious common disease with a substantial mortality.	0.9991473226667332
Coagulation abnormalities, ranging from a rapid fulminant state of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) to a slight elevation in the level of fibrin(ogen) degradation products, are well recognized in patients with bacterial septicemia.	1.047075364642954
Therefore, the inhibition of the activated coagulation is one of the first therapeutic steps.	1.1391330463160965
We investigated 30 intensive care patients with septic disease and comparable signs of abnomalities in coagulation at the beginning.	0.9762227049650724
Fifteen patients were treated with 1.5-5 E/kg body weight (Low dose group), the others received 8-15 E/kg (high dose group).	1.2327836640083323
Our study demonstrated a significant stronger and faster decline of coagulation parameters - such as d-dimer, TAT and PTF 1 + 2 - in the High dose group without any bleeding disorder.	1.2434508857184159
Thus, we support in cases of coagulation disease except fulminant ones the high dose therapy with LMWH as shown above.	1.185752780008739
Background: Laparoscopic techniques are currently used for curative resection of colorectal cancer although long-term results from controlled clinical trials are not available yet that prove laparoscopic procedures are adequate.	1.3384938992560322
Methods: All patients who underwent a curative resection of a colorectal tumor from 1995 to 1997 were included in a prospective cohort study to evaluate the short- and long-term results.	1.32235326471959
Results: Laparoscopic colorectal resections were accomplished in 68 patients.	1.0588103449881225
In only 3 patients was an adenoma (stage 0) found, and 10 patients had multiple liver metastases at the time of palliative resection.	1.2499611316689716
An oncological resection was performed in 55 patients.	0.8230499762473776
The average age was 62.8  +/-  14.6 years (29 female and 26 male patients).	1.079891558475678
Eleven right colectomies, 1 left colectomy, 21 sigmoid resections, 16 proctosigmoidectomies and 6 abdominoperineal resections were carried out.	1.0064702291546883
Two patients (3.6 %) were lost during follow-up.	1.1294047082570569
The median follow-up was 27.1 months (range 9.1-45.1 months).	1.4060408585175643
No port-site metastases were found.	0.592903129918265
Two patients who are still alive after sigmoid resection suffered from a recurrence.	1.0873769208883144
The first patient underwent only limited lymphadenectomy because of synchronous malignant lymphoma.	0.8256928181452039
The second patient developed bilateral lung metastases.	0.7756363163937003
Only one patient died during the follow-up period because of myocardial infarction.	1.1487117838793777
Conclusion: Although the follow-up is short, it seems that the recurrence rate is low.	1.4172387903353378
Controlled multicenter clinical trials are currently performed to evaluate whether laparoscopic surgery is really adequate to treat colorectal cancer.	1.1161593283358195
The authors report a tracheal rupture in a 34-year-old patient who was primarily intubated following generalised seizures and loss of consciousness (Rüsch endotracheal tube).	0.9455440244867854
Some hours later, she developed high ventilatory airway pressures and subcutaneous and mediastinal emphysema were noted.	0.9291524592618069
Reintubation with a high-volume, low-pressure endotracheal tube was planned when it was noted that the ballon of the Rüsch tube was grossly overinflated.	1.1072270605833958
Endotracheal tube cuff pressure was measured and found to be greater than 120 cm H2O (the maximum measurement possible with the manometer).	1.1365710494183603
The diagnosis of tracheal rupture was confirmed by fiberoptic bronchoscopy.	0.8525773785056063
The patient immediately underwent a throacotomy and a 3-cm tear of the pars membranacea of the trachea was sutured with a dural patch.	1.016132013223761
To maintain low airway pressures post-operatively, she remained sedated for 2 days and received a muscle relaxant to permit pressure-controlled ventilation.	1.0532689541752631
In this case, it can be concluded that excessive inflation of the endotracheal tube cuff resulted in the tracheal rupture.	1.0472187791269645
Other possible causes and results of tracheal rupture are discussed.	0.8352265543890728
Urinary tract infections are the most frequent nosocomial infections, accounting for about 40% of all nosocomial infections.	1.238139276631097
In most cases these infections are associated with indwelling urinary catheters.	0.8637842682779717
The guideline from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, USA) for the prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections, as the most important evidence-based guideline worldwide, was published in 1981 and has not been updated so far.	1.0453817474599603
Evidence-based national guidelines are not available in Germany.	0.8416443261356374
We have, therefore, performed a literature search for randomized, controlled studies on the prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (Medline, Cochrane Library, reference text books) published since 1981.	0.9852693637619598
Fifty studies meeting our inclusion criteria were identified.	0.6474319960917801
Substantial new findings have been published on alternatives to urethral catheters and new catheter materials.	0.9230320369072408
Based upon the CDC guideline, whose principles are still valid, updated guidelines for the prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections have been developed by the National Reference Center for Hospital Hygiene.	0.9654214002253293
Chronic hypoperfusion of the hypogastric arteries due to aortoiliac surgery leads to a complex of symptoms well known as Lerich's syndome.	0.9100026569271751
In contrast, acute ischemia of the pelvic arterial tree leads to lethal complications [2, 4, 5, 9, 10, 12, 13].	1.163781271676206
Acute interruption of the hypogastric perfusion mainly occurs after aortoiliac surgery or after selective transcatheter embolisation of the internal iliac artery for control of pelvic bleeding [1, 8].	1.0154629694631556
Several complications may occur after total occlusion: urinary bladder necrosis [6], left colon ischemia, spinal cord ischemia [10], nerve palsy, necrosis of the rectum and gluteal musculature [2, 11-13].	1.1846680821063384
Despite adequate therapy, mortality is over 70% [2].	1.1824195562521043
We report the case of a 66-year-old patient who survived after acute occlusion of the iliac arteries with gluteal necrosis following replacement of the infrarenal aorta with an aortobiiliacal graft.	0.9525277376420039
As demonstrated in 44 allogeneic sibling (34 HLA identical, 10 HLA mismatched at 1-3 loci) and 6 unrelated (1 HLA-identical, 5 mismatched at 1-3 loci) cord blood (CB) transplantations CB has been shown to be a rich source of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.	1.1378983463908052
Therefore, a scientific pilot project in order to evaluate HLA class I and II typed cord blood samples for unrelated transplantation was initiated.	1.1412054900634507
Hitherto 372 CB samples: mean volume 79 +/-  5x108, were collected from the umbilical cord vein immediately after vaginal full term delivery (n=302) or ceasarean section (n=70) and stored frozen in liquid nitrogen.	1.0682165237351537
Methods for HLA-typing by serology for HLA-class I and II from minimal cell amounts were adjusted that only 1.5 ml of the whole CB was needed for both the HLA-class I and II typing by serology (1 ml) and DNA-typing for HLA-class II (0.5 ml).	1.15676119887838
Only 3.5 additional ml of the CB were required for the AB0 typing, control of sterility, determination of progenitor cells by colony forming assays and CD34 and the analysis of contaminating maternal cells by simultaneous immunophenotypic and genotypic analysis of interphase cells and the PCR using sequence-specific priming (PCR-SSP) for the non-inherited maternal allel.	1.0027443836596395
Mother'sera have been tested for HBsAg, anti-HCV, -HAV, -HIV-1-2, -EBV, -VCA, -HTLVI-II, -CMV, Toxoplasmosis and Syphilis.	1.4764116824196876
Nonepithelial malignant tumors of the pancreas are extremely rare neoplasms with a frequency of ~0,6%.	1.0023690978036923
They are always explored because of a suspected diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma.	1.018505330147066
Amongst the more than 600 primary pancreatic neoplasms in our pancreatic tumor archive only 5 neoplasms were of nonepithelial origin (one was a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor [MPNST], one a leiomyosarcoma, one a malignant mesothelioma, and two were peripheral neuroectodermal tumors [PNET].	1.1983177011270567
The differential diagnosis includes secondary infiltration of the pancreas by mesenchymal tumors of the retroperitoneum, undifferentiated pancreatic carcinoma and, especially in the case of PNET, malignant lymphoma.	1.1965915323255403
Preoperative chemotherapy and down-staging can improve the operability and  prognosis, especially in PNET.	1.0834988698143082
In patients with renal or hepatic failure, the pharmacokinetics of opioids may be affected in several ways, leading to the necessity to correct the dose.	1.1357976749828795
The liver is the major site for biotransformation of most opioids.	0.9471250553681566
The major metabolic pathway is oxidation.	0.5718149568011948
Exceptions to this are morphine and buprenorphine, which undergo primarily glucuronidation, and remifentanil which is cleared by esther hydrolysis.	1.0699318342851352
The hydrophilic metabolites are predominantly excreted by the kidneys and may accumulate in patients with renal insufficiency.	0.9184988933795384
Some metabolites such as morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) or normeperidine are active opioid agonists.	0.953862540587278
With high concentrations they may cause narcotic effects or respiratory depression.	0.8028061518808034
In addition, special risks are known for normepridine that has been shown to exert neurotoxic effects with the risk of seizures.	1.1142700735979039
Few cases of respiratory depression following the administration of codeine, dihydrocodeine and tramdol have been reported.	0.8691538532913681
The elimination half-life of these drugs was prolonged.	1.0153927655505977
Lastly, the disposition of methadone, buprenorphine, fentanyl, sufentanyl and remifentanil appears to be unaffected in renal failure.	0.920127213531219
Backgrounds: Aim of this study was to validate a modification of adults' 13C-urea breath test for children in diagnosis of an infection with Helicobacter pylori.	0.9493001242707828
Methods: In 30 asymptomatic children results of the breath test were compared with results of an ELISA test specific for Helicobacter pylori.	1.1812881142464828
In 10 symptomatic children the breath test result was compared with histological results of gastric mucosa.	0.9885009819108018
Cold orange juice was tested by ultrasonic assessment to be suitable as a test meal.	0.9865626387222812
Results: With the serological or histological result as reference method, the cut-off value for children (delta value = 5 permil) has shown a sensitivity/specificity of 70 %/95 % or 100 %/100 % respectively.	1.409896439121425
Cold orange juice meets the criteria of a test meal by inhibiting the gastric emptying for the duration of the breath test significantly.	0.9675748699195936
30 minutes after 13C-urea ingestion has been the optimal point of time for the second breath sample collection.	0.9829925704552526
Conclusion: Our modification of the 13C-urea breath test for children is suitable to prove an Helicobacter pylori infection.	0.9652469810862795
This review summarizes some aspects of German pediatrics as it developed after world war II.	0.9180988498162738
Having lost its touch with international pediatrics regained its high standard during the late forties and fifties and now develops in concordance with the changing needs and the advances of pediatrics in a highly industialoized nation.	0.8728115818373207
As in other countries, the practice and structure of pediatrics have been influenced by changes in social attidudes and expectations, and by economic restrictions.	1.0449923912973875
National specifics are the high number of practicing pediatric population and emphasis on a highly structured and formalized preventive care program under a public health plan.	0.8950615718737909
The need for critical evaluation of this program is emphasized as is the need for better communication among subspecialties.	0.8922779520165884
Aim of this study was to isolate T lymphocytes from atheromatous plaques and to determine they respond to Chlamydia antigens.	0.9432157216674927
In recent years, mumps orchitis has become a rarely reported disease.	0.8875680734378556
However, since October 1994 a clear increase in the incidence of this disease has been observed.	1.3861257666015694
At four hospitals in the Saarland, Germany, 45 cases of mumps orchitis in adolescents and adults were diagnosed in this period.	0.9746869909812769
In addition to the case history and clinical findings, the diagnosis was confirmed by an increased IgM titer.	1.254942025720178
None of the patients had been previously vaccinated.	1.406276377634703
The main reason for this was a lack of parental knowledge of the necessity for this vaccination, one which has almost no side effects.	1.0718332688023824
The goal of this study is to describe the disease, present our own results, and indicate the need for vaccination.	1.117306922897214
In addition to providing information, a further aim of the study is to increase the motivation of adolescents and adults for vaccination.	1.2395194050793534
Although many treatments for mumps have been published in recent years, the most successful therapy is still prophylactic vaccination.	1.1426456485555283
Neurofibromas, café au lait macules and freckles in the axillary or inguinal regions are common manifestations of von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis (NF-1).	0.8241650035141642
Less known is the simultaneous appearance of dermal melanocytic naevi.	0.7852319868139187
We describe the case of a 21-year-old Vietnamese woman who showed generalized, multiple neurofibromas, a solitary plexiform neurofibroma in the left gluteal region and Lisch nodules.	1.1828708496965468
In addition, there were several large grey-blue macules histologically characterized by fusiform pigment-bearing cells in the dermis, which we diagnosed as persistent aberrant mongolian spots.	1.0918194798465775
In the right zygomatic region she presented a grey-blue, hair-bearing macule, which we saw as a variant of Ota's naevus.	1.0901448572189874
A genetic background for this coincidence of a systemic with a local phakomatosis can be supposed, as both Schwann's cells and melanocytes are derived from the neural crest.	1.016351889973928
Such pathologic rearrangement in the embryogenesis of the cellular elements could be important for the pathogenesis of NF-1 and dermal melanocytic nevi.	1.0405325767481484
Infectious agents may directly or indirectly (through the response of the host's immune system) modulate the growth of vascular cells.	0.8806070275590284
Local and/or systemic increase of cytokines could influence the extent of (re-)stenosis in the vascular tree.	1.1777073158970761
Further studies in this field may identify patients at a high risk for atherogenesis and restenosis.	1.1259682748247515
Their results should be helpful in treating restenosis after percutaneous coronary interventions.	0.7931659618469344
Besides other reasons, cost containments mandate the rational use of preoperative screening tests which should be adapted to the risk of the individual patient.	0.9935694282236882
Since the perioperative cardiac risk increases with age, elderly patients in particular require a thorough evaluation of their perioperative risk.	0.9854804597349482
Routine ECG, however, is not indicated in patients under 45 years of age who do not present with signs or history of preexisting cardiac diseases but should be performed on a routine basis in all patients over 45 years of age.	1.1394938451577774
The validity of an ergometer test as a preoperative indicator of myocardial ischemia is limited due to a high incidence of false negative results.	1.0114688833859542
By preoperative routine chest radiography previously unknown findings are only detected in a small number of patients; thus, in patients of ASA-risk groups I-II younger than 74 years of age routine chest-x-ray cannot be justified.	1.2359024736288542
In patients whose perioperative cardiac risk as assessed clinically and by ECG is ambiguous, dipyridamole-thallium-myocardial scintigraphy (DTMS) and dobutamine-stress-echocardiography may contribute valuable information regarding the prediction of perioperative adverse cardiac events.	0.9734457776220372
In that respect, dobutamine-stress-echocardiography appears to be superior to DTMS.	0.8066092227738553
The laboratory tests required in patients of different ASA-risk groups and according to their age are presented in an overview.	1.0197029780281082
Generalized muscle weakness in critically ill patients can result in prolonged periods of artificial ventilation and longer stays in the intensive care unit.	0.8225203554066951
Both neuropathic (critical illness polyneuropathy) and myopathic (critical illness myopathy) abnormalities seem to play an important role for this prolonged weakness.	1.0318495404917758
This article reviews its complex differential diagnosis with special emphasis on the current understanding of the neuromuscular syndromes.	1.1394721798204883
An efficient diagnostic plan is necessary for the exclusion of other curable causes of prolonged muscle weakness even in the presence of polyneuromyopathic changes.	0.9195495520620388
Psychological support of the patient and prophylaxis of secondary complications of prolonged immobilization are crucial when specific therapy is not possible.	1.1102452434321743
Modern ultrasonic diagnostic instruments with high resolution and color Doppler sonography allow the obstetrician to describe pathological findings very precisely and at an early stage of pregnancy.	0.9033618687957344
The use of high-resolution ultrasound makes it possible to detect heart malformations already between the 8th and 10th week of gestation.	0.9194674076432668
This development has essentially changed the clinical requirements on fetal autopsy which in its traditional way no longer meets the increased demands.	0.8842936995544338
Unless the pathologists faces this challenge the importance of fetal autopsy will diminish.	0.7876513252942348
Modern image databases and communication techniques allow the pathologist to have direct access to text and images of pre-findings by other clinics.	0.8355361705793253
Great importance, however, must be attached to the interdisciplinary cooperation with obstetricians and geneticists.	0.9603471688515495
We report on routine fetal autopsy by using an interdisciplinary database an the Charité.	1.1324512051568654
Infrainguinal arterial reconstruction for intermittent claudication has been discouraged because of fear of bypass graft failure, significant perioperative complications, and limb loss.	0.9973090523312129
This may be worse than the natural history of the disease.	0.8021913522020737
In our study, we retrospectively evaluated all infrainguinal bypass procedures performed in the past 10 years.	1.1310194507209461
Radiosurgery represents a minimally invasive radiologic method for the treatment of intracranial tumours and arteriovenous malformations.	0.9244066672168649
In 1994 the radiosurgical device 'Leksell Gamma Knife' (LGK) was installed in a dedicated logistic environment for outpatient treatments.	0.8875835113057865
High quality requirements have to be met for radiosurgery.	0.8298215913181417
The target point accuracy taking into account the whole system was shown to be reliably below 0.5 mm whereas the spatial therapeutic resolution was 0.035 cm3.	1.1322961348077039
Quality parameters of the dose plan were evaluated for the first 500 consecutive treatments.	1.171127188338741
These values and examples of dose plans were used to emphasize the advantages of the treatment principle with multiple isocenters.	1.1001433463439256
An analysis of data in the literature revealed that there is no uniform standard of treatment available in radiosurgery.	1.2733292757179586
A highly significant correlation between a risk prediction model for the stereotactic linear accelerator on the one hand and a different model for the LGK on the other could be shown.	1.1287890145017534
This result could be helpful in order to proceed towards a more uniform treatment standard in radiosurgery and to improve overall treatment results.	0.9817373742868822
Even if Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis has not found the true aetiology of puerperal fever - bacteria were identified as pathogens only after his observations - he was the first to consequently use epidemiological methods in order to elucidate connections and influencing factors in the spread of nosocomial infections, to draw the right conclusions from his observations on the transmission of childbed fever and to draw the right consequences by implementing preventive measures, especially the hand disinfection.	1.1003084919778499
He has correctly realized that human beings suffering from purulent or putride lesions or having even died from them can act as infectious sources as can hands of health-care personnel act as vehicles.	0.855296268001082
As a characteristic feature of nosocomial infection, he noticed that generally only the weakend organism of the patient is involved as an infection target.	1.1977600723518396
The impact of his doctrine not only made him "saviour of the mothers" but also justifies to regard him as "father of the obstetric infection prevention" if not even as the founder of the modern science-based hospital hygiene.	1.0459087869664574
In this paper we present a method for measuring the wear of the polyethylene inlay in knee joint endoprostheses from standard X-ray images.	1.1740771414792077
Our approach is to estimate the spatial position of the tibial and femoral components of the prostheses from their contours in the X-ray image.	1.084251634974073
When we know the exact shape of these two components, we can calculate the minimal spatial distance between them which approximates the remaining thickness of the inlay.	1.1243499996528912
First results show that this approach might provide sufficient accuracy for the given task.	0.9972517359389974
Most children with borreliosis show cutaneous symptoms following a tick bite infected with Borrelia Burgdorferi.	0.7487456076448614
Erythema migrans is a classical skin lesion of early borreliosis characterized by a centrifugally expanding erythema at the site of the prior tick bite.	0.9055999018506904
After hematological spreading of the vector multiple erythemata migrantia occur with a very low incidence in Europe as described in the case of a 2 1/2 years old infant who was successfully treated with oral cephalosporine.	1.0728726718524026
One year follow-up revealed no further manifestations of borreliosis.	0.9018773672046813
This means an excellent prognosis for those children with borreliosis who are treated promptly.	0.9432023426478501
Background: We compared the standard suprathreshhold strategy to the so-called threshhold splitting strategy with 5 and 2 dB steps.	1.094359492957764
The aim of the study was to establish whether the threshhold splitting strategy had advantages over the suprathreshhold strategy that has been used to date.	1.0213947102576553
Resection specimens of 14 patients with small cell bronchial carcinoma after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were processed histologically and graded according to a three-step regression grading system: grade I, no or only slight tumor regression; grade II, incomplete tumor regression; grade III, complete tumor regression without vital tumor tissue.	1.071840648376299
In five patients with either no vital tumor tissue or only small tumor remnants in the resection samples, a typical sequence of central fresh tumor necrosis, foam cell rim, vascular granulation tissue and peripheral scar formation was seen.	1.082510651487024
This morphological finding may be interpreted as a characteristic, but unspecific parameter of good response to preoperative chemotherapy.	0.9580867239827435
The presence of vital tumor rims surrounding the capillary bed with intermingled necrotic foci, however, argues in favor of spontaneous tumor regression, which is commonly observed in small cell lung cancer.	1.1503821172571762
Background: The term "Castleman's diseas" (angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia) comprises a heterogeneous clinicopathologic entity among lymphoproliferative disorders.	0.9919549185908291
In accordance with the German law on care for helpless persons, an observer rating scale has been developed to allow a staging of need of care.	1.1329042783438312
Construction of the scale, item descriptions, definitions, algorithms for sum score and inter-rater reliability data are reported.	0.8227475872416437
The scale can reliably measure the need of care, quality of care, and who is the care provider.	1.066940617830673
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) improves the success of trabeculectomy.	0.8391727794952378
Since in vitro studies showed a prolonged effect of 36 days of growth inhibition with a single dose of 5-FU, 5-FU is applied intraoperatively.	1.2229209997324688
To evaluate the effect of intraoperatively applied 5-FU, we compared 13 (low-risk) patients with intraoperative application of 5-FU to a control group matched by age, diagnosis, sex and stage of glaucoma.	1.2801206710687707
Postoperatively on day 4 the IOP was significant lower (4.8 mmHg) in the 5-FU-group in comparison to the untreated group (P=0.005; power 0.80).	1.2696704844296258
After 1 week the difference decreased to 2 mmHg and was not significant any more (P=0.16).	1.1260671363168997
After 1 week a lower mean intraocular pressure of 2 mmHg was found with a P-value of 0.16.	1.0301796726456658
It may be that these results are not just due to an antiproliferative mechanism; a direct toxic effect of 5-FU should be considered.	1.1831574694740092
5-FU side effects such as corneal complications and inflammatory reaction were not increased in the 5-FU group.	1.0050743888644502
However, one case of persistent hypotony was seen in the 5-FU group.	1.4271097823678345
This study found intraoperative use of 5-FU to be a safe procedure with a pronounced capacity to lower IOP in the direct postoperative phase.	1.1770983778278439
However, this effect may not be based on an antiproliferative effect alone, but might be of toxic origin.	1.3849764765064463
A postoperative bile fistula is a rare but severe complication after biliary surgery.	0.906825773113809
Clinical signs, laboratory findings, ultrasound and ERC lead to diagnosis.	0.8553355866892488
We report on 40 cases with postoperative bile leakage after cholecystectomy treated by a nasobiliary tube.	1.174995689158498
In all patients the fistula healed within 7 days after placement of the tube.	0.9906793945056268
Two patients needed operative treatment of a subhepatic abscess, and in 2 patients drainage of a bilioma was performed.	1.2785903955126476
In 2 cases with biliary peritonitis, a step-by-step lavage was necessary.	1.0059577443305912
The nasobiliary tube for postoperative bile fistula offers regular radiological control and reduces the necessity of operative reintervention in the biliary tract.	0.908642894814039
Description of a 27 years old patient with chronic renal failure due to diabetes, which requires dialysis, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism, who developed fulminant systemic calciphylaxis after successful renal transplantation.	1.2065091175939244
Characteristic of this syndrome, there occured soft tissue calcification, mediacalcinosis of the small and medium-sized arteries and ischemic skin necrosis.	1.1478036861743763
The pathogenesis is not completely clear, but challenging agents like corticosteroids or immunsuppressants, in a sensitized organism (at hypercalcemia or elevated parathormon) could lead to calcium deposits.	1.2261090271264075
These are showing a particular affinity for elastic tissue.	0.7026353659340792
Lungs, stomach, kidneys, cutis, heart and vascular system are most frequently involved.	0.9892755467836193
Treatment is primarily supportive; an early parathyroidectomy seems to have the best prognosis.	1.033054365841247
Contact urticaria and anaphylactic reactions to latex-containing rubber products are being recognized with increasing frequency in all kinds of medical disciplines.	0.9270499952797717
Recently a number of reports have been published describing anaphylactic reactions to food items in patients with latex allergy.	1.0486706106180017
The cases of three patients who developed anaphylactic reactions to both latex and food items are presented, and the importance of the association of latex and cross-reactivity with food items is stressed.	1.188495314875641
The food items that led to anaphylactic reactions were banana and avocado; banana, avocado and buckwheat; and banana, avocado and tomato.	0.794977558303149
The cross-reactivity of latex to buckwheat and tomato has not been reported before.	0.8786507811564734
The branchio-oto-renal syndrome (BOR syndrome) is characterized by auricular abnormalities, lateral cervical fistulas and preauricular tags.	0.8875647676823704
The hearing impairment may be a conductive, a sensorineural or a mixed hearing loss.	1.0570428204999955
The renal disease is oligomeganephronia, a bilateral, congenital renal abnormality with reduced numbers of nephrons.	1.0144731785327596
The BOR syndrome is an autosomal-dominant disease.	0.922268536251883

The available literature on the psychosocial aspects of head and neck cancer surgery from 1950 to 1995 was reviewed in four parts.	0.553546903206707
The CO2 laser myringotomy is a current low-pain procedure for middle-ear ventilation for secretory otitis media (SOM) that can be performed under topical anesthesia, even in children.	1.0554374076694422
The duration of middle-ear ventilation is essentially determined by the size of the perforation created.	1.0147391363395422
Perforations with a diameter greater than 2 mm ventilate the tympanic cavity for approximately 3 weeks, thus avoiding tympanic ventilation tubes.	0.9637394821948638
To date, the CO2 laser beam can only be reliably applied to the tympanic membrane via a micromanipulator system coupled to an ear microscope.	0.9544222818907917
The CO2 laser otoscope is a new application system that markedly reduces the technical complexity of surgery and improves the mobility and availability of the system.	1.0790333216574093
The incorporation of a small inexpen-sive CO2 laser in the otoscope represents a significant development in SOM therapy.	0.8873034683096516
Abstract   Amifostine is an organic thiophsophate which protecvts normal cells from the effects of chemotherapy with reduced nadir and duration of cyclophosphmamid induced neutropenia, reduced cisplatin derived renal and neurological complications being described.	0.9753712223360766
However, no data are available for urological malignancies treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy.	1.1490255438633046
Aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of pretreatment with amifostine in terms of prevention of renal, hematopoetic and neurologic toxicity.	0.8983532502050741
17 patients (mean age: 62.6 [45-74]) with advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder received inductive or adjuvant cisplatin based chemotherapy (1-6 cycles) with a cisplatin dose of 70 mg/m2.	1.2657688200197443
Amifostine (740-910 mg/m2) was administered intravenously 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy.	0.9478503242012717
For all patients creatinine clearance, serum creatinine and electrolytes including magnesium, and blood cell count were determined prior to and after each cycle.	1.1304058322824384
A group of 12 patients (mean age: 61.9 [51-67]) did undergo MVEC chemotherapy (1-4 cycles) without receiving amifostine and served as control group.	1.2602719557501336
Amifostine was well tolerated and only 1 patient suffered from gastrointestinal discomfort, blood pressure remained unchanged in all patients.	1.0745673067640398
Amifostine prevented a significant reduction of creatinine clearance even in the 2 patients with known renal insufficiency: mean creatinine clearance was 125  +/-  20 ml/min prior to and 115  +/-  25 ml/min after chemotherapy.	1.148286228648082
In the control group, however, creatinine clearance dropped from 121  +/-  30 ml/min to 85  +/-  20 ml/min after completion of MVEC chemotherapy.	1.0647464964930466
Serum creatinine levels did not increase significantly (1.1 mg/dl prior to and 1.2 mg/dl after chemotherapy), magnesium levels did not decrease significantly and normalized at the end of chemotherapy.	1.3409051740779425
Significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia developed in 29 % and 12 % of the patients in the amifostine group and in 67 % and 33 % of the patients in the control group.	1.3302595409974975
Amifostine was shown to have a protective effect against cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity in the elderly patient undergoing systemic chemotherapy.	1.0900744025888454
Based on our data amifostine should be applied in the supportive management to prevent chemotherapy induced complications.	0.9995797508300976
The diagnosis of leptomeningeal dissemination of chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL) by conventional cytology is unreliable because cytomorphologic criteria of malignancy are often lacking.	1.0214260058517273
Immunophenotyping of leukocyte differentiation antigens may also be of limited diagnostic value due to the small  number of cells in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples.	0.9387056156556687
Molecular methods may support the specific diagnosis of leptomeningeal infiltration of CLL.	0.9082406338583404
We present an 54 old patient who was diagnosed with CLL five years ago.	1.046558235062777
Despite clinical signs of leptomeningeal  involvement neither magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) nor conventional CSF analysis were suggestive of lymphomatous meningitis.	0.8352764718629317
Using PCR we selectively amplified the highly variable and clone-specific CDR3 region of the locus encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) in DNA obtained from both CSF and peripheral blood cells.	0.9654484963096253
Analysis of PCR products by high resolution gel electrophoresis revealed a single DNA fragment respectively indicating the presence of a  monoclonal cell population in both  compartments.	1.0029155094546645
DNA sequence analysis of the amplified CDR3 segments confirmed the clonal identity of cells and the leptomeningeal dissemination of CLL.	0.8615956639194422
In the orthopedic department of the University Hospital Homburg/Saar, we use since 1993 a computer-based system for clinics organisation and documentation of operations.	1.097721813972219
Hardware consists of DOS/Windows PC's in a Novell-network.	0.6920261999634183
Our software is a combination of datbase-system for managing patient-data and a special coding program for ICD and IKPM-digits.	0.9111913492706272
Our experience shows that computer assisted clinic-management is an effective tool to help the surgeon in planning and documentation.	0.9604321649188546
Until now, we used the system for 31 500 patients and 8500 operations.	1.1086129405801066
A flexible software can meet the requirements both of the surgeons and administration.	0.8579432237259572
Moreover, in the University hospital Homburg/Saar, the different departments are linked by an Intranet with connection to other scientific networks and the Internet.	1.1620480829564845
In one third of the little girls coming to the outpatient clinic for pediatric gynecology, a vulvovaginitis can be diagnosed.	1.0536042581741278
Etiologic factors are poor perineal hygiene, foreign bodies in the vagina and respiratory or skin infections.	0.9751257451092951
The microbiologic investigation often reveals staphylococci, streptococci, E. coli, and in case of chronical-recurrent discharge also B. fragilis and peptostreptococci.	1.1402168030007893
The symptoms are itching, burning, dysuria, discharge and rubor of the vulva.	0.9339490210123641
A systemic application of antibiotics is not necessary, a local treatment with antibiotic solutions is contraindicated and the usual vaginal suppositories are unsuitable for girls.	1.0666848075333797
A desinfection often irritates the vulvovaginal region of little girls so that for years we use estriol ointment only which is tolerated.	0.8282202060045323
Excellently, a single-dose application being sufficient; burning, itching and discharge disappear and the vaginal epithelium gets more resistant because of the estrogen influence, so that the healing process is accelerated.	1.046374416742402
The author gives a short overview of the psychodynamic and psychoanalytic basics of psychotherapy with guided affective imagery.	0.8983710174756768
The differences of the imaginations of neurotic patients and patients with severe personality disorders are demonstrated and discussed.	1.0430983680386265
Two clinical cases are described in detail which show the special elements of symbol formation on different levels of ego-structure.	0.9364968926838412
Then the most important results of the recent infant research and the research of attachment behaviour, especially those of the group of Fonagy, and their importance for the theory of symbol formation are discussed.	1.287751092615591
The theory of potential space is used as a base for understanding imaginative processes.	0.8753811802130927
General and special technical recommandations for the treatment of borderline cases with guided affective imagery are derived.	0.9040661927941479
Especially the relationship to the theories of Bion, Ogden and Winnicott is estimated.	0.7577668032137259
The situation of psychiatric patients in the Ukraine is determined by the financial and economic difficulties of this country.	1.0150315890782284
In the larger cities, so-called polyclinics take care of ambulant psychiatric patients.	0.8762459716160578
However, no other social psychiatric institutions exist.	1.2539299507194552
Here, the modalities of hospital psychiatric treatment are discussed using the psychiatric hospitals in Kiev and Shitomir as examples.	0.9767207229371951
Undertreatment is also a problem, because only a few psychopharmacological drugs are produced in the Ukraine.	1.151249914955235
Import of new psychopharmacological agents is hampered by economical problems.	0.7147794222126556
Improving the availability of psychopharmacological drugs and the establishment of a social psychiatric network are major aims for psychiatrists working in Ukraine.	0.7874775556055617
Renal lesions are frequently encountered in blunt pediatric abdominal trauma.	0.6742109933393102
In this retrospective study, we analyzed the incidence of renal trauma in these trauma patients to determine which diagnostic and therapeutic approaches were most predictive.	1.162114332229652
From 1976 to 1996, 308 children sustaining blunt abdominal trauma were admitted to our department.	0.7705678325024203
Patients were evaluated using abdominal paracentesis, ultrasonography, and urinary analysis.	1.0268799683825607
In specific cases, IV urography, CT scan, and/or angiography were applied.	1.0901719595027386
We used the Organ Injury Scale (OIS) for classification of renal trauma into five grades.	0.9713157175703018
The result of a B-scan ultrasound examination is strongly dependent on the type of the used B-system, the chosen system parameters and the experience and critical analysis of the clinical investigator.	1.0776988707537243
The estimation of quantitative acoustic parameters, independent of the type of the used B-system, is one way to overcome the subjective nature and the problems of the interpretation of B-scan images.	1.0803157443481832
Results of a longitudinal study about the transition to retirement are presented.	0.9537956421223602
329 persons were interviewed three times (quantitative study) and 20 persons conducted a semi-structured diary (qualitative study), covering in both groups a two-year period (from half a year before retirement to one and a half years after retirement).	1.1080251944420045
They were asked about their subjective well-being (happiness, joy, satisfaction, stresses), their life situation and their personal, social and material resources.	1.0841390171801895
The results show that the transition to retirement brings with it gains (leisure time) and losses (financial, social status), but overall maintains a high level of well-being.	1.1252365322420372
Specific analyses point out inter-individual differences, risk factors and resources, like a high level of trait well-being, health, social networks and an optimistic outlook.	1.0176328313392597
The diary analyses lead to specifications, more detailed process analyses and hypotheses about cohort effects.	0.9156632148057072
Consequences for an adequate preparation for retirement are discussed.	0.746245205600724
Intraoperative complications can be divided into three categories on the basis of the time of their occurrence: Group I - Problems associated with access; group II: introduction of the endovascular stent (a: release of the main segment, b: anchoring the second limb); and group III: incidence of primary endoleaks.	1.232722496847395
Interferon alpha and gamma have been used to treat several hepatic, hematological and oncological diseases for years.	0.9889306355817651
Recently, interferon beta has been introduced as a therapeutic agent in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.	1.1260837651475561
A 41-year-old female patient with multiple sclerosis developed non-tender, palm-sized, cutaneous-subcutaneous, reddish infiltrates at the injection sites on her thighs after 8 weeks of treatment with subcutaneous interferon beta injections.	0.9937139568251818
Histopathology revealed a perivascular lymphoid infiltrate of the dermis and a subtle lobular lymphoid infiltrate of the subcutis.	0.9294861378842983
Interferon beta therapy was discontinued for 4 weeks.	0.7295538601873314
With topical corticosteroids, the skin lesions resolved.	1.1441848417868505
When subcutaneous injections were resumed at a reduced dose, only erythema around injection sites developed without induration or pain.	0.916383925418288
Slight erythema and swelling at interferon beta injection site are frequent and rare cases of cutaneous necrosis have been described.	0.9279825663624826
However, no reports of large, painful, cutaneous-subcutaneous infiltrates after interferon beta therapy have been published.	1.0437203205003853
In adults, infectious spondylitis is a rare but severe disease, caused by a bacterial thrombus in tissue of reduced resistance.	1.073239407366636
In conventional radiographs initial findings are a narrowing of the intervertebral space, local osteoporosis and poorly defined erosive borders of the vertebral endplates.	1.0760934175684786
These changings can be found at least three to six weeks after the onset of disease.	1.0961501495908512
However, in Szintigraphy and MRT pathologic alterations are evident after ten to twelve days.	1.0489523067395474
Thus, early diagnosis and treatment becomes possible.	1.4808123059998743
In early stages of the disease a localized lysis surrounded by a reactive sclerosis appears in predisposed areas of the vertebral body (subchondral, anterobasal, ventral, central).	1.020022182228346
Apparently, a soft tissue tumor is associated.	1.0441919412811622
Sclerosis and reduction of the soft tissue tumor are the first signs of repair processes.	0.9199854078694266
After at least 12 weeks, computed tomography can reveal typical sintering of the vertebral body and occasionally the development of a bony sequester.	1.0955757037894656
In addition, MRT as well as CT can be helpful in the detection and localization of complications as abscesses or affection of the vertebral canal.	1.219817367034905
The tuberculous spondylitis can sometimes cause difficulties in differential diagnosis.	0.5433494087341605
Clinical findings, affection of several vertebral bodies, large soft tissue tumors with appearance of calcification as well as not typical locations are strongly suggestive of tuberculous spondylitis, but these findings are not specific of the disease.	1.0752555433588022
Degenerative disorders such as erosive osteochondrosis or changings due to chronic dialysis (e. g. amyloid or crystal arthropathies) may cause even more problems in differential diagnosis.	0.9592918927554931
Typical for a blastomatous process is the integrity of the interverebral disc space, which is a rare finding in spondylitis.	1.2119415212119669
To show the possibilities of imaging diagnostic procedures using high and extremely high resolution ultrasonic probes we investigated the anatomic structures of the foot.	1.008080487648241
We examinated 10 cadaver foots of the anatomic institute and in a clinical trial 20 healthy patients with 10 to 20-MHz-probes and could identify correctly single tendons and ligaments even in the toe region.	1.027586292349337
Especially the possibility of dynamic examination had to be mentioned beside the other advantages of ultrasound diagnostic (saving of expenses, lack of radiation, side-to-side comparison).	1.0323499822907174
An essential parameter for the incorporation of drugs and narcotics into head hair is the content of hair pigment (melanins).	0.8846963207917012
Toxicological studies of hair should therefore take the colour of the hair into consideration.	1.0330322267506455
As the available vocabulary for verbal characterisation is small and the description depends on the subjective opinion of the viewer, it was the purpose of this study to investigate if colorimetric measurements allow objectivation of hair colour.	1.1302497465500836
The natural hair colour of 17 subjects was described subjectively in words and by comparing it with a hair colour chart (Wella, Darmstadt, Germany).	0.9183287174212122
Subsequently the colours of the hair and the samples of the hair colour chart used for comparison were measured by colorimetric analysis and the CIEL*a*b* values were determined.	1.0650736823862503
The descriptive categorisation of the hair colours (e.g.	0.6951900171021074
blonde, brown, black) could often not be recognised in the colorimetric results.	1.0657214525902488
Sometimes considerable differences were also found between the colour values of the natural hair samples and the specimens used for comparison.	1.1768485483908422
When the colour measurements were repeated at intervals of several days the results were found to be reproducible.	1.157188309083168
We measured the ventilatory pattern and additional work of breathing (WOBadd) at three different levels of inspiratory pressure support [IPS 5, 10, 15 mbar above positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)] and in a new ventilatory mode, automatic tube compensation (ATC), in nine operative patients without lung injury nine patients ventilated for several following acute respiratory insufficiency (ARI).	1.142121764064464
In ATC, endotracheal tube resistance is compensated automatically by means of closed-loop control of the calculated tracheal pressure.	0.9632253368281553
Pressure support in this mode, i. e. airway pressure above PEEP, is equal to the actual flow-dependent pressure drop across the endotracheal tube (ETT).	1.0493694767906854
Airway pressure rises at the beginning of inspiration and falls towards the end.	0.8030986748278404
As the tube resistance of ETT seriously hinders expiration and can cause desynchronization between ventilator and patient, airway pressure is reduced below PEEP during expiration in the same way as it is increased during inspiration.	0.9785174782986155
The result is a near-constant tracheal pressure at PEEP both during inspiration and during expiration.	0.9081387388642145
This mode could be best termed as "electronic extubation".	0.7380320278601831
The most striking difference between the postoperative patients and the ARI patients was their minute ventilation (17.8+/-1.85 l/min in ARI patients vs 7.3+/-3.1 l/min in the postoperative patients).	1.3389214367339937
In the postoperative patients augmentation of IPS from 5 to 15 mbar induced a steady increase in tidal volume (VT) and a consecutive decrease in respiratory rate (rr) compared with ATC (VTATC,postop= 463+/-78 ml; rrATC,postop =16+/-4 min-1; VTIPS5,postop = 505+/-79 ml; rrIPS5,postop = 15+/-4 min-1; VTIPS10,postop = 562+/-86 ml; rrIPS15,postop =14+/-4 min-1; VTIPS15,postop=660+/- 151 ml; rrTPS15, postop = 12+/-4 min-1), whereas the augmentation of IPS of 5 and 10 mbar in the ARI patients could not compensate for the increase in rr and the decrease in VT, after switching from ATC to IPS (VTATC,ARI 724+/-308 ml, rrATC,ARI = 24+/-6 min-1; VTIPS5,ARI = 649+/-315 ml; rrIPS 5,ARI = 27+/-8 min-1; VTIPS10,ARI=653+/-353 ml; rrIPS10,ARI = 25+/-8 min-1: Even IPS 15 was not able to reestablish VT at the values observed during ATC (VTIPS15,ARI =680+/-312 ml).	1.1210106974339575
During ATC WOBadd was small in both postoperative and ARI patients (WOBadd,ATC,postop = 93+/-36 mJ/l, WOBadd,ATC,ARI =116 +/-72 mJ/l).	1.1037494295455044
In the postoperative patients, an inspiratory pressure support of 5 mbar was not sufficient to compensate WOBadd compared with ATC.	1.0949486174308631
However, IPS 10 and 15 mbar were able to compensate for WOBadd (WOBadd.ATC5,postop WOBadd,IPS5,postop =189+/-77 mJ/l; WOBadd,IPS10,postop = 55+/-30 mJ/l; WOBadd,IPS15,postop = 21+/-11 mJ/l).	1.1090100163648728
In the ARI patients an IPS 5, 10 or 15 mbar was not sufficient to compensate for WOBadd (WOBadd,IPS 5,ARI = 1126+/-262 mJ/l; WOBadd,IPS 10,ARI 863+/-253 mJ/l; WOBadd,IPS 15,ARI 763+/-298 mJ/l).	1.019090110212753
Under ATC, WOBadd was only 15% of WOBadd under IPS of 15 mbar.	1.1253232077892328
All but two patients were successfully extubated after the investigation.	1.0218918869782347
These two patients were not extubated because they were dependent on an FIO2 >0.5.	1.1324591993084798
Our results strongly indicate that ventilatory dependence in ARI patients may be caused by the ETT rather than by mechanical dysfunction of the lung.	0.9145462120429722
ATC is a very helpful mode to use in distinguishing between ventilatory failure caused by ETT and real ventilatory dependence.	1.0224674957392812
The preoperative localization of pharmaco-resistent focal epilepsies before surgery and the prognosis concerning seizure outcome are both of importance.	0.9775373296793095
In addition to conventional MRI diagnostics for the detection of small epileptogenic lesions, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (HMR spectroscopy) can be useful for assessing the bilaterality of pathological changes in cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsies.	1.0442241862139607
The technique and findings of HMR spectroscopy are reported in patients with cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsies.	0.8001909193442764
The findings indicate that chemical shift imaging (CSI) investigations of the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres provide important information for the prediction of seizure outcome after epilepsy surgery.	0.937253294218699
This paper describes the conceptual considerations in planning and realizing an inpatient unit for traumatized patients.	0.7127180261023045
The different concepts of the dynamic of the traumatic disease and the aetiopathology of posttraumatic stressdisease (PTSD) are highly significant in regard to the realisation of differing concepts of inpatient therapy of trauma.	1.1123042780158958
The utilisation of Konzentrative Bewegungstherapy (KBT) and Creative Therapy in our conflict- and solution-oriented analytic concept permits us to neglect a fictitious contradiction between traumaexposure and traumalimitation and a "potential space" (Winnicott) can be opened to the creative work with the patients.	1.0208144844624392
This paper illustrates with some casuistic examples the utilisation of KBT in transforming the traumatic body-flashbacks into narrative memory-scripts, by the use of symbolizing processes.	0.9094344419061522
In 55 consecutive patients with the same dual chamber pacemaker (Relay, Intermedics) and different pacing leads, the influence of different safety margins for pacing on battery current was investigated.	1.1259575937533157
2.8 +/- 0.9 years after implantation, atrial and ventricular pulse-width thresholds (tRS) (ms) were determined at 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 V, and the charge delivered at threshold was telemetered.	1.300426969463458
If tRS was <1.50 ms at 0.5 V, an amplitude of 1.0 V was programmed in the atrium and the ventricule; if tRS was <1.50 ms at 1.0 V, then an amplitude of 2.0 V was chosen.	1.0416414773197287
Two times the charge threshold (2x QRS), two times the voltage threshold (2x URS), and three times the pulse-width threshold (3x tRS) were programmed as the safety margins for pacing.	1.2195633703879425
With every safety margin, battery current (IRS) (µA) was averaged from 5 telemetric readings in D00 mode with 70 bpm.	0.9959247554186776
IBat was significantly lower with 2x QRS as compared with 2x URS (13.43 +/- 1.0 vs. 14.20 +/- 1.2 µA, p<0.01) and as compared with 3x tRS (13.99 +/- 1.2 µA, p<0.05).	0.9549437697634726
Pacemaker longevity derived from these current data was significantly longer with 2x QRS (112 +/- 8 months) as compared with 2x URS (106 +/- 9, p<0.01) and as compared with 3x tRS (108 +/- 8, p<0.05).	1.0197739855115437
If current consumption is compared intraindividually in dependance on the programmed amplitude, battery current is significantly lower at 1.0 V as compared with 2.0 V resulting in a mean reduction of 0.63 µA (-4.9%, p<0.05) and an average gain in longevity of 5 months.	1.2568946623076829
This applies to every safety margin tested.	0.6108739947831213
Differences in battery current caused by the safety margins will translate into a greater gain in longevity in future pacemaker models with reduced internal current consumption.	0.8908218762273087
Any medical procedure must be legally authorized by the patient, giving informed consent.	0.9163634711673403
This prerequisite is based on the right to self determination.	1.1147175693306084
Otherwise a medical procedure is considered as physical injury.	0.9982761714490713
Thus, the way, how a specific procedure is performed, predominantly depends on the patient's will.	1.28387055391903
The attending physician's duty is to find out this will, which is especially important when old patients and patients incapable of giving valid consent are involved.	1.1630143550381828
Before the procedure the physician has to have a confidential talk with the patient.	1.0441382121661376
He has to point out the best treatment possible considering the individual circumstances of the patient's life.	1.0528950114061955
The physician has to find out, weather the patient is competent to refuse or consent to treatement.	1.029153646842603
Furthermore the consultation is an opportunity to diminish the patient's fear and to increase his confidence.	0.9778102558111361
The main problem treating old patients is that they often lack the mental ability for appreciation of the nature of the situation.	1.0571585017693894
One has to differentiate between the physiological mental decay and dementia or psychiatric diseases.	0.8746494904916787
In these cases a third party consent is necessary.	0.9126648048407825
This review of German neurology during the Nazi era mentions first the significance of Jewish neurologists for the history of the specialty, and the irreplaceable loss that their expulsion from Germany represented.	1.0790728302656487
A brief discussion of the scientific accomplishments of German neurologists during this time is followed by a description of violations of ethical principles, exemplified by the human experiments of G. Schaltenbrand.	1.0669510344522342
The spirit of the age exerted a malevelent influence.	0.7567410269177043
A postal survey targeted at 1000 firms in the metal- and electronic working industry of Northrhine Westfalia was carried out by Sozialforschungsstelle Dortmund und Institute of geronotology to analyze the implementation of the collective agreement concerning partial retirement.	0.9036574095044092
As the results show, firms in Northrhine Westfalia are willing to accept the collective agreement and use partial retirement though there are still problems left to solve.	1.0023193300600144
Firms are further using partial retirement as an instrument of early retirement.	0.9169203590774655
Therefore partial retirement is created as a so-called "blocked model".	0.6957434160552054
From February 1991 to May 1998, 340 patients had a cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) implanted.	0.9217234699542591
Mean age was 64  +/-  9 years, 278 male and 62 female.	1.0059914441062747
60% of patients had coronary artery disease and 31% dilative cardiomyopathy.	1.2155135362181082
Ejection fraction was 38  +/-  14%.	0.7293009739930034
The indication for an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator was in 57% of patients ventricular tachycardia, in 43% ventricular fibrillation.	1.243962999954249
298 patients had a single-chamber cardioverter/defibrillator implanted, 42 patients a dual-chamber cardioverter/defibrillator.	0.8578767504033558
In 25 patients additional subcutaneous patch or array electrodes and in 2 patients additional epicardial patch electrodes were implanted.	0.9196381880694293
Implantation site was in 92 patients abdominal and in 248 pectoral.	0.8374427489495654
Over a period of 7 years 34 lead-related complications occured in 33 patients (9.7%), after a median of 2 months after implantation.	1.300789492252483
Diagnosis was made by routine chest x-ray in about 55% of lead-related complications, by clinical presentation (inadequate therapy, pain) in 24%, and by electrical parameters in 21%.	1.31879419156382
In patients with an abdominal implantation site, lead-related complications occurred in 20%, in contrast to 6% in patients with a pectoral implantation site.	1.4193409387045135
Regarding patients with pectoral implantation site, lead-related complications were observed in 12% of patients with a dual-chamber ICD vs 4% with a single-chamber ICD (p = 0.05), due to dislocation of atrial electrodes with dual-chamber ICD.	1.214972734762078
There were no differences in clinical parameters between patients with pectoral vs abdominal and between single vs dual-chamber ICD.	0.9414620682809844
Several new approaches are available for early defibrillation.	0.9166237488194044
One example is semiautomatic defibrillators used by the first arriving emergency staff.	0.885924933643129
The recommendations for introducing emergency medical technician (EMT) defibrillation in Germany are based either on the results in cities with so called doctor-manned-ambulances or the experiences of the German multi-center-study.	1.0822457698665626
This analysis intends to contribute data to an EMT defibrillation program in cities with a so called rendezvous-system.	0.8310927094213408
Methods: In a prospective study a EMT-defibrillation group (= DG) was compared with a standard group (basic life support by EMTs and defibrillation by emergency physicians) (= SG) and a control group (emergency physicians starting resuscitation alone or together with EMTs) (= CG).	1.265357498045235
In the DG semiautomatic defibrillators from Laerdal (Heartstart 3000) were used.	0.925566193479926
Successfully resuscitated patients were followed up with the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), the Pittsburgh Brain Stem Score (PBSS), and Pittsburgh Cerebral (CPC) and Overall Performance Categorie (OPC).	1.0419128303493759
Results: Over 13 months 43 patients were included, primarily presenting with ventricular fibrillation (VF).	1.057089912264063
Depending on the first arriving emergency staff the patients were allocated to the DG (n = 12), to the SG (n = 18) or to the CG (n = 13).	1.2986121083755735
DG and SG did not differ significantly concerning the primary survival rate or the long-term prognosis (primary successful 8.3% vs. 38.9%, definite successful 0% vs. 27.8%).	1.0981603118584098
The primary survival rate in the DG was significantly lower than in the CG (8.3% vs. 61.5%).	0.9355959320453253
In the long term survival rate there were no significant differences.	0.9913190722884515
In the DG significantly less patients received bystander CPR (8.3%) than in the other groups (55.6% and 69.2%).	1.1344425571123686
Neither the variable "witnessed collapes" nor "bystander CPR" had a significant influence for the outcome of the patients in this study.	1.1756090169672972
The average response time for the first arriving rescue team was 5.5 +/- 2.4 min, without a significant difference between the groups.	1.2840240709775996
Conclusions: A comparison of this study with American, European and German recommendations for EMT defibrillation programms revealed some deviations.	1.307400643886678
Bystander CPR seems to be of special importance as well as the time interval between defibrillation and the arrival of the emergency physician.	1.1953990648388861
A benefit of EMT defibrillation could not be demonstrated in our "rendezvous-system", possibly because the time interval was less than 4 min (3.5 min).	1.3309341116694284
Since the result is in accordance with the German multi-center-study, a critical consideration of a EMT defibrillation program seems to be necessary in "Rendezvous-systems".	1.1481584393055724
Ninety-two strains of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE) from 80 patients of 31 hospitals in 11 federal states were analyzed.	0.9834076521128552
They were primarily isolated in intensive care units (general, surgical, internistic, pediatric, oncological ones), but also in nephrologic/dialysis or neurologic/orthopaedic wards.	1.1499175332019989
A dominance of VanA type E. faecium strains was observed (n=81; 88.0%).	0.9190966260197504
In addition, strains of E. faecalis (VanA; n=4; 4.4%), E. faecium (VanB; n=1; 1.1%), and E. gallinarum (VanC1, n=6; 6.5%) were found.	1.2550642688570905
The 81 VanA strains of E. faecium possessed the following resistances to other antibiotics: erythromycin, ciprofloxacin (both 93.8%), ampicillin, oxytetracycline (both 88.9%), rifampicin (79.0%), trimethoprim/sulfameracin (61.7%), chloramphenicol (18.9%), fusidic acid (12.3%), quinupristin/dalfopristin (7.4%); gentamicin (46.9%) and streptomycin (37.0%), also together with ampicillin resistance (9.9-35.8%).	1.1816242178866325
In some of these VanA type strains resistance to teicoplanin cannot be completely expressed in-vitro.	0.9015354194390256
Macrorestriction analysis of E. faecium outbreak isolates (VanA type) from hospitals in different federal states indicated an intra- and interhospital spread of a defined strain.	1.131233955070153
However, heterogeneous plasmid and plasmid restriction patterns showed that these strains were not completely identical.	1.092153235410147
The scapulothoracic dissociation (SD) is a complex injury of the shoulder girdle, mostly associated with polytraumatized critically ill patients.	1.1158254852781153
This case report of 3 patients shows the variety of possible injuries combined with SD.	1.1300654824904954
Diagnosis and therapy in such a rare trauma, which is most likely seen in specialized trauma centres are being described.	1.2570291517695773
The 3 patients are presented from trauma to management, with remarks to various possibilities in treatment.	1.121993430897429
Reports of other groups include multicenter studies with small numbers of patients, making it different to look for homogenity or defining standards, whereas current guidelines are being mentioned, including remarks on the management of these mostly polytraumatized and vitally endangered patients.	1.0304996948354983
This is a case report on arthroscopic removal of a glass splinter from the knee joint of a 56-year-old male.	1.091024476071679
Recurrent hemarthrosis of the knee was the reason for differential diagnosis, as the patient could not remember any trauma.	1.3557693600099272
After performing MRI, a 12 x 5 mm signal-free zone showed up in the area of the lateral condylus femoris, which was identified through arthroscopy as a glass splinter and removed.	1.1543074941338625
The patient was discharged soon after without any complaints.	0.9886140989510597
Many patients with acquired strabismus do not suffer from diplopia and confusion after an individually and age-dependent interval.	0.9051834770477934
They inhibit the image of the deviated eye by binocular rilvary and particularly by the physiological ability to disregard visually disturbing stimuli.	0.8554508149489671
Red cells, platelet concentrates and fresh frozen plasma of a single donation contain leucocytes, causing a lot of side effects.	0.9625769919074841
Modern filtration- and apheresis-techniques lead to a reduction of residual leucocyte counts of <1x106 per unit.	1.0626375063059996
The best method to achieve controlled and validated conditions is the blood bank performed standardised prestorage-filtration.	0.8819785777469644
This is an effective method, to prevent cytokine-mediated and leucocyte-mediated febrile nonhaemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTR), to prevent a primary immunisation to leucocyte- and histocompatibility-antigens, to avoid transmission of viral infections by blood transfusion, e.g.	1.1643304180992367
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and to exclude in special cases bacterial septicaemia.	1.094824552533415
In addition, there are references to reduce the postoperative infections, the rate of recurrence of a tumor and the postoperative complications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.	1.4222981238785497
The use of leucocyte-depleted blood components for special indications is meanwhile established.	0.8079821116629395
Some European countries have made a decision for a general filtration of all blood components containing leucocytes.	0.9547748793272732
The authors recommend the general leucocyte-depletion of blood components considering the German medical law (AMG) and cost/benefit ratio.	1.0352319215859442
Evaluation of psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacological treatment frequently uses rating scales without regard for patients' defensiveness.	0.8152657542691532
This study demonstrates on 309 psychotherapy patients treated with inpatient client-centered therapy and followed-up 1 year after treatment that defensiveness, measured with validity scales of personality inventories MMPI-K, FPI-R and Gießen-Test, influences ratings (scales CGI, HAMA, HAMD, BRMES) before and after therapy.	0.9118879801820424
Patients who deny psychopathology on admission do so at discharge and to some extent at follow-up.	0.616598184371438
The extent of effect is significantly diminished with an increase in frankness in these patients, indicated by the significant improvement in validity scales.	0.8905734481751337
Inpatient client-centered psychotherapy improved defensiveness in the case of initial self-criticism and diminished it in the case of initial retentiveness.	1.0540255532954463
Introduction: Because of their frequency and consequences sciatica remains a demanding clinical entity with significant social and economical impact.	1.099016558701725
There is a high demand on therapeutic modalities, using folk medicine methods in the treatment of orthopaedic  diseases.	1.1170819253639452
No data is available on the usefullness of methods like natural herbs in combination with acupuncture.	0.824017453634944
Aim of our study was to present data on the effect of acupuncture and cytokineinhibiting natural herbs in sciatic pain.	0.8523871942753936
We compared these  results with nerve root infiltration by local anaesthetics and corticosteroids in our  orthopaedic outpatient clinic.	1.0429951215727682
Materials and Results: 278 patients with chronic pain for at least 3 months were observed.	1.1965056643218537
All three therapeutical modalities showed improvement of pain scores.	0.709990359765581
Best  results were gained with steroid injection (n=26; 66% pain reduction), acupuncture in combination with herbs improved the pain in average of 62% (n=230), whereas injection with local anaesthetic had a pain reduction of 48% (n=22).	1.1748195594164559
Sole Mepivacain-HCl treatment had significant less pain reduction compared to the other treatment modalities.	1.01929560215828
Conclusion: According to our results acupuncture in combination with herbs and  steroid nerve blocks appear to be an effective and thus recommendable conservative  therapy in cases of sciatic pain.	1.1047444999513112
Taking into account that patients increasingly prefer ethnomedical modalities of treatment our study gains importance for practising  orthopaedists.	0.9411602887870375
This paper concerns advances in the integration of psychotherapy in psychiatric education and clinical practice and whether they go along with increasing research activities.	1.0083309879011397
To find answers, a survey on psychotherapy research was carried out in all German psychiatric hospitals and departments by means of a questionnaire.	1.1042684328285879
The results indicate that psychotherapy research is done nearly exclusively in university hospitals.	0.7872979065771578
About half of them had already published psychotherapy studies and two thirds of them are presently carrying out studies, mostly including prospective, randomized clinical trials.	1.0918942213775629
These studies cover the whole spectrum of psychiatric disorders: substance abuse, schizophrenic and affective disorders, anxiety, and obsessive compulsive and personality disorders.	0.8658674893263656
To improve psychotherapy research conditions further, efforts are necessary to increase scientific exchange, financial support, and the integration of institutions outside the universities.	1.153765054353819
There is little to suggest that the course of preeclamsia can be substantially affected by drug treatment.	1.0054536426275946
The vast majority of randomized studies do not indicate beneficial effects of antihypertensive treatment on proteinuria, fetal heart rate abnormalities, abruptio placentae and the incidence of preterm birth.	0.9146115372571899
There is also no definite effect on the development of superimposed preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome, renal failure or eclampsia.	0.9838469550367993
Moreover, blood pressure lowering agents fail to improve uteroplacental perfusion but may have adverse effects on fetal growth.	1.131486699183039
Antihypertensive treatment is only indicated in severe hypertension ( > 170/110 mm Hg) to reduce the risk of cerebral hemorrhage.	1.1297180363812411
Dihydralazine injections may result in reduced placental blood flow and fetal distress.	0.8941831702661417
Oral nifedipine offers some advantages in view of more potent vasodilator actions on uterine and fetoplacental vessels and a lower incidence of fetal distress.	1.0024078955449902
Increasing evidence suggests that the mechanism of eclamptic seizure is cerebral vasoconstriction with resultant ischemia.	0.7900257930195296
Cerebral vessels are particularly sensitive to magnesium, which works by reversing cerebral vasoconstriction with resultant improvement in blood flow.	0.9576287095481006
Controlled trials have shown magnesium to be superior to both placebo and phenytoin for the prevention of eclampsia.	0.8897188651210107
Furthermore, magnesium has been found to be more effective than diazepam and phenytoin in preventing recurrence of seizures in women with eclampsia.	1.1841012479765016
Also the neonatal outcome favors magnesium, which is now generally accepted as the drug of choice for the prevention and treatment of eclampsia.	1.1046886466674826
Baker's cysts were treated operatively in 19 patients in the Department of Traumatology of the University of Cologne from 1988 to 1997.	1.0284162099227918
The subjective and objective results were evaluated with a questionnaire and a clinical examination and sonography (follow-up: 95 %).	1.047364527878371
All patients were examinated before surgery, sonography and X-ray of the knee were performed.	1.205265847449539
We differentiated between the congenital primary cyst (39 %), and the secondary form, which was always associated with an intraarticular lesion (61 %).	1.2206733493853945
Arthroscopy was performed in all secondary forms of Baker's cyst.	0.8885437463306766
Postoperative complications were two reinterventions due to one hematoma and one effusion.	0.8578475865369136
Patient's evaluation of operation result was "excellent" in 61 % and "good" in 39 % of cases.	1.1633661618658249
All knee joints had a full range of motion.	0.6657875519287433
There was only one case of a recurrent cyst.	1.2381541305851547
The primary form of Baker's cyst has always to be extirpated, according to our clinical experience.	0.8735735613466563
The extirpation of the secondary Baker's cyst and the relevance of arthroscopy and treatment of the basic disease have to be discussed.	1.045404636710248
In median avcuate ligament syndrome, compression of the celiac artery is caused by an abnormally low insertion of the median arcuate ligament in the presence of normally located celiac and superior mesenteric arteries.	0.9339061590257968
A lot of controversy exists concerning the indication for operation and the best mode of treatment.	0.9021254154156162
Depending on the presence and quality of collateral pathways, the symptoms vary considerably.	1.2607604229433056
We report a rare case of arcuate ligament syndrome with two-vessel involvement.	0.9074577595695498
In such cases surgical treatment seems to offer substantial benefit.	0.9975815710115934
Usually transsection of the compressing arcuate ligament is sufficient.	0.6894882606094412
Bypass procedures should remain limited to cases in which transsection does not enable a significant increase in splanchnic blood flow.	0.9011989040018171
The microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood films for the diagnosis of malaria is a highly sensitive technique.	0.9371563939997136
However, the expertise required is a major disadvantage.	1.1645924781271741
Recently, methods not dependent on microscopy have become commercially available.	1.0041677351720546
The use of an antigen-capture assay for the detection of histidine-rich protein 2, an antigen specific for Plasmodium falciparum, forms the basis of the ParaSight-F (Becton Dickinson) and the ICT Malaria Pf test (ICT Diagnostics).	1.09069594139499
Parasite lactate dehydrogenase is the basis of another immunographic dipstick assay developed by Flow Inc.	0.8831168797846646
These currently available assays have been evaluated in a number of trials giving sensitivities and specificities of 90-100%.	0.8261112155647498
A decreased sensitivity is found in cases with low parasitemia.	0.9727068379960199
However, false-negative  results have also been reported in patients with high parasite densities.	1.2980496015239753
Purpose: Discussion in the literature of peripheral nerve lesions after surgical treatment is based mainly on orthopedic surgery or on ischemic syndromes.	1.2951991601092074
There is no information about the frequency of nerve lesions after revascularization of the lower limb.	1.0170690064276742
Methods: Between 1992 and 1996, 436 patients underwent peripheral arterial revascularization, including 147 cases of deep revascularization, 127 supra-genicular femoro-popliteal bypasses, 116 infra-genicular femoro-popliteal bypasses and 56 femoro-crural bypasses.	0.9103308360101293
Mean patient age was 70.5 +/- 5.8 years; 182 patients were female and 254 were male.	0.8043031859366706
There was a 38% rate (166/436) of reoperation.	1.1484468885509702
All patients were examined based on anamnestic information and a detailed clinical neurological investigation, including the methods of Weber and Moberg.	1.1786002167942515
Results: We found eleven patients (4%) with peripheral nerve lesions after the primary operation.	1.4636793969571162
After the reoperation 55 patients (33%) had nerve lesions.	1.004095302487489
Conclusions: Peripheral nerve lesions with sensory disturbance were present in 15% of our patients on discharge from hospital.	1.2592218186900972
They had mainly dysesthesia and hypesthesia but no kind of motor dysfunction.	0.6988892777883033
In our opinion, detailed preoperative information is very important because of the risk of sensitive nerve lesions.	0.9142722513469816
Classic and HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) are predominantly found in male Caucasians.	1.05358394364875
It is unclear why KS is so rare in women.	0.8159105009005997
At the Department of Dermatology, University of Frankfurt, epidemic KS was diagnosed in 299/751 (40%) male and 5/72 (18%) female HIV-infected patients.	1.0250614569589902
To detect common parameters regarding immunodeficiency, hormonal disturbances, abnormalities in clinical course, or sexual practices, data of eight women with KS (five HIV+, three HIV-) were compared.	1.223721486384496
In HIV+ women KS is more aggressive than in HIV- women and more aggressive than in HIV+ men.	0.9625634959367169
Early and frequent visceral involvement and no preference for the lower extremities are found.	0.978900295320123
Compared to HIV- women with KS, HIV+ women are generally younger (mean age 38 vs 71 years) and significantly immunodeficient (reduced absolute CD4 cell count and CD4/CD8 ratio).	1.0548022400588524
All women with KS investigated for sexual hormones (7/8) showed abnormalities: 7/7 had low oestrogens, 4/6 low LH and 3/5 low progesterone.	1.2002224753781088
Controls (n=11, HIV+ without KS) showed a clear trend for higher serum levels of sexual hormones, but the difference was not significant.	1.0688290242601017
Although different reasons for low levels of oestrogens (drug abuse, marasmus, menopause) must be considered, the lack of oestrogens seems to be a common finding in HIV+ and HIV- women with KS.	1.0417613853311969
There was no correlation between sexual practices (anal or oral-faecal contacts) and the manifestation or aggressiveness of KS.	1.1010580380205912
The aim of the study was the assessment of left ventricular (LV) systolic function and left ventricular mass following aortic valve replacement (AVR) due to aortic valve stenosis as well as the influence of regression of LV hypertrophy in patients with normal and impaired LV systolic function prior to surgery.	1.153847685187194
74 patients with severe aortic valve stenosis (29 female, 45 male, mean age 66  +/-  18 years) were divided into 2 groups according to LV ejection fraction (EF): Group 1 with EF > 50% (n = 40); Group 2 with EF <= 50% (n = 34).	1.349683474299234
Furthermore, patients were differentiated into a group A without (n = 53) and a group B with aortic regurgitation (<= II °, n = 21).	1.4047474158587976
All patients were examined by transthoracic echocardiography before and 1 month after surgery.	1.2212365947481896
There was a significant decrease of LV enddiastolic and endsystolic valume indices following AVR in group 2 and group B.	1.0229588317229552
Patients with preoperatively lower EF (group 2) showed an increase in LV ejection fraction from 39  +/-  10% before AVR to 47  +/-  11% after AVR (p < 0.001), whereas patients with preoperative normal EF (group 1) showed a significant decrease in EF (from 62  +/-  8% to 57  +/-  10%, p < 0.05).	1.1596401061008639
Also patients with combined aortic valve disease before AVR had an increase of EF after surgery (from 45 %plusmn; 14% to 56  +/-  14%, p < 0.03).	1.0507463882802077
There were significant decreases of interventricular septum thickness and LV posterior wall thickness in group 1 and group A, whereas a significant decrease of LV anddiastolic diameter index was noted only in group B.	1.0774452043379243
Improvement of the NYHA functional class could be demonstrated in group 2 from 2.8  +/-  0.7 before to 2.2  +/-  0.6 after AVR, as well as in group B from 2.9  +/-  0.7 before to 1.9  +/-  0.7 after surgery.	1.232212390636398
In conclusion, patients with impaired LV function or combined aortic valve disease showed a significant improvement of left ventricular systolic function after AVR, while patients with normal LV function presented a slight decrease of EF.	1.2319965293477826
There was a significant regression of left ventricular muscle mass in all groups independent of the left ventricular functional status.	1.2489308670531774
Cardiomyocytes lose the ability to proliferate after birth.	0.6390567757164153
Subsequently, irreversible cellular damage, e.g., during myocardial infarction, causes loss of functional properties and cell replacement by fibrotic tissue.	1.1203780830339174
It is, therefore, not surprising that cell replacement strategies such as cardiomyocyte transplantation in damaged myocardium or scar tissue has gained widespread interest.	0.9635187756851401
In other species such as mice, rats, and dogs, the technical feasibility of skeletal myoblast-, satellite cell-, and fetal cardiomyocyte engraftment into normal and diseased myocardium has been demonstrated by simple injection methods.	1.1828275384085
Repeatedly, it has been shown that transplanted cells may survive for weeks within host myocardium and build intercellular connections such as grap junctions and desmosomes.	1.0014032093224556
In contrast, grafthost connections have not, as yet, been convincingly demonstrated.	1.0458134629713611
Hypothetically, cell transplants might exhibit the following functional properties: stabilization of diseased tissue to prevent structural remodeling; carrier for recombinant proteins, growth factors or drugs to induce molecular alterations of host myocardium; and improvement of regional and global myocardial function due to active contractility.	0.9836886185132149
However, clear evidence of coordinated contractility of transplanted cells, and, thus, of a clinically relevant therapeutical use of cardiomyocyte transplantation as a replacement strategy for damaged host cardiac cells, remains to be demonstrated.	1.214536772714065
Concomitant with advances in medicine, involving the development and use of antibiotics, immunosuppressive drugs, organ / stem cell transplantation and pre-existing illnesses such as AIDS, the frequency of fungal infection has increased dramatically.	1.0334529038710498
These factors determine the susceptibility of the lung for an acute or chronic course of disease.	1.0244766183323955
Purpose: We evaluated the speed of sound (SOS) and broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) at the os calcis as an indicator of osteoporosis and observed the age-related changes in ultrasound values in normal women.	1.187987838509978
Materials and methods: BUA and SOS were measured in 236 women using the "Achilles" densitometer (Lunar, Madison, Ohio).	0.9051127120433495
From the BUA and SOS values the BUA/SOS Index ("Stiffness" Index) is calculated.	1.0019127530064884
We investigated 55 female patients with osteoporosis (aged 43-85 years) and 181 healthy women (aged 20-80 years).	1.1194309467165284
Results: Ultrasound values for women with osteoporosis were significantly lower than those for the normal control group.	1.203020216099905
The Z-score compared with young normals was higher for the BUA/SOS Index (-3.1) than for BUA (-2.5) and SOS (-3.0).	1.2852351569609939
At a BUA/SOS Index of 68 the sensitivity was 85 %, and the specificity was 77 % for patients with osteoporotic fractures.	1.2728040243666536
We found a significant decline with age in SOS (r = -0.55), BUA (r = -0.50) and BUA/SOS Index (r = -0.57).	0.8465364023715484
Conclusion: Ultrasound bone densitometry at the os calcis can be used as a screening test in the diagnosis of osteoporosis.	1.1501312999672322
A treatment procedure requires the consent of the patient, but this is legally effective only if he is capable of giving his consent and can be informed accordingly.	0.9809950020756257
Because of demographic development and the progress of medicine, the number of patients who are not able to give their consent is increasing.	1.0972260350004688
In practice, we make do with the presumed consent of the patient or, for procedures that can wait, with the consent of legitimate family members.	1.2733159558918343
An initiative action is suggested by physicians and hospitals that should reduce this gray zone and the forensic risks drastically.	0.8850410308380581
A number of studies has shown a significant relationship between life events/life conditions and depression.	0.9397590942738403
However, there is only a small number of studies investigating the effect of life events/life conditions in patients with severe depression from the endogenous subtype.	1.2945428820457712
The present study examines the significance of the patients' life events/life conditions for the two year outcome of the illness in a prospective study with assessments every three months.	1.3177826114325255
Patients are compared to healthy controls with regard to the period three months prior to the admission to the hospital at the index episode.	1.1051476552879054
The results confirm the importance of life events and life conditions for the long term outcome of depressed patients with endogenous subtype respectively severe major depression in-patients.	1.1034321197237207
Relapsers show considerably more undesirable life conditions than non-relapsers three to six months prior to their relapse.	0.8296779745511446
Depressed patients indicate significantly more undesirable life events and life conditions and fewer desirable life conditions in comparison to the control group for the time span three months prior to their hospitalisation.	1.029820733613957
Since the availability of protease inhibitors in 1997, there has been a great change in antiretroviral therapy but also new long term side effects have emerged, mainly metabolic changes such as hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterinemia and hyperglycemia.	0.9569171905782495
Besides, fat redistribution has been observed.	0.6513911904394001
Fat wastes in the face and limbs but accumulates in the adipose tissue of the dorsocervical and abdominal region and the breasts.	0.907538877379842
The mechanism of these changes remains unclear.	0.8579006300869436
For therapy a protease inhibitor free therapy or lipid lowering drugs may be tried.	0.7982719068212131
29 of our 224 patients developed lipodystrophy.	0.7107602350620053
27 of these patients had been treated with a protease inhibitor (17 patients with indinavir); 2 of the patients had never received protease inhibitors.	1.3449208968973214
Background: The Low-Vision-Enhancement-System (LVESR) is the first binocular optoelectronic rehabilitation device with variable focus distance.	1.2053292001226719
DNA-cytophotometry is one of the methods that may contribute to a more precise evaluation of the biological behaviour of tumours in addition to the WHO-classification.	1.2970451667603273
In this study 121 tumour specimens of 50 patients suffering from gliomas with one or up to three recurrencies were investigated.	1.0516785159935385
In all cases the histological type and WHO-grade and the Ki-67/MIB1 labeling index were determined.	0.9928063053867888
DNA cytophotometry was performed after single cell preparation on Feulgen-stained preparations, and the following parameters were calculated: stemline ploidy, 5c-exceeding rate, and 2c-deviation index.	1.0932185709042999
There is a world-wide renaissance of neurosurgical treatments of Parkinson's disease (PD), based on substantial progress in basic sciences.	0.9570436942396656
A model of parallel motor circuitry has identified potential targets for lesioning by clarifying the pathophysiological role of the basal ganglia in PD.	0.8994126520388576
The internal globus pallidus (Gpi) is an essential player as it connects to thalamocortical projections and can be disinhibited by overactivity of the nucleus subthalamicus (Nst).	1.0051479813283501
Lesioning of these targets has been successful in MPTP damaged primates.	0.746532674382728
There is clinical use of destructive as well as restorative and stimulative technics.	0.8781278962807963
Pallidotomy and thalamatomy have evolved by the use of better neuroradiological and electrophysiological targeting.	0.7836130407521332
The first technic is used for treatment of rigidity, hypokinesia and dyskinesias, the latter one has proven to be efficient for tremor.	1.07505471195393
Dopaminergic reinnervation and increased dopaminergic output of the striatum has only been seen after transplantation of fetal cells; this method however carries immunological and ethical problems.	1.0061431283638274
The continuous high frequency stimulation of basal ganglia is the newest technic; it is highly adaptable to the patient's need and carries a low morbidity profile.	1.1542805978008643
Thalamic stimulation is used for the treatment of tremor.	0.9510991573705485
The stimulation of Nst and Gpi are proposed for dyskinesias and on/off phenomena.	0.7619658724704568
Animal research further focuses on xenotransplantation and implantation of genetically transformed cells or pluripotent precursor cells.	0.7819248700559353
- In summary neurosurgical procedures seem to be verey promising; however longterm comparison studies are needed to define the best (combination) treatment(s) for the future.	1.1614112249365385
Concepts of documentation rely not only on the contents required and technical demands, but the procedures covered and in medical applications especially security aspects are also matters of critical concern.	1.0934583973172163
Even though the need for effective documentation (i.e., adequate in content, availability, feasibility and easy to retrieve analysis) is not a question, tasks and aims (for example, quality of patient care) deserve attention and establishing efforts have to be analyzed regarding their structural and personal prerequisites and implications before particular tools for documentation can be developed.	1.0940522178493792
The Medtronic Thera/Thera-i (and Kappa 400) pacemakers utilize a mode switching algorithm that switches from the DDD/R mode to the DDIR mode in the presence on an atrial tachyarrhythmia.	0.9419846997439552
To accomplish this, the pacemaker keeps track of a mean atrial rate (MAR) which is a weighted index of the atrial rate.	1.2130710736144885
Once the MAR is greater than the programmed mode switch rate the pacemaker mode switches to the nontracking mode.	0.8050797911637945
Because the algorithm weights faster atrial rates more heavily than slow atrial rates, the algorithm is sensitive to a wide variety of atrial tachyarrhythmias, including those with varying amplitudes.	1.0957992504483798
Additionally, the algorithm provides a long PVARP and a rate adaptive (RA) AV interval.	0.9561876550685336
These not only help ensure that a wide range of atrial rates will be detected, but may also limit the time the patient tracks at the upper rate before mode switching.	1.1361629595430562
In order to assess the effectiveness of the algorithm, the Thera-i provides detailed diagnostics which provide information on the date, time, duration, and rate of the mode switch episodes.	1.1835388810675498
Additionally, more detailed beat-to-beat information is provided for each episode which can help determine its appropriateness and can assist in making programming changes.	1.156877883372721
There is a lot of information in the literature about psychological disturbances in somatic diseases.	1.212012958801609
For dermatological patients such data are not available.	0.6963707189221631
In early spring 1998 we studied the psychological changes in 247 hospitalized patients in the dermatological department of the Ruhr University Bochum.	0.9503920896995316
We used the German version of the internationally accepted Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.	0.7881470517385512
We found the prevalance of psychological alterations ranged between 25,9% and 31%.	1.0565343834291594
The prevalence of psychological disturbances was a little higher than that seen in oncological, cardiological or neurological patient populations.	0.9783344707578899
Surprisingly skin cancer patients were less affected than patients with chronic inflammatory or angiological diseases.	1.0450410885143029
These results underline the necessity of improved psychological therapeutical strategies which must be standardized and evaluated.	0.726850943826652
In an analysis of 3,838 restrained car drivers, the proportion of acceleration related injury of the cervical spine increased from under 10 % in 1985 to over 30 % in 1997.	1.271581916083552
These injuries occurred mainly in the case of head-on or multiple collisions.	0.9776331141896072
Letters were sent to 1,136 of the injured persons, and of the 138 patients who returned the questionnaires, 121 (88 %) were still suffering from their symptoms.	1.1520761127137984
It was a question of pain (74 %), tension (6 %) and stiffness (5 %) in the head (27 %), neck (55 %) and shoulder (8 %) area.	1.420056574104648
The duration of the complaints was the longest after multiple collisions.	0.9206894453461976
In addition to a slight influence of the accompanying injuries on the duration of complaints, the individual constitution seems to be an important determining factor.	1.2968010372602976
In order to resolve the difficulties of conducting of this retrospective study, prospective studies are necessary which include documentation of diagnosis, treatment protocols, duration and type of complaints.	1.1246606633701117
Large B-cell neoplasms represent one of the most frequent groups of non-Hodgkin-lymphomas (30-40%).	1.1066869107948052
They are characterised by an aggressive clinical course.	0.7904429349720267
These lymphomas may evolve either de novo or secondary during the course of a less aggressive lymphoma.	0.8742591440945031
In addition to primary nodal, a primary extranodal manifestation is rather common.	1.1870630231378951
The neoplastic cells, even within one given case, show a broad morphological spectrum.	1.0920713480023267
Several findings of the last two decades have revealed that the large B-cell lymphomas represent an inhomogeneous group.	1.1344604887687555
This fact has been taken into account by the new WHO classification of malignant lymphomas.	1.0648934005472284
There are two groups identified, that of the variants and that of the subtypes.	1.2395874354303493
The various variants (centroblastic, immunoblastic, anaplastic, T-cell/histiocyte-rich) correspond to lymphomas without reproducible discriminating criteria lacking characteristic clinical, immunophenotypical and genetic findings.	0.9243445344827521
In contrast, the primary mediastinal, the intravascular, the primary effusion and primary central nervous system lymphomas represent distinct disease entities.	1.2391010269321465
A number of recently described large cell lymphoma types, i. e. plasmablastic, ALK-positive and primary gastric, are included in the classification, their designation as distinct entities is still under discussion.	1.0844635925802457
In the presented study, knee joint proprioception of 43 patients with a patellar pain syndrome of the knee joint was evaluated.	1.2451193739350137
In a control group, the proprioception of 30 healthy volunteers with clinical and anamnestic inconspicous knee joints was examined.	0.9615704294737476
We tested the proprioceptive capability of the subjects with a passive angle reproduction test.	0.8506532296636837
Additionally, all knee joints were measured with and without an elastic knee bandage.	1.3050135987634015
The patient group showed significant deterioration of angle reproduction capability (13.2  °  +/-  6.1  °) compared to the control group (7.8  °  +/-  2.8  °).	1.171645657958508
After applying an elastic knee bandage, the angle reproduction capability significantly improved to 9.2  °  +/-  4.5  °.	1.219962069848735
Proprioception of the contralateral, noninvolved knee joint in the patients (11.6  °  +/-  6.3  °) was worse compared to the control group.	1.2901966111855765
Applying an elastic knee bandage did not significantly improve the proprioception of the uninjured knee joint.	0.8606335281584533
Atrial fibrillation is the most commonly encountered sustained arrhythmia in men.	1.142425643985476
It is associated with a two-fold mortality risk and an increased cost for health care providers.	0.9271446111662051
The relative inefficacy and the risks of pharmacologic approaches to atrial fibrillation therapy have contributed to increasing efforts to address atrial fibrillation with curative ablative strategies.	0.9347202364063618
Ablation approaches for atrial fibrillation focus on two alternate strategies: ablation of the substrate for initiation and ablation of the substrate for maintenance of atrial fibrillation.	0.7237229510093051
It has been demonstrated that atrial fibrillation may be initiated by repetitive atrial premature beats originating from a single focus.	1.0181953554497618
These ectopic foci can be mapped and ablated, thereby removing the substrate for initiation of atrial fibrillation.	0.8622577961335708
Most often, these atrial premature beats arise from the pulmonary veins.	1.019708044467944
A challenge in trying to ablate the trigger is actually having enough spontaneous activity from the said focus throughout the electrophysiologic study.	0.7599213564057318
To sidestep the need of mapping, pure anatomic approaches are currently under investigation to electrically isolate the pulmonary veins from the atrial myocardium by circumferential lesions.	0.9502560574913347
In patients without a defined trigger for atrial fibrillation, efforts were made to ablate the substrate for maintenance of atrial fibrillation.	0.9068760253168477
Strong evidence exists that atrial fibrillation is the result of multiple coexisting reentrant wavelets requiring a critical myocardial mass to perpetuate.	0.898097488551672
Several working groups demonstrated that intraoperative compartmentalization of the myocardial tissue by surgical incisions or radiofrequency pulses is highly effective in preventing atrial fibrillation.	0.8859059905122975
Currently, attempts were made to reproduce the surgical technique using transveneous, catheter-based approaches.	1.0940646787306652
Though our knowledge of ablation techniques and technical prerequisites is continuously increasing, the difficulty to produce complete linear lesions in the left atrium and local thrombus formation at the ablation line are problems that are still not solved.	1.109421067491484
Using a time-budget method in a 3 year longitudinal study with a control group design, substantial reductions in the engagement of non-obligatory instrumental, social, and leisure activities could be found in a group of mildly to moderately demented patients.	1.030213797397742
Controlling these changes for differences in baseline paramters, the dementia-specific reduction was about 1,5 hours compared to a non-psychiatric control group.	1.0918194659839233
These clinically relevant changes in activity levels underscore the importance of these activity domains with regard to the development of diagnostically useful indicators at the early stages of dementia.	0.9997648020940597
Time-budget methods seem to be particularly useful to close the diagnostic gap with regard to the assessment of everyday competence indicators especially at early stages of the dementia illness.	1.088312155632869
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a disease with different etiological, morphological, functional, clinical and therapeutic aspects.	1.2006207137786924
Recent investigations indicate that HCM is considerably widespread in the population (1:500).	1.0499911807346194
The causes seem to generate from familial or sporadic abnormalities (mutations).	0.8257493909520381
Depending on the clinical aspect, the complaints, and on the basis of morphologic and hemodynamic investigational results, we mainly have to consider two types of medical and surgical management.	1.2750398928281756
Atrial fibrillation is in 20-50% the most frequent dysrhythmia after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and a possible cause for hemodynamical complications and prolongation off the medical treatment in patients.	1.2987183284662125
Therefore, the effect of -blocking with metoprolol for prevention of supraventricular arrhythmias (SVA) was investigated in a prospective and randomized trial.	1.1978643841665242
200 patients after CABG were randomized in a drug and control group (average age 63.2 years, 154 male, 46 female).	0.9791474141021134
Patients of the drug group (n=100) were treated with metoprolol (1mg/kg/BW) beginning on day one after operation, whereas patients of the control group (n=100) received therapy only in case of occurrence of atrial fibrillaton.	1.1052436589183363
ECG, blood pressure, and electrolyte concentrations were measured regulary until the tenth day after surgery.	0.9307848588957122
Reasons for exclusion were an ejection fraction (< 30%, SA- and AV-block or simultaneous application of epinephrine and metoprolol.	1.2156289099273536
There were no significant differences between the patients of drug and control group with respect to age, sex ejection fraction, previous medication, number and type of bypass grafts, cardiopulmonary bypass time, and perioperative ischemic events.	1.1661729066523896
However, a statistically significant difference was seen in the occurrence of supraventricular arrhythmias in both groups, 4 patients of the therapy group (4%) in contrast to 37 patients of the control (37%) developed supraventricular arrhythmias during the postoperative observation period (p<0.0001).	1.340801851274256
Both groups differed in total time of hospital stay by 1.5 days (control group: 9.83 +/- 2.88 days; drug group: 8.42 +/- 2.81 days), which was statistically significant (p<0.05).	1.0966202393686197
All patients of the drug group could be discharged with a stable sinusrhythm, whereas 7 patients of the control group were discharged with persistent atrial fibrillation.	1.2077869578911606
The difference was statistically significant as well (p<0.01).	0.6513685025214377
Neither typical side effects of metoprolol, nor AV-blocks, bradycardia (f<60/min) or symptoms of low blood pressure could be observed.	1.0593354918453917
The conclusion of this trial is a recommendation for a preventive application of 50mg metoprolol/day after coronary artery bypass surgery, which can reduce the incidence of SVA as well as the hospital stay statistically significant.	1.2088614312164423
Especially by using the "Functional Muscular Diagnostics" described by Janda specific muscular imbalances can be found.	0.8798437108719142
The method is easy to apply and should be used during and before the championship season.	0.9556474320428651
Background: Angiotensin converting  enzyme-inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors) alter the function of the renin-angiotensin-aldesterone-system, which regulates the angiotensin II synthesis.	1.0668126030544447
Angiotensine II is known to be a potent vasoconstrictor.	1.1277980639673406
ACE-inhibitors are used as a standard treatment of arterial hypertension concerning the WHO-guidelines.	1.1814143336937888
The experiences concerning the use of ACE-inhibitors in pediatric patients are  limited.	0.9297759743825355
The frequency of side-effects are not known on a sufficient scientific basis.	1.02291688566886
Evoked potentials (EP) are a valuable tool when assessment of neurocritical care patients is impaired by loss of consciousness and lack of co-operation.	1.0555739229970122
Different modalities of short latency EP can be applied to evaluate sensory, auditory and visual systems.	0.977715811817308
In this review we discuss EP studies in patients with thrombosis of basilar artery, space occupying cerebellar infarction and supratentorial mass lesions of different aetiology.	0.8955386202431422
Paclitaxel, a potent anti-tumor agent, shifts the cytoskeleton equilibrium towards assembly of altered and extraordinarily stable microtubules.	0.9272655043843417
These cellular modifications lead to reduced proliferation, migration, and signal transduction.	0.9824417293560695
It is highly lipophilic, which promotes a rapid cellular uptake, and has a long-lasting effect in the cell due to the structural alteration of the cytoskeleton.	1.3566742919572088
This makes paclitaxel a promising candidate for local drug delivery intended to address the proliferative and migratory processes involved in restenosis.	0.8143247573509256
In this article, results of our in vitro and in vivo studies with paclitaxel are presented.	0.9963101603959436
Cell culture experiments with monocultures of human arterial smooth muscle cells as well as cocultures with human endothelial cells showed that paclitaxel leads to an almost complete growth inhibition within a dose range of 1.0-10.0µmol/l, even after a short (20 min) single dose application.	1.1983020314809265
The comparison of an active, semi-active, and passive delivery system (porous balloon, microporous balloon, and double balloon) favored the double balloon for the following in vivo experiments.	1.1055597630545408
Tubulin staining and electron microscopy enabled visualization of paclitaxel-induced vessel wall alterations.	0.7982708493941192
In the rabbit model, locally delivered paclitaxel resulted in reduced neointima formation and enlargement in vessel size; in the pig model, however, after stenting, this inhibition was not significant.	1.0854483841114406
Both reduced proliferation and enlargement in vessel size contribute to a preservation of vessel shape and are likely to be caused by a structural alteration of the cytoskeleton, which is also supported by vascular contraction force experiments.	1.084018580145778
Atopic eczema is one of the most frequent dermatological diseases, with a still increasing incidence.	1.1378111752834466
Although its etiopathogenesis is still not completely understood, a variety of triggering factors are known.	1.0243819702493162
The following case report describes the clinical course of atopic dermatitis in a 2-year-old boy in whom both IgE-mediated allergic reactions and psychological factors were involved in triggering and maintenance of skin lesions.	1.0625519467197848
This demonstrates how important both dermatological therapy and close cooperation with the field of psychosomatic medicine can be.	0.9549981884744895
Identity development in adolescence may act as stressor triggering juvenile psychotic episodes.	0.7136639556891002
A model is being presented stating that self development in subjects with high vulnerability for psychosis leads to the establishment of an "imaginary self" consisting of phantasies and fictions without taking into account facts and social realities.	0.8810724493155172
The "imaginary self" stabilizes irritating self deficiencies, thus leading to a vulnerability for depersonalisation and identity diffusion during actual turmoils of adaptation.	0.8428850037615426
Biomaterials are defined as non-living materials which are used in interaction with biological systems.	0.8914996887127425
Especially in the field of urology, biomaterials are applied in urinary diversion, urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, and as cosmetic prostheses.	1.1077691926954918
Biomaterial-tissue interaction is caused by the physical and chemical characteristics of the biomaterial, its degradation, and the resulting protein denaturation.	1.3046770945583288
General requirements include biocompatibility and functionality and the avoidance of carcinogenic, mutagenic, toxic, and allergic reactions.	0.9751451296857782
This ist most important when there is permanent contact between urine and epithelial tissue, which may lead to biofilminfection and incrustation.	0.9613979987082327
Continuous modification of known materials, inauguration of new materials, as well as the possibilities of tissue engineering will determine their development in the years to come.	1.092993579458301
Hitherto the question of an indication for psychoanalytic group psychotherapy has not been clarified sufficiently.	1.109669685905991
In this paper, under the premise, that psychoanalytic group psychotherapy is a treatment mode in its own right, the issue is investigated which patients might best profit from the group treatment method.	1.1087971061765058
It is pointed out that the group process itself contains a variety of therapeutic treatment factors which cannot be facilitated through psychoanalytic treatment of just one patient.	0.8789587009149235
First, a series of diagnostic, structural, motivational and cognitive indication criteria are discussed.	0.999934885037643
Second, the moments of a capacity for cohesion and aspects of social relatedness are considered as helpful tools for a formulation of an indication.	1.0648821987716477
As cohesion - according to group treatment outcome research results - has to be viewed as correspondent to the helpful therapeutic alliance, in the context of group psychotherapy, the quest for indication is inextricably linked to patient selection and setting conditions.	1.1840778657248756
The conclusion is that psychoanalytic group psychotherapy, would preferably be indicated for those patients who suffer from constraints of emotional competence as stemming from developmental deficits.	0.8487777150739491
Purpose: To evaluate method- and user effects as well as the required time in the determination of left- and right ventricular ejection fractions in comparing manual and semiautomatic border detection of the endocardium.	1.3006195966376066
The diagnosis of urinary tract infection in renal transplant patients is important because unrecognized bacterial infection may lead - in the worst case - to graft loss.	1.2939522859375494
Between January 1995 and January 1997, we therefore obtained bladder catheter urine samples in 31 female allograft recipients when voided urine samples repeatedly showed pyuria (>=10 WC per microscope field (x40)) and significant bacteriuria (>=;105/ml) combined with vaginal contamination (plenty of squamous epithelial cells, mixed bacterial growth).	1.0849250970615334
Results: In 55 % (17/31), diagnosis of urinary tract infection was confirmed by single bladder catheterization; in 26 % (8/31), urinary tract infection could be excluded, and in 19 % (6/31), bladder colonization without pyuria was found.	1.4784279460634258
Thus, 45 % of the patients with abnormal voided urine samples did not need antimicrobials.	1.2555778516452847
After single dose antibiotic therapy with 500 mg Ciprofloxacin, given immediately after catheterization, no infectious complications occurred.	1.0189872929284938
Diagnostic single bladder catheterization is a simple, safe and - compared to suprapubic aspiration - barely invasive method for the diagnosis or exclusion of urinary tract infection in female renal transplant patients with higher risk for complications due to an acute bladder infection and non-conclusive voided urine samples.	1.1268454470761315
Most people with the Metabolic Syndrome die from thrombotic complications superimposed to degenerative arterial vascular lesions, mostly myocardial infarction.	0.8647712263789075
Type-2-Diabetes is a risk factor per se for such complications, but often clusters with dyslipoproteinemia, hypertension and obesity.	1.2137366757433503
This is referred to as "Metabolic Syndrome" and often operates on a genetically programmed susceptibility which accelerates the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease in front of a much wider diabetes specific cardiopathy.	1.0656326139732335
From a pathophysiological point of view none of these associated risk factors explains the pathogenetic series of events leading to the precipitation of an occlusive thrombus at sites of complicated coronary plaques.	0.9404645940681222
In patients with the Metabolic Syndrome the coagulation system is switched towards a prethrombotic state, involving increased plasmatic coagulation, diminished fibrinolysis, decreased endothelial thromboresistance and predominantly platelet hyperreactivity ("diabetic thrombocytopathy").	1.0328858155588803
Some of these factors are associated with an increased coronary risk (e.g.	0.9026689756595754
fibrinogen, PAI-1, platelets), but are also directly linked to the pathogenesis of "atherothrombosis".	1.1576546944214816
Altered cardiac remodelling together with adhesion and coagulation mechanisms appears suitable to explain decreased functional performance of infarcted organs, decreased success of acute (reduced fibrinolytic response, no reflow phenomenon) and longterm intervention strategies for vessel patency (PTCA, CABG) in Diabetes.	1.113563678900775
Glucose adjustment alone will not adequately neutralize these complex mechanisms, but in the situation of myocardial infarction eumetabolization with parenteral glucose-insulin-potassium infusion appears mandatory similar to non-diabetics.	1.0118191231984122
On the longterm a multidimensional interventional repertoire is required particularly in patients with the Metabolic Syndrome including antihypertensive, antidyslipoproteinemic and antithrombotic drugs, customized according to the individual patients needs as assessed by early diagnostic measures ("early secondary prevention").	1.0600140217306884
The indication for operative treatment in spondylolisthesis results from pain, progressive sliding and, in up to 60 % of the patients with progressive dislocation, from radicular malfunction.	1.253703549164336
The posterolateral fusion in situ is a safe procedure, but the deformation remains and in spondyloptosis plastic deformation of the fusion mass can lead to further dislocation.	1.1577357498324905
With the external fixator as an instrument for reduction and the internal fixator for stabilization the reduction of even serious spondyloptosis and the recovery of a normal spine alignement and posture is possible, with an acceptable neurological risk.	1.1334551200522813
Therefore a concept of treatment is suggested, which as a rule is aiming at the anatomical reduction of the dislocated vertrebra beside stabilization and nerveroot decompression.	1.1003467020570559
Depending on the extent of the slip, reduction and stabilization is to be performed in one, two or three stages.	1.3405259854862899
An anterior or posterior fusion is sufficient in grade I dislocation.	0.823429488663872
In grade II-V a combined posterior and anterior surgical proceedure is recommended.	0.831951029588536
Objectives: This study was conducted to evaluate a modified technique of interskalene brachial plexus anaesthesia (ISB) and postoperative catheter analgesia for shoulder surgery.	1.1823627403752377
The original method described by Winnie bears some rare but life-threatening complications (inadvertent subarachnoid or intra-arterial injection, pneumothorax).	0.9183016685241765
Objectives: Due to its low solubility and negligible metabolism, desflurane is assumed to be especially suitable for application by low-flow anaesthetic techniques.	0.9718573602197517
The aim of this clinical investigation was the development of a standardised dosing scheme for low-flow and minimal-flow desflurane anaesthesia.	1.2089217444721099
Methods: One hundred six ASA status I-II patients were assigned to six groups according to the duration of the initial high-flow phase, fresh gas flow, and fresh-gas desflurane concentration.	1.1226321270714887
The median age, height, body weight, and constitution of the groups was comparable.	1.0498152445989946
After an initial high-flow phase using 4.4 l/min, the fresh gas flow was reduced to 0.5 l/min (minimal-flow anaesthesia) or 1.0 l/min (low-flow anaesthesia).	1.087341703442157
Inspired nitrous oxide concentrations were maintained at 60% to 70%.	0.9875161329987193
Using different standardised schemes of vaporizer settings, inspired desflurane concentrations were applied in the range from 3.4% to 8.7%, i.e., between 1 and 1.5 MAC.	1.3866958025559835
Inspired and expired desflurane concentrations were measured continuously by the side-stream technique and recorded on-line.	0.9450580419228112
Venous blood samples were taken immediately prior to induction and 45 min after flow reduction for measurement of carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) concentration).	0.8455934890847392
Results: In the 10- to 15-min initial phase during which a high fresh gas flow of 4.4 l/min was used, the inspired desflurane concentration reached values in the range of 90%-95% of the fresh gas concentration.	1.3343049579415933
In low-flow anaesthesia this concentration could be maintained without any alteration of the vaporizer setting, whereas in minimal-flow anaesthesia with flow reduction the fresh gas concentration had to be increased by 1% to 2%: The quotient calculated by division of the inspired desflurane concentration by its fresh gas concentration (Q=CI/CF) ranges between 0.65 and 0.75 in minimal-flow and between 0.80 and 0.85 in low-flow anaesthesia.	1.198443895020132
If use was made of the wide output range of the desflurane vaporizer, the inspired concentration could be increased rapidly by about 5% in 8 min, although the flow was kept constant at 0.5 l/min.	1.1807051573393854
Compared with its value prior to induction (2.13 +/- 1.05%), the COHb concentration decreased statistically significantly by about 0.7% during the 1st hour of minimal-flow anaesthesia (1.42 +/- 1.01%).	1.2486246316857725
In no case was a COHb concentration observed that exceeded threatening or even toxic values, although the soda lime was changed routinely only once a week.	0.9280309678819603
Conclusions: The pharmacokinetic properties of desflurane, resulting in especially low individual uptake, and the wide output range of the vaporizer facilitate the use of low-flow anaesthetic techniques in routine clinical practice.	1.1522991398582842
Even in minimal-flow anaesthesia, the duration of the initial high-flow phase can be shortened to min.	0.8218613826189606
If the flow is reduced to 1 l/min, the inspired desflurane concentration achieved in the initial high-flow phase can be maintained without any alteration of the vaporizer setting.	0.8969390621164852
In minimal-flow anaesthesia, however, with flow reduction to 0.5 l/min, the fresh gas concentration has to be increased to a value 1%-2% higher than the inspired nominal value.	1.226570452428178
Due to the wide dialling range of the desflurane vaporizer, the amount of vapour delivered into the breathing system can be increased to about 110 ml/min even at a flow of 0.5 l/min.	0.9859586462710517
The large amount of agent that can be delivered into the system even under low-flow conditions, together with the very low individual uptake, results in a time-constant that is sufficiently short for the clinically required rapid increase in inspired desflurane concentrations.	1.0148326755168038
The short time-constant of low-flow desflurane anaesthesia improves the control of the anaesthetic concentration.	1.054468537167008
If all measures are taken to safely avoid inadvertent drying out of the soda lime, there is no evidence that low-flow anaesthesia with desflurane is liable to increase the risk of accidental ca	1.0000752316970918
Arterial port systems are frequently used in the adjuvant and palliative therapy of colorectal hepatic metastasis.	0.9591807061307513
Specific complications are rarely documented in literature.	0.7432441742401097
The perforation of an arterial Port-a-cath followed by duodenal fistula is an uncommon complication of regional hepatic chemotherapy.	0.9787387590973692
Besides systemic disorders caused by the chemotherapeutic agents, such as vomiting, sickness, or gastritis and duodenitis, gastroduodenal ulcers can occur as a local complication of treatment.	0.9945242337592656
Thrombosis of the hepatic artery or occlusion of the port device are the most common reasons for withdrawal of treatment in our series.	1.118174704721173
Based on our experience and the case report of a duodenal fistula we recommend angiography of the port system prior to each cycle of chemotherapy.	1.0308280416366826
Background: Coenesthesias can be defined as disorders of body perception or body hallucinations, projected in different parts of the body.	1.0646901515004572
Patients complain of intractable pain or dysesthesia.	0.6075844158717
These symptoms are reported even from organs where we usually have no perception.	0.8676588262168046
Coenesthesia must be regarded as a symptom that can be observed in various psychiatric diseases, e.g., schizophrenia.	1.0332560629324403
However, in rare cases coenesthesias can be documented in neurological diseases, e.g., intracranial tumors or infections.	1.0785467515072942
Therefore, accurate assessment of possible differential diagnoses is important.	1.2669121781892214
In late stages, coenesthesias can easily be recognized because of their "bizarre" character.	0.8505214246365413
In early stages, however, patients often complain of intractable, unlocalizable burning pain.	1.115966286095692
They frequently undergo operations because of their great suffering.	0.8028139990499511
The drug treatment of first choice is neuroleptics, but the results are unpredictable.	1.3657034981396536
Question: What risks do different forms of immunosuppression (azathioprine, Cyclosporin, azathioprine/Cyclosporin plus steroids) represent in pregnancy for the mother and fetus after kidney transplantation?	0.9478995693921188
Retrospective analysis of 40 pregnancies and deliveries.	0.7671389873568136
Investigation of abortion -, premature birth rate, fetal retardation, malformation, hospitalization, modus of labour, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal mortality, hypertonia, preeclampsia, anemia, kidney function, rejection crisis, mechanical compression, kidney function after 1 and 5 years postpartum.	1.0655821610984206
Recommendation guideline: preconceptional time (contraception) and intensive care in pregnancy.	1.0009215339163382
The risk of pregnancy is justified if the presuppositions are correct and the woman would urgently like to have a child.	0.9545829879566129
Studies on the everyday life of the elderly often deal with visible behavior.	0.961379574069232
In this study, the subjective experience of the everyday living environment was investigated, paying special consideration to the role of mobility impairment.	1.0746786445644783
Two approaches, one oriented toward the subject's experience of the home environment, another oriented toward the environmental specifics of the individual's favorite place, were employed.	1.0841493315162078
Is the experience of living at home different for individuals with various levelsults were found in the experience of cognitive, biographical, and spatial dimensions of the living environment.	1.0387126256476888
Similarities were found in the experience of emotional, social, and behavioral dimensions of one's home.	1.0234723428060037
Competence loss played an important role in how the subjects experienced living at home, yet even the mobility impaired experienced their home as a environment which could be shaped.	0.9759112361206249
The environment-oriented approach showed that the favorite place of mobility impaired persons was characterized by higher spatial density.	0.9061580757117343
Finally, an examination of four home environment profiles using cluster analysis illustrated the connection between both person- and environment-oriented approaches and offered insights into a transactional perspective of person and environment.	1.0711684516391373
Even though the subjective experience of one's home environment is not easily quantifiable in terms of maintaining everyday competence, it nonetheless imparts meaning to the elderly person's daily life.	1.0698793337740056
The main advantage of the bilateral medial rectus faden operation (posterior fixation suture) for the treatment of essential infantile esotropia is the low occurrence of delayed consecutive exotropia.	1.0064058766924076
Nevertheless, this unwanted complication also occasionally occurs after a faden operation.	1.1122836074736724
We report the rare development of a myoepithelial carcinoma in a pleomorphic adenoma involving the minor salivary glands in the buccal mucosa of a 78-year-old female.	0.9972509951423683
Tumor presented as a small asymptomatic left buccal mass.	0.7510433463496342
The initial dominant component of the neoplasm was a pleomorphic adenoma, while the minor component was a myoepithelial carcinoma.	0.9770050495937757
Recurrences of tumor after 2 and then 5 years were excised.	1.0145167942455178
Histopathological examination of the last tissue removed showed a pure myoepithelial carcinoma of the minor salivary glands without evidence for a pleomorphic adenoma.	0.9688888364833965
The clinical features, therapy, diagnosis, histopathology and literature are reviewed.	0.7315898098657787
The purpose of this prospective study was to determine concomittant lesions of glenohumeral dislocation and their correlation with the outcome, to determine the influence of various stabilizing operation techniques on the outcome.	1.2130607520289545
106 shoulders [104 patients, 81 men, 23 women, mean age 36 (16-83) years] operated because of shoulder instability after at minimum one shoulder luxation between 1988 to 1995 were evaluated 3 years (0.8-8 years) postoperatively using Constant score.	1.190922705021399
Preoperative arthroscopy was performed to document intraarticular lesions.	1.0443772352883103
There were 7 reluxations (5 because of a new accident), mostly after Putti-Platt procedures.	1.339239819587979
The average modified Constant Score was 66 (10-85) points (maximum 85).	0.9974349470220916
29 patients (27%) had less than 60 points, mostly because of pain and restriction of function, and were evaluated as poor.	1.1809802371711227
Lesions of rotator cuff, long biceps tendon and subscapularis tendon had a bad prognosis.	0.8638330539364372
The severity of arthroscopically found lesions correlated with the outcome.	0.8585146192632187
Operations with shortening of subscapularis tendon or using a bone graft gave bad results.	0.8068662644792565
Anatomic reconstruction of the labrum-ligament complex in combination with a plasty of the extended capsule gave best results.	0.98430129488125
Preoperative arthroscopy can determine the extent of different lesions after shoulder luxation which influence the outcome and is useful to select the optimal operation technique.	0.9938508967907385
Prenatal determination of fetal blood groups by DNA amplification today is possible for Rhesus D, eE, cC, Kell (K1/2), Duffy (Fya/b) and Kidd (Jka/b).	0.9915750904564653
Current assays using multiplex PCR and at least two specific primers as well as an intern control offer a diagnostic power of more than 99%.	1.00187301572712
In all pregnancies complicated by irregular blood group antibodies, blood group typing in amniotic fluid allows to reduce the number of invasive procedures.	0.8871087177299388
PCR typing is recommended in all cases with a heterozygous father and an increased antibody level or suspicious findings during ultrasound evaluation.	1.037249334120926
Adjuvant therapy with interferon for malignant melanoma causes neurotoxic side effects such as depression.	0.8299363209926628
The biochemical mechanisms are unknown.	0.5585878603222337
We report two cases with both depression and amnesia.	0.8497882217777469
In one case, attempted suicide was a companied by 7 h of amnesia.	0.7805712634619715
The diagnostic classification and possible explanations for the amnesia secondary to interferon therapy are reviewed.	0.857136075350144
Molecular and epidemiological studies have confirmed that human pathogenic papillomaviruses (HPV)types 16 and 18 are causally involved in the developement of carcinoma of the cervix.	0.9431035560623994
This statement is also true, albeit with reservations as yet, of other so-called high-risk HPV types, such as HPV 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56 and 58.	1.2188741337185858
Around 500,000 women throughout the world become ill with carcinoma of the cervix every year, and 1-4% of all younger women have a precancer of the cervix uteri.	1.33524281100944
This knowledge of the viral origin of anogenital neoplasms has not yet been exploited for primary and secondary prevention of these illnesses, however.	1.0670713927772957
This is mainly because infection with genital HPV types is very prevalent in young women but seldom leads to carcinoma.	0.8418970413555102
In this review, therefore, the most important epidemiological data available on cervical carcinoma and its preliminary stages are analysed with reference to an association with HPV.	1.0699611638721767
In addition, the molecular biological data on HPV as it relates to anogenital carcinogenesis are presented.	0.9118731778027493
In conclusion, the significance of HPV for the prevention of carcinoma of the cervix is discussed.	0.9748830878164594
We report the case of a 43-year-old woman who had a cardiogenic shock due to an acute inferior myocardial infarction.	1.0064213835167124
Her husband and a general practitioner living in the neighborhood initially performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation.	0.9115226947432435
A prehospital emergency physician found ventricular fibrillation when he arrived after 20 minutes.	0.7770825822878666
It was impossible to achieve stable rhythm by 42 attemps of defibrillation.	0.7567918282062143
Therefore, the patient was carried to our clinic under ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation.	1.2368365606691198
A cardiologist was informed with radio signal.	0.5499314452584823
Percutaneous cardiopulmonary support (pCPS) was implanted in the emergency department after 100 minutes of cardiac arrest.	1.1166317186102088
After stabilizing the hemodynamic situation by pCPS (4-5 l/min) it was possible to transfer the patient to the catheterization laboratory.	1.1252612149414338
Angiography revealed proximal occlusion of a dominant right coronary artery.	0.7641508252894353
After successful angioplasty it was possible to reestablish stable sinus rhythm by single defibrillation.	0.9553492128498342
By use of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) the flow rate of pCPS was reduced every two hours.	0.9850505844578588
After 10 hours of support pCPS was explaned.	0.710480083606591
IABP was needed for three days.	0.6184512084231477
The patient was discharged from hospital without any relevant neurological deficits after nine weeks.	0.9168692285269836
By using pCPS it is possible to stabilize the patient's hemodynamic situation and to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures if other means of resuscitation do not suffice.	1.1386539040946941
The use of pCPS in resuscitation is indicated in circulatory arrest if further therapeutic options seem promising.	0.8940451079044889
Defects of the frontoorbital complex subsequent to extensive tumor surgery or severe trauma often result in aesthetic and functional disharmonies.	0.8443066918195486
The long-term results of rehabilitation related to different materials and techniques are the subject of this study.	1.2615515713357714
From 1974 to 1996 altogether 127 patients with bony defects of the orbit and/or the skull base underwent surgery.	1.0987436109726945
All patients' data were documented prospectively from 1984 onwards.	0.8149648421434194
The results following reconstruction with autologous calvarian transplants in 52 patients were compared to those of a control group which received iliac bone or PMMA implants.	1.0256096145703024
Eighty-one bony defects (64%) resulted from tumor resection; 37 patients (29%) suffered from the effects of trauma.	1.111184084355414
In 67 cases (53%) reconstruction was performed primarily, in 51 cases (40%) secondarily.	1.2685546211422103
Free or pedicled soft-tissue transplants were necessary in order to separate the orbit and the neurocranium in 26% of the defects.	1.0605013100709504
On the other hand, small, isolated defects of the orbital roof (7%) were left without any reconstructive procedure.	1.2560700902701873
Contrary to the iliac bone grafts, the calvarian transplants resisted secondary resorption.	0.9125203548932
Postoperative infections appeared in two cases; loss of transplants was avoided entirely in the group of calvarian reconstructions in contrast to the alloplasts.	1.1031686004030778
The selection of a suitable donor site area and rigid fixation with microplates led to excellent esthetic results even in cases with large defects.	1.0124737889750377
Within inpatient psychotherapy traditionally different therapeutic approaches are combined.	0.8014458583611386
Usually verbal interventions of different orientations and settings (e.g.	0.5666467957958542
individual and group therapy), nonverbal procedures (e.g.	0.8508915620506794
music and art therapy) and bodyoriented techniques are included.	0.8564822314380298
The combinations is merely additive, integrated or eclectic.	0.7414323551546244
Little is known about the reciprocal interrelation of such combinations.	0.6859656760371928
Along the example of a definite additive combination of psychodynamic and behavioural psychotherapy for agoraphobias and obsessive disorders a rationale for the interrelationship of the different therapeutic components is discussed.	0.9412315636502426
We report an 18-year old woman with surgically proven primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) and normal intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) serum levels.	1.0734808433372467
The reason for this rare biochemical presentation are possible biologically active amino-terminal parathyroid hormone polypeptide fragments not detected by the widely used two-site immunoradiometric parathyroid hormone assay (PTH IRMA).	0.9525503060128323
Diagnosis and therapy of primary hyperparathyroidism therefore should not exclusively rest on the finding of hypercalcemia coupled with an elevated iPTH level.	1.031054014452067
Viral hepatitis belongs to the most important infectious diseases worldwide.	0.8529020141561768
More than 300 million chronic HBsAg carriers and chronic HCV carriers exist, respectively.	0.6669893706947879
High endemic areas of viral hepatitis are Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Near, Middle and Far East.	0.8372473187388426
Viral hepatitis is also very important in health care workers.	0.8841907465439408
Today viral hepatitis can be differentiated from type A to type E (G) based on immunological and molecular assays.	1.0247033422268703
While enterally transmitted hepatitis type A and type E only induce acute and rare fulminant disease, hepatitis type B, C and D often induce chronic progressive disease including liver cirrhosis with typical complications due to the portal hypertension and with a high rate of association with the development of primary liver cancer (HCC).	1.0682641801186306
This review focusses on viral hepatitis-related surgical problems, including liver transplantation.	0.9412712632460415
Hypertensive diseases in pregnancy (HDP) are one of the most frequent causes of maternal death and perinatal mortality.	1.0721383267474514
However, chronic hypertension without complications has a more favorable prognosis than preeclampsia.	1.3515879254773149
Apart from a familial predisposition, mutations of various genes may also be responsible; among these, APC resistance is of particular clinical significance.	1.0839789351950397
The insufficient endovascular invasion of trophoblast in the spiral aterioles is still considered to represent the pathogenetic basis of preeclampsia.	0.865085760618462
Increased lipid oxidation, deported membrane components of syncytiotrophoblasts, and increased invasion of fetal cells in the maternal circulation triggering immunological reactions are discussed as the causes.	1.0791580659014262
The result is an endothelial imbalance between vasoconstrictory-aggregating and vasodilatatory-antiaggregating compounds.	0.8180678740097476
The results of studies on the relevance of NO synthase are controversial.	0.9473936316008296
Currently, neither reliable methods for the early detection nor certain preventative measures to avoid the disease are available.	1.2500853036185144
Intensive care monitoring and therapy are essential for pregnant women with severe HDP.	1.0690392173899785
The obstetric procedure depends on the severity and dynamics of the disease as well as the state of development of the baby.	1.3962206069105587
When the pregnancy is continued defined guidelines for its termination for maternal or fetal indications must be taken into consideration.	0.7500933726610213
After delivery, the mother must be intensively monitored for at least 24 to 48 hours (postpartal eclampsia/HELLP syndrome).	0.8896888479396398
The risk for recurrence of the preeclampsia is between 20 and 26 % or when it occurred in the second trimester up to 65 % while that of HELLP syndrome is between 3.5 and 24 %.	1.2915085287323758
Acanthosis nigricans is a hyperkeratotic mucocutaneous eruption of heterogenous etiology which is characterized by hyperpigmentation, velvety cutaneous thickening, intensified skin markings and development of verrucous excrescences typically involving the intertriginous areas.	0.8157199326439512
Malignant acanthosis nigricans is most often associated with an abdominal adenocarcinoma frequently unresectable at the time of diagnosis.	1.0591309589610844
We report on the rare association of acanthosis nigricans with a transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder.	0.9489060243415876
Symptomatic treatment with topical calcipotriol significantly reduced the hyperkeratotic and papillomatous skin changes.	0.8202927172998556
The goal of this evaluation study is to analyze the effects of a new gerontopsychiatric institution, the gerontopsychiatric center (GC: a combination of a home-based outpatient service, a day-hospital and a consulting office for elderly with mental disorders) on the reorganization process of the treatment system from intramural toward extramural structures, as experts of the government of the FRG have been demanding for a long time.	1.2219421988166477
Based on data of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies two regional catchment areas - the city of Bielefeld (without GC, control region) and the district of Gütersloh (with GC) - are compared and analyzed, whether changes within the gerontopsychiatric system (subsystem A), the system of general medical treatment (subsystem B), or within the elderly care system (subsystem C) occurred.	1.3216982377572382
Concerning subsystem A the results are that the GC has a strong impact on the intended shift from intra- to extramural structures, without selecting patients by diagnosis nor by severity degrees of their mental disorders in extramural treatment facilities.	1.08573043944125
The home-based outpatient treatment is especially successful for elderly with a functional psychic disorder.	0.9157157403618804
These patients had the highest scores in improvement of psychiatric symptoms as well as in reduction of their self-care deficits within one year Effects of the GC on subsystem B were evident soon after its establishment, for example, by the increasing cooperation between the gerontopsychiatric health services and general hospitals in the region with GC, in which (hospitals) two fifths of all clinical gerontopsychiatric patients with a mental disorder as the main diagnosis (ICD-9) are treated.	1.3009597960794923
An effect of the GC on subsystem C is possibly the fact that in its region the rate of direct transfers of patients from the clinical gerontopsychiatric department into homes for the elderly is significantly lower than in the region without GC.	1.1046814389408324
In the field of psychoneuroimmunology it has become obvious that the immune system is governed by multiple influences from the central nervous system.	0.9240201115976495
One approach to verify these interactions can be seen in stress research.	0.9123375766431181
While the phenomenon of stress-induced changes in immunological processes is widely accepted, more recent studies focus on possible moderators and mechanisms of these responses.	0.9703069442325143
Within this research strategy it became evident that catecholamine increases upon stress are of a major importance for the frequently observed mild leukocytosis.	0.9622848821132403
The present study was conducted to investigate whether the often observed stress-induced increases in the number of peripheral lymphocyte subsets depends on the amount of epinephrine or norepinephrine release.	1.0734685805728421
Moreover, the question was addressed whether high or low catecholamine release is related to subjective ratings on discomfort.	0.9685128840458307
Using a "public speaking paradigm" we were able to replicate previous findings of high increases in the absolute number of CD8+ and CD56+ cells in peripheral blood.	0.9021383085945817
Moreover, when dividing subjects into high and low catecholamine responders, the amount of change was significantly larger in catecholamine responders irrespective of whether norepinephrine or epinephrine was used for grouping the subjects.	1.0618099915803156
However, high and low catecholamine responders did not differ with respect to subjective ratings on discomfort.	1.1696498370184996
The data are discussed with respect to underlying mechanisms in catecholamine-induced lymphocyte migration and possible reasons for the mismatch between objective and subjective indicators of stressor efficacy.	0.881408851678755
We report a locally recurrent retiform haemangioendothelioma (RHE) on the right great toe in a 40-year-old woman.	1.1582993889789472
There was a secondary soft tissue lesion on her right lower leg.	0.991584982647306
Histologically, primary lesion, local recurrence and the secondary soft tissue lesion (soft tissue metastasis?)	1.1632204635476011
Long, arborizing, neoplastic blood vessels were lined by CD31 and factor VIII-positive, monomorphic endothelial tumour cells; focally solid tumour areas, papillae and a prominent inflammatory infiltrate consisting of mature B and T lymphocytes were noted.	0.8446735440789035
The concept and the group of low-grade malignant vascular neoplasms is discussed, with special emphasis on inclusion of RHE in this category.	1.0894843889142407
HMSN is a hereditary symmetric ascending neuropathy of the peripherial nerves.	0.7597888270703604
Several cases of HMSN with motility disorders of both eyes have been reported in the literature.	0.7945593847600916
We describe a patient with HMSN type 1 and an incomplete peripherial 3rd nerve palsy of the right eye.	1.1096767194253252
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of developed unilateral oculomotor disorder in a patient with HMSN.	0.8259883996149524
A 34-year-old male (190 cm/100 kg) was scheduled for surgery of the nasal septum.	1.1879825294329591
He had had uneventful anaesthesia for appendicectomy 14 years earlier: following 600 mg thiopentone, 180 mg suxamethonium and up to 2 vol.% halothane for 20 min had been used and no symptoms of malignant hyperthermia (MH) were recorded.	0.9961293920669001
Following oral premedication with 2 mg flunitrazepam at 7.00 a.m. anaesthesia was induced with a priming dose of atracurium at 8.45 a.m. followed by 0.2 mg fentanyl, 500 mg thiopentone, and 100 mg suxamethonium.	1.0973139614360294
Endotracheal intubation was accomplished easily [9], and the patient was ventilated manually in a semi-closed circle system until spontaneous ventilation resumed.	0.9891674252257191
Enflurane (1.5% for 5 min, 1.0% for 10 min, and 0.8% until the diagnosis of MH was suspected) was given in 33% O2/66% N2O.	1.444827230393898
Seventy minutes after induction it was noted that the spontaneous respiratory rate and minute volume had risen continuously from 10/min and 6 l/min, respectively, to 20/min and 12 l/min.	1.084375080622077
Attempts at deepening anaesthesia with repeated doses of fentanyl up to a total dose of 0.95 mg failed to reduce the hyperventilation.	0.9404176185384955
In spite of a high fresh gas flow of 6 l/min and assisted manual ventilation, the FIO2 started to fall from 0.34 to 0.28 at 10:20 a.m.	1.0903245292963222
The O2/N2O ratio was changed to 1 : 1, but the FIO2 remained at 0.3.	1.2129317065716696
MH was suspected, enflurane was discontinued, and an arterial blood gas analysis was done (Table 2).	1.2035881096823757
When marked acidosis and hypercarbia were found, dantrolene 2.5 mg/kg was given, the operation was terminated, and the patient's trachea was extubated and he was monitored closely in the intensive care unit for 24 h. Vital signs were stable (Table 3) and no further complications were observed.	1.1695764678492782
The patient did not mention pain or uneasiness postoperatively.	0.6089652170897913
About 6 months later, a muscle biopsy was done according to the European MH Protocol [5] and the patient was found to be MHEh.	1.169748462857183
In this case five main reasons for the hypercarbia and mixed acidosis must be considered (Table 1).	0.9938405447359524
Firstly, hypoventilation does not seem to be reasonable as the patient was ventilated with 8 to 12 l/min, which is within the range of 80 - 120 mg/kg - min.	1.3436707497910318
Secondly, we can exclude shock and hypoperfusion because the patient had a normal blood pressure and heart rate (within 65 - 90 beats/min), his fingertips and skin were well perfused, his body temperature was 37  °C, and there was no sign of muscle rigidity.	1.1845801855676787
Thirdly, a defect of the CO2 adsorber as well as CO2 admixture to the N2O and O2 ventilation gases can cause hypercarbia.	0.999520348359392
We use two absorbers in sequence of which one is changed every day, and found neither a change in colour of the indicator nor an abnormally raised temperature of the absorbers [11].	0.9394497492815793
A postoperative check of the ventilator showed no defect in the O2/N2O supply and a correctly functioning anaesthesia apparatus.	0.8927223305264843
A malfunction of both CO2 absorbers resulting in intraoperative hypercarbia could not explain a postoperative mixed acidosis lasting for more than 6 h. Anaesthesias performed at the same time using soda lime from the same canisters were totally uneventful.	1.047818419128114
It is concluded that the hypercarbia and mixed acidosis were caused by hypermetabolism.	0.7533539158919151
A thorough postoperative examination by an internist did not reveal any thyroid, pulmonary, endocrine, or circulatory reason for our intra- and postoperative findings.	1.1861587987757043
Iatrogenic factors like superficial anaesthesia or systemic side effects of adrenaline admixture to local anaesthetics can cause hypermetabolism without striking clinical signs, but they do not cause mixed acidosis lasting longer than 6 h (Table 2).	0.9699362742111203
The most suitable explanation in this case is an abortive form of MH.	1.1517793391841984
Introduction: Avoidance of extracorporeal circulation during beating heart surgery (OP CAB = Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery) for aortocoronary bypass grafting (ACBG) is gaining increasing importance in modern cardiac surgery.	1.211533386395995
With the development of new mechanical stabilization devices, the revascularization of the posterior wall of the heart and the distal rith coronary artery became feasable.	1.0300731076132872
Especially high-risk patients with multiple risk factors for open heart surgery will profit from this approach, because the negative effects of the extracorporeal circulation are avoided.	1.2348418610266116
Although dementia is described as one of the constituent characteristics of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), alongside gait disturbances and urinary incontinence, there is a rather limited number of controlled studies concerning neuropsychological deficits in the disease.	1.1282472888744959
A wide range of psychopathologically relevant symptoms have been described, but the common features of most cases include mental and motor slowing, apathy, emotional indifference, anosognosia, memory and attentional impairment.	1.0766994582049194
A number of other functional deficits such as dyslexia, dysgraphia, acalculia, apraxia can also frequently be found.	0.8479342600864185
Some emphasis is put on the work of J. de Mol (Brussels) which appears to be most important for the study of neuropsychological symptoms in NPH patients.	1.0280508518288398
The methodological standard of a number of studies has been found to be rather low, and yet a sound neuropsychological investigation may be of utmost importance for the diagnosis and neurosurgical outcome assessment.	1.2037663304618884
Concerning morphological correlates of the functional deficits in NPH, various hypotheses have been formulated, but it is argued that symptoms can neither be described as predominantly "diffuse" in nature, nor can they be reduced to unilocular dysfunctions.	1.1618592268538765
Recommendations for future research strategies are formulated.	0.7161087840949213
Up to now there are no published results of therapy of paraphilia (Pedophilia, Sadism) and sexual aggressive impulsiveness with LHRH-(luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone) Agonists in the Germanspeaking countries.	1.095753606253554
In this report we describe 11 patients which were treated with the LHRH-Agonist Leuprolide Acetate in a period of 12 months.	1.0499801257383974
The patients showed no tendency of sexuell aggressive behaviour and reported an evident reduction of penile erection, ejaculation, masturbation, sexual deviant impulsiveness and phantasies.	0.9171778126941209
One patient died from suicide.	0.9890185122483174
In combination with other treatments LHRH-Agonist seem to be a very promising alternative to cyproterone acetate and its possible carcinogene effects.	1.034222529951761
Aim of the study: To investigate the long-term effect of TNFR55-IgG1 in patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis refractory to multiple previous DMARD treatments.	1.0651562445326594
Methods: Between 1994 and 1995 we recruited 80 patients for two double blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trials.	1.0873260675727487
All patients were treated for 2-30 months with a glycosylated fused protein consisting of two human p55 TNF receptors linked to a human IgG1-Fc.	1.0322686994963535
The dose range was 2.5-100mg/month given i.v.	0.9202186824222444
with cumulative doses from 40-940mg.	0.6705576329048425
All patients were followed-up prospectively for 24-36 months after initiation of therapy.	1.0073190777612095
The evaluations included a 48 swollen and tender joint count, ESR, CRP, RF, ANA, ENA, and safety parameters at 6 month intervals.	0.8143904293382958
In addition, pharmacokinetics, TNF, and anti-TNFR55-IgG1 antibody levels were available after the first and third injection.	1.0516872390645202
Results: Data from 80 patients are available representing an experience of more than 170 patient years;  11 patients are still being treated.	1.2679796305744269
Predominant reasons for treatment withdrawal were restrictions in treatment protocol.	0.7814427412510583
Six patients died  (1 during treatment, 5 in the post-treatment follow-up).	1.331629636421894
All deaths were related to preexisting cardiovascular disease except one post-surgery septic arthritis 6 months after the last dosing (during vacation in another country).	0.9315663081106496
Anti-TNFR55-IgG1 antibodies correlated with a decrease in drug half-time.	0.6911932827886763
Shifts in the TNFR55-IgG1 glycosylation pattern affected pharmacokinetics and efficacy.	0.6967302297563774
A lupus nephritis occurred 18 months after the last dosing in one patient with erosive RA (ANA and dsDNS positive already before TNFR55-IgG1 initiation).	0.9161830239735587
Continued treatment for 3 years in 11 patients resulted in an 81% reduction in swollen joint count, less morning stiffness, less pain, and a reduction in steroids.	1.2346379813300017
Conclusion: Treatment with TNFR55-IgG1 is safe and efficacious over the long-term in patients with severe refractory RA.	1.14016390719189
For both VFR and as IFR flight, visual assessment is the major source of information for the pilot.	1.006407123708777
The new possibilities for change of refraction by means of corneal refractive surgery have led to an increasing demand from pilots for these new methods.	0.9521297991737204
Can these methods successfully be applied for aviation purposes?	0.7840193372638324
The valid regulations for medical standards of pilots, as well as the future international regulations such as JAR and ICAO, are explained in this respect.	1.053760723831019
A report is given on the work of the Advisory Board of the German Federal Government Air Traffic Authority and on the cases treated so far and their outcome, and recommendations are expressed.	1.0961200185142908
Concerning the legal situation and clinical experience, advice for pilots, aviation medical examiners and ophthalmologists is given.	0.7793306558741645
Persistent remnants of the caudal müllerian ducts can manifest in several forms and are often associated with other urogenital disorders, especially hypospadias.	1.033514125306843
Inadequate activity of the müllerian inhibiting factor, in addition to fetal testosterone deficiency, is responsible for this syndrome.	1.1106064982729245
The etiology, diagnosis and management of müllerian duct remnants are discussed.	0.7850111400332089
A complex case of penile-scrotal hypospadia, hypoplastic prostate gland, testicular ectopia and retrovesical cyst is presented.	0.775471184922298
The official German guidelines for prevention of nosocomial pneumonia were published by the Bundesgesundheitsamt, now called Robert-Koch-Institut, twelve years ago.	0.6895470322781384
The recently published official "guidelines for prevention of nosocomial pneumonia" of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are categorized according to scientific evidence.	0.6625400416433402
The American guidelines are very detailed and differ in some aspects from the official German guidelines.	0.5631740160273515
The purpose of the present paper is to inform the German anaesthesiologist about the official CDC guidelines and to provide a renewed background for the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia.	0.9110920328931436
At present, the importation into Germany of life-threatening and highly contagious diseases such as pneumonic plague and Ebola is unlikely, but cannot be ruled out.	0.9000586276773199
In spite of the extreme rarity of these diseases, guidelines are necessary to prevent the spread of these agents in case of their importation.	1.1457402080902919
In Germany, marked regional differences exist with respect to the development of emergency regulations and the availability of specialized centers for diagnostics and therapy.	0.9957917841965932
A federal framework is missing.	0.4992897839232073
A concept is presented here in which the capacity to respond is substantially augmented with limited additional cost through inter-regional cooperation using existing infrastructure and federally standardized procedures.	0.8856719861724666
The therapeutic effect and the side effects of fumaric acid derivatives used in treatment of psoriasis vulgaris have been subjects of controversy for more than 30 years.	1.0750900175599223
A total of 83 patients with severe psoriasis vulgaris were investigated in as ingle-centre, long-term open (12 months) clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of the fumaric acid ester preparations Fumaderm initial and Fumaderm.	1.133470356572032
The antipsoriatic effect of the fumaric acid derivatives was clear, with a mean reduction of 76% in PASI.	1.2133790329842793
Adverse events in were noted in 62% of the patients (mainly flushing and gastrointestinal complaints).	0.9423390087773842
These were dose-dependent and decreased in frequency in the course of the study.	1.1460181274310037
No severe adverse events occurred.	0.555649746301062
We believe that of fumaric acid derivatives are indicated in cases of severe therapy-resistant psoriasis to and can be used even for long-term application.	1.0433647751690733
Background: Because retinal necrosis syndrome seldom occurs, we present our results of silicone oil tamponade for associated retinal detachment.	1.383262410861301
The eyelids are the site of many different pathological conditions.	0.9364030041426195
Swelling - often oedematous - is a frequent symptom.	1.5575591555272468
This publication deals with the pathophysiological and anatomical basis of eyelid swelling and mainly provides a practical approach for differential diagnosis with the help of flow and short characterisations of possible causes.	0.9945825990575734
The subjective complaints of the patient charts (pain, pruritus) are shown to be important criteria for orientation.	1.271804556756645
Special interest is focussed on allergic diseases and atrophic conditions as causes of eyelid swelling.	0.7362217165157154
A 74-year-old man suffered from symptoms of a left upper lobe pneumonia.	1.101700079433465
Additional retrosternal masses were proved.	0.45717499875674394
Progression in the left upper lobe occurred in spite of antibiotic therapy; infiltrations of the right lower lobe were seen.	1.126176423649583
No germs could be identified.	0.5019157561305375
Bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy showed no pathological findings.	0.560103912937593
His general health became worse, and the patient died under the clinical diagnosis of "wandering pneumonia" with finally suspicion of fulminant pulmonary artery embolism.	1.2465673083325366
Autopsy findings revealed an advanced stage of pulmonary artery sarcoma with myocardial infiltration and metastases in both kidneys and thyroid gland.	0.9113787660892414
General manifestation of pulmonary artery sarcoma usually are symptoms similar to those caused by pulmonary artery embolism with obstruction of pulmonary arterial flow.	0.9845039491188602
The unusual constellation of clinical findings similar to colliquating pneumonia results in secondary infection due to tumorous pulmonary infarction.	0.7938912725014309
The difficulties in diagnosis by biopsy are caused by primary intravascular growth of the neoplasms.	0.9728216749464149
Therefore early diagnosis in an operable tumor stage by means of CT, MR, and angiography is very important.	1.129691209893659
Definition of the problem: Is it the brain that makes a human being a person?	0.898737529579861
This anthropological question has been raised because of the findings of modern human brain research, and there are severe ethical consequences anew: If the appropriate anthropological answer is yes, then all invasive research would be problematic, because one would touch the basis of human essence.	1.195610178279244
The problem is that the two major philosophical paradigms that offer an answer to the anthropological question, dualism and monism, have opposing concepts.	1.0510010734880082
Arguments: This paper argues that the error of these two paradigms is that they understand the human body and the human mind as 'res' - as things.	1.3010409745691451
The explanation of the human being as an interactive unit of body and mind is impossible in both paradigms.	0.9939221330365207
A third anthropological view that tries to make that understandable is the anthropology of the Hebrew Bible.	0.7503917649490213
It does assume the category 'thing' while speaking about humans, it presumes the category 'aspect'.	0.9082725869087604
There is no Hebrew word for 'mind' in contrast to 'body' or vice versa.	0.9576276223687491
The biblical language only knows terms for the unity of human beings seen under a certain aspect.	0.8535337569112852
Conclusion: Here, the body and thus the brain are important and necessary condition for human essence, but this is not a sufficient explanation for the human personality.	1.3595069998783857
Invasive research on the human brain is here neither generally forbidden nor tolerated - one has to demonstrate in every single case whether the planned operation touches regions that are crucial for the personality of the human subject.	1.1135423221740324
Introduction: In recent studies we identified two morphological phenomena in the facial nucleus of the brainstem that play an important role in the recovery of facial movement: hyperinnervation and misdirected reinnervation.	1.1022124056911495
While the hyperinnervation could easily be quantified by cell counting, the extent of misdirected reinnervation could not be estimated accurately.	0.8987252758437626
In the present study we developed a method for accurate quantification of this misdirected reinnervation.	1.0838099030384647
A 50 year old female patient received anaesthesia of the arm by the vertical infraclavicular blockade of the plexus brachialis (VIP).	1.0423778205970162
Postoperatively an ipsilateral pneumothorax occured complicated by pleural effusion and a contralateral bronchopneumonia, which resolved completely after treatment.	0.9458475867935551
The blockade of the plexus was performed correctly, failures in determining the correct point of needle insertion could be excluded.	0.9276642356253623
Therefore a pneumothorax has to be regarded as a specific complication of the VIP, which might occur despite correct technique, and requires that the patient be informed of this eventuality.	1.1864043099542447
Nevertheless, the VIP is an important method due to its high success rate concerning blockade of the musculocutaneous nerve and tolerance of tourniquet.	1.1231806874228132
The risk of a pneumothorax is about 0.2 to 0.7%.	1.0935477891724399
The routine application of ultrasound in pregnancy has had an important impact on perinatal medicine.	0.9179761294690086
New trends in perinatal medicine, aiming at more individual and self-determined pregnancy and delivery, are realizable because of the safety provided by ultrasound.	0.9282260090215566
Often prenatal ultrasound is regarded as only being able to detect fetal malformations, but ultrasound provides many more benefits for a safe pregnancy: early detection of fetal viability; intrauterine localization of the pregnancy; exact determination of the gestational age in early pregnancy; later in pregnancy, confirmation of appropriate fetal growth, position and localization of placenta site.	1.016969769057472
In addition, the development of close mother-child bonding by visualizing the fetus could be of positive impact.	0.9218105084742411
These aspects are contributions of ultrasound to a gentle and safe pregnancy and delivery for mother and child.	0.9124169032643387
For routine evaluation of ureteropelvic junction obstruction in children, sonography, voiding cystogram, IV pyelogram and a renal scan in combination with administration of furosemide are available.	0.9419103395474027
Furthermore, often preoperative antegrade or retrograde ureteropyelography is performed.	1.2364832137575348
However, the significance of retrograde ureteropyelography in the world literature remains controversial.	1.0188438452718847
Therefore, we reviewed the records of 41 children who underwent a pyeloplasty in our department.	1.2134968591479542
In 9 children the ureter was visualized by IV pyelogram, voiding cystogram or antegrade ureteropyelography; a retrograde examination of the ureter was performed in 21 children before pyeloplasty in the OR.	0.9637310827572816
In 11 children the ureter was not visualized preoperatively.	0.5513230357379463
Retrograde ureterography neither gave additional information in any patient nor did it change the operative technique.	0.9516876364142047
In the children where the ureter was not visualized preoperatively, no ureteric abnormality was found in association with ureteropelvic junction obstruction.	0.9332653905243182
Hence, we conclude that retrograde ureteropyelography before pyeloplasty in children is not necessary, provided that sonography does not show ureteral dilatation.	1.1856218463344939
We report on a patient with multicentric juvenile xanthogranuloma, whose unusual clinical and histological pattern initially obscured the diagnosis.	1.019370619204248
Spontaneous remission of the tumour, which has now been maintained for over 2 years, the change from the primary monomorphological fibrocytic appearance to a polymorphological histiocytic picture with multiple fat-storing giant cells, and the lacking demonstration of specific cell organelles finally allowed the nature of the disease to the definitely diagnosed.	1.1747530344544803
In children with horseshoe kidneys Wilms' tumors can be observed 2 to 8-times more often.	0.9990914411401841
Wilms' tumors are malignant mixed tissue tumors that seldom show large parts of fatty tissue.	0.8040969291420383
We report about a 28-month-old girl with an unusual Wilms' tumor in a horseshoe kidney which according to radiological criteria could have been a teratoma because of its large lipomatous part with internal calcifications.	1.0672736701674472
The radiological characteristics of these differential diagnoses are presented in different cross-section imagings.	0.9683438400300725
Both differential diagnostic considerations correlated with the histologic diagnosis of a teratoid Wilms'tumor.	1.0084124896477884
Gene therapy in orthopedic surgery is a new technic based on the idea of biological tissue healing.	1.0401506817444748
External gene segments are transferred to cells that overexpress growth factors locally to achieve this effect.	0.8865831729022742
The influence of growth factors on fracture healing is very well documented in the literature.	0.9788816524574374
Experimental data demonstrate that defect healing in bone can be accelerated by the application of different cytokines in vivo.	0.8805499739363201
Gene transfer is a promising, new technic of in situ tissue engineering that will enter clinics within the next decade.	1.1040535694106446
Biomechanical investigations of the mandible are difficult to perform due to a variety of conditions involved.	0.9959636063597063
For the appropriate reconstruction of biomechanical properties, a geometrically correct body model has to be established which fits to complex in vivo conditions.	1.0803792966033903
The aim of our study was to evaluate the use of finite-element models (FEM) for the assessment of mandibular deformation under mechanical loading.	0.9263227755271941
Explanted human mandibles (n = 5) were investigated by strain gauges to determine the individual strain distribution under mechanical loading.	1.1211314109105688
FEM analysis based on a computed tomograph (CT) was performed and the results were matched with the test data.	1.1913452961964235
Our study demonstrates only minor interindividual differences in the strain distribution for each load studied.	0.8683684059964708
The mechanical response in terms of deformation was found to depend mainly on gross geometrical properties and to a minor extent on the various other variables.	1.045390122995342
At all positions the maximum principal strain was tensile, the minimum principal strain was compressive, and the absolute strain values were correlated with the magnitude of the applied force.	1.1199294517014384
CT-based FEM analysis revealed the utility of mathematical models to approximate simulated data our experimental results.	0.8302714517293611
Hence, FEM analysis is a non-invasive tool in the prediction of biomechanical behaviour of individual mandibles and therefore may help in trauma reconstruction and treatment planning.	1.051434042279973
Acrodysostosis is a rare syndrome characterized by growth retardation and peripheral dysostosis.	1.035344715580925
70% of affected patients exhibit mental retardation.	1.0870454755866235
Inheritance occurs in an autosomal-dominant pattern.	0.7379554912117724
The genetic defect is not known.	0.782086754149916
Therapeutic strategies in the treatment of pancreatic carcinoma are based on the high number of non-resectable cancers, the high relative radioresistance and the high distant metastases rate.	1.1097035949232004
Even in curatively resected carcinomas, a locally effective treatment modality is needed because of the risk of microscopical residual disease in the peripancreatic tissue.	0.8646136605743253
The efficacy of radiotherapy is dose dependent.	0.6964894593455865
Based on an analysis of published data a dose of more than 50 Gy is recommended, resulting in a high morbidity rate with external beam radiotherapy alone.	1.0712147034184911
The use of intraoperative radiotherapy allows locally restricted dose escalation without increased perioperative morbidity.	0.8608434667068624
In adjuvant and in primary treatment, local tumor contol was improved (70-90 %).	1.0116964828102943
With palliative intent, pain relief was obtained rapidly in over 60 % of patients and led to improved patient performance.	1.2593600159616196
As a result of the high distant metastases rate, even in curatively resected carcinomas, the overall prognosis could not be significantly improved.	1.143914237990675
Further dose escalation is limited by the increasing incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (20-30 %).	0.8514459295469153
Malignant tumors of the head and neck region are amongst the six most often occurring tumors of the body.	0.9257952040418207
They can be associated with the different anatomical compartments as well as different histologic types.	1.0954589119194709
The way of tumor spread of these malignancies depends on their histologic type and on the region.	1.006779388392328
These compartments can be separated into the nasopharynx, the oropharynx, and the hypopharynx.	1.2832247690198675
Most of the malignant tumors belong to the squamous cell carcinomas, other histologic types are depicted less frequently.	1.0065394015120734
The histologic types of the other groups which are seen more often comprise of lymphomas and adenoidcystic carcinomas.	1.020101693417075
The undifferentiated carcinoma of the nasopharynx is supposed to be a special type of tumor.	1.0804863105049334
The malignant tumors of the pharynx can also involve all three compartments.	0.9061468869118718
Beside these tumors, malignancies of mesenchymal origin can also be delineated.	0.7377210316983682
While there are quite a number of reports on vascular injuries complicating hip arthropasty by acetabular component screw fixation, retractor tip pressure or extruding bone cement, the incidence of deep femoral vessel injuries in operative fixation of proximal femoral fractures is comparatively seldom described.	0.9883364391891158
We report on two patients with per- and subtrochanteric femoral fractures who sustained injuries of deep femoral artery branches during the implantation of a dynamic hip screw (DHS) and a dynamic condylar screw (DCS), which resulted in a massive thigh hematoma and a fist-size pseudoaneurysm respectively and necessitated surgical intervention in either case.	1.120865778763633
We blame these vascular injuries on the pressure of Hohmann retractors exposing the femoral bone or on the drilling of boreholes for plate attachement.	0.8703888477878294
After discussing various operative procedures, we conclude that intramedullar implants are safer than plates with regard to potential vascular complications.	1.0143853593405148
Cleft lip and palates (CLP) are caused by a variety of factors.	0.8335396342600927
Ionizing radiation is only one of these factors.	1.0903026952549093
The meltdown of the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl on April 26, 1986, and the subsequent radioactive fallout did not cause any acute radiation sickness in Germany.	1.0480758803925123
Nevertheless, in West Berlin a significant increase of trisomy-21 cases was reported in births 9 months after the Chernobyl reactor accident.	1.1292122421079158
In our study we analyzed the influence of the radioactive fallout after the Chernobyl disaster on the rate and regional distribution of CLP newborns in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR).	1.0762587093968168
In contrast to the Federal Republic of Germany an ongoing malformation register for CLP newborns had existed in the former GDR since 4 July 1967.	0.9991338123686153
Environmental data were collected from national and international environmental authorities and atomic energy agencies.	0.8403136214634114
Population statistics were taken from the statistical yearbook of the former GDR.	0.8077007743858535
During a 10-year period from 1980 to 1989, the average number of CLP newborns in the GDR was 1.88 per 1,000 live births.	1.1816920817865142
A significant prevalence increase was recorded in 1983, 1987 und 1988.	0.874011266058308
In comparison to the mean rate in the period from 1980 until 1986, 1987 demonstrated an increase of 9.4%.	1.1114011580667555
Regional prevalence increases were seen in the three northern districts of Schwerin, Rostock and Neubrandenburg, where the radioactivity measurements in general showed higher levels of the radionuclides caesium-137 und strontium-90 than in other districts.	0.9789473236939151
Owing to the comprehensive malformation register for CLP patients in the GDR, this is the first study for Germany, analyzing the CLP rate before and after the fallout in Chernobyl.	1.1148862744293297
The results support the allegation of the influence of radiation-induced increase of CLP newborns after the Chernobyl reactor accident.	0.816415994293089
The median survival time for patients with disseminated malignant melanoma is 5-7 months; it is still not really known whether therapeutic measures prolong survival.	1.1945618096421007
The aim of the present investigation was to identify patients with prolonged survival in stage IV disease and to analyse the possible impact of therapy on the course of the disease.	1.0710544570128575
in the Department of Dermatology, Benjamin Franklin University Medical Centre at the Free University of Berlin, 263 patients with were diagnosed as having stage IV melanoma and enrolled in a computer-based registry between 1970 and 1993.	0.8586436278090703
In 89 cases systemic medical mentous treatment was given and 111 patients underwent surgery and/or radiation therapy.	0.8652082667747232
There were 48 patients who received both systemic and local therapy.	0.9093216507804257
On the other hand, 111 patients received no treatment.	0.6767410920945954
Twenty two patients were identified survived longer than 24 months (median survival time 33 months).	1.122477148013441
None of the patients who had received no treatment survived for 2 years or longer.	1.2725150850088094
The 22 patients with prolonged survival were treated by multimodality included 16 who had received both systemic treatment and surgery and/or radiation, while 3 had had only systemic drug therapy and another 3, only local treatment.	1.175781639264756
Twelve of the 22 patients became tumour free after their initial surgery or radiation.	0.9303249527848992
Active therapy in disseminated melanoma with reduction of tumour mass by surgery and radiation and with systemic medical treatment may lead to prolonged survival in a considerable percentage of patients.	1.0234666166345545
Background: The use of intravenous heparin is essential for the treatment of unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction.	1.1499786020138787
A significant rebound of thrombin generation within 6 to 10 hours after termination of heparin infusion has been reported.	0.9115881756705069
This time window is clinically critical as the incidence of recurrent ischemia peaks in this period.	0.8802733379641247
It has therefore been recommended to gradually taper heparin infusion continously rather than to discontinue it abruptly.	0.8704460653721777
However, it is not known which dosing procedure is useful and whether it definitly reduces thrombin rebound.	1.1804431168227094
The use of porcine skin as a biomedical model for the human integument is discussed with reference to the literature.	1.008910197806441
The epidermis and dermis can be used as a model as there are clear structural, functional and biochemical similarities with human skin layers.	1.0468287234827487
The actual utilization of porcine skin in dermatological research is reviewed.	0.7744460887657642
Practical difficulties are emphasized: in particular, the conditions required for use of porcine skin in experimental research, the most suitable breeds, and restrictions on biological interpretation of the results.	1.2384033493839748
Laparoscopic procedures have attained increasing importance in the diagnosis and therapy of carcinoma of the cervix in recent years (Table 1) [34].	1.2830152866699234
Laparoscopic pelvic and para-aortal lymphadenectomies are therefore performed to assess the operability of carcinoma of the cervix and for its staging.	0.9837053825760701
In the case of primarily operable tumours, paraortal and pelvic lymphadenectomy is carried out by a laparoscopic procedure, and when the lymph nodes are negative nodes and there is no intra-abdominal metastasis the lymphadenectomy is combined with laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy.	1.0785860034440085
If laparoscopy discloses positive lymph nodes, debulking can be carried out and the patient can be referred for radiotherapy.	0.9749881300022302
In addition, laparoscopic procedures, even in combination with radical cervicectomy for early invasive carcinoma of the cervix, can mean conservation of the patient's fertility.	1.2580615264521668
In the case of primarily inoperable tumours laparoscopy can be used to assess the lymph node status and the intra-abdominal tumour spread and to classify the patient's condition as potentially secondarily operable or inoperable.	1.1705454479425308
In addition, in the case of primarily undertreated patients whose carcinoma of the cervix has been diagnosed incidentally in preparations of tissue examined following hysterectomy, posttreatment in the form of laparoscopic lymphadenectomy and laparoscopically assisted colpectomy can be performed.	1.081523804505836
The efficacy of buprenorphine in opioid dependent patients (n=20) was compared to methadone maintained subjects (n=20) in a randomized comparison trial.	1.1844891139443736
Sublingual application of buprenorphine as an alternative synthetical opioid is being compared to methadone during a 24 week study period.	0.9799700966797114
A trend (p=0.06) could be found in the retention rate of investigated patients being maintained on a mean dosage of 63 mg oral applicable methadone (racemat of L- and D-methadone) in comparison to the group on a mean dosage of 7,3 mg buprenorphine (sublingual tablets).	1.046826229475751
The dropout-rate of 11 subjects at the end of the study in the buprenorphine group was higher when compared to the dropout-rate of 5 in the methadone group.	1.015504788043965
There was no significant difference between the two groups over the treatment period in respect to additional consumption of opiates, benzodiazepines and cocaine as evaluated through urine toxicology.	0.9389674265296675
The result in regard to compliance over the study period demonstrates that methadone appears to be the more successful oral opioid (p=0,04).	1.1612697323917833
Nevertheless, efficacy of buprenorphine in maintenance could be demonstrated in the remaining subjects, and further studies with higher daily doses and a higher number of subjects have to be performed.	1.3276693991397834
In patients with pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma, surgery is a technically difficult procedure.	0.9938183827390017
Whereas those rare forms of localized pleural mesotheliomy are being detected incidentally and can be cured by complete resection, most patients with diffuse malignant mesothelioma present with an advanced stage of disease.	0.9915295648571765
Most of these patients survive less than 12 months irrespective of the treatment modality.	1.2278643898616657
For diffuse pleural mesothelioma, some favorable prognostic factors were identified: IMIG (International Mesothelioma Interest Group), stages I and II, epithelial type, age under 50, female gender.	1.0914125721751644
In IMIG stages I and II, extended pleuropneumonectomy followed by chemo- and/or radiotherapy is recommended.	0.8122977673959259
For this subset of patients, a median survival time of between 20 and 30 months is reported.	1.0512926661636421
Pleurectomy and decortication are recommended as palliative surgical strategies against pleural effusion.	0.8064291409822855
In patients with technically inoperable infiltration of the thoracic wall, irradiation is helpful; sometimes partial remission and relief of pain can be achieved by chemotherapy.	0.9657696412729442
Fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG) registers the magnetic field generated by the fetal heart.	0.7945127795116772
In contrast to the fetal elctrocardiogram, fECG permits non-invasive registration of fetal heart activity and documentation of all parts of the PQRST-wave-forms from the second trimenon onwards.	1.0602615986493733
This facilitates the determination of cardiac time intervals and establishment of reference values for different stages of pregnancy.	0.9167764230480104
We examined 53 women in 104 recordings from the 10th week of gestation onwards (1 to 10 recordings per individual).	1.000652791173547
The fMCG (37 magnetic channels, sampling rate 1024 Hz, bandwidth 1-200Hz) was recorded non-invasively over the mother's abdomen in a magnetically shielded room.	0.9875176702934035
Registration of fetal heart beats was generally successful from the 20/21th week of gestation onwards.	0.886556255096647
In a few cases, fetal heart beats could be registered as early as in the 16th week.	1.093724312991744
Cardiac time intervals and amplitudes of fMCG increased concordantly with fetal growth.	0.6667835581381791
Mean P wave duration increased from 31 to 49 ms (p < 0.05), PQ interval from 95 to 107 ms (n. s.) and QRS duration from 36 to 52 ms (p < 0.01).	0.8832955057030649
The mean amplitudes of the P and R waves also increased.	0.7738984721336455
To demonstrate imaging findings in inflammatory diseases of the pharynx and possible complications.	0.9400116370987276
The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyse the complications of our arthroscopic procedures at the ankle joint.	1.1134098133818109
In all patients we evaluated the treatment protocols and in 111 patients (79,3%) we also evaluated the clinical and radiologic results.	1.3310023022490836
All in all we have found complications in 14 patients.	0.8323187401861976
In 4 cases we have seen a delayed wound healing, in 2 cases a superficial infection, in 3 cases a deep infection, in 3 cases a neural damage and in 2 cases a phlebothrombosis.	1.2972790831848136
Our study show, that the complication rate could be minimized by detailed knowledge of the anatomy, exact preoperative diagnostic and planing of the operation and careful preparation of the portals.	1.1733819643174512
The use of a laser also shows a tendency to a lower complication rate.	1.0752280598652688
Airbag inflation is associated with a loud noise.	0.7471887536048631
This very short noise has a peak amplitude of 170 dB sound pressure level and can make otologic injuries.	0.8662738382591131
We report a case of acoustic trauma after airbag inflation.	0.8245331097914229
The 24-year-old man has hearing loss both side in the 3000- to 6000-Hz range and in the deep-frequency.	1.1570824626369491
The possibility of acoustic trauma from airbag noise are probably much more common and need more attention in the clinic.	0.9130292923420305
The incidence of primary malignant neoplasms of the pleura, the pericardium and the peritoneum in Germany has been rising since about the mid-1980 s. A continuing rise is expected until about 2020, predominantly due to the peak of asbestos processing in Germany between 1965 and 1980.	1.1147987228280982
About 90 % of the mesotheliomas stored in the files of the German Mesothelioma Registry in Bochum are asbestos related and therefore possibly due to occupational exposure that may be compensated by the professional associations.	1.064479860949104
More than 500 mesotheliomas annually can be diagnosed in the German Mesothelioma Registry.	1.1035007220963988
In this first part of the series on mesotheliomas, current concepts on etiology and pathogenesis as well as diagnostic procedures and standards are discussed.	1.0796255993090549
At the present, specific chromosomal or genetic defects that constantly give rise to a mesothelioma are not known.	1.008638764699915
The initiation and progression of malignant mesotheliomas is a highly complex mechanism that is based on individual genetic alterations.	0.9716101410247155
A reliable diagnosis is the basis for therapeutic, prognostic and medicolegal conseques; in general, it can be achieved by thoracoscopic inspection with selected biopsy.	1.1957309674160974
Surgery may gain a more important role in the therapy of malignant tumors of serosal membranes not only in palliative, but also in potential curative approaches if the diagnosis can be made at earlier tumor stages.	1.2124104287538013
Acute gastrointestinal bleeding is a life threatening disease with a mortality rate of 10%.	1.1491841162150316
Upper gastrointestinal bleeding occurs more frequent (85%) and more severe compared to lower gastrointestinal bleeding.	1.0942114381437178
The medical history may be helpful in the diagnosis of the bleeding source.	1.180756199743825
Prognosis and mortality are dependent on intensity of bleeding, reflected by clinical signs such as shock, hemoglobin level, transfused blood units, hematemesis, presence of comorbidity and age of the patient.	0.9413939590223177
Furthermore rebleeding is associated with an increased mortality.	1.0315015990730514
Therefore one major goal in the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding is to avoid rebleeding.	0.9618512938986459
Joints are innervated by nociceptive nerve fibres (nociceptors), which are only activated by tissue-damaging stimuli.	1.1184379629523058
This activation causes pain in conscious humans.	0.6445127937744735
The sensory terminals of many nociceptors in the tissue are sensitized by inflammatory processes.	0.8582094930216854
Under these conditions, normally innocuous and non-painful stimuli are sufficient to activate nociceptors and to elicit pain.	0.8138769802504726
The effect of inflammatory mediators such as bradykinin and prostaglandins is important for the process of sensitization.	0.8214104546199004
In addition to their sensory function, many nociceptors have an efferent function.	1.1125828778542952
They evoke a neurogenic inflammation by the release of neuropeptides such as substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide into the tissue.	0.8070155640223278
The efferent function of nociceptors contributes to the generation of inflammatory lesions of the tissue.	0.7748694375196885
Autolyzed, antigen-extracted, allogeneic bone (AAA bone) is prepared from cortical bones of human organ donors.	0.8272372617244366
AAA bone possesses osteoinductive properties as it delivers BMPs from its bone matrix.	0.6929215851247631
Within a prospective study, 37 cranial defects were reconstructed using AAA bone implants over a period of more than 7 years.	1.0326392088542118
The patients were followed-up at standardized intervals.	0.9617474492640771
Roentgenographic assessments and bone scintigraphies revealed osseous integration and remodelling of the AAA bone implants.	0.7411982231973282
In one quarter of the cases re-entry was performed 10 to 18 months after the cranioplasty (removal of osteosynthesis material, recurrence of tumor).	1.0274287825455461
All nine AAA bone reconstructions showed bleeding surfaces and bony integrations.	0.6864083774947537
A bone biopsy was taken from the center of one of these AAA bone implants and this showed new bone formation originating from the surface of the implant.	1.0463185543022735
In one case an AAA bone implant was lost due to infection.	0.8939503725378534
This is noteworthy as in approximately one third of the cases the bone implants were in direct contact with the frontal sinus.	1.1176021144960422
The clinical results clearly emphasize the therapeutical benefit of AAA bone for cranioplasties.	0.8713270136310214
Large AAA bone chips from human skull bones facilitate the reconstruction of the skull's convexity, especially when sterolithography-based operation planning is performed.	1.0193232353816635
Saphenous vein harvesting remains a 20 % source of morbidity in patients who require lower extremity bypass or coronary artery bypass grafting.	1.124240148833209
In an attempt to reduce the complications associated with this procedure, minimally invasive video-assisted vein harvesting is propagated.	0.9179486442252923
The technique uses currently available endoscopic equipment with mechanical retraction to dissect the great saphenous vein with two limited incisions.	0.7973120403184262
The dissection is visualized on the video monitor to isolate and control side branches by clips.	0.7913681876693008
The vein is removed for reverse arterial bypass grafting or dissection is completed for an in situ bypass procedure.	0.9619350782804638
Initial experience with ten patients undergoing peripheral bypass procedures showed a mean vein-preparation time of 60 min.	0.9247158494783875
Two of seven in situ bypass procedures were complicated by side branch damage controlled through longer skin incision.	0.8582533621743312
After a mean follow-up of 12 months, all bypasses are patent.	1.1190115804748966
Taking our own experience as well as that reported in the literature into consideration, aspects of cost-effectiveness are discussed.	1.1376228909869603
Obstructions of the nasolacrimal duct occur frequently (70%) in term newborns and are symptomatic in 6%.	1.096631688975514
The reason is an incomplete canalization and differentiation of the lacrimal duct during the fetal period.	1.0075246188837286
A persisting membran between the duct and the nasal cavity at the level of the valve of Hasner in combination with a proximal valvelike obstruction at the junction of the lacrimal canal and sac may cause a dacryocystocele by fluid accumulation.	0.9999566949705857
We describe a term newborn with a bilateral dacryocystocele and respiratory distress.	0.9676766177833381
The recognition of a medical discipline on a European level as an independent specialty depends on its registration in the medical directives of the European Union.	1.071061082844074
With supreme effort, the oral and maxillofacial surgeons of the EU reached this goal in 1989.	1.110054313408485
The UEMS - Section of Stomatology and Oromaxillofacial Surgery - became the forum for discussion of the relevant problems with representatives of the member states and officials of the European Commission.	1.0294296483364196
Thanks to its activities, oral and maxillofacial surgery is now recognized as an independent specialty with about 3800 specialists in 11 European countries.	0.9797000479921064
A biatrial pacemaker was inserted in a 68-year-old female with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter refractory to antiarrhythmic drugs based on a sick-sinus-syndrome and concomitant interatrial conduction delay.	1.0459086808239146
One electrode positioned in the right atrium and another electrode located in the coronary sinus were connected to a dual-chamber pacemaker.	0.9995126955484901
The electrode in the right atrium was connected to the atrial channel, the electrode in the coronary sinus to the ventricular channel.	1.141386485625797
The pacemaker was programmed in DDD-mode with an AV-delay of 30 ms.	0.879275783320043
Under a chronic antiarrhythmic medication with 160 mg sotalol per day there was no evidence for recurrent episodes of atrial tachyarrhythmias in the patient's history, 24-h-Holter-ECG, nor in the memory of the pacemaker during a follow-up of 8 months.	1.1671564783257167
The AB0 blood types, first discovered by Karl Landsteiner in 1901, can be genotyped with the PCR method of Lee and Chang [6].	0.8488223995833433
Using two primer pairs, allele-specific sequences can be amplified and, after digestion with restriction endonucleases, visualized by silver staining on a polyacrylamide gel.	0.9163561837672641
In a southwest German population the allele frequencies were: Allele A = 0.2704, allele B = 0.0741 and allele 0 = 0.6556.	0.9550733966974149
With the method of Lee and Chang [6] only the nucleotide positions 261 and 703 are considered so that out of 280 individuals 10 (3.57%) showed differences between the AB0 genotype and phenotype, because it was not possible to differentiate between A and 02 alleles.	1.1515828471332912
Based on the one experience and the information that is available in the literature indications for ankle arthroscopy are given, surgical equipment, patient placement and surgical technique of different procedures are described.	1.3228605787030607
Finally the results and possible complications are presented.	1.06863646964578
Removal of loose bodies as well as synovectomies in case of an acute infection or rheumatoid arthritis are good indication.	1.0105183878901367
Arthroscopic treatment of anterior pathology in the athletic ankle need a thorough diagnostic work-up; the results of the treatment do not always meet the expectations of this especially demanding population.	1.0610400501488306
Cartilage treatment is technically possible, however, long term results are still missing.	1.247949193543554
This is also true for the treatment on osteochondritis dissecans.	1.2047061367746503
In patients with degenerative joint disease arthroscopic debridement can only lead to a temporary benefit.	0.9407296561642383
Arthroscopic assisted arthrodeses (AAA) is technically demanding, but can serve as an excellent alternative to conventional open techniques.	1.23007442162693
The complication rate in ankle arthroscopy is high compared to other joints, which is especially true for neurologic complications and postoperative infections.	1.180277736928712
This should be addressed when performing the informed consent.	0.8157211856981401
Recent prospective randomised trials dealed with the optimal extent of surgical resection as well as with preoperative therapy modalities in pancreatic, rectal and breast cancer.	1.0416223584714304
In pancreatic cancer extended lymphadenectomy did not improve overall survival.	0.7902089349280318
Total mesorectal excision remarkably changed surgery for rectal cancer.	0.6446056141187693
Rate of local recurrence of rectal cancer could be significantly reduced by preoperative irradiation.	0.9817383781187239
In advanced rectal cancers curative resection and sphincter preservation seems possible due to multimodal preoperative therapy.	0.757253156126983
It has been demonstrated that in appropriate cases breastpreserving resection is comparable to mastectomy with respect to overall survival.	1.013627023928647
Up to now it is not quite clear if sentinel node sampling is equivalent to routine lymphadenectomy.	0.8640210063226186
Following neoadjuvant chemotherapy breastpreservation rate is significantly higher, but survival is not significantly increased.	1.0989557242203385
Introduction and Methods: A 0.5 T open-configuration MR system allows free access to the patient via a 58-cm-wide opening on both sides of the machine.	1.1721625827658404
A newly developed system for needle guidance enables the examiner to perform biopsies in combination with real-time imaging and to position laser fibers in the human body.	0.9836631650039079
For imaging, a 2D gradient echo sequence is used (TR 19 ms, TE 9 ms, flip angle 30  °, FOV 24 x 24 cm, slice thickness 10 mm matrix 256 x 128).	0.9029985804567718
The acquired images are displayed on two LCD screens localized within the MR system, thus allowing an interactive needle guidance.	0.9573339092681554
This procedure is illustrated by a case report.	0.8825357895991686
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are established drugs for the treatment of patients with heart failure and hypertension.	0.912581861816145
There is mounting evidence to suggest that ACE inhibitors may be used for different indications as well.	0.8911369512779354
The rational for the use of ACE inhibitors is to block the vasoconstrictive effects mediated by angiotensin II.	0.8495774384542658
The hemodynamic profile of ACE inhibitors is modified by additional effects such as interference with the degredation of bradykinin and accumulation of prostaglandin and nitric oxide (NO).	0.7543546068078876
Thus ACE inhibitors may be successful in preventing the negative effects of vasoconstriction on regional circulation.	0.9486111469495784
Since vasoconstriction, particularly of the mesenteric vasculature appears to be largely mediated by the renin-angiotensin-axis, ACE inhibitors are assumed to be effective in treating or avoiding gut mucosal hypoperfusion.	1.0171871180493957
The critically ill intensive care patient at risk of developing multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is still a major therapeutic challenge.	1.1488439678106
Intravenous preparations of ACE inhibitors may broaden our therapeutic armamentarium for these patients.	0.815346168995209
However, several questions about the exact mechanisms of ACE inhibitors, such as the ideal substance and the optimal dose, are still open.	1.3259919982230248
Moreover, further work needs to be done to definitely determine whether ACE inhibitors may be helpful to prevent or treat (micro-) circulatory catastrophe in these patients.	1.2268637346731528
The pharmacologic properties of ACE inhibitors provide an exciting stepping stone for future research in this field.	0.8157681892252431
Hypoparathyroidism (HP) results from deficient parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, pseudohypoparathyreoidism (PHP) results form decreased PTH action on its target organs.	0.9349702661103235
Between May 1996 and 1999, a total of 186 endoscopic spinal operations were performed to treat unstable injuries and pathologic fractures.	1.0098216082942537
The operative spinal interventions followed the classic sequence of excision of part of a vertebral body, partial replacement of the vertebral body with bone harvested from the iliac crest, and implantation of a titanium plate to stabilize the part to be fused.	1.0622403024069984
In 62% of these cases we performed primary dorsal straightening with a fixateur interne.	1.2597264772818473
The serious complications were aortic leakage and deep infection in the area of the graft and the implant, each of which occurred in 1 case.	1.1110510893791057
Comparisons with the literature showed approximately the same rate of spinal complications as with open surgery, while the rate of morbidity connected with the surgical approach was reduced to a third in the patient population treated endoscopically, with correspondingly positive implications for the postoperative analgesic requirement and for convalescence.	1.2603597040192651
Various risk scores have been developed for the assessment of operative risk in cardiac surgery.	1.0580809630409027
Although risk stratification has been acknowledged as a useful tool to analyze trends in therapy and changes in patient populations, its relevance in assessing the indication for surgery has been questioned.	1.1132663340921922
It was the goal of this prospective study to compare 6 common risk scores with regard to the predictive value for mortality in individual patients.	1.215346308931291
Between September 1998 and February 1999 all adult patients undergoing heart surgery were prospectively scored according to the following scores: initial Parsonnet, Cleveland Clinic, French, Euro, Pons, and the Ontario Province Risk score.	1.064515303771882
Early lethality was assessed within 30 days postoperatively.	0.7375093149723071
Follow-up was completed in 504 patients.	1.118121973778483
With the exception of the Ontario Province Risk score, lethality in the high risk group was overestimated by all scores, whereas lethality in low to moderate risk groups was underestimated by several scores.	1.07884459661019
Mean scores of surviving and deceased patients showed a broad overlap with high standard deviations.	0.8803557002238613
Preoperative risk scores are effective tools for stratification of patient populations and the analysis of surgical outcome.	0.9246345704763395
With the aid of risk scores, operative risk can be sufficiently predicted for patient populations or subpopulations.	1.0826859617339717
The Euro score best predicted the outcome of our patients.	0.8636992828003041
However, when the indication for surgery is to be determined in an individual patient, risk scores should be only considered as an orientation in the decision process.	1.5157355263200234
Background and objective: A complicated course of erysipelas is not uncommon.	1.0910462738467683
Bullous, haemorrhagic, necrotic and purulent lesions may be encountered.	0.6749300728418574
Today no reliable data exist as to which constitutional factors renders a patient at risk for developing complicated erysipelas though several risk factors, particularly diabetes mellitus, are often suggested.	1.0619467314146993
Based on the analysis of patients with erysipelas at the Department of Dermatology in Graz, factors determining the risk for complicated erysipelas should be identified.	1.1243563164513413
Patients/Methods: In a retrospective case-control study clinical data sheets of 766 in- patients treated at the department were evaluated with respect to the course of the erysipelas and with respect to potential risk factors.	1.2983920933214945
Results: General risk factors for local complications were location at the lower extremities, pre-existing hepatic or renal disease, hyperuricaemia, and diabetes mellitus.	1.2132407226790844
Hepatic and renal disease and - to a lesser extent - diabetes particularly predisposed for bullous and haemorrhagic lesions, while vascular occlusive disease enhanced the risk for ne- crotic lesions.	1.1274079957708938
Conclusions: Location and hepatic and renal disease are the most important risk factors, while diabetes is probably of less significance than previously suggested.	1.2846218702810397
Patients with end-stage liver disease frequently develop combined coagulopathies due to increased procoagulant and fibrinolytic turnover as well as thrombocytopenia.	0.8122413277568212
The onset of clinical symptoms of a haemorrhagic diathesis requires balanced substitution of coagulation factors, since fresh frozen plasma alone does not always maintain a sufficient haemostatic potential in these patients.	0.9843407037715715
This substitution commonly follows standard rules based on the assumption that 0.5 - 1 IU of a coagulation factor or inhibitor concentrate given per kg body weight will increase its endogenous activity by 1%.	1.104591805146368
We set out to investigate the validity of this standard regime in patients with end-stage liver disease scheduled for orthotopic liver transplantation.	0.8693332327373132
Fifty-one adult patients were prospectively studied.	0.8846053860653499
In 37 patients with antithrombin III (AT III) activity <70%, an AT III preparation (Kybernin, Behring, Marburg, Germany) was given preoperatively (mean dose 2616 +/- 207 IU) following standard calculations in order to increase endogenous activity to 80%.	1.1319739395934194
Twenty-seven of the patients had chronic hepatic failure (CHF group) with histologically proven cirrhosis and 10 had acute hepatic failure (AHF group).	1.144617424213499
Blood samples were drawn prior to a 15-min infusion of AT III concentrate and 30 min thereafter.	1.035642780411425
In 14 patients with prothrombin time (PT) <40%, AT III levels had been corrected earlier during the clinical course to achieve activities >70%.	1.2634187538867554
Prothrombin complex (PPSB, Beriplex, Behring, Marburg, Germany) was substituted (mean dose 2304 +/- 289 IU) to increase procoagulant activity to PT >60%.	1.0082402302663012
Blood samples were drawn in the same fashion as in the AT III group.	1.1472891906162481
The amounts of AT III and PPSB concentrates ( AT III, [IU/kg];  PPSB [IU/kg]) required to increase AT III activity and PT, respectively, by 1% were calculated.	1.4101056988407317
Standard calculations for AT III substitution indicated AT III recovery in all 37 patients who received AT III concentrate.	1.0482437325518796
However, there was a statistically significant difference between patients with CLF and ALF.	1.2244281613891457
In patients with CLF,  AT III was found to be 0.8 IU/kg ( +/- 0.1 SEM) and in those with ALF it was 1.5 IU/kg ( +/- 0.1 SEM) (P<0.05,  t-test).	1.2225663136071128
In patients treated with PPSB concentrate,  PPSB was 1.6 U/kg ( +/- 0.2 SEM) for both CLF and ALF groups.	1.2240611115723679
In patients with end stage liver disease standard rules for substitution with AT III-concentrate are adequate only for patients with CLF.	1.0500175056239194
In patients with ALF higher AT III doses are required to achieve the expected effect on endogenous AT III activity.	1.0172126004733575
Procoagulant activity, as reflected by PT, can be increased by 1% when 1.6 IU/kg PPSB concentrate is given.	1.1593226362393718
However, this study shows the effects of coagulation concentrates only 30 min after administration.	1.2432642499402373
An increased volume of distribution and increased turnover may explain the poor recovery of AT III activity in the ALF group, indicating that the dose of coagulation concentrate should be estimated against the background of the patient's clinical symptoms and diagnosis.	1.133813351608772
Fatigue is a common symptom in patients with multiple sclerosis.	1.1202572706997354
Rapid exhaustion and reduced exercise tolerance leads to difficulties in maintaining a normal daily life for many patients.	0.7832956529762768
Regular resting and short breaks can help to compensate this to a  certain degree.	0.9041497973465966
A sixteen year old girl with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis suffered two episodes of toxic shock syndrome within a short period of time.	0.9213109409662202
Both occasions were associated with menstruation.	0.5080081402934835
Mycoplasma hominis was isolated in the tracheal secretions once.	0.8449990288731097
Discussion: The etiology of the toxic shock syndrome has been extensively described.	0.9587390171573401
The toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 acts as a superantigen in toxic shock syndrome and interestingly a similar mechanism is discussed in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.	0.8938217126954817
This case report demonstrates the possibility of a close relationship between toxic shock syndrome and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and raises the suspicion of a similar immunopathogenetic process.	1.0212860523913891
Porokeratos of Mibelli is a rare inherited disorder of epidermal keratinization, whose pathogenesis is not fully understood.	0.9632203743731059
The common clinical feature is a erythematous plaque surrounded by a hyperkeratotic border.	0.77912123553079
The histopathologic hallmark is a parakeratotic cornoid lamella.	0.582371788911741
An unusual case of porokeratosis gigantea, a morphological variant of classical porokeratosis of Mibelli, is reported.	1.054290232359266
The pathogenesis, taking in account especially the clonal hypothesis and premalignant nature of porokeratosis, is discussed.	0.9992650998180421
With the introduction of the non-benzodiazepine hypnotics zopiclone and zolpidem it was expected to have hypnotics without side effects and risks characteristically seen with benzodiazepines.	0.9593792330028332
We report two cases with high-dose usage and dependency of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics.	0.8500268483636261
Both patients were prescribed the drugs to treat sleep disturbances occuring during a depressive episode.	0.9619910274347401
While one patient had a polysubstance abuse there was no evidence for an abuse history in the other patient.	1.0525808205799714
To reduce withdrawal symptoms long-acting benzodiazepines were given to both patients.	0.8941297863145744
Thus, it seems that not only patients with a history of substance abuse but also patients with a psychiatric disorder are at risk for abuse of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics.	1.21446055145843
Considering the increasing number of case reports with abuse and dependence of zopiclone and zolpidem it seems necessary to reevaluate the dependency risk of the currently available non-benzodiazepine hypnotics.	0.8991214940920467
Fractures of the proximal radius in children may lead to deformities of the radial head and functional disturbance of pro- and supination.	1.1488587927799176
However, traumatization is not only caused by the injury itself, but may also occur secondary to surgical reduction, manipulation of fracture fragments and excessive physiotherapy.	1.2454486583387288
In a prospective long-term follow-study (2-20 years after trauma) of 38 children with displaced proximal radius fractures we found functional disturbances in 11 % of children only.	1.3773908323411193
These were not caused by radial head deformities, which were present on 83 % of follow-up radiographs.	1.298879759109748
Functional impairment was mainly seen after open reduction or secondary growth disturbances.	0.8625186942520909
On follow-up radiographs all conservatively treated fracture angulations up to 60  ° had corrected themselves spontaneously.	0.954765364069635
In view of the high complication rates after open reduction and the poor functional results, as well as the inconvenience for the pediatric patient and the economic aspects, we recommend a primary conservative treatment concept of proximal radius fractures in children.	1.2347776520097424
Patients who have undergone cardiac surgery with use of extracorporeal circulation frequently reveal marked hypovolaemia in spite of a highly positive fluid balance.	0.9959998831954019
This is thought to be due to transient microvascular damage and extravascular fluid shift.	0.7438892495822174
Further volume replacement to achieve haemodynamic stability in the postoperative period may cause fluid overload and congestive heart failure.	0.8852125016550868
The present study was designed to investigate whether this fluid overload could be avoided by using a hypertonic-hyperoncotic solution (group I: HHL, 10% hydroxyethylstarch 200/0.5 in 7.2% saline) instead of two different standard colloid solutions (group II: HA, 5% albumin; group III: HES, 6% hydroxyethylstarch in 0.9% saline).	1.2305543469613471
Purpose: The temporomandibular joint is a place of motion where release of proinflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1 (IL-1) induces cartilage destruction via production of nitric oxide (NO).	0.8793755037579071
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of continuous passive motion in the form of cyclic stretch on the synthesis of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).	0.7968392464218127
Methods: Articular chondrocytes were harvested from rabbit cartilage slices and cultured in F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.	0.9918472206439359
Subsequently, cells (105/ml per well) were transferred to Flexercell plates, grown to 90% confluency, and subjected to one of the following regimens: (1) no mechanical strain (10 Hz, 20% elongation rate); (2) rhIL-1 (1 ng/ml); (3) mechanical strain; (4) mechanical strain and rhIL-1.	1.183773714082954
The cells were exposed to cyclic stretch for 24 h. Thereafter, cells were trypsinized and centrifuged on microscope slides in a cytospin centrifuge.	0.8667999982765149
The presence of iNOS was determined by indirect immunoperoxidase staining using polyclonal rabbit anti-iNOS as primary antibodies, and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as secondary antibodies.	0.9930994462795381
Diaminobenzidine was used as substrate for HRP.	0.8170901391259024
Total NO production was spectrophotometrically measured in the supernatants of cultures using Greiss reaction.	0.7333554209487013
All experiments were done in triplicates and the statistical significance was analyzed by Student's t-test.	0.9216777570936521
Results: Cells with treatment 1 and 3 did not exhibit presence of iNOS.	1.154376763446029
IL-1-treated cells in group 2 exhibited intense peroxidase staining.	1.2353565441845087
Cells in group 4 exposed to IL-1 and mechanical stress showed staining with considerably less intensity.	0.9453214064173305
Control cells treated with normal rabbit IgG as a primary antibody did not exhibit peroxidase staining.	0.9421486429306952
The data were further confirmed by measurement of statistically significant differences of NO levels in supernatants assessed in the four different treatment groups.	1.050131760581004
Conclusion: Our findings suggest that continuous passive motion exerts anti-inflammatory effects on chondrocytes, downregulating the quantity of iNOS -positive cells.	1.0037844374335991
Since NO acts as an intracellular, transcellular, and cytotoxic molecule, it has a basic importance for proper post-traumatic and postoperative TMJ function as well as the course and therapy of inflammatory TMJ diseases.	1.3256861703214808
Recently, we presented an implantable piezoelectrical hearing aid transducer.	1.1347436466264087
Its characteristics make it suitable for implantation in patients with sensorineural hearing loss.	0.7199169984124095
The transducer transmits micromechanical vibrations instead of sound into the hearing organ.	0.6441799925301118
Efficiency of the transducer implant was investigated in ten cat ears.	1.0366672661202414
After determining preoperative (acoustical) BERA threshold, the middle ear was opened and the piezoelectrical transducer coupled to various ossicles or the perilymph.	0.9895662008195091
BERA responses were recorded following stimulation of umbo, long incus process, stapes head, stapes foot plate, and vestibulum.	1.0382138211730805
By comparing the acoustical and mechanical threshold, a correlation was found between the stimulus level of acoustical and mechanical stimulation.	0.9124978438175164
An electrical transducer voltage of 1 Vrms* was equivalent to sound-pressure levels between 100 and 128 dB SPL at the tympanic membrane.	0.8635922091619771
To judge hearing impression, stimulus-dependent latencies of the early acoustically and mechanically evoked potentials (waves P1 to P5) and their thresholds were analyzed.	1.0051140812713266
After coupling the piezoelectrical transducer to the long incus process, latencies corresponded well to stimulation.	0.7743101696269635
They were almost completely similar when the equivalent sound-pressure level of 100 dB SPL was achieved by the transducer voltage level.	0.9348934562428974
Pyoderma gangrenosum was first described in 1930 by Brunsting, Goeckermann and O'Leary.	0.7406739694874407
Nevertheless we found some illustrations in an atlas on dermatology, published by Marie-Nicolas Devergie in the first half of the 19th century, which appear to be pyoderma gangrenosum.	0.9505372778826632
In addition to discussions of typical syphilitic affections of the skin, Devergie's "Clinique de la Maladie Syphilitique" includes illustrations of gangrenous ulcers, which appeared unexpectedly after local and systemic therapy with mercury.	0.994208335709072
Devergie interpreted those enlarging ulcers as a side effect of mercury therapy.	0.7395033230815518
Thus we were able to find evidence of pyoderma gangrenosum more than 100 years before first description in 1930.	0.8894873379433671
The etiology of this clinical picture is still unsettled.	1.0202326060817113
The favorite postulate has been a bacterial genesis which was the subject of numerous publications until the 1960s.	0.9586330122253955
Multiple-system atrophy (MSA) is characterized by progressive autonomic failure with cerebellar, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs.	0.9160273216101462
In MSA patients laryngoscopy often reveals unilateral or bilateral abductor vocal fold palsies.	0.6897900431896716
However, assessment of sites of obstruction and their severity is needed.	1.1377742234109576
We report our clinical experience in managing a 56-year-old, obese male MSA patient (1.76 m height, 100 kg weight, BMI 32.3 kg/m2) who was admitted for evaluation of snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness.	1.212136246761975
Endoscopy while awake demonstrated an incomplete abductor vocal fold palsy.	0.6882394626296947
Polysomnography confirmed heavy snoring with arousals (11.1/h) and an RDI of 1.4/h.	1.2883109964071726
Sleep efficiency was low (51.9%) due to long intermittent awake periods.	1.0710981001447768
Sleep videoendoscopy of the upper airway proved the entire pharynx to be open during REM and non-REM sleep.	0.9942237037584208
During inspiration fluttering movements of the vocal cords caused the snoring.	0.7446760955547966
This was regularly terminated by arousals.	0.5541464767486263
The further treatment is discussed.	0.7031945732246202
In general, glottic snoring without daytime stridor is rare and has only been described in MSA patients.	0.9912633190820058
However, certain of these patients will also be pharyngeal snorers.	1.439216430070716
The source of the sound and site of obstruction can only be diagnosed by sleep videoendoscopy.	0.9672220950127465
Introduction: Homografts for valve replacement are indicated in acute valve endocarditis.	1.0687803337614112
It is assumed that they possess anti-infective properties.	0.7743709794561201
Homografts are an established indication in aortic valve replacement.	0.8136353899663986
We present our early results with homografts for mitral valve replacement in acute endocarditis.	0.9498026698921556
The surgical management of enlarged inferior turbinates has been actively debated for more than a century.	0.7997560019564683
The second part of this review decribes the following techniques: laterofracture, submucous turbinectomy, concho-antropexy, partial turbinectomy, anterior turbinectomy, inferior turbinoplasty, total turbinectomy, and vidian neurectomy.	1.051195725878634
Indications, advantages, disadvantages, complications, and controversies of each treatment modalitiy are reviewed and discussed.	0.9560973772938546
Partial or submucosal resection should be prefered, because there are moderate side effects and the amount of turbinate excised can be altered according the degree of symptomatology.	0.9136328185393724
Total turbinectomy or vidian neurectomy are indicated if all other treatment attemps do not succeed.	0.7794163889425155
Acute oxalosis is an important disorder causing serious abnormalities.	0.8286937975884914
Acute oxalosis may come about by ethylene glycol poisoning; in recent years iatrogenic cases of acute oxalosis have also been described following iv treatments of naftidrofuryl, a vasodilator.	1.0565123931913578
Furthermore, chronic asymptomatic intestinal oxalosis may turn symptomatic by a superimposed major load of oxalate.	1.13650251261251
Acute oxalosis results in acute renal failure; in addition oxalate-induced angiopathy may be associated with necrosis of affected tissue.	1.0294772992943424
The diagnosis of acute oxalosis requires a demonstration of oxalate crystals in the urine and in other affected tissues.	1.109993267892507
In terms of therapy, hemodialysis should be used promptly in cases of ethylene glycol poisoning and a worsening of the renal function.	0.9178034813340092
In cases of a secondary chronic intestinal oxalosis prophylactic measures such as maintaining an elevated urinary flow rate and prescribing oral calcium supplements will be helpful.	0.9269214600036646
Generalized granuloma annulare is a rare variant of granuloma annulare affecting the trunk and extremities with a multitude of lesions.	0.9510838857082023
In contrast to localized granuloma annulare, generalized granuloma annulare occurs in older patients, shows a stronger association with diabetes, and is characteristically chronic.	1.1607741548678336
Like our 55-year-old patient, most patients present with papules and annular plaques; less often, macular or non-annular lesions may be encountered.	0.9384523427540261
Histology often fails to show necrobiotic or necrotic connective tissue changes demarcated by a palisading granuloma.	0.7691535941507025
Instead, there are diffuse dermal, band-like or nodular aggregations of histiocytes intermingled with some multinucleated giant cells and a predominantly lymphocytic infiltrate in the periphery.	1.026924751299058
Because of its special characteristics, it has been suggested that generalized granuloma annulare might constitute a separate disease entity and that it should be classed among the primary cutaneous histiocytoses as a diffuse dermal histiocytosis.	1.0675264598792196
Using immunohistochemistry to determine the macrophage phenotype of the lesional histiocytes, we have shown that generalized granuloma annulare is not a cutaneous histiocytosis.	1.1508816213179456
Neither MS-1 high-molecular-weight protein, a new specific marker for cutaneous non-Langerhans cell histiocytoses, nor CD1a, the well-known marker for Langerhans cells and Langerhans cell histiocytoses, is expressed by the lesional histiocytes of our patient.	1.1160470775671212
In contrast, the antigen expression pattern was diagnostic for non-infectious granulomas and was highly similar to that in localized granuloma annulare.	0.9885211149997116
In contrast to the successful treatment of localized granuloma annulare reported with intralesional interferon -1, systemic treatment with interferon -2b (9x106 units three times a week) was ineffective.	1.2065928592224822
The aims of the study were: (1) to predict reversal time from intensive atracurium blockade; and (2) to determine the optimal time of neostigmine administration during recovery from atracurium blockade, i.e., the time at which the administration of neostigmine results in the shortest total recovery time (time from administration of last supplemental dose of atracurium to train-of-four [TOF] ratio 0.70), and at the same time results in the shortest time from administration of neostigmine to TOF ratio 0.70.	1.1857348747454097
The spontaneous and neostigmine-facilitated recovery in 52 healthy women anaesthetised with thiopentone, fentanyl, droperidol, and nitrous oxide was followed.	0.8616473658615139
Post-tetanic count (PTC) of TOF stimulation of the ulnar nerve and mechanomyography were used for monitoring neuromuscular transmission.	1.0148571613633781
The neuromuscular blockade was induced with atracurium 0.6 mg/kg and supplemental doses of 0.15 mg/kg were given when the first twitch response in the TOF (TH1) had recovered to 20%.	1.1773311515160128
Neostigmine 0.036 mg/kg body weight was given at different levels of neuromuscular blockade to 37 of the patients.	1.0310307679698927
Multiple regression analyses including pre-reversal time (time from administration of the last atracurium dose to neostigmine administration), PTC, weight, and age of the patients suggest that pre-reversal time is the best predictor of reversal time: reversal time=27.3 min-(0.89xpre-reversal time [min]; (SEE=6.0 min).	1.1604228960048213
If pre-reversal time is unknown, PTC can be used: reversal time=24 min-(4.5xln PTC) at time of reversal); (SEE=6.8 min).	1.2170176252823408
Total recovery time was 47 min (SEM=2.0 min, n=15) in the patients allowed to recover spontaneously, and 29 min (SEM=1.2 min, n=29) in the patients reversed by neostigmine; the difference of 18 min (SE diff 2.0 min) was significant (P<0.0005).	1.296709343924325
The level of blockade indicated by PTC (1 - 24) at the time of reversal had no influence on the total recovery time.	1.13049359253375
The spontaneous recovery times from reappearance of TH1 and TH1=10% to TOF ratio 0.70 were 29.2 min (SEM=1.7 min) and 24.4 min (SEM=2.6 min), respectively.	1.0913543853498406
The results suggest that pre-reversal time is the strongest predictor of reversal time when neostigmine is administered during intense atracurium blockade.	0.8330075091533963
To achieve the optimal time-saving effect, neostigmine must be given 18 min (the time saved by giving neostigmine) plus 7 to 11 min (needed for neostigmine to reach its peak effect), giving a total of 25 to 29 min before TOF ratio 0.70.	1.0746155255363057
As TH1 is between 1% and 10% 25 to 29 min before TOF ratio 0.70 is reached during spontaneous recovery, the optimal level of neuromuscular blockade for neostigmine administration in atracurium blockade is when TH1 is between 1% and 10%.	0.9887653354233585
Reversal time can be predicted as 27.3 min-(0.89xpre-reversal time (min), and the optimal time of neostigmine administration in atracurium blockade appears to be when TH1 is 1% - 10%.	1.1876154171620028
A seminar for hospital physicians in management positions (Württembergische Verwaltungs- und Wirtschaftsakademie, Stuttgart) in October 1994 illustrated the immediate relevance of W. R. Bion's book Experiences in Groups and Other Papers, published in 1961.	0.9862547433962047
The aim of this article, recalling Bion's experiences in groups by presenting in seminar's leadership principles, is to show how these experiences can be applied to an understanding of the individual.	1.1227562073015296
If continuous seizure activity lasts longer than 5 minutes generalized tonic-clonic seizures require prompt treatment, if significant morbidity and mortality are to be avoided.	1.0002242776727972
The mortality varies (mean: 20%) depending on patient age and etiology.	1.2915109946680536
Control of status epilepticus is achieved by benzodiazepines in about 80% of cases: Lorazepam is recommended due to its longer-acting effects on the central nervous system.	1.0957932927829275
To maintain the anticonvulsive effect phenytoin is usually administered intravenously.	0.7410443696248824
Fosphenytoin (not approved in Germany) has advantages over phenytoin, because it can be given three times more rapidly and produces fewer side effects.	1.1772214517629231
The IV use of valproic acid in status epilepticus seems to be promising, but needs further evaluation.	0.9417077664837569
There is no generally accepted treatment protocol for the therapy of persistent seizure activity lasting more than 60 minutes (i. e., refractory status epilepticus).	1.090446445581185
Usually phenobarbital, or general anesthesia with thiopental or pentobarbital are treatment recommendations.	0.9273902502335145
In recent reports, the administration of midazolam or propofol proved to be effective and well-tolerated.	1.162546945886925
Since the life span of our society is increasing and the expectation of high functional demands is growing more and more older people take part in sports activities emphasises the necessity of early diagnosis of rotator cuff lesions and their correct treatment.	0.9820248461076732
The goal of any diagnostic means should be a proper treatment of rotator cuff lesions according to the detected pathology.	1.0523426620524656
New arthroscopic techniques to surgically reconstruct rotator cuff tears have brought the operative repair techniques another step further.	0.8550287742663327
In cases of large and complex cuff tears the surgeon can individually select an adequate reconstruction procedure which includes anatomical-, partial-, tendon-transfer and muscle-transfer repairs.	1.2093309542752517
In cases of irreparable tears with cuff-tear arthropathy and consecutive superior migration of the humeral head hemiarthroplasty or the inverse deltoid prosthesis have to be considered.	0.8564506236289107
Based on clinical, radiological and arthroscopic findings we developed algorithms that will lead to the best suited procedure for a given lesion.	1.0831497295998256
Almost all patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) experience symptoms of nocturnal hypoventilation during the course of the illness.	0.907849606999553
These symptoms can develop  years before death and may severely affect quality of life.	0.8723027392014658
Non-invasive intermittent home mechanical ventilation (HMV) via mask is a possible palliative measure for  these symptoms, which is not often used in  Germany.	1.169179937452117
We report on our experience with HMV in 24 patients with ALS.	1.142666247262458
Our data show a good palliative effect in 17 of 24 treated patients.	1.0065394470258306
Severe complications did not occur.	0.30366679646785516
The mean ventilation time at present is  14 months.	0.8875416928537659
Available options and their  consequences need to be discussed in detail with patients and relatives before HMV is  initiated.	1.0953669847269245
Many clinical studies have been performed investigating corneal endothelial cell loss after penetrating keratoplasty using different preservation methods.	0.9950179320327768
Most studies, however, included variable follow-up intervals, neglecting the dynamic cell loss over the course of time.	1.0939465766766956
The aim of this study was to perform endothelial cell evaluation 5 years after penetrating keratoplasty using two different storage methods.	0.9264415147263719
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is generally associated with ulcerative colitis (UC).	1.0309490581312637
The disease typically progresses slowly, but ultimately, and leads to cirrhosis, liver failure or bile duct cancer.	1.078361348963469
PSC patients with simultanous ulcerative colitis are also at higher risk for colorectal cancer.	0.715221300308157
At the present time, there is no effective treatment for PSC, although preliminary data show encouraging results after treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid.	1.0519895204120429
However, there are no data concerning the delay or prevention of progress of the disease with this drug, because follow-up time is not yet long enough.	1.4610577644575518
Isolated bile duct strictures should be treated endoscopically.	0.8607143646404527
The possible effect of proctocolectomy on the course of PSC is controversial.	0.7698922129509422
Liver transplantation is the therapy of choice for PSC in its final stage.	0.9089923064702327
The 5-year survival rate (89 %) is significantly better than after transplantation for other indications.	1.2068093857526694
Patients with ulcerative colitis have to be followed up by lifelong colonoscopy.	0.8401721638823514
Although the course of UC after transplantation is mostly asymptomatic, these patients are at higher risk for colorectal cancer.	1.1016870208123406
On 3 June 1998 a high-speed train (Inter City Express, ICE) collided with a bridge at a speed of 200 km/h.	0.90493698078933
The bridge collapsed and the rear wagons of the train were pushed into it with the power of the rear engine.	0.8314108029191657
The accident caused 101 deaths and 103 injuries.	0.623335337380304
Four minutes after the accident the alarm was raised, and 16 minutes after the accident the first doctor was on the scene, arriving from Celle, approx.	1.0510552152763961
Severe complications after chiropractic treatments rarely occur.	0.6058360912104059
They happen mostly when manipulating the atlantoaxial and the craniovertebral articulations or when not attending to the contraindications like partial dislocation and hemivertebra.	0.7758927859030411
Therefore, x-ray pictures from the part of the vertebral region to be treated are inevitable and likewise the medical scientific associations demand them uniformly to minimize the risks.	1.1397673357855826
Nevertheless, our case-report shows also inconspicuous radiological findings do not exclude local tumor infestation of the bones with possible deleterious results for the patient treated by the chiropractor.	1.194119951007803
In patients with painful, possibly hemorrhagic vesicles or black crusts, especially on hands/fingers or face/neck with typical history (contact to cows or feral/cats) the possibility of a cowpox/catpox infection has to be considered.	0.9810056885470089
The clinical diagnosis can be confirmed with the electron microscopy; cytoplasmic inclusions may be detected histologically.	0.9994999692661881
Further useful diagnostic tools are the identification of the cowpox/catpox virus by PCR or in cell culture as well as serological tests to detect virus specific antibodies.	0.9719053322046939
We report the development of typical skin lesions of a cowpox/catpox infection in two female patients who had contact with cows or cats.	1.157103241964653
Recent diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are also discussed.	1.0159762246982167
The laboratory findings of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets are signs of an acute pregnancy complication often associated with abdominal pain and intrauterine growth retardation.	1.0325962672095486
A high coincidence with symptoms of preeclampsia is observed.	0.7594186202506508
The high rate of complications and the restitution of laboratory findings to normal values following cessation of pregnancy have led to the general recommendation of immediate delivery for about a decade.	1.0414320197860971
However, the fact that HELLP syndrome can also occur for up to 1 week post-partum and the results of studies on prolongation of pregnancy call this former concept of management into question, in particular, since there is a high rate of hemostasiological complications after cesarean section in acute HELLP syndrome.	1.1359795414289466
Because of the correlation of complications of HELLP syndrome with those of severe preeclampsia, the indication for delivery should be based on the signs of preeclampsia and additional clinical features.	1.0423501601703467
The results of studies on prolongation of pregnancies in HELLP syndrome and severe preeclampsia support this concept.	0.8506546857085474
Innervation of the head and neck differs from other regions of the body in certain respects.	1.0103156435733909
In particular, besides the external cuneate nucleus, thick-calibre neck muscle afferents project directly, to the vestibular nuclear complex.	0.9981398570188392
This projection is most prominent in segments C2 and 3 and is sparse or absent in more caudal segments.	0.8995845443523013
Thus, proprioceptive neck muscle afferents gain direct access to vestibulospinal, vestibulooculomotor and other secondary or even higher order vestibular neurons that receive labyrinthine input.	0.9189658780405308
Proprioceptive input via indirect spinovestibular pathways is also most prominent from C2 and 3 compared to more caudal levels.	0.8250527104027496
Likewise, thin calibre, mainly nociceptive afferents from cervical segments are channelled via the parabrachial nuclei in the rostral pons to limbic structures different from the targets of thoracolumbar afferents.	0.9370730696441979
It is tempting to consider these neuroantomical peculiarities relevant for the pathogenesis of the puzzling symptoms after whiplash injury.	0.8920383842750642
In some recent German textbooks of pain management there is maintained that psychological dependence to opioids in pain patients is not a real problem.	0.9818808320809331
The evidence for this statement is reviewed.	0.9544612507118322
Real bone tumors are rarely encountered in the daily routine of radiological practice.	0.9260707322914072
Therefore, for a general radiologist there is no need for a specialist knowledge on this field.	1.502952610015716
However, he should be able to distinguish benign from malignant lesions in order to avoid unnecessary biopsies.	1.3755288514587767
A systematic approach towards osteolytic lesions, e. g. according to the classification of Lodwick, is mandatory.	0.9695861328932144
CT and MRI are indicated to clear up the anatomy in areas of superposition artefacts in conventional radiology and to determine the inner structure of a lesion, e. g. fatty tissue, liquid/solid.	0.9657146981993076
This paper highlights the advantages and disadvantages and the cost-effective use of the imaging modalities including scintigraphy in the diagnosis of bone tumors and tumor-like lesions.	1.2482756518686837
Guidelines for the management of bony lesions will be given in detail.	0.9260893036477427

During routine middle ear surgery prototypes of implantable piezoelectric hearing aid transducers were coupled to the ossicular chain of 28 patients.	0.8673794435039773
Pure tone thresholds in a broad frequency range (250 Hz-8 kHz) and perception of music were the basis of psychoacoustic evaluation of the transfer properties of the prototypes in this human study.	1.1344935240162373
The piezoelectric transducer reached an equivalent transducer sound-pressure level of up to 145 dB SPL and frequencies of 10 kHz.	0.8389790031968466
The dynamics for music reached 32 dB, which was identical with the results of the preoperative investigations using hi-fi headsets (33 dB).	1.2093256770438086
The low nonlinear distortions of around 0.1% and the frequency range up to 10 kHz are reflected in the positive evaluation of sound quality by 84% of the patients involved.	1.278536689600494
The study is the basis for realizing a piezoelectric transducer designed for routine clinical implantations.	1.0399736938918138
The transducer is thought to be part of a totally implantable future hearing aid for rehabilitation of moderate and severe sensory neural hearing loss predominantly in the middle and high frequency range.	1.0349198314249337

Several investigations prove that monaural acoustic deprivation induces detrimental changes in the auditory pathway.	0.8221827114323933
So far the major interest focused on degenerative processes on the deprived side, while effects on the contralateral untreated side were not taken into consideration.	1.0041459811296847
This ontogenetic study investigates effects of early monaural acoustic deprivation on the functional development of the acoustically evoked auditory brainstem response (ABR) in the Mongolian gerbil.	1.066174556616106
Young gerbils were deafened by a single intracochlear application of neomycin sulfate.	0.756373863620201
The ABR development on the contralateral side differed in a late developmental period from that of normally hearing animals.	0.889537256560906
These changes persisted until adulthood.	0.49679885026549625
Between day 55 and day 90 a significant 5 dB decrease of the ABR thresholds and a significant shortening of the interpeak latency II-V occured.	0.9355927599987234
The results confirm that a complete monaural deprivation during the sensible or critical period leads on the contralateral side to plastic or compensatory changes in the auditory brainstem.	0.9752359887650749
There are estimated to be 20 million people blinded by cataracts, 80-90 % of whom live in rural areas of developing countries where expert surgical resources are scarce.	0.9510426237794602

Dorsal fusion with the internal fixator has become the standard treatment of instabilities and deformities of the thoracolumbar spine.	0.9637171403195893
With our new device, the modular spine fixator (MSF), which has been specially designed for short-distance instrumentations, we have increasingly been treating unstable injuries of the thoracolumbar spine by one-level stabilization.	1.1674737852539685
Prerequisite is an accurate evaluation of the indication, including CT and MRI to assess the involvement of the intervertebral disc and the ligamental structures.	1.1641440474316722
The operative technique differs in some details from the procedure in moremulti-level instrumentations, especially concerning the application of the pedicle screws.	1.103855500024286
The instrumentation is always combined with posterior allogenic bone grafting.	0.7292462510683273
Since the beginning of 1993 we also perform anterior autogenic transpedicular bone grafting.	0.8006201612491298
Between Januar 1991 and July 1995, 57 one-level stabilizations with the MSF were performed.	0.882228056384825
Of the 57 patients operated on 39, 27 men and 12 women, with an average age of 41 years, have had a clinical and radiographic follow-up examination so far, on average, 27 months after the accident.	1.3051660353042431
Seventeen patients were completely free of pain and 17 patients (were only) sensivite to weather changes or had minor pain during great physical stress.	0.9609141447380642
Five patients had pain even during slight physical stress or at rest.	0.8593418474227975
The preoperatively measured Cobb angle was 15.1  ° on average, after the operation 5.2  °, and at the time of the follow-up examination amounted to 8.1  °.	1.3041017545423612
The patients' range of motion was normal.	1.1266606476875323
Only five minor complications have been seen.	0.7229709105015383
No implant fatigue failure has been noted in this series.	0.7607003382686919
We derive from these results that, for correct indications, one-level stabilization can be performed successfully and should be firmly established in the operative treatment of unstable fractures of the thoracolumbar spine.	1.1605750587776327
Between May 1995 and March 1996 we were able to diagnose and remove glomus tumors of the left nasal cavity from three female patients.	1.0157370540954296
Ages of the patients were 9, 36 and 74 years.	1.3002217187707659
All patients suffered from a frequent epistaxis and all were extremely sensitive to the slightest nasal touch.	0.9302870806937553
One patient reported breathing difficulties due to nasal congestion.	0.6825330250904201
Examination revealed a tumor that filled the entire nasal cavity.	0.8667293043731511
The method of choice in treatment of these tumors is surgical removal.	1.2004370927278447
Hemangiopericytoma, non-chromaffin paraganglioma,  hidradenoma, cavernous hemangioma and nevus cell nevi have to be excluded by histology and immunohistochemical techniques.	1.057800085482327
From a clinical perspective the bleeding  septal polyp (granuloma telangiectaticum sive pyogenicum sive pediculatum) has to be considered because it often comes from Kieselbachi's plexus, has a mushroom-like appearance and bleeds slightly.	1.0563988600860714
Background: Gynaecological surgery including laparoscopy is frequently associated with PONV.	1.16000914419864
Therefore, choosing an anaesthetic with only little side effects in operations eligible for outpatient surgery is at least as important as applying anaesthetics that enable fast-tracking.	1.1152578570491962
The reliability of continuous fibreoptic oximetry in cerebral venous blood and its correlation with intracranial and cerebral perfusion pressures (pressure-volume curve) were examined in an experimental porcine study.	1.1343449790483153
In a population-based study of 110 women between 53 and 82 years of age (mean age 64.5 +/- 7.9 years) static posturography data were compared to functional items of gait and balance in common geriatric mobility scales.	1.0050870198357589
Posturographic data of double-stance with eyes open and eyes closed (DSEO; DSEC) did not differ from those of a group of healthy women previously tested for intact nervous system function.	0.9505989749991867
The total neuromuscular score - roughly corresponding to the well-known Tinetti score - did not correlate to the posturographic measures.	1.0534493658949424
DSEC correlated with the items "rapid walking" and "single-stance left leg".	0.7867868743004884
Age, vision, and neuropsychologic test results correlated with DSEO, "rapid walking", "single-stance right leg", "single-stance left leg", and "walking a figure eight".	1.1138387772164322
Multiple linear regression confirmed the impact of age, vision, DSEO, and DSEC on "rapid walking" with a 34% variance explanation.	0.9710584415549711
Posturographic parameters did predict other selected gait and balance items.	0.7306617628120488
When used in older women living independently in the community, parameters of static posturography reflect to some extent the functional disabilities of gait and balance.	0.9720679909516032
The ocular surface epithelia with the tear film as a unit provide clear vision and comfort and serve as the first line of defense.	0.887038702907881
It is important to understand how ocular surface health is maintained and how ocular surface failure occurs.	0.8592687772225786
Furthermore, it is timely to summarize new information concerning action mechanisms and clinical uses of amniotic membrane transplantation for ocular surface reconstruction.	1.0985215468609528
When appropriately processed and preserved, amniotic membrane as a native matrix can be used as a graft to restore conjunctival surfaces following removal of lesions such as pterygium, tumor, scar, symblepharon, and conjunctivochalasis.	0.9453085816050588
It can also be used as a graft to restore corneal surfaces suffering from limbal stem-cell deficiency.	0.881700528760071
For partial limbal deficiency, amniotic membrane alone is frequently sufficient, while for total limbal deficiency it needs to be combined with limbal stem-cell transplantation with or without corneal transplantation.	0.9193900189200112
When used as a graft or patch, amniotic membrane can facilitate healing of persistent corneal ulcers and recurrent corneal erosion and reduce corneal haze following keratectomy.	0.9004104148144039
Reported data indicate that amniotic membrane transplantation facilitates rapid healing with recovery of a normal epithelial phenotype in the epithelium and reduces inflammation, vascularization, and scarring in the stroma.	0.9798675361749559

Introduction: Improved socio-economic conditions have led to an increase of adult height during the last century.	1.2435320168129156
If excessive height is regarded as a serious psychological handicap, final height can be reduced by early and high doses treatment with sexual steroids.	1.032368405487964
This therapy influences pubertal development and growth of healthy adolescents.	0.7871003555818832
For that reason patients should be carefully selected, taking into account the benefits and possible side effects.	0.9768404527030772
Colour measurements were performed on powdery substances of whitish to slightly yellow colouring (cocaine samples of different composition) in order to give an unequivocal optical description of the samples and relate them to control samples.	1.0159534822841096
The measurements were carried out with a spectrophotometer (Carl-Zeiss-Jena GmbH, MCS 400) using a halogen bulb as light source (standard illuminant D65).	0.9739568835561456
Colorimetric classification was made on the basis of the CIE-L*a*b*-values.	0.7135752809913856
The examination showed that specimens of similar or different chemical composition which could not be distinguished macroscopically revealed characteristic differences in the CIE-L*a*b*-measures.	0.7753756663274034
The method gives a first clue for orientation within a few minutes when comparing substances in specimens of different origin.	1.000045790532515
Eighty-five patients with grade 2 or grade 3 sprains of the acromioclavicular (AC) joint were evaluated clinically and radiographically 32 months after injury.	1.0741412047412604
Group I included 34 patients with grade 2 sprains (Tossy II) and group II included 51 patients with grade 3 injuries (Tossy III).	1.150925899144126
In group I, 15 patients were treated surgically (group I a) and 19 patients were treated conservatively (group I b), while in group II, 41 patients were treated surgically (group II a) and 10 patients were treated conservatively (group II b).	1.3843476987851395
At surgery open reduction and transarticular fixation of the AC joint with Kirschner wires was performed.	0.8311400133024008
Conservative treatment included the initial use of a sling or a knapsack bandage and early performance of range-of-motion exercises.	1.0082357706604614
Shoulder function was assessed according to the score devised by Constant and Murley.	0.8939621209244013
In both groups, 97 of 100 possible points (minimum 72, maximum 100) were obtained after conservative and after surgical treatment.	1.0948324800352913
Nine of 10 patients (90%) with grade 3 sprains (group IIb) had more pronounced displacement and increased mobility of the lateral end of the clavicle after conservating treatment.	1.2633073160023547
After surgery, dislocation and increased horizontal, mobility of the lateral end of the clavicle occurred in 18 (44%) of 41 patients with grade 3 sprains (group II a P<0.0001).	1.1375495387215755
However, these findings did not correlate with the functional outcome.	1.1062925647313475
At follow-up there was a significant increase in degenerative changes seen on radio-graphs (P<0.035) in all patients.	1.1985427834545261
Again these findings did not correlate with the functional outcome.	0.5519076702698463
More degenerative radiological changes were observed in patients who had undergone surgery (P<0.003).	1.1438896546896444
Patients with grade 2 sprains were more frequently restricted in sporting activity after surgery (P<0.05).	0.7070259353688991
Patients with grade 3 sprains who were treated surgically complained of pain more frequently (P<0.01), and they returned to work later than patients who were treated conservatively after grade 3 sprains.	1.1351534153883047
An additional rehabilitation program guided by a physiotherapist seemed to have no impact on the functional outcome.	0.9105484639953533
A total of 56 patients were treated by surgery.	1.0596612758156367
Among these patients 11 complications occurred, requiring five additional surgical procedures.	0.8325687948310984
Among 29 conservatively treated patients, only in 1 patient did subacromially located arthritic changes of the AC joint have to be removed.	1.1106718412179242
Macular amyloidosis (MA) and lichen amyloidosus (LA) are the two major variants of the primary cutaneous amyloidoses which present with severe and therapy resistent itching.	1.2645837273404774
Various therapeutic modalities such as antihistamines, intralesional injection or topical application of corticosteroids, etretinate, UVB irradiation and dermoabrasion have been employed with variable success.	0.8586415886750649
Recently, in a few case reports authors have observed encouraging beneficial clinical effects by using topical dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO).	1.2324858007427826
In our study 10 patients with either MA or LA or biphasic amyloidosis were treated with a 50% solution of DMSO in water.	1.1797871655041265
9 of them showed marked clinical improvement at the end of 6-20 weeks of treatment.	0.9938961731762149
Degranulation and depletion of the mast cells by DMSO is the most probable explanation for the rapid improvement of itching beginning within the first week of therapy.	1.0840737680252854
Remarkable flattening of the lichenoid papules which was obtained within 11 weeks of treatment is interpreted as a result of the improvement of itching and the related scratch effect.	1.090973772705263
Histological examination after treatment revealed no disappearance of amyloid deposits in the papillary dermis.	0.8471585920255685
In the follow-up period relapses of itching and papules were observed.	0.9741477410878817
Therefore further studies are needed to find out the optimal procedure of therapy.	0.9063862072983352
As early as 1974, Brian advocated the prone position for ventilated patients [5].	0.8975387715451607
He suggested that this position might enhance ventilation of the dorsal parts of the lungs, thereby improving oxygenation.	1.1322022257229511
These considerations have been confirmed by several experimental and clinical studies [1, 6, 13, 17].	0.9790682990829528
Better secretion removal, decreased intrapulmonary shunting, and an increased FRC are thought to be responsible for the observed improvement of oxygenation.	1.1047457407776025
However, the prone position never became very popular in the clinical treatment of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).	0.9720996763816647
Routine performance of thoracic CT scans in ARDS patients demonstrated preferential distribution of pathological densities in the dependent lung areas.	0.842767113548302
The prone position therefore could possibly benefit these patients, as shown by two recent studies [8, 11].	1.0600769313615483
The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of repeatedly turning the patient to the prone position on gas exchange and thoracic CT findings in multiple-trauma patients.	0.8855310689745506
Seven ventilated intensive care patients with severe ARDS (Murray Score >2.5 [9], Quotient >0.7 [4], mean airway pressure >18 cm H2O, thoracic CT scan showing dorsal atelectases) were included in the study.	1.4116244125822757
Patients were turned from the supine to the prone position at 12-h intervals using an air-cushion bed (Mediscus, Austria).	0.8809079978616169
Redistribution of dystelectatic or atelectatic dependent lung areas was verified by means of repeated thoracic CT scans (Figs.	0.7201071431522333
The patients were intermittently turned for 6.5  +/-  1.1 days.	1.2069912384901336
The course of gas exchange is shown in Figs.	0.971586803897595
Initially, improvement of the respiratory quotient could only be achieved during prone positioning, from the 2nd day in the supine position as well.	1.1824976907059574
Intrapulmonary shunting showed a similar trend (Figs.	0.6035439124437041
No significant changes in cardiovascular parameters could be observed.	0.7043877177510114
Control thoracic CT scans showed uniform reduction of atelectases in dependent lung areas (Figs.	0.7700267378142609
The inspiratory fraction of oxygen could be reduced significantly as of the 2nd day (Fig.	0.9347000183285918
Constant levels of positive end-expiratory pressure and tidal volume were associated with decreasing mean and plateau airway pressures (Fig.	0.8193775417652539
Repeatedly turning the patient to the prone position produced long-lasting improvement of arterial oxygenation, which persists up to the end of the weaning process.	1.0961313992861865
This is in good accordance with other studies [1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 13, 17], however, this is the first study to report an observation period of more than 6 days of repeatedly turning the patient.	1.1253202757146177
These positive effects on gas exchange can be attributed to sudden improvement of the ventilation-perfusion ratio within the lung areas that become dependent after turning to the prone position.	0.7928580699206359
Due to reduced hydrostatic pressure [11] and relative hyperventilation [7, 16], previously collapsed alveoli are recruited in the lung areas that become non-dependent after turning to the prone position.	0.9514914979242484
After a gynecological operation under therapy with unfractionated and low molecular weight heparin, a 63 year old patient developed right-sided ascending pelvic thrombosis with multiple pulmonary embolism and infarction pneumonia, septic-toxic circulatory failure, and thrombocytopenia.	1.0764602537792394
Heparin-associated thrombocytopenia (HAT) type II was diagnosed.	0.8984265120141733
Because of contraindications against thrombolysis a cava-filter was implanted, heparin therapy was stopped, and anticoagulation with recombinant hirudin was started.	0.9740529699881295
Inspite of this, an arterial thrombosis of the A. femoralis superficialis developed and had to be treated surgically.	1.0515948228850664
From this time on, no further thromboembolic complications were noticed.	0.9768188270394732
Overlapping coumarin therapy was begun.	0.5803840659111102
Due to ubiquitous coumarin-necrosis, rapid progressive toxic circulatory failure with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) developed two days after terminating hirudin therapy necessitating high dose catecholamine therapy.	0.8208968027031057
A second course of hirudin resulted in complete restitution of the coumarin-necrosis without the need for re-operation.	0.780799297793071
Subsequent coumarin-therapy, which was gradually increased over two weeks, was without further complications.	1.1947914419989663
Thus, hirudin appears to be a new and safe alternative to a therapy with the heparinoid danaparoid in HAT type II with fulminant thromboembolic complications and especially in coumarin-necrosis with critical septic-toxic circulatory failure and DIC.	1.097709552140986
A prospective process-analysis evaluating organizational, medical and medical-technical alterations and real-time-documentation during out-of-hospital resuscitations (n=71) was performed due to the definitions of the "Utstein-Style".	1.0594337194545067
The gaseous radical nitric oxide (NO) is catalyzed by conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline by one cytokine inducible form (iNOS), which becomes active only within hours after the inducing event, and by two constitutively expressed forms, endothelial (eNOS) and neuronal (nNOS), which are regulated by the cytosolic concentration of free Ca2+.	1.1329686176758604
Brain nNOS is physiologically present in discrete populations of neurons, which are all excited by glutamate via the ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, which controls a Ca2+ channel.	0.9332103676925508
After its diffusion into the extraneuronal space, NO may activate in neurons, which as a rule do not stain for NOS, soluble guanylyl cyclase and formation of cGMP as an intracellular messenger.	0.9775297639590464
Beyond that, NO is important as a feedback regulator of glutamatergic excitation.	0.8930662198506912
NO as a nitrosylating agent enhances disulfide bonding of vicinal sulfhydryl (thiol) groups of the redox modulatory site of the NMDA receptor complex and thereby down-regulates its Ca2+ channel activity.	0.8159691571271926
Histochemically studies have revealed the presence of large number of NOS containing neurons in the magnocellular and parvocellular subdivisions of hypothalamic nuclei.	0.8806688067816504
Numerous studies conform to the view that NO participates in the control of many different neurosecretory processes, especially of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurosecretory system.	0.9338362164319784
The redox-modulatory site of the NMDA receptor appears, therefore, as a critical structure in the control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis.	0.8906751219845854
Moreover, glucocorticoids augment neuronal excitotoxicity by increasing the expression of glutamate receptors and inhibition of glutamate reuptake.	0.9235887663500918
In attempting to explain the many conflicting results obtained in studies with NO, it may be worthwhile to consider that the actual redox-environment of distinct loci of the brain may determine the final function of NO, acting either as a transmitter or neuromodulator or, in the worst case, causing neurodestruction.	1.1265114600280186
It seems likely that any kind of stress by altering the ratio of reduced vs oxidized thiols within the central nervous system influences neuronal excitability, with NO working either as an amplifier or as a feedback regulator of neuronal excitation or inhibition, which may alter acutely or chronically, among others, the homeostasis of a given neurosecretory system.	1.0811364245287671
Purpose: To study early and late findings of macular retinal thickness in patients with hypotony following filtering procedures.	1.0478189152922965
Even in the era of coronary stenting, acute coronary artery occlusion continues to represent a significant limitation of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA).	0.873429494795946
Despite application of heparin and aspirin, abrupt vessel closure still occurs in 2-8%, depending on the definition applied.	1.0717383881455038
Especially patients receiving PTCA for acute coronary syndromes are at high risk for abrupt vessel closure.	0.9288812725197501
The formation of an intracoronary thrombus plays a central role in the pathogenesis of abrupt vessel closure.	0.8087281534343244
Dipyridamole induces dilatation of coronary arteries and prevents platelet aggregation by a mechanism that differs from that of aspirin.	0.8889461130523545
The primary purpose of the study was to evaluate whether adjunctive local intracoronary therapy with dipyridamole could reduce the incidence of coronary artery occlusion following PTCA.	1.0456194840849542
Secondary endpoints were defined as myocardial infarction, necessity for bypass grafting, and death.	1.0192799243649981
The intravesical instillation of BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) in cases of relapsed superficial bladder cancer is an acknowledged kind of prophylaxis.	0.882478105156718
It is uncertainly up to now whether a verification of the immune systems competence is necessary.	0.9647745101183877
The recommendations in this problem are very different.	0.8167988130801594
In conclusion to the recent literature we think that a verification of the immune system before BCG installation in the urinary bladder has not a prognostic value.	0.9838596772850764
Additionally, the legal obligingness of this immunotest is doubtful.	0.893897511775399
Discoid meniscus is one of the commonest anatomical variations of the meniscus.	0.8399160553864058
There is at the moment no consensus on the aetiology of discoid meniscus.	0.9226401037712751
According to Watanabe three types can be differentiated: the complete form, the incomplete form and the hypermobile Wrisberg form.	1.0695735503734507
Discoid meniscus frequently remains asymptomatic and thus requires no treatment.	0.7203683734654328
Partial meniscectomy is recommended for treatment of the stable form, while for the unstable forms total meniscectomy is generally regarded as the treatment of choice, since the instability means that rupture of residual meniscus would be possible.	1.2821088857241218
A fourteen years old girl showed the classic signs of acrocephalosyndactyly I: dysostosis craniofacialis with hypertelorism, exophthalmus, strabism, amblyopia and cleft palate as well as syndactyly of the fingers and toes.	0.8981215022870469
The feet showed on both side a 6  cm long horny band.	0.8479431918883035
Since the twelfth year of life, she had suffered from papulo-pustular acne with many comedomes.	0.842197860950453
Her menstruation started one year later.	0.7063861929982328
At time of her birth, her father was 54 years old, and her mother 36 years old.	0.9567716556368975
Two elder siblings are healthy.	0.4497496912673216
The inheritance of acrocephalosyndactyly I is usually autosomal dominant, but sporadic cases are frequent.	1.0348502182624042
Objective: Cognitive dysfunction is a known problem after operations and may be especially relevant in the elderly.	1.1170218322909702
The aim of this international multicentre study was to investigate short- and long-term cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients and to elucidate the relevance of hypoxaemia and hypotension as causative factors.	1.1959738646848888
Autosomal recessive inheritance, intrauterine growth retardation, short stature, microcephaly, distinct facial dysmorphism, psychomotoric retardation, and often uncharacterized eczematous skin lesions distinguish the rare Dubowitz syndrome.	0.9432580960928149
Here a pair of monozygotic twins with Dubowitz syndrome and clear-cut atopic eczema is presented.	0.7798342985603579
Humeral shaft fractures can be treated either conservatively or operatively.	0.8670670094557678
Plating of the humerus is the established operative method, but recently interest has also been focussed on intramedullary nailing.	1.0855286770867894
Fifty-nine cases of humeral fractures treated with intramedullary nailing (Seidel/Marchetti-Vicenzi/Prévot) from January 1991 to December 1995 (44 fractures after trauma, 11 pathological fractures, 3 pseudarthroses, 1 re-fracture).	1.130065782630485
Closed reduction in 55/59 cases.	0.6830747229515641
One infection (soft tissue); 2/48 pseudarthrosis (indication for nailing: pseudarthrosis!).	0.9783679099714898
No iatrogenic palsy of the radial nerve.	0.7579630414596514
Functional postoperative treatment in all 44 cases of humeral fractures after adequate trauma.	0.9271538479747992
One poor functional result: periarticular ossification after retrograde nailing, possibly connected with long-term respiratory treatment after trauma.	0.9337213592943073
Treatment of humeral shaft fractures by intramedullary nailing is favoured in our clinic (low complication rates, excellent or good functional results, limited approaches, small scars).	1.136580908612332
Proximal fractures should be treated by the Seidel nail (stable interlocking of the proximal fragment); very distal fractures need Prévot nailing (reaming of condylar canals).	1.024696586330328
All other fractures of the humeral shaft can be treated by each of the implants used in our clinic.	1.2497142957279292
Pathological fractures are an excellent indication for intramedullary stabilization.	0.8671443539413627
These patients benefit from stable fixation without intense surgical trauma.	0.6849021990751204
Pseudarthrosis, according to our limited experience, seems to require plating plus bone grafting.	0.886902388603116
Plating is also recommended if revision of the radial nerve becomes necessary.	0.8698504046552791
2-4 % of vascular injuries need operative reconstruktion.	1.1718000905792345
In polytraumatized patients the rate is even 10 %.	0.8882567095730484
Arterial vascular repair should precede venous reconstruction and orthopaedic stabilization due to limb threatening ischemia.	0.7575856664074986
Penetration or blunt vascular trauma result either in acute blood loss, ischemia or compartmental compression.	0.9318681204181382
Reperfusion syndrom leads to vital threat of patient.	0.6132349804505465
Clinical assessment, measurement of limb pressures using a Doppler device and use of duplex ultrasonography are reliable adjuncts in the rapid evaluation.	0.8525998962858092
Arteriography is rarely indicated and should be spared for patients with abnormal physical examination.	0.8448792333112898
Minimizing ischemia (6-8 h) is an important factor in maximizing limb salvage.	1.2502536735334508
Vascular repair include direct anastomosis or lateral suture repair mostly combined with primary shortening of the extremity.	0.8746696739307257
In most cases autogenous vein graft is required.	0.7600134622154213
Rethrombosis, arteriovenous fistula and pseudoaneurysms are possible complications.	0.7470706266266379
Stabilisation of the fracture has priority over vascular reconstruction.	0.9025902404582569
The initial steps to success are surgical debridement, adequate bony stabilization mostly by external fixation, revascularisation of vascular injury, immediate fascial decompression and early soft-tissue reconstruction.	0.9051977311251587
The best results are obtained when a multidiciplinary approach is used combining expertise in orthopedic surgery, vascular surgery and plastic surgery.	0.9885747067213592
In secondary prevention, statins are cost-effective and even more cost-effective than other lipid lowering drugs.	0.9567763517971938
Statins are especially favorable in patients with previous myocardial infarction compared to those with angina pectoris.	0.9977636748909724
For secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, statins should be administered generously.	0.8245043193075599
In primary prevention, statins are effective but not cost-efficient.	0.8506243608586201
Unfavorable results have to be expected especially in premenopausal women, younger patients, and in those with a low risk factor profile.	1.2001331503665715
For population based primary prevention, only dietary measures can be advocated; however, apart from a serious lack of compliance their efficiency has not yet been proven.	1.1277557370307496
Preventive measures have their own prize; in general they are considered not to prevent coronary heart disease but retard it.	1.0558974102333425
Therefore, such therapeutic interventions can be assumed not to reduce but rather to increase the "direct" medical costs.	1.3731501662579961
Furthermore, successful prevention of coronary heart disease leads, due to life-prolongation, to an increase in people out of work and in disabled patients due to age and/or disease.	1.1599977656476896
Therefore, an increase especially of the "indirect" costs for unemployment, pension, nursing homes, etc.	1.1013226172884285
Background: There are three fields where the the biochemical cardiac markers creatine kinase (CK), its isoenzyme MB (CK-MB), myoglobin, and troponin can play an important role: (1) the primary diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), (2) identification of patients suffering from unstable angina with minor myocardial damage (MMD) and consecutively increased risk for major cardiovascular events, and (3) assessment of coronary reperfusion after intravenous thrombolysis.	1.2735017483127842
MRSA/MRSE infections are a major problem in hospitals and although in orthopaedic units the incidence is low awareness of this problem is necessary.	1.0311745583286884
Once a MRSA strain has been isolated the strict use of the hygiene precautions has to be applied to avoid epidemic spread of the strain.	0.9984404102072804
The patient has to be isolated.	0.6624289517782167
The staff has to use gloves and gowns whilst treating the patient.	0.7480500112849627
A antimicrobiel hand wash solution has to be used after taking off the gloves and before leaving the isolation room.	0.9234771354082189
Patient and staff have to be informed about the pathogenity and the way of infection spread so that infection precaution rules are fulfilled.	0.9959501796509302
Antibiotics should only be used in clinically well defined cases and the overall use of antibiotics should be reduced to lower the incidence of MRSA/E isolates.	1.1605704693898053
The problems of an MRSA case and its successful treatment are demonstrated.	0.9003292533182488
A microphone constructed for implantation in the posterior wall of the auditory canal and a piezoelectric transducer serving as the main components of an implantable hearing aid were temporally implanted in five patients during middle ear surgery under local anesthesia.	1.0031058564017208
The microphone was positioned beneath the skin of the auditory canal such that it completely covered the microphone membrane.	0.8845206913407448
The vibratory element of the transducer was coupled to the malleus in four patients with normal ossicular chains and directly to the stapes in one patient with missing incus.	1.0781259247921602
The microphone and transducer were electrically connected with an external battery-driven signal amplifier.	0.8806687304217692
Speech material and music were presented in the operation room at a sound level of 65 dB SPL under free-field conditions.	0.9579557115026871
The patients had to estimate the quality of speech, music, and their own voice as well as the effects of bone-conducting noises.	1.3712093980005267
All patients were able to hear with the system.	0.7830732278992361
An intraoperative talk without vision contact was possible without any problems, as was understanding of numerals ("Freiburger Zahlentest").	1.1179296329740585
Perception of music was judged as "clear and undistorted with all broadband component."	0.8362358337178981
The estimation was also valid for one patient with a sensorineural hearing loss.	1.0532134680326863
One patient declared the music to be "a little of unnatural."	0.9004229977876778
Bone-conducted sound was estimated as normal in two patients, better than without an implant in one patient with sensorineural hearing loss, and "somewhat metallic" in another patient.	1.1966019681782738
Hearing the own voice was considered "normal" in two cases "monotonous" in one case, and "a little bit roaring" in another case.	1.2395055034241205
An amplification factor that can be technically realized in an implantable hearing aid was necessary for one of the patients with sensorineural hearing loss to perceive music at a pleasant volume.	1.0531056219597619
On the basis of this study, essential requirements for the construction of a fully implantable hearing aid are fulfilled.	1.265969451680173
We report a patient with metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) with a first manifestation of homicide.	1.2103335184164463
On admission the patient showed a hebephrenia-like syndrom with inappropriate affect, thought disorder and  behavioral changes.	0.8954242613609278
Magnetic resonance  tomography (MRT) findings suggested a  diagnosis of MLD, which was confirmed by a decreased activity of leucocyte arylsulfatase A and an excessive urinary sulfatide excretion.	1.1252955947062828
The cervical spondylotic myelopathy is the most frequent spinal dysfunction.	0.9464859536037286
Its spontaneous course is very variable, from progress to stagnation.	0.9719224642521783
This makes prognosis and decision-making difficult for conservative or operative treatment.	0.7965223722536449
The authors attempt to provide some basis for decision-making by observing the individual course of neural dysfunction, consideration of morphometric data and the use of functional scores.	0.9325248585712596
To advise a patient, the outcome of conservative and operative treatment as described in the literature has to be considered, as well as the possible complications.	1.291490983374396
The advantages and disadvantages of surgery from the anterior and posterior approach are discussed.	0.8762739172697439

Subject: In a 7;11 year old boy with trichotillomania (ICD-10 F63.3), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (ICD-10 F90.1), and subclinical minimal cerebral dysfunction, Methylphenidate (Ritalin) medication resulted in a remarkable improvement: unexspected interruption of trichotillomania with regrowth of hair.	1.1176759396593194
An essential feature of the known procedures for the analysis of the ECG signal is the splitting of the ECG into individual parameters which are subsequently processed in defined decision trees, neuronal networks or statistical procedures to diagnostic information.	0.995257768737803
The correctness of the diagnostic statements thus substantially depends on the suitable selection and the exact determination of the individual criteria.	1.0691152858562287
The analysis algorithm and the expert knowledge are closely linked due to the procedure.	0.8633109043866476
This paper presents a new procedure or the evaluation of signals of medical sensor systems by the example of the ECG.	1.0816281787332434
Unlike the methods used up to now, this procedure is not based on an ever more profound splitting of the ECG signal into individual features.	1.118002560910993
Furthermore, analysis algorithm and knowledge base are separated from each other.	1.2021871072278363
The consideration underlying the procedure is that two ECGs whose leads show identical or very similar signal patterns indicate identical or at least very similar cardiological diagnoses.	0.9321657869977924
As this assumption is the basis of medical experience, it should be possible to compare the signal patterns of the leads of an unknown ECG with those of the leads of the reference ECGs from a database and to draw conclusions for the diagnosis of the unknown ECG.	1.1610983990332087
For this purpose, those ECGs are searched in an ECG database whose leads show greatest agreement with the signal pattern of the unknown ECG.	0.8801439713331617
The function of the method was established with the aid of the ECG signal database CARDIODAT with 249 ECGs for the diagnostic groups: infarcts and healthy reference persons from a data inventory of 550 ECGs.	1.0261324184998113
It can be seen from the results that the presented procedure which is based on signal pattern recognition is a new approach to deriving diagnostic information from the ECG signal at least for the diagnostic group of myocardial infarcts.	1.2156401133789179
Purpose: The technical conditions, the optimized scanning protocols and the facilities of virtual endoscopy (VE) are presented in an overview.	1.1565953877200836
During a 4-week ambulatory cardiacc rehabilitation program, 262 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), 235 men and 27 women, 53.6+/-10.2 years, performed 30.5+/-2,9 exercise units.	1.1808809856812008
Before and after the rehabilitation program exercise, capacity was assessed by bicycle ergometry.	0.920910718896166
There was a significant (p<0.001) increase in the maximum exercise capacity at the end of the program (105.3+/-32.3 vs. 121.9+/-37.3 W).	1.1354868725153142
Physical work capacity on the 2.0 mmol lactate level improved (p<0.001) from 72.2+/-23.5 to 86.4+/-25.8 W, on the 2.5 mmol/l level (p<0.001) from 83.5+/-23.2 to 97.4+/-26.4 W, and on the 3.0 mmol/l level (p<0.001) from 93.1+/-23.0 to 106.6+/-26.1 W. Despite enhanced performance, heart rate remained unaltered on the 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 mmol/l lactate level.	1.1820983854640332
Furthermore, ergometric performance on predefined heart rate levels was significantly (p<0.001) increased: 85/min: from 56.0+/-24.1 to 65.8+/-24.5 W; 90/min: from 62.0+/-27.3 to 71.2+/-26 W; 95/min: from 67.2+/-26.4 to 77.5+/-27.6 W; 100/min: from 71.1+/-29.6 to 80.6+/-28.1 W; 105/min: from 69.8+/-26.2 to 81.9+/-28.2 W and 110/min: from 73.6+/-28.9 to 90.4+/-29.4 W. The results demonstrate that physical performance in patients with CAD was improved by our novel ambulatory cardiac rehabilitation program.	1.211613281157969
This improvement included an increase in maximum as well as endurance work capacity; furthermore, this increase was accompanied by a decrease in resting and exercise heart rates.	1.0171029022015776
The results demonstrate an absolute increase of physical performance, more importantly an increase of physical performance at defined lactate levels in the presence of unchanged heart rates mediated by the rehabilitation program.	1.0863921533663177
Thus, this increase was independent of motivational factors in the patients and/or the investigators during the re-exercise test.	1.261260318229625
On the contrary, our data demonstrate that it is based on an improvement of aerobic endurance capacity associated with a therapeutically beneficial significant decrease of heart rate for a defined workload.	1.1271883832956366
The effects were independent of pharmacological influences (e.g., -receptor antagonists).	1.0906146523854832
These findings are of clinical importance with respect to reduction of myocardial oxygen consumption in patients with CAD.	1.0844496506754493
Newborn screening programs for inborn errors of metabolism are well established in industrialized countries.	0.855144763067248
Missed cases may be not only due to errors in specimen collection and laboratory errors but also to failures in adequate follow up.	0.9052759152023366
We report the case of a now 4-year-old girl whose classical phenylketonuria was diagnostically missed in the course of follow-up procedures of a pathological screening result 1067 µmol/l 17,6 mg% phenylalanine.	1.0666227270043802
The separation of whole blood into components is the state-of-the-art in transfusion of allogeneic blood.	0.9377885655715353
The main reasons are the negative effects of the buffy coat and the need for FFP.	0.9293424391839868
Nevertheless, especially in Germany whole blood is being rejected more and more even as autologous blood.	1.2647672615781267
However, most of the negative effects of the buffy coat do not apply to autologous blood.	1.0074011995547096
Additionally, these patients usually do not develop coagulation disorders and therefore do not need plasma as a hemostatic component.	1.1174344683851005
On the other hand, separation into components of autologous blood leads to an increase of costs and to logistic problems that restrict autologous blood predeposit to a few institutions.	0.9319825193859622
Therefore, we have reviewed the literature in order to find a scientific basis for this.	1.3643185057106573
We analysed all articles listed by MEDLINE during the last 12 years that dealt with the quality of whole blood or red cell concentrates.	0.9576750466272036
In addition, all references were included that contributed relevant information to the topic.	1.1768699893907089
A total of 135 original articles, abstracts, reviews, letters or editorials were analysed that referred to standard preparations and storage media.	0.8775777962865032
In 48 papers the in vivo red cell survival was studied.	0.8144749370560483
28 of which fulfilled the prerequisites to be included into a meta-analysis.	0.9939840966294761
The following in vitro parameters were also evaluated: pH, potassium load of the units, ATP and DPG concentration of the red cells.	1.037404066525304
Whole blood (resuspended in CPDA-1) and red cell units (stabilized in CPDA-1 or additive solutions) with a different buffy coat or leucocyte content have comparable pH values and red cell 2,3-DPG and ATP concentrations at the end of the approved storage time.	0.9936735200566326
The potassium load of a whole blood unit appears to be higher than red cell concentrates, but this is to some extent caused by the higher plasma content of whole blood and is not thought to be a clinically relevant problem for patients receiving only a few units.	1.2236695248711165
A number of studies demonstrate that dependent upon the leucocyte content of a red cell unit, leucocyte metabolites and enzymes are released and accumulate during storage.	0.8548762310178383
A detrimental influence on the integrity of the red cell membrane was found in several in vitro studies.	1.1334004741672292
Nevertheless, a significant improvement in red cell survival by leucocyte reduction was detected by only one group.	1.3213095436246123
Undoubtedly, non-hemolytic febrile transfusion reactions (NHFTR) are generally caused by an antibody-antigen interaction due to the transfusion of allogeneic buffy coat.	0.995662320143024
On the other hand, there is some evidence that non-specific immunological mechanisms such as the release of histamine or cytokines are also capable of causing NHFTR.	1.0273489736593788
Thus, these reactions are expected to occur in autologous blood transfusion.	1.265963330109738
However, so far, there are no data about the frequency and severity of these reactions and whether they are more likely to emerge after transfusion of blood units with a particular preparation.	1.34044607978258
Blood transfusions can cause septic complications due to bacterial contamination of the transfused units.	0.7957040268236769
These fatal but rare complications may be reduced by pre-storage filtration of blood, but there is no indication that buffy coat reduction is effective.	1.0459027447264573
Three cases with septic complications have been reported after autologous transfusion, in two of which red cell concentrates (at least one was free of buffy coat) had been used.	1.318472176714893
Thus, there is no justification for the conclusion that the risk of septic complications is increased by transfusion of whole blood.	1.1689436914530915
After all, whole blood and red cell concentrates exhibit only minor differences in relevant in vitro parameters.	0.9593985915452967
Hence, a higher incidence of adverse effects following the transfusion of autologous whole blood compared to autologous red cell concentrations is unlikely.	1.0551681288923562
Therefore, the 24 h in vivo recovery is considered to be the most valid criterion to assess the quality of red cell preparations.	1.112844528422395
Physical therapy can support geriatric rehabilitation in contributing to better health status, mobility, and quality of life.	0.8329169387585135
However, the central focus of this contribution is not on illness-specific aspects of physical therapy but on power and stamina training.	1.0935608943827284
These two training methods are of special importance for geriatric rehabilitation since most patients are admitted due to related problems and these two methods do imply specific risk factors for the rehabilitation process.	1.1129381067049904
The spectrum of physical adaptation processes supported by power and stamina training is described and scientifically evaluated.	0.8809417294472437
Even in higher age groups positive training effects are possible.	0.7410125287547559
Adequate usage of these training methods contributes to increased competence and a minimization of risks in daily life.	0.8608000455183609
The arthroscopic extraarticular Bankart procedure tries to imitate the open Bankart procedure.	0.6380855255862828
An anterior-inferior transmuscular approach through the subscapular muscle permits to implant self-locking tacks into the anterior inferior third of the glenoid rim.	0.8859143849467122
The extraarticular location of the implants makes a superomedial capsular shift possible, if required.	1.05534981461301
A total of 257 arthroscopic repairs following traumatic recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation have been carried out between 1992 and 1996.	0.879118220462197
177 patients were treated only with bioabsorbable Suretac device.	0.9030240933226332
Clinical and radiological follow up was possible in 165 patients.	0.9896833854727585
According to the Rowe score 69,7 % were classified as excellent, 10,9 % as good, 9,7 % fair and 9,7 % poor.	1.2150415347184207
Postoperative complications: the recurrence rate was 9,7 %, allergic reactions representing a foreign body reaction to the synthetic material were seen in 5 cases (3 %) and a frozen shoulder in 6 cases 3,6 %).	1.186375759534691
61 % of the patients involved in overhead or contact sports returned to their preoperative sport activities.	1.0062102298169164
Contrast-enhanced 3D MR angiography permits comprehensive assessment of the arterial system in the chest, abdomen und lower extremities.	1.0140626971777593
The method combines intravenous bolus application of a non-nephrotoxic, paramagnetic, extracellular contrast agent with the acquisition of a fast 3D data set.	0.9260900986670468
High contrast between the vascular lumen and surrounding tissues, inherent three-dimensionality and the ability to collect image data in the chest and abdomen under apnea conditions all contribute to excellent image quality.	0.9768275551632731
Contrast-enhanced 3D MRA is being employed in many centers throughout the world for the evaluation of various arterial pathologies.	0.946175719516711
This review provides a technical overview and critically discusses the clinical applications in the chest, abdomen and lower extremities based upon the available literature and several clincial examples.	1.0289239719434038
The indications for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on prosthetic heart valve recipients remain critical.	0.8236573178733106
A generalized contraindication for MRI is doubtful.	0.6457453122266608
Some diagnostic questions such as interests in pathologies of the posterior cranial fossa, spinal abscesses, and internal derangements for the knee, strongly recommend the advantages of MRI versus all other radiological diagnostic techniques.	1.103827260818809
MRI can directly affect patients with prosthetic valves in three ways by: 1) movement or dislodgment of the prosthesis, 2) heating, and 3) arrhythmias induced by electric currents, and indirectly by distortion of the image and its subsequent misinterpretation.	1.1969734324315813
Present literature that concerns the safety considerations of current values appears to be incomplete.	0.7869778589395812
Therefore, a survey of twenty-five valve manufacturers with regard to compatibility, safety or contraindication for MRI on their respective prosthetic heart valves was performed in 1998.	1.1856656894902196
Those manufacturers who distribute most of the valves in Europe confirmed the safety of MRI.	0.9106996496658535
However, some gave their assurances based on inadequate data, or assigned all responsibility to the physician.	1.2135477860842883
Some companies did not give any assurance for MRI safety or failed to respond to our enquiry.	0.8363571570792617
Two valve manufacturers warned against performing MRI on certain prostheses.	0.6824553472218899
Based on our 1998 questionnaire, the technical issues, the clinical circumstances, the prerequisites and criteria for and the definition of safety standards for MRI on prosthetic heart valve recipients are presented in this paper.	1.2621457343582938
Argyrophilic grain disease (AGD) is a frequently occurring degenerative illness of the aging human brain.	1.1055936035554204
It is accompanied by progressive pathological alterations of the cytsokeleton which are traceable to an abnormal phosphorylation of the microtubule associated tau protein.	0.8081872585702272
Histologically, it is possible with the help of suitable staining techniques to identify pathognomonic spindle-shaped cellular inclusions (argyrophilic grains).	1.1356479056299338
These cellular inclusions display a typical cortical as well as subcortical distribution pattern.	0.8165917227750795
The goal of the present study is the retrospective evaluation of the clinical findings from 53 individuals with neuropathologically demonstrable AGD-related changes of the brain.	1.2253318585000879
Nearly one-half of the cases (49%) was classifiable as demented in accordance with DSM IV-criteria.	1.045299334769122
Moreover, the frequency of the dementia increased significantly in relation to the growing severity of the AGD-associated pathological cytoskeletal degeneration.	1.091208026957518
These results confirm the assumption that AGD can cause degenerative changes ranging from cognitive impairment all the way to dementia.	0.9100826196643736
They also underscore the necessity of further prospective studies pertaining to the clinical aspects of this still enigmatic disease.	0.9495416459476624
The major problems in the treatment of open fractures with high blood loss are hypothermia acidosis and coagulopathy.	0.9611329145446142
By improving the standards of polytrauma management and using massive transfusion systems, which should help to avoid those complications, the indication for primary limb salvage under hypovolemic shock conditions is greatly increased.	1.070064254986048
The following case of an grade 3 open fracture of the femur with severe soft-tissue damage, including vascular lesions, with consecutive massive transfusion, should demonstrate that the cardiac-respiratory system can still be stabilized, even if a surgical solution seems impossible.	1.2374564975731963
Annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma is mostly found in middle aged women in skin areas exposed to sunlight.	0.8123343940504719
Our 17-year-old female patient had a widespread reddish-brown lesion on the abdomen that met the histological criteria for annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma.	0.9653958225012963
However, the clinical findings and the localization were uncommon.	1.33171917250562
UV light was excluded as a trigger.	0.739525812189091
Other, still unknown, factors that might change antigenicity of elastic fibres must be considered.	0.9633243233039697
Spontaneous resolution suggests a transient influence of such factors.	0.7819493092733799
Differential diagnosis includes skin disorders with elastolysis; discrimination especially from mid-dermal elastolysis is not well defined.	0.8880810013909507
Traumatic instability of the sternoclavicular joint is a rare diagnosis.	0.9168653484397232
It is usually treated by different bandaging techniques without the possibility of early functional aftercare.	0.9150664808274406
In the period betweeen 1 January 1996 and 31 December 1998, a total of eight patients with unstable sternoclavicular joints requiring surgical treatment were treated with Balser plates.	1.109511044451797
The population comprised sevenanterior and one posterior dislocations.	0.636274806332368
A 81-year-old man presented with massive hemoptysis and dyspnea.	0.8195699620088627
Results of chest radiography and computer tomography were highly suspicious for a large right-sided tumor of the bronchus with impression of the right main bronchus.	1.0990992644389945
Because of clinical worsening the patient was transferred to our department of pulmonology.	1.0308764014470968
The patient died of unappeasable hemoptysis the next day.	0.8058600831950347
At autopsy we found a 2-cm-diameter tumor of the proximal trachea as the source of massive bleeding and blood aspiration.	1.1359827879532722
Histological examination confirmed the tumor to be an epithelioid angiosarcoma of the trachea, which was a primary as no other tumor manifestation was detected.	1.2253016371045693
The entity of epithelioid angiosarcoma as a primary tumor of the trachea, to our knowledge, has not yet been reported.	1.0734341377699286
The benefits of epidural analgesia are well known, but it is not well understood which types of urologic surgery benefit most from epidural analgesia.	1.0710179536137279
In this study, the effects and side effects of prolonged epidural analgesia are prospectively examined and analysed on 172 adult patients in three different operation groups.	1.058068479019849
An epidural infusion of local anaesthetic combined with an opioid and adrenaline was given for a period of 5-7 days.	1.2110185271587388
There was no difference between the groups with respect to the effectiveness of the analgesia and patients' perception of the treatment.	1.1688145600090223
Mobilization differed, as expected, between the groups, however even after the most major surgery (e. g. cystectomy with bladder substitution), mobilization was impressively unproblematic.	1.339291023821715
Retarded return of regular intestinal function after the transperitoneal operation and partly after lumbotomy compared with the extraperitoneal operation depended on which operation was performed and the amount of analgesia given.	0.9799321766205553
The side effects such as sedation, nausea and pruritis were conditional partly on the opiate and partly on the intervention.	0.8232032378732594
Up to 11 % showed slight muscular weakness of the lower limbs as a specific side effect of the local anaesthetic.	1.3405137743491888
Complications: One patient died of cerebral hypoxy due to an initially undetected subdural catheter placement complicated by severe pre-existent carotid stenosis.	1.0068452189413333
In four patients, the epidural analgesia had to be stopped because of catheter migration.	1.0802697341329022
There was no clinical evidence of hematoma, abscess or permanent neurological damage.	0.9120159266925562
Epidural analgesia works well in terms of analgesia, mobilization and patient satisfaction, bearing in mind the potential side effects and complications.	0.9365927359895221
It can be recommended for lumbotomy and long transperitoneal operations however not for extraperitoneal interventions in the lower abdomen such as radical prostatectomy.	1.0279390921162326
High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) provides excellent contrast between osseous structures, air and soft tissue in conjunction with high spatial resolution.	0.8635305937880088
Therefore, thin-section HRCT with bone window setting is the method of choice for the examination of the middle ear structures.	1.1388444997440246
The indications are acute and chronic inflammatory changes, cholesteatoma and tumor, the "postoperative middle ear", and malformations.	1.10133598454854
In most cases, HRCT enables differentiation between inflammatory changes, cholesteatoma, and tumor.	0.8160881186921177
The excellent depiction of subtle osseous details enables the identification of erosions of the ossicles or of the bony walls of the mastoid cells, of osseous defects of the tegmen, of the bony labyrinth, and of the tympanic course of the facial canal.	1.257576787147281
In addition, HRCT enables excellent depiction of reconstructions of the ossicles or prosthesis of the ossicles.	1.0669749906622183
Although HRCT is the first method of choice, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may provide additional information and lead to a more accurate diagnosis in some cases.	1.1104443079841433
This is explained by the excellent soft tissue contrast provided by MRI.	0.9008415177862267
In addition, MRI offers the possibility of using various pulse sequences and the administration of IV contrast material.	0.9921667406216812
Therefore, MRI may allow the differentiation between inflammatory changes, cholesteatoma, and tumor in those cases in which accurate diagnosis cannot be made by HRCT.	1.1812500974024875
The differentiation between a meningocele or meningoencephalocele and other entities such as tumors or cholesteatoma can be established by MRI.	0.8749165866715567
Furthermore, MRI can accurately depict cases of labyrinthitis or of neuritis of the facial nerve or of intracranial disease caused by middle ear processes, while this is not always possible by HRCT.	1.2549632069789138
Morbidity and mortality after emergency procedures in 105 patients with perforated colonic diverticulitis were evaluated in a retrospective study.	1.0276749156079088
In different stages of diverticulitis (Hinchey classification: I, 8.6 %; II, 14.3 %; III, 57.1 %; IV, 20.0 %) mortality was 12.4 %.	1.238275284103406
Preoperative sepsis syndrome with leucopenia and disturbed liver function, cardiac risk factors and obesity were independent prognostic factors in multiple logistic regression.	1.0432305975983907
Accompanied by immunosuppression the mortality rate remarkably increased to 33 %.	0.8189715092305748
The stage of peritonitis showed no influence on the prognosis.	0.8531060368106949
In multivariate analysis, surgical procedure (primary resection 12.4 %, Hartmann's procedure 61.9 %, non-resection procedures 25.7 %) showed influence only on increased general complications.	1.2003984438076274
The role of laparoscopic cholecystectomy on patients with histologically confirmed acute cholecystitis is still controversial.	0.9437251839708268
From January 1992 to December 1996, 228 cholecystectomies were performed for acute cholecystitis and a total of 104 patients were operated on conventionally and 124 patients underwent laparoscopic surgery.	0.966396322437458
In a prospective study we compared the conventional with the laparoscopic technique.	0.9560997212521107
The results indicated that in 19 patients (15.3 %) treated initially with the laparoscopic technique, a switch to laparotomy was required.	1.1634062206927394
The operating duration was lower for conventional cholecystectomy (75 min versus 95 min).	0.9661126020799559
However, surgical and nonsurgical complication rates were similar in both groups.	1.3069292411757762
The period of hospitalization was shorter in laparoscopic operations.	0.8842080937624004
According to these results we believe that laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with acute cholecystitis is a safe and effective procedure.	1.0269045525970024
The patients will benefit from the advantages of laparoscopic surgery without increased morbidity.	0.8830659748924035
The sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) is one of the most striking developments in the treatment of melanoma.	1.118199117497319
Since the first report by Morton et al.	0.9867458973054273
in 1992, the method has been refined, and its use has increased.	1.3010878784352797
Introduced as an alternative to elective lymph node dissection (ELND), it has rapidly made its way into clinical practice.	1.115535081075017
SLND allows precise pathologic staging through removal and analysis of a limited number of nodes (false-negative rate < 2 %).	1.0215349211918403
It distinguishes patients with clinically occult nodal disease from those with tumor-free regional basin who would not benefit from radical dissection.	0.9529935387180913
However, the SLND is still an experimental procedure with yet unproven utility.	1.0679632028612085
Although children are injured everyday through accidents, road traffic, leisure or sports activities, internal lesions of the knee joint due to the trauma are rare.	0.98922363786066
Diagnose and therapy follow rather empirical than analytical patterns.	0.6793057486598583
A retrospective, controlled study evaluates and recommends ways of treatment.	0.9083170774618898
Traumatic internal lesions of the knee where analysed in 76 children up to age 16.	0.9669683464985619
The pattern of injury changed with increasing age, the trauma remaining the same.	0.9849861605932184
Most common where injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).	0.6534030076798206
Main cause where sports activities.	0.5045729772561781
Operative treatment seems to be the appropriate treatment.	1.027659143967871
Osseous avulsions of the cruciates and collateral ligaments showed good results after transosseous refixation with a suture.	0.8356659756994956
Suturing of intraligamentous ACL-ruptures as well as patellar ligaments plasty showed unsatisfactory results.	0.7754384772023513
Secondary lesions due to instability of the knee where also observed in children.	1.0259504242666109
Children cannot self estimate the severity of the injury so subjective statements are insecure.	0.9150837443954487
Trauma, surgery, pain and immobilisation cause a marked malfunction of the senso-motor system which is effectively treated by physiotherapy.	1.0432089838931335
Malignant mixed Müllerian tumours (MMMT) are tumours of the female genital tract which rarely occur in extragenital sites.	0.9140178482552024
We report a case of a 46-year-old female with MMMT with primary occurrence in the greater omentum.	1.0666374044330178
Only 19 cases of primary extragenital manifestation of this tumour are described in the literature.	1.0131755914856417
The clinical appearance, diagnosis, therapy, histological evaluation and histogenesis are discussed.	0.8875039531666341
The publication of the CONSORT Statement was aimed at the improvement of the quality of research reports of randomized controlled clinical trials.	0.8613415953436246
It contains the most important standards of high quality research.	1.0475760882427394
Although originally meant for randomized studies only most aspects of this statement can be applied to other kinds of clinical studies.	0.901576254367351
The demand for minimally invasive techniques and more comfort for the patient is becoming higher and higher.	1.1469366450081266
In the region of the ankle joint, it is therefore ideal to use the arthroscope for pathology.	1.094992319282851
Indications for ankle joint arthroscopy are: soft tissue impingement, ligament instability, impingement in the syndesmosis, osteochondral lesions, loose bodies, arthrosis, and loose os trigonum of the talus.	0.9062873846171623
In the subtalar joint the indications are rupture of the ligaments, loose bodies, and synovitis with soft tissue impingement.	0.9435850456887915
A new indication is arthroscopically assisted arthrodesis of the talar and subtalar joint.	0.7512306394680842
The reported high incidence of complications, especially in terms of neurovascular lesions, can be avoided by an exact knowledge of anatomy and use of non-invasive distraction of the joint.	1.2054382774253842
Although alexithymia is found in patients with various somatic disorders, it remains unclear whether it is really related to organic disease - as proposed by the founders of the concept .[125].	1.1416758910534173
As the interplay between the experience of emotion and possible adverse effects on health is a fundamental tenet of psychosomatic medicine, alexithymia remains an interesting concept to be further explored, especially concerning (1) possible pathways linking emotion to physical illness and (2) the neurobiologic basis of emotional information processing.	1.05953164833781
Compared to the intense international discussion on the subject, in Germany there are still many doubts concerning alexithymia: while some clinicians question the validity of the whole concept, psychiatric and psychosomatic researchers seem unsure about alexithymia's role in their search for a physiological basis to the link between emotion and physical disease.	1.1142295359565821
Our review deals with the empirical literature concerning that possible association and tries to tie in their data with modern, neurobiologically founded insights into emotional information processing within the brain.	0.789649790619417
In the etiopathology of tension type headache, vascular and autonomic disorders are discussed.	0.9592504041527218
Fifteen patients with chronic tension type headache according to the criteria of the IHS were investigated using the TCD-ergometer-test - a method used to evaluate the myogenic mechanism of cerebrovascular autoregulation - and the results were compared with the findings in fifteen healthy control subjects.	1.3027857667819276
An immunohistochemical and morphometric study was performed on bone marrow biopsies in 604 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) to compare morphological and clinical features and to evaluate effects of interferon (IFN) and chemotherapy.	1.3232835634129692
Following morphometry significant correlations were calculated between number of CD61+ megakaryocytes, including their precursors with fiber density.	0.9713519153460493
This finding is in line with the close functional relationship between megakaryopoiesis and fibroblasts regarding the complex pathomechanism of myelofibrosis.	0.8508909217367192
The latter was observed in about 28% of patients already at diagnosis.	1.2144894450050754
In a similar way, the frequency of CD68+ macrophages was correlated with the amount of Ret40f+ nucleated erythroid precursors, implicating an involvement of this cell lineage in iron turnover, hemoglobin synthesis, and degradation of the expelled nuclei from normoblasts.	0.9582214325367477
The (-D-galactosyl residue-expressing) Pseudo-Gaucher cells were detectable in 30% of pretreatment specimens.	1.1886328934880832
Moreover, significant associations were calculable between reduction in erythropoiesis or increase in fibers with clinical features such as hemoglobin level, percentages of myelo- and erythroblasts in the peripheral blood, and spleen size.	1.0273139045340451
These variables are in keeping with more advanced stages of CML.	0.8107989634890501
Based on our morphometric evaluations, a classification into three different histological subgroups: granulocytic, megakaryocytic, and myelofibrotic was carried out.	1.1141557690139166
This simplified staging system was correlated with corresponding sets of hematological data.	0.7529903799624218
Sequential biopsies in 173 patients with monotherapy by IFN, hydroxyurea (HU), or busulfan (BU) revealed a fibrogenic effect of IFN in contrast to a fiber-reducing property of HU.	1.0673777766227517
The dynamics of myelofibrosis and changes of major cell lineages during treatment were readily demonstrable by calculating corresponding indices.	0.8698303384153092
These included the ratios between quantitative differences of corresponding variables at repeated examinations and time.	0.7797284584386714
Thus, in patients with complete hematological remission following IFN administration, regeneration of erythropoiesis was found to be accompanied by an increase in the total number of CD68+ macrophages, including activated subpopulations.	1.0588621799032003
Histological subgroups showed a transition from a (nonfibrotic) granulocytic and megakaryocyte pattern to the myelofibrotic subtype in about 40% of patients.	0.9655683628217125
This change was opposed to a numerical reduction in the myelofibrotic subtype which occurred in 17 patients (36%), but predominantly in those under HU therapy.	1.0066790620961958
In conclusion, the striking heterogeneity of bone marrow features in CML warrants a careful morphological evaluation of trephine biopsies and appropriate means of processing to achieve relevant correlations with clinical data and, thus, allows a more elaborate insight into the dynamics of the disease process.	1.1263196026512898
Computer-aided analysis of the results of the intrathecal infusion test using our mathematical computation leads to simplification of this investigation, and therefore normal pressure hydrocephalus is more easily diagnosed.	1.1807686201080618
Simultaneous measurement of resistance and compliance during a single investigation allows the exertion of the patients to be minimized.	1.134615317809289
In contrast to classic methods it is not necessary that the ICP reaches a plateau.	1.1444687291920417
Our mathematical method diverges with the description of a pressure-dependent slope of the function for the resistance from the static examination models.	0.9247324829501369
For that we are able to take the non-linearity of the cerebrospinal fluid resorption into consideration.	0.8151104564270318
The intrathecal infusion test is a reliable diagnostic method for measuring resistance and compliance in patients suspected of having normal pressure hydrocephalus.	0.9644492408336169
Primary medullary nailing of femoral fractures is burdened by the risk of central and pulmonary complications in patients with polytrauma, especially in conjunction with craniocerebral or thoracic trauma.	1.108497720122799
This also applies to unreamed medullary nailing.	0.5720566831271655
Primary treatment with external fixation necessitates secondary surgery with an altered procedure, the timing of which is not predictable.	1.078829445293932
Plate osteosynthesis with anatomical repositioning of the fragments and rigid fixation is a technically demanding procedure, but can lead to fragment necrosis due to fragment denudation.	1.1049636884782943
In a prospective study conducted from 1 September 1994 to 30 June 1996 on 17 polytraumatized patients (average ISS: 30 points), simple femoral stem fractures (A-1 to B-3 of the AO-classification) were stabilized by elastic plate osteosynthesis using biological technique.	1.188680472371785
While cautiously preserving the periosteal and muscle connections to the bone, a plate is inserted as a bridge without any interfragmentary compression.	0.9372748571768318
At least two to four holes are left free in the center of the plate.	0.8660473712922366
This allows micro-movements in the fracture gap without the risk of material fatigue.	0.9244546926917877
All of the fractures were immediately stabilized on the day of the accident.	0.9175455830120309
Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is an x-linked disorder of the urea-cycle.	0.8998723427323413

Coumarin necrosis is a rare, but life-threatening complication when administering coumarin in oral anticoagulant therapy.	0.9705494751896373
Predestined areas are the breasts, hips, gluteal region, thighs or lower legs.	0.8106232884080273
Thrombotic tendencies, such as congenital or acquired changes in coagulation, lead to a higher risk of coumarin necrosis.	1.027592045838606
A direct, toxic effect of coumarin on the capillary system may also play a role.	1.015633088464304
Although the incidence is only 0.01-0.1%, lethality lies at 15%, the knowledge of this rare complication is important in order to begin with a proper treatment punctually.	1.323558079872977
The therapy of choice is early fibrinolysis.	0.8680108193522649
With special emphasis on pediatric aspects, the presently available data on the effectiveness and safety or specific immunotherapy with house dust mite extracts are reviewed.	1.0282135852055598
In addition to antiinflammatory treatment and allergen avoidance, specific immunotherapy offers an approach to the treatment of bronchial asthma in those patients sensitized against house dust mites.	1.0988278018259703
Controlled studies of specific immunotherapy against house dust mites show decreased symptom-medication scores and positiv effects on some lung function parameters.	0.888500869104692
Therapeutic efficacy appears to be better in pediatric patients.	0.9380095900325449
Severe side effects seem to be rare, but are more common in patients with chronic airway obstruction, in infants and with rush-immunotherapy.	1.3271992408417081
From January 1996 untill February 1997 6,376 patients were treated by our group with PTCA and 3,859 (60.5%) received one or several stents.	1.1756072621821385
An angiographic follow up was achieved in 63% of the patients with 1,267 experiencing restenosis (32.8%).	1.1499036311448916
Of those beeing treated with re-PTCA 302 were randomly selected for further analysis.	0.8562894617006371
In-stent-restenosis was treated with rotablator in 8 patients (2.7%), with eximer laser in 21 (7.0%) and with another stent in 48 patients (15.9%).	1.2151889458389167
225 patients (74.4%) of this subselection were treated with balloonangioplasty only.	1.1815198297904328
It is not clear whether public health insurance will cover post exposure prophylaxis (PEP), whereby the question of costs being covered by private health insurance companies is not taken into consideration here.	1.0784019937346072
Regulations concerning prevention (§ 20 SGB V), precautionary medical services (§ 23 SGB V) and health examination (§ 25 SBG V) offer no legal basis for cost coverage.	1.1199321098168669
PEP is patient care in the sense of § 27 SGB V. However, this particular treatment has not yet been adapted into public health insurance financial guidelines because the federal committees have not yet made appropriate recommendations.	1.1282851152209352
This should be achieved soon, in order to eliminate legal ambiguities in this area.	0.9850989712074345
The principles of the so called "new methods of examination and treatment" legal construct may support cost coverage liability.	1.1084492575515956
On the whole, however, German-Austrian recommendations concerning indication and use of PEP must be formulated more concretely and unambiguously.	1.013041676214429
If a doctor, in the case of an indication according to the German-Austrian recommendations, does not prescribe PEP, this would probably not be malpractice, because there are still many scientific questions to be answered.	1.2892972479836367
To clarify the functional mechanism of the Esmarch device in the treatment of sleep apnea, its effect on muscle activity during sleep was studied electromyographically with and without the appliance at the inferior head of the lateral pterygoid muscle, the genioglossal muscle, and the masseter muscle in 15 patients with sleep apnea syndrome.	1.275932429572252
During the obstructive apnea the muscles showed significantly lower amplitudes than before the apnea.	0.8609702120056827
No significant decrease in the amplitude was observed during the central apnea, but, after the obstructive and central apnea, significantly higher amplitudes were seen than beforehand.	1.2419304116133538
The amplitudes rose after the placement of the appliance, and the amplitudes of the genioglossal and lateral pterygoid muscles during obstructive apnea increased significantly after the insertion of the appliance.	1.1345181908978839
The results suggest that the device can activate the masticatory and tongue muscle activity and indicate that the muscles activated with the appliance can prevent obstruction in the oropharynx.	0.967707232066098
The Esmarch device not only helps avoid obstruction by mandibular protraction, but also affects function by activating the muscles.	1.0032740967363305
The analysis of the delinquency bringing disordered offenders into a hospital order institution reveals a lot of very conscious and well organized behavior during the criminal activity.	0.8830218845954676
This must be taken into account in therapy and prognosis.	0.9585190671084938
The prevalence in paediatric obesity is increasing in many industrialised and developing countries and growing to a world-wide medical and socio-economic problem.	0.8375607368903449
In a recent report of the WHO the world-wide epidemic of obesity was addressed as a problem of highest priority.	1.0470787956446488
Inadequate long-term results of weight reduction in children and adolescents and the increasing socio-economic burden to the health systems, as well as the high grade of persistence of obesity aggravate the problem and demand primary prevention efforts.Future directions of primary prevention measures could be the time of onset of obesity, the "early adiposity rebound", intrauterine malnutrition, weight gain during infancy, low energy expenditure in infants, familial adiposity, composition of food and modification of fat intake.	1.2029872388752099
Despite advances in the field of orthopedic surgery, necrosis of the femoral head still remains a serious problem.	0.8327296128723288
Under normal conditions magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) is the gold standard for early diagnosis.	1.1779577570842235
Because of magnetic interference, this technique is not applicable in the diagnosis of posttraumatic necrosis with internal fixation, however.	1.2081333220828014
This seems to be an ideal indication for ossovenography: contrast medium is injected into the femoral head under X-ray control and the venous flow is documented.	1.215287212395518
Furthermore, it is possible to get histological samples from suspicious areas.	1.215055497231793
Ossovenography was performed in 12 patients and the results were compared with histological samples.	1.2399890264158835
In every patient in whom necrosis of the femoral head was diagnosed by ossovenography (91.6 %), we also found necrosis on histological examination.	1.1657033533051608
In one patient in whom physiological flow was found, there was a corresponding absence of necrosis in the histological sample.	1.1405278983852134
There were no complications during ossovenography.	1.064324422107371
The results suggest that ossovenography is a promising and reliable method for early diagnosis of necrosis of the femoral head in the presence of internal fixation devices.	1.100360312322435
To evaluate patients with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death the analysis of ventricular late potentials, heart rate variability and baroreflexsensitivity is helpful.	1.0536093262458204
However, the prediction of malignant arrhythmic events cannot be performed with sufficient accuracy.	1.0359594370161913
For a better identification of high risk patients other methods are necessary.	0.9798149413684433
In this study the impact of the chemoreflexsensitivity for the prediction of ventricular tachyarrhythmias was investigated.	0.9430747668091236
The results of a retrospective study concerning percutaneous catheter drainage of 62 intra-abdominal abscesses in 60 patients were demonstrated, including the procedure and complications.	1.2988036075335856
For the first access a thin needle was used to perform an aspiration biopsy under sonographic control.	1.0720842061350782
We placed a pigtail or van Sonnenberg catheter by Seldinger or trocar technique into the abscesses.	0.6499155971759445
The primary success rate of percutaneous drainage was 85 %.	0.8398386509651239
Complications occurred in 6.4 % of the cases with a mortality of 0 %.	1.2076364193167097
This method is an acceptable alternative to surgery for many patients.	0.9833961925740443
Ultrasound-guided percutaneous catheter drainage is the method of choice for uncomplicated abscesses, especially in the critically ill patient.	0.9845956775016312
Acute brain tissue damage or systemic illnesses can lead to local or diffuse brain edema and raised intracranial pressure (ICP).	0.8394634931086215
It is obvious that in all brain injuries additional factors (metabolic disturbances, hypoxia and hypercapnia, circulatory instability) aggravating brain edema and impairing recovery of viable neurons have to be treated immediately and consequently.	0.9744612565066613
Medical therapies for further treatment of elevated ICP depend not only on their mode of action and side effects but although on the specific illness.	1.1080216591171874
The different etiology and pathogenesis of developing brain edema and ICP elevation with either more local or generalized extension explain the different success of medical treatment strategies in severe head trauma compared to middle cerebral artery territory or complete hemispheric infarction.	1.012751611058033
An algorithm for treatment of postischemic brain edema in acute hemispheric infarction was developed.	0.9044257826117872
In an investigation of infection control methods for respirator systems in 89 randomly selected German intensive care units as a part of the NIDEP study (Nosocomial Infections in Germany - Surveillance and Prevention), it was found that respirator systems were exchanged daily in about 50% of the intensive care units.	1.1886857797255954
However, Craven et al.	1.2420825132278002
found that changing circuits (including tubing and exhalation valve and the attached humidifier) every 24 h rather than every 48 h was independently associated with the occurrence of nosocomial pneumonia.	0.962778639071975
On the basis of these results and recent studies, the current situation in the literature was analyzed in order to make recommendations for exchanging ventilator circuits.	1.3443572832015391
The key function of the uterine cervix to maintain pregnancy is biochemically characterized by an increased synthesis of proteins (e.g., collagen), proteoglycans, and glycoproteins (e.g., fibronectin) as well as by well-defined interactions between these components of the extracellular matrix.	1.1402491632363387
In contrast to the slow phase of the cervical ripening process in late pregnancy, dilatation of the cervix during parturition requires the rapid formation and action of catabolic enzyme systems, leading mainly to collagen degradation and changes in its architecture but also to degradation of other fundamental matrix proteins.	1.1262391456048066
It has been suggested that an increased production of tumor necrosis factor- and interleukin-1, for example, induces an increased expression of endothelial adhesion molecules with subsequent extravasation of granulocytes in the cervical stroma and that the chemotaxis and degranulation of these cells within the stroma is triggered by an increase in interleukin-8 concentration.	1.0523216920694907
The proteases (e.g., matrix metalloproteinase-8) released after degranulation of neutrophilic granulocytes encounter an already destabilized (loss of decorin) collagenous fiber network.	0.8498804600688954
The clinical consequences of this basic research is to develop new concepts in a more causal treatment of cervical pathology during pregnancy and parturition.	1.0906246404447983
Objectives: The involvement of cytokines in degeneration and inflammation of human tissue is well established.	0.9951420676804058
Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a major agent in the pathophysiology of periarticular bone resorption in rheumatoid arthritis and in osteoporosis.	1.0810875292085618
Because the use of recombinant cytokines and growth factors is limited due to their short half lives, techniques are needed to get a permanent release of these therapeutic proteins.	1.1043426689503177
The rational of this study was to show that retroviral transduction of human osteoblastic cells is possible in vitro using the marker gene LacZ and the potentially therapeutic gene encoding for human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein (IL-1Ra).	1.0861431260156609
Different transduction techniques were combined to improve the rate of transduction in vitro.	0.9471409798273569
Methods: Osteoblastic cells were isolated from human spongious bone and cultured in vitro.	1.0175433633010371
The -galactosidase (LacZ) gene and the cDNA of IL-1Ra were introduced into the isolated cells by retrovirus mediated gene transfer.	0.9886195070753854
LacZ activity was determined by Xgal staining, IL-1Ra was measured quantitatively by ELISA.	1.0026702931838676
Results: The transfer of retroviral IL-1Ra led to IL-1Ra expression of 8614 to 10089pg IRAP/50000 cells/48h.	0.9849723224733324
By combining different techniques to improve transduction, the X-gal staining established a rate of transduction of 60%.	0.9869732461424482
Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that retroviral transduction of human osteobalstic cells is possible in vitro, and leads to high levels of the synthesized transgene product.	0.9378386468002377
The rate of retroviral transduction can be accelerated in vitro.	0.8020970898037981

We report a 72-year-old patient who developed an isolated bilateral hypoglossal nerve paralysis following head trauma with complete recovery after three months.	1.0702595590444732
Since the CT scan did not show any fractures of the posterior skull base, we discuss a traction nerve injury as a possible mechanism.	1.3046407603199754
Injuries of the colon and retroperitoneum are rarely observed after blunt abdominal trauma and occur in about 5 - 20 % of the patients.	1.0806477355695665
The majority of complications are due to initial misdiagnoses and a delay in treatment.	0.9260820561587692
Lesions of the pancreas and duodenum are the most frequent diagnoses in the retroperitoneal space, while major vascular traumata or urogenital injuries are rare.	1.1770269494764596
Retroperitoneal hematoma are most likely due to pelvic fractures.	0.73628716355481
The survival of patients after colon or retroperitoneal injuries depends on the severity of concomitant organ trauma, the time of diagnosis, and a situation-adapted therapeutic strategy.	1.279725644500385
The treatment of the typical caudal retroperitoneal hematoma following pelvic fractures is conservative in most patients.	1.041250831753371
Early pelvic stabilization, e. g., with external fixation, is recommended in these patients.	1.057693998818462
Central retroperitoneal hematoma in the supra - or inframesocolic space should be treated surgically, as major vascular injuries are most likely in these patients.	1.2552925535295336
Duodenal or pancreatic injuries need surgical exploration in the majority of patients; the therapeutic spectrum ranges from simple sutures to pancreatoduodenal resection.	1.0020240802305869
The treatment of colon injuries depends on the degree of peritonitis and the severity of concomitant trauma.	0.8870218757975437
Early diagnosed injuries are suitable for primary repair, while deviation stomata or a Hartmann procedure with or without resection should be offered to patients with delayed diagnoses, peritonitis, or severe concomitant diseases.	1.019460240560863
Long-lasting procedures should be abandoned in the emergency situation; in these severe cases, laparotomy should be aimed towards primary "damage control" and followed by definite surgery after stabilization of the patient.	1.1927396802067272
Surgery of the great veins inevitably began with the surgical treatment of injuries, often involving the femoral vein.	1.1262539764070862
Because of the famous case presented by Roux in 1813, the prevailing opinion until almost the end of the nineteenth century was that ligation of the vein made death inevitable, but that the only way to control severe hemorrhaging from a vein was to ligate the femoral artery.	1.059230578852206
Zaufal's principle (1880) consisted in the ligation and resection of great veins of the body and limbs in order to prevent sepsis in suppurative processes.	1.1020661005156456
This surgical method was still being used in the first half of the twentieth century in patients with perforated appendicitis or puerperal fever.	1.031340915507763
In the limb, the congestion induced in the vein had a positve effect on the healing process.	0.9307685438878044
The surgical treatment of leg and pelvic deep vein thrombosis was initially (1931) aimed at achieving decompression in compartment syndromas.	0.8755318479052423
The first thrombectomy was performed in 1937, but several operations with a successful outcome were reported at the 61st annual meeting of the German Society of Surgery in the following year.	1.214422060603584
Bilateral glomus jugulare tumors are rare.	0.6078891459006617
However, their treatment should preserve not only the function of the facial nerve but also the caudal cranial nerves and the middle ears in order to avoid bilateral hearing losses.	1.2936887528366448
Further, venous cerebral drainage has to be ensured in order to avoid cerebral hypertension and hemorrhagic infarction after bilateral jugular ligations.	1.028216823176739
In the case presented bilateral glomus jugulare tumors required super-selective angiography and embolization.	1.0810638088705107
Complete tumor removal on both sides was then possible by a transmastoid-transcervical approach without any further functional deteriorations.	0.9429032660250736
Middle ear function was preserved on both sides by temporary ventral translocation of the posterior wall of the auditory meatus.	0.8777905380982653
As the sigmoid sinus and internal jugular vein had been ligated during initial previous surgery, venous drainage was tested one year later by angiography and compression of the remaining internal jugular vein.	1.0207329560074223
A sufficient collateral circulation was found and permitted surgery on the second side.	0.9304743678857621
Intoxication is the monotone reaction of the CNS to consumed psychoactive substances.	0.8235182319414223
Intoxication-like conditions may also occur without taking drugs.	0.8899495716101472
We then use the term "ecstasy".	0.7419913653199296
Intoxication can follow typical or atypical course.	0.581786485524296
The main symptoms are disturbances of consciousness and orientation and additionally changes of mood, affect, drive and initiative, train of thought and self-control.	0.922455142772136
The diagnosis of intoxication differs from the diagnosis of psychosis because the latter continues its own course, occurs in the absence of psychoactive substances in the organism and always lasts longer than an intoxication.	0.9623952266273195
In a meta-analysis of 69 prospective and retrospective studies, we investigated the value of various surgical techniques in the treatment of lumbar disk herniations.	1.1321221809334687
Androgenetic hair loss is the most frequent reason for the topical application of hair-growth-promoting agents.	1.0253163851254483
Such preparations should arrest or even reverse androgen-induced hair follicle regression as well as prolonging the hair cycles, especially of the shortened anagen phase, and thus protect from increased hair loss.	1.0137366686199158
True evidence of drug effects on hair growth is problematic, since trichograms, the method chiefly applied by the manufacturers, fail to reveal every factor involved in the follicular activity, especially the duration of anagen stage.	1.168834948298022
For example, an increase in the anagen rate does not always reflect a lengthening of the anagen stage, but may also be due to shortened hair cycles.	1.0751889284462681
Accordingly, drug effects on hair growth should be investigated by methods that analyse the cell cycle kinetics.	1.1164433829101268
For this approach DNA-flowcytometry of the outer root sheath in plucked anagen hairs and of complete anagen hair bulbs taken by micropreparative techniques from scalp biopsies offers a reproducible method for quick and reliable evaluation of hair growth.	0.8639041583300178
The calcaneus pseudathrosis is rarly seen in clinical workday and we coundnit find any case be reported.	0.7987839593948265
In two casese the authors present the diagnosis and therapie of a non-union after a calcaneus fracture.	0.9633537432350476
The authors point especially at anatomical characteristics and biomechanical reasons and their meaning for aetiology of pseudathrosis after a calcaneus fracture.	0.8333158761745093
A general review of the results and technique of intraarterial chemotherapy in cases of breast cancer is given.	1.238791547490848
The remission rate for untreated primary tumors is nearly 100%, for completely treated local relapses approximately 70%.	1.100575488124352
The complication rate is quite low using an intraarterial well-tolerated cytostatic agent such as mitoxantrone.	0.9675621266830744
However, thromboembolism of the vertebral artery facing the internal mammary artery may occur.	1.2056801048267114
The indication for intraarterial chemotherapy should always be set by an interdisciplinary board.	0.881032884239762
In the country city of Ansbach, Germany all cases of varicella-zoster virus infection seen by dermatologists, pediatricians and general practitioneers were registered over a period of 16 months, from February 1992 until May 1993.	1.0847483516411973
152 patients were clinically diagnosed with herpes zoster and 437 patients with chickenpox.	0.8494735871763489
The population-based incidence of zoster infections was 22.6 per 10,000 inhabitants per year, while the incidence of chickenpox was 42.4.	1.0475793570806269
There was a slight predominance of male patients with zoster.	1.0314815607006436
There was also a marked influence of age and sex, on the localization of the involved nerve segments.	1.0971994239350633
Zoster was seen in patients of all ages but there was a clear predominance in older patients.	1.2173189692134847
The peak of the disease occurred in the eighth decade.	1.30248095463916
In patients with chickenpox, the sex ratio was equal.	1.0500539562172992
The disease typically occurs in children and we observed a predominance of the cases in the first decade.	1.3097857297004323
Paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes (PNS) are rare disorders of the nervous system that cannot be ascribed to metatastases or to destruction of vital systemic organs by the tumor or its treatment.	0.9821603431864241
Most frequently, PNS occur in association with small-cell lung, breast or ovarian carcinomas.	0.8876705864388688
The most frequent PNS is Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, which at the same time has the highest predictive value concerning an underlying carcinoma.	1.104519665254769
PNS have been classified mostly under anatomical aspects but now are increasingly categorized according to specific antibodies.	0.8704444356902209
In certain neurologic syndromes (sensible and autonomic neuropathy, cerebellitis, limbic encephalitis, Opsoclonus-Myoclonus syndrome, Stiff-man syndrome, neuromyotonia, subacute amaurosis) specific autoantibodies are highly predictive for a neoplasm.	0.9028767532967814
Pathogenic relevance of these autoantibodies has been demonstrated only for antibodies against (1) voltage gated calcium channels (VGCC) in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, (2) voltage gated potassium channels (VGKC) in neuromyotonia, and (3) recoverin in cancer associated retinopathy.	1.0378230375736317
The present article deals with the neurological symptoms of PNS, associated tumors, and the relevance of specific antibodies for the diagnosis and pathogenesis of PNS.	1.320804338401257
Ewing's sarcoma is a very rare tumor which has, however, attracted much oncological interest since the dramatic improvement of its prognosis under chemotherapy.	0.9960885490171454
Its histogenesis has been discussed controversially for a long time, including a possible origin in immature reticulum, myogenous, endothelial and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells.	1.1527470526996322
Repeated reports have also suggested a possible neuroectodermal genesis.	0.8205159642254827
Convincing arguments, however, have only been brought forward during recent years, since it was found that Ewing's sarcoma and malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumor share a common chromosome translocation 11;22.	1.100143247933943
In the meantime this hypothesis has been strengthened by numerous cell biological analyses.	0.8410205822630328
There seems to be no clear border between Ewing's sarcoma and malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumors with definite neural differentiation.	0.8212746065528584
Histological differential diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma has been improved by immunohistological methods.	0.9319488783446602
In most cases, they can be distinguished from lymphoma (leucocyte common antigen, B and T markers) and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (muscle specific actin, desmin) without problems.	1.1545927881032994
Apart from that, it is possible nowadays to obtain antibodies against the MIC 2-protein, which is preferably expressed in Ewing sarcoma.	1.2360895900145807
The diagnostics of Ewing's sarcoma and the malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumor have considerably been enriched by the fact that the specific chromosome translocation t(11;22) can be proved molecular biologically.	1.0058873251819913
In contrast to the cytogenetic evidence, it is not necessary to establish cell cultures.	1.289195891057607
Contrast enhanced (CE) magnetic resonance angiography affords angiographic depiction of extended vascular territories with high quality and diagnostic value.	0.9794102151813823
A prerequisite is the fast acquisition of a three-dimensional gradient-echo data set during the injection of a bolus of a T1-shortening contrast agent.	0.9345806297967212
We describe the dependence of the quality of CE-MRA on technical parameters of different MR-scanners and consider some fundamental facts and practical guidelines concerning the contrast agent injection.	0.9345573833744972
The present study gives a survey of radiological findings after surgical treatment of laryngeal and pharyngeal carcinomas, whereby the surgical procedures and the localisation of tumours found special consideration.	1.131640518665752
Owing to advances in adjuvant therapy, the outlook for patients with primary malignant bone tumors has improved dramatically in recent decades.	0.9412107168248963
This applies both to improved survival and to increased limb salvage rates.	0.9271579822319597
The diagnostic strategies and a staging system for malignant bone tumors are outlined.	1.105759501320282
Technical aspects of the standard limb salvage procedures, such as Tikhoff-Linberg resection at the shoulder, internal hemipelvectomy, proximal and distal femur resection and rotation plasty are presented.	1.011674948503691
The use of soft tissue procedures such as flaps and the use of modular implant systems has reduced the complication rates of limb salvage procedures.	0.919984236080698
In the future we hope to further improve prognosis and quality of life for such patients by the application of risk-adapted strategies for chemotherapy and surgery.	1.1602646391690365
In 10-30 % of cases, locoregional recurrence is accompanied by distant metastasis; a further 25 % develop distant metastasis within the year after diagnosis of recurrence.	1.0866228664380366
In treatment of recurrent tumor in the thoracic wall, axillary or supraclavicular disease surgery plays a major role.	0.9253423055052875
Since - another long-lasting courses occur even in the metastatic situation, recurrence is not an infrequent event, and therapy then needs a multidisciplinary approach.	1.2156793456099293
Surgical techniques such as local, myocutaneous or omental flaps and mesh graft transplantation are used to cover large defects after tumor resection.	0.8673577362431718
Additional and innovative modalities are combined in the management of this complex problem: locoregional or systemic chemotherapy, topical application of chemotherapy, certain radiation regimens and in otherwise resistant tumors the experimental use of photodynamic laser therapy (PDT).	0.9701753676698824
The most important goal hereby is to restore or at least maintain organ function and quality of life.	0.9613139543828582
In acute osteomyelitis of childhood a rapid diagnosis and initiation of antibiotic therapy is necessary in order to prevent late sequelae.	1.0452888846781485
Thus, diagnostic imaging plays a crucial role.	1.2383538405068149
If acute osteomyelitis is suspected in a child, imaging starts with conventional radiography in order to exclude other differential diagnoses.	1.09183679361069
This is followed by sonography for the purpose of diagnosing a subperiosteal abscess or joint fluid from which the causative organism could be isolated.	0.9502277175788844
If the diagnosis is unclear, the next step should be either MRI or 99m Tc-MDP bone scan, depending on the possibility of clinical localization and the site of the suspected lesion.	1.0778775996917145
MRI is superior to bone scan in depicting the exact anatomy, which is extremely important in spinal osteomyelitis and preoperatively.	1.0704963344611893
The bone scan can show the whole skeleton in one examination and should be favored if there is no definite localization or in suspected multifocal osteomyelitis.	0.9888543038811849
Rarely scintigraphy with labeled white blood cells is indicated.	0.7048677592438881
The 67 Ga scan, however, should not be used in children because of the high level of radiation exposure.	1.3172709115006274
The different imaging modalities are described in detail and an imaging diagnostic workup is outlined.	0.9354354288307107
In spite of all interdisciplinary efforts and functionally oriented operation procedures, there are still unsatisfying results in the treatment of cleft lip and palate (CLP) patients.	1.049699039830573
Secondary corrections involve upper lip, nose, and palate (fissures).	0.9361238825250013
In some cases, it is necessary to reposition the complete maxilla.	0.9362345758925796
Finally, there are indications for speech improving measures and total septorhinoplasties.	1.357948960856437
Dental treatment can be brought to a positive end by means of implant-borne prosthodontic work.	0.9729440162476762
In this paper, some of the anatomical and physiologic conditions and surgical procedures are described, which may serve as a basis for a functionally orientated treatment of sequelae after primary CLP care.	1.2118331398590878
Damage to the respiratory system caused by inhalation of toxic products of combustion and the subsequent development of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the main lethal factors in burns patients.	1.0079427387889377
Treatment with exogenous surfactant is one of the therapeutic options.	1.0404539326843574
However, no clinical reports have yet been published about this therapy.	1.2334407055374332
We report on two patients with burn injuries of second to third degree affecting 42% and 48% respectively of the total body surface plus inhalation injury complicated by ARDS.	1.128728736216813
Both patients were treated with bovine surfactant (Alveofact).	0.9358523835958525
The therapeutic effects on oxygenation and pulmonary function were monitored.	0.9675682969901803
Intrabronchial application of surfactant by bronchoscopy during exhaustive conventional mechanical ventilation resulted in improved gas exchange with an increase in arterial O2 pressure (paO2); inspired O2 concentration (FiO2) was lowered and there was an improvement in lung compliance.	1.0062474700901098
Both patients survived this critical situation.	0.6287017471262695
We conclude that treatment with exogenous surfactant in postburn victims with ARDS is a promising therapeutic approach to improve the survival rate of these high-risk patients.	1.1704776041782885
The main aesthetic concern of patients with Angle class II deformities with skeletal deep bite - short face syndrome - is the short lower face.	1.218328540565569
It is the orthodontist's task to correct this deformity insofar as possible.	0.8671338056734026
Depending on the extent, even orthodontists at the beginning of their training will recognize this.	1.16273487678576
Since presurgical orthodontic treatment determines the kind and extent of the surgical procedure, the orthodontist has to plan the treatment in for individual case .	1.089466319336157
It is the purpose of this article to demonstrate a concept of treatment for patients with class II deformities, skeletal deep bite, and a short lower face.	1.3274913895958584
Presurgical orthodontic treatment and the surgical procedure to correct the deformity are discussed.	1.2379790151754146
The treatment results show that it is necessary to leave or to create a certain curve of Spee, depending on the extent of the deformity, to achieve a satisfactory result in terms of to function, aesthetics, and stability.	1.1749727555196638
It can be concluded that it is only possible to reach the preset treatment goals with an exact diagnosis and the knowledge of the necessary preparation in combination with the surgical procedure.	1.2321705415456456
Adequate psychotherapeutic treatment of transsexual patients during the "real- life-test" is crucial for the outcome after sex reassignement surgery.	1.1509868306679636
Necessary modifications are discussed along the concept of "transsexual defense" and the interrelation of identity and disordered gender identity.	1.0579923892584575
Usually therapeuts of transsexual patients, who decide over somatic sex reassignement, have to engage also in psychotherapy in a broad sense.	1.138147978322862
Within the setting of the "administrative-psychotherapeutic split" the psychotherapist leaves the decision over admission to sex reassignement to a therapist specialised in gender identity disorders.	0.8885780321652003
In this setting patients have more time to develop insight and have better chances to explore other options and find individual solutions with regard to irreversible sex reassignement surgery.	0.9075310283987352
During recent years in the German federal social welfare system has been subject to several changes due to structural forms.	0.9760218479790369
The hospital sector - as an element of this system - has also been affected.	1.326574213228097
Based on various legislation the financial framework has been reduced which has led to tendencies of economic limitation and rationalization.	0.8440336855367647
From this background considerable risk selection and changes in emphasis might result.	0.7089301279802809
Cost intensive patients with a high need for treatment are referred as quickly as possible and dicharged to outpatient services despite unknown domestic follow-up care.	1.1317043298757186
Mostly the elderly are affected.	0.7296287201956461
Medical rehabilitation can be found in this system at the cut between SGB V and SGB XI.	0.9655702850987186
However, this division raises problems and discussions concerning benefit payment (rehabilitation before nursing, priority of home, etc.).	0.9042408766556249
Right in rehabilitation the most important thing is an overlap of sectors.	0.926546594175687
Various medical, nursing and other social supplies have to be put into a network to achieve an integral treatment of patients that focuses on the individual situation.	1.1020753025567547
In 1995 the Ethics Commission of the Medical University of Lübeck was asked to rule on whether a preimplantation diagnostic procedure (PID) could be performed on a husband and wife who were both carriers of the cystic fibrosis mutation  F508.	1.0203979166063062
The couple had previously given birth to a child with cystic fibrosis and had twice terminated a pregnancy following prenatal screening.	0.9026113994547508
Ethically, the performance of a PID was certainly warranted for this couple.	0.9315761473694015
The risk of violating §§8 Section 1 and/or 2 Section 1 ("totipotent cells shall not be removed for diagnostic purposes") of the Law for the Protection of Embryos (ESchG) was judged to be nonexistent in written statements from two expert witnesses (Prof. K.V.	1.146101417988342
Hinrichsen and Prof. H.M. Beier, both embryologists).	0.9333165223293367
In the view of the Ethics Commission, only §1 Section 2 ("an ovum shall be fertilized only for the purpose of inducing pregnancy") of the ESchG currently prohibits PIDs.	1.3232137659455934
In light of the social and biological arguments in favor of PIDs, however, the Ethics Commission questioned whether this section of the ESchG is still morally justifiable.	1.042939869227221
A 38 year old male patient with a coarctation of the aorta was successfully operated using an ascending aorta-abdominal aorta bypass (AAAAB).	1.0586731934576905
The diagnosis of a severe postisthmic stenosis had been confirmed by aortography.	1.0085346150943804
Preoperatively the patient suffered from extreme hypertension and claudicatio intermittens.	0.6618714442668662
After prosthetic repair of coarctation, blood pressure became normotensive and claudicatio intermittens disappeared.	0.930868499352831
In this report, we discuss various surgical techniques and the most important question concerning the optimal timing of surgical repair of aortic coarctation.	1.2196806893807859
Iatrogenic colonic perforation is a rare but very dangerous complication of colonoscopy.	0.9820703319087922
We report on eleven prospectivly recorded patients treated between 1994 and 1998.	1.134506612553812
In seven cases the colonoscopy had been done for diagnostic and in four cases for therapeutic reason.	1.0099068737510057
Nine women and two men (age range 56 to 92 years) were affected.	1.0723440041025976
In 77 % the perforation was found in the sigmoid colon.	1.1793037229595682
All patients were operated on and five sutures, five resections and one colostomy were performed.	0.9727914049807942
No significant differences could be shown in six patients with classical perforation compared with five patients presenting with prolonged abdominal pain.	1.1186218384354665
Only duration of symptoms was significantly different in the two groups.	0.9069952053040327
Three patients (85, 90 and 92 years) died from late complications.	1.116454009184094
Indications of MR arthrography were analyzed in this prospective study.	0.9464920611539597
The aim was to evaluate possible advantages over conventional MRI, establish diagnostic criteria and to analyze its meaning further for the therapeutic management of postoperative patients.	1.192335841278904
Nerve fibre-neuroendocrine cell complexes (NF-NEC-C's) are neuroendocrine cells located in the lamina propria of the gastrointestinal tract directly connected with nerve fibres of Meissner's plexus.	0.9274004802059477
We report on a patient with sporadic Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) with electron microscopically demonstrated multiple NF-NEC-C's in non-antral gastric mucosa.	0.9084326449893325
It is suspected that in ZES the hypergastrinaemia may represent a trophic stimulus for the proliferation of NF-NEC-C's in the gastric mucosa.	0.8368214247730182
Introduction: The prehospitaly initiated endotracheal intubation and controlled ventilation, is especially in multi-system-trauma cases, recognized to be the "gold standard".	1.067876576367703
Thus especially in view of the increasing demands being placed upon the quality of prehospital emergency treatment in general, the quality of such prehospital induced ventilation, is becoming of increasing importance.	1.086355443822598
Thereby we must take into consideration the limited possabilities, which are afflicted with a high degree of uncertainess, which we have at our disposal to effectively evaluate the efficiency of emergency ventilation.	1.2339038150601216
The purpose of our study within a collective of severely traumatized patients, was to determine the quality of prehospitaly induced ventilation with regards to the adequacy of oxygenation and ventilation and as a result of our findings, to identify areas for procedural optimization.	1.1524229521588172
Staging of any tumor, i.e.	0.46550864593580166
determination of the extent of the disease, serves to select the patients who might profit from curative surgical intervention or to define those patients with inoperable carcinomas who should be referred for other therapies, such as chemotherapy or irradiation.	1.0548292835713258
Furthermore, accurate staging is necessary for assessment of prognosis, for radiation therapy planning, and for differentiation of those with small-cell lung cancer or for follow-up examinations of small-cell lung cancer patients after during and after chemotherapy.	1.3340925909893298
The primary radiological staging and diagnostic modalities for assessment of bronchial carcinomas are computed tomography (CT) of the thorax including liver and adrenal glands, abdominal sonography, and bone scintigraphy.	1.1809157098150458
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be reserved for specific indications, e.g.	0.639559330272632
infiltration of the chest wall or staging of patients with intolerance/allergy to intravenous contrast medium.	1.033634849809303
The clinical value of nuclear medicine techniques, such as [18F]2-fluoride-2-desoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) for evaluation of lymph nodes and distant metastases, In-111 octreotide/somatostatin receptor scans for staging of small-cell lung cancer, and thallium-201 SPECT are currently being assessed in numerous studies, although these techniques are already in routine use.	1.1117439117925465
In future these or nuclear medicine techniques, as well as techniques using molecular-based contrast material, especially for MR imaging, currently in experimental status, may yield serious potential for staging purposes.	0.9877149110069857
Background: We investigated fundus autofluorescence in vivo using a novel scanning laser ophthalmoscope.	1.194090545869888
Myocardial infarctions may be precipitated by external triggers.	0.6514464100273063
External triggers include physical activity and emotional stress as well as other infrequent triggers such as war threats or earthquakes.	0.8938199065899671
Changes in the environment also play an important role in the incidence of myocardial infarctions; circadian, seasonal, and weekly variations have been observed.	0.9671039328546615
Patients' behavior at the onset of symptoms depends on various factors and influences outcome and mortality.	0.984841802005882
Appropriate preventive measures are indicated in order to protect patients during vulnerable periods.	0.9973674384728015
Health education should be directed towards patients' behavior and promptly seeking medical assistance at the onset of symptoms.	0.8569570583999951
Introduction: In patients with neuroendocrine gastrointestinal tumors and liver metastases, but without known extrahepatic manifestations, liver transplantation may be indicated as curativ or "long-term-palliativ" therapy.	1.2141525189908986
For these patients the absence of bone lesions is mandatory.	1.0950581070960261
A patient suffering from long-standing pustular psoriasis of the palms was treated for 3 weeks with a mercury-containing drug.	1.0205546410897217

Mercury levels in blood and urine were increased.	0.8625608063608861
After withdrawal of the mercury preparation, therapy with DMPA (2,3-Dimercapto-1-propane-sulfonic acid), a mercury antidote, was initiated, together with short-term treatment with aromatic retinoids and PUVA.	1.2238597848127497
Within a few days mercury levels decreased significantly and the skin lesions practically disappeared.	1.1287465646175767
Based on the results of chromosome analysis from cell cultures and testis biopsies, the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in infertile men is up to 20%.	0.9796812563336711
Chromosomal analysis from peripheral blood cultures is a routine procedure while the analysis of meiotic chromosomes is labor intensive and mainly used in a scientific setting.	1.0171465717172583
Of all infertile males, 7-9% show numerical and/or structural chromosomal abnormalities in their peripheral blood lymphocytes.	1.056359136271763
There is an inverse correlation between sperm count and the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities, with 21% of patients with non-obstructive azoospermia having a chromosomal abnormality, most often Klinefelter's syndrome.	1.1556340610734244
The rate of patients with chromosomal abnormalities is only 9% in patients with severe oligozoospermia (less than 5 million/ml), and structural abnormalities are found more often in this group.	1.1930003365975799
Using fluorescence in situ analysis the number of selected chromosomes can be assayed in single sperm cells.	0.8643539403552937
There is no consensus on whether infertile men have a higher proportion of aneuploid (disomic) sperm cells than fertile men.	0.9650302854625288
Taking into account the results from meiotic studies in infertile men, an increased rate of aneuploid sperm cells is likely.	1.0716929068381709
Chromosomal analysis should be performed on all infertile men being treated with ICSI as the result of this analysis could have important consequences in their reproductive decisions.	1.0529139897948732
Background: Tufted angioma represents a benign vascular lesion of the skin.	1.1539100959706838

Limb lengthening in dwarfism has become a standardised procedure with a good prognosis.	0.7983632966905182
In most cases external fixation is used.	0.8692634873303164
Gain of leg length up to 15 cm and more is possible in the lower leg and the femur and 8.5 cm in the humerus.	1.3026889386181055
Limb lengthening is useful in many cases of dwarfism due to skeletal dysplasia.	0.9303879342928768
There are a number of risks and possible complications involved and the procedure also requires considerable time.	0.9633429230337087
We report the results of 48 patients with dwarfism operated on in the Orthopädische Kinderklinik Aschau (Orthopaedic Hospital for Children).	1.0335263641115495
Process-Experiential (PE) therapy is a neo-humanistic treatment that strives to maintain a creative tension between a client-centered emphasis on a genuine, prizing, empathic relationship and the active, task-focused process-directive style of Gestalt therapy.	0.5338090966963029
A research-informed treatment (Grawe 1997), its theory of function and dysfunction has been updated via contributions from contemporary psychological theory.	0.7674601594026085
It incorporates a set of key therapeutic tasks, each of which is characterized by a specific client marker and resolution state, series of steps clients pass through on their way to resolution, and therapist interventions used to facilitate client progress through those steps.	0.5587336475520397
The first part of this review provides an overview of Process-Experiential therapy, including theoretical foundation, that is, emotion theory, dialectical constructivism, and task analytic process orientation, and the basic treatment principles.	1.247912083466698
Malnutrition is a common finding amongst our elders.	1.0327734612667214
The causes of malnutrition are multifactorial and although they have been extensively studied, they are not entirely understood.	1.0822095210331122
Both physiological and pathological processes of aging put this population at a higher risk of being undernourished.	0.9026083909935326
These may be related to social, financial, psychological and/or physiological changes directly or indirectly associated to growing old.	0.9640969942924538
We report on a 76-year-old female patient with clinical findings consistent with necrolytic migratory erythema.	1.1427068979060406

Objective: Hypoplastic left heart (HLH) is a complex developmental malformation of the left ventricle, aorta, and associated valves.	1.3008602780060057
Survival beyond neonatal period is the exception in untreated infants.	0.8164829287278821
The prognosis, however, is no longer hopeless.	1.0569556373322324
Clinical stabilization of a neonate with HLH is appropriate until a management decision, based on appropriate parental counselling, can be made.	0.9414783325233197
Forty-one patients demonstrating clinical symptoms for cerebral infarction were investigated by magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion-weighted echo-planar imaging (DWI) and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI).	1.1184107022987617
In 8 patients only DWI showed the cerebral lesions clearly.	0.8789920145341877
One patient with positive DWI and T2WI suffered from HSV encephalitis.	0.8622325412770335
DWI is superior to T2WI in assessment of small cortical infarcts and cerebral infarction in patients with preexisting vascular lesions.	0.8811360988954038
DWI is not specific, so other causes like cerebral hematoma and encephalitis have to be considered.	0.9813134692254132
Juvenile polyposis was first described by Cronkhite and Canada in 1955.	0.805557044979242
This disease is characterized by juvenile intestinal polyps and ectodermal abnormalities.	0.7516023388312484
The etiology of Cronkhite-Canada syndrome (CCS), however, is still not well understood.	1.2843901503157782
Interestingly, among patients with CCS a significant correlation (16.5 %) with intestinal carcinomas has been observed.	1.1429237950392706
Thus, malignant transformation and/or genetic predisposition may be involved in the initiation of the disease.	1.0534884893059406
In the following, epidemiology, symptoms, morphology and therapy of CCS are discussed.	1.0443112729049886
Our examinations are based on studies reported in the literature and on a case report of a female patient who developed a colon carcinoma 2 years after initial diagnosis of CCS.	1.285245397207275
Pacemaker erythema is a rare, irreversible side effect of cardiac pacemakers, clinically characterized by epifocal teleangiectatic erythema.	0.9414134553553836
Histology reveals teleangiectatic vessels in the superficial dermis and a slight perivascular infiltrate.	0.8210543344680277
We report on three patients presenting with pacemaker erythema following either pacemaker or defibrillator implantation.	1.0580567544252322
The pathogenesis of this histopathologically uncharacteristic lesion is unknown.	0.8822040940334916
In contrast to peri- or postoperative pacemaker infections, physical irritation can be considered a possible triggering mechanism.	1.2788912205065062
Allergic reactions to the implanted material have been ruled out by negative patch test results.	0.8427416608419556
The present legal requirements for the prescription of controlled drugs remains an impediment to adequate therapy for chronic pain because of an abundance of legal regulations.	0.9621289088175442
The physician prescribing opioids must consider the permitted maximum amount per prescription, the period of time the drug is prescribed for, numerous cross references, and other special regulations, and he still cannot be sure that he does not violate certain legal requirements.	1.0592641122334918
Often these difficulties result in withholding necessary pain treatment!	0.6525665450704297
In the authors' opinion it should be sufficient to write a specific prescription form for controlled drugs in the same way as any other ordinary prescription without jeopardizing the safety of the drug control system.	1.045334265265656
It is important that the use of the narcotic be justified in the sense of § 13 Abs.	0.9481981467408014
1 of the drug control regulation, as judged by the responsible prescriber of the drug, and that any offence be punished.	1.325306547801533
The use of triplicate prescriptions guarantees sufficient proof.	0.6475976700906526
Legislation is requested that will substitute for the present drug control regulations, which are difficult to handle.	1.1463972275234584
The aim of the study was to investigate the ability to activate the quadriceps femoris muscle voluntarily in patients after severe knee injuries and it's influence on muscle function.	0.9996630362196113
33 male patients after ACL-rupture with concomitant injuries were investigated with a twitch-interpolation-method to determine the maximal voluntary contraction force (MVC) and the ability to activate the quadriceps muscle voluntarily.	1.0863498384817634
The results were compared to a previously investigated group of patients after isolated ACL-rupture and to an aged-matched control group.	1.1597760510964048
Managed care, i.e., the integration of health insurance and delivery of care under the direction of one organization, is gaining importance in the USA health market.	1.072522401248871
The initial effects consisted of a decrease in insurance premiums, a very attractive feature for employers.	0.960793532480269
Managed care promises to contain expenditures for health care.	0.5547862696502655
Given the shrinking public resources in Germany, managed care seems attractive for the German health system, too.	0.7412773996790419
In this review the development of managed care, the principal elements, forms of organisation and practical tools are outlined.	1.085728817720239
The regulation of the delivery of care by means of controlling and financial incentives threatens the autonomy of physicians: the physician must act as a "double agent", caring for the interest for the individual patient and being restricted by the contract with the managed care organisation.	1.103129547589163
Cost containment by managed care was achieved by reducing the fees for physicians and hospitals (and partly by restricting care for patients).	0.9377898805259828
Only a fraction of this cost reduction was handed over to the enrollee or employer, and most of the money was returned with profit to the shareholders of the managed care organisations.	0.9404477732385244
The preeminent role of primary care physicians as gatekeepers of the health network led to a reduced demand for specialist services in general and for university hospitals and anesthesiologists in particular.	1.028900461668244
The paradigm of managed care, i.e., to guide the patient and the care giver through the health care system in order to achieve cost-effective and high quality care, seems very attractive.	1.2081597445284689
The stress on cost minimization by any means in the daily practice of managed care makes it doubtful if managed care should be an option for the German health system, in particular because there are a number of restrictions on it in German law.	1.0427630844641922
Background: Analysis of the impact of head fractures, intracranial hemorrhages, brain edema, and prognostic risk factors on long-term outcome in children with severe head injury.	1.1984290431775944
Background: In the past, the main problem of transscleral cyclophotocoagulation was related to the energy dosage of the individual effect.	1.3595725436802684
Since the target tissue is not directly observable, no information about the coagulation process was available to the surgeon.	1.0529019014654695
High inter- and intraindividual variations of the tissue properties often led to under- or overdosage.	1.1475128817840246
Underdosage is therapeutically useless, while overdosage causes the so-called "popeffects" which may induce severe damage to the eye.	1.0415561297181617
In the past, most scientific or routine studies on heart rate variability (HRV) were done using commercial Holter ECG devices with traditional magnetic tapes.	1.0214441349841443
All methods to calculate parameters of HRV are based on the measurement of time intervals between successive sinus cardiac beats, in practice RR intervals.	1.0614194656638594
Hence, results of HRV calculation depend on the quality of primary data acquisition.	1.0210062461355514
However, technical standards on accuracy of RR interval acquisition in magnetic tape and digital solid state Holter ECG systems do not exist as yet.	1.0936588968609224
Therefore in a laboratory investigation accuracy of HRV parameter calculation after traditional standard tape with and without real-time analysis and digital solid state data acquisition was compared in three commercial Holter ECG systems [Ela medical (E), Oxford Medilog Excel (O) and Medset Cardiolight (M)].	1.03511062751005
A computer-based ECG simulator was used to synthesize a test signal consisting of artificial P-QRS complexes of fixed rate, quartz stabilized "sinus rhythms".	0.8659346946343613
Two channel analog tape and digital 24h recordings of the fixed rate test signal were performed simultaneously.	0.804197808133339
The influence of recording technology on accuracy of RR interval measurement and consequently on time domaine HRV was shown by comparing five standard 24-h time domain parameters.	0.8939423130990103
As expected, in the three Holter systems the analog tape recordings showed a higher, technically induced, artificial RR variability.	1.0648004925336365
The SDNN values (E: 9.38ms vs 2.68ms; p<0.001; O: 3.89ms vs 0.97ms; p<0.001; M: 10.47ms vs 2.89ms; p=0.001), SDNN-Index values (E: 8.22ms vs 0.90ms; p<0.001; O: 3.75ms vs 0.90ms; p<0.001; M: 7.81ms vs 1.49ms, p<0.001) and RMSSD-values (E: 10.39ms vs 2.16ms; p<0.001; O: 10.05ms vs 1.88ms, p<0.001; M: 8.62ms vs 1.69ms; p<0.001) were significantly lower if acquisition was done by digital solid devices in all systems, SDANN (M: 9.83ms vs 5.37ms; p<0.001) in the Medset system too.	0.9936182436269705
The used method is a possible way to validate commercial Holter ECG systems for HRV analysis.	0.9369175566759975
Clinical significance of artifical HRV seems to be low.	0.8335300373292786
Cases of gallstone ileus (108) were analyzed retrospectively over 30 years.	1.1344202108547667
Even today, when laparoscopic cholecystectomy is done, the incidence of this rare disease remains the same.	1.1756325175942424
History, clinical and X-ray findings are non-specific.	0.8699938771403887
Aerobilia was seen in 17 % of the patients.	0.8385475765253908
Since 1992 sonography has proveded an exact diagnosis in 10 of 15 cases.	0.9388738926350401
In the triad of known gallstone, non-specific epigastric pain with assumed small intestinal obstruction, and impossible detection of a stone in the gallbladder, there is strong suspicion of a gallstone ileus.	1.0849556949064987
The evidence is given if the gallstone is seen in the bowels.	0.8830013856039813
Intraoperatively more than one stone was found in the intestines in 20 %, and cholecystoduodenal fistulas were encountered in 83 %.	1.1449501338081856
There has been no significant change in mortality for 30 years.	0.9754964492122062
Autologous transplantation in brachial plexus injuries has become significantly more efficacious through increased knowledge of the microtopographic anatomy of the fascicle structures and the refinement of microneurosurgical techniques.	0.8612069060758358
Recovery of shoulder and upper arm functions can be achieved with autologous transplantation in the majority of patients under optimized conditions.	1.1277396870689473
However, attempts to restore forearm, hand and finger functions in this way have been disappointing so far.	1.2552698047276618
Therapeutic success is primarily governed by early decision making, selection of adequate surgical strategies and intensive and longlasting postoperative management.	0.9188600051247381
Leg venectasia is a common problem.	0.6953350781819126
Although there are a variety of therapeutic modalities, none of them gives satisfactory results.	0.9602113531898331
The effects of sclerotherapy in the treatment of telangiectasia with a small diameter are poor.	0.9072637247120704
Electrocoagulation and argon laser treatment often result in scarring.	0.6873708019812945
We studied the effectiveness of the flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser at a wavelength of 585 nm in the treatment of leg venectasia.	0.9226472433631484
After repeated treatments using this laser system, only 30% of the vessels that looked blue on clinical examination could be removed; we obtained better lightening of smaller red, telangiectatic vessels with a diameter up to 0.4 mm.	1.2067508719603945
However, hyperpigmentation frequently developed after treatment.	1.2123031477184762
In post-treatment biopsies, occlusion of the vessels was found.	0.9639177695714051
Based on these results, we recommend a combined therapy for leg venectasia.	1.2139898001897562
Larger diameter vessels should be treated with sclerotherapy, while finer telangiectasia can be treated with the flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser.	1.0177785507328794
Total hip replacement is often recommended for the treatment of femoral neck fractures in elderly patients.	0.8249050903364266
A less invasive approach with shorter operating time is the replacement of the femoral head only, leaving the acetabular cartilage in situ.	0.9889913723271964
Hemiarthroplastic hip replacement using a metallic head prosthesis was not successful in the past, because the majority of patients developed protrusio acetabuli after surgery.	1.1568712943398944
In the present study hemiarthroplastic hip replacement using an Al2O3-ceramic head was shown to be a useful method for the treatment of femoral neck fractures in elderly patients.	0.959115853295493
From 1985 to 1990 277 patients were treated with hemiarthroplasty.	0.8846358535955477
The average age at the time of accident and operation was 81.7 years.	1.094927628207847
At the time of follow-up in 1993 only 77 survivors were available for examination.	0.995112446296771
A standardized score was calculated assessing activity, gait, hip pain, etc., with the patients obtaining an average score of 58 out of a possible 78 points.	1.1868428092521972
Only three patients had hip pain, and in four cases the roentgenographic examination revealed protrusio acetabuli.	1.2270275145585696
Two of these four patients underwent revision surgery for replacement of the cup, leaving the stem in situ.	0.8531530505084254
In view of the small number of approach-related complications, hemiarthroplastic hip replacement using an Al2O3-ceramic head is the recommended surgical treatment for femoral neck fractures in elderly patients.	0.8858121001636464
In the rare patient with protrusio acetabuli, revision surgery can be performed to replace the cup, leaving the stem in situ.	0.8518972844901385
Functional relaxation (FE), a somato-psychotherapeutic method, can reduce asthmatic symptoms.	1.085154263622194
The efficiency of a 5 minute introduction of elements of functional relaxation (EFE) is compared with a placebo-relaxation-method not based on the hypothetical mechanisms of FE, and a standardised pharmacological bronchodilative test using salbutamol.	1.200100056904019
In a controlled prospective randomised single blind setting 18 children and adolescents with acute asthma were treated on three consecutive days with each method.	0.944151196284615
Before and ten minutes after therapy the patients had bodyplethysmographic pulmonary function testing.	1.0308802126496783
U-Tests showed that the baseline measurements were comparable.	0.8545483649490998
The before-after-comparison revealed significant changes for EFE and salbutamol, not for the placebo-relaxation.	0.9274587199209917
There were significant differences between the intraindividual differences of the airway resistance and the specific airway resistance between salbutamol and the placebo-relaxation, not between EFE and salbutamol or EFE and the placebo-relaxation.	0.9861589201746194
FE can be an effective complementary treatment in children or adolescents with asthma.	1.0436348965161673

Assessment of life satisfaction was done by means of a proven valid and reliable test instrument (FLZ - "Fragen zur Lebenszufriedenheit").	1.1581988379252777
Further specific questions on treatment satisfaction, aesthetic result, occupation and income were added to this questionnaire.	0.8378541040909139
Significant discrepancies of the items recreational activities, income, occupation and partnership, productivity, mobility and pain were evaluated in comparison to available data of healthy west german population.	0.9852814178773956
The calculated global index of life satisfaction and health differed significantly from the established index of west german population.	0.8809162251406406
Although specific aspects like aesthetic result, donor site morbidity, pain and even function were critically judged, 91 % of the patients were satisfied with the long term result of the treatment.	1.2098464008143905

No removal of bony wedge thus avoiding leg shortening.	0.7268019050465001
The aim of this study was to analyze the localization and distribution of extracellular matrix in normal and glaucomatous damaged optic discs using immunohistochemical methods.	0.870104509998476
Five eyes donated for corneal allografting without any history of glaucoma and three other eyes with secondary glaucoma were studied.	0.8169267963643042
Immunohistochemical reactions were performed with antibodies against collagen types I, III, IV and VI and against laminin, proliferating antigen KI 67 and GFAP.	0.9688394941595676
In glaucomatous eyes the characteristic arrangement of collagen fibrils is lacking.	0.7664605493387692
Septa of the lamina cribrosa appear enlarged.	0.7847095620282676
The immunoreactivity of all examined collagen types is stronger in glaucomatous eyes.	0.8118440431092236
The axon basement membranes show an irregular and interrupted pattern.	0.6610781408596836
The number of proliferating cells with positive GFAP staining in glaucomatous cribriform plates is distinctly higher.	0.8213400961670219
We postulate that fibroblasts and astrocytes in the stroma of glaucomatous lamina cribrosa could be stimulated to increased and uncontrolled proliferation.	0.8914753735666288
Associated disorganization and raised secretion of extracellular matrix may lead to axon constriction and, secondarily, to neural degeneration.	0.8749976697332074
Concomitant pathologies (labral lesions, intra-/extra-osseous ganglia and stress bone marrow edema) in adult residual hip dysplasia (RHD) might influence the outcome of conservative hip surgery.	1.0500309121162286
The aim of our prospective clinical study was to assess the value of preoperative MR arthrography in diagnosing concomitant lesions and in making surgical decisions in RHD.	1.1411693776103804
The first 37 consecutive patients with a minimum follow-up of 18 months have been analysed.	1.24972380632094
All 37 patients presented RHD with the clinical symptomatology of labral lesions and underwent routine preoperative MRA.	0.9464549950104357
According to clinical, radiological and MR arthrographical criteria, these 37 patients were subdivided into four therapeutic subgroups: (1) reorientation of the acetabulum using the Tönnis triple pelvic osteotomy (TPO); (2) intertrochanteric varisation osteotomy (IVO); (3) palliative decompression with only symptomatic partial resection of the torn labrum (PALL); (4) primary total hip replacement (TEP).	1.0177930673103908
Based on the preliminary clinical and radiological outcomes of these four subgroups, the following conclusions can be drawn: labral lesions are considered to be a sign of chronic joint instability.	1.0896577830308023
Therefore, acetabular malorientation should be corrected by redirectional osteotomy of the acetabulum (TPO-subgroup) even in low grades of RHD if labral lesions are present.	1.0722915386318397
"Palliative" labral resections without corrective osteotomy (PALL subgroup) in secondary osteoarthritis due to RHD are definitively obsolete, because they rapidly progress to severe osteoarthritis due to surgically accelerated joint instability.	0.9907903108637213
In RHD with highly osteoarthritic hip joints and concomitant lesions, one should not hesitate to perform primary THR even in young patients.	0.9807452243462943
Severe infections of the talus are often associated with complete septic collapse of the talus.	0.8814860577057458
In this connection, open fractures with defects or significant comminution have a bad prognosis is as far as reconstruction of the talus is concerned.	1.0835041599633966
In the Department of Traumatology, Braunschweig, in 1995 three patients (all male, average age 35.3 +/- 10.2 years) were treated with cancellous bone grafting after talectomy performed because of infection and complete septic collapse of the talus.	1.0520268698551876
In two of these cases third-degree open total dislocation of the talus had been sustained.	1.2497179185694502
The third patient came to us after undergoing arthroscopy of the ankle region in another hospital.	1.0120942095489263
In each case a fulminating infection was the outcome.	0.8313388378893558
Following a step-by-step algorithm, in a first step urgent radical debridement with talectomy was done.	1.0747113331487703
To maintain approximation between the tibia and calcaneus on one side and the os naviculare on the other, the bony defect was filled with PMMA chains and the external fixateur technique was used for immobilization during treatment of the infection.	1.1419239308477815
After second- and third-look procedures a free flap was grown for soft tissue coverage within the first 10 days.	1.0317721847161312
After 17.6 +/- 3.3 days the talus was replaced with a cancellous bone graft, combined with double arthrodesis in two cases, and external fixation for the next 4-5 weeks.	1.1301403406651498
In the third patient a triple arthrodesis was done.	0.9062411516912349
At follow-up after an average of 12 months (range 8-17 months), the bone graft with arthrodesis had been completely integrated in all cases.	1.251465500876313
All patients are free of symptoms in normal life.	1.0006943751954354
In the case of severe open fractures of the talus with significant comminution combined with infection and septic bone collapse conservation of the talus is often impossible.	1.1569942477215702
The combination of homologous cancellous bone grafting and arthrodesis after talectomy is therefore a good method of keeping any decrease in the function of the foot to a minimum.	1.0366203939105878
Meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis was diagnosed in a 63 year old female in Austria.	1.0205115904495359
Sixteen months after onset she still suffers from ataxia, disturbance of gait and bilateral hearing impairment.	0.8417741358795406
Being a farmer, the patient belongs to a recognized high-risk-group, as most other infected people do.	1.3080678734989768
To the best of our knowledge, there has been no report of a human infection by Streptococcus suis in Austria so far.	0.9477643531863761
The results of neurophysiological tests excluded a direct lesion to the cochlea during the acute phase of meningitis, and thus, are in contrast to the guinea-pig-model by Kay, who showed suppurative labyrinthitis being the cause of hearing loss.	1.2882310733081315
The present knowledge of Streptococcus suis meningitis with respect to neurophysiology, pathogenesis, epidemiology and increasing resistance against antibiotics is discussed.	0.8366102611623826
The introduction of atypical antipsychotics has presented new options for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenic patients.	0.8834015990315057
It is assumed that in the near future, neuroleptic medication will shift from conventional to atypical antipsychotics for an increasing number of patients.	1.0187447742394595
The present article addresses guidelines for the conversion from conventional to atypical neuroleptics in inpatient and outpatient settings.	0.9330667374542784
Numerous epidemiological studies about multiple trauma patients do not include an analysis of patients under the age of 18.	1.137670487837053
To study this, the data of 682 patients with multiple traumata, treated between 1981 and 1991 at Hannover Medical School, Germany, were retrospectively analyzed.	1.1696127870084596
The patients were divided into four age-related groups: preschool age (< 6 years), school age (< 13 years), teenagers (< 18 years) and adults (L 18 years).	1.351930598515252
Analyzed were the cause of trauma, localization of injuries and the cause of death.	1.0630847393345457
Children were less often injured as passengers in cars, but more often injured as pedestrians and bicyclists than adults.	0.9431951935930146
However, children showed a significant higher mortality than adults, with threefold increased risk of death when they injured as passengers in car accidents.	1.3629020103383256
In all groups injuries to the head and the legs were most common.	1.1844425827900058
Children showed a lower incidence of trauma to the thorax, abdomen, hip and arms than the adult group.	0.9690352106118263
Nevertheless, trauma to the thorax, abdomen and head was associated with the highest risk of death in all groups.	1.2113634038191972
Spinal cord injuries, especially injuries to the neck, also showed a high risk of death.	1.299755278388881
Children younger than 6 years had the most severe head injuries.	1.0989588440202647
Safety improvements for children in cars, helmet usage on bicycles and early training in traffic safety for children might decrease the lethality in this group of trauma patients.	0.9489809972783019
During the past 7 years 45 patients have been operated upon using the Childs-Phillips method.	0.9875024857187279
Of those, 37 were subsequently examined for the study - 7 patients had died in the meantime.	1.310823168528739
None of the deaths occurred as a direct result of transmesenteric small-bowel plication.	1.0688524988529313
An early recurrence of intestinal obstruction occurred in 4.4 % and a laparotomy was repeated.	1.3142847896808962
During the most recent examinations 86.5 % of those patients checked had (virtually) no complaints - 91.9 % based upon the Visick classification.	1.2662132236742394
A subtotal intestinal obstruction occurred during the period of the study in 8.1 % of cases, but could be conservatively treated.	1.218900927114857
Up until the most recent examination there were still no instances of a late recurrence.	1.0383500164551276
Most intestinal obstruction recurrences are due to errors specific to the technique and are early recurrences.	0.9124949473930822
On the basis of our results, we are of the opinion that plication in the presence of existing peritonitis, as well as partial plication, is acceptable.	1.130651636562349
To prospectively survey skin lesions in a large group of newborns, as no such study has as yet been performed in Germany.	1.0784508905912724
We present the case of a 35-year-old patient suffering from schizoaffective psychosis.	0.8733577964985498
After 4 weeks on clozapine he developed acute priapism.	0.7242544701856224
Possible explanations and pathophysiology are discussed as well as the requirement for sufficient information of the patient.	1.1865272300881116
Delay of urgent urologic treatment incrases the risk of irreversible impotence.	0.7343739650393233
The patient's history should be evaluated with respect to former unphysiological prolonged erections.	1.0764957032457183
The further development of 162 stroke patients (average age 77 years), who were geriatrically assessed during hospitalization, was evaluated ca.	1.2875318798522832
Questionnaires were mailed to patients.	0.42552861530632136
53% of the patients (n = 86) returned the questionnaire duly filled in; 20% (n = 32) had died; in the remaining 27% of cases (n = 44) no information was obtained on further development.	1.3548635910133904
80% of those patients who responded lived at home despite numerous medical problems.	1.1372188844912738
Family members assumed most of the care required.	0.8033062859661662
Follow-up treatment and pain therapy proved to be particularly problematic.	1.1749367043961476
The Barthel Index according to data collected was significantly lower compared to figures noted upon release from the hospital.	0.8440426135487222
Hardly anyone among those patients received follow-up treatment.	1.0394998756724791
74% of patients complained of pain although the majority has regular contacts with the family doctor.	1.1556460133600421
For those patients who died in the 18 months interval, significantly lower values for the activities of daily living (ADL) has already been recorded upon hospitalization.	1.1393753138526659
They had a less favorable view of their state of health and were less satisfied with life in general.	1.0594250186204652
The routine staging work-up for renal cancer includes a contrast-enhanced multiphasic spiral CT and a chest radiograph.	1.0448326666950587
If there is doubt regarding the presence and extent of (supradiaphragmatic) IVC thrombus, MR imaging should be performed.	1.0160123713904374
Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging should be used in place of CT in any patient with severe renal dysfunction, symptomatic polycystic kidney disease, or a history of allergy to iodinated contrast media.	1.1502863603869506
Cavography is no longer needed in the era of (adaptive array detector) spiral CT and MR venography.	1.1024881613388935
Patients: We report on four infants with nonketotic hyperglycinemia, three with a neonatal form and one with the milder infantile form.	1.2021922948212957
Despite early diagnosis and persistent therapy including dextromethorphan and sodium benzoate, two infants with the neonatal form deteriorated progressively and died at the age of 16 and 50 months, respectively, only one survived severely retarded with seizures, opisthotonus and spastic quadriplegia.	1.0306768804935509
The serum concentrations of glycine decreased following sodium benzoate treatment but cerebrospinal fluid/serum glycine ratio remained elevated with no improvement in clinical outcome.	0.8317085916965914
The patient with the infantile form has been treated for over three years with dextromethorphan, and is now a severely retarded child without seizure activity and continuous psychomotor development.	1.173470322524268
Immunosuppression-related Candida infections may be most successfully treated using biological response modifiers and recombinant cytokines to enhance expression of host pro-inflammatory and antimicrobial mediators, notably tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-), interleukin 1 (IL-1), and gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN).	1.0322825908525721
Important but unappreciated differences in the immunopathophysiology of fungal vs. bacterial infections make such cytokine priming appear contrary to current strategies for reducing cytokine-mediated organ injury and mortality due to gram-negative bacteremia and endotoxemia.	0.8725321351350296
Optimistically, preclinical studies to date have found that the coadministration of such immunoadjuvants does not compromise, and actually may improve, the efficacy of synthetic antifungals.	1.052408308047259
Such combination therapies should continue to be evaluated in animal models of Candida infection which otherwise progress to lethal shock or chronic disseminated disease despite aggressive use of existing antifungal agents.	0.8984384302279973
Bilateral neck exploration is the standard procedure in primary hyperparathyroidism.	0.9842546621244321
Using a bilateral approach, preoperative localization studies are not mandatory.	0.9607659401218756
A localized single gland disease is the basis for a minimally invasive procedure.	1.072702063585671
Therefore preoperative localization techniques play an important role in planning (minimally invasive) first time exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism.	0.9464822217852314
The combination of 99 mTc-SestaMIBI scintigraphy with ultrasound allows correct localization of the parathyroid adenoma in 86 % of all single gland diseases.	1.0864029485735427
Multiple gland disease could be predicted in isolated cases only.	0.6893893625363124
Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging could not improve the results.	0.7359379385063721
Surgery for persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism should only be performed after positive localization studies.	0.9557956891809013
Prehospital thrombolysis is often recommended for patients in whom a major time gain of >90 min compared to in-hospital therapy is expected.	1.0929595513515435
It has been repeatedly shown by metropolitan rescue services that very early presentation after onset of symptoms in a high percentage of patients offers an additional chance for optimizing thrombolytic therapy.	1.0091874000451027
More than half of all patients presenting with an acute myocardial infarction to the EMS may be treated within 90 min after symptom onset, enabling preservation of major myocardial areas at risk.	1.142639582310526
Thus, prehospital thrombolysis in metropolitan areas offers a chance to take advantage of an ideal time window, without additional risk.	1.1172941767414262
Moreover, technical and diagnostic preconditions are easily fulfilled.	1.1846344220563985
Low resection and intersphincteric extirpation of rectal cancer in the distal third of the rectum has become an accepted sphincter-saving method.	1.1094794798938834
From December 1990 to December 1994, 42 patients (17 women and 25 men) with a mean age of 67.2 years had a low resection or extirpation of the rectum at our institution.	1.1976529430299907
Eighteen patients received a transanal sutured anastomosis, 24 a stapler anastomosis.	0.8953695703487652

"NoToX Histological Fixative" is a formaldehyde substitute for the fixation of tissues prior to histological investigation.	0.9744236479890303
Intraoperative samples and necropsy tissue were tested.	0.653777504686652
NoToX was substituted for formaldehyde in the fixation step, otherwise the same manufacturer-specified protocols were used for all reagents.	0.9356993553879968
Conventional histological and accepted immunohistological investigations, especially for tumour diagnosis, were used.	1.2347543896333946
In all tests, results with NoToX-fixated tissue were similar to those with tissue fixed with formaldehyde regarding both staining and diagnosis.	1.0211783710871356
NoToX is a useful substitute for formaldehyde.	0.9200306712596298
The aim of this article is to provide current information on morphological parameters useful for a forensic age estimation of human skin wounds.	1.0528559412401932
In addition to mainly cellular reactions detectable by routine histological or enzyme histochemical techniques, immunohistochemical parameters and their forensic value are especially discussed.	0.9019477489476859
A dynamic helical CT scan following initial ultrasound provides reliable radiological staging for kidney traumas and immediate diagnosis of most abdominal injuries.	0.8539950675072513

With worldwide over 1million applications, vascular closure devices have been established as an essential tool of invasive cardiology.	1.0848980347287493
This overview compares today's four commercially available closure devices, VasoSeal (VS), Angio-SealTM (AS), Perclose, Inc. (PC) and DuettTM (DU) for their usefulness after coronary interventions.	1.2022838309168764
The published data regarding deployment success rates for VS, AS, PC and DU are in the range of 88%, 91%, 90% and 98% up to 100%, respectively.	1.2842002814236266
Times to hemostasis were 5-13', 2-4', 11-19' and 4-14', accompanied by times to mobilization of 6-9h, 6-8h, 4-7h and 2-6h.	1.2121146256288575
Minor complications were described in 8%, 5.9%, 5.3% and 2.1%, major complications in 5.3%, 1.3%, 4% and 2.6%.	1.6278896842293
Although none of the closure devices has been shown to reduce major local complications as compared to manual compression, all sealing devices have documented a significant reduction in time to hemostasis.	1.1571451283680072
The increased patient comfort is essentially related to the ability of sheath removal immediately after PTCA.	0.9384882299119024
Vascular closure devices reduce the burden of medical staff and decrease hospital costs by earlier discharge.	0.8787712429960285
Amniotic fluid is a major factor of the intrauterine environment, and deviation from the normal volume is associated with an increased perinatal morbidity and mortality.	1.079930140990016
Polyhydramnios occurs in 0.2 to 1.6 % of pregnancies.	1.139545330320001
It may be due to a number of congenital anomalies, an abnormal karyotype, maternal diabetes, Rh-disease or intrauterine infections potentially requiring non-invasive or invasive measures.	0.9798568151095384
However, the most common indication for prenatal intervention due to polyhydramnios is the Twin-Twin-Transfusion Syndrom (TTTS).	1.1021821402005072
Treatment of polyhydramnios may focus on correction of the causative lesion, or symptomatic relief through drainage of amniotic fluid.	0.9930200989086587
Maternal administration of cyclooxygenase inhibitors represents a further, non-invasive therapeutic option.	0.8747270400375136
Indomethacin, Sulindac, or Nimesulide reduce the fetal urine output thus decreasing amniotic fluid volume over time without the risks associated with invasive procedures.	0.9477762602455286
However, potentially serious ductal constriction as well as a delay in the onset of amniotic fluid reduction have limited its application.	1.2662774902725207
Percutaneous amniotic fluid drainage may provide immediate reduction of intrauterine pressure, but is associated with a complication rate of 1 to 1.5 %.	1.2011457268238803
The hemodynamic characteristics of monochorionic pregnancies complicated by TTTS have led to the development of endoscopic laser coagulation of placental vascular anastomoses as a definitive treatment.	0.8037774437633904
Treatment is only required in a small minoritiy of pregnancies with polyhydramnios.	1.0112688058482255
Mild cases can be managed expectatively.	0.8272698243518454
Intrauterine pressure increases with an excessive increase in amniotic fluid volume (AFI > 400 mm or MVP > 150 mm) leads to the elevation of intrauterine pressure.	0.9793561853705829
Complications such as preterm premature rupture of membranes and preterm labor may lead to premature delivery.	0.7256559583914752
The main goal of prenatal treatment of polyhydramnios is thus the improvement of fetal outcome through prolongation of gestation and/or the alleviation of maternal symptoms.	1.0154351317589456
With the recent developments in computer technology and the improvements in modern neuroimaging, frame-based stereotactic guidance for open microsurgical procedures has been increasingly replaced by neuronavigation, also called frameless stereotaxy.	0.9737516389379561
It allows transfer of individual patient's images onto the operative field to assist the neurosurgeon intraoperatively in defining the tumor margins or identifying functionally important brain areas.	0.9207109186682384
The different localization techniques employed are articulated position-sensing arms, infrared or ultrasound systems working with the principle of satellite navigation and robotic systems integrated with the operating microscope.	0.9238387493638605
In 200 operations performed with different systems (arm-based, robotic and infrared) the method proved to be helpful, enabling fewer invasive procedures to be performed.	1.1458242014693658
With a mean deviation of 2.87 +/- 1.9 mm for intraoperative localization, the accuracy was only slightly worse than in frame-based stereotaxy with deviations below 2 mm.	1.2033806242611622
Neuronavigation was most helpful for operations on deeply seated lesions, skull-base tumors and lesions in brain areas with high functionality.	0.9278545890098711
The major disadvantage is the use of preoperative data for navigation, leading to inaccuracies when anatomical structures are altered during the operation by resection of tumors or shift of intracranial soft tissue.	1.0702710729970262
Intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might be a solution for this problem.	0.8370564959010401
With the method of intraoperative MRI developed in our department it has already been possible to update neuronavigation with images reflecting intraoperative changes in anatomy.	0.9821925405313631
Therefore, neuronavigation is definitely a method with growing importance in operative routine, and it will also spread into other surgical specialties.	1.213134760572453
Severe pain of mucositis induced by cytostatic conditioning therapy in bone marrow transplantation (BMT) patients generally requires continuous parenteral opioid treatment.	1.0123352453020618
Cognitive and psychological disturbances are frequent complications subsequent to BMT and may result from cerebral opioid side effects.	0.9640462784779773
The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficiency of continuous morphine in mucositis pain and the side-effects in BMT patients.	0.9230011592044833
Particular emphasis was placed on the question of whether reaction times, which are usually measured to estimate opioid effects upon vigilance, are influenced by pain-induced cognitive impairments in pain patients.	1.1890481551522267
Methods While in hospital, 10 BMT patients were examined daily with the aid of a mucositis scale, subjective visual analog scales (VAS) for pain and mood parameters, a German version of the McGill pain questionnaire (MPQ), and a mental performance task battery, and the morphine given was documented.	1.2392012987763967
Mental performance tests were simple auditory reaction time and choice reaction time.	0.7785433585113791
Seven patients also performed a Sternberg memory search test in which they had to use 'yes' and 'no' response keys to match visually presented test letters to a previously memorized set of letters.	0.9358273539759622
Practice and baseline data were collected within the first week before BMT.	1.0374049851711746
Results The intensity and duration of mucositis differed from patient to patient, resulting in different pain intensities and MPQ scores.	0.9335468028741106
Prolongation of the choice reaction time averaged over the period of mucositis treatment correlated significantly with residual pain intensity (Spearman rs = 0.88, p < 0.01) but not with morphine dose (rs = 0.35, p = 0.33).	0.9782822439671499
For the Sternberg memory search test greater correlation coefficients resulted between reaction time and morphine dose (rs = 0.86, p = 0.014) than between reaction time and residual pain intensity (rs = 0.61, p = 0.15).	0.8709139856976517
In turn, pain intensity, unlike morphine dose, was significantly correlated with high scores in the mood parameters for depression, passivity, and tiredness.	1.1385718069217283
Conclusions It is concluded that both pain and morphine can impair cognitive performance, but that these mental stressors seem to differ according to qualitative criteria.	1.0031119795986734
Whereas pain might slow reaction time by distracting a patient's attention, particularly in low mental demand tasks, morphine could interfere with more specific cognitive processes, such as short-term memory operations, that are required in more complex tasks.	1.1623515806385782
The case of a 63-year-old man with a widespread retroperitoneal tumor and two tumor nodules in the left testis is described.	1.0924171741745825
Histopathological and cytopathological examination of tissue from the retroperitoneal tumor led to a diagnosis of lymphoreticular neoplasia.	0.9143443875260058
The patient died in acute cardiac failure, five weeks after initial presentation.	1.2006505203279434
Autopsy revealed another tumor nodule in the right atrium.	0.8024697280841917
Macroscopically, the bone marrow appeared normal.	1.1251799671158897
The tumor cells were reactive for CD45, vimentin and chloroacetate esterase, but were unreactive with a broad spectrum of antibodies against myelomonocytic and lymphocytic antigens and antibodies against tryptase and c-kit (CD117), characteristic markers for mast cells.	1.0938283146805095
However, the bone marrow exhibited the typical picture of mastocytosis.	1.1676988196135254
A diagnosis of bone marrow mastocytosis with an associated secondary extramedullary mast cell sarcoma was established.	0.9526110333101092
The cause of death was heart failure due to arrhythmia caused by an exophytic atrioseptal tumor nodule.	0.8685906519875888
Thrombembolic events as paraneoplastic complications in malignant disease account for severe morbidity and mortality in these patients.	0.9980885739369891
In some cases disturbance in hemostasis is the first manifestation of a neoplastic process.	1.014948128554044
We report the cases of two patients with cerebral and extracerebral vessel occlusions, in whom epithelial tumors of low malignant potential (borderline-tumors) of ovar and peritoneum were diagnosed later on.	1.2874636395720251
In one case the removal of the tumor stopped the coagulation problems.	1.1377263456677797
The second patient died a few days after the first symptoms with devastating multiple vessel occlusion.	1.055629685585809
In stroke of unknown aetiology a paraneoplastic process should be kept in mind.	0.8249610699817777
The diagnosis is more probable with recurrent thrombembolism in different body regions and when warfarin therapie was ineffective.	0.9344465839312474
Thoughtful coagulation studies and a tumor search program is recommended in these cases.	1.0179487567857697
Brain-stem gliomas occur mainly in childhood and are localized in the mesencephalon, pons and medulla oblongata.	0.9467414289972924
Diagnosis is a domain of MRI, requiring T2, T1 and KM.	0.9412569729395573
CT shows hemorrhage and calcification well.	0.6124014178905107
The criteria are the primary site, size, tumor growth, brain-stem enlargement, delineation, intralesional structure, exophytic components and enhancement.	1.0144477995892276
Secondary criteria are herniation, hydrocephalus and liquorgenic seeding.	0.7863934816424089
In CT glioma are hypodense, in MRI hyperintense in T2 and hypointense in T1.	0.8996049517592888
Enhancement is seen in 25-60% and does not allow differentiation of tumor vs nontumor or gradings.	1.0891022995592132
Factors influencing poor outcome are high grade, a short history, cranial nerve involvement, severe brain-stem enlargement, pontine site, diffuse growth and recurrency.	1.082963907650299
The 5-year-survival rate is 30% (after radiation: focal tumors 85%, diffuse 20%).	1.3348057361138264
Most frequent are symptoms of brain pressure, cerebellum, cranial nerves and pyramidal tract.	0.9100068049062797
There is no agreement on whether biopsy is necessary or not.	0.8032706237199814
A diagnosis of tumor is highly suggestive if classical MRI findings fit the clinical history.	0.9756463204325783
Radiobiological and physical examinations suggest clinical advantages of heavy ion irradiation.	0.7919802390170879
We report the result of 23 women and 22 men (median age 48 years) with skull base tumors irradiated with carbon ion beams at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI), Darmstadt, from December 1997 until September 1999.	1.2167820294606269
The study included patients with chordomas (17), chondrosarcomas (10) and other skull base tumors (Table 1).	1.2902964887615593
It is the first time that the intensity-controlled rasterscan-technique and the application of positron-emission tomography (PET) for quality assurance was used.	1.1509458107010546
All patients had computed tomography for three-dimensional-treatment planning (Figure 1).	1.1146950278393468
Patients with chordomas and chondrosarcomas underwent fractionated carbon ion irradiation in 20 consecutive days (median total dose 60 GyE).	0.8598937044559999
Other histologies were treated with carbon ion boost of 15 to 18 GyE delivered to the macroscopeic tumor after fractionated stereotatic radiotherapy (median total dose 63 GyE).	0.8979527136615256
Mean follow-up was 9 months.	1.0893467908409364
Irradiation was well tolerated by all patients.	0.687953855398252
Partial tumor remission was seen in 7 patients (15,5%) (Figure 2).	1.2911703161243386
One-year local control rate was 94%.	0.9502329996528968
One patient (2,2%) deceased.	1.2599038440866226
No severe toxicity and no local recurrence within the treated volume were observed.	0.812935715894554
Clinical effectiveness and technical feasibility of this modality could clearly be demonstrated in our study.	0.9755711451237086
To evaluate the clinical relevance of the different beam modalities studies with larger patient numbers are necessary.	0.9949938139384366
To continue our project a new heavy ion acclerator exclusively for clinical use is planed to be constructed in Heidelberg.	0.8491522650119832
Indirect trauma to the shoulder and knee joint often results in injuries to the ligaments and the capsule, and more rarely in fractures.	1.00458127148126
Anterior shoulder dislocation is common.	0.6668379922256706
Over the last few years arthroscopic repair of the torn labrum has become established as the therapy of choice.	1.0587685666579578
Isolated ruptures of the collateral ligaments of the knee can be treated functionally.	1.1308991227886114
A torn anterior cruciate ligament of the knee joint can be compensated by the quadriceps muscle if this is adequately prepared by special exercises.	1.0032233155757575
Chronic or combined instabilities should be treated surgically by ACI grafting techniques.	0.9713302388498033
Menisceal injuries are treated arthroscopically.	0.7027459824878673
Objective: Comparison of low back pain (LBP) patients with and without fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) with regard to affective distress.	1.0034233145381475
Methods: Patients with LBP who had been admitted to various clinics in Germany were examined upon admission.	1.1451779224764098
Comparisons were done by dividing the patients into groups with and without signs of FMS.	0.8198757802705201
Additionally, both groups were compared after being matched according to sex, age, and pain severity.	1.3150222124449176
Results: 15 out of 135 LBP patients met the American College of Rheumatology criteria for fibromyalgia.	0.9708825961507287
Patients with FMS showed remarkably higher levels of pain severity and affective distress.	0.783719611975455
After controlling for different levels of pain severity, these pronounced differences disappeared.	0.9723492371853354
Conclusion: Affective distress is not a unique feature of FMS, but seem to be caused entirely by higher levels of pain severity.	1.272618341452757
Methods: Cases of invasive HI-infections were reported in a national active surveillance program.	1.1170575189321141
The case definition required the typical clinical picture and a HI positive culture from a physiologically sterile site (or throat swab or tracheal aspirate in case of epiglottitis or pneumonia) in children up to 10 years.	1.112900214240376
All initial reports were validated with a questionnaire that additionally questioned the vaccination status, type of vaccine, therapy, outcome of the disease and characteristics of the bacteria.	1.1905564662376378
The relation between the type of Hib vaccine used on the risk of infection was analysed in a case control study with controls selected at random from a population based sampling frame.	1.0925879468164204
Results: 310 confirmed cases of invasive HI infections were reported during the observation period, 199 of these with meningitis, 56 with epiglottitis.	0.9629845595758678
The number of cases declined from 71 in the last six months of 1992, 120 in 1993, and 65 in 1994 to 54 cases in 1995.	1.1458650771517964
In 1995 the incidence in up to 5 year old children was 1.1/100 000 for all infection sites and 0.7/100 000 for meningitis.	1.2201195369343054
The reduced rates were mainly due to a decrease in the number of unvaccinated cases, whereas the number of cases in vaccinated children fluctuated between 22 and 36 per year.	1.0497703588216145
Most of these were observed in incompletely vaccinated children, who according to the German recommendations could already have received at least one further vaccination at the time of the infection.	1.2628485732825574
The type of vaccine (HbOC, PRP-D or OMP) was not significantly associated with the risk of infection in vaccinated children.	1.139911924167708
10 % of the bacteria produced betalactamase.	1.2109117181220446
In accordance with the German recommendations third generation cephalosporines were used in almost all cases of meningitis.	1.0715102891767418
One third of these, however, received additional antibiotics.	1.213515903863656
Conclusions: The present incidence of systemic HI infections in Germany is low.	1.223496867601408
A further decrease, however, would be possible with "on time" completion of the vaccination schedule according to the German recommendations in all children.	1.2058947475212822
For more than a century peritoneal adhesions are being recognized as frequent sequelae following abdominal surgery.	0.8304995396417284
Intraoperative lesions of the mesothelial lining by abrasion, ischemia, dissication, and foreign bodies result in complaints, intestinal obstruction, female infertility, and problems during reoperations.	0.9863116533498979
The global increase of life expectancy and surgical procedures are leading to rising incidences of adhesion-related complications and subsequent socio-economic implications.	1.015912224109119
As of today, there is no safe and efficient prophylaxis available.	1.0050056465084993
Scientific efforts should be aimed at a liquid substance for single intraperitoneal application which significantly reduces postoperative adhesions at reasonable cost without adverse effects on blood coagulation and wound healing.	0.8296480539645062
Even today the name of F. D. von Recklinghausen is often mentioned in connection with primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism.	0.7981739910875413
He was one of the first physicians and scientists to render outstanding services to the classification of structural changes of bones, and in many aspects his work remains valid today.	1.223313748646193
He succeeded through precise and comparative studies in making the disease and symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism known and thus distinguishing it from other known structural bone diseases.	1.0510543923126758
He also described the phenomenon of "bone remodeling" which has become relevant today again.	1.0753794597837862
Although his written macroscopic and microscopic observations include meticulously precise differentiations which make it difficult to study them today, they are still of interest in order to follow his basic ideas.	0.9881364967932303
This article does not constitute a comprehensive biography, but it contains a description of F. D. von Recklinghausen's important work on bone pathology against the background of the main stages of his life.	0.9981899984684848
Soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) of the extremities are characterized by a high rate of local recurrences.	1.1459160725560593
Limb salvage approaches using multimodality therapy protocols have replaced amputation.	0.6558954169688137
In order to evaluate isolated hyperthermic limb perfusion (ILP) in a multimodality therapy concept, we reviewed our patients treated using this method.	1.262250193295617
Between January 1982 and December 1995, 25 ILPs, using cisplatin, melphalan and adriamycin, were performed in 22 patients with STS.	1.1217324490727099
Forty percent were treated for local recurrences; histology was dominated by malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) and synovial sarcoma.	0.9721619013610107
In all, 68 % of the STS were classified as UICC stage IIb or IIIa/b.	0.9229015523174067
Most of the cases (14) underwent wide or radical resection, 4 patients received intraoperative radiotherapy, and 5 were treated with external beam radiation.	1.34627726480714
Complications were recorded in 32 % of the cases.	0.9579098300889396
With a median follow-up of 45 months (range 1-143), the 5-year overall survival rate was 81 %.	1.2338824951045742
The median recurrence-free time was 19 months and the 5-year disease-free survival rate 34 %.	1.091565978037126
There were 13 local failures, and distant metastases developed in 36 % of the patients.	1.0248649042436
Concerning high-grade sarcomas (UICC stage IIb, IIIa/b), we found local recurrences in 75 % of all cases.	1.3213155852158522
Five of 11 patients with local failures underwent perfusion after they refused amputation, and 7 incompletely resected STS received ILP without reoperation.	0.9936216455221097
All of these demonstrated local recurrence.	0.7697609668402523
This rate of local recurrence proved to be different from patients with tumor-free resection margins (p = 0.0001, log-rank test).	0.9761549461601812
The amputation rate after isolated limb perfusion was 27 % (mean 11 months after treatment).	1.2180032480212597
Long-term results of ILP showed a considerable local recurrence rate and a low disease-free survival.	1.198451293659791
Perfusion in patients without tumor-free resection margins does not prevent local recurrence.	1.0112668661732287
We conclude that ILP with cisplatin, melphalan and adriamycin should be considered carefully and is not an additional treatment strategy of first choice.	1.1816262627685763
Infections with the grampositive bacterium Clostridium difficile occurs mostly in worst ill, multimorbide patients treated with cytostatica or antibiotics.	0.7608299347690406
We report about two healthy children with pseudomembranous colitis caused by Clostridium difficile without an underlying illness or a former history of antibiotic treatment.	0.9185280814882785
Huntington's disease (HD) may cause considerable diagnostic problems because of the highly variable clinical features, especially at the beginning of the illness.	1.0845127604025206
We report the case of a 21-year-old woman with definite HD whose main symptoms were psychopathological changes that were misinterpreted as schizophrenia for 7 years.	0.8926808063833536
One reason for this misdiagnosis was the unusual, very early onset and the remarkable earlier age of onset of HD compared with that of other affected relatives.	1.0307815188225897
The phenomenon of earlier onset within one affected family is well documented in the literature in cases with the paternally transmitted mutated gene.	1.0287377782962508
Diagnostic landmarks were consideration of the initially mild disturbances of movement and the once again repeated detailed examination of the family history.	1.0323256712084332
ICD-10 is to be implemented for morbidity coding in Germany soon.	0.908477612827071
The electronic versions of ICD-10 are introduced.	0.42513341341485733
For everyday work with the classification and for epidemiological research further tools are provided by DIMDI: ICD-10 meta files, ICD conversion tables, ICD-10 thesaurus of diagnostic terms.	0.47326761423494534
All files are available free of charge via the INTERNET.	0.36041979684062686
Because of poorly compartmentalized paraclavicular soft tissues, total extraperiostal claviculectomy in cases of malignoma with cortical destruction is always marginal.	0.7931868164337609
Due to different muscular compensation in the patients examined, literature disagrees on the biomechanical consequences of claviculectomy for the shoulder girdle.	0.9722823468500353
Thrombolytic therapy of pulmonary embolism with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) has proved to be an established method; but intra- and postoperatively, there is a high risk of bleeding complications.	1.2678394837366371
A 50-year old female with familiar hypophosphatasia and suspected deep venous thrombosis was undergoing osteosynthesis of a femoral fracture.	0.9102437796603563
Intraoperatively, petCO2 suddenly dropped, paCO2 rose, and circulatory arrest occurred.	0.8772834041836586
CPR was started immediately with closed-chest cardiac compression and intravenous application of catecholamines.	0.8976394796932105
While continuing CPR, surgery was stopped, the wound was sealed provisionally, and the patient was transferred to the ICU.	1.199601171248776
Because of suspected massive pulmonary embolism, thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA in a total dosage of 100 mg was begun.	0.9162700099676102
2.25 hours after the onset of circultory arrest, and 1.5 hours after the beginning of thrombolysis, the patient's hemodynamic patterns under high-dosage catecholamines were satisfactory.	1.1855632229852469
The bleeding after thrombolysis and coagulopathy required massive blood transfusions.	0.6807036128724355
The situation was also complicated by lesions of the liver, spleen and small intestines, which required surgical intervention, and acute renal failure, which had to be treated with transient hemofiltration.	1.2345788079122189
Twenty-eight days after receiving CPR, the patient was discharged from the ICU.	1.1437272318016343
A diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was established by clinical signs, capnometry, blood gas analysis, and electrocardiography.	1.1575039185848224
Due to the requirements of the emergency situation (ongoing CPR), further diagnostic tools were not used.	1.2980064377301486
The patient survived without any neurological deficiency, despite the extended 135-min use of CPR, and despite massive bleeding due to surgical trauma, and to performing CPR in the presence of fibrinolytica.	1.0882492832123636
With the increasing use of cross-sectional echocardiography in patients with overt or suspected pulmonary thromboembolism in the emergency rooms, more and more right atrial thrombi are detected.	1.075824141421729
These are so-called "transitthrombi" from the venous system on their way to the pulmonary arteries and they are a severe presentation of thromboembolic disease.	1.1068363563476913
They appear as an imminent pulmonary embolism and usually coexists with an already massive embolism.	0.8854725105993657
In patients were a right atrial thrombus is associated with a patent foramen ovale, paradoxical arterial embolism has been observed.	0.9576768389273049
Right sided heart thrombi have a high mortality rate and need immediate treatment.	0.9995758366526136
In our hospital we have seen 14 patients with right atrial thrombi and pulmonary embolism in a period of 6 years.	1.2121632420907718
Three patients had cardiac arrest with a massive pulmonary embolism, seven patients presented with a submassive embolism.	1.0195087125717408
All patients were treated immediately after echocardiographic diagnosis without pulmonary angiography.	1.0386351274413401
In about half of the cases transesophageal echocardiography was done additionally for diagnosis and monitoring.	1.1066436949580898
Therapeutic options were thrombectomy, fibrinolysis or anticoagulants.	0.702997328765987
We treated one of our patients with thrombectomy, eleven patients with fibrinolysis and two patients with anticoagulants.	1.117813296353131
The era of modern anaesthesia in Germany began on January 24th, 1847.	0.9113926374653686
This day, professor in ordinary Johann Ferdinand Heyfelder anaesthetized a patient with sulphuric ether in the clinic of surgery and ophthalmology of the University of Erlangen.	1.0095144426070424
By March 17th, 1847, Heyfelder had performed 121 surgical procedures under ether.	0.7550765455188211
The operations in majority were teeth-extractions, and a few more complex operations such as the treatment of a harelip or of lip cancer or the resection of the shoulder joint.	1.1925287646938771
Heyfelder described in detail 108 of these inhalations in a little book entitled The experiments with sulphuric ether.	0.8440185639323139
This monograph published in March, 1847, represents one of the first complete dissertations on sulphuric ether in the German literature.	1.0065245629794455
In a special chapter he analyzed the development of various physiological and psychological parameters during etherization.	0.9604278075968987
Heyfelder also examined blood and urine of some etherized patients and reported that he did not find any important or specific alterations.	0.9200887371967162
In 1847, Heyfelder was probably the first to apply salt-ether in man.	1.0110153723728548
After 4 administrations he concluded that salt ether acted more quickly but shorter than sulphuric ether.	0.763546648128643
Advantageous were its application without problems and ease of induction.	0.7418635234877455
Disadvantageous were its high volatility, its price and the difficulty of getting it in a pure form.	0.9951107772846355
From December, 1847, on Heyfelder started to use chloroform.	0.9321918582346065
He was now able to perform more major operations, for example the total resection of the hip-joint.	1.108777869882964
In his book The experiments with sulphuric ether, salt ether, and chloroform he describes a great number of anaesthetic administrations using these 3 agents.	0.8704902148717958
In his summary Heyfelder concluded, that chloroform was undoubtly superior to sulphuric ether mainly because it was a quicker acting and longer lasting agent and leads to deeper narcosis.	0.9252107581837105
Moreover its application was much easier for it needed no special apparatus.	0.7925477144181355
However, because of its great anaesthetic potency, Heyfelder particularly demanded great caution in the application of chloroform.	1.209093881910876
Explicitely he expected an assistant for chloroformizations, whose only duty was to supervise the inhalations and the patient - a forerunner of the modern specialized anaesthesiologist.	1.1360875944243485
Background: To evaluate the publication rate of abstracts presented during the German Anaesthesia Congress (DAK) in MEDLINE-listed journals in comparison to the publication rate of abstracts presented during the meeting of the European Society of Anaesthesiologists (ESA).	1.0646954030900522
The uniform development of the human embryo, as described by classic human embryology, has been confirmed by sonoembryological studies.	1.2112472610259453
In particular, the embryonic brain is suitable for transvaginal ultrasound examination, because the large "cystic" cavities of the brain can easily be imaged.	1.1291988152412364
Sonoembryology not only describes normal embryonic anatomy and normal relations and proportions of organs, but also the development of structural abnormalities.	1.1164537138510187
Approximately one-third of all congenital anomalies, originate from the central nervous system (CNS).	0.6869604710547353
Based on normal sonoembryology and on recent experiences with early CNS anomalies, we recognize some sonographic signs of an early CNS anomaly: (1) Apparent dysmorphology of the brain or the head; (2) Altered appearance of the cerebral ventricles with disproportion of the brain compartments, where the amount of fluid is either greater or less than normal; (3) In the early fetal period, choroid plexuses that are too small to fill the ventricle from the medial to the lateral wall; (4) Irregular contour of the spine/back; (5) Extra-CNS anomalies.	1.1676477845744613
In the following survey, normal sonoembryology of the CNS is described, and CNS anomalies of the early pregnancy are discussed.	1.164072493711088
Telomerase is an enzyme that elongates telomeric repeats, the specialized structures at the ends of chromosomes that provide genomic stability and compensate for the physiologic process of telomere shortening.	0.860273226603884
It has been implicated in cellular senescence, immortalization, and carcinogenesis.	1.0163355090280324
Over 85% of human tumours, and 95% of non-melanocytic skin cancers, show telomerase activity, in contrast to the corresponding normal tissues.	1.3238957341658166
This suggests that telomerase activity may play an important role in carcinogenesis.	0.8167798678718375
Recent evidence shows that telomerase is active not only in embryonal and germ line tissues, but also in some normal tissues.	1.0714707594710449
In the skin, this activity has been traced to the stem-cell-bearing epidermal basal cell layer, possibly reflecting the presence of telomerase-competent stem cells.	1.052952077459129
These findings require a reconsideration of our interpretation of telomerase activity in tumours of the skin and other tissues.	1.001989433271833
As a causal relationship linking telomerase activity and cancer has yet not been demonstrated, some caution is warranted.	0.9272981679275244
The established criteria of auditory brainstem responses (ABR) such as JV latency, JI-V interpeak latency and interaural differences of  latency or amplitude have been found to be sensitive for detecting tumors of the cerebellopontine angle if a response is present.	0.9572312277332742
However, the ABR can be absent in cases of acoustic neuromas because of desynchronization, even though pure-one audiometry indicates that responses should be present.	1.0861197726994603
This retrospective study compared the ABR and pure-tone thresholds in 234 cases with cerebellopontine angle tumors and a control group of 181 cases with sensory hearing losses in order to quantify threshold discrepancies.	1.0306975887609395
The average deficit of the objective ABR threshold (DOABRT) to the subjective pure-tone threshold for those frequencies between 1-6 kHz was 3.6 dB for the control group (ABR and pure tone thresholds very close) and 31.2 dB for the tumor group (ABR threshold much higher than the pure-tone threshold).	1.2109527968982503
ABR thresholds 30 dB higher than the high-frequency pure tone thresholds were found in 40.6% of the tumor group and in none of the control group.	1.3344731028127004
Thus, deficits of the ABR threshold >30 dB can be considered to be an additional criterion for detecting retrocochlear disease and increases ABR sensitivity for tumor detection even if responses are absent.	1.2103557248375387
The association of nevus flammeus with mongolian spot, nevus fuscoceruleus, nevus spilus and, with variable frequency, with nevus anemicus has been termed phacomatosis pigmentovascularis, a genodermatosis first described by Ota and co-workers.	1.0855250104410261
Four different combinations have been specified.	0.5845113949868684
Most cases are reported from the Japanese literature.	0.9882939252927954
Phacomatosis pigmentovascularis may constitute an exclusively cutaneous disorder, but overlapping with other syndromes like Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome or Sturge-Weber syndrome is also possible.	0.9260319025089672
We report a 30-year-old woman with nevus flammeus on the back and right arm associated with nevus fuscoceruleus on the back.	1.1695809824140206
ORIF management of unstable trochanteric fractures of type A3 of the A0 classification is difficult because of lateral dislocation of the proximal fractured segments, particularly when only the sliding hip-screw is used for fixation.	1.09486142664661
A connectable butt-press plate was recently developed in order to prevent this type of dislocation.	0.9798904720662972
We review the results with this fixation technique in 22 elderly patients with an average age of 76 years who presented with highly unstable trochanteric fracture of the A3 type.	1.1486276341079118
Three patients died of diseases unrelated to the trauma or operation before the fractures had healed.	0.9826158870839246
The other 19 were followed prospectively until fracture healing had occurred.	0.7901547708485657
Complaints, leg shortening and changes in the CCD angle were recorded.	0.8134678570038341
Furthermore, the mobility score was determined.	1.0356478208863065
Although the patients were able to bear full weight after the operation, no lateral dislocation of fragments was observed.	1.0044957685661862
Only 1 patient had a varus dislocation of 5  ° until the fracture had consolidated.	1.0457214026207697
This was due to severe osteopenia and subsequent dislocation of the screw within the femoral head.	0.8734518640341956
No pseudarthrosis, osteitis or rotational malalignment was noted.	0.7936167379447651
Five of the surviving patients had a lower mobility score after fracture healing as compared to the status before the fracture was sustained.	1.0635813380643675
On the basis of this review, we recommend the use of this new connectable buttress plate with sliding hip screws because it provides sifficient fixation of highly unstable fractures of type A3.	1.2171088507767973
Superficial leptomeningeal hemosiderosis is a rare disease of the central nervous system.	0.9207394954366162
Chronic bleeding into the subarachnoid space causes deposition of hemosiderin in glial cells and subsequent damage to adjacent brain tissue.	0.7702679171318175
There is a characteristic predilection for the cerebellum and eighth cranial nerve.	0.8902977341735373
Accordingly, among a variety of symptoms, cerebellar ataxia and sensorineural hearing loss progressing to total deafness commonly occur.	1.0078983193222426
To date, the hearing loss has been believed to be purely neural.	0.9160198727475378
We present a case of superficial hemosiderosis in a patient with total deafness who was successfully provided with a cochlear implant.	1.027320535499072
Audiometry demonstrated total bilateral cochlear hearing losses but with preserved function of the eighth cranial nerve.	0.7902226327759632
These findings make us conclude that in contrast to current opinion, superficial hemosiderosis can initially damage the cochlea alone.	1.023256301340348
Thus, patients with total deafness due to this disorder may benefit from cochlear implantation.	1.1793989486213778
All patients require careful audiometric assessment, including promontory stimulation.	0.925814783564336
Intracardiac masses remain a challenge for imaging diagnosis.	0.7417992339772644
Although most lesions are initially detected by echocardiography, additional imaging studies, i.e., magnetic resonance imaging and electron beam computed tomography, are commonly requested.	1.092555782580143
Features and limitations of these two imaging techniques are illustrated and briefly analyzed.	0.9817664845396674
For the first time, the present study assessed the achievable predictive value of early self-experienced neuropsychological deficits for the fater development of schizophrenia.	1.0415641305073626
Ninety-six patients with DSM-III-R diagnoses mainly of the formerly neurotic or personality disordered field, of whom 81 % had shown such basic disorders at the time of the index examination and therefore were classified as persons at high risk of developing schizophrenia, were re-examined for schizophrenia.	1.1905023006520161
After an average follow-up period of about 8 years, more than half of the re-examined sample had developed a schizophrenic disorder according to DSM-III-R.	1.0146617655938213
The outcome of schizophrenia versus no schizophrenia was predicted correctly in 77 % of cases by the presence or absence of self-experienced disturbances of perception, thought, speech or action.	1.0903165469420208
To date, at least 12 types of primary dystonia can be distinguished on a genetic basis.	1.190603450810243
A 3-bp deletion in the DYT1 gene causes early onset, generalized torsion dystonia (TD), and mutations in the GTP cyclohydrolase I and the tyrosine hydroxylase genes result in dopa-responsive dystonia (DYT5).	0.9243005711287253
A missense change in the D2 dopamine receptor in one large family (DYT11) has recently been implicated in myoclonus-dystonia.	0.9410715019644483
Furthermore, seven other loci for dystonia genes have been mapped to chromosomal regions, including a locus for a mixed dystonia phenotype (DYT6), one form of focal dystonia (DYT7), three types of paroxysmal dystonia (DYT8-10), X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (DYT3), and rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (DYT12).	1.2222670421654096
No positive linkage results have yet been obtained for autosomal recessive TD (DYT2) and several other families of different types of dominantly inherited TD (DYT4).	0.9231132025937105
In addition, hereditary secondary dystonia may occur as part of familial diseases of the basal ganglia, metabolic and storage disorders, and various X-linked and other familial neurodegenerative syndromes affecting the basal ganglia.	1.1075617840031704
It may be anticipated that the traditional clinical and etiological classifications of dystonia will increasingly be replaced by a genetic one and that the identification of more dystonia genes may lead to a better understanding of these largely nondegenerative disorders.	0.9831848908335671
In this study we investigated whether, in conjunction with neuroleptics, a psychoeducational and cognitively oriented treatment for schizophrenic outpatients and their key-persons can improve the course of schizophrenic illness within a 2-year follow-up.	1.1664077266835746
This prospective randomized study covered a total of 191 schizophrenic patients (according to DSM-III-R) and comprised a psychoeducational training and cognitive psychotherapy for patients and counseling for their key persons in various combinations.	1.0370537237805786
Patients were examined before, immediately after and 2 years after the end of the intervention.	1.0797765221406148
Patients in the treatment groups reduced their overall psychopathology and their attention deficit.	1.1643382984537067
For patients receiving all three treatment conditions, there was a relevant preventive effect with regard to the rehospitalization rate appearing during the second year of the follow-up.	1.0364048410529185
We conclude that in the mid-term, a combination of psychoeducational and cognitively oriented therapy for patients and their keypersons can improve the course of schizophrenic illness.	1.1897888928706635
Background: Cigarette smoking is common during pregnancy and can expose the developing fetus to transplacental carcinogens, but relatively little information is available on fetal uptake of such compounds.	1.084387398400963
It was the aim of the present study to analyze the first urine of newborns of mothers who did or did not smoke for metabolites of the tobacco-specific carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) as well as nicotine and cotinine.	1.2478673154921167
Recently there has been an increase in the prevalent HIV infected population in Germany because of declines in progression to AIDS and death while the number of newly infected patients remains constant.This increases the potential value of both current and new approaches to disease prevention.	1.0213778196783005
Post exposure prophylaxis (PEP), defined as treatment of a person who has been exposed to an HIV infected person by a route through which transmission is possible, is one possible way to decrease the number of new cases.	1.15864960143938
Economic evaluation can help to answer the question whether PEP should be provided to different exposed populations or whether the resources that would be used for PEP should be used for other HIV prevention or treatment interventions.The value of PEP depends both on the costs and effectiveness of the intervention.	1.037958522236291
In this paper, we use examples from the literature to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of PEP in different population subgroups, including those occupationally exposed, those exposed through unprotected sex, and those exposed through IV drug use.	1.1981629278573138
The cost-effectiveness of PEP is also compared to literature estimates of the cost-effectiveness of other prevention activities.	0.9869324836380734
The aim of this study was to access the importance of the laparoscopic colorectal resection.	0.9768236712970088
Of 131 patients 80 were operated on laparoscopically.	0.6988144016632208
The conversion rate was 14 % (13/93).	1.173236641907033
A total of 47 patients suffered from cancer.	0.86775503318658
Curative resection was performed in 41 patients (87 %).	0.9343279248291596
For comparison, 48 patients who underwent open resection were used.	0.9964723383866798
The complication rate was lower after laparoscopy and no reoperation was performed.	0.8395897072363869
Patients recovered quicker and their first oral food intake and bowel movement were earlier.	0.8028152909942329
Hospital stay was shorter (15.3 vs. 8.1 days), and pain at rest and in motion was significantly reduced.	1.2335298706976598
Equal numbers of mesenteric lymph nodes were retrieved; adequate margins of resection could be obtained and the length of resected bowel did not differ.	0.9858919846197067
No port metastases were observed.	0.5664177220504136
Reduced morbidity, reduced hospital stay, reduced abdominal pain, quicker reconvalescence, and reduced overall health care costs are strong arguments in favor of laparoscopic colectomy.	1.1136167104906096
In the field of traumatology, compartment syndromes of the lower extremity are often seen after fractures and direct injuries, or after ischaemia.	1.142607176642157
Other causes include over-exertion and non-traumatic causes such as acute rhabdomyolysis, drug-induced myositis and eosinophilic myositis.	0.8857952892206464
This paper describes the clinical and MR course of a compartment syndrome following an ankle sprain.	0.9732396957526334
Each patient has the right of a dedicated pain therapy according to the state of the art.	1.0443231399507298
However an efficient pain therapy is not possible without knowing the cause of pain.	1.0602523209066428
In most posttraumatic pain situations peripheral nociceptors are activated and normal afferences are conducted via an intact nociceptive system.	0.803489584102288
In contrast, neuropathic pain pain is caused by lesions of the nervous system itself.	0.8993242193129249
Mechanisms of central sensibilization and involvement of the sympathetic nervous system may lead to chronification of such pain conditions.	0.7701043122518263
The therapeutic regime of nociceptive and neuropathic pain is demonstrated by algorithms of treatment modalities.	0.8920004853990849
Apart from classic non-opioid analgesics, co-analgesics and opioids have an important status in chronic pain management as well.	0.9516988711814822
Prescription of these substances has to follow strictly defined standards of pain therapy.	0.82793981004872
Blockades with local anaesthetics as mono-therapy of chronic pain are obsolete.	0.9692035496059278
In posttraumatic pain, however, a certain number of adjuvant blockades or infiltrations of triggerpoints may be helpful.	1.0232114058402093
The exeptional place of sympathetic blockades are in diagnosis and therapy of sympathetic maintained pain (SMP).	0.7363395149586197
Effects of 94 different psychosocial and psychotherapeutic interventions on well-being in the elderly were meta-analyzed.	1.0174597923941986
Psychological well-being was improved and self-rated depression decreased for about half a standard deviation.	1.006649073122487
The mean effect size for other-rated depression reached d=1.15.	0.7162581558914926
Whereas age of participants did not correlate with change in self-rated well-being or depression, other-rated depression improved less in older samples.	1.035271566427787
High effect sizes derived from control-enhancing interventions and behavior therapy.	0.7774619558467931
Sub-analyses showed that individual setting produced higher improvement than group setting.	0.7271318323577269
Higher "therapeutic" qualifications and interventions in nursing homes were associated with higher effect-sizes too.	0.827406227705793
Implications for planning inteventions in old age are discussed.	0.7656578053138062
The prognosis of laryngeal carcinoma worsens dramatically with the discovery of primary or secondary lymph node metastases.	0.9874084215253611
Thus consistent prophylaxis and therapy of metastases is indispensable.	0.9077174940952517
The standard therapy of manifest cervical lymph node metastases is surgery, if possible using the approach of conservative neck dissection.	1.143145625870927
In cases of a lymph node stage N3, i.e.	0.6714029468641224

Objective: The German Ophthalmologic Society is rising to the challenges of the information age by offering comprehensive information resources online.	1.0173230031536116
Human recombinant interleukin 2 (IL-2), alone or in combination with other cytokines, is currently under investigation for the immunotherapy of metastatic tumours.	1.1533683297137534
Objective responses of 20%-35% have been reported in patients with disseminated melanoma and renal cell carcinoma who received high-dose intravenous IL-2 in combination with interferon- (IFN).	1.3323050321687344
However, treatment with IL-2 is complicated by a syndrome of life-threatening adverse reactions such as disseminated vascular leakage, fluid retention, severe hypotension, and (reversible) multiple organ dysfunction (MODS).	1.2144549600001118
A systemic inflammatory reaction (SIRS)/sepsis sepsis-like haemodynamic pattern has been described in patients after IL-2 bolus application alone.	1.1742503557790793
Our purpose was to study the haemodynamic changes in patients treated with high-dose IL-2 administered as a constant infusion and in combination with IFN.	1.0822229618787562
The histopathologic diagnosis of odontogenic cysts is based mainly on the morphological nature of the epithelial lining of cysts and their origin.	1.0630646302207094
We used the international histologic classification set up by the World Health Organisation in 1992.	0.8442232972682986
The aim of this study was to investigate the differentiation of various types of cyst using an immunohistochemical technique rather than by conventional morphological assessment.	0.9137901024829466
About five per cent of the children with congenital diaphragmatic hernia are asymptomatic during parturition and are diagnosed beyond the neonatal period.	0.9638728171573917
We report about particularities of "late-presenters" with congenital diaphragmatic hernias namely funnel chest and a fatal outcome of an associated acute gastric volvulus.	1.08372757040858
The retrospective results of carbon prostheses for knee ligament reconstruction in 120 patients, as established by questionnaire, are reported at 10  +/-  2 years follow-up.	1.2109714263803948
Eighty patients could also be reviewed clinically.	0.800110741482052
Some 60 % of the patients showed good subjective function at reduced activity level.	1.0534474347491796
Complications were seen in 72.5 % of the patients with rupture of the carbon prosthesis and in 68 % of those with synovitis.	1.2399142927290363
X-ray showed osteoarthritis in up to 59 % of the patients.	0.9494036193792544
Carbon prostheses for collateral ligament reconstruction (85 % medial, 5.8 % lateral) were successful in 75 % of cases.	1.253807012272857
Activity and time seem to be less responsible for failure of the carbon prostheses than the features of growing in.	1.0024933050334994
Destruction of the knee joint over time is due to reactive synovitis and catabolic enzyme reaction and correlates with joint effusion and pain.	0.8699987333645169
If these problems appear, (arthroscopic) resection of the synovia is indicated to interrupt the circulus vitiosus.	1.0040590741727944
Background: With resprect to very early screening it has become necessary to apply laboratory techniques more sensitive and more precise than the formerly used Guthrie-test to guarantee correct detection of hyperphenylalaninemias.	1.1172295499168683
Three quantitative methods were compared.	0.5702418594728115
The Viennese Medical School played an important role in the development of radiological examinations and signs of the temporal bone with conventional X-rays.	0.9265801181029237
Famous pioneers include E. G. Mayer (1893-1969) and L. Psenner (1910-1986).	0.9407519210964603
Nowadays conventional X-rays and tomography have lost their important role in diagnostic radiology of the temporal bone, but the basic principles established in those early years of radiology are still used now.	1.2391083368968994
This statement is correct not only for conventional X-rays, but particularly for "poly"-tomography in comparison with CT.	1.209405595050979
The success of interventional catheter based therapy of coronary artery disease is still limited by a high rate of chronic restenosis.	1.1194768502547892
Using alternative mechanical techniques, there is increasing evidence that restenosis can be prevented in certain subsets of patients by optimized balloon angioplasty, DCA and stenting as well as by the combined approach of primary tissue removal with adjunctive stent implantation.	1.06332359234044
This article summarizes the mechanical techniques of restenosis prevention or reduction that have been documented in controlled trials.	0.9149396530687417
Additional pharmacologic interventions and possibly genetic and/or radiotherapeutic approaches will be highly important for future reduction of restenosis.	0.8649270584652203
A safe closure of a dura lesion is necessary on account of the risk of potentially fatal (late) meningitis.	0.9147999389549142
161 duraplasties of the frontal skull base carried out from 1979 to 1994 at the ENT-department Fulda were evaluated in a retrospective study in regard to etiology, operative techniques and results.	1.10694007207606
Duraplasty of the rhinobasis was indicated in 70 cases of rhinobasal trauma, 47 cases after paranasal sinus surgery, 36 cases of tumors and 8 malformations.	1.0155318317496007
After an average follow-up time of 6 years the patients were interviewed for postoperative liquorrhea, sinusitis treated with antibiotics and meningitis.	1.2221538364445852
As an objective measure to verify the tight closure of the treated CSF-leaks a fluoreszein test was performed in 50,9 % 6 to 8 weeks after the operation.	1.1224173371027246
Duraplasty was successfull in more than 96 %.	0.8184808072737606
The approach and technique to perform a duraplasty have to be choosen individually considering size, location and etiology of the dural defect.	0.936672593641147
In the majority of dural defects in the area of the frontal skull base reconstruction can be carried out now a days via an endonasal approach.	0.9601308828991727
By use of allogenic tissue, a mucosal flap from the surrounding area to cover the graft and fibrin clue good results were obtained.	1.0375827438565675
The tophus is a characteristic and pathognomonic sign of chronic gout.	0.9390842040340485
Before effective drugs were available for the treatment of hyperuricaemia about 50 - 60% of patients with gout developed clinically and radiologically apparent urate crystal deposits.	1.0509799889085822
Clinical cutaneous manifestations of chronic gout are now rarely observed.	0.836324154117727
However, the presence of degenerative tissues, as in idiopathic osteoarthritis of the fingers, may predispose to the deposition of urate crystals.	1.2151094716710804
We report on a patient with secondary - probably diuretic-induced - hyperuricaemia and gout tophi in Heberden's nodes.	1.0617611680931296
HIV-1-associated encephalopathy (HIVE) remains an important manifestation of advanced HIV infection despite recent progress in antiretroviral therapy.	1.0446732047647596
This is in part due to particular pharmacological and virological characteristics of the central nervous system (CNS).	0.7141521182327271
HIVE is characterized by a "subcortical" dementia with psychomotor slowing as well as memory and concentration deficits.	0.888414992424298
An invariable finding are deficits of central motor function.	0.6874705170875183
Pathogenetically, an enhanced viral replication in immunocompetent CNS cells is believed to be a requirement.	1.098404275575833
This leads to neurotoxic effects directly elicited by viral products as well as indirectly by the immune response to virus infection.	0.9252938672623867
HIV-1 myelopathy (HIVM) is the other CNS manifestion of late HIV infection.	1.1127155688950827

Background: Prognostic data heart failure rely on epidemiological studies or large clinical trials.	1.1083013221814793
These data are not to transfer easily on everyday practice.	0.9622289250107898
Forty-nine patients (mean age, 54 years) admitted for displaced ankle fractures were observed retrospectively to determine by clinical examination and measurement of plantar pressure distribution whether successful surgical treatment of ankle fractures had led to gait symmetry.	1.167694531368624
The mean follow-up was 36 months (range, 19-54 months).	0.997757725933789
The deviation in gait was quantified using peak pressure.	0.6521452948997278
Using a clinical score, most of the patients had satisfactory results.	1.2078959445721102
The plantar pressure distribution showed significant load asymmetries of patients with satisfactory results and those with non-satisfactory results.	0.9077498477551823
Dynamic gait analysis allows quantification of gait asymmetry and clinically non-visible gait disorder.	0.7956587063447522
Comparison of radiation exposure applied by different types of CT scanners for the investigation of the chest and abdomen.	0.8962669011711044
Determination of radiation exposure applied by multi-phase spiral CT. Estimation of the dose in air in the system axis of the scanner, the CT dose index (CTDI) and the effective dose for electron beam tomography (EBT) and two conventional CT scanners (sequence, SEQ; spiral, SCT).	1.1942508240758918
For EBT, dose in system axis for investigation of the abdomen was above 50 mGy.	0.9462325439535313
Effective dose for investigation of the chest and abdomen was higher with EBT (11 and 26 mSv, respectively) than with conventional CT (SEQ, 4 and 20 mSv; SCT, 2 and 7 mSv).	1.2578384018838944
The effective dose for a biphasic investigation (liver 5 mSv, kidney 4 mSv) was below, for a triphasic investigation (liver 7 mSv) above the effective dose of the investigastion of the abdomen (6 mSv).	1.1984860443505685
Investigation of the abdomen with the EBT should only be performed for certain indications.	1.148277582415985
With spiral CT, effective dose is much lower than with EBT.	1.0022738774132798
Bone fracture, soft-tissue trauma and hemorrhagic shock are frequent complications in trauma patients, and these patients are known to be immunocompromised.	1.0723011859551421
Nonetheless, it is difficult to differentiate the effect of soft-tissue trauma plus hemorrhage from that of bone fracture and hemorrhage on host immune function in the clinical setting.	1.1656813052824575
To determine this experimentally, closed bone fracture (right lower leg) and/or soft-tissue trauma (2.5 cm midline laparotomy) were induced prior to hemorrhagic shock (mean arterial BP of 35  +/-  5 mm Hg for 90 min) in male C3H/HeN mice.	1.2457302916343131
All animals were killed at 72 h after initiation of the experiment and the spleens were collected aseptically.	0.8517324909748172
More significant depression of splenocyte IL-2 and IL-3 release occurred with the combined insult than after bony injury or tissue trauma alone with hemorrhage.	1.0596480060009148
The present study suggests that different traumatic insults, i. e. bone fracture as well as soft-tissue trauma in conjunction with hemorrhagic shock, produce comparable depression of host immune function.	1.0643533846553384
Moreover, combination of closed bone fracture and soft-tissue trauma prior to hemorrhagic shock leads to even more compromised immunity.	1.100554935716753
This indicates that different mechanisms of immune depression may be involved following soft-tissue trauma or bony injury coupled with hemorrhage.	0.9946954629673435
The markedly depressed immune function following bony injury, soft-tissue trauma and hemorrhagic shock may contribute to the increased susceptibility of severely injured patients to sepsis and the ensuing multiple organ failure in the clinical situation.	1.0304961710007823
In the management of acute major vessel occlusion, the use of fibrinolytic agents such as recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), urokinase or streptokinase is widely accepted.	0.9205590152176482
Today, the spectrum of indications for thrombolytic drugs comprises acute myocardial infarction, lung embolism, ischaemic stroke, deep vein thrombosis and acute arterial occlusions of the lower limbs.	1.1611107396776532
In view of the histopathological and clinical features of retinal vessel occlusion, fibrinolysis aimed at early restoration of blood flow appears to be a promising therapeutic approach.	1.0443189617513167
Basically, it is of some concern that the systemic administration of fibrinolytic agents is associated with a haemorrhagic risk.	1.1812697987235814
Since this includes cerebral haemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding, the choice of an appropriate intravenous thrombolytic therapy in a non-life threatening situation such as central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) or central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) should be based on minimising the risk of adverse events.	1.0085093352575711
Furthermore, the fibrinolytic treatment of choice should be able to produce rapid and complete restoration of retinal capillary and arterial or venous blood flow and maintain patency long enough for retinal salvage to take place.	1.0885988786262402
In this article, we review several studies of fibrinolytic therapy in patients with retinal vessel occlusion to determine whether this treatment is likely to improve major clinical outcomes.	1.1425700627451207
Moreover, we review the large scale trials of fibrinolysis in myocardial infarction and acute ischaemic stroke to evaluate safety and efficacy of various thrombolytic regimens.	1.1217412650218759
Furthermore, we report on our results of fibrinolytic therapy with low dose rt-PA in patients with retinal artery occlusion and ischaemic central retinal vein occlusion.	1.3295562900542963
In light of the fact that the occurrence of bleeding complications constitutes a dose dependent problem, we conclude that the use of low dose regimens should be the ideal approach to fibrinolysis in retinal vessel occlusion.	1.1054668612607048
Although the results of our pilot studies must be interpreted with caution, we believe that the administration of low-dose rt-PA (50 mg) in a frontloaded manner ( = simultaneous administration of rt-PA and intravenous heparin) constitutes a reasonable treatment option in patients with central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) or ischaemic retinal vein occlusion (RVO), recent onset of symptoms (CRAO <= 12 h, RVO <= 11 d) and severe visual loss ( <= 20/50).	1.295826891421313
Because of these limitations and the numerous contraindications of fibrinolytic therapy, only a limited number of patients will be suitable for this treatment.	1.1449712204699871
In view of the poor visual and ocular prognosis in severe retinal vessel occlusion, controlled clinical trials are needed to determine the benefit of thrombolysis in the management of this disease.	1.08076208448179
This study was designed to determine the relationship between the electroencephalogram (EEG) and clinical signs of depth of anaesthesia during induction of anaesthesia by slow infusion of propofol (18 mg/kg - h).	1.168749474084653
The object of this study was to evaluate currently published data regarding extragenital neoplasia induced by HRT.	0.9209830482296838
Objective: This study was designed to investigate the differences between TIVA with propofol/remifentanil (P/R) and balanced anaesthesia with sevoflurane/fentanyl (S/F) in gynaecological laparoscopic surgery.	1.3413709995925607
Emphasis was put on haemodynamic reaction, recovery profile, postoperative side effects and patient satisfaction.	1.0384663404945569
Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis (CRP) is a rare dermatosis of unknown aetiology.	0.8674010278411376
Recent electron microscopic studies suggest that CRP is a disorder of keratinisation.	0.8571222660551143
In our case we could not confirm the previously reported ultrastructural findings.	1.0282623175283556
CRP is generally resistant to therapy.	0.6245624442549454
We treated a 19-year-old patient with typical CRP with oral minocycline.	1.020493710001453
Within a few weeks the eruption resolved completely.	0.8816822424441966
A mild relapse 7 months later responded promptly to a repeated course of minocycline.	0.8150642358185951
Twelve months after discontinuatin of therapy there is no evidence of recurrence.	0.927293061311028
In CRP minocycline should be preferred to systemic retinoid therapy because of its minor side effects.	0.8154447085800999
Wound instillation seems to be an easy and preferable way to achieve postoperative analgesia in pediatric hernioplasty.	1.0826202358548374
This prospective, randomized and double-blinded pilot-study was initiated to gain preliminary information in order to define the appropriate concentration of local anaesthetic for efficient posthernioplastic analgesia.	1.0230913953229936
The recommended infusion time for i.v.	0.5753775324682668
prostaglandin E 1 (PGE1) therapy is 2 or 3 h, depending on the dose.	0.9586733565551891
The aim of the present multicentre study was to investigate, for the first time, whether the dose of 60 µg PGE1 is effective and well tolerated with shorter infusion times.	1.285242458240912
A total of 118 patients with intermittent claudication and a pain-free walking distance between 50 and 200 m (3 km/h, 12%) were randomized to receive an i.v.	1.1519905649641575
infusion of 3 ampoules Prostavasin (60 µg PGE1) administered for either 1 or 2 h, once a day for 4 weeks.	0.9945544548613879
Primary variables were pain-free walking distance as well as safety, determined by the frequency of adverse events and the course of blood pressure.	1.042308832587118
The efficacy was comparable in the two groups.	0.5968077830756182
In the 1-h infusion group, the pain-free walking distance increased from 87 to 135 m, and in the 2-h group from 88 to 147 m, while the absolute walking distance increased from 124 to 200 m and from 147 to 238 m, respectively.	1.093153695965923
The differences between the two groups were not significant, although an analysis of subgroups with initial pain-free walking distances of less than 80 m indicated a significant difference in favour of the 2-h PGE1 infusion (increase in walking distance 58 m as compared with 22 m).	1.120585761015679
Course of blood pressure and frequency of adverse events were comparable in the two groups.	0.8603730185116174
Altogether, in intermittent claudication both the 1-h and the 2-h PGE1 infusion show comparably good results in terms of efficacy and safety.	1.149370527749339
Patients with an initial pain-free walking distance of less than 80 m seem to reveal a major benefit after a 2-h PGE1 infusion.	1.003823085352539
The problem in the treatment of deep hyalin cartilage defects is due to the minimal regeneration potential of this specific tissue.	1.0083063526756761
Several attempts were made to solve this difficulties experimentally and clinically.	0.7626216829137203
The proliferative potential of autogenous perichondrium/periost is well-known for decades.	0.9293631220780463

The case report emphasizes the importance of a thorough differential diagnosis.	0.9558585782936108
Fractionated irradiation with X-rays or megavoltage is an important therapeutic option in the palliative treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma.	1.0008894245503
We report on three HIV patients demonstrating bullous cutaneous eruptions in the irradiation field.	1.0412757061881843
Three homosexual men (age 45-60 y) stage of disease CDC 3C, were treated with fractionated soft X-rays with the scheme conventionally used by us (total dose 30 Gy, single doses 3 Gy).	1.0601244671995194
Immediately to three days after completion of treatment large blisters appeared within the irradiation field, resolving after 2-4 weeks, leaving postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.	0.9114858585150729
The cause of this rare reaction to soft X-ray therapy, potentially suggesting an individually altered radiation sensitivity, is so far unknown.	1.2266327808329736
Controlled prospective studies applying different fractionation schemes will be necessary to better elucidate this issue.	0.8330077907745698
Due to the decreased trauma in anterior as well as posterior surgical approaches to the spine, microsurgical techniques have been used more frequently in recent years.	1.0802513614229166
This article describes two new microsurgical techniques to approach the anterior lumbar spine for interbody fusion as part of a posterior-anterior stabilization concept in various diseases like spondylolisthesis, degenerative instability; failed back surgery syndrome, fractures etc.	1.0403379307418676
The lumbar segments L 2-5 are approached through a blunt muscle-splitting retroperitoneal technique.	0.8925028817631387
The antero-lateral circumference of the motion segment is exposed with a frame-type retractor which is anchored in the adjacent vertebral bodies with anchoring screws.	0.8988158013282677
The lumbosacral junction is exposed via a mini-laparotomy using a special soft tissue spreader.	0.7702063869451008
Interbody fusion is described with autogeneous bone grafts.	0.6977668065373567
Preliminary experience with 83 patients treated between 1995 and 1996 show that peri- and postoperative morbidity is low.	1.1841638602119247
Clinical as well as radiological results are comparable to the standard techniques.	0.8630854031192825
Spectrum as well as rate of complications so far do not differ from those described in the literature for non-microsurgical approaches.	1.0837177943766363
The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is the strongest ligament of the human knee joint.	1.1970893057750707
Its origin is at the lateral wall of the medial femoral condyle and the insertion is located in the posterior part of the intercondylar area.	1.177684661669966
The posterior cruciate ligament consists of multiple small fiber bundles.	0.6440245370848483
From a functional point of view, one can differentiate fiber bundles with an anterior origin and fiber bundles with a posterior origin at the femur.	0.9818221869996545
The anterior fibers insert in the anterolateral part of the tibial insertion zone.	0.8196009699840443
These fibers become tense when the knee is flexed.	0.4283439169266591
The posterior fibers insert in the posteromedial part of the tibial insertion and become tense when the knee is extended.	0.8480783081219121
The main part of the posterior cruciate ligament consists of type I collagen positive dense connective tissue.	0.8760433300705999
The longitudinal fibrils of type I collagen are divided into small bundles by thin type III collagen positive fibrils.	0.8262229605232644
In the center of the middle third region, the structure of the tissue varies from the typical structure of a ligament.	1.0188803036235132
In this region, the structure of the tissue resembles fibrocartilage.	1.0286108199409916
Oval-shaped cells surrounded by a metachromatic extracellular matrix lie between the longitudinal collagen fibrils.	0.8114227706179373
The femoral origin and the tibial insertion have the structure of chondral apophyseal enthesis.	0.9412096938912998
Near the anchoring region at the femur and tibia there should be various mechanoreceptors which might have an important function for the kinematics of the knee joint.	0.9675688325468208
The blood supply of the PCL arises from the middle geniculate artery.	0.8355866733989813
The ligament is covered by a synovial fold where the terminal branches of the middle and the inferior geniculate artery form a periligamentous network.	1.0432880272437897
From the synovial sheath, the blood vessels penetrate the ligament in a transverse direction and anastomose with a longitudinally orientated intraligamentous network.	0.912108304903122
The distribution of blood vessels within the PCL is not homogeneous.	0.7174948045860535
We detected three avascular areas within the ligament: Both fibrocartilaginous entheses of the PCL are devoid of blood vessels.	0.859689237605404
A third avascular zone is located in the central zone of fibrocartilage of the middle third region.	0.8825337823993985
Atrial reentrant tachycardias (ART) are a potentially life-threatening complication in survivors of congenital heart disease surgery.	1.0734951411639846
From July 1993 to December 1997, temporary transesophageal pacing was used to convert 29 tachycardia episodes in 19 patients.	0.8750998249194706
At the time of the first tachycardia episode, patients' ages were 1 month to 26 years (mean 9.8 yrs).	1.1985400122448107
Time from operation to onset of first tachycardia episode ranged from 1 day to 19 years.	0.8084912374531544
Onset was within the first 2 weeks postoperatively in 6 patients and occurred later in 13 patients (1 to 19 years after operation).	1.1993341873485088
Postoperative pacemaker implantation had been performed in 2 pts; 17 of 19 pts were receiving antiarrhythmic medication.	1.010397128773127
After placing a quadripolar transesophageal catheter, atrial and ventricular signals were recorded and atrial stimulation performed.	0.8214025485605321
Atrial cycle length of tachycardia ranged from 160-380 ms with 1:1 to 4:1 AV conduction.	0.8780127295139095
Temporary transesophageal pacing was performed following an algorithm starting with 4 extrastimuli (20 ms below atrial cycle length of tachycardia).	0.9232777251579862
Tachycardia terminated in 27 of 29 cases (93%) without complications.	1.0871463154555832
In 3 cases, conversion was achieved by pacing after amiodarone 5 mg/kg i.v.	0.8487551329316355
After tachycardia conversion, sinus- or pacemaker rhythm was present in 20 cases.	1.0057608595558198
In 9 cases atrial fibrillation was recorded; spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm occurred after a maximum of 3 min (7 cases) or persisted and required direct current cardioversion (2 cases).	1.1236608595628141
In conclusion, transesophageal atrial pacing is an effective, relatively noninvasive method for conversion of atrial reentrant tachycardias after operation for congenital heart disease.	1.052187537925593
After elucidating the components and theory of neuroticism (N) as well as of psychosomatic complaints and their relationships to personality dimensions and to psychosomatic diseases, comparisons are performed between patients suffering from fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) or related pain diseases with healthy subjects scoring high on personality dimensions related to neuroticism.	1.0344045407101667
FMS and pain patients score high on depression, anxiety, and experience of stress although questionnaire scores on depression are higher in subjects not exhibiting somatic features of the disease.	0.9474004290553144
High subjective pain sensitivity and low thresholds for pain perception are also common features in high N subjects and FMS patients.	0.9314141367003416
On the endocrinological level cortisol responses to challenge tests with CRH as well as prolactin responses to TRH are higher in FMS patients than in high N healthy subjects indicating an endocrinological difference.	0.8761062301057126
A common feature, however, is the lack of adapatability in the two groups, since neurotics are in particular characterized by a low capacity to shift their behavior from one state to the other (waking-sleeping, working-relaxing), to re-adapt to baseline levels after endocrinological or physiological stress responses, or to adjust to conditions of shift work.	1.1863576581034267
This is reflected by chronobiological disturbances in FMS patients and could also explain their maintainance of pain perception, because they are incapable of correcting conditioned pain-producing muscle tension.	0.9114816206988728
Purpose: To document our experience with spiral hydro-CT of the pancreas based on a combination of pharmacologic intestinal paralysis and water distension of the stomach and duodenum with specific reference to tumor detection rate, differentiation of malignant versus benign tumors and assessment of tumor resectability in a prospective study on 211 consecutive patients.	1.1102243879563602
Since the publication of a case of Syphilis transmission by blood transfusion in 1915 the discussion about transfusion-associated bacterial infection is ongoing.	1.0404723249080463
For some time, virus infections through blood and blood products have been highlighted.	0.8407620171978686
However, in the last years the attention required has been drawn to the problem of transmission of bacteria.	1.2969042703375084
In this publication the present situation concerning the contamination rates through blood components and the frequency of transfusion-associated microbial infections is outlined.	0.8735392654927985
The bacteria involved are discussed.	0.5408211012135026
Furthermore, the state of the art for prevention and diagnosis as well as the methods for inactivation of bacteria are assessed.	1.1901672064562396
While working to develop a distal locking device, we analyzed distal nail position with reference to nail deformation and a radiographic-morphometric investigation.	1.065320090685316
The amount and the direction of implant deformation in unslotted stainless steel unreamed tibial nails (Synthes) were analyzed.	0.9012584347489685
Measurement of implant deformation (3 translations, 3 angles) in the center of the distal transverse locking hole was performed with a 3D magnetic motion tracker system before and after nail insertion.	1.2642876977192135
Unreamed tibial nails (diameter 8 mm, n = 10; diameter 9 mm, n = 10) were inserted in paired human cadaver tibiae.	1.0584938291662935
The results showed lateral translations of -4.5+/-3.5 mm (mean and standard deviation, range 14.3 mm) and dorsal translations of -7.8+/-5.8 mm (mean and standard deviation, range 19.2 mm).	1.2947301537133233
Rotational deformations around the longitudinal axis of the nail were 0.3+/-0.7 ° (mean and standard deviation, range 2.4 °).	1.1902606889023515
The results showed, that a simple aiming arm, mounted on the proximal nail end, alone or even in combination with a large working channel (e.g.	1.0482674181612803
10 mm in diameter), was not adequate to the aiming process.	1.281551265605075
A radiographic-morphometric analysis was subsequently performed in 40 tibiae after experimental (n = 20) or clinical (n = 20) implantation of nails 8 mm and 9 mm in diameter.	1.029939822944593
These measurements showed a relatively constant distance between the upper distal transverse hole and the anterior aspect of the tibia (average 12.3 mm and only a narrow range (7.6 mm).	1.150481854381735
These data were the basis for the development of an aiming technique that exploits the relatively constant distance between the distal nail hole and the anterior aspect of the tibia.	0.9877235229670913
The goal of the Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study of Aging (ILSE) is to assess healthy and satisfying aging in middle adulthood and later life.	1.0546069548763557
In addition, this study compares adults from eastern and western Germany.	1.3503482214423048
The data for this study were collected between late 1993 and early 1996 as part of the first measurement point of the ILSE.	1.183538807824605
Five-hundred and one participants from the Leipzig region were compared with 500 participants from the Heidelberg area on four specific dimensions: personality, cognitive functioning, subjective well-being, and health.	1.0531573738567126
Age differences were obtained for neuroticism, extraversion, openness, and agreeableness.	1.0407766474522988
Differences were also obtained in cognitive functioning and health.	0.8232794373806946
Regional differences between eastern and western Germany were obtained in the personality dimensions neuroticism, openness and conscientiousness, as well as in subjective well-being.	1.0208489158319272
Significant age by region interactions were obtained for openness and some of the cognitive measures, as well as for the physicians' health ratings of the participants, suggesting selective historical effects.	1.00407903652837
The results are discussed with respect to functional abilities and levels of satisfaction in midlife, as well as with respect to regional differences that might be due to prior political system differences in the east and west.	0.8869812217494537
Modern obstetrics must try to maintain high safety standards for both mother and child and, at the same time, satisfy the general desire of women for natural birth.	0.8858353922747657
Standards of safety are based on early recognition of high risks, allowing early intervention to prevent serious complications.	1.0083390977427564
A considerable number of diagnostic and therapeutic measures recommended on a prophylactic basis and therefore widely used are responsible for the medical-technical image associated with modern obstetrics.	1.0840726151125686
The benefits of most of these prophylactically recommended activities are unproven or low relative to the unavoidable side effects and the costs associated with widespread application.	1.0158772729922743
There is good scientific proof that routine application of fetal heart rate monitoring during labor and delivery is associated with an increase in the rate of cesarean sections as well as operative vaginal deliveries without any clear benefit to the newborn in terms of a decrease in mortality or morbidity.	0.9930073805635368
In a population of healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies, the prevalence of perinatal mortality or morbidity is so low that even with meta-analysis of several studies the numbers remain too small to show significant differences for these rare events.	1.087765187721976
In high-risk cases the routine application of fetal heart rate monitoring throughout labor and delivery is undisputed and leads to a significant drop in morbiditiy and mortality of the baby.	0.9736544574983554
With careful selection of pregnant women a combination of electronic fetal heart rate monitoring and auscultation during certain segments of the first stage of labor provides adequate surveillance.	0.9695634292182267
We report the history of a 38 year old patient who began to develop mental deterioration at the age of 26.	1.2325709858288272

The "eye-of-the-tiger"-sign, a bilateral hyperintensity in the rostral globus pallidus, was not observed in follow-up examinations.	1.2414238588351338
HSD is a rare autosomal-recessive or sporadic disease of unknown etiology.	0.9736461161098527
In one third of the patients a dementing process is the first clinical sign of the disorder, and is a rare differential diagnosis of early onset dementia.	1.4857192918224569
In 33 patients with chronic venous incompetence (CVI) caused by primary varicoses or postthrombotic syndrome stage I-III (according to Widmer) the therapeutic benefit of 6 months of medically supervised physical exercise training was documented.	1.1279680800491383
During the training penud there was an improvement in subjective complains such as pain and tendency for edema in the legs.	0.8943643072077587

Most frequently, such seizures cause ictal tachycardia, sometimes tachypnea, probably caused by the propagation of epileptic discharges to autonomic cerebral structures.	1.033321913445787
Ictal bradycardia and asystole are rare phenomena.	0.6459528992388682
However, they may be life threatening.	1.5054931466040624
Their differentiation from primary cardiac arrest is possible by the use of ictal EEG and ECG registration.	0.9284087459594716
Postictal serum prolactin measurement does not differentiate syncope from seizure.	0.6418460626125573
However, a postictal increase of creatine kinase is only measured after epileptic seizures and not after syncope.	1.014541533201809
Treatment of such epileptic seizures includes an optimization of anticonvulsant drug therapy and the implantation of a cardiac demand stimulator.	0.9785060692858013
There is growing evidence that ictal asystole is a cofactor in sudden unexplained death in epileptic patients.	0.7913717227353009
A minimal documentation system (MIDOS) has been developed for self-assessment of pain and other symptoms by the patients on palliative care units.	1.142381786520265
To decrease the administrative burden and thereby increase the acceptance of the system an electronic database was developed to facilitate data entry and documentation.	0.9964023807870394
Background: Hearing loss can be found in more than 50% of children with Down syndrome.	1.4255361570382035
Chronic or recurrent middle-ear effusions are considered the most frequent etiology with an incidence of 60%.	1.0578965495608175
Microcystic adnexal carcinoma is a rare semimalignant cutaneous neoplasm characterised by slow but locally aggressive growth.	0.8905777946505954
Its histogenesis and nomenclature are still a subject of controversy.	0.7940328431761258
Under-recognition and the tumour's bland cytologic features lead to frequent misdiagnoses.	0.7319175900956808
In addition, subclinical tumour invasion explains the high incidence of local recurrence.	1.031793817033086
Thus, the tumour makes great demands on the planning of its surgical removal.	1.020440011119906
We report the case of an 81-year-old woman with a microcystic adnexal carcinoma of the lower lip, which was treated by micrographic surgery.	1.2630983430769682
On the basis of this case, differential diagnoses, histogenesis and micrographic surgery as the treatment of choice are discussed.	1.1943524524271287
In old age, individualization processes also simultaneously effect the opportunity and necessity to shape one's life.	0.8313385429503235
Societal orientation dissipates, and the certainties of earlier times disappear.	1.1303658151978115
Plurality and option appear as an increasing twofold challenge to coping with life.	0.757963494776994
These ambiguities characterize modern old age.	0.5246629274379193
Or in other words: the biographization of old age has begun.	0.9792811911737286
Posttraumatic cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is associated with a poor outcome.	0.7369386302129608
When evaluating the literature according to the Utstein method, there were only 2 survivors (0.18%) out of 1,135 CPR attempts after trauma (Table 1).	1.210237576295143
Differences in the study populations and levels of prehospital trauma care led us to analyse the results of a physician-staffed prehospital trauma care system in Cologne.	1.0945219097092378
From January 1987 to December 1990, a total of 49,054 emergency calls were registered using a standardised protocol.	1.0126487908568098
Among 9,595 trauma-related calls, 636 patients were found to be pulseless on arrival of the emergency team, 412 of these were pronounced dead.	0.9601831143720599
CPR was initiated in the remaining 224 patients, who comprise the study population (defined as 100%).	1.0656480116877995
All patients who were admitted to a hospital were followed using a second protocol.	1.1483075643596576
CPR in the field was successful in 68 (30.4%) patients, who were then admitted to a hospital; 42 of these died within the first 24 h. Four patients (1.8%) could be discharged from hospital alive and were still living 1 year later, 1 with a lasting neurological deficit (Fig.	1.2791472521403164
In 156 (69.6%) cases resuscitative attempts were unsuccessful in the field.	1.0680208985793738
Even in a physician-staffed prehospital trauma care system, the chance of surviving a post-traumatic cardiac arrest is minimal.	0.9079379333324559
Survival has to be regarded as an individual fate; the overall results are discouraging.	1.1225919524246049
Even though this study analyses the largest population of posttraumatic CPR ever published, prognostic factors could not be identified due to the few survivors.	0.9914164137004408
Nevertheless, the result does not justify general omission of CPR after trauma as: (1) prognostic factors for survival have not been identified thus far; and (2) no significant additional costs arise from posttraumatic CPR.	1.1275202415111378
Functional voiding disturbances can be due to failure of the detrusor or to discoordinated sphincter function during micturition.	0.7714087271620609
Therapeutical options are directed either to strengthening the contraction up to an adequate magnitude or to lowering the voiding resistance or can be aimed at influencing both.	0.8908022290937462
In a brief survey mechanical, pedagogical, electrotherapeutical, and surgical measures as well as drug treatment are critically examined.	1.1019614004922749
Conservative methods should always be attempted before surgical procedures are performed.	0.8770990095139423
Depending on the degree of severity and the etiology of the disease, a combined therapy can be useful.	1.1667618566659677
In the case of resistance to therapy, intermittent autocatheterism is to be preferred to permanent deviation via an indwelling catheter.	1.0148826312401515
During long-term therapy of hyperuricaemia with allopurinol (300 mg/d) two patients developed generalized granuloma annulare.	1.0561526123972615
The diagnoses were confirmed by histology; concomitant diseases, especially diabetes mellitus, were not detectable.	1.2537823102261147
Following discontinuation of allopurinol therapy, cutaneous granulomas healed without relapse.	0.8236874276669683
Hyperuricaemia could be controlled by low-purine diet and medication avoiding allopurinol.	0.8175898104280181
The clinical history of our two patients suggested a causal connection between allopurinol therapy and generalized granuloma annulare.	0.9218252787992218
For this reason we rate the development of this disease in both cases as a rare but significant side effect of allopurinol.	1.3787044597035991
This should give rise to critical assessment of concomitant drug therapy during development of generalized granuloma annulare.	0.8336176038309467
Background: Aim of the present prospective longitudinal study was the statistical foundation and thus further replication of recent findings of Hasenbring [13], who postulated a significant importance of specific, within the psychological pain research long neglected pain coping strategies as risk factors concerning pain chronification: appeals to "stick it out" on the cognitive level and endurance strategies on the behavioural level.	1.185089229158885
Intraarticular bleeding and muscle bleeding occur spontaneously or as a result of trauma in hemophilia A or B.	0.9482641558154239
The most common sites for hemarthrosis are the knees joints, elbows and ankles joints.	0.9140177960767376
Resorption of intraarticular blood induces reactive hemophilic synovitis.	0.6087119907809976
Hyperplasia of the synovium can be followed by recurrent bleedings.	0.8197800546327386
These early reactions can change to a chronic synovitis and cause cartilage damage, finally resulting in a complete destruction of the joint.	1.0046862261066944
Since 1981 158 adults and 61 children with a hemophilia A or B were treated at the Center for hemophilic disorders Frankfurt in an interdisciplinary approach.	0.9303242630594467
Consequent prophylactic treatment with factor substitution can prevent the incidence of severe hemarthrosis.	0.9862685450525773
Minor joint bleedings are treated by adequate factor substitution, temporarily non-weight bearing of the extremity, application of ice-packs and physical therapy.	1.0139975681318991
More severe joint hemorrhages should be aspirated in order to reduce the acute synovitis.	0.8891660294873679
This is followed by a consequent physical therapy (joint and soft tissue techniques) and anti-inflammatory drugs.	0.9370139307524008
The goal is a sufficient muscular balance of the joint, the improvement of the coordination, and the proprioception.	1.2717524840373666
The chronic synovitis is less painful and poorly responses to conservative interventions.	0.8198837216388489
Local ice application, sytemic and local anti-inflammatory treatment support the physical therapy.	0.8197603545060389
Soft heel shock absorber, elastic and semi-rigid bandages prevent recurrent bleeding episodes by shock absorption and decrease of synovial impingement.	0.8040342148065833
Synovectomy is indicated in cases of chronic persistent synovitis.	0.836569097828422
Radiosynoviorthesis (RSO), which is an alternative in certain cases, has been performed with great success in 12 cases in our hospital.	1.3188744369581358
In advanced arthropathy joint mobilization should be the emphasis of the physical therapy.	0.8622819887803266
Bandages, crutches and ortopaedic shoe devices improve the walking capacity.	0.6878382121850475
Over an 18-month period findings of stress X-ray of the ankle and medical records of 112 cases were analyzed retrospectively as to indications, results and therapeutic consequences.	1.1193414805467385
The analysis showed that critical setting of indications can reduce the frequency of stress X-ray of the ankle and thus lower the total costs.	1.0108190207582761
The introduction of guidelines could be advantageous at medical training institutions.	0.7499519164973184
A 72-year-old patient received 0.1 mg morphine by the intrathecal route and 2x1.5 mg midazolam as adjuvant therapy.	1.1315505545056745
Severe respiratory depression and somnolence supervened 3.5 h later, which lasted over the next 24 h and necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation.	1.146212848991698
Continuous administration of >6 mg naloxone to antagonize the supposed effect of the morphine had no effect.	0.8977222909448767
The patient's condition was not normalized until a single dose of 0.3 mg flumazenil was administered.	1.214771871285684
For the time being, especially in the case of elderly patients, we recommend that strict indications are adhered to when intrathecal administration of morphine is considered and that less than 0.1 mg morphine is given.	1.1875499161314522
Respiration should be monitored for quite some time.	0.7943275292352593
In contrast to the often debated NYHA classification, the determination of peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2) by cardiopulmonary exercise testing allows an objective assessment of the exercise capacity of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF).	1.0638854696035696
However, cardiopulmonary exercise testing is a time consuming and costly diagnostic tool, which requires sophisticated equipment and specially trained personell.	1.291105778429057
Exercise capacity can also be determined by the 6 minute walk test.	0.8026906003244684
This test simply measures the distance covered by strong walking on a hallway level within 6 minutes.	0.8101165432867967
The 6 minute walk test is a submaximal exercise test, which is associated with much smaller increments in heart rate, blood pressure and plasma catecholamines than cardiopulmonary exercise testing.	1.0591370590584976
It is characterized by a very small intraindividual variance.	0.7943951132707784
Furthermore, it can be easily performed and, due to low logistic and personal requirements, it is very cost effective.	1.2497283418794227
The results of the 6 minute walk test - as well as of cardiopulmonary exercise testing - are influenced by extracardial exercise-limiting disorders, such as pulmonary diseases.	1.155042317120517
Independent from the etiology of CHF, the results of the 6 minute walk test are closely related to peak VO2.	1.0433206702471869
In serial exercise testing the distance covered within 6 minutes allow to predict the individual peak VO2.	0.9040123409627986
Like peak VO2 the 6 minute walk test has been shown to be a predictor of morbidity and mortality in CHF, with its predictive value being independent from left ventricular ejection fraction and other potential prognostic parameters.	1.1540205847010492
In CHF patients a walking distance < 300 m is associated with a one-year-mortality of up to 50%, whereas the one-year-mortality in patients reaching a walking distance > 450 m amounts to only a few percent.	1.2694443659266785
In addition, the hospitalization rate of patients reaching a walking distance of < 300 m is several fold higher than in those with a walking distance >= 450 m. Like cardiopulmonary exercise testing, the 6 minute walk test allows to control the efficiency of specific treatments and to monitor the natural course of the disease.	1.1384024463199989
The 6 minute walk test is, thus, a cost effective alternative to cardiopulmonary exercise testing in CHF patients.	1.0010364162109304
However, neither the 6 minute walk test alone nor the results of cardiopulmonary exercise testing alone are sufficient for selecting patients, e.g., for cardiac transplantation, as each individual case requires a synopsis of all relevant facts and parameters.	1.223437422454675
We report the first case of prurigo pigmentosa in the German literature.	1.106102166832207
For over a year, a 16-year old white girl developed an immensely pruritic symmetrical reticular, papulo-vesicular eruption on the trunk, axillae and pubic region.	0.9386077438304332
Histologically a superficial  perivascular spongiotic and lichenoid  inflammatory pattern with prominent pigmentary incontinence in older lesions was observed.	0.8536266336228366
Topical corticosteroids and  systemic antihistamines had no effect.	0.722402912129495
Systemic corticosteroids and diaminophenylsulphone (DADPS) produced improvement but could not prevent recurrences.	0.8182144191523403
Healing  occurred only after 4 weeks of systemic- minocycline.	0.9729436302660368
Following parenteral administration, clonidine has analgesic effects at both cerebral and spinal levels.	0.8259262764185212
Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) makes it possible to determine equipotent dosages of analgesics by relating analgesic consumption per time to the levels of analgesia obtained in comparable patient populations.	0.8837694121033344
Therefore, we studied the equipotency ratios of clonidine and piritramide and the incidence of undesired side effects in the treatment of postoperative pain in patients undergoing maxillo-facial surgery.	1.1971320916338677
The effects of glycerol are discussed in detail.	0.6464333795965561
Glycerol can lead to a transition of crystalline lipid structures within the horny layer lipids into liquid crystalline states.	0.8260870521591661
Especially if applied in oil/water-emulsions it improves, the hydration of the horny layers better than urea.	0.9812856039405241
In addition, if facilitates the dissolution of desmosomes within the superior layers of the horny layer enhancing desquamation.	1.0437255337534082
Furthermore, by using glycerol, the mechanical properties of the skin can be influenced; long term used leads to increased elasticity.	1.3689276349981432
The roughness of the horny layer is reduced, which can be explained by the abrasive and/or the hydrating effect.	0.9614213914292854
Glycerol used in o/w-emulsions also protects against the influence of tensides or noxious lipophilic agents.	0.8051683232996071
Presumably a flux from the base of the epidermis towards its surface triggers the regeneration of the barrier.	0.9447807112910573
Finally,  glycerol can lead - similarly to urea - to an improvement in active agent penetration, as has been proven for hexylnicotinate.	1.473651542801978
Background: An 18-year-old woman presented with thyrotoxic symptoms - right sided lid retraction and exophthalmus.	1.2439164858265215
She complained of diplopia on lateral gaze.	0.5568532584900125
Laboratory investigations confirmed Grave's disease with hyperthyroidism and TSH receptor antibodies.	0.7060284630895163
Atrial tachyarrhythmias significantly reduce quality of life in a surprisingly large number of patients.	1.0886807536528242
The safe and effective treatment of atrial tachyarrhythmias is being intensively studied.	1.1180024305938538
Internal electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation has been shown to be an effective non-pharmacological treatment option.	1.1409384581330422
Cardioversion therapy has been applied in the absence of a clear understanding of the mechanisms governing the process.	0.9779082442994551
Recent measurements of atrial transmembrane potentials using sophisticated optical mapping techniques reveal that internal cardioversion shocks cause changes in repolarization time that favor annihilation of wave fronts.	0.7984721663782126
Thus, mechanisms of atrial cardioversion appear to be similar to ventricular defibrillation.	1.0769371979986084
Further studies are needed to determine whether cardioversion mechanisms differ for chronic atrial fibrillation compared to acute atrial fibrillation.	0.8857406805207841
Plasmocytic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is the most common tumor of bone and bone marrow, typically diagnosed by symptoms such as monoclonal paraproteinemia, proteinuria, anemia and hypercalcemia.	1.085813064311737
In its progress, deposits of amyloids in  almost all organs can be observed.	0.8297008326444735
However, plasmacytomas which are diagnosed by macroglossia of primarily unknown etiology are rare.	1.133693959747121
This case report presents a 61-year-old woman who suffered from a persistent swelling of the tongue with painful ulcerations.	1.1086365861443055
A biopsy led to the diagnosis of primary systemic amyloidosis of the light-chain type, which subsequently proved to be a plasmacytoma with lambda light-chains stage II after Durie and Salmon.	1.1003631196346833
In the course of the disease the patient developed further deposits of amyloids in the whole gastro-enteric system.	1.105361546951681
Macroglossia as a primary manifestation of plasmacytoma is rarely described in medical literature.	0.9463064530816351
However, reports on deposits of amyloid in the tongue in advanced stages of disease are well known.	1.200675174196436
Aim: Improved detection of pulmonary-venous pathologies by imaging the pulmonary veins without arterial overlay.	1.0498490448258408
For the histological verification of suspicious non-palpable small breast tumors, the three-dimensional breast biopsy applied as cylindrical extirpation using the ABBI system is the optimal solution at present.	0.9723939042822124
Because of the possibility of performing mammography during the operation, errors of localization can be corrected and incorrect incisions avoided.	0.857495655948591
Taking the three radiomorphologically leading symptoms into consideration - suspicious microcalcification, focal shadow and structural irregularity - it can be stated that the digital mammography of the ABBI system is more sensitive than the conventional one for detecting microcalcification, but focal shadow and structural irregularity are detected less well by digital technique.	1.0919416550554213
These structures should be preoperatively marked by using sonography.	0.7541097289235686
After the complete removal of suspicious microcalcification checked by digital mammography during the operation, residual tumor might be found in a second excision when histologically invasive or intraductal tumor terminations reach the excision margin (R1 resection).	0.9527032200062225
Thirteen invasive and 8 intraductal carcinomas were found in 80 cases of cylindrical extirpation using the ABBI system.	0.8027771758561182
In 7 procedures carried out to exclude an in-breast recurrence, 3 intraductal carcinomas and 1 invasive carcinoma were observed.	1.0587652721753027
In 8 of 12 invasive carcinomas and in 1 of 5 intraductal carcinomas, breast-conserving therapy was indicated.	1.0385445341545188
Two cases of invasive carcinoma fulfilled the criteria applied (minimal tumor-free margin > 2 mm, no extensive intraductal component) to use the ABBI cylinder as lumpectomy without a second excision to follow.	1.2182402977576519
With the increasing number of patients surviving after therapeutic intervention for congenital heart disease (CHD), accurate and frequent follow-up of their morphologic and functional cardiovascular status is required, preferably with a noninvasive imaging technique.	1.2267698539217669
In a retrospecitve multicenter study we followed-up 30 fractures of the neck of the femur in children aged 11 years (1.5-15 years) for 4.8 years (0.5-20.0 years).	1.3124348213014907
It is the aim of this study to analyse factors possibly related to outcome, like age at injury, type of fracture, interval between injury and treatment, method of stabilization and postoperative interval until full weight bearing.	1.1517553174442487
At follow-up subjective parameters (pain, weather sensitiveness), clinical parameters (range of motion, claudication, leg length discrepancies) and radiological parameters (hip series) were investigated and medical charts and roentgenograms were reviewed using a standardized protocol.	1.2179618240038368
29 of 30 children (96.7 %) have sustained displaced fractures.	1.1408257156714583
Non-operative treatment has been applied in 4 children.	1.0061033925692267
26 femoral neck fractures (type I: 1, type II: 8, type III: 17) were stabilized by internal fixation using screws and/or pins.	1.2032866358005172
Following non-operative treatment one child suffered a coxa vara and another child suffered a avascular femoral head necrosis in combination with coxa vara and leg length shortening of 4 cm.	0.9760997949331285
Following operative treatment 9 of 26 children (34.6 %) sufferred a avascular femoral head necrosis and 3 children (11.5 %) suffered a coxa vara.	1.1180480306604987
In 6 of 26 children (23 %) we observed leg length discrepancies > 2 cm.	1.1643574495815403
We were not able to demonstrate any significant follow-up result differencies between the groups of children who have sustained type II or type III fractures, or between the groups of children aged < 10 years when compared to children aged > 10 years, or between the group of children who were operated on within 6 hours after the accident when compared to the group of children operated > 6 hours after the accident.	1.160638082205968
We observed no significant follow-up result differences between the groups of children who had different intervals between operation and full weight bearing.	0.9037920929929771
Operative fracture management remains the treatment of choice in the majority of displaced femoral neck fractures in children.	1.090803518414409
However, in our limited study we were not able to demonstrate any significant follow-up result differences between the group of children treated by immediate open reduction and internal fixation (interval injury - operation < 6 hours) when compared to children who had been operated > 6 hours after the injury.	1.1817956475942437
Evidence based standards for structure quality in out-patient management of chronic pain states do not exist.	0.9301456022308568
Therefore we tried to evaluate if german standards for outpatient management of chronic pain states which are based on opinions of experts for pain management influence the outcome quality of independent physicians for treatment of chronic low back pain.	1.039959856014803
Objective: The aim of this study was to compare low dose dopamine and dopexamine with respect to of liver-venous oxygen saturation, oxygen delivery and - demand, liver function tests and cardiocirculatory effects  in the reperfusion period during a hemihepatectomy operation with occlusion of the liver hilus.	1.177038824964029
Facial trauma is frequent and mainly caused by motor vehicle accidents.	0.7054700476808371
Due to this main etiologic factor, trauma to the facial skeleton is often associated with serious injuries, commonly involving the brain, chest or abdomen.	0.9194288347180037
As a consequence, the initial clinical management of these patients includes control of hemorrhage and immediate assessment of life-threatening injuries, including the maintenance of the airways.	1.2647041446463294
Patients presenting with facial trauma are initially evaluated with a systematic clinical examination because many fractures can be accurately diagnosed by inspection and palpation alone.	0.8915585842934708
In these cases plain film radiographs serve only for confirmation and documentation of the diagnosis.	0.9977643283563126
In many other cases accompanying and extensive soft tissue swelling may clinically obscure fractures.	0.8237074855463575
A complete and accurate evaluation of these patients requires additional radiological imaging methods.	0.943965974870582
A series of plain films may be generally sufficient but in most of the cases they can be regarded as initial screening methods for more thorough diagnosis with computed tomography (CT).	0.9912873395249682
In trauma patients CT is the imaging method of choice because it shows more fracture lines and displaced fragments than any other imaging modality.	0.9966431595328862
CT delineates soft tissue and bony structures and can localize and even characterize foreign bodies.	0.8495444623814014
A complete and accurate characterization of the fracture type and potentially associated complications is mandatory for the appropriate treatment and can only be achieved by careful radiological (CT) evaluation.	1.120678555232531
On the basis of the claims data of the statutory health insurance funds, surgery rates and small-area variations within the catchment area of the AOK Magdeburg were examined for the year 1997.	1.0676724086606473
Substantial variation can be constantly seen.	0.5857121902312546
The extremal quotient at the 30 most frequent ICPM groups ranged from 2 to 5.	0.7918597910102785
Generally, the extent of the variation was larger with elective procedures than with acute.	1.0328514059661247
Correlation analyses do not show clear associations with hospital bed supply and physician density in primary sectors.	0.8257714754712715
The extent of the small-area variation requires further research to evaluate possible determinants of surgery rates.	1.1278218746556736
Criteria for hospital admission and indications for surgery should be made explicit.	0.9886540537747496
Between 1984 and 1994 the legally required task force "Advisory Committee to the German Federal Health Office in Matters of Approval and Review of Existing Medicines B3-Psychiatry, Neurology, Anesthesiology" analyzed and evaluated the CNS-active compounds that until then had only possessed a fictitious registration.	0.9172440965481272
The evaluation was related to efficacy and safety within the indications claimed by the producers.	0.8317593853286752
Reviews and monographies had to be established for 445 basic compounds.	0.8851452378334222
One hundred positive and 30 negative monographies were published.	0.7099777189845881
"Negative" indicates that none of the claimed indications could be accepted by the committee.	0.9011062249993365
It is regrettable that the Federal Health Agency did not notice a considerable part of these negative evaluations until the present date.	0.8674184285954084
The process of the "Aufbereitung" was stopped abruptly by the 5th amendment of the German Drug Law in August 1994, - a very doubtful political decision with respect to drug safety in this country.	1.1382358854186707
Background: We attempted to illustrate connections between selected metabolic parameters and the inflammation course in patients after cataract operations.	1.1522316908158763
Without a more detailed knowledge of etiology and pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis final conclusions regarding an association between physical trauma and the onset or course of multiple sclerosis cannot be drawn.	1.0124938861098425
Only a few prospective studies which are appropriately designed to prove a putative correlation have been published.	0.9012954045238263
A critical review of these studies and some case reports, in the light of the current pathophysiological concepts of multiple sclerosis, does not indicate a causal relationship between physical trauma and onset of multiple sclerosis or exacerbations.	1.1680796892130092
We report on unusual presentation forms of Pneumocystis carinii infection of the lung in two patients with AIDS.	1.2262533688857393
A 36-years-old woman presented a cavitation in the lung middle lobe and bullous changes in the apical portion of the right upper lobe on the chest x-ray.	1.0874730925688885
The biopsy of these lesions was not diagnostic and the patient was operated on.	1.1387555249569326
The surgical specimen of the removed lung segment showed a cavitary lesion with a border of granulation tissue with giant cells, focal recent and older hemorrhages, rests of fibrinous exudate and dystrophic calcifications.	0.8334986832764164
In the surrounding tissue there were Pneumocystis carinii in the alveolar spaces and also in the alveolar walls, this tissue invasion through the organisms being most probably the cause of the cavitary change.	1.1103497223628112
A cytomegalic virus infection was also found.	0.766433845868599
In aortic atresia, coronary perfusion normally occurs through retrograde blood flow in the ascending aorta.	0.8260768806408679
We report on two patients with antegrade flow in the ascending aorta despite aortic atresia.	0.7123797437635961
In one patient with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (aortic atresia, severe mitral stenosis), an intact interatrial septum/premature closure of the foramen ovale was found.	1.0960570039789488
While no other way of left atrial or ventricular decompression was found, echocardiography, angiography and the post-mortem examination showed left ventricular to coronary sinusoids as the sole pathway for systemic oxygenation.	0.9969282456573051
In a second patient with complex congenital heart disease, including aortic atresia, antegrade flow in the ascending aorta was through a left coronary fistula with shunt flow originating from the pulmonary trunc.	1.0052323773436007
This report describes systemic perfusion depending on retrograde coronary flow due to coronary-cameral (sinusoids) and coronary arterio-venous fistulas leading to the phenomenon of antegrade blood flow in the ascending aorta despite aortic atresia.	0.9674187075142031
The introduction of biosensor technology for near bedside measurement of plasma lactate concentrations has been a promising step for critical care profiling.	0.9296252131621416
However, methodological drawbacks and relevant inaccuracy have been reported.	1.1017408068074077
With the advent of a new biosensor (Chiron Diagnostics) and a revised NOVA Biomedical device, accuracy was expected to be improved.	1.066740397202724
The goal of the present investigation was to evaluate the accuracy of both methods.	1.0184644805832475
The combined histological and microcomputed analysis of human iliac crest biopsies leads to major advances in our understanding of three-dimensional bone architecture.	0.8266698626112401
Microcomputed tomography avoids the time-consuming reconstruction and artifacts of serial sections.	0.8273285964954339
Furthermore, its high resolution allows the recording of structural differences as low as 10 mm.	1.2060984163499284
Thus, three-dimensional analysis in combination with histological evaluation of cellular dynamics facilitates earlier and easier recording of changes of cancellous bone.	1.0703080533654694
The aneurysmal bone cyst represents a tumorlike lesion, which does not occur frequently.	0.8953444404137206
Every site of the skeleton may be involved.	0.9320786130267796
Although it can be observed at any age, it distinctly predominates from 10 to 20 years of age.	1.1529635665578066
Distinction of aneurysmatic bone cysts from certain benign or malignant bone tumours requires subtle imaging techniques and an experienced bone tumour pathologist.	0.8571287395734398
Since the lesion shows a heterogeneous biological behaviour and typically occurs in the growing skeleton, a wide range of surgical procedures must be provided concerning tumour resection and defect reconstruction.	1.0912997748392659
In the current retrospective study results of 41 surgically treated aneurysmal bone cysts, thereof 5 latent, 31 active, and 5 aggressive lesions, were investigated.	1.1565831344251132
While morbidity due to the therapeutic measures was comparatively low even in extended lesions and demanding reconstructions, a recurrence rate of 19.5% had to be observed in our series.	1.1436436547419924
Taking into consideration the biological activity of the lesion, analysis of the recurrences revealed inappropriate surgical margins had been chosen at the primary operation in all of these patients.	1.0769684461661688
Since the risk of a local relapse is linked both to aggressiveness of the primary lesion and to surgical radicality, therapy of aneurysmal bone cyst requires preoperative staging and stage-dependent surgical procedures.	1.140634757620076
The RS3PE syndrome (Remitting Seronegative Symmetrical Synovitis with Pitting Edema) is a manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis in the elderly with a good prognosis.	1.0115331996229187
It usually presents as an acute, symmetric polysynovitis with edema of the dorsum of the hands and feet.	0.6322475842336179
Anti-inflammatory treatment with corticosteroids leads to prompt improvement.	0.8396730086675046
We describe the case of an 81 year old man with a primarily unilateral manifestation involving the right hand.	1.103136192128175
A thrombosis of the axillary vein was suspected.	0.7424424366193838
Within a few days he developed a pitting edema of the dorsum of the other hand.	1.0238285421283257
Movement of both shoulders and wrists was painful.	0.7529035069872614
Low-dose corticosteroid therapy resulted in a rapid improvement of the edema and the inflammatory symptoms.	1.0308704056851077
The objective of this study was to determine the usefulness, safety and acceptance of a new technique of percutaneous implantation of port-catheter-systems (PIPS) for locoregional intraarterial chemotherapy of the liver.	1.1096974725906337
From October 1994 to July 1996, 128 patients (30 women, 98 men) participated in an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program (phase II).	1.0103286547395236
Our objectives were to demonstrate risk-factor modification and increased work-load capacity resulting directly from the rehabilitation in terms of primary results and long-term effects, 6 months (n = 59) and 12 months (n = 30) after termination of the program.	1.2429492891176561
We observed how many of the patients were able to be occupationally re-integrated after completion of phase II rehabilitation.	1.0382144550855092
Here, we present the so-called "Vollmer retractor", which can be fixed on to the operating table.	1.2212233772512724
It allows an optimal transference of the traction force on to the border of the wound, both in upper and lower abdominal interventions.	1.065228647343159
In this way, as shown by our recent experience, we gain an optimal view of the subdiaphragmatic area and into the small pelvis.	1.1835468699629845
The disaster management in Germany is embodied in the constitution.	0.9037937672637504
According to the German constitution the ministries of the interior of the federal states coordinate the disaster management by delegating it to the city and county administrations.	0.9503353413684555
These elaborate and update a special disaster management calendar, which allows a prompt flow of information to and from the administration and the person in charge of operations and guarantees a smooth collaboration on which the success of the operation depends.	1.1407336383369169
The American-European Consensus Conference recently recommended the following criteria for diagnosis of ARDS: (1) acute onset; (2) PaO2/FiO2<=200 mmHg regardless of PEEP level; (3) bilateral infiltrates seen on frontal chest radiograph; (4) PCWP <= 18 mmHg when measured or no clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension.	1.0298557728969395
Pathophysiologically, ARDS is characterized by pulmonary edema owing to injury of the capillary-alveolar membranes and increased pulmonary artery pressure.	0.9661436537506588
It is further distinguished by severe hypoxemia unresponsive to the usual methods of support for respiratory failure.	0.8768849147903522
Hypoxemia is caused by intrapulmonary right-to-left shunting due to to persistent perfusion of non-ventilated alveoli.	0.8055280508705188
Another characteristic feature in ARDS is the low thoracopulmonary compliance.	0.8930966534849859
Latest studies suggest that the incidence of the syndrome is in the range of 3-10 cases / 100,000 inhabitants / year.	1.2554526171220282
Mortality rates are a major concern: old and new reports continue to report mortality rates of 50-60%.	0.9092005619883703
Thoracic organ transplantation has evolved as standard therapy in end-stage cardiac and pulmonary failure.	0.9156429388622361
Meanwhile more than 50.000 heart, 2500 heart-lung and 10.000 lung transplantations have been performed worldwide.	1.088422130030399
Improvements in patient selection as well as in the postoperative management have led to 1-year survival rates of 70-90%.	1.1446480441857991
Long-term results are still influenced by the development of graft vessels disease, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and malignancies.	1.0708066618841037
Furthermore, indications and results of different procecures will be presented and new developments discussed.	1.2282174131272097
The paper focuses on the cultural history of brain death in Germany in the second half of the 20th century.	0.9674615799475615
It analyzes scientific and public discourses on the relevance of brain death and the importance of medical innovations in intensive care medicine.	0.8063509729008614
The paper examines how the public reacted when heart transplantation led to an urgent need for a new definition of death.	0.9729930903514167
It will be shown how the concept of brain death was accepted by the public, introduced into clinical routine, and implemented through medical and legal policies.	1.0246441122475527
Finally, it will be analyzed why the public consensus on brain death was definitely questioned in the last ten years.	1.210468333789818
An understanding of the use of the concept of brain death by scientists, lawyers, theologians, and the public during the last three decades may help to shed light on the social role of science in modern and late-modern societies.	1.1235226838317327
Background: In the course of Graves' disease (GD) the extraocular muscles become fibrotic after an acute inflammatory stage.	1.130619738804779
Differentiation of these two stages is important for therapy.	1.1257585199027393
Injuries of the joints of the pelvis and of the acetabulum are still a problem even today.	1.252090761775988
When the joints of the pelvis are damaged the risk of complicated pelvic injuries, that is to say pelvic injuries with damage to the soft tissues in and around the pelvis, is increased threefold.	1.0636910162825224
The lethality, the overall gravity of the injuries, the probability of haemorrhagic complications and the proportion of associated pelvic injuries are also increased.	1.1120803070194403
Even when anatomical reconstruction of the lower limb girdle is achieved, long-term secondary conditions such as pain and genitourinary and neurological scquelae frequently persist.	0.9715706703190868
Complicated pelvic injuries, i. e. pelvic injury with concomitant damage to organs and soft tissues in the pelvis and pelvic injuries with ipsilateral femoral fracture (floating hip) are special cases.	1.005655907270778
Haemodynamic stabilization of the patient and the treatment of organic lesions must be the first priorities in the interdisciplinary therapy.	1.2108671015144334
Even when these priorities are correctly observed, the lethality is almost three times as high as in the case of pelvic injuries not involving soft-tissue damage.	1.0896971115496674
Acetabular fractures are a particular challenge even compared with other joint fractures.	0.8809641049594179
Operative treatment with anatomical joint reconstruction and stable internal fixation has been shown to have the best results.	1.0879439660369463
In addition to the type of fracture and the personal experience of the surgeon concerned, such fracture-specific factors as the presence of further fractures of the posterior wall, comminuted fractures, joint depression fractures and intra-articular fragments increasingly play a part.	1.207340886254774
The long-term result worsens with increasing number of these additional pathologies.	1.1821885065484792
The primary cartilaginous damage caused by the accident seems to have a considerable influence on the long-term result following acetabular fractures.	1.0698249994609714
Two-dimensional conventional X-rays and computer tomographic imaging systems contribute to the diagnosis and surgical planning of patients with orofacial malformations.	1.2108025368409694
The ability to reformat CT scans into three-dimensional osseous and soft tissue surface images has a significant impact on the diagnosis and management of orofacial malformations.	0.9830135831617313
Cephalometric evaluation with teleradiography provides precise insight into both the skeletal structures and the soft parts, enabling the radiologist to assess the relationship among the different parts in a given subject, at any given time and in relation to the normal.	1.0809594488363925
The purpose of this study was to check the precision of the Dräger vaporizer model 19.3 when filled with three different preparations of isoflurane.	0.9500472353385665
Background: Since there is no epidemiologic assessment of the frequency of pain caused by tumor in Germany, tumor-pain-prevalence is estimated indirectly on the basis of mortality and median survival.	1.2348458349924054
Knowing that about 50% of all patients having metastases or incurable locoregional recurrence suffer from pain every day, the product of median survival times mortality was calculated to achieve the number of patients' days with tumor-caused pain per year (82.710.690 days in Germany 1995).	1.0873686986319497
By division with 365 (days), it is calculated that 226.605 patients require tumor pain related treatment at one day in Germany.	1.092054857377975
Another calculation based on Bonica's publications that 60-90% of patients suffering from advanced cancer are having pain and based on an estimated tumor prevalence 1989/90 revealed a tumor pain prevalence of 221.826.	0.9747303327010781
Laser catheters which run eccentrically on a guide wire were developed for maximization of luminal gain by excimer laser angioplasty (ELCA).	0.8068918266906349
We investigated the safety and efficacy of ELCA with these new catheters plus PTCA in patients with restenoses or occlusions in coronary stents.	0.9235266571683524
The age of standardized instrumented scoliosis correction and stabilization began with Harrington instrumentation (HI).	0.8126726822147571
With HI, satisfactory long-term correction of the frontal plane averaged approximately 50 %, but without notable derotational capabilities.The distraction of the concavity leads to reduction of the sagittal contour of the spine (flat back), which is biomechanically disadvantageous.	1.2530754052525632
The newer multisegmentally attached implant systems avoid this disadvantage.	0.629773567661767
The first prototypes of these systems were Luque- (SSI) and Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation.	1.1893294528732063
Ideal indications for posterior instrumented curve correction are structural idiopathic double major curves and flexible single curves.	0.7832376225864679
However, even with these newer doublerod systems derotation is low, because derotation is, without any doubt, related to anterior release and thus decoupling of the segments by means of disc resection.	1.1935554872841199
Autoaggressive syndromes as causes of diseases underlying chronic blepharitis and keratoconjunctivitis that are refractory to treatment are often difficult to recognize.	0.8901627071960602
The surgical correction of a tandem stenosis of the carotid artery is sometimes difficult, especially if the second stenosis is near or above the skull base.	1.0241400539086774
Angioplasty and Stent implantation may offer an alternative to standard surgical procedures in the treatment of carotid stenoses in the future.	1.0638321568573412
However, the potential advantages of these endovascular techniques warrant continued evaluation.	1.1919470866890247
The application of these techniques in carotid artery tandem stenoses presents specific problems and dangers.	0.9828331759094782
We discuss the case of a 78-year-old man with severe carotid stenoses on both sides and an additional symptomatic tandem stenosis above the skull base on the right side.	1.0240436606344685
After the surgical correction of the left carotid artery using standard endarterectomy, we performed endarterectomy on the right side in combination with an open Stent implantation.	1.3001351516130795
The periungual fibromas in tuberous sclerosis are also known as Koenen tumors.	0.7222706844565288
Joannes Henricus Maria Koenen was born on March 10, 1893, in Eindhoven and died in Bois-le-Duc May 29, 1956.	0.9022641508256191
From 1910 to 1918 he studied medicine at the University of Amsterdam.	0.751663163773372
Then he worked as a physician at the "Coudewater" asylum in Rosmalen and from 1929 in the "Voorburg" asylum in Vught.	0.8871023462120736
In 1932 he published his publication concerning a family with tuberous sclerosis in which photographs of periungual fibromas are shown.	0.7596417762801556
His thesis in 1933 at the University in Leiden was titled "Imbecility in children.	0.8508004975592547
Its Importance in pedagogic and social regard, by reason of an investigation in some communities in Noord-Brabant".	0.9815206932140823
Later he was appointed director of a state mental institution.	0.7265006563087102
The periungual fibromas in tuberous sclerosis were first described by Richad Kothe in Munich in 1903.	0.7002734985465854
Parallel with the increasing number of coronary stent implantation procedures, new or more elaborate coronary stents were introduced into clinical use almost every month in 1996.	1.038616260527075
We have studied the architecture, surface-morphology, and shape-conversion of 16 different coronary stent systems.	1.020020609473178
The objective of our study was to detect possible specific design and surface features which might influence the healing process, instent restenosis, and stent thrombosis.	1.0435271803068176
Using electron microscopy we found ultrasmooth surfaces on 5 stents.	0.695794742279192
All other coronary stents revealed individually varying and partly sharp-edged surface irregularities.	0.753711323675578
Video-based morphometry showed covering between 8.3% and 26.4%.	1.0803498445999082
Stent shortening after in-vitro expansion ranged from 0% up to 10.5% of the initial stent length.	1.2875116394761963
In some stent systems balloon dilation lead to over-expansion of the stent margaine.	0.8360285389781218
This over-expansion mounted up to 20% of the balloon diameter and the stents revealed a rather biconcave than homogenous expansion pattern.	1.0274796287977155
This phenomenon was also found after postmortal stent implantation in 20 autopsied hearts.	0.9678187302616331
Unilateral hearing loss (HL) caused by an acoustic neuroma (AN) is regarded to be neural ("non-cochlear").	1.1068952768986682
By using otoacoustic emissions it is possible to prove concurrent sensory (cochlear) HL.	0.9184342740812919
We prefer distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) because these are more frequency-specific and stable.	0.8277995068921752
From April 1994 to May 1996, we examined preoperatively 24 patients with radiologically proven AN.	1.1501581593606593
Pure-tone audiometry, DP-grams, brainstem-evoked response audiometry (BERA) and vestibular studies were performed in all cases, while special auditory tests (Fowler, Carhart) and short increment sensitivity indices were also performed in 12 cases.	1.0702494333984887
BERA was pathological in 23 cases and latencies were borderline in one case.	0.9146939789015367
After comparing audiograms and DP-grams we found 13 patients with sensory HL, 4 patients with combined sensorineural HL and 7 patients with neural HL.	1.0521094135767348
There was a strong correlation between the results of DPOAE and the results of special auditory test (=0.63) whereas there was no correlation between tumor size and cochlear function.	1.155935592545633
The result showed that the typical HL caused by AN was a combined sensorineural loss.	1.0521020549589701
DPOAE were not suited for the detection of AN but were able to give exact information about any remaining cochlear function.	0.909707836203117
The monoclonal dominant malignant T cells in mycosis fungoides (MF) carry identical TCR rearrangements.	0.8094347512796641
Their detection is a useful diagnostic tool.	0.8378480028386059
Thus, in routine diagnosis we investigated the occurrence of monoclonal T cells in skin biopsy samples of MF-patients by TCR-PCR, followed by temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE).	1.1210597690377146
In 188 out of 208 MF patients, at least one skin sample with sufficient DNA quality for PCR analysis was obtained.	0.9895933726007117
Applying a consensus PCR for the TCR genes VI and J 1/2, we detected monoclonal T cells in 122 cases (65%).	0.9262482987435059
In the remaining 66 cases, we performed two multiplex-PCRs, covering rearrangements of the other TCR genes.	1.2383813807871749
Here we found in 11 cases (6%) predominant clonal rearrangements of VII-IV and J 1/2 and in 2 (1%) those of VI-IV and J P1/2.	1.3310205497344116
In patients with MF, detecting rearrangements of only VI and J 1/2 is sufficient for PCR screening analysis.	0.8440256522125169
In 53 of the patients (28%) the applied methods revealed no monoclonal T cells.	1.133967208382722
This may be due to a low cell number, oligoclonal nature, chromosomal abberations or remaining of TCR in germline configuration.	0.8188687562718887
Despite significant improvements in early detection of hearing losses in children, a relatively long interval still exists from initial concern by families to definite audiological identification.	0.9219212020343751
The aim of our retrospective cross-sectional study was to identify parental factors contributing to the delay of early detection.	1.2566027742469428
The parents of 70 hearing-impaired children were interviewed.	0.750499770618653
All children were fitted with hearing aids in our clinical and had no additional physical or cognitive disabilities.	1.0256896756448608
At an average age of 19.5 months, parents or family doctors noticed first signs of a possible hearing impairment.	1.1328957775044313
On average it then took an additional 7.2 months until hearing impairment was diagnosed by an expert and the necessary first steps taken for rehabilitation (fitting of hearing aids).	1.0404565989867265
Significantly, total hearing loss or profound hearing impairments were detected earlier than mild or moderate hearing impairments.	0.8858745760665105
In addition to hearing loss, parental education correlated significantly with an earlier start of rehabilitation.	0.9971715802923197
Statistical analysis revealed that children with hearing-impaired close relatives as well as first-born children tended to be diagnosed later.	1.0293069671296227
To further improve secondary prevention of hearing loss, the competence of specific parental groups should be taken into consideration.	0.9499913957094538
After the incidental puncture of a sidebranch of the thyreocervical trunk during a subclavian vein catheterization, a symptomatic av-fistula developped.	0.8967689721353932
The diagnosis was confirmed by angiography.	0.4610549808106335
Using a microcatheter system the fistula was occluded with microcoils.	0.7527275151686434
This prospective study was designed to compare quality of life, life satisfaction, and subjective ratings of health before and at variable time intervals after heart transplantation (HTx).	1.0204867105868827
175 patients were included between February 1994 and December 1997.	0.9790420217458314
Every six months before and 1,5, 3, 6, and 12 months after HTx, they received the following standardized and validated questionnaires: German SF 36, heart failure and specific transplant symptom list, global quality of life assessment, Munich life quality dimension list, expected/experienced life changes after HTx, good command of the German language, and a minimum age of 18 years.	1.2752165989080113
During data evaluation, median (Me), mean (M), and standard deviation (SD) were created from individual parameters.	1.2822009492288458
Quality of life was rated as very poor by 84% of patients with congestive heart failure.	0.9545365145553657
Only 6 weeks after HTx, 74% rated their quality of life as significantly better.	0.9829112322050279
Before HTx 80% were very unsatisfied about their health status and 87% about physical performance.	0.9002284889334995
Six weeks after HTx, this parameter improved significantly and 76% were very satisfied about their health status and 50% about physical performance.	1.0382444760517933
While somatic changes expected before HTx corresponded well with experienced ones, psychological improvements were smaller than expected, but one year after HTx they were significant (before: M=3.66; SD=0.9; Range (R)=3.78 vs 12 months postop: M=4.61; SD=0.6; R=2.67; p<0.05).	0.9839525217038263
Quality of life correlated before HTx best with subjectively rated health (r=0.61, p<0.01) and 6 months after with satisfaction about health status (r=0.76, p<0.01).	0.9405779058375837
Only in 25% were expected improvements fulfilled regarding sexual activity/satisfaction, professional situation, and recreational activities.	1.1088515538162327
90% of posttransplant patients reported physical compaints, most by effects of immunsuppression, but were coping well.	1.257125563541267
The study shows that already 6 weeks after successful HTx all quality of life parameters improved significantly.	1.0157936148087876
Despite some unfulfilled expectations and complaints, the postoperative life situation of HTx patients appeared significantly improved.	0.9495171711084481
Sevoflurane is a "new" volatile inhaled anaesthetic.	0.8473321489357685
Owing to its lower blood-gas solubility coefficient, emergence from anaesthesia is faster with sevoflurane than with isoflurane, enflurane, or halothane.	0.977359558591366
Sevoflurane undergoes metabolic biodegradation, releasing inorganic fluoride ions that could produce nephrotoxicity.	0.7254893981850958
In this study, we compared serum inorganic fluoride concentrations (IFCs) in patients receiving either sevoflurane or enflurane.	1.1735311479021135
Furthermore, indices of renal function were evaluated until the 3rd postoperative day.	1.1648195391299707
Background: Rarely, an additional Brown's syndrome develops spontaneously in cases of posttraumatic bilateral superior oblique palsy.	1.2822292101136223
Surgical measures are controversial and problematic.	0.6448208241667851
Metastasis formation is a multistep process that requires tumor cells to progress through many different stages.	0.8478981351398506
One of the first steps is a disturbance of the epithelial integrity through a decrease in intercellular homotypic adhesion.	1.1688038102365637
Proteolysis of the extracellular matrix, as well as increased locomotion, leads to intravasation and dissemination of the tumor cells.	0.9387359829258517
In the target organs metastasizing cells adhere to the endothelium, extravasate and form metastases.	0.8150640206465334
Finally, neoangiogenesis is required for the initiation as well as the growth of the metastases, providing the tumor cells with both nutritive agents and growth factors.	1.339266923934758
This leads to the conclusion that anti-proteolytic and anti-angiogenic substances could provide effective therapeutic approaches for the control of metastatic growth.	1.0157080350523908
Whether or not this goal can be accomplished by synthetic or endogenous drugs must still be demonstrated by basic and definitive clinical research.	0.9285068970957925
Purpose: The purpose of this study was to present our experience and results with arthroscopic resection of the acromioclavicular joint.	1.0950046531833646
Urodynamic examinations were performed in 82 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer before and after radical prostatectomy.	0.9797779631954682
A significant decrease in bladder capacity (396 ml to 331.9 ml), urethral closure pressure (89.6 cm H2O to 65.,2 cm H2O) and functional profile length (61 mm to 25.9 mm) was noted.	1.3443579153814609
The continence rate after radical prostatectomy was 33.4 % after 1 month, 69.4 % after 3 months, 84.7 % after 6 months, and 90.9 % after 12 months, respectively.	1.2661003027463114
A correlation was found between urethral closure pressure and functional profile length and continence.	0.8157111323316695
A second urodynamic examination was performed 6 months after radical prostatectomy.	0.8270928817090869
Functional profile length and urethral closure pressure increased.	0.6620612056633526
These data suggest that restoration of continence is based on sphincteric parameters.	0.7092344497861716
We are interested in the interaction of high-energy ultrasound with biological tissue with regard to cancer therapy.	0.978288651952451
The physical and biological aspects of this are reviewed and summarized in this paper.	1.0540593039809478
The preliminary results give reason to hope, as ultrasound is easy to focuse and might be applicable as a supplementary therapeutic technique in ultrasound-accessible tumors.	1.0182818668050018
The changes observed in biological studies are clearly a function of the pyhsical parameters.	0.8111334210042231
Therefore, it is possible to calculate and predict the biological effects.	1.243182020620054
Recent results have shown the potential of magnetic resonance imaging in monitoring ultrasound therapy online.	1.1128799597735515
The capability of MRI to measure temperature will be an important tool for the safe and reliable application of this new therapeutic approach.	1.242819661889763
The role of ultrasound therapy in the management of human tumors must be clarified in carefully conducted clinical trials.	0.9367257622116579
Posttraumatic deformities after pediatric fractures are either the result of incomplete or failed remodeling, complete or partial stimulation of the growth plates, or complete or partial closure of a growth plate.	1.0866226457762935
In contrast to fractures of the upper extremities, spontaneous remodeling should not be intentionally integrated in the treatment algorithm.	1.3355687954532387
In the context of the quality assurance program of the German pension insurance institutions, instruments and procedures have been developed in the past few years in order to assess the quality of structure, process, and results of inpatient rehabilitation, as well as patient satisfaction.	1.2015910774518526
The routine implementation of these procedures aims at providing rehabilitation hospitals with fast information on shortcomings in their current practice, so that concepts of treatment and - in the long run - effects of rehabilitation can be systematically improved.	1.2585509599311393
When the "quality profiles" of rehabilitation hospitals are compared ("benchmarking"), paying institutions of rehabilitation could gain information on the cost-quality-ratio of particular hospitals as well as important leads for improving the steering processes of patients and hospitals.	1.2592491190468658
In the present article, results of a first "field-run" of the procedures for measuring patient satisfaction and quality of rehabilitation processes are reported.	1.450803703039017
A comparative analysis of patient satisfaction in four orthopaedic/rheumatologic rehabilitation hospitals showed high degrees of overall satisfaction in all hospitals.	0.8582737663421859
In several subdimensions of patient satisfaction, however, significant differences between hospitals were found.	1.1781129020220094
Quality of rehabilitation processes - as assessed by a standardized peer-review - varied substantially between 36 hospitals.	1.1870423401398515
Problems of quality were found especially in some dimensions that must be considered as crucial for rehabilitation, e.g., in the history and diagnosis of disabilities, in the consideration of psycho-social problems, or in the assessment of occupational capacities.	1.2510781947711214
The analysis of THR-failures showed that the acetabular component still is the main problem of total hip replacement.	1.0663556782072814
The acetabular cup fails more often than the stem.	0.7801662125715446
In the midterm analysis the failure rate is a little bit higher in cementless than in cement fixed cups.	0.9730142583443522
The known effect that the failure rate of cups fixed with cement increases exponentially 8 to 10 years after implantation, could of course not be seen in this study.	1.0679791083798007
The success of the cementless fixation was negatively influenced by the diagnosis rheumatoid arthritis, age over 70 and the fixation manner: the failure rate of threaded cups was higher than the one of pressfit cups although the Zweymüller-cup as well as the Link type V-cup showed good results.	1.1755059790993005
The midterm results of the stem were very good for the cementless as for the cemented technique.	0.9644055425405882
Some implants showed compared to others significantly worse results.	0.7266720481348854
The further implantation should be thought of, what partially has already happened.	0.8459114416542003
The results of cementless stem fixation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthrosis and dysplastic osteoarthritis is comparable, so that cementless fixation should be thought of in case of adequate conditions (ability of partial weight bearing for some weeks, age under 60).	1.0713494714113927
Type I and type II diabetes are the most common types of diabetes.	1.1632252869708195
The ratio of type I to type II diabetes is about 1:9.	1.070996616821377
Type I diabetes is caused by an absolute insulin deficiency and is therefore referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes.The disease becomes manifest clinically in childhood or adolescence ("juvenile diabetes"), although manifestation in adulthood is being increasingly observed.	1.2194488661930376
Morphologically, a subtotal ( > 80 %) to total loss of beta cells in the pancreatic islets occurs.	1.2858383944677674
Lymphocytic insulitis, which disappears after the beta cells have been totally destroyed, is pathognomonic of type I diabetes.	1.1407191480823833
This insulitis is an expression of an autoimmune event that is triggered by a multitude of factors.	0.8353870235387184
An important factor appears to be a genetic predisposition (HLA DR3/DR4/DQ8) in connection with as yet unknown environmental factors (e. g., viruses).	1.1049219224225502
Autoantibodies, such as islet cell cytoplasmic antibodies (ICA), insulin autoantibodies (IAA), and/or autoantibodies to the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid carboxylase (GAD), are already detectable in a prediabetic phase, although it is not possible to predict the time of clinical manifestion.	1.214538182279268
The course of the disease is dependent on age.	1.1815674236537461
Young children require insulin therapy sooner than juveniles or adults.	0.635398665531168
This article summarizes data from recent studies on the prevalence, diagnosis and therapy of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children.	1.2452720652367466
The prevalence of this disorder in 4-6 year old children is 0.7%.	1.15361249238671
Leading clinical sign in 90% of patients is habitual snoring, but this is rather nonspecific, as 60% of patients investigated for habitual snoring do not have OSAS.	1.421436449878851
Other signs such as daytime sleepiness, failure to thrive, profuse nocturnal sweating or mouth breathing are equally nonspecific.	0.7523884865741424
The diagnosis, therefore, has to be confirmed by polysomnography, where OSAS is suggested by the occurrence of >5 obstructive apneas/hypopneas per hour of sleep in conjunction with a CO2 of >50 mmHg for >8% of sleep time and/or >1 desaturation to <=90%/h.	1.291875340508048
Patients with progressive cancer and their families face a series of existential crises with each stage of disease up to terminal stages in which palliative treatment is begun, and patients come to accept the inevitability of death.	1.0532274381619038
This can lead to a unique, highly emotional situation with direct or indirect, open or hidden, varied and very personal manifestations.	0.9184748990945704
The dermatological clinic in Homburg was founded in 1945.	0.670750038491086
In 1947 it was integrated into the Saarland University as a dermatology department.	0.7839078052482219
A review of the history of the clinic documents advances and challenges in clinical dermatology, as well as new developments in related basic research during the last 50 years.	0.9239113587848781
The coexistence of carotid artery stenosis with coronary artery disease occurs in a small percentage of patients requiring open heart surgical procedures.	1.0717917299156248
Whether the combined surgical approach favorably influences the outcome of patients requiring major cardiac operations remains controversial.	0.9307689614117651
We report the successful thrombectomy of the internal carotid artery.	0.9437927483017958
A 33-year-old woman suffered from ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome after treatment with FSH/HCG for in-vitro fertilization.	0.9749944005139716
She developed a transient left hemiparesis.	0.6470276274692687
This was caused by a floating thrombus located in the internal carotid artery.	0.761642846205655
Open surgical treatment with thrombectomy prevents recurrent neurological symptoms.	0.8295728520258938
The development of hand eczema is a relatively commonly seem dermatosis in housewives.	0.9468019976791978
In 1986 we presented a first survey of potential contact dermatitis sources for a housewife.	0.8863885513937733
Now, we present an update in which we analyse the different contact sources in the household and grade them in comparison to the data of 1986.	1.205222884854473
The results are based on the analysis of a large population of 2633 patients with the occupation "housewife" and the diagnosis "eczema" who have been seen in departments of dermatology belonging to the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK).	1.1724160016319705
Data for HIV infection on transmission probabilities per contact are of widely differing quality.	0.7782811672116222
Estimates of infection probabilities after sexual exposures are the most problematic, even though sexual exposure is the most frequent transmission risk.	1.1766680880771723
Extrapolations of data from discordant couple cohort studies and from US seroincidence studies may be seriously biased.	0.8072535516982546
Infectivity of and susceptibility to HIV may be influenced by concomitant STDs, antiretroviral therapy, alloimmunization and/or subinfectious virus exposures and thus may show a wide range of inter- and intraindividual variability.	0.9878923700832241
Differences in factors influencing transmission probability of HIV most likely outweigh differences in sexual behaviour in explaining the differences in epidemic spread of HIV.	0.9056934011915032
Between January 1989 and March 1997, 175 patients with traumatic shoulder dislocations were treated by conservative means (median age 41 years, 39 F, 136 M).	1.0419995109013624
In 78 patients (17 F, 61 M) a clinical and radiological follow up (median 50 months, range 6-106) could be obtained.	1.3090981251964129
Additionally, a diagnostic ultrasound was carried out in all patients.	1.2654624586853203
The recurrence rate in the group younger than 30 years (G < 30; n = 35) was 86 %; in the group older than 30 years (G > 30; n = 43) it was 21 % (P < 0.05).	1.2378426502046231
Persisting neurological deficits were found in 6 patients (8 %).	0.9242622621314879
According to the Rowe score, 16 patients (46 %) of the G < 30 achieved excellent or good results, in the G > 30, 29 patients (67 %).	1.2444223946369324
In 17 % of cases, a glenohumeral arthrosis was diagnosed be radiological means.	0.9344765054481304
18 % had radiological signs of a previous fracture of the greater tuberosity.	1.2379105956834011
Hill-Sachs lesions were identified in 19 % of cases.	0.9043189053933383
Rotator cuff tears were diagnosed in 9 % by ultrasound.	1.1682687194986072
No relationship between the duration of immobilization and the recurrence rate was found (P = 0.95).	1.0318185681879946
The recurrence rate following primary shoulder dislocation depends primarily on the patients' age.	1.008770851769593
We analyzed quality assurance protocol records of 532 geriatric hospital patients in comparison to an administration database concerning data on "length of stay" information (LOS).	0.9141289482596375
Doctors handwritten quality assurance protocol records corresponded in 74.25% of cases to administration data.	1.1041642197663066
14.47% of cases were registered with different LOS; 11.28% of LOS information was missing.	1.2683213982647856
The increasing amount of documentation tasks in German geriatric hospitals is discussed.	0.7583473045009322
Conclusion: We assume that not only discrete well known information (admission and discharge dates, LOS) are contaminated by documentation failure but also data on functional status of geriatric patients which may have important influence on external data processing.	1.15823188098422
The majority of patients with symptomatic spondylolysis can be treated conservatively.	1.0519218108762465
Only when symptoms persist in spite of conservative treatment surgery may be indicated.	0.9340862743526467
In young patients, however, fusion of a mobile segment should be avoided, but a direct repair of the pars defect can be attempted.	1.32158957961778
This procedure allows complete healing and possibly avoids degeneration of the intervertebral disk.	0.7900351826150954
For this purpose Morscher developed the hook screw, which connects the arch with the anterior articular process.	1.0477724301828633
It allows compression of the defect without crossing the defect with the screw.	0.9189018931829774
A follow-up study of the first 33 patients with a follow-up time of 3.5 years on average showed a good subjective result in 79 % of the patients.	1.3845735905630423
In patients younger than 20 years of age, however, the result was good in 87.5 % of cases.	0.9795867871401531
The reason for the better results in young patients is that in older patients the origin of the pain is often not the pars defect, but the degeneration of the intervertebral disk.	1.2498945774669075
Direct repair of spondylolysis is therefore indicated when pain persists after 6 months of conservative treatment or there is a progressive olisthesis of not more than 10 mm.	1.0830770145522555
After the end of growth an MRI study of the intervertebral discs should show whether there is degeneration or not.	1.0355856759412998
Direct repair is indicated only in the absence of disc degeneration.	0.8837183414721475
After the age of 25 years this procedure should not be carried out.	0.9920847049171261
We are presenting a 47-year-old woman who was stung by jellyfish while bathing in the sea of Thailand.	0.89329608601816
Immediately after the injury she developed sharp pain and urticarial erythema of the skin of the knees accompanied by muscle cramps of the entire body.	1.0928839636365135
After a few days a toxic contact dermatitis with edematous swelling and ulcerations developed, which did not respond to topical antibiotics or corticosteroids.	0.9342090225470238
Three weeks later the patient presented with a disseminated urticarial eruption, which at first responded well to topical treatment and systemic corticosteroids.	1.1023669562385268
Over the next few weeks, however, a relapse of the eruption and the ulcerations occurred.	1.0801157919048365
Raised titres of IgG and IgM antibodies against different jellyfish from the Indian and Pacific Ocean were detected in the patient's serum by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.	0.9245241690664046
Antibodies against bees (class 1) and wasps (class 4) were found by the radioallergosorbent test.	1.2939675325211268
The clinical features and the immunological findings led to the diagnosis of toxic and allergic contact dermatitis to jellyfish venom.	0.9881378885995071
First aid and secondary treatment of jellyfish injuries are suggested.	0.7876078282863528
The design of controlled clinical trials on prevention and therapy of arrhythmic events is a difficult task.	0.9265313882902338
In particular in ICD trials, false estimations and omissions have occured that can compromise the interpretation of a trial.	0.9488307777503558
Identification of crucial issues that should be regulated in a study protocol in order to minimize the risk of failure.	0.9885379841316865
Evaluation of the weaknesses of completed antiarrhythmic trials.	0.6814006970297473
Problems in the specification of indications and in the estimation of the effective sample size cannot be solved by the inclusion of mixed populations but require the establishment of development programs.	0.9360312049967624
Further crucial points are the appropriate choice of control and the identical concomittant treatment and observation of the groups to be compared.	1.030658867091725
Technical mistakes as imprecise definitions, arbitrary decisions during the course or at termination of a trial, unclear responsibilities or an unscheduled flow of information can be avoided if these potential problems are anticipated in the trial protocol.	1.0417232160349188
A prospective approach that anticipates problems at the time the study protocol is drafted is preferable to a reluctant reactive approach during the course of the trial.	1.0652781064892767
Ultrasound is the primary imaging modality after kidney transplantation.	0.747121443843396
Its general availability and the absence of radiation exposure and discomfort for the patient also make it a suitable procedure for follow-up.	1.0681095537056458
Simple B-mode sonography provides comprehensive information on the morphology of the renal transplant and surrounding structures, while color-coded duplex sonography (CCDS) additionally allows assessment of the anastomoses and organ perfusion.	0.9846612446168688
More recent technical advances such as power Doppler ultrasound appear to improve in particular the assessment of peripheral circulation.	0.923161265996282
The possibilities and limitations of the various sonographic techniques in the evaluation of kidney transplants are discussed with special reference to the most important clinical aspects and some basic technical concepts.	1.1633646679417584
Purpose: The first morphological changes in eyes with HIV infection are microvascular disease of the retina with cotton-wool spots and microaneurysms.	1.0363525867700458
The study was performed to find out if evidence of disturbances of ocular microcirculation can be established by non-invasive methods.	1.1486330801171207
The operative realignment of mechanical axis deviations (MAD) is necessary to prevent early joint degeneration and to reach normal load-bearing.	1.0176060069268769
Modern types of external fixation systems allow an alignment of the mechanical axis to exact degrees.	0.8956874717154322
Predominantly this are corrections of angular deformities.	0.6707413873288222
In some cases the analysis of the MAD does not show any angular deformity, but a parallel staggering of the mechanical axis lines of a bone.	1.0936227163016115
Such parallel staggering of the mechanical axis lines is defined as a translation deformity of the bone.	0.8988509903394414
In combined deformities with angulation and translation the centre of deformity can be established proximal or distal out of the limit of the bone.	0.9988150375467992
In translation deformities the realignment of the mechanical axis requires a parallel re-staggering made by a translation-osteotomy or by a counterangulated double osteotomy.	0.9022466814466464
In complex deformities with angulation and translation, the translation requires a separate corrective planning.	0.8779490191036841
By using external fixator systems to perform acute or progressive corrective osteotomies the position of the Axis of Correction of Angulation (ACA) in relation to the n-CORA of the deformity has to be considered.	1.0933502648104527
If ACA position is not conform with the n-CORA position relevant geometric effects in relation of length and translation occur.	0.896014827870247
These geometric effects to corrective osteotomies can be calculated by using simple trigonometric formulas or graphical methods.	0.7942615444429265
Possibilities to compensate translation and length effects are shown by using unilateral external fixator systems.	0.9262352304851479
The employers' liability insurance association for victuallers and licensed victuallers has been controlling healing procedures with the aid of a computer program for several years.	0.8481216721177811
The personal data of the injured patient and the precise diagnosis of the injury are used to prepare a forecast of the duration of the treatment and of the patient's inability to work.	1.367506870126141
The basis of this forecast is provided by tables integrated in the program, which have been elaborated by experts on trauma medicine and also constantly refined by them.	1.106539906575198
Meanwhile numerous insurance companies concerned with accidents and trauma have acquired the program and are intending to use it.	0.8302347800731974
The objective is a national database on trauma medicine covering the whole of Germany.	0.7874823498382084
It is intended that its evaluation will help to guarantee the quality of concomitant treatment of trauma victims and also yield some indications on how best to realize the networking of institutions concerned with acute treatment and rehabilitation.	0.9601435624716991
Stroke and its consequences are under medical, sociologic and socioeconomic aspects one of the biggest contemporary challenges.	0.9509920201322979
Due to the demographic development the importance of this disease will further increase.	1.0460231398202182
Nonetheless acute therapy of ischemic stroke up to now was marked by therapeutic nihilism and adherence to empiric therapeutic procedures.	0.908075503416041
Only the admission of rt-Pa in the USA in 1996 for the systemic thrombolysis in ischemic insults less then 3 hours old led to a change in therapeutic strategies.	1.0225298145864528
The good profit-risk-ratio of early thrombolysis with rt-Pa could be confirmed by further studies lately.	0.9382582688274277
In the meantime this therapy was officially recommended by the AHA in the importance of grade A recommendation.	0.8885550623728495
In Europe thrombolysis is equally promoted as the procedure of choice.	0.8522439230329132
At present only few patients receive such a treatment.	0.843212848562972
A thrombolytic therapy can only be provided by a minority of centers due to high requirement in infra-structure.	0.8389679954798532
Furthermore clinic admission often appears with immense loss of time.	0.6569436273745136
Unfortunately also within the clinics there are relevant latencies until therapeutic intervention.	0.8152808115248911
Therefore fundamental requirements for thrombolytic therapy are the indentification of potentially suitable patients and the rapid transfer to an appropriate clinic.	0.9928512015528258
A 69-year-old patient with reduced pulmonary function was diagnosed as suffering from non-small cell lung cancer of the left lung invading the main bronchus, pulmonary artery and left atrium.	1.2174300954393382
Using cardiopulmonary bypass, an extended pneumonectomy with partial resection of the left atrium was performed.	1.1221884268161249
The cardiac defect was closed with a pericardial patch.	0.7197340226932099
The lower lobe was divided ex situ from the upper lobe and reimplanted with anastomosis of the lower pulmonary vein to the left auricle.	1.067571246525636
After a totally uneventful course the patient is in good condition and free of tumor recurrence 2.5 years postoperatively.	1.2508517156100138
In this retrospective study we report the indications, complications and functional and cosmetic results after dermofat grafting into anophthalmic orbits.	1.2031264996906408
The method consists of implantation of autogenous dermis with attached subcutaneous fat from the gluteal region into the orbit.	0.7762309821056168
Twenty-four primary and 4 secondary grafts were implanted in 28 patients aged 12 to 49 years.	0.974817415400053
In the explantation site one patient showed delayed healing.	0.7100834339512234
All implants became integrated, none were lost because of infection or extrusion.	0.9328170214462347
Eleven patients developed minor complications like central ulceration in the dermis, hair growth on the dermis or suture granuloma.	0.8920589283799263
In the primary implant group the functional and cosmetic outcome was evaluated by measurements of the lid structures, exophthalmometry (Hertel) and measuring the prosthesis motility (Kestenbaum).	1.0112241258948553
Three patients showed fair results; all the others had good or very good results.	1.067594626171277
In one case of a secondary implant marked graft atrophy was observed.	1.0372613694007875
Despite the more extensive surgery and some minor complications the safety of this method with good functional and cosmetic results makes dermofat grafting an excellent alternative to heterogenous orbital implants.	1.0413449030261406
Liver tissue from 14 female patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC; stages I-IV) was systematically investigated for the prevalence and distribution of dendritic antigen-presenting cells.	1.0352964136620786
Dendritic cells (DCs) were immunhistochemically identified by use of anti-S 100 protein and KiMlp antibodies.	0.9167328157709491
We confirm previous findings that, in early PBC, S 100 protein-positive DCs can be detected within the lining of bile duct epithelia.	1.152991213811143
However, the present study disclosed that S 100 protein- and KiMlp-positive DCs regularly occur in piecemeal necroses (PMNs) developing in PBC-associated chronic hepatitis.	1.1198929924098981
DCs in PMNs were observed in all PBC stages, but were most prominent in late-stage PBC.	1.1671430384930568
These findings suggest that autoimmune tissue damage in PBC may not be limited to bile ducts, but may also ensue in hepatic parenchyma, producing the pattern of chronic hepatitis with signs of activity.	0.9352532647548768
Health care in emergencies is a social good and a hallmark of a humane society, the ethical foundations of which have to form the basis of all decisions regarding medical emergencies.	1.0762977342997901
The ethics of emergency medical care are part of general medical ethics.	0.9445325552327046
Their principles are outlined and put into perspective with regard to dilemmas characteristic of emergency care.	0.8308647556096407
Due to dwindling resources, the efficiency of emergency medical care is being increasingly scrutinized.	0.9664317105464668
Possibilities of rationalizing care without compromising its quality are being discussed, such as renouncing futile therapy and implementing measures of prevention.	0.9332394028002103
If emergency medical services are to accomplish their mission, however, observing standards of medical practice, legal provisions, and the given framework of society, they must not surrender to pure cost containment.	1.2094472195203185
We performed a phase II trial with second-line chemotherapy in patients with refractory, metastatic cancer of the bladder.	0.9292657147217748
Second-line therapy consists of 2.6 cycles of mitomycin-C, 5-fluorouracil and folic acid.	0.9632847754437709
Two patients suffered from WHO grade III side effects (nephrotoxicity, leukocytopenia).	0.7911803409132594
We did not find any complete or partial remission.	0.711699738837901
Four patients had a stable disease; 3.3 months after therapy, patients developed tumor progression with a median survival of 9 months.	1.3293395674122561
Four patients reported an improvement in quality of life.	0.7087725847731481
Since all patients received supportive care, improvement in quality of life cannot be related to chemotherapy alone.	1.0387116613334098
In conclusion, second-line chemotherapy with mitomycin-C, 5-fluorouracil and folic acid has no effect on refractory, metastatic cancer of the bladder and is no alternative for cisplatin and methotrexate-based chemotherapy.	0.9428396587906197
Every form of active euthanasia is a punishable offence under § 216 of the Penal Code; nor is there any ethical justification for it from a medical point of view.	0.8564556894250851
The many strands of the movement in favour of making "death on demand" exempt from punishment in Germany as it is in The Netherlands cannot change this.	0.982606653457612
The oral retinoid etretinate (Tigason) has recently been replaced by trans-acitretin (Neotigason) in the treatment of severe psoriasis, primarily because of its short half-life and the assumption that a shorter period of subsequent contraception would be required.	1.1484383223124985
After introduction of the new drug, however, circulating quantities of etretinate were detected in patients treated with trans-acitretin.	1.1120109047398055
Thus far, re-esterification has been detected in at least 83 cases.	1.0342763914766244
The 2-month period of strict contraception initially recommended after oral intake of trans-acitretin has been extended to 2 years, as with etretinate.	1.0925974965251568
We review some aspects of trans-acitretin metabolism, with special emphasis on etretinate formation.	0.9248120337319568
Re-esterification of trans-acitretin into etretinate takes place under varying conditions in volunteers and patients, as well as in animal models.	0.8963020558742073
Ethanol is a co-factor for the enzymatic re-esterification of trans-acitretin.	0.7036088489401724
It is unclear whether the introduction of trans-acitretin has been of any significant benefit to patients.	0.9431481658458026
Monitoring of plasma retinoid levels during and after retinoid therapy remains of decisive importance in managing difficult cases and or in approving decisions for pregnancy.	0.858176305073854
The purpose of this study was to compare the midterm results of the conservative treatment of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures in athletes.	0.8946386852584965
During 1989 and 1990, 279 athletes with ACL ruptures were treated in our Sports Surgery Department, and 221 of them were suitable for inclusion in the study.	1.0154343864909166
The patients were divided into two groups based on management after the diagnosis of ACL rupture had been  made.	0.9464485835980527
Group I (n = 129) underwent ACL reconstruction using free bone-patellar tendon-bone autografts, while group II (n = 92) received conservative treatment.	1.2695176395496208
We were able to evaluate 92 patients during follow-up (42 from group I and 50 from group II).	1.0720279189609851
The average follow-up period was 86 months.	1.100950410261544
There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding the patients' age, sex, or level of sports activity.	1.130968619637146
Follow-up consisted of clinical and radiological examinations and recording of the subjective opinions of the patients.	1.1422235554882956
During follow-up, we used IKDC and OAK scores to evaluate the results.	1.17717485152846
We found significantly better results in the group that was operated on if the patients took part in high-risk pivoting sports, but there was no difference if the patients were in the low-risk or no-risk pivoting group of athletes.	1.3615107663846924
Concerning reoperation and early arthrosis, the difference was significant between the two groups.	1.077769075794317
Background: By depletion of stratospheric ozone, enhanced levels of UV radiation reach the surface of the earth.	1.0397015637200817
Exposure of the anterior parts of the eye to UV radiation leads to irritation of the conjunctival and corneal cells.	1.0158352053487452
The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of a low field strength MRI unit (0.2 T; Esaote, Biomedica) and a high field strength MRI unit (1.5 T; Siemens) in detecting meniscal lesions.	1.1586980022494584
Twenty patients were investigated on a 0.2-T low-field MRI unit and a 1.5-T high-field MRI unit for meniscal lesions.	1.2394464239330754
Evaluation was performed of four meniscal compartments (anterior and posterior medial and lateral meniscus), for a total of 80 observations.	1.277208742639992
The reliability of diagnosis was ranked qualitatively on a three-point scale.	0.9895893805251542
Investigations of the high-field MRI unit revealed a meniscal tear in 6 patients and ruled out a tear in 14 patients.	0.9492151162538661
Evaluation of individual meniscal compartments revealed diagnosis with high confidence in 58 observations and with moderate confidence in 22 observations.	0.6947415653404381
Investigations of the low-field MRI unit revealed a meniscal tear in 5 patients and ruled out tears in 15 patients.	0.8960549637598022
Evaluation of individual meniscal compartments revealed diagnosis with high confidence in 39 observations, with moderate confidence in 38 observations, and with low confidence in 3 observations.	1.0231868224907528
The diagnosis in high- and low-field images was identical in 98.7 % of cases; in one patient observations from the high-field unit changed the therapeutic management.	1.3605358488197452
Diagnostic reliability was significantly higher with highfield strength MR imaging.	0.8024793033615527
Low field strength MR imaging shows comparatively high diagnostic accuracy for meniscal lesions compared to high field strength imaging; however, we demonstrated a significantly higher confidence in diagnosis with high-field MR imaging.	1.208654344328066
The past decade has seen the successful application of genetic techniques in the dissection of the most important phenotypes of cancer cells.	1.0145303952566425
In the case of drug resistance mechanisms, the elucidation of the genes involved in resistance to anticancer agents has led to new and unexpected information about tumor physiology and may well open therapeutic options by virtue of reversing clinical chemoresistance.	0.9985552865581565
The experimental characterization of defined multidrug resistance factors, such as P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance associated protein, topoisomerase, or glutathione-S-transferase in urologic malignancies, is now relatively comprehensive, allowing for an initial analysis.	1.0317315897359376
Clinical studies on some of these concepts have been started and will be the subject of careful scrutinity.	1.0797690807775624
We expect that they will have a considerable impact on the way certain urologic anticancer strategies will be pursued in the future.	0.8631100263872078
A study was carried out to determine the risk of dysesthesia of the inferior alveolar and of the lingual nerve after molar surgery.	1.0653726164650168
A total of 1103 impacted lower wisdom teeth and 3 impacted lower second molars were removed in 687 patients, all of whom with unaltered sensibility preoperatively.	0.9120240548410891
Clinical, radiological, and surgical factors of each case were recorded.	1.0526909726465956
Postoperative disturbances in the sensibility of the lip and tongue were evaluated by neurological examination.	0.9554210073136841
Follow-up was carried out for a maximum of 35 weeks.	1.0528736997992414
Dysesthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve occurred with an incidence of 3.57%.	0.8520304900939161
The lingual nerve was injured in 2.1% of patients.	0.9750939127122399
Most of the initially reported alterations in sensation resolved within the follow-up period.	0.8921598226652666
Dysesthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve persisted in 0.91%, and of the lingual nerve in 0.37%.	0.9622347542570348
However, the extent of the prolonged impairment was slight in general.	1.0531271844193855
The effect of the documented factors on the incidence of dysesthesia was analyzed.	0.8401324480715466
For the inferior alveolar nerve, analysis revealed significant effects in older patients, for completely developed roots, for deeply impacted teeth, in the radiological relationship of the roots and the inferior alveolar canal, for difficult surgery, and for intraoperative exposure of the nerve.	1.352185793950803
The surgeon and the anesthesia had a significant influence on lingual dysesthesia.	0.8469103434771864
Background: This review of radiological and other procedures used in the diagnosis of (chronic) low-back pain is not intended to provide a complete evaluation of the methods employed, because the validity, specificity and sensitivity of the various diagnostic measures are the subject of so much controversy that a comprehensive discussion would be beyond the scope of the present overview.	1.40026362528004
The choice of method depends not only on the clinical symptoms but also on the localisation of the pain, the aetiology of which may also be related to the age of the patient.	1.1403038693476941
Enteritis and pseudoappendicitis are typical manifestations of Yersinia infections in children.	0.7180637711078823
This is a report on a child with localised tumourous mesenteric lymphadenitis due to Yersinia enterocolitica persistent for a long time.	0.962590020902389
We found specific antibodies against Yersinia outer membrane proteins repeat-edly in the patients' serum.	1.0163306730267097
Only after a ciprofloxacin therapy for 16 weeks we observed a recovery of our patient.	0.9123993697916934
The present study investigates patients' expectations toward radiotherapy and their associations to quality of life and physician judgements.	1.1646250954296922
Fifty-five patients with tumors of different sites (30 with previous tumor-related surgery, 25 without surgery) admitted to the department of radiotherapy filled out a standardized questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30, PLC by Siegrist et al., therapy-related expectations and success) before and after inpatient radiotherapy.	1.158836971908512
The corresponding physician ratings were collected.	0.5435935642510736
Fifty-eight percent of the patients expected the therapeutic goal "healing", whereas from the physician's standpoint this was realistic in only 7 % of cases.	1.1940604613246544
The specific radiotherapy-related expectations "tumor control" and "pain relief" reached almost the same levels in patients and physician (71 % vs 71 % and 40 % vs 44 %).	1.3604369801928027
Patients with healing expectancy reported higher quality of life at the beginning of the therapy (53.4 % vs 39.9 %); patients expecting pain relief reported lower quality of life (37.1 % vs 54.5 %).	1.2352304488458745
Surgical patients who had been operated on within the past year (n = 18) showed a particularly high healing expectancy (83 %), whereas patients whose operation dated back more than 1 year focused on pain relief as therapeutic goal (83 %).	1.096338276857316
The surgeon, as the primary contact person for patients, can influence patients' therapy-related expectations.	1.233099450723881
In explaining the overall therapeutic strategy, surgeons should also mention the scope and limits of adjuvant therapies.	0.8862718648424588
The meanings of the terms "quality", "quality of care", and "quality management" were clarified with common international definitions.	1.4059503701246854
Based on that, the basic ideas, concepts, and objectives of quality management in medicine were explained.	1.1564150038683203
Finally some future trends related to quality were viewed, which represent challenges for the medical profession and entire medicine.	1.101299635220535
The papular-purpuric "gloves and socks" syndrome (PPGSS) was first described in 1990 by Harms et al.	0.6970664367365821
The syndrome is characterised by fever, an itchy erythema with edema, confluent papules and purpura of the hands and feet in a "gloves and socks" distribution.	0.8316063926060479
The skin lesions may be associated with purpura and superficial erosions of the oral mucosa.	1.0280421076421775
Viral infections, in particular parvovirus B19, are the most likely trigger.	1.3221141950388606
In the present case PPGSS developed after taking trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.	0.9743955958533425
Since the patient developed identical symptoms after accidental re-challenge with the same drug, this case strongly suggests medications as another factor in the pathogenesis of PPGSS.	1.1181142690220454
Most fractures of the clavicle heal well with nonoperative treatment.	0.9738325504188695
On rare occasions, malunited clavicular fractures are associated with a pattern of disability that includes not only pain but also functional or neurovascular impairment.	0.906377513897899
In these cases, clavicular osteotomy and correction of the deformity should be considered.	0.8375492478844946
In four patients with a malunited fracture of the clavicle following nonoperative treatment, we performed a clavicular osteotomy for deformity.	1.1452568580391866
In all four patients the clavicular fracture healed with shortening associated with pain and ipsilateral glenohumeral dysfunction.	0.9642645200201392
The deformity was not associated with neurovascular dysfunction.	0.7319823781701478
In preoperative X-ray studies, the shortening of the malunited clavicle was between 0.9 and 2.2 cm in comparison to the contralateral clavicle.	1.401435962292794
All patients underwent an extension osteotomy of the clavicle with interposition of an autogenous iliac crest bone graft.	0.9531338431612577
The follow-up was 1 - 4 years postoperatively.	1.3060990191447521
The functional outcome was evaluated using the Constant-Murley and the UCLA score.	0.9673456844538418
All patients had immediate pain relief following osteotomy and correction of the deformity.	0.9216564508790921
The shoulder function rapidly improved, and the functional outcome was good in three out of the four patients.	1.233601073446843
If there is associated functional impairment in malunited clavicular fractures, extension osteotomy combined with autogenous bone grafting may produce predictably good results.	0.9295709835607648
As the importance of laparoscopic surgery for benign diseases of the gastrointestinal tract continues to grow, the application of this approach in cases of malignancy remains controversial.	1.039757362702368
Although the concept of cancer recurrence in the area of surgical wounds is not new, the incidence of port site recurrence is the most obvious concern.	1.2065677514558024
Indications and contraindications for surgery as well as a standardized nomenclature describing the type of laparoscopic procedures being performed are some other issues that need to be clarified.	1.0133938558487585
Complete laparoscopic procedures or the combination of laparoscopy with open techniques can offer advantages and disadvantages that surgeons will have to take into consideration when making decisions.	1.038786663202346
The skill of the operating team and the extent of disease define the boundaries of laparoscopic surgery possible.	0.9831210838424468
The continued research as well as development of intelligent instruments and standardized techniques might give laparoscopy a clear role in the treatment of abdominal malignancies.	0.977617793602705
Background: The mechanical stabilization of the cornea in keratoconus may delay progression of this disease.	1.1027618987324062
The cross-linking techniques optimized in corneas of enucleated porcine eyes were investigated under in vivo conditions in rabbits to estimate the biocompatibility and duration of the stiffening effect.	0.9546308667414645
In the biopsy material of a polypoid intrabronchial lesion of a 54-year-old male patient with radiologically established lung tumor, spindle-cell neoplasia was seen.	0.9212214435406548
No clear histogenetic classification of the submucous tumor process was possible.	0.8619498715667508
After resection of the right upper lobe of the lung, including the results of additional immunohistochemical analyses, the tumor was classified as biphasic synovial sarcoma.	1.1800247982266032
This was suggested mostly by immunohistochemical detection of the epithelial membrane antigene (EMA) and of vimentin.	1.1342392881556438
Extensive clinical examinations ruled out the possibility of a primary tumor with extrapulmonary localization.	1.0575796223730654
This case report shows the problems faced in correctly classifying the histogenesis or the direction of differentiation in extremely rare cases of primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma.	1.0840976768003725
Especially in small biopsy samples showing a submucous spindle-cell tumor of the lung, apart from frequent sarcoma metastases, the presence of primary synovial sarcoma of the lung has to be considered in the differential diagnosis.	1.025562117458114
Necrotizing pancreatitis is still associated with considerable morbidity and mortality.	0.8503495721695647
Formerly, surgical treatment with early and extensive pancreatic resection has been the standard.	1.2684851643598538
Improvements in our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease and progress in the field of intensive care therapy have made conservative therapy the initial standard in the treatment of necrotizing pancreatitis.	1.1466267499404772
A considerable percentage of patients with sterile necrosis can be managed with low morbidity and mortality by conservative treatment without operation.	1.1267732006097142
Nevertheless, surgical treatment is indicated in patients with infected necrosis and in sterile necrosis if multiorgan failure persists over a limited period of time despite maximum intensive care therapy.	1.2302739800663647
Pancreatic resection should be abandoned for surgical treatment of pancreatic necrosis, as results with regard to morbidity, mortality and long-term outcome are unsatisfactory.	1.195251574860306
Today the surgical standard is careful digital necrosectomy, which must be followed by either postoperatve drainage, repeated open lavage or continuous closed lavage.	0.9714510526369106
In experienced hands, all three procedures provide similar results with regard to morbidity and mortality.	1.0107179636766008
The aim of quality management in rheumatology is to improve care and outcome in patients with rheumatic diseases.	1.2807593381870863
This can be achieved by means of prospective long-term observation of the patient with regular documentation of clinical, radiological, biochemical and functional data using certain validated scoring methods (DAS, radiological score, ADL score Hanover or Health assessment questionnaire, SF36, etc.).	1.0331991039423984
Long-term observation and documentation including radiographs have been performed in the rheumatology hospital in Ratingen for 20 years without even knowing the term quality management.	0.9998788394255199
Quality management in a hospital for rheumatic diseases begins with certain structural prerequisites: possibility of direct admission of a patient to the hospital by the family physician, outpatient clinic to investigate and to follow patients over a long period of time, multidisciplinary team with specialists in rheumatology, orthopedic surgery, physiotherapy, ergotherapy, special care, psychological, and social services, close cooperation with specialists in neurology, dermatology, ophthalmology, etc., department of radiology, special laboratory, facilities for internal diagnostics and treatment.	1.1590333537137334
The hospital needs a training program for the qualification of rheumatologists and orthopaedic surgeons.	0.7219607383064189
The hospital staff should closely cooperate with the doctors in private practice who admit patients and should continously support patient organizations.	0.8761676043544675
The quality of outcome is influenced by the process quality which depends on the following factors: selection, training and motivation of the hospital staff; supervision of clinical assessment and documentation by senior physicians, daily x-ray demonstrations and case reports, interdisciplinary case demonstrations at least every week in addition to daily consultation, team reports, regular education including review of actual literature for physicians, education programs exchanging knowledge with physiotherapists and nurses, and regular education programs for patients.	1.0946423245247083
Process quality can only be achieved by an interdisciplinary approach and regular communication between all participants including the patient, whose opinion must be noted and regarded.	1.0129739668220805
As far as possible, the same doctor who treats the patient in the hospital should follow her/him in the outpatient clinic.	1.1609593974348624
The quality of outcome can be improved by regular reinvestigation of the patient with control of medication, side effects, efficacy, documentation of clinical, biochemical, radiological, and functional data.	1.1099738623408513
Decisions for further treatment have to be based on these follow-up data.	1.1519050388413714
A standardized follow up and documentation system for all rheumatology units with prompt feedback could definitely improve the quality of rheumatologic care in Germany.	0.8470121358558552
Two children on chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) had initially focal, then generalized seizures of short duration.	1.069042989028748
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed in one case minor parietal, cortical and subcortical increased signal on T2-weighted images.	0.9178303487386489
In a second case extended supratentorial lesions and additional signal changes in the cerebellum were found.	1.0005124318720833
Although chemotherapy was continued, a few days later signal changes were considerably reduced or had disappeared.	1.120783113764288
We consider these lesions to be seizure induced in a brain previously sensitized by chemotherapy.	0.8348874139395269
Hydatid disease is caused by the parasitic tapeworm Echinococcus.	0.6800248286345905
The larval stage of this parasite can thrive in many parts of the body, most frequently in the liver.	1.0229273458589578
Primary bone location is very rare, accounting for less than 2 % of all hydatid lesions.	1.1691694236350796
We report on a case of left-sided extended pelvic infestation.	1.043635500064545
The destruction of the hip joint, os pubis, large parts of the ileum and the femoral head made pelvic resection and prosthetic replacement necessary.	0.991322373644846
Recurrence of a hydatid cyst 5 years later in the left groin originating from the proximal femur was treated with second femoral resection and new total hip replacement.	1.068898314469712
Because of instability, the primarily inserted polyacetal pelvic replacement had to be exchanged for a custom-made device fabricated with the aid of computer-aided design (CAD) techniques.	0.9384689582484388
This surgical procedure was combined with chemotherapy (mebendazole).	0.8003833683301672
The necessity of radical resection in osseus hydatid disease is discussed.	0.8337888231343538
At present, phosphodiesterase III inhibitors are commonly used for the treatment of low cardiac output states.	0.9817196092641844
Despite their positive inotropic and lusitropic effects, these drugs are still under discussion because of certain adverse effects like thrombopaenia, elevation of transaminases, abdominal disregulation, and excessive periphereal vasodilatation.	1.0947972442170155
As a consequence, more cardioselective phosphodiesterase inhibitors were developed with the aim of reducing these adverse effects.	1.1741627424992755
One of them, enoximone (Marion Merrell Dow, Fig.	0.7536310539365553
1), an imidazole derivative, has nearly no influence on platelets and abdominal organ function.	1.2215772063683152
In addition, in many studies vasodilatation was found to be absent.	1.2573036142504204
Recently a new substance, R80122 (Janssen, Belgium, Fig.	0.7936980635281013
1), was developed.	1.4396794866348437
First experimental studies showed high cardioselectivity of this substance.	0.833490216424328
The aim of this study was to compare the haemodynamic effects of enoximone and R80122 in patients with ischaemic heart disease.	0.8275262549760661
The extremely rare finding of a proximal radio-ulnar synostosis in a 5 years-old girl with a fetal alcohol syndrome is presented.	0.9601907989432396
Despite the elbow's being fixed at 30  ° pronation, the patient exhibits good ipsilateral arm function.	1.10618039499751
The difficulties in differential diagnosis and treatment modalities are discussed.	1.1495786242764348
Ischemic preconditioning (IP), using one or more brief periods of ischemia before a sustained ische- mia, represents a new approach in reducing ischemia-induced skeletal muscle damage.	1.110842783949849
The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of IP on skeletal muscle function after 3 h ischemia and 2 h reperfusion in a rodent model.	0.9200556746117573
IP protocols using one, two, or three preconditioning cycles of 10 min ischemia and 10 min reperfusion each, were compared to non-preconditioned controls.	1.1581999876483944
IP was found to significantly improve force, performance, endurance, and contractility of postischemic skeletal muscle.	1.0200530032419812
The efficacy of IP- induced protection was correlated with the number of preconditioning cycles.	0.8331885134232353
Preconditioning with three cycles resulted in a more effective protection as compared to one or two cycles.	1.1031106951310248
Altogether, this study describes the efficacy of IP in improving post-ischemic muscle function and the need of more than one IP cycle to achieve this improvement.	1.2327275073202266
The respective clinical potential warrants further exploration.	0.5738950399180703
Pachyonychia congenita (PC) is a rare ectodermal dysplasia with variable expression.	0.8803074803093837
The condition is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.	0.9124462742390974
Several classifications of PC have been proposed.	0.7704542795274567
Feinstein and colleagues suggested four clinical types of PC.	0.6377310346519939
Type II, the Jackson-Lawler-Syndrome, is characterized by multiple epidermal cysts, palmoplantar bullae and hyperhidrosis as well as natal teeth in addition to the main findings of pachyonychia, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and follicular keratosis.	1.0119972061996867
We report two patients (father and son) with Jackson-Lawler-Syndrome and describe in detail pathogenesis, diagnostic criteria and treatment approaches as well as the different classifications of pachyonychia congenita.	1.2380549148050697
Aim of this review article was to critically analyse the recently described zytogenetic and molecular markers for testicular germ cell tumors with regard to their clinical utility.	1.1950544917900356
The isochromosome i(12p) represents the most common and characteristic cytogenetic finding which already appears in testicular carcinoma in situ.	0.9422481674213327
A number of proto - oncogenes (Cyclin D and PTHLH) as well as putative tumor suppressor genes are localized on 12p; however, their role in pathogenesis and prognosis of testicular germ cell tumors has not been defined yet.	1.0310627782702537
Clinical characteristics of patients with familial testicular germ cell tumors indicate a genetic background for the development of testicular tumors.	0.9113346984134081
Although a number of chromsomal loci encoding potential testicular tumor susceptibility genes have been identified, the genetic basis of testicular cancer pathogenesis is still unknown.	0.9520051774523635
With regard to molecular prognostic risk factors most of the reported data on proliferation markers, tumor suppressor genes, proteases and adhesion molecules have to be confirmed in prospective randomized trials prior to their widespread clinical use.	1.0645053128262834
Based on the available data on prospective studies percentage of embryonal carcinoma and vascular invasion appear to be the most significant prognosticators.	1.1857282725231342
Investigation and identification of those factors determining the aggressive biologic behavior of embryonal carcinoma compared to all other histological components appear to be most promising in research for prognosticators of metastatic disease.	0.9006649948632975
After laparoscopic cholecystectomy, carbon dioxide (CO2) must be exhaled after resorption from the abdominal cavity.	0.8006315892146152
There is controversy about the amount and relevance of postoperative CO2 resorption.	0.8794493548906968
Without continuous postoperative monitoring, after laparoscopic cholecystectomy a certain risk may consist in unnoticed hypercapnia due to CO2 resorption.	0.9236068572793688
Studies exist on the course of end-expiratory CO2 (PeCO2) alone over a longer postoperative period of time in extubated patients during spontaneous breathing.	1.0816004128328254
The goal of this prospective study was to investigate the amount of CO2 resorbed from the abdominal cavity in the postoperative period by means of CO2 metabolism.	0.9903485238010811
After giving informed consent to the study, which was approved by the local ethics committee, 20 patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy.	1.2740805878984205
All patients received general endotracheal anaesthesia.	0.8081043454372804
After induction, total IV anaesthesia was maintained using fentanyl, propofol, and atracurium.	1.0636123438779364
Patients were ventilated with oxygen in air (FiO2 0.4).	1.0105436007430086
The intraabdominal pressure during the surgical procedure ranged from 12 to 14 mm Hg.	0.940404975507117
Thirty minutes after releasing the capnoperitoneum (KP), CO2 elimination (V.CO2), oxygen uptake (V.O2), and respiratory quotient (RQ) were measured every minute for 1 h by indirect calorimetry using the metabolic monitor Deltatrac according to the principle of Canopy.	1.1964672963222542
Assuming an unchanged metabolism, the CO2 resorption (V.CO2) at any given time (t) can be calculated from V.CO2 (t)=V.CO2 (t)-RQ (preop) V.O2 (t).	1.295497747993058
It was thus necessary to define the patient's metabolism on the day of operation.	1.0834846247407823
The first data were collected before surgery and after introduction of the arterial and venous cannulae for a 15-min period.	1.0612793622207823
Measuring point 0 was determined after exsufflation of the KP and emptying of the remaining CO2 via manual compression by the surgeon at the end of surgery.	1.0468620294944653
Patient's tracheas were extubated and metabolic monitoring started 30 min after release of the KP for 60 min.	0.8710841493615847
Simultaneously, a nasal side-stream capnometry probe was placed and the PeCO2 and respiratory frequency (RF) were obtained by the Capnomac Ultima (Datex) and registered every minute as well.	1.1170113609331715
Values were averaged over four periods of 15 min each.	0.750300663686276
An arterial blood gas sample was drawn at the end of every 15-min period.	0.9179644738771617
Postoperative pain was scored by a visual analog scale and completed by a subjective index questionnaire on general well-being.	0.9254564058185785
All data were analysed by the Friedman or Wilcoxon test; P<0.05 was considered significant.	0.7359982167698309
The findings do not indicate CO2 resorption in the postoperative period after laparoscopic cholecystectomy (Tables 2 and 3, Fig.	1.0371527683288913
Arterial CO2 as well as PeCO2 were elevated postoperatively (45 mm Hg vs. 36 mm Hg intraoperatively), while V.CO2 and V.O2 were unchanged when compared to the preoperative measuring period.	1.211608961414111
The postoperative RF was comparable to preoperative values.	0.7557763926939279
Calculated CO2 was lower than 10 ml/min and within accuracy of measurements.	1.130193721095229
The postoperative pain index ranged between 3 and 4, and 3.75 - 15 mg piritramid was administered.	1.2726149484204374
All patients feld tired immediately after the operation, but scores improved slightly at the end of the 60-min period of metabolic monitoring.	1.0031900201232364
There is no significant resorption of CO2 from the abdominal cavity later than 30 min after releasing the KP.	1.0091673848386535
Up to this time, any CO2 remaining in the abdominal cavity after careful emptying by the surgeon has been resorbed and exhaled.	1.026435205720668
The gene of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4)-inhibitor p16INK4A (CDKN2/MTS1) has been proposed as a candidate for a tumor-suppressor gene located on chromosome 9p21, a frequently deleted region in a series of human cancers including malignant melanoma.	1.0901941886946733
An increasing and sometimes conflicting body of data has accumulated regarding the frequency of homozygous deletions and mutations as well as the importance of p16INK4A in malignant melanoma.	1.0017433892805572
The purpose of this review is therefore to summarize the current knowledge on p16INK4A and to discuss its biologic significance in the pathogenesis of melanocytic tumors.	1.1030621928388573
The prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and disorders in HIV-infected patients is high.	0.9797451355027401
The differential diagnosis includes psychoreactive disorders, acute psychiatric symptoms of an HIV-associated encephalopathy, and symptomatic psychotic illnesses due to secondary neurologic manifestations such as opportunistic central nervous infections and intracerebral lymphoma.	1.1085480584376064
Clinical aspects and psychopathological findings are not sufficient for differential diagnosis and identification of primarily psychiatric disorders.	1.0658355240527753
Secondary neurologic manifestations causing a symptomatic psychosis must be excluded as soon as possible by brain imaging (CT, MRI) and analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid.	1.1862832358261324
In emergency situations, however, German law imposes strict regulations, especially in the case of sectioned patients.	1.0670758541902767
These medical and medicolegal questions are illustrated by case reports and propositions for an effective strategy are made.	0.9017171875827564
In simultaneous bilateral nerve recordings, patients with Sympathetically Maintained Pain (SMP) affecting one limb show similar sympathetic traffic in nerves supplying the affected and unaffected limb, also when the painful limb shows a marked regional autonomic (vasomotor) dysfunction.	0.8988978710799937
These findings argue against the notion that SMP must be mediated by a reflex change in the pattern of sympathetic discharge.	0.8539525829511979
In general, they underline the fact that autonomic effector disturbances may give little information about underlying nerve traffic.	0.9307598074731807
Intraoperative transluminal angioplasty (ITA) has considerably broadened the spectrum of vascular surgical reconstruction, fulfils the requirements of minimally invasive therapy and has thus experienced a rapid development within the past few years.	1.0509416142294437
Whereas the indications and clinical results have been described adequately in the literature, reports on the procedural management of ITA are rare.	1.153504816946696
One of the basic prerequisites of this method is the correct and nontraumatic implantation of the vascular access sheath at the proper location.	1.288074666260169
In the following, the technique of ortho- and retrograde sheath implantation, either through the vessel itself or through a vascular graft, is described in detail.	1.2155612044191368
By respecting particular standards for sheath introduction, ischaemia time and vessel wall injury during ITA can be kept to a minimum.	0.8227464119318931
The importance of the chronology of vascular reconstruction to angioplasty is also elucidated.	0.9281063204835649
In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of sheath implantation compared with direct vessel puncture are demonstrated.	0.9669733616121854
In spite of new developments, including intraluminal fixation of the sheath with an expandable balloon, the "ideal" angioplasty access sheath is, as yet, not available.	1.175767884347301
In several cases of lupus erythematosus (SLE, SCLE, DLE), the Koebner phenomenon could be seen in the apparently normal skin of patients following traumas, scratching effects, operation scars, contact dermatitis, pressure from sock tops, application of liquid nitrogen, exposure to strong sun light, etc.	0.9827608288342993
The interval between exposure to such provocation factors and appearance of the isomorphic reactions varied from case to case.	0.8871320711724782
In SLE patients receiving systemic treatment with glucocorticosteroids, the Koebner phenomenon could not be found, while it was detected in patients with generalized DLE who had never received any systemic glucocorticoid hormones.	1.1222858966712939
It was not seen in patients with localized DLE.	0.9129739744146368
There was no direct relationship between the appearance of humoral autoantibodies and onset of the Koebner phenomenon.	0.9864280318309187
With regard to the histopathogenesis of the Koebner phenomenon, it is thought that disturbances of the local cellular repair processes and of the cytokine network, with expression of adhesion molecules, might be involved.	1.136419973549625
The Koebner phenomenon may be a valuable model for the investigation of lupus erythematosus.	0.9421849583749677
In 5 years 9 patients with a total of 16 painful ear nodules (chondrodermatitis helicis) have been treated as follows.	1.1705248794183987
A small excision is carried out with local anaesthesia for histological examination.	0.8944764346923402
The rest of the nodule or any other nodules are carbonized by means of the argon laser, also with local anaesthesia, including the surface of the cartilage under the nodules.	1.0500778894613667
There have been no cases of postoperative inflammation or infection.	0.892564158789392
New nodules occurring several months after treatment have been successfully treated in the same way.	1.1892959195340795
There have been no real recurrences.	0.7614845926996165
The cosmetic result is very good in all cases.	0.9972960533131758
The patients are free of pain immediately after the laser therapy.	0.8535379272846871
Laser therapy for painful nodules of the ear has good and lasting results, with a lower rate of recurrences than any other form of treatment.	1.1414179974354348
We represent and discuss etiology, diagnosis as well as differential diagnoses of tuberculous orchtitis referring to an actual case of this rare disease.	1.0176392511687604
In the least of all cases one can conclude from the clinical symptoms on the tuberculous origin of the disease.	1.097685043338393
Other differential diagnoses will set more frequently due to rarity of this disease.	0.7336553119517536
Quite a lot of cases a bacterial superinfection veils the sterile leucocyturia as main characteristic of genitourinary tuberculosis.	0.8410501308945207
Imaging diagnostics frequently fails to give indications of tuberculous origin of the lesion.	0.7924859760147784
As before the evidence of Mycobacteria tuberculosis is the most important parameter to proof a tuberculosis.	1.0126864567452918
Despite required microbiological cultivation to make a resistogram the polymerase chain reaction is a high sensitive and comparable fast method for detection of Mycobacteria even from tissue.	0.9650824472285688
In such dubious cases we recommend to perform an operative denudation due to frequently difficult delimitation from malignant testicular tumours.	0.8490873062003398
In surgical procedures associated with high blood loss, such as vascular and cardiac operations, differential diagnosis and therapy of perioperative hemorrhage are of special importance.	1.1022878065989536
Preoperative screening for patients at high risk of bleeding and in particular for those with qualitative platelet disorders [drug-induced platelet disorders (in particular ASS), von Willebrand's disease and other congenital platelet disorders] is effective in minimizing blood loss.	1.2567669668454342
Bleeding in acute medical emergencies or during emergency operations may require treatment without specific investigations being performed in advance.	0.8900533659812055
Therefore, simple schemes are essential for the rapid management of acute hemostatic problems.	1.310447358919389
The aim of this paper was to address the diagnostic and therapy of hemorrhagic diathesis focusing mainly on diagnosis and therapy of hemorrhagic diathesis due to blood platelet disorders and blood coagulation disorders and preoperative identification of patients at increased risk of bleeding.	1.1390767852539139
Although deep vein thrombosis now has a better prognosis than in the era before anticoagulation, a number of patients remain in whom ulcus cruris cannot be adequately controlled by conservative treatment.	1.0750429600723543
The case report of a 50-year-old woman with stage III chronic venous insufficiency associated with the post-thrombotic syndrome is presented.	1.0302881238299726
Progress in imaging techniques and functional diagnostics of the post-thrombotic syndrome make a reliable differentiation of the chronic venous insufficiency possible with respect to obstruction or reflux.	0.9625627315367318
If conservative treatment fails, autological valve transplantation is described as a suitable reconstructive management method in the treatment of reflux.	0.8954457574659639
Following this report, the results and limitations of this method are discussed.	1.4099482209818233
The neurobiological alterations commonly found in affective disorders (e.g., alterations in the nocturnal sleep profile, dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical system) gradually recover with improvement of the depressive syndrome.	0.8676360400492639
Their persistence during full clinical remission, however, is associated with an increased risk for relapse and, thus may represent trait markers for affective disorders.	1.0045631132147048
In order to test this hypothesis, we designed a prospective study in which healthy first-degree relatives (high-risk probands; HRPs; n=54) of patients with an affective disorder are investigated by means of polysomnography, the combined dexamethasone and corticotropine-releasing hormone (DEX-CRH) test and a variety of psychometric scales.	1.130558151143702
In the present part of the study (index assessment), these HRPs, as a group, showed depressionlike alterations in both the sleep pattern and the DEX-CRH-test outcome; furthermore, their psychometric profile was characterized by elevated scores on the scales assessing "rigidity" and "autonomic lability".	1.3234712580766177
On a single-case level, 35% of the HRPs were identified as conspicuous (depressionlike) in at least two of the three areas investigated.	1.2958297607806089
A decision of whether or not this "conspicuousness" indeed represents a trait marker for affective disorders can be reached when the follow-up part of the study has identified those HRPs with their respective premorbide status who have developed an affective disorder in the meantime.	1.0430780154770343
Undifferentiated connective tissue disease with secondary antiphospholipid syndrome was diagnosed in a 33 year old woman after recurrent arterial thromboses, two miscarriages and myocarditis.	1.067799037994304
Despite effective immunosuppression and anticoagulation her initially mild precapillary pulmonary hypertension progressed in the absence of thromboembolic events, cardiopulmonary disease or other systemic disorders.	0.8754211094681611
iloprost in a dosage of up to 4.5 ng/kg/min for a total of 15 months, her 6 min walking-distance improved from 210 to 315 m, the pulmonary vascular resistance decreased from 1710 to 1111 dynxsxcm-5 and the mean pulmonary arterial pressure decreased from 64 to 54 mmHg.	1.0857409918199792
This partial success of conservative treatment enabled a reassessment of the necessity for heart and lung transplantation.	0.8241025781894431
In the USA, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) has been approved for therapy of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) within a 3 hour time window based on the results of the NINDS [1] trial.	1.037172980757167
Only few patients with AIS are referred to a hospital within three hours after onset of symptoms, and only 3% of these patients qualify for treatment with rt-PA.	1.2025629557505357
Therefore, only few patients with AIS will potentially benefit from therapy with rt-PA if NINDS criteria are applied.	1.144448207185157
The goal of the Second European-Australasian Acute Stroke Study (ECASS II) was to evaluate safety and efficacy of thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA in AIS for a 6 hour time window.	1.1482749964833674
Objective: To prove the response and side effects of sulphasalazine in early and late onset juvenile pauciarthritis, also the therapeutic effect dependent on the marker HLA B27.	1.2112058652523259
The radiologic imaging methods play an important role in the precise staging as basic requirement for an effective concept of tumor therapy.	0.9134737858378962
The accuracy of ultrasound in the primary staging according to the TNM-classification (UICC) was therefore prospectively investigated in 260 patients with head and neck tumors of the clinical stages T1N0 to T4N3.	1.1648109916419849
The clinically (C1) and sonographically (C2) evaluated pretherapeutic stages were compared to the postoperative histopathologic tumor classifications.	1.057798331978777
The clinical staging was correct in 75.0 %, high in 7.7 %, low in 17.3 %, the N-stages were correct in 59.2 %, high in 17.7 %, low in 23.1 %.	1.288550176669516
The sonographic staging was apparently superior with the T-classifications correct in 92.3 %, high in 7.7 %, low 0.0 %.	1.1339576816446584
The N-stages were correct in 89.6 %, high in 9.2 %, low in 1.2 %.	1.1914347506894563
The accuracy of combined TN classification rose from clinical 46.5 % to 84.6 % by sonography.	1.2198968738259568
Accompanying inflammations, foregoing biopsies and tooth extractions were the main reasons for incorrect staging.	0.8449468525322416
Therefore, the thorough sonographic investigation performed after the clinical examination and before invasive procedures, due to little patient discomfort, good availability and high accuracy, is an excellent sectional imaging method for staging, therapy-planning and follow up of tumors of the head and neck especially of the orofacial regions.	1.179467887752515
Standardized guidelines for exercise training for patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) have not been established.	1.0088979165816665
In the past CHF patients involved in exercise training studies demonstrated a wide range of cardiac and functional impairment, with an ejection fraction between 18 and 35% and a peak VO2 between 12.2 and 25.4 ml/kg/min on average.	1.2798899907225636
For determination of training intensity, a VO2 between 40 and 70% of peak VO2 and/or training heart rate between 60 and 80% of peak heart rate was used.	1.1912703844719423
There was also a wide range for frequency (between 3 and 7 times per week) and duration of training (between 20 and 60 min per session).	1.1551550555277788
For aerobic exercise training only continuous training methods were applied.	0.7334248976959393
We have developed a new interval training method which allows intense exercise stimuli on peripheral muscles with minimal cardiac strain.	0.8676823304700014
After only three weeks of training, the improvement in aerobic capacity was similar to that reported after longer training periods using continuous methods.	1.0235250321928466
To determine work rate for work phases of interval training, a special steep ramp test was developed.	0.8842102668258034
By analysis of acute physical responses to this testing procedure and to the interval training, both were proven to be tolerable in CHF patients, even if their ejection fraction is as low as 13%, or peak cardiac index not greater than 1.6 l/m2/min, and peak VO2 less than 8.5 ml/kg/min.	1.277022483089693
Therapeutic choice in laryngeal carcinoma is influenced by the nature of the tumor and a variety of factors involving the patient and physician.	1.0132965741882363
Small (T1) and exophytic (T1, T2) tumors are suitable for radiotherapy.	0.88046122604092
Limited lesions (T1, T2) can be cured by functional endoscopic resection techniques or external partial laryngectomies.	0.8181034691975835
Extensive tumors (large T2; T3) are treated by total laryngectomy or by primary irradiation, especially in the case of a good response to induction chemotherapy.	1.0708604721939006
When radiation treatment fails, surgery succeeds in more than half of the cases.	0.8225432381314025
Tumors infiltrating or transgressing the laryngeal framework (T4) can only be cured by total laryngectomy followed by radiotherapy.	0.910088959816787
Subtotal or circular ablation of the adjacent pharynx or esophagectomy needs repair with visceral or myocutaneous grafts.	0.846896013463487
Lymphatics are preferentially treated with the same modality as used in the primary disease.	1.2315445471131479
Inconspicuous lymphatics should be treated electively in most cases, with the exception of early glottic cancer.	1.0825768613859317
Induced hypotension is defined as a reduction in mean arterial blood pressure to 50-60 mm Hg in normotensive subjects.	1.065967778343206
The aim of induced hypotension is to decrease intraoperative blood loss, decrease the need for blood transfusions and improve operating conditions.	1.2180341243032982
Most studies indicate that induced hypotension can decrease intraoperative blood loss by 50% in many surgical procedures; however, some studies report that blood loss is not significantly reduced.	1.218914970149845
Current methods of induced hypotension are based on the use of rapid and short-acting vasodilators as primary agents (nitroprusside, nitroglycerine, urapidil), supplemented by volatile anesthetics (isoflurane) and/or -blockers (esmolol) to improve effect, reduce dosage and prevent side effects (reflex tachycardia, tachyphylaxis, rebound hypertension).	1.0923850535294766
Proper positioning of the patient and controlled ventilation aid in reducing blood loss.	1.1100341104193103
Major risks of induced hypotension are a reduction in blood flow (i.e.	0.9422030875267671
ischaemia) of vital organs (brain, myocardium) and elevation of intracranial pressure in neurosurgical patients.	1.1418928862816728
Thus, major contraindications of induced hypotension are severe coronary artery disease, hypertension combined with arteriosclerosis of cerebral vessels and increased intracranial pressure in patients with cerebral disease.	1.1886115616183033
Complications are rare in otherwise healthy patients, but may be higher in elderly patients and those with underlying organ dysfunction.	1.1822172304945535
Therefore, careful assessment and selection of patients, together with consideration of the potential complications, appropriate choice of drugs and invasive beatby-beat monitoring, are essential for the safe practice of induced hypotension.	1.1499607656278867
Abstract  Empirical results stemming from infant research have contributed extensively to the understanding of coping with psychosocial stress and vulnerability for psychosomatic symptoms in later life.	0.8212291166754008
The interaction and the emotional exchange between caregiver and child in the first months of life lead to representations of interactions that will be the base for the quality of attachment.	1.0285115214177807
The mutual regulation of the caregiver-infant-pair enables the child to acquire a psychic capacity to regulate physiological requirements.	0.8594606209724149
This selfregulatory function determines the potential of the later adult to react to distress - in a symbolic way using words or more in a somatic way by developing psychosomatic symptoms.	1.138767807780498
First experiences with the treatment of psychosomatic patients with respect to the new findings about self-regulation are reported.	1.1507341233238724
A 31-year-old pregnant woman had to undergo emergency abdominal surgery due to acute intestinal obstruction.	0.9439632734450176
The patient's preoperative history demonstrated multiple allergies as well as abdominal trauma several years before.	1.06312877430321
The physical examination - including sonography of the two fetuses - showed no pathological signs.	1.406657232040353
Anaesthesia was induced intravenously with the operating table tilted to the left side, using routine precautions pre-oxygenation, and rapid sequence intubation, and was maintained unproblematically.	1.2886948620799212
About 20 min after the onset of surgery, hypotension, tachycardia, and a drop in oxygen saturation appeared.	1.0894010522088142
Volume substitution and the application of vasoactive drugs failed to stabilise the haemodynamic situation.	0.8012757537246775
Elevation of the pregnant uterus and increased left tilzing of the operating table did not lead to improvement.	0.8901994924774668
The development of eyelid edema led to the diagnosis of an anaphylactic reaction.	1.0274394567755836
The patient was treated successfully with epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids (prednisolone).	0.9695784635799545
The suspicion of latex-related allergy was verified postoperatively by radio-allergen-sorbent test (RAST) and prick and scratch tests.	0.862602277090738
The mean arterial blood pressure is decreased during the first two trimesters of pregnancy and increases to preconceptional values during the last weeks of gestation.	1.1271228524011767
The heart rate increases during the whole course of pregnancy.	0.6487508427560903
During late gestation fewer patients show an increase in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate in the standing position.	0.7303311056009192
A fall in heart rate was only seen in this period.	1.0351863328122224
A fall in mean arterial blood pressure during standing is not related to the blood pressure in the supine position during the whole course of pregnancy.	0.840596411618373
The hypotensive symptoms are twice as frequent during early pregnancy compared to late pregnancy.	0.803208300127027
Headaches, fatigue and cold extremities are the most usual complaints.	1.0193299810061573
The frequency and intensity of these three symptoms decrease during gestation.	0.9561515686635582
Blood pressure in the supine position is reduced in symptomatic pregnant women.	0.7798160637993199
However, the occurrence of these symptoms is not correlated to the fall in blood pressure in the standing position.	1.0035090639738664
The Birth-weight is not influenced by blood pressure in the supine position, but depends on the fall in blood pressure during standing.	0.953978845388736
Pregnant women with a more pronounced fall in blood pressure give birth to newborns with a lower birthweight.	1.0297171956624218
These results imply a hitherto unknown cause of intrauterine growth restriction.	0.7570771656596449
The combination of saltwater baths and subsequent ultraviolet irradiation is an effective treatment for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.	0.9009071167927026
The aim of the present study was to determine the photosensitizing properties of two commercially available bath salts, original salt from the Dead Sea and sodium chloride.	0.8607381762206124
To address this issue, test areas on the volar aspects of the forearms were soaked with salt solutions for 15 minutes prior to ultraviolet-B (UVB) irradiation.	0.8599515479098411
The salt concentrations tested were 1%, 3% 5% and 15%.	1.5556827783070593
Tap water followed by UVB and UVB alone served as controls.	0.6550364823639546
Erythema was determined by visual and photometric measurement, and delayed tanning was assessed by colorimetry.	1.0074443133968214
Erythema obtained by wetting the skin prior to UVB irradiation was more pronounced than erythema induced by UVB alone.	0.8548964608048173
The most prominent erythema was yielded by tap water+UVB.	0.8239435915429827
The salts had a differing photosensitizing capacity and the strongest erythema was produced by the 5% solutions.	1.0005588170804198
There was only a moderate influence on delayed tanning by bathing the skin prior to irradiation.	0.8543284362099662
The results from the present study indicate that soaking the skin with salt solutions or tap water increases skin sensitivity to subsequent UVB irradiation.	1.0334878386758424
This may contribute to the effectiveness of salt water baths followed by UV irradiation and may account for an increased sunburn risk after bathing.	0.8112352928987306
Introduction: The aim of the study was to evaluate the modern principles of surgery in diverticulitis, e. g. early elective resection and primary anastomosis.	0.9809885896192417
Methods: The data of 445 consecutive patients were retrospectively analysed after classifying all cases in four subgroups according to a modified Hinchey classification (stages 0-III).	1.0557681834508426
Results: Within our study group the morbidity was 26.5 % (n = 118) and the mortality was 1.6 % (n = 7).	1.4717669289055162
In 96 % (n = 425) of all cases and in 64 % (21/33) of patients with perforated diverticulitis and peritonitis (stage III), a primary anastomosis was performed.	1.533243039762048
Four patients of the study group showed insufficient anastomosis (0.9 %).	1.1122021077390567
No leakage was observed from any of the anastomoses performed in stage III diverticulitis.	0.9543401434539346
Stage of inflammation and age of patient correlate with morbidity and mortality.	0.8781080170326689
Some 53 % (94/177) of the patients in stage II and 67 % (22/33) of the patients in stage III had never showed symptoms of diverticulitis before.	1.385675605615654
Conclusion: Prophylactic surgery to avoid life-threatening situations, including abscess formation or perforation, is not possible in many cases.	1.51488654357815
However, especially patients at risk (age, coexisting illness) should undergo early surgery.	1.389329640978069
Primary anastomosis can be performed safely even at an advanced stage.	0.8689429430396199
To evaluate whether MRI is usefull in staging renal cell carcinomas with caval thrombus the accuracy of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in staging renal tumors with caval thrombus were preoperatively examined.	0.8863042847413681
Tumor staging by CT and MR imaging were correlated with histopathological tumor stadium.	0.9003879416454605
In MRI 4 out of 7 thrombi were correctly diagnosed with high accuracy, in CT none.	1.0175323322355976
In advanced renal carcinoma MRI with Gadolinium was superior to CT imaging, especially in diagnosing tumor thrombus.	1.0390853478644337
Consequently the extent of tumor thrombus may be assessed by MRI which therefore may replace conventional cavography.	0.9849650991587381
Children of mothers chronically infected with hepatitis-C-virus (HCV) during pregnancy and delivery were prospectively followed.	1.0011563738013745
90 children born to 85 infected mothers were included in our study; nine of the mothers were known to be co-infected with HIV-1.	1.1828561600581557
These 90 children were first tested within 60 days after birth and followed for at least three months.	0.9712709455501538
Three of the 90 children became infected perinatally with HCV as shown by persistence of antibodies after 2 years of life and a positive result in the RT-PCR.	1.117877693098893
One of these 3 children has evidence of ongoing hepatitis as shown by slightly elevated alanine aminotransferase values, but is otherwise clinically well, likewise the other 2 infected children.	1.0621366142663204
54 of the 87 uninfected children were followed until they lost maternal antibodies after an average of one year.	0.8922065847995121
Cor triatriatum dexter is a rare congenital malformation in which a membrane divides the right atrium into two chambers.	1.1320926323039997
The membrane represents a persistence of the right sinus venosus valve (RSV).	0.8723950808577625
Normally the RSV regresses between the 9th and 15th week of gestation, as the cephalic portion forms the crista terminalis and the caudal portion develops into the Eustachian and Thebesian valve.	0.9463822674305462
Any failure in the regression process may result in remnants of RSV as a simple muscle bar, a Chiari-network or a fenestrated or unfenestrated membrane (cor triatriatum dexter).	0.9089946235700007
We describe a patient with cor triatriatum dexter in whom diagnosis was made several years after successful valvulotomy procedure for severe congenital valvular pulmonary stenosis.	1.0243191744706963
Apoptosis and proliferation are important regulators of normal development and homeostasis in the bone marrow.	0.9232163973731216
Therefore, dynamics of hematopoiesis is mainly defined by these two parameters.	1.1964548937929889
However, since only few data are available from previous studies, we performed a retrospective analysis to elucidate some aspects of this complex pathomechanism.	1.4065507303712432
A total of 400 patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPDs) and corresponding reactive bone marrow lesions were enrolled into this study.	1.0778797094315942
Apoptosis was detected in bone marrow tissue by the ISEL-technique and topoisomerase II  expression was demonstrated by the monoclonal antibody Ki-S1.	0.9442737708406562
Furthermore, by determination of the proliferating-cell nuclear antigen labeling (PCNA) index, we were able to calculate the proportion of cells in the G2/M phase, because both nuclear antigens are expressed in different phases of the cell cycle.	1.1504027420804595
Patients with IMF, PV, and ET revealed a normal range of apoptosis, whereas in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) a significant increase could be observed.	1.2265377545421965
On the other hand, IMF and PV were characterized by a raised proliferative activity.	0.7741975202394207
Dynamics of hematopoiesis was assessed by calculation of the so called hematopoietic turnover index.	0.8832905111163739
In CML and reactive lesions no alterations of this parameter were detectable, but IMF and PV showed a significant increase.	1.1025708260107228
Survival analysis disclosed a relevant worsening of life expectancy for patients with reduced apoptosis and proliferation.	0.9685038394821008
In conclusion, our in-situ results confirm and extend previous experimental data on hematopoietic cell kinetics.	1.1114208211330836
In this context, a greater regenerative capacity of hematopoiesis may be reflected by an increased rate of apoptosis and/or proliferation and therefore is associated with a more favorable outcome.	1.1334809798698124
In a complex animal model in sheep, polydioxanone (PDS) and polylactic membranes were used for the reconstruction of large orbital-wall defects.	1.022562605831377
In a long-term experiment over 1 year, polylactic implants alone showed the best performance as compared with combinations involving autogenous bone grafts and titanium miniplate fixation.	0.9123167599463222
As soon as these polylactic implants are approved for human surgery, they will be used to solve the still challenging problem of anatomical reconstruction of large comminuted fractures of more than one orbital wall.	1.0912755541853365
Surgery by three-dimensional (3D) endoscopy is being used routinely in abdominal surgery and, in special cases, in thoracic surgery; however, it has not been reported as being used in microlaryngeal surgery.	1.1405776871168647
We inserted a 3-D endoscope into a jet laryngoscope and studied the pressure properties at the tip of the laryngoscope as well as intrapulmonary pressures while applying superimposed high-frequency jet ventilation.	0.9569722691262523
The studies were conducted initially using a lung simulator, and then in seven patients undergoing microlaryngeal surgery.	1.0483199469979323
Due to the rather large 3-D endoscope, the diameter of the jet laryngoscope was reduced by between 25.2% and 70.9%, depending on its size.	1.353317021063371
The measurements on the lung simulator revealed that reduction of laryngoscope diameter leads to an increase in the following parameters: expiratory resistance, tidal volume, and peak inspiratory pressure.	1.0661783768149158
The mean FiO2 was 0.74 +/- 0.1; the mean paO2 was 169.2 +/- 80.4 mm Hg; and the mean paCO2 was 40.9 +/- 2.4 mm Hg.	1.1953378273608983
The mean airway pressure was 19 +/- 5.3 mm Hg prior to insertion of the endoscope and 12.3 +/- 6.9 mm Hg after insertion.	1.0669317224100439
The mean positive end-expiratory pressure values increased from 2 +/- 0.6 to 3.6 +/- 2.3 mm Hg.	1.1888676475725113
Reduction of the working pressure resulted in restoration of the initial inspiratory pressures and tidal volumes.	0.9459728192822919
In the clinical application of 3-D endoscopy via a jet laryngoscope, it was possible to achieve sufficient ventilation, inspection of the surgical field, and performance of the surgical procedure.	1.222029683827813
A CO2 laser was used without changing the ventilation regime.	0.8051357217464492
Although technical alterations would be desirable for its application to microlaryngeal surgery, it is presently possible to safely use the 3-D endoscope via the jet laryngoscope for microlaryngeal surgery, presenting the surgeon with new possibilities in voice-improving microsurgery of the larynx.	1.0643774968183641
Kryopreserved specimens of cystic ducts were used for displacement tests to investigate the security of different laparoscopic clips.	0.9311890547746139
The cystic duct was fixed, and the transverse placed clips were distracted in axial direction and the forces registered.	1.0731768223944533
The median values of the six investigated clips ranged between 4.1 N and 11.2 N with a highly significant difference (P < 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA).	0.954182471173123
In detail, both resorbable clips (polydioxanone, polyglyconate/polyglycol acetate) were superior to the four titanium clips (P < 0.005, Wilcoxon test).	1.0362537663853577
In addition to the advantage of complete biodegradibility, these data favour the use of absorbable clips because holding force is better than that of titanium clips.	1.057695918611242
Hemoglobin solutions and fluorocarbon emulsions are evaluated as artificial oxygen carriers.	0.7072340044854873
The efficacy of hemoglobin solutions with respect to O2 transport and especially the effective O2 release to tissues has been demonstrated in a number of situations, such as extreme hemodilution and hemorrhagic shock.	1.0075829018986795
The hemoglobin molecule could be stabilized by genetic and chemical modifications.	0.774596709017915
This results in a clinically utilizable intravascular half-life of about 8-24 h, an adequate O2 affinity, and a lack of nephrotoxicity.	1.3297323058905266
A degree of vasoconstriction must be mentioned as the persistent side effect of the hemoglobin solutions evaluated here.	0.9113627130387272
In spite of this, hemoglobin solutions are also well tolerated in humans.	1.0229306097344373
Fluorocarbon emulsions are compounds with a very high gas solubility and are, therefore, well suited for the transport of O2 and CO2.	1.0169854498944433
The capacity for the release of O2 to the tissues is especially excellent.	0.8865821638414284
This was demonstrated under extreme hemodilution, during extracorporeal circulation and also under reanimation.	0.9410906584575134
Perflubron, the most important representative of the fluorocarbon emulsions, has also been successfully used in man and is well tolerated.	1.2537595222648112
The introduction of artificial oxygen carriers to clinical practice will greatly change transfusion medicine and also the acute care of trauma patients.	0.9631019285063226
Launch is expected within the next few years.	0.6177743326020059
The new volatile anaesthetic desflurane is characterized by very low blood-gas and tissue-blood partition coefficients, so that rapid induction of anaesthesia and shorter recovery times can be expected.	1.051695967791516
The aim of this investigation was to compare the effects of desflurane and isoflurane on haemodynamics and recovery time when used as part of a balanced anaesthesia technique for elective surgery.	1.013919161503496
In acute coronary syndromes, arteriosclerotic plaques are characterized by inflammation and decreased smooth muscle cell density.	0.8608140017095557
The underlying pathogenic processes remain unclear.	0.5474777199575216
Among others, increased programmed cell death (apoptosis) is postulated.	1.04742813872029
Coronary atherectomy specimens from 26 patients with unstable angina (group 1) and from 24 patients with stable angina (group 2) were examined, using immunohistochemistry (TUNEL test to detect fragmented DNA) and transmission electron microscopy.	1.200185260678878
The objectives of the present study were to evaluate plaque group differences in the cellular composition, to detect and quantify cell death, and to diferentiate between apoptosis and necrosis.	1.2567347827901518
On occasion of the 100th anniversary of heart surgery we present in this article the first successful experimental open heart operations in Russia in the years from 1926 to 1937.	1.0985715877491375
These operations on the stationary heart were carried out by using the first device for extracorporeal circulation.	0.9518611692517839
This work pioneered by Russian scientist S. Brukhonenko and the Surgeon N. Terebinski is nearly unknown to the medical public.	0.9620293107844222
The first and largest series at the time worldwide of more than 260 operations on the valves of the open heart, the still valid prophylactic procedure to avoid air embolism, and principles of open heart surgery stated by N. Terebinski were decades ahead of the development at the time.	1.137889304039784
In the authors' opinion they represent a milestone in the history of open heart surgery.	0.7652214666806598
Aneurysms of the temporal part of the carotid artery are unusually rare.	0.9912138738777737
The literature contains only a few previous reports dealing with hemorrhage from such malformations.	0.8879392945949998
In the present case massive bleeding occurred from a right-sided intrapetrous aneurym after myringotomy, which was performed as treatment for bilateral secretory otitis media.	1.2129344326945282
Due to the absence of any specific symptoms and the masking effect of middle ear glue preoperative identification of the aneurysm was not possible.	1.1793874139228626
Subsequent angiography showed the large fusiform extension of the intrapetrous aneurysm as well as multiple intracranial aneurysms.	0.8822704685107255
Leakage from the aneurism was closed definitively with muscle, fascia lata and a gelatin-resorcin-formalin-glue (Cardial).	0.7898195546218725
In order to apply the tissue patch the hypotympanic site of the aneurism was exposed using a posterior otosurgical approach.	0.895977528464157
Due to extensive intracranial collateralization to the vertebral arteries bleeding persisted even after ligation of both carotid arteries.	0.826246556394649
Temporary cardiac asystole was then induced to allow safe closure of the aneurysm.	0.7713189075663711
Following surgery the patient sustained loss of hearing in her ear and a partial peripheral facial palsy.	0.9449677954863669
Blindness causes human suffering and high social costs.	0.7210934005797797
Virtually all blind people are registered with the social services.	0.8389461607514274
Data from these institutions may help in (long-term) planning for blindness prevention.	1.033959152331301
The stage-oriented treatment of stem varicosis is the operation method of choice.	0.936138784068106
Nowadays, partial stem varicosis, which is an earlier stage of the disease, leads to operative treatment more frequently than 10 years ago; thus a sufficient vein stump remains after surgical treatment.	1.1851001979546587
After surgery on a group of 1000 patients, we examined the stumps for patency, the occurrence of varicose changes, for their availability in the long term, and the sufficiency of their length for aortocoronary or peripheral bypass surgery.	1.2319705925285054
The treatment of insufficient perforant veins was also included in the surgical therapy, as well as postoperative sclerotherapy of remaining lateral veins.	1.0143423558770275
With a follow-up period of up to 33 months postoperatively, the results show a high patency rate in the remaining stumps (97%), as well as a high sufficiency rate (94%), with a mean graft length of 29.4 cm.	1.271592515924543
Thus these stumps constitute a good natural graft for future vascular reconstructions.	0.7596398238784485
This study supports the call for the stage-oriented surgical treatment of stem varicosis.	0.9287027077812916
Background: Corneal HLA-DR antigens are going to be lost during organ culture storage.	1.1450009154208052
This study investigated if this phenomenon is based on down-regulation of the HLA-DR antigen, or on a loss of the HLA-DR-positive corneal Langerhans cells (LCs).	0.9066719178516957
The authors present a rare case of solitary non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in the skull of an 11-year-old girl.	1.1354754358916501
The clinical, radiological and histological findings as well as a review of the literature are included in this report.	1.2098452176579795
The morphological features of intra- and extracerebral tumor masses and the change in tumor extension due to chemotherapy and radiation therapy were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging.	1.0668917933373943
Although rare, NHL should be considered in the differential diagnosis of skull tumors in children.	0.8067377153570825
Neurodegenerative and dementing disorders such as Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease are among the most common diseases of advanced age.	0.896132770403317
Despite progress in the clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders, definite diagnosis for most of these disorders is still possible only by neuropathological examination of the brain.	1.1798889185195387
The neuropathological diagnosis and classification of neurodegenerative disorders has made clear advances in recent years, particularly due to the results of genetic and biochemical studies, resulting in the development of new disease-specific antibodies.	1.1394557805419223
Internationally recognized consensus criteria for most neurodegenerative disorders allow a definite and standardized diagnosis to be made.	0.793962096348946
To obtain further knowledge about the etiopathogenesis, particularly with regard to new therapeutic strategies, studies with clinically and neuropathologically well-documented cases are needed.	1.1504901545693231
The project "Brain-Net" has therefore been established with the aim of setting up a German Brain and Tissue Bank for Diseases of the Central Nervous System.	1.0065267778725404
The project is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research.	0.7908157810674761
Fetal surgery is defined as the intrauterine surgical correction of malformations that endanger the unborn child's life in prenatal stages of development or lead to death or severe damage of the child postnatally.	0.9941388363414859
Such surgery is a clinical reality now.	0.9566890434843929
Indications for intrataurine surgical procedures also exist for head and neck abnormalities, especially in the upper respiratory tract.	0.9940654269231081
These include exposure and temporary obstruction of the fetal trachea for correction of pulmonary hypoplasia in cases with congenital diaphragmatic hernias, prenatal tracheotomy in cases of laryngeal atresia for the correction of lethal pulmonary overdistension, and resection of embryonic tumors that obstruct the respiratory tract.	1.0129410096838931
The relatively high surgical risk resulting in particular from preterm labor occurring postoperatively may be reduced by employing minimally invasive techniques.	0.887445877803016
Endoscopic procedures render opening of the uterus unnecessary and are of particular importance.	0.8260828838884234
In part of the procedures, only endoscopic surgery has led to therapeutic success rates justifying its clinical use.	0.9471544353104513
Further reduction of the operative risk suggests prenatal interventions, even in cases with non-lethal conditions.	1.0917963168662899
More diseases of the head and neck may thus be included in the spectrum of indications.	0.864175176885817
One example is prenatal correction of a cleft lip and palate, which until now has only been performed in animal experiments.	1.1117307231581524
The particular characteristics of fetal wound healing allow this to take place without scarring up to a certain stage in pregnancy.	0.9687891088996889
This offers the prospect of a surgical correction that is invisible externally and avoids growth-impeding scars.	0.8435870248064403
The particular ethical and legal aspects of fetal surgery are discussed.	0.7606793395308747
We report on a 57-year-old patient suffering from a complex malposition of proximal femur after osteosynthesis using a condylar plate.	1.0347216758204711
For polyaxial correction of the proximal femur we successfully used an intramedullary hip screw system.	1.0180676644445994
In 6 patients with primary malignant bone tumors (4 Ewing, 1 recurrent Adamantinoma, 1 maligne Haemangioperizytoma) the local therapy was performed as intraoperative extracorporeal irradiation and replantation.	1.2445431479400955
During the follow-up 10 (6-24) months no local recurrence in the replanted segment occurred.	1.0921944231077452
One recurrence occurred in the host bed; in two cases the replanted segment had to be removed because of severe infection.	1.194938725747506
The other cases showed good functional and radiological results.	0.9093122713457955
These clinical findings and the reports in the literature seem to allow the application of the intraoperative extracorporeal irradiation and replantation procedure for defect reconstruction in cases of chemo- and radiotherapy-sensitive bone tumors.	1.114423273312127
Effects of anaesthesia and analgesia on postoperative morbidity and mortality remain controversial.	0.858423753402882
Numerous studies have demonstrated that epidural anaesthesia and pain relief by epidural analgesia reduces perioperative stress responses and thus may reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality.	1.0290287553529447
In patients undergoing vascular surgery, epidural anaesthesia diminished postoperative hypercoagulability.	0.8964512691942486
These patients may benefit from less thromboembolic complications as well as a reduced risk of a re-operation.	1.09662880151084
However, regional anaesthesia does not affect cardiopulmonary morbidity or overall mortality significantly in most clinical studies.	1.1460679066672146
One reason for this disappointing finding may be the missing integration of improved postoperative pain relief into general surgical care.	0.946592981425339
A multimodal therapeutic approach, which consists of preoperativ patient information, sufficient analgesia, early mobilisation and enteral feeding, may solve this discrepancy.	1.0619516179945403
Therefore, prospective controlled studies are needed to assess the influence of this perioperative approach on outcome.	1.2171075830986064
Although cerebrovascular diseases are the most common causes of dementia after Alzheimer's desease, vascular dementia (VD) has remained so far an ill-defined term.	1.1125016896918432
The main problems in the definition of VD arise from finding criteria for both terms "vascular" and "dementia".	0.9513717894077688
The detailed criteria for the diagnosis of VD proposed by several groups or institutions (ADDTC, DSM-IV, ICD-10, NINDS-ARIEN) are critically reviewed.	0.9587982377524136
The diagnostic value of some clinical findings, especially the very frequent white matter luciencies in CT (leuko-araiosis), are discussed.	1.1321231493279813
The available studies suggest a differentiation of VD into some subtypes (listed according to frequency): subcortical VD, VD with acute onset, multiinfarct-dementia, mixed types, and specific forms.	0.9648905696015944
Nevertheless, these subtypes give only little information about the etiology of the underlying vascular process and, therefore, no clear indication for specific therapeutic strategies.	1.3526344953479728
The aetiology of varicosis is still unclear.	0.5772895024575349
Investigation of changes in normal veins which result in the formation of varicosis led to examination of elastic properties and histomorphological alterations in the region of the extracellular matrix in the vessel wall of the long saphenous vein in normal and varicose veins.	1.0211099508556634
The rigidity of varicose veins was higher than that of normal veins; there was no difference between the varicose vein above a competent valve and the "normal" vein below this competent valve.	0.966951051429149
The matrix proteins demonstrated an increase in total fibres, whereas the elastic fibres were reduced and fragmented, explained the rigidity of varices.	1.0966650183391204
These results suggest that the role of the venous valves in the development of varicose veins is secondary to changes of the vein wall.	1.0539700355005994
An investigation of 122 knee joints was performed concerning the incidence and morphological characteristics of the meniscofemoral ligaments (MFL) Humphry and Wrisberg.	0.9604944756208057
Of the knees examined, 96% showed one or more ligaments, the incidence was independent of gender or age.	1.2097221440139112
The osseous parameters of the dorsal and ventral notch as well as the diacondylar width did not correlate with the incidence of MFL.	1.0707738432721
The ventral notch width index (NWI) after Souryal was 0.22 in females and 0.24 in males.	0.9175820832904722
A dorsal notch width index (dNWI), which has not been described so far, was 0.26 in females and 0.28 in males.	1.1566438087392108
The ligamentum meniscofemorale posterius (Wrisberg) showed distinct morphological variations.	0.8934964433817162
This resulted in a classification of type I-III.	1.0150922591845115
The results of the study underline the importance of the MFL for knee joint function including stabilization, proprioception, and meniscal positioning.	1.1315995651629642
Eleven patients with high-grade mucosal dysplasia in a columnar-lined oesophagus and 2 patients with a squamous carcinoma (uT1) underwent photodynamic therapy (PDT) and argon-plasma coagulation (APC).	1.1879680229544403
For PDT, 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) was given orally (60 mg/kg) and treated endoscopically with a light dose of 150 J/cm2 (100 mW/cm2) at 635 nm 4-6 h later.	1.2991011441606348
A second PDT was performed under the same conditions 2-3 weeks later.	1.0177939303527892
Patients who received APC were treated 4 times on average to reach radical Barrett mucosa eradication.	0.9097665580327825
All patients were consistently given medication to suppress acid production.	0.928774317637426
No complications occurred in either group.	0.32744016273516596
Follow-up endoscopies and multiple biopsies for 3-42 months showed squamous regeneration in the dysplastic columnar-lined oesophagus in all 11 patients.	0.986459810487558
Two patients with squamous carcinoma were found to have a recurrence 9 and 12 months later.	1.1954266219593241
PDT with 5-ALA-induced endogenous porphyrins, as well as APC combined with omeprazole protection, can eradicate superficial high-grade dysplastic mucosa in Barrett's oesophagus.	0.986061174776947
However, we did not succeed in destroying a manifest carcinoma.	1.2886594407566678
Technical advantages of spiral technology are of great usefulness in diagnostic imaging of thorax and abdomen in children.	0.9353658921991171
The rapid imaging time allows the examination of an entire organ while scanning with breath holding or while the child is quietly breathing, resulting in a decreased need for sedation.	0.9402111841625473
In addition especially examinations of the chest an to some extend CT-investigations of the abdomen are performed with reduced radiation dose achieved by reducing the tube loading.	1.0718648429755324
Radiation dose reduction of 70% is possible without loss of relevant diagnostic information.	1.0869060055429012
Spiral low-dose CT in pediatric chest imaging is useful in evaluating parenchymal lung diseases, mediastinal masses and central airway malformations.	0.9599674344237323
Whether abdominal helical CT can be replaced by MRI has to be decided in each individual case.	0.7731932701597445
When an exact protocol is used, sufficient contrast material given, scan-delay optimized and postprocessing reconstructions are performed, usefull additional diagnostic informations are obtained by the method.	0.9704003905162133
Invasive monitoring is a standard procedure in modern intensive care medicine.	1.1039016753960829
Despite significant progress in the routine use and catheter technology, there are relevant remaining risks concerning acute central venous and arterial access and chronic persistence of catheters within the vascular lumen.	1.0921347762814815
Resulting from the infectiologically established novel definition of antiseptic which contains the local application of antiseptics for prophylactical, preventive or therapeutical indication on skin, mucous membrane, wounds, in body cavities or on surgical exposed resp.	0.9525182344360055
opened endosomatic areas the antiseptical indications in a branch of dermatology and venereal diseases are represented.	0.8195538139977482
With the analysis of the actual knowledge in vitro and in vivo requirements to local antiinfectiva are defined combined with the recommendations for the clinical use.	1.1687686226636982
At present mainly prophylactically used agents are submitted to a benefit risk analysis with refer to the choice of agents.	0.8279542728249337
Thereby agents for the application on skin as well as on genitals, in mouth cavity and on wounds were taken into consideration.	1.1645964013635253
Hydatid disease, still frequent in endemic areas, is usually localized in the liver.	1.0940274429286014
Despite the benign nature of the disease it is one of the problematic fields of surgery due to the high complication rate and long hospital stay.	1.1712505616138262
Based on our experience we recommend evacuation of the cyst and omentoplasty as the surgical method of choice, as it is associated with a relatively low incidence of complications and can be performed easily.	1.2439146272482358
Background: Central catheters in neonatological intensive care patients are used for the prolonged application of medicataion or parenteral infusions.	1.235476938919836
Dislocations and septic and thromboembolic complications may occur.	0.6410359330539357
Low density lipoproteins are heterogeneous in particle size, density, and physical as well as chemical properties.	0.9141378083899935
Regarding size and density, LDL can be divided into two main profiles, LDL pattern A with elevated concentration of large, buoyant LDL particles and LDL pattern B with increased concentration of small, dense LDL particles.	0.9017368560262544
The latter is particularly expressed in insulin resistance and is associated with elevated serum triglycerides and reduced concentrations of HDL and particularly HDL2 cholesterol.	0.9225344995898591
The LDL profile of increased concentration of small, dense LDL particles has shown to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events.	0.8177904970902886
The LDL profile is partly genetically determined, but can be improved by non-pharmacological (exercise, diet) and pharmacological intervention.	1.1293770046891354
It remains to be confirmed whether the LDL subfraction profile is an independent lipid risk factor besides HDL2 cholesterol and triglycerides, but it is certainly a valuable indicator assessing metabolic cardiovascular risk.	1.0283145532176878
Traumatic injuries of arteries lead to acute bleeding or ischemia.	0.8192587501423642
In the hand, which is perfused by two arteries, this symptom could be missed.	1.414130974300728
The hypothenar hammer syndrome is a traumatic occlusion of the distal arteria ulnaris.	1.0314525508549728
Dependent on the mechanism of the trauma the clinical symptoms may appear late.	1.217717153434922
A specific angiographic or duplex sonographic diagnostic investigation is necessary to show the arterial occlusion.	0.9898065788639753
There is no proven therapeutic procedure.	0.844941927233976
Exact diagnosis of the occlusion as an effect of the trauma is important for the patient and is the basis of any therapeutic intervention.	1.407007234602826
The administration of epidural opioids is alternatively used in the management of postoperative analgesia.	0.9634425060542199
However, the administration is associated with side effects, including respiratory depression, somnolence and pruritus.	1.101345144384534
A rational opioid selection between the hydrophilic and lipophilic opioids morphine, hydromorphone, alfentanil, fentanyl and sufentanil is discussed in this mini-review.	0.9708370990317744
Thus, the administration of the lipophilic opioid sufentanil might has some advantages.	0.9727218779480814
Notwithstanding, epidural opioid administration alone offers no marked clinical advantages compared to the intravenous route.	0.911473739776332
In future, reduced doses of lipophilic opioids and local anaesthetics like bupivacaine 0.05-0.1% may provide benefits over the use of either drug alone and may offer marked clinical advantages over the intravenous route of opioids alone.	1.111920550984225
The same holds true for  2-adrenoceptor agonists as adjuvants.	0.8998282143129425
However, multicenter dose-ranging studies are necessary to determine both the ideal concentrations of the drug combinations and the general outcome.	1.2742883108732233
Moreover, we must also determine cost effectiveness for our postoperative analgesic techniques.	1.2384009932409161
Today the relevance of renal tumor embolization is not determined only by the technical and clinical success of the method.	1.0583072191459384
Progress in diagnosis of early stages of renal carcinomas as well as the improvement of both surgical techniques and anesthetic procedures have lead to a change in the selection of patients for embolization.	1.2075030128922166
Preoperative embolization of advanced renal cell carcinomas with tumor thrombus into the vena cava or of T4 tumors is now an established clinical procedure.	0.9185296241557748
The complete occlusion of the vascular bed of the tumors leads to a considerable reduction in intraoperative blood loss and to simplification of the surgical preparation.	1.1894454740839318
By using Ethibloc for embolization, palliation of a hemorrhage or of tumor-related pain in inoperable patients is usually successful.	0.9942051344118229
Although local control of the tumor disease, including complete tumor ablation, is achieved by embolization, the median survival rate of our palliatively embolized patients is only 3.5 months.	1.4226314281720063
This short life expectancy in the group of inoperable patients has to be acknowledged individually in patients considered for palliative embolization who are free of symptoms related to the tumor.	1.047477319972831
Purpose: To evaluate whether primary stenting is superior to balloon angioplasty (PTA) alone in the treatment of femoropopliteal obstructive disease.	1.0323780564087526
Content of this paper is the current state of the art of robots in surgery and the ongoing work on the field of surgical robotics at the Clinic for Maxillofacial Surgery at the Charité.	1.0705370021568699
Robots in surgery allows the surgeon to transform the accuracy of the imaging systems directly during the intervention and to plan an intervention beforehand.	1.0762479671815333
In this paper firstly the state of the art is described.	1.0898945140278438
Subsequently the scientific work at the clinic is described in detail.	0.8458015660765191
The paper closes with a outlook for future applications of robotics systems in maxillofacial surgery.	0.7254247553286284
Giant-cell bone tumors display a locally aggressive growth pattern, frequently recur if no adjuvant treatment is given, and may potentially metastasize.	1.0143866699000486
By virtue of their biological behavior and typically juxta-articular localization, giant-cell bone tumors require specific surgical management.	0.890086425697833
Thus, an intralesional tumor excision must be supplemented by adjuvant bone cementing, possibly combined with instillation of phenol or cryotherapy.	1.0031901455340706
These combined treatment modalities assure a high-quality procedure, defined as the actual way medical care is delivered, by promoting the quality of the outcome, defined as the effect of a medical procedure on the patient's state of health.	1.1584245294024822
We report two patients with partial trisomy of the long arm of chromosome 7 and partial monosomy of the short arm of chromosome 17.	0.9702935257167487
Chromosomal analysis of the family shows a familial balanced translocation of the chromosomes 7 and 17 in the parents and other relatives.	1.0198539927910037
Pedigree analysis reveals abortions, frequent miscarriages and early infant deaths.	0.6908186794952336
Our patients show the same chromosomal abnormality and nearly the same clinical symptoms: prominent forehead, hydrocephalus internus with wide cranial sutures and fontanels, hypertelorism, cleft soft palate, low set dysmorphic ears, psychomotor retardation and micrognathie.	0.9429090152128233
Renal cell carcinomas (RCC) are endowed with impressive metastatic potential.	0.8213760204633389
Patients with RCC who present with apparently solitary metastatic lesions represent a small cohort.	0.7578741557393861
Due to the different long-term results achieved with surgical resection of metastatic RCC lesions, a generally accepted judgement about this treatment modality is not possible.	1.25381136341382
Several studies suggest that aggressive surgical management can provide an effective treatment, especially in patients with solitary pulmonary metastases.	0.9986602460686502
Most noteworthy is the fact that because of the organ distribution of RCC metastases, surgical therapy is dominated by general and thoracic surgeons, neurosurgeons, and orthopaedic surgeons.	1.0813118436509408
Therefore, an interdisciplinary approach is one of the most important key points for a successful outcome in these patients.	1.2646107814802208
The term Langerhans cell histiocytosis, previously "Histiocytosis X", encompasses three different syndromes: eosinophilic granuloma of bone, Hand-Schüller-Christian disease and Abt-Letterer Siwe disease.	0.9626564753847884
All are rare manifestations in childhood.	0.6620567502563681
We report on a 10 year old boy presenting with a swelling in the occipital region and clinical signs of elevated intracranial pressure.	1.0703664278573444
The tentative diagnosis after examination, conventional radiologic procedures and computerized tomography was eosinophilic granuloma.	0.8737240643447847
Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance imaging-angiography revealed the acute threat to the child caused by the intracranial expanding mass lesion with almost complete obstruction of the confluens sinuum.	1.0672773544650294
Thrombosis and the risk of bleeding were decreased by early and complete exstirpation of the tumor.	0.9261596196135449
After two years follow-up, no new lesions had appeared.	1.1376050232561674
The diffuse angiomatosis of the spleen is a rare splenic proliferation.	0.9142350381478828
Spontaneous rupture is the main, potentially lethal complication, found in 25 % of cases.	1.0777040749443394
The problem with these vascular tumors is preoperative diagnosis, because they are asymptomatic for a long time.	0.9949743124512119
First-choice therapy is limited resection.	0.8695773806960716
In the case of rupture, splenectomy is a life-saving procedure.	1.067903152737165
We report on a 56-year-old woman with a spontaneous splenic rupture as the first symptom of diffuse angiomatosis of the spleen.	0.9772668187346168
Exceptional features of splenic hemangiomas, causes of spontaneous rupture and the therapy are described.	0.9666869765332105
The hypothesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as a T cell mediated disease has led to the development of numerous therapeutic approaches that target the function of T cells.	0.9902968782620815
The development of monoclonal antibodies against the T cell surface molecule CD4 has raised hopes to achieve a major progress in the treatment of RA.	1.033560434585493
However, after encouraging results in early open studies, double blind trials were unable to demonstrate the efficacy of anti-CD4-therapy in RA.	1.2139634688055831
There are numerous reasons to explain the failure of this treatment approach.	1.0362315784594023
Besides the fact that the T cell hypothesis of RA has  repeatedly been challenged, pharmacological problems or an inappropriate selection of outcome criteria have to be considered.	0.9603841912113746
The final evaluation of anti-CD4 therapy  in RA will be possible only after  the testing of newly developed  non-depleting anti-CD4 anti- bodies.	1.0440579659456084
Purpose: For some time, the ambulatory diagnosis of respiratory disturbances during sleep has included the use of seven-channel recording units.	1.182194406385285
One of these systems is the POLY-MESAM unit (MAP, Germany).	0.9642252361203937
Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) function as transducers of information across the cell membrane by coupling receptors to effectors.	0.9664112082023587
A large number of G protein-linked receptors funnel extra-cellular signals as diverse as hormones, growth factors, neurotransmitters, and primary sensory stimuli through a set of G proteins to a small number of second-messenger systems.	0.9092017354717256
The G proteins act as molecular switches with an "on" and "off" state governed by a GTPase cycle.	0.9878858019838276
By virtue of its high affinity and specificity for guanine nucleotide binding and its intrinsic GTPase activity, the -subunit of the G protein (G) plays the critical role in regulation of the effectors by their corresponding G protein.	1.1231593603921817
Mutations of G may result in either constitutive activation or loss of expression mutations.	0.7877277383894019
Given the variety of functions subserved by G protein-coupled signal transduction, it is not surprising that abnormalities in G protein-coupled pathways can lead to diseases with manifestations as dissimilar as blindness, hormone resistance, precocious puberty and neoplasia.	0.8828640516514935
For a given defect in a G protein-coupled pathway, the extent of the manifestations will also be determined by the cellular distribution of the affected component.	1.1254745262468786
Defects in components expressed exclusively in a single cell type will cause more a focal disorder than defects in a widely expressed component, particularly in germline mutations (e.g., Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy), whereas somatic mutations of genes encoding even an ubiquitously expressed component can cause focal disease when the somatic mutation itself is focal (e.g., McCune-Albright syndrome).	1.0063896749682495
Mivacurium is a short-acting, nondepolarising muscle relaxant of the benzylisoquinoline type that undergoes rapid breakdown by plasma cholinesterase.	0.8090882407635628
After 2.5 times the ED95 (0.2 mg/kg), tracheal intubation can be accomplished within 2-3 min following injection.	1.2012548809984074
The ensuing DUR 25% (i.e., time from injection to 25% recovery of control twitch tension) is three times as long as with succinylcholine.	1.2214748843828078
The principal side effects of mivacurium are facial flushing and a transient fall in blood pressure due to moderate histamine release following doses 3-4 times the ED95.	0.9976483145845535
In patients with end-stage liver or renal disease as well as those with atypical plasma cholinesterase, the duration of action of mivacurium is prolonged.	1.017009491078387
The performance of new cryoprobes was studied by measuring the spatial and temporal patterns of the temperature distribution in liver tissue around one to three active cryoprobes.	0.9630629118233932
After 15 min of maximal freezing a tissue region 22 mm in diameter was frozen to temperatures below - 50  °C by one active cryoprobe.	0.9304393529258713
With three cryoprobes, using the synergistic cooling effect, a tissue region 45 mm in diameter was cooled to temperatures below - 50  °C.	1.0335935450948326
Optimal placement of the cryoprobes was found to be of critical importance.	1.065883846357774
Attachment representation was assessed in 48 elderly people with an average age of 69 years.	0.9514635782816505
The adult attachment interview was used plus an additional question about wishes for the future.	0.805071473895998
Coherent correlations with subjective life satisfaction and individual future perspective were demonstrated.	0.724022979191282
Elderly participants with secure attachment representation were more satisfied, they were also less anxious, and more often positive about their future.	1.170986119381788
If their adult children had secure attachment representation, they were reported by their elderly parents to be socially, emotionally, and materially more supportive.	1.0517886759147173
Magnetic resonance imaging represents today the most important tool in neuroradiology for both clinical pratice and research.	1.0107582483839002
MRI allows imaging of the human body in 2 or 3 dimensions with variable tissue contrast.	1.092131920285764
The natural diffusion of tissue protons can now be used as a supplementary contrast mechanism.	0.8940463180606755
Different MRI techniques can be used to obtain clinically useful diffusion-weighted images.	0.840104651164414
These techniques all require the use of strong gradient pulses in order to obtain the diffusion contrast.	0.9649781842903261
In the current article, the most important physical principles of diffusion measurement are presented.	1.195949256632594
After a short introduction into the basic physical principles, we will present the prerequisites and limitations of clinically relevant applications today.	1.0910477032454433
Finally a few select examples of clinical use of these techniques in the acute diagnosis of stroke will be presented.	1.1500955563453652
The effects of chronical strains on physical or psychological health are subject of this paper.	0.8782434803076636
Stress-related symptoms of family caregivers of dementia patients have been proven in various studies.	1.0423337666850163
For this group of people an analysis of the health risc factors is regarded as to be especially important.	1.0685437362497971
Diary investigations allow to identify the individual assessment (by the caring person) of factors related to the care situation and to recognize the health and quality of sleep have been used as indicators regarding the state of health.	1.230394330610639
In this study strong differences in the individual view of stress factors and their effects on psychological an physical state of the caring person are shown.	1.1312247435071052
The causes of residual deformity with posttraumatic painful arthritis after tarsometatarsal (Lisfranc) fracture-dislocation with the need for correctional arthrodesis are in our experience (22 cases over 5 years) overseen injuries in one third, closed reduction and immobilisation or inadequate fixation technique with K-wires in another two thirds of cases.	1.097917711425501
Foot malalignment and residual instability is assessed with weight-bearing radiographs of both feet, adduction/abduction stress films and CT scans for complex deformity.	0.9119928736366453
Correction is carried out via two longitudinal dorsal incisions, strict epiperiosteal preparation and debridement of the Lisfranc joint of all remaining cartilage, sclerosis and fibrous tissue.	0.7960952335805959
Reorientation begins, in the same manner as primary open reduction, with anatomical alignment of the second metatarsal base to the second cuneiform.	1.284900236968399
Defects are filled with autologous bone grafting, stable fusion can be achieved with 3.5 mm cancellous compression screws.	1.1282052467135824
Full weight bearing is allowed in a modelled plaster shoe for 6 to 8 weeks.	0.8300701042186736
The functional medium-term results are convincing with 15 of 17 patients seen after 13 months of follow-up working full time.	1.0171324836653024
The Maryland Foot Score improved from 38.9 to 76.8 points in these patients.	0.9541282121222682
The author of this paper deems it very necessary to rename Chinese Tuina, a traditional Chinese medical subject, so as to make Chinese Tuina conform to recent research results and formulation, as well as to combine Chinese Tuina with Western manual medicine at the clinic.	1.0463547502390196
This paper is the result of my research during the period of time was in Switzerland working together with Prof. Jiri Dvorak.	0.9794423157532155
The operability of a liver tumour depends on its three-dimensional relation to the intrahepatic vascular trees which define autonomously functioning liver (sub-)segments.	1.054512474716464
The aim of our study was to establish a computer-based three-dimensional volumetric operation planning system for the liver.	1.1166508690493444
Methods: Using data from routine helical CT scans the three tissue subclasses of liver parenchyma, liver vessels and liver tumour were segmented semiautomatically.	1.1094258302568691
A dedicated segmenting tool was established using region growing algorithms in combination with an "intelligent" border finder.	0.8658769447996107
Visualisation is performed by the "Heidelberg Raytracer".	0.8717865294125579
The vascular trees are visualised as 3D graphs.	0.6906348665740009
Pseudoconnections between portal and hepatic venous trees are separated automatically.	0.7096257671930769
Security margins are calculated and the system presents a virtual resection proposal.	0.8081430014877723
Results: The 3D anatomy of the liver can be visualised in high quality resulting in good depth perception.	1.097542420129032
Dependent liver parenchyma can be recognised automatically on the basis of the vascular trees.	1.115170564915637
The system offers a individualised resection proposal including the tumour, security margin and dependent liver parenchyma.	0.8089544312903229
Conclusion: Three-dimensional presentation of the individual liver anatomy of a given patient facilitates the perception of the pathology.	1.3207856422421813
Virtual reality combined with artifical intelligence allows calculation of complete resection protocols, which can be quantified and modified interactively.	0.8834407330465669
This will make operation planning more objective; patient selection may be improved, and in cases of difficult tumour localisation different resection strategies may be tested.	1.0967578476733733
Thus virtual reality in liver surgery will improve teaching, surgical training and planning.	0.9354245438472522
It may lead to improved surgical care.	0.6117243712594888
Methods to predict the rate of spontaneous relapses in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic agents are missing.	0.9104276917368713
P-wave signal averaging might be helpful in this setting.	0.9310516570525628
However, correct validation and standardization is strongly needed for p-wave analysis with the high resolution ECG.	1.3218320811948903
Signal averaging triggered to the p-wave is significantly superior to QRS-triggering.	0.8604317872325474
Bidirectional filtering or FIR-filtering is necessary.	0.5682110735088686
The data indicate significant differences in p-wave duration between patients with and without paroxysmal artrial fibrillation.	0.893389295948442
Class I antiarrhythmic agents demonstrate a significant prolongation of p-wave duration, but did not influence spectral parameters.	1.0399449457226373
Treatment with sotalol reduces high frequency p-wave energy without altering p-wave duration.	0.8842030825468242
After optimizing the methods, p-wave analysis offers promise to separate patients prone to atrial fibrillation and normals.	1.0844378834617603
In addition, the evaluation of antiarrhythmic efficacy in patients with high risk of recurrent atrial fibrillation might be possible.	1.171314502225105
In the majority of cases right atrial or ventricular thrombi represent pulmonary emboli in transit.	0.8878582807827881
These may be fatal in patients treated conservatively with anticoagulation only.	1.2142141052135609
In literature the incidence of right heart thrombi in patients with proven pulmonary embolism is said to be in the range of 3 - 4%.	1.2215198032655354
Extremely mobile, long, worm-shaped masses in the right heart cavities carry an especially high early thrombus-related mortality rate which ranges from 30 - 40%.	1.0874984516607697
Current therapeutic strategies favour fibrinolytic therapy with consecutive anticoagulation.	0.778901530405461
In the last years, several studies addressed the role of the different antithrombotic therapeutics in unstable angina pectoris.	1.1893905618233052
Acetylsalicylic acid still is the standard treatment reducing the rate of death and myocardial infarction by 50% in the first six months.	1.2383179827223472
Ticlopidin has no clinical effect in the first six days and therefore is not suited for treatment in the acute phase.	1.2244304330953453
Unfractionated heparin has an additional favourable effect when added to aspirin.	0.7152371958795588
Low molecular weight-heparin is at least as effective as UF-heparin.	0.8479808286124159
Direct thrombin-inhibitors (hirudin, hirudin-analoga) seem to be comparable to UF-heparin.	0.7976715709864644
Pasminogen-activators should not be given in unstable angina, as they show a tendency to worsen the clinical outcome.	1.139342317562676
GP IIb/IIIa-antagonists (antibodies, synthetic antagonists) significantly improve the clinical effects of aspirin.	0.9498906642616626
When combined with a reduced dose of heparin, their favourable effect remains unchanged, while bleeding complications are reduced to a minimum.	1.1541332546024246
The study presents data on cardiovascular malformations in Bavarian livebirths, born between 1984 and 1991.	0.8148103809642833
Cases have been ascertained retrospectively by reviewing hospital records of all children being referred to a children's hospital up to 2 years of age.	0.9426088347240392
The classification scheme was based on abnormalities in developmental mechanisms.	0.7803660323231469
Severe dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa with oral involvement often leads to dental destruction and restricted food intake, resulting in malnutrition and maldevelopment.	0.8016922764847304
The patients become handicapped and have a poor prognosis.	0.6484425899976451
We report on a now 13-year-old Turkish child with normal secondary dentition who had severely damaged primary dentition.	1.0855894171826244
The teeth were treated surgically and then by continuous dental hygiene measures over the next 7 years.	0.975955736323675
This care also resulted in an improvement in the nutritional state, associated anemia and the incidence of skin infections.	0.9796910658774656
Although cutaneous blistering and scarring has been progressive, with resulting mutilation of the fingers, the child is socially well adjusted in school and family.	1.0730664080090668
Its clinical course demonstrates that the fate of patients with severe dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa can be improved through multidisciplinary management.	1.0425119052377232
Our understanding of ulcer pathogenesis has dramatically changed since the discovery of Heliobacter pylori.	0.7530108132700529
Peptic ulcer is now recognized as a chronic gastric infectious disease.	0.8024680121128088
H. pylori can be considered the pacemaker, with other known risk factors ultimately contributing to the ulcer formation.	1.2348697047048474
Treatment of H. pylori in peptic ulcer disease cures the acute lesion and prevents relapse and complications.	0.8837358456776725
In clinical management a positive diagnosis of H. pylori is required and other potential causes for ulcer formation must be excluded before starting treatment.	1.0110972619165157
The standard treatment in H. pylori positive ulcer consists of PPI in standard dose and two antibiotics either clarithromycin 2 x 500 mg and amoxycillin 2 x 1 g or metronidazole 2 x 400 mg and clarithromycin 2 x 250 mg (or 500 mg) for 7 days.	1.0301553473591665
The simultaneous presence of H. pylori and NSAID intake requires distinct management.	0.831035536552193
Following bleeding complication a PPI needs to be given beyond 7 days until ulcer healing is endoscopically confirmed.	0.8435656326444059
We present the results of a study conducted in collaboration with the German workers' board to monitor the effectiveness of treatment in 477 cases.	1.311861174540026
The examiners reviewed the charts of patients who had suffered distorsion or luxation of the knee, fractures of the spine with or without neural deficits, calcaneus fractures, rotator cuff lesions and shoulder luxation, and fractures of the acetabulum and pelvis as the result of accidents.	1.2375779891753282
A new documentation sheet was desiged to note administrative and medical data.	0.7140574829441786
All 477 patients' charts and X-rays were reviewed by three trauma surgeons, and procedures were monitored in a prospective manner.	1.1538773679370558
The study revealed considerable discrepancies between the assumed injuries and those ultimately found to have been sustained, especially in the case of knee injuries.	1.0861725733598608
The article reveals the results concerning the validity of the diagnosis and the need for more precisely tailored diagnostic methods for different patient groups.	1.1087365033774945
Our final conclusion is that it is necessary to implement new paths of patient management and better steering features to improve both the quality of medical care and the administrative procedures in place.	1.0553414023513692
A workshop on attenuated cold-adapted influenza virus vaccines (CAIV) was organized in Langen, Germany on December 16-17, 1998 by Prof. Reinhard Kurth, President of the Paul Ehrlich Institute.	0.9547096928513068
Reperfusion injury has become a scientific problem of increasing importance, in part because of recent developments of thrombolytic therapy.	1.0964088292165715
The mechanisms of reperfusion injury following focal cerebral ischemia, however, are not known in detail.	1.1237603359715824
Recent studies strongly suggest that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium overload play an important role in reperfusion injury and that pharmacological interventions against calcium- or free radical-mediated damage could extend the therapeutic window in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.	0.9944499688515434
The mediators involved are known to induce a mitochondrial permeability transition (PT) during the reperfusion period, which is associated with uncoupling of mitochondrial respiration, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and a burst production of ROS, leading to cellular death.	1.140868877642046
The mitochondrial PT is considered to be a key process in reperfusion injury following cerebral ischemia, as also observed in other organs such as heart and liver.	1.0903171608401432
Pharmacological modulation of mitochondrial permeability changes have the potential to reduce tissue damage due to reperfusion.	0.9577107694670526
We performed an open clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of a 1 µg/h ganciclovir implant for the treatment of newly and pretreated cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).	0.9428147585651654
The purpose of this study was to compare the initial stiffness of two techniques for posterior interbody lumbar fusion (PLIF) by a finite element approach.	0.983006442919127
Thus a finite element model of a human L3/4 spinal segment was generated.	0.8496748449343986
Stiffness of the intact model was tested under compression (600 N), torsion (25 Nm) and shearing forces (250 N) without preload.	1.3077680096256656
The results were compared to the stiffness following simulation of PLIF with two BAK-Cages and PLIF with two Harms-Cages and additional posterior screw-rod-osteosynthesis.	0.8315865829930603
PLIF with two BAK-Cages resulted in a loss of stiffness in compression, torsion and shearing.	0.5836396553860821
PLIF with two Harms-Cages and posterior osteosynthesis resulted in an increase of stiffness in compression, torsion and shearing.	0.7026854087772605
Tramadol, an analgesic with mean potency one tenth that of morphine is used regularely for the treatment of chronic and postoperative pain.	1.1307077902943277
Previous reports have indicated that tramadol may induce seizure activity when given together with a selective serotonine reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).	0.8022136903085665
Therefore, its major mode of action may be questioned which purportedly is due to binding with the opioid receptor and partly due to the inhibition of monoamine reuptake.	1.1129364826316808
Aim: The cause of a connatal hemiplegia was retrospectivly investigated in children born at term.	0.9812532380842538
The article gives a short review on the history of the field.	0.9814374972607881
First forensic cases were solved by the use  of medicocriminal entomology in the thirteenth century but the method has only developed to a professional level over the last 100 years.	1.0178520540372626
In Europe, mainly French, Belgian, English and Scandinavian researchers have been responsible for maintaining the methods.	0.8343835119183498
In France, an entomological police laboratory has been set up in Rosny-sous-bois.	0.8516434444282304
In contrast to the United States of America where entomological evidence is accepted by the courts, the method has only just started to be accepted in Germany.	1.106809285302574
Initially cooperation with the police and with judges might help to establish the analysis of arthropods as a routine tool in forensic science for Germany.	1.0019016733001638
27 patients with sternocostoclavicular hyperostosis (SCC) and/or pustulotic arthroosteitis (PAO) were examined with whole body scintigraphy, conventional radiography, and other imaging modalities, such as CT, MRI.	1.1370944389456292
25 of 27 patients with SCCH showed a characteristic high bullhorn-like uptake of the sternocostoclavicular region with the manubrium sterni representing the skull and the inflamed sternocostoclavicular joints corresponding to the horns (=bullhorn-sign).	0.9135426660758815
Scintigraphy revealed additional skeletal manifestations (spondylitis, sacroiliitis, osteitis, periostitis) in 19 of the 27 patients with SCCH and/or PAO.	0.950973842709059
In combination with PPP or psoriasis pustulosa, the typical scintigraphic bullhorn pattern enables the diagnosis of PAO (19 patients) with high confidence.	1.2567314940555934
Patients with SCCH but without skin disease at the time of presentation (8 of 27 patients) may develop PPP later and, therefore, it is justified to classify them as incomplete PAO with high risk to develop other skeletal manifestations later in the course of the disease.	1.1520604528649345
PADAM stands for partial androgen deficiency in the aging male, and it is currently diagnosed with a testosterone level below 3 ng/ml (300 ng/dl or 12 nmol/l), and with symptoms varying according to the individual.	1.1783775105013286
The symptoms are a reduction or even loss of libido, a decline in muscle mass and strength, enhancement of visceral fatty tissue-padding, dryness of the skin, apathy, tiredness and distortion of mood right up to depression, and ostalgia due to osteoporosis.	1.0147863634051855
A 34 year-old pregnant woman presented with reticulate pigmentation of the flexures, the dorsum of the hands and the genitoperianal region.	1.1008541972582242
She was in good health and her family history was unremarkable.	0.8617769003741632
Histologic examination of the hyperpigmented patches revealed pigmented filiform downgrowths of the interfollicular epidermis and follicular infundibula, as well as small epithelial cysts.	0.8177286112278692
Upon immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies, the number of melanocytes appeared normal.	0.9252793404938405
The elongated dendritic processes of the melanocytes contained many mature melanosomes.	0.7128533743824885
In the adjacent keratinocytes large melanosomes did not aggregate into complexes.	0.7373797283388392
The diagnosis of localized reticulate pigmentary disorder was established.	0.8645487952383151
The knowledge of the broad clinical spectrum of localized reticulate hyperpigmentations with its favorable prognosis is of practical importance.	0.8635541052206912
Genital or flexural pigmented lesions have to be differentiated from melanosis of the vulva or acanthosis nigricans.	0.8041265970952791
The presented case gives further evidence that many of the proposed entities characterized clinically by reticulate pigmented macules and hyperkeratotic follicular lesions are different phenotypic expressions of the same autosomal dominant genodermatosis.	0.9517458954332496
Purpose: During the last few years there has been an increasing interest in evaluating quality of life (QOL) data regarding surgical treatment.	1.2659143961871526
Methods: The present study comments the efficacy of laparoscopic antireflux surgery after required Nissen fundoplication of 70 patients.	1.104451865021922
Therefore, the German Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) was used to query the patients preoperatively and three times after surgery up to 1 year.	1.1718545253544017
Results: Preoperatively, we found a low general GIQLI score (mean 92.7 points), which increased 6 weeks postoperatively (116.8 points), 3 months (124.8) and 1 year (mean 123.9 points) significantly and is now comparable to the healthy population (122.6 points).	1.3532094298662052
Conclusion: It is our opinion that the efficacy of the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease with required Nissen fundoplication can also be documented and discussed by using QOL.	1.3333809015535827
Introduction: Serous cystadenomas of the pancreas are rare tumors and thought to be almost always benign.	1.2558399589246145
Methods: We report our experience in the diagnosis and surgical treatment of 12 patients with these tumors.	1.3145914571888029
Results: Between October 1993 and December 1998, 41 patients with cystic tumors of the pancreas underwent surgical resection; in 12 cases (11 women, 1 man) a serous cystadenoma (10 micrcocystic, 2 oligomacrocystic) was found.	1.3303435978638103
Only 6 (50 %) patients had symptoms.	1.2950056699158066
The mean tumor size was 4.8 (2.7-10) cm.	1.374875344744919
Ultrasound, CT and MRT usually could detect the mass, but differentiation with other cystic lesions was not reliable.	1.1079748163954342
All tumors were resected: 4 Whipple procedures, 7 distal pancreatectomies and 1 segmental resection were performed.	1.0007145090943343
No patient died after surgery and none had to be reoperated on.	0.9310115640716365
Conclusions: Because of the difficulty in reliably differentiating benign and malignant lesions of the pancreas, we believe that cystic tumors of the pancreas should be resected.	1.1082597000201588
We examined the prevalence of HIV-associated cutaneous disorders as well as the frequency and efficiency of UV-radiation in HIV-infected patients by evaluating the clinical records of 1310 patients seen between and 1994 and 1996.	1.1983006589951215
41 patients were treated with UVB-radiation and 4 patients with UVA1-radiation, while three patients received PUVA-therapy.	1.0454152559663497
UV-radiation proved to be efficient and safe in the treatment of pruritic papular eruption, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.	0.9517264314519226
Although some in vitro studies and studies with transgenic mice have suggested a negative impact of UV radiation on the immunosystem of HIV-positive patients, no progression of the HIV infection due to phototherapy has been proven.	1.0759932454109458
The staff at interventional radiological procedures is exposed to high levels of ionizing radiation.	0.702646634229487
This applies especially to measures at cardiac catheterization laboratories.	0.7040296821774537
In this study the annual radiation exposure to the staff was estimated by measuring the dose rate under characteristic conditions.	1.0657201304929276
It could be shown that the resulting radiation exposure was strongly dependent on the radiation protection measures and is also dependent on the operation conditions of the x-ray tube.	0.9974600343176857
The effective dose for the physician wearing a lead apron and thyroid shield was detremined to about 1.7 mSva.	1.0119200500695646
Without a thyroid shield an effective dose of about 3.5 mSva resulted.	0.9521638872119486
This corresponds to approximately the natural background radiation of about 2.4 mSva in the Federal Republic of Germany.	0.9189457215600866
From the number of procedures performed we could derive an effective dose of approximately 1-2 µSv per application for the physician, averaged over all types of procedures.	0.9868028208980169
Further, it could be shown that the readings of the film badges, usually worn by the staff, underestimate the effective dose by approximately a factor of two.	1.0480835564338116
This is because the film badges do not include the contribution of the unshielded parts of the body to effective dose.	0.9987055730210203
From the estimated annual effective dose, a lifetime dose of 68 mSv was estimated for a 40-year working career.	0.9710747482959582
The corresponding lifetime risk for induced fatal cancer due to radiation exposure was determined to 0.3% applying the ICRP risk factor of 4  -  10-2 Sv-1.	1.1384237366360581
Considering the NCRP recommendations for a safe occupation, working in a cardiac catheterization laboratory can be considered as safe when applying all radiation protection measures.	1.0167922954453545
However, changing the protection measures and modifying the parameters of the x-ray-tube can lead to strong changes of the radiation exposure and the resulting risk estimation.	1.1807252341755654
Treatment of pulmonary hypertension is an important issue in intensive care.	0.9856755869643559
One therapeutic regimen involves the intravenous administration of prostacyclin (PGI2).	0.7567444626051019
This, however, is accompanied by diminished hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, reduced arterial oxygenation, and systemic vasodilation.	1.0960394487744982
Thus, its clinical usefulness is limited.	1.2976965817184842
However, the inhalation of vasodilators such as nitric oxide (NO) or nebulized PGI2 causes a selective pulmonary vasodilation in ventilated alveoli and improved gas exchange, without any systemic vasodilation.	0.9990251635693439
It has therefore gained importance for the treatment of pulmonary failure associated with high shunt fractions.	1.0776949632726858
However, the inhalation of vasodilators may have adverse effects: in the case of NO, toxic side effects are predominant (MetHb, NOx), whereas in the case of PGI2, technical problems in terms of dosing and administration safety are of major interest.	1.2193302990178991
Furthermore, some patients do not respond to the treatment.	1.3036944024526296
In some individuals a reduction in pulmonary hypertension can be seen, while others lack even pulmonary vasodilation.	1.0619802664234632
The exact pathophysiological mechanisms remain to be investigated.	0.6414502270188556
The treatment of infrarenal aortic aneurysms by means of transluminally placed endovascular prostheses reflects significant progress in the field of vascular surgery.	0.8711603924701964
In the case of infrarenal aortic aneurysm it is possible to achieve technically successful implantation of such a prosthesis in well over 90 % of cases.	1.1313270694809545
The rate of clinical success, meaning lasting effective exclusion of the aortic aneurysm, cannot (yet) be definitively determined, since no long-term results are so far available.	1.148398895411164
Secondary leaks are observed in at least 10 % of all patients, making a further therapy necessary (endorepair, conversion, embolization).	1.0303096760393198
Further development of endovascular prostheses will include optimization of the aortal/iliac attachment of the prostheses, a better configuration and the development of long-lasting materials that can be used for endovascular prostheses.	1.1440005745986819
The frequency of postspinal headaches after accidental puncture of the subarachnoid space with 16 - 18 G Tuohy needles is reported at 59 - 85%.	1.040990445595702
A case of postspinal headache syndrome persisting over a period of 6 weeks following epidural anaesthesia during labour is described.	0.9427988831963618
A 30-year-old women had severe postspinal headache for 6 weeks after epidural anaesthesia during labour.	0.9630209047698486
Conservative therapy for 3 days and 4 days of bedrest followed by cristalloid infusions during a 3-week hospital stay and a subsequent 3-week period of bedrest at home did not lead to lasting pain relief.	1.0671871937506978
Intracranial haematoma and other abnormal processes were excluded by CCT.	0.7569944564984684
A pathologic EEG was not confirmed by cranial MRT.	0.7158034469022742
A lumbar epidural blood patch of 15 ml of autologous blood was performed at L3/4.	0.9315299906260406
The patient stayed in bed for 12 h. After 3 h free of pain the patient complained of recurring headache.	1.0612370776835502
After a further 48 h of bedrest she had recovered.	0.7967014351217441
Because of lumbar pain 4 days after the epidural blood patch a MRT was performed, which showed the blood at L4 to S3 in the epidural space.	1.0360419546896822
The diagnosis of a cerebrospinal fluid leakage was based on the history and the main symptom of postspinal headache: the pain onset in the supine position.	1.212916488506039
Such possible treatments as diminishing subarachnoidal pressure by bedrest, increasing cerebrospinal fluid production by infusions, increasing epidural pressure by epidural infusions and closing the cerebrospinal fluid leakage by epidural blood patch are discussed.	0.8994779600006084
The average success rate with the epidural blood patch is 93%.	0.8340986961762539
Volumes ranging from 5 to 20 ml are discussed for the autologous blood.	0.9098821065857193
We chose 15 ml of blood, to take account of the possibility that blood might settle in the wide sacral space.	1.008138790788413
We were able to document the position of the blood patch as L4 to S3 on MR tomography (the injection site was L3/4).	1.0707285675351057
Most patients are free of headache 1 h after epidural blood patch.	0.8600169574097065
Our patient had to be confined to bed for another 48 h because of recurring headache.	0.7836734149750154
The blood patch alone was not immediately sufficient to prevent all further cerebrospinal fluid leakage.	0.9137458452805384
Probably more than one subarachnoidal puncture had been made during the difficult epidural anesthetic procedure.	0.9792740787170652
On the other hand, the leak was probably only diminished because of the blood patch descending down to the wide sacral space.	0.986927998976651
The combination of the large-volume blood patch, which diminished the leakage, and conservative treatment, which narrowed the transdural pressure difference, was successful: the 6-week postspinal headache was cured.	1.2872448878600917
Prolonged postspinal headache should be treated by epidural blood patch.	0.775757455279609
The use of over 10 ml cannot be generally recommended, although in this case most of the blood patch of 15 ml was localized caudally.	1.1871050392918676
Careful monitoring for side effects is necessary with blood volumes larger than 10 ml.	0.8992255211295824
If there is no immediate relief, conservative therapy with 24 - 48 h of bedrest is recommended.	1.1502896066455837
If the headache persists a second blood patch should be performed, with the volume and the probable caudal spreading of the first taken into account.	1.2320953456560402
The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of carvedilol therapy in addition to conventional heart failure therapy on heart rate variability (HRV) and on left ventricular function in 14 patients with mild to moderate heart failure due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC).	1.0361960583733434
After a 3- to 4-week titration period, carvedilol was titrated up to 50mg daily, or the highest dose tolerated (at least 25mg daily).	1.1976108735976807
Maintenance treatment was then continued for 8 weeks.	0.7742446352625333
Digital 24-hour Holter recordings were obtained at baseline and after 8 weeks of carvedilol therapy.	0.937899575865225
HRV for the entire 24-hour period was computed in the time domain using the Oxford Medilog Excel 2 analysis system.	0.9853685849652156
Measures of HRV included the mean of all coupling intervals between normal beats (RRm), the standard deviation of all normal RR intervals (SDNN), the square root of the mean of the squared differences between adjacent normal RR intervals (rMSSD), and the proportion of adjacent normal RR intervals differing >50ms (pNN50).	1.0955319698978456
The histologic determination of the degree of tissue anaplasia and grade of malignancy of gliomas is based upon qualitative histological features (nuclear pleomorphism, mitoses, endothelial proliferation, tumor necrosis).	1.0181609131971265
This grading approach is influenced by the subjective interpretation of the pathologist, especially concerning the weighting of criteria (scant, moderate, pronounced).	1.0182216149572152
An observer-independent approach seems to be feasible by abandoning the concept of parameter weighting in favor of an binary approach noting only the presence or absence of these structure parameters.	0.8630720247384186
This grading procedure is recognized in the revised WHO classification of brain tumors for common type astrocytomas (Ste.	0.9105204392431144
Anne-Mayo System, SAMS).	0.640945902194529
Our results indicate that a similiar approach is also suitable for grading purposes of oligodendrogliomas and mixed gliomas.	0.8139723626945072
Our recent investigations on glioma grading showed, both for astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, that a two-tiered grading scheme distinguishing only "low-grade" and "high-grade" cases was prognostically relevant.	1.172198546303684
For all glioma entities the onset of tumor angiogenesis with endothelial proliferation and contrast enhancement in CT and MRI seems to be the key criterion indicating irreversible tumor progression to the "high" malignancy grade.	1.0439423062643234
In patients with severe angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease, who are not candidates for either percutaneous coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery, transmyocardial laser revascularization (TMR) often leads to improvement of clinical symptoms and increased exercise capacity.	1.068447077291156
One drawback of TMR is the need for surgical thoracotomy in order to gain access to the epicardial survace of the heart.	0.9441160846151159
Therefore, a catheter-based system has been developed, which allows creation of laser channels into the myocardium from the left ventricular cavity.	1.2514004569893888
Several phase III studies have proven that the beta-interferons have positive effects on the number and severity of acute exacerbations of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.	0.9346139089528033
Recently the first study on the effectiveness of interferon beta-1b in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis was published.	1.0418230757409774
In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study 718 patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and an expanded disability status scale (EDSS) value between 3.0 and 6.5 were treated with either 8 Mio.	0.9735992568744753
interferon beta-1b or placebo subcutaneously every second day for two to three years.	0.8528162799973111
The primary study end-point was the time until confirmed progression of the disease as signified by a one point increase of the EDSS value (for initial EDSS values between 3.0 and 5.5) or 0.5 point increase when the initial EDSS value was between 6.0 and 6.5.	1.2818690990196098
After two years an interim analysis showed a highly significant difference in delay of disease progression by nine to twelve months for the treatment group (p=0.0008).	1.108266856354767
This means that interferon beta-1b is the first recombinant beta-interferon to be shown effective in the treatment of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.	1.08145119538901

Cases of female patients who suppose having been sexually abused by their fathers during (early) childhood and wish to explore and work on healing this trauma are being discussed.	0.9106381508019231
As a result of projection and counter transference the therapist developes feelings of distrust, disbelief and of being involved in a "hysterical theatre performance" so that this sort of therapy is very difficult to conceive and carry out.	1.048384771173098
In this contribution an attempt is being made to understand these patients and to examine their psychodynamic background as well as the deeper meaning of their above mentioned theatrical efforts.	1.1120591534650142
On the basis of these cases we can put the following psychodynamic hypotheses: 1) The incest-phantasy is a narcissistic attempt; 2) The incest-phantasy is a symbolic representation; 3) in the sense of a symbolic wish-fullfillment included in the parent-child-interaction.	1.1085708344211322
After this, an attempt is being made to examine in various therapeutical scenes the role of these phantasis during the transference procedings and finally to develope diagnostic criteria with which these patients can be differentiated from others with definitely witnessed sexual abuse cases so that consequently treatment techniques can be devised in future.	0.9663995782669123
Hospitals and clinics for ambulant surgery shall identify and register certain officially defined nosocomial infections (Surveillance) as well as the isolation of bacteria with special and important antimicrobial resistancies (§ 23 Abs.	0.9876461129726036
1 IfSG = Infection Prevention Act).	0.5412062133088965
The nosocomial infections to be recorded, i. e device associated infections and postsurgical woundinfections, have been selected on the basis of national and international experiences with the surveillance of nosocomial infections.	1.0396605880338163
Important antimicrobial resistancies have been determined according to both the prevalence of the bacteria in nosocomial settings as well as their clinical and epidemiological importance.	1.1266175299111125
Most of the relevant data may be provided by the clinical microbiology laboratory but shall be collected, listed and discussed by the staff of wards or surgery clinics.	1.0167847185666812
Both types of documentation shall be used to identify and eradicate problems in hygiene management and to stop further distribution of difficult to treat bacteria like MRSA.They are part of the quality assurance management according to § 137 SGB V.	1.035671229681452
Nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC) belong to the most frequent malignant tumours in certain parts of the world, e. g., south-east Asia, while they occur infrequently in western  Europe.	1.0686221954044366
The association of NPCs with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a transforming human herpes virus, is well established.	1.1036606874253194
The current WHO classification recognises two major NPC histotypes, non-keratinising NPC and squamous cell NPC.	0.8733318192290597
EBV is invariably present in non-keratinising NPCs and the viral oncoprotein LMP-1 (latent membrane protein-1) is expressed in some cases.	1.0789082226474398
The tumour cells of non-keratinising NPCs show phenotypic features which are inducible by LMP-1 in  vitro.	0.9119049461269679
These may contribute to the development of the lymphoid stroma which is characteristic of this tumour type.	0.983937323965947
Furthermore, the virus is detectable in nasopharyngeal carcinoma in situ.	0.8871582113486027
Thus, the virus is likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of  non-keratinising NPCs.	1.1492536486404092
By contrast, the association of squamous cell NPCs with EBV  displays a geographical variability.	0.9757145810667682
It appears, therefore, that squamous cell NPCs are a heterogenous group of tumours distinct from non-keratinising NPCs.	1.0213776197684796
To assess treatment outcome and prognostic factors following postoperative external radiotherapy in 77 patients with low-grade glioma.	0.9507656813871188
Between 1977 and 1996, 45 patients with astrocytoma, 14 with oligodendroglioma and 18 with mixed glioma received postoperative radiotherapy with a median total dose of 52 Gy (range, 45 to 61 Gy).	1.0316406666931226
Sixty-seven patients were treated immediately following surgery, 10 patients with tumor progression.	1.3032227462505326
The influence of various factors including histology, gender, age, seizures, duration of symptoms (<= 6 weeks vs > 6 weeks), CT pattern (enhancement vs no enhancement), type of surgery, total radiotherapy dose and timing of radiotherapy on relapse-free survival and overall survival was investigated.	1.145464279595054
The median overall survival time was 81 month, the 5- and 10-year survival rates were 54% and 31%, respectively.	1.308336626235764
The median time to progression was 56 months, while the 5- and 10-year progression-free survival rates were 45% and 24%.	1.2952350875754892
Univariate analyses identified the total radiotherapy dose (p = 0.01), duration of symptoms (p = 0.05), the presence of seizures (p = 0.04), and the CT pattern following intravenous contrast (p = 0.005) as significant prognostic factors for overall survival.	1.102166321245019
Progression-free survival rates were influenced by the total dose (p = 0.04), the duration of symptoms (p = 0.01) and CT pattern (p = 0.006).	0.9563040649013442
On multivariate analysis, only the CT pattern (enhancement vs no enhancement) remained as independent prognostic factors for both progression-free survival and overall survival.	0.9391994903922115
A minimum total dose of 52 Gy is recommended for the postoperative radiotherapy in low-grade glioma.	1.029658015072073
Tumors with CT enhancement seem to need further intensification of treatment.	0.6759250890832478
We report three patients with severe Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS).	0.9809671232608562
On clinical examination, no sensory deficit was elicited.	0.8928774119686417
Electromyography (EMG) and motor nerve conduction velocity (NCV) studies were indicative of an axonal lesion.	0.9114539212949522
In two patients, we found total peripheral conduction block without volitional EMG activity.	1.0505745358811007
Sensory NCV and cortical median nerve evoked potentials remained normal.	0.6771631044391867
Sural nerve biopsy revealed unequivocal alterations of sensory nerve fibers, some in the form of primary demyelination.	1.0252163803824526
Therefore, these cases must bei classified as combined motor-sensory syndromes despite the clinical and electrophysiological findings.	1.2949853674723506
Although total denervation of the extremity muscles occurred, causing tetraparalysis, this manifestation appears to be attributable to the secondary axonal variant.	1.093585815974842
In contrast to positive reports in literature, immunomodulatory treatment proved ineffective in all three cases.	1.0228091356090747
Continuous spinal anaesthesia (CSA) is a further means of central nerve block for anaesthesia besides single-shot spinal (SSS), combined spinal/epidural, and epidural anaesthesia.	1.1995324689327638
Do hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected food handlers represent a risk for the consumer?	0.9369975357154026
Epidemiological data on HCV transmission  in our opinion do not provide a basis for excluding HCV positive individuals from working as food handlers in general.	0.9973163606249318
Such restrictions seem to be justified only if HCV infected employees might infect their colleagues while performing occupational activities that are associated with a high risk of contracting percutaneous injuries and overt bleeding.	0.9390138989250043
Recently, good functional and anatomical results have been reported in treating full thickness macular holes.	1.2366572711108244
Only a few studies describe a removal of a membrane at the vitreoretinal interface after having removal of the vitreous and its cortex.	0.9679461886276224
To demonstrate the beneficial effects of removing this membrane at the vitreoretinal interface we present our functional and anatomical results in this retrospective study.	0.9662394111246958
Dementia-screening in clinical routine requires short, sensitive and specific tools.	0.9117648204122513
A number of standardized instruments are available for this purpose.	1.0715511943923757
The present study analysed the relationship between size of three examplary dementia-screening tests and their diagnostic accuracy.	1.0877524551780104
A phlebological report requires that an exact diagnostic investigation of the peripheral vein system be carried out to assess both function and morphology.	1.0408857635611333
The most important, reproducible findings can be obtained using dynamic phlebodynamometry and ascending pressure phlebography, as a second expert can directly reconstruct the process by which assessments have been made.	1.2224062376515223
Additional quantification information can be obtained by measuring reflux using colour- coded duplex sonography.	0.9339595677962579
A thrombophilic condition should always be investigated in terms of haemotasis.	0.7654904276876425
In patients with severe post-thrombotic disease, a chronic compartment syndrome of the posterior spaces should be reckoned with, and in such patients magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography and, if possible, dynamic compartment manometry are additional suitable methods of examination.	1.322499489389701
There is currently no generally valid schematization of the post-thrombotic syndrome on which to base an expert opinion.	0.8375424441404268
When evaluating patients, we largely follow our own new classification, which distinguishes four stages based on clinical tissue sclerosis.	1.1417537984408639
Since systemic treatment of neuropathic plantar ulcers in diabetics (DNPU) has so far been rather ineffective, recent reports of successful management of DNPU by short-term retrograde transvenous leg perfusions (RVP) by South American angiologists encouraged us to apply this treatment method in diabetics suffering from chronic DNPU.	1.0621787525848942
Hence, in a prospective comparative clinical trial started in 1989 we have treated 45 male diabetics suffering from DNPU with the same daily doses of netilmycin, administered either in systemic venous infusions (SVI: n=21, three times/day) or in RVP (n=24, once/day).	1.195669757739536
After 10 consecutive days of treatment, ulcers had closed in 8 of the 24 patients treated with RVP, as against 3 of the 21 treated with SVI.	1.0981292179961508
Diminution of the ulcer area by >30% including full debridement was achieved in 10/24 of the RVP cases (SVI: 4/21).	1.062176689992644
During 6 months of follow-up, amputation of toes or forefoot was necessary in only 1 patient in the RVP group, but in 4 in the SVI group.	1.2280780745629176
Partial restitution of osteolytic damage was observed in some cases after RVP.	0.9094020227621624
Our results show that regional netilmycin therapy given by the RVP procedure is clearly superior to equal netilmycin doses administered by SVI for the treatment of DNPU.	0.8772993934295243
RVP can be recommended in DNPU, particularly when the ulcers are complicated by infections.	1.134553610813301
There is hardly any other discipline that illustrates the conflict between the freedom of science and research, that is to say, ultimately, what is medically possible, and human dignity and the protection of life or, in other words, what can be justified in ethical or legal terms, so clearly as reproduction medicine.	1.1253805152972092
The topics involved in this conflict cover a broad spectrum, ranging from in vitro fertilization with subsequent implantation of the embryo through the problems of multiple pregnancy and selective feticide, the many questions raised by assisted fertilization, and especially by anonymous sperm donation, and the controversial techniques of preimplantation diagnosis and cryopreservation, to the legal aspects of prenatal diagnosis, some of which have already been the subjects of cases decided in the supreme courts.	1.237754924629965
In a good many of these sectors it is difficult to reconcile what doctors can do and what it is admissible for them to do, so that it is hardly surprising that there is often no general consensus.	0.9456294286005092
Against this backdrop objective discussion is all the more important, and the notes in this paper, which necessarily touch on only some of the matters at issue, are intended to stimulate such discussion.	1.1659568681865562
In MR-imaging, similar to computed tomography, diagnosis of metastatic lymph-node disease is based on lymph-node sizes, and thereby it is non-specific.	1.1552323732296639
Superparamagnetic iron oxide as a potential contrast medium for MR-lymphography accumulate in normal lymph node tissue after endolymphatic, interstitial and, in case of very small particles, after intravenous injection.	1.0797328354121827
No accumulation occures in lymph node metastases.	0.6510175585956672
Lymph-node metastases can be detected by all three injection techniques.	0.9881759316454708
It has been shown experimentally, that in particular small metastases can be detected in normal sized lymph nodes.	1.2240600062338953
However, MR-lymphography also has inherent methodologic problems, as there may occure an uneven distribution of the contrast medium between different lymph-node groups.	1.312161431405525
The experimental results with endolymphatic, interstitial, and intravenous MR-lymphography as well as first clinical results with intravenous contrast medium injection are presented and discussed.	1.1110449048747537
The purpose of this study was to evaluate anatomical and functional results of vitreoretinal silicone oil surgery for complicated retinal detachments due to trauma and myopia in children and juveniles.	0.9799379540693046
In 1993, we adopted conventional thoracic and abdominal prosthetic grafting and tailored aortoplasty (TAP) of the thoraco-abdominal aortic segment III/IV in chronic-expanding type B aortic dissection (CEAD) to achieve 2 primary goals: 1. reduction of renal/visceral and spinal cord ischemic time; 2. safe and secure reperfusion of all critical aortic branches for prevention of major complications, i. e. paraplegia, kidney failure, and intestinal infarction.	1.1860368955677412
Among 71 thoracoabdominal aortic reconstructions since 1993, 5 CEAD patients (median age 47.8 yr, mean CEAD- 6.5 cm, 4 with Marfan Syndrome) underwent TAP.	1.2763862740644059
Selection criteria are: 1.	0.5783036109130101
CEAD- >5 cm 2. expansion rate >=5 mm/6 months 3. involvement of the critical aortic segment III/IV.	1.2711505479979022
TAP consists of: 1. left posterolateral aortotomy from Th 8 - L 2, 2. excision of the intraaortic dissection membrane(s) 3. aortic closure to a diameter of 3 cm to reduce wall tension.	1.226531984320237
All 5 patients survived without any major complications, particularly no paraplegia.	0.9525084115674977
Mean cross-clamping was 43 min.	0.7444700289689722
After 7 months, 1 patient was successfully repaired due to false aneurysm at the distal thoracic graft suture line.	1.090178360568142
After mean follow-up of 2.4 years, CT-angiography revealed a stable TAP segment (mean aortic- 3.2 cm) in 4 patients and one re-expanded TAP segment (from 4 cm after 24 months up to 7 cm) without signs of re-dissection.	1.3043785646220782
Our 4-year-results (1) corroborate the Johns Hopkins data.	1.077076661089386
Although one re-expanded TAP segment is disquieting, we found the short-term gains so rewarding to strongly advocate the tailored approach as a principle means of avoiding paraplegia in this extremely high risk group of patients.	0.9943499582915339

Therefore it can be concluded that the resulting isomers are chemically identical in all respects except for the direction with which they rotate plane-polarized light.	0.9841167779685337
When the isomer and its corresponding enantiomer are present in equal proportions, they are called racemic mixture, a mixture that does not rotate polarized light, since the optical activities of the two isomers cancel each other.	1.0615133085060993
Although the isomers are chemically identical other optically active molecules can interact with these isomers in a geometrically specific way termed stereoselectivity.	0.7763188231005828
The human body comprises a chiral environment due to optically active proteins; thus it is not surprising that enantiomeric drugs exhibit different pharmacological properties, when used as pure optical isomers.	0.9677763821940116
Till today most modern anaesthetics have been optical isomers, which are mainly used as racemic mixture (1:1 mixture).	1.2122275110638001
For financial reasons pure isomers were only used for research purposes, but nowadays the wide clinical use of pure isomers is financially feasible due to new production techniques.	0.9626246229137324
The terms eutomer and distomer were chosen to indicate the more or less potent form of the drug.	0.8854555330953925
The clinical use of pure isomers is only of advisable, if there are significant differences between eutomer and distomer in desired or side effects.	1.0171008219724147
Among the modern anaesthetics ketamine, isoflurane, bupivacaine and atracurium exhibit an asymmetric carbon.	0.7893717348979646
For most drugs the separation in pure isomers will reduce side effects.	0.7522839484759486
For volatile anaesthetics this question is still unanswered, since experimental and clinical results are inconsistent so far.	1.036156839950176
The high prevalence of aspirin intolerance in asthmatics and patients with nasal polyps as well as reports of familial clustering suggest a genetic disposition of this disease.	0.9376745827608809
Our study aimed at obtaining further evidence of hereditary factors in this disease.	0.8503412943422568
We included 33 unselected patients from 28 families with aspirin intolerance and rhinosinusitis in this study.	0.802229135536389
Controls were recruited from individuals treated in our ENT clinic for diseases other than aspirin intolerance (n=52).	0.8654585996068067
The application of a tryptophan-free amino acid mixture (tryptophan depletion test) induces a rapid and substantial lowering of both total and free plasma tryptophan.	0.9959179321601442
Consequently, the brain serotonin content and also cerebral serotonin function are decreased.	1.0834055287153004
This method provides a paradigm to study the role of serotonin in the pathobiology of depressive disorders and their treatment modalities.	0.8872554587334412
Untreated depressed patients show few behavioral effects during tryptophan depletion.	0.7070944449356471
In depressed patients during an antidepressant or light-therapy-induced stable remission, a transient depressive relapse was induced by tryptophan depletion.	0.9583881576972666
Healthy subjects with a genetic risk for affective disorder show worsening of their condition induced by tryptophan depletion.	0.867495333741964
These findings indicate the relevance of altered brain serotonin function in the pathophysiology of affective disorders and strengthen the importance of serotonin in the mechanism of action of antidepressants.	0.9322369597726131
Since recently published studies revealed some evidence that the serotonergic system is directly involved in the pathophysiology of various psychiatric syndromes besides depression, it seems to be reasonable to evaluate the validity of the tryptophan depletion test also in non-depressed patients.	1.0274356863029501
Several common chronic pain syndromes come to the attention of the rheumatologist demanding for differentiation from fibromyalgia (FM), although they are often associated with it.	1.133975370707816
They may mimick FM by (1) the occurance of wide spread pain, (2) the chronicity of complaints, (3) the preponderance of females in some of these, and (4) the lack of objective data to be derived from imaging techniques and laboratory tests.	1.1570617770955378
Pain is produced by the disturbance of normal function ("dysfunctional syndromes", MASI, ref.	1.1575349246656657
Recognition requires examination of the locomotor system under biomechanical auspices both at rest and during movement in order to diagnose hyper- and hypomobility syndromes; treatment of these conditions is guided by principles to improve biomechanical function.	1.119128078675393
In addition, the skin needs to be examined to detect panniculosis (also called "cellulitis"), which may be mixed up with FM due to its preferential occurance in peri- or postmenopausal women.	1.1892531360265837
It is concluded that the aforementioned differential diagnosis needs to be considered appropriately in coinciding FM and all studies dealing with FM.	0.9518217444669722
In a prospective, randomized study of patients with acute manifestation of coronary heart disease and hypercholesterolemia (LDL cholesterol >=130<=250mg/dl), we compared the effect of an early-initiated, intensified therapy to usual care antilipidemic therapy with respect to coronary lesions and clinical events.	1.2560997961880005
Patients were included immediately following acute myocardial infarction and/or PTCA because of severe/instable angina pectoris.	0.9788612125877714
The intensified therapy consisted of pravastatin 20-40mg with addition of colestyramine and/or nicotinic acid, if necessary, to achieve an LDL cholesterol <=130mg/dl.	0.9758806263265503
In the control group, antilipidemic therapy was left up to the private physician.	0.8383125560154563

Abrupt vessel closure of the dilated vessel continues to represent a significant limitation of coronary angioplasty.	0.8444982228831825
Despite increasing operator experience and improved technology, abrupt vessel closure continues to represent the most important complication of balloon angioplasty.	0.9396304609647409
Intracoronary stent implantation and pharmaceutical blockade of the GP IIb/IIIa receptor serve as effective tools in the prevention of abrupt vessel closure without completely resolving this problem.	0.8936003967101513
About 50% of patients presenting with abrupt vessel closure exhibit additional complications including myocardial infarction, necessity of CABG or death occurring in up to 10% of acute occlusions.	1.1053272785237114
The purpose of this study is to evaluate if quantitative coronary angiography and assessment of clinical and laboratory data allows risk stratification concerning the probability of abrupt vessel closure.	1.0756456420861773
PTCA in the setting of acute coronary syndrome is associated with a markedly increased risk of abrupt vessel closure, indicating that different risk factors may contribute to the development of abrupt vessel closure in patients presenting with stable angina or acute coronary insufficiency syndromes.	1.0522354075635707
Since the skin dose becomes the limiting factor while deciding the tumorcidal dose, the detailed analysis of dose distribution in the build-up region is necessary for high-energy photon beams.	1.0376561491634955
In this study the beam characteriwstics affecting the build-up and skin dose for 6- and 18-MV photons are analyzed.	1.1270071304005305
Measurements were made with 6- and 18-MV photons using a PTW parallel-plate ionization chamber (B23344-036) and a RDM-1F electrometer.	1.0253509464113668
Build-up ionization measurements were made with the chamber fitted into a 25 x 25 x 25 cm polystyrene phantom with a fixed SSD of 100 cm.	0.9182333953655512
The entrance and buildup dose measurements were made with a polycarbonate and a mesh type metallic shielding tray and a 45 ° wedge.	0.8595090500040174
Exit dose measurements were carried out for the graphite patient supporting assembly table top, 1.0 cm thick piece of wood and the 1.0 cm thick patient supporting perspex base frame for head and neck treatments.	1.0068743030262168
It was observed that the dmax decreased slightly with field size as with other accelerators.	0.8627761753877746
For both photon energies the surface dose was observed to increase with increase in field size.	1.0013572477625852
It was also noticed that the dose in the build-up region increases slightly when the polycarbonate secondary blocking tray is introduced with the increase in surface dose.	1.0092095843106377
The data show that the tray pertubation factor (TPF) at surface decreases steadily with tray-surface distance for both photon beams for all field sizes.	0.9576751948944626
It was noted that the TPF was more when the polycarbonate tray was introduced at shorter tray-surface distances for both energies.	0.8796062113128446
At tray-surface distances above 60 cm the TPF almost remained close to unity for 6-MV photons for all field sizes, whereas the continuous decrease in TPF could be noted for 18-MV photon beams even after the TPF rewached unity.	1.0228358764863679
The increase in surface dose with field size for both photon energies is due to the electron scattering from the intervening materials.	0.8869607869011386
The use of wedge filters absorbs low-energy scattered electrons siginificantly and hence, the relative surface dose (RSD) is always less than unity.	1.056886554639126
The increase in dose enhancement percentage with graphite compared to perspex supporting assembly indicates that the electron backscatter is proportional to the atomic number of the medium.	0.8717056106152299
We investigated the nutritional value of a very low fat diet (diet I) adapted to nutritional habits in Germany.	1.0929415836583014
Data were compared to a low fat diet (diet II) according to the American Heart Association.	0.9166247767515772
The study was performed in 37 patients with coronary heart disease (30 males and 7 females, age 45-83 yrs) stratified to the 2 dietary treatments.	1.1790978600532058
Daily fat intake was 38g (24% of energy intake of 6.5MJ/d) in diet I and 60g (31% of 7.3MJ/d) in diet II (p<0.01), respectively.	1.20795816838758
When compared with dietII, in dietI the intake of cholesterol, saturated and monunsaturated fatty acids, Vit.	0.9319912306294235
B12 were all reduced (p<0.01), whereas the uptake of Vit.	0.9760524137055784
C was increased p<0.01.	1.0887772988918782
The intake of folic acid was low in both groups.	0.7109805688121189
Both diets resulted in a decrease in BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, plasma cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels.	0.828955330512067
Concomitantly plasma triglycerides only decreased in response to dietI but HDL cholesterol levels remained unchanged.	0.6950798497296474
Reduction of BMI and cholesterol levels were dependent on baseline BMI and cholesterol concentrations, respectively.	0.6729286193517451
The cholesterol lowering effect of diet I is in part attributed to the weight lowering effect of the diet.	0.9364386074492174
Taking into account the nutritional habits in Germany, very low fat diets seem to be adequate with respect to their nutritional value.	1.0968065286248576
Both diets are effective in lowering body weight, plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels without affecting HDL cholesterol.	0.7533336093067767
These effects are most pronounced in overweight and hypercholesterolemic patients.	0.739124433914015
Besides autopsy determined findings of a fibro-fatty replacement in the right ventricular myocardium, no assured clinical evidence of arrhythmogenie right ventricular dysplasia-cardiomyopathy (ARVD) exists yet.	1.0251796142128264
Criteria for the clinical diagnosis of AVRD were complied in 1994 by members of the ISFC work group and the European Association for Cardiology.	1.0228567820500158
These criteria include structural, functional, histological, and electrophysiological abnormalities, which were divided into major and minor criteria.	1.1661687964996406
With the successive examination of a collective of 24 patients with a histologically determined diagnosis of ARVD at the Jean Rostand Hospital in Ivry-sur-Seien, France, the value of the complied criteria were checked.	0.9833244663628834
Global or segmental dilatation of the right ventricle in the sense of major criteria could be proven in 20 patients (83%) using angiography or electrocardiography.	1.3111759284657734
Four patients (16%) exhibited only minor criteria in the radionuclear angioscintigraphy or right ventricular angiography in the form of segmental kinetic disturbances of the right ventricular.	1.0774771214200065
In all patients, the typical fibrofatty replacement in the right ventricular myocardium could be histologically determined.	1.1012142711048485

A localized QRS-widening of more than 110ms in V1 to V3 in 8 patients (33%) and an epsilon wave in 6 patients (25%) were observed as major criteria.	1.062203808494634
A late potential analysis using signal averaged ECG was only present in 8 patients with positive results in 4 cases (50%) in the sense of minor criteria.	1.1998317045905507
Left bundle branch block ventricular tachycardia, which was classified as a minor criterion, was observed in 23 patients (96%); only one patient died without proven arrhythmia from rapidly progressing heart failure.	1.2427827140139178
A previous history of unexpected sudden death in family members as a minor criterion arose in 3 of 19 patients (15%).	0.8963991386146655
The complied task force criteria for the diagnosis of AVRD led in all 24 cases to the diagnosis of the disease, whereby the value of a determined histological diagnosis was the gold standard.	1.1042022388515382
Without inclusion of histological data, the clinical diagnosis was determined in only 10 cases.	1.3151452219318913

Doses of NSAIDs could be adjusted on demand.	0.6162971379118208
Efficacy parameters, Ritchies Index for swelling and pain, ESR, CRP, pain on VAS and NSAID dose were documented at baseline and 6 and 12 weeks after initiation.	0.9359725620700815
Mean values and medians were calculated to compare the groups for significant or clinically relevant change from baseline or difference between both groups at any time point of observation.	0.6645280315684193
Results: A total of 78 patients were recruited in 4 centers, the data have been published in abstractform.	1.2584310738045479
Only 37 patients (verum 18, placebo 19), enrolled in Ratingen were available for detailled efficacy and safety analysis.	1.0931408213773925
All evaluations in these patients were performed by one investigator (G.H.).	1.188131285488947
There was no subjective, clinical or laboratory parameter showing a significant or clinically relevant change from baseline or difference between both groups at any time point of observation.	0.7126618487211577

Due to its low solubility and the high maximum concentration delivered by the vaporizer sevoflurane is especially suitable for the performance of low flow anaesthetic techniques.	0.9681737445649885
High flow phases for wash-in or wash-out of anaesthetic gases can be kept short, the difference between the volatile's concentration in the fresh gas and within the breathing system is comparatively small, and the time constants are short even during low flow anaesthesia.	1.1406222231344672
The monitoring, required to sufficiently ensure the safety of the patients, corresponds to the current obliging technical safety standards.	0.9461081014480203
As compound A may accumulate in the breathing system, sevoflurane should not be administered with fresh gas flows lower than 1.0 l/min, until the scientific discussion on nephrotoxicity of this substance in humans is solved.	1.0103534742332168
Low flow anaesthesia guarantees a sufficient and continuous wash-out of trace gases.	0.8582735140031714
Thoroughly the use of sevoflurane with dry soda lime must be avoided, as this volatile in an extreme exothermic reaction is absorbed nearly totally and degraded to a considerable degree by dry carbon dioxide absorbent.	1.0128231243578414
The gaseous degradation products are pungent and possibly may be harmful to the patients.	0.8510617414635777

Object of this review is to present the physiological principles, diagnostic techniques and therapeutic options that are related to modifications of oxygen delivery in sepsis.	1.1444070665515633
Despite intense research activities in this area, many topics regarding oxygen transport and oxygen consumption in sepsis are still not clear.	1.0830765338299633
For example, the often discussed shift of the critical value of oxygen delivery to higher values in sepsis has not been proven, yet.	1.1570657444021946
Beside an impaired regional perfusion also disturbances in the cellular oxygen utilization may be responsible for organ failure in sepsis.	1.000661168357975
Until now, it was not shown, whether the increase of oxygen delivery to supranormal levels reduces mortality in septic patients.	1.0958719926113674
It is also unknown, which catecholamine and which infusion solution is suitable for the treatment of septic patients.	1.1168707345335016
In future further research is necessary to solve the problems associated with sepsis therapy.	0.9588857542586489
The rapid sequence induction of anaesthesia in patients with an increased risk of pulmonary aspiration is a quite involved procedure associated with many potential dangers.	0.9284450366137025
A new nasogastric balloon tube has been developed, which will prevent the reflux of gastric contents by blocking the cardia with a balloon.	0.9562416871911019
It was the aim of this initial study to assess the efficiency of the tube in animals, healthy volunteers and patients.	1.1797870629826896
With the approval of the Animal Ethics Committee, a total of 16 anaesthetised pigs were used for the animal experiments.	1.0209195607113368
Balloon occlusion of the cardia was performed in 10 pigs.	0.972426654346567
Six further pigs with an unblocked cardia served as controls.	0.6343365382795696
Vomiting and regurgitation was provoked in each animal using six different manoeuvres while the gastro-oesophageal (lower oesophageal) sphincter and intragastric pressures were monitored and the lower oesophagus was continuously inspected using an endoscope.	0.9145994715596923
With local Ethics Committee approval and informed written consent, (1) repeated vomiting was provoked in 16 awake, healthy adult volunteers (10 females, 6 males, 29 +/- 4 years) with a fluid-filled stomach in the presence and in the absence of balloon occlusion of the cardia, while intragastric pressure was monitored, and (2) 30 patients (21 - 89 years) with an increased risk of pulmonary aspiration scheduled for abdominal or traumatologic surgery received conventional induction of anesthesia after blocking of the cardia with the balloon.	1.2394601149041562
Pigs (n=10) with a blocked cardia showed no gastrooesophageal reflux during a total of 60 manipulations to provoke vomiting and regurgitation, while 28 of the 36 provoking manipulations induced reflux in pigs (n=6) with an unblocked cardia.	1.1769465500503968
Among the healthy volunteers with a blocked cardia (n=16), reflux of gastric contents was not observed during repeated attempts to stimulate vomiting.	1.0792561631741606
After termination of the occlusion of the cardia, reflux was able to be induced by 14 of the 16 volunteers.	0.9688217030445503
In 30 patients with an increased risk of pulmonary aspiration the cardia was blocked and anaesthesia was induced using a mask and manual ventilation without encountering any problems.	0.9864646911249433
The average time from loss of consciousness to tracheal intubation was 164 +/- 8 s. Conclusions.	1.0421019791248862
It is concluded from the present results, with further clinical studies pending, that the gastric balloon probe permits low-risk conventional induction sequence of anaesthesia in patients with an increased risk for pulmonary aspiration and that the device may also be safely used during the extubation phase.	1.2348561417885233
The article explains the cognitive psychoanalytic theory of psychotherapy developed by Weiss and discusses the theory in the field between psychoanalytic and cognitive-behavioristic theories and therapeutic techniques.	0.9643985302933703
The basic assumption is: pathogenic beliefs that are based on traumatic childhood experiences prevent normal desirable goals.	0.8094441254853477
Patients are unconsciously motivated to overcome pathogenic beliefs.	0.5972704047101396
In psychotherapy, the patient works to disprove pathogenic beliefs by testing them in the relationship with the therapist.	1.0833506022116008

Delayed admission to care units leads to a positi- ve cost effect of nootropics.	0.8322248334913355
Thus, also for economic reasons it seems advisable to treat patients with nootropics.	1.1917523422841456
Better effects are gained when nootropic treatment is combined with training and changing of the structure of the environment.	0.9082649679632226
A proposal for a rational treatment with nootropics is derived from the data.	0.8203251317507287
Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of high-dose Gd-DTPA-BMA (gadodiamide, Omniscan) as a contrast for magnetic resonance imaging of malignant bone tumors and the use of high-dose dynamic studies for predicting the response to preoperative chemotherapy.	1.1036687331736783
Simulation has gained an important role in medical education and continuing education in the field of anaesthesia and emergency medicine.	1.1049358524107287
This article gives background information on how full-scale simulators are applied in medical education as well as in continuing education for advanced anesthesia and scientific applications.	1.11983756702338
Acceptance of training seems enhanced by inclusion of the human factor aspect, since this has proven  to be a major source for the development of critical situations in our specialty.	1.2409899131201019
Furthermore, drawbacks of the simulators available and the current training availability in Germany is described.	1.1809905453816985
We evaluated changes in brain tissue oxygen pressure (ptiO2) and global cerebral blood flow (CBF) during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) in ten anesthetized New Zealand White rabbits (body weight 2.5 +/- 0.5 kg).	1.0974616624287579
CBF [hydrogen desaturation (clearance)-technique) and ptiO2 (Licox-microsensor) right frontoparietal cortex] were determined.	1.0220696417108612
After median sternotomy, the animals were placed on CPB (standard roller pump, nonpulsatile, -stat acid-base management, perfusion flow of 180-200 mL/kg/min, right atrial and aortic cannulation) for induction of DHCA by cooling to 15 °C rectal temperature (1 °C per minute).	1.1463116596342364
Rewarming period was started after 60 minutes of circulatory arrest and the rabbits were weaned from CPB without the use of any inotropic or vasoactive support.	0.9313271756670559
Under baseline conditions, ptiO2 was 38 +/- 5 mmHg and did not change significantly before DHCA.	0.8706812559804427
During DHCA the ptiO2 decreased within 15 minutes to 14 +/- 5 mmHg, after 30 minutes to 5 +/- 1 mmHg and after 40 minutes to zero.	1.0225793458963097
Neither the ptiO2 nor CBF recovered fully following restoration of bypass flow and reperfusion: ptiO2 (25 +/- 4 mmHg vs. baseline: 38 +/- 5 mmHg, p<0.05) and CBF (43 +/- 8 vs. baseline: 68 +/- 11 ml/100 g/min, p<0.05) were significantly reduced.	1.07896892921643
Arterial and jugular-venous lactate levels increased after rewarming (p<0.05) and corresponded to the appearance of a anaerobic metabolism.	0.8562316850673664
These data demonstrate significantly decreased levels of ptiO2 (brain tissue oxygenation) and CBF (oxygen supply) during and after rewarming from DHCA.	0.9903398729768838
The induced impairment of recovery persists after rewarming and generates a temporary low-flow situation with delayed brain tissue reoxygenation on the cellular/mitochondrial level.	0.9551265921974533
Thus, a direct influence on brain functional recovery by the active cooling and rewarming process about the bloodstream during CPB, resulting in disturbed tissue blood redistribution, mitochondrial dysfunction and/or excessive cerebral oxygen consumption (compensation of an oxygen debt) is a possible explanation.	1.156973475139506
While initially advocated primarily for intrasurgical visualization (e. g., craniotomy), interventional MRI rapidly evolved into roles in image-guided localization for needle-based procedures, minimally invasive neurosurgical procedures, and thermal ablation of cancer.	1.0293145999376532
In this contest, MRI pulse sequences and scanning methods serve one of four primary roles: (1) speed improvement, (2) device localization, (3) anatomy/lesion differentiation and (4) temperature sensitivity.	1.0639621699839064

This review summarizes vascular tumours of skin and soft tissues that have been characterised in recent years.	1.0153649600230734
Although most of them are very rare, knowledge about their reproducible clinicopathological features is important to avoid diagnostic pitfalls.	1.060135387707004
These lesions include: bacillary angiomatosis, a vasoproliferative, pseudoneoplastic infection of immunocompromised patients caused by Rochalimaea henselae; tufted angioma, a variant of lobular capillary haemangioma characterised by a "cannon-ball" distribution of multiple lobules composed of packed capillaries and pericytes; microvenular haemangioma, a cutaneous haemangioma composed of thin-walled and irregularly branching blood vessels which dissect dermal collagen; sinusoidal haemangioma, a distinctive variant of cavernous haemangioma which may be located in the subcutaneous breast tissue and then may be confused with well-differentiated angiosarcoma; "hobnail haemangioma" (targetoid haemosiderotic haemangioma), a benign vascular tumour with a distinctive clinical targetoid appearance and a hobnail cytomorphology of the prominent endothelial tumour cells; retiform haemangioendothelioma, a very recently characterised low-grade angiosarcoma occurring most commonly in the extremities of adolescents which is characterised by arborising blood vessels arranged in a retiform pattern and lined by hobnail-like prominent endothelial cells; Kaposi-like infantile haemangioendothelioma, a borderline malignant tumour of infants mimicking Kaposi's sarcoma histologically; epithelioid angiosarcoma, a highly aggressive tumour in the spectrum of epithelioid vascular lesions which stains positively for endothelial and epithelial immunohistological markers; benign lymph-angioendothelioma (progressive lymphangioma), a benign, slowly growing macule or plaque which has to be distinguished from well-differentiated angiosarcoma and Kaposi's sarcoma; and lymphangiomatosis of the limbs, a poorly recognised angiomatosis occurring in young patients and limited mainly to the limbs with a favourable prognosis.	1.0294569683718744

Experimental animal models of ventricular arrhythmias have been developed to investigate the mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis in man.	1.151383174440383
Ventricular arrhythmias associated with ischaemia and infarction often cannot be elucidated by clinical studies on patients because those arrhythmias are potentially lifethreatening and their occurrence is unpredictable.	0.9672303770758627
Because of additional experimental procedures and techniques that can be used in the animal laboratory, such as microelectrode recording of transmembrane action potentials and high-density optical and electrical activation mapping, animal models have provided information that cannot be obtained from clinical studies.	1.0933771954986322
Studies on animal models have provided new ideas and hypotheses that have been tested in clinical studies and that have been found to be true for clinical arrhythmias.	1.1205775251572279
Animal models have enabled the mechanisms of fibrillation and defibrillation to be understood and new therapeutic concepts to be developed.	0.9749962522359309
The purpose of this article is to briefly review some animal models of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation.	1.003561767758047
Some contributions that these animal studies have made to our understanding of ventricular tachyarrhythmias will be discussed.	0.9757170087335061
Because of the clinical importance of coronary artery disease this article concentrates on those arrhythmias caused by myocardial ischaemia and infarction.	1.1332821896377419
The authors report a rare, recently diagnosed and atypical mishap during one-lung ventilation (OLV) via a double lumen tube (DLT) and left-sided thoracotomy: an ipsilateral pneumothorax during ventilation of the right lung.	1.0791635318810417
This occurred in a 63-year-old patient with chronic obstructive airway disease who was scheduled for urgent repair of a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm.	0.9712643993149654
Anaesthesia and surgery were uneventful until aortic cross-clamping release.	0.8353054926285429
The common presentation of increased intrathoracic extrapleural pressure owing to a pneumothorax in patients with mechanically ventilated lungs is a rapid decrease in oxygen saturation, followed or paralleled by haemodynamic deterioration.	1.0194568998430518
Although the above presentation could be seen in this case, the diagnosis of a tension pneumothorax was delayed twice.	1.1226901430654763
First, symptoms were initially obscured by haemodynamic changes resulting from a head-down tilt and aortic declamping.	0.9606368908394677
Second, since the lack of consolidation after aortic declamping focused attention on the airway problems, complications resulting from the use of a DLT were primarily considered.	1.2019657152582057
In particular, since breathing sounds were detectable initially, malposition or torsion of the DLT had to be excluded by fibre-optic bronchoscopy, which involved a further delay.	1.083377916016092
Finally, two observations led to the diagnosis of a right-sided tension pneumothorax: (1) bullae of the contralateral lung, detected during thoracotomy; (2) the finding that ventilation of both lungs and the left lung subsequently increased arterial (SaO2) and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) and the circulatory status, but ventilation of the right lung caused a deterioration.	1.2873165959767758
Chest radiography and insertion of a chest tube with drainage of air, thereafter, validated our hypothesis.	0.9014868540800899
The time course of oxygen desaturation during OLV and tension pneumothorax was as severe as expected; the time course of haemodynamic deterioration, however, appeared quicker and had more impact than expected.	1.029444213807444
Assuming that mediastinal deviation was not hindered by contralateral intrathoracic pressure during thoracotomy, we believed that circulation should be depressed later or to a lesser extent in patients with an intraoperative pneumothorax.	1.1000714024601894
Yet, during thoracotomy, decrease in cardiac filling and output during tension pneumothorax in OLV obviously results primarily from the immovability of the mediastinum owing to mediastinal fixation and is at least as decisive as the contralateral intrathoracic pressure in closed-chest patients.	1.0697114972088744
In summary, a tension pneumothorax during one-lung ventilation and thoracotomy is a rare, but disastrous complication during the use of a DLT, which has not, to our knowledge, been reported previously.	1.1874446972737127
We recommend that tension pneumothorax be added to the list of complications and problems during OLV by the use of a DLT, especially in patients with structural lung diseases.	1.012527125560822
The intramedullary hip screw system Classic-Nail and the Dynamic Hip Screw (DHS) were evaluated in a prospective-randomized clinical trial for operative treatment of trochanteric femur fractures.	1.0295943029391859
Hundred and ten geriatric patients (mean age 82 years) were runningly included in the study (56 Classic Nail, 54 DHS).	1.244275939215051
No significant differences between the two study groups were observed with regard to treatment and follow-up data.	1.0559173666700876
With the Classic-Nail one complete femur shaft fracture and one incomplete fracture occured at the tip of the nail intraoperatively and could successfully be fixed with cerclage wires.	0.9100123566311178

Introduction: The goal of this study was to compare contrast-enhanced T1-weighted Flash and Turbo-Flash sequences with conventional spin-echo sequences as a basis for planning high-precision radiotherapy.	0.9594478296083826
Methods: A total of 25 consecutive patients with different intracranial tumors and a disrupted blood-brain barrier were studied.	1.0940663088173397
T1-weighted Flash, Turbo-Flash and conventional spin-echo images were evaluated after controlled 30-s infusion of 0.1 mmol/kg body weight of Gd-DTPA.	1.0231429347572696
The evaluation of the three sequences included the measurement of the signal- and contrast-to-noise ratios, the visual inspection of the tumors and artifacts, and the measurement of tumor size.	1.2239058249042978
Results: The signal- and contrast-to-noise ratios were significantly (P < 0.05-0.01) lower for Flash and Turbo-Flash than for conventional spin-echo sequences.	1.0294944757071265
However, visual inspection of the contrast-enhancing tumors revealed in 23 and 24 of 25 lesions on Flash and Tu-rbo-Flash images, respectively, good or very good tumor visibility when compared with conventional spin-echo images with a reduction of imaging time by a factor of 7-8.	1.1787547743747466
Flash and Turbo-Flash sequences were more prone to susceptibility artifacts, conventional spin-echo sequences more to pulsation artifacts in the posterior fossa.	0.8577305499046306
Tumor sizes were comparable in all three techniques.	0.8842789055465947
Conclusion: At present, conventional spin-echo images are superior to fast Flash and ultrafast Turbo-Flash sequences as a basis for accurate target volume definition in high-precision radiotherapy.	0.9511332314912017
However, fast Flash and Turbo-Flash images may be a practicable alternative to conventional spin-echo images for tumors in the posterior fossa or in patients unable to tolerate a stereotactic fixation device.	1.1137309363740202
Despite some limitations, Turbo-Flash sequences enable fast dynamic MR imaging combined with an acceptable morphology, which may be sufficient for target volume planning in high-precision radiotherapy.	0.9769000019986938

Cell nucleic acids and nucleotides are continuously synthesised, degraded and salvaged.	0.7137266422531736
The body's pools derive from three potential sources: synthesis de novo, salvage (recycling of preformed bases) and the diet.	1.000598272462583
It is generally accepted that de novo synthesis of both purines and pyrimidines from amino acid precursors is capable of supporting the cellular needs for nucleic acid synthesis.	0.7584364550790439
When protein intake is decreased or in situations in which there are a high demand of nucleotides synthesis (after gut injury, after surgical trauma, sepsis, rapid growth: pregnancy or newborn infants, etc.)	1.0118736406266338
some tissues with a rapid turnover (gut and immune system) may increase the salvage of exogenous nucleotides coming from the diet.	0.9789544991072137
Therefore, nucleotides may become conditionally essential nutrients.	1.0757855624088726
This article discusses the possible beneficial effects of dietary nucleotides on small intestine (maturation and recovery) and gut microflora, lipid and hepatic metabolism and on the immune system.	0.9859070822425073
Human milk is the best source of nucleotides for young infants and the nucleotide/nucleoside profile of it shows a substantial predominance for pyrimidines as compared to purines.	0.9775191278824542
Moreover, pyrimidine nucleotides seem to be better preserved in breast milk during storage in the breast and during digestion in the small intestine and they are more absorbed and incorporated into tissue RNA, as compared to purine ones.	1.1251178230155099
Additional research should be done to improve the design of nucleotides supplemented infant formulas.	1.006837155868976
This includes: 1) to investigate in vivo if the incorporation of dietary nucleotides in tissue RNA is enhanced in situations of stress or rapid growth and 2) to study the biological effects of individually administered purine and pyrimidine nucleotides.	1.154302485325493
Parkinson's disease (PD) causes significant expense for the national health care system due to its chronic progressive course, the duration of the disease, the high prevalence and the devastating prognosis.	1.1318043141721503
In Germany more than DM 320 million are spent for drugs to alleviate parkinsonian symptoms.	0.7249285133233213
The aim of this study was to calculate the economic burden of PD by assessing direct medical costs.	0.8760870146329395
Forty patients suffering from idiopathic PD were interviewed at an office of neurological specialists and at an outpatient movement disorder clinic about their use of health care resources 3 months prior to the study.	1.0011123957322456
The total annual costs reported were DM 14,500, consisting of DM 6500 for drug therapy and DM 8000 for other medical services, including hospital inpatient care (DM 5600), outpatient care (DM 700), medical sundries (DM 1100) and physiotherapy (DM 600).	1.1752266087704808
The costs were positively correlated to the extent of the disease (Hoehn and Yahr stage; HY) and the occurrence of motor fluctuations/dyskinesias.We found that both drug-therapy expenses and total medical costs doubled from HYI to HYIV.	1.0722267248777213
The rarely employed s.c. therapy with apomorphine additionally increased the costs of drug therapy in HYV.	0.960462338267995
The occurrence of fluctuations/ dyskinesias also increased medical expenses by approximately a factor of two.	0.6746443943973142
Indirect burden due to increased days off of work, unemployment and earlier retirement are also significant in Parkinson's disease.	0.8334137393688535
This study oncludes that a treatment which could prevent or retard disease progression as well as a treatment that delays or reduces motor complications would not only ameliorate the situation of patients suffering from PD, but would also lead to significant reductions in cost for the national health care system.	0.99168452471606
The cryopreservation of human ovarian tissue is essentially intended to maintain fertility and endocrinological function in female cancer patients and female patients at increased risk of early menopause.	0.9760152801993984
After having been frozen and subsequently thawed, the tissue can, ideally, be transplanted to its original site, where it leads to spontaneous fertilisation.	1.094988808884633
Heterotopic transplantations are also discussed as autografts or xenotransplants in SCID mice.	0.7870674944700631
In addition to the use of whole tissue, the isolation of individual follicles and their in vitro maturation (IVM) are discussed.	1.123215506980223
As in the case of heterotopic transplantation of ovarian tissue, pregnancy can only be achieved in these cases by in vitro fertilisation of the matured oocytes.	1.1497594110110816
Although considerable progress has already been made in both directions, these are still, at the present time, experimental processes that require further in-depth investigation prior to widespread clinical application.	1.0580241831198551
In addition to its use following the cryopreservation of ovarian tissue, IVM of immature oocytes also plays a significant role in promoting current methods of assisted reproduction.	0.945298588838715
The successful maturation of immature oocytes could lead to improved assessment of the oocytes obtained by follicular puncture and to a reduction in the incidence and risk of ovarian stimulation.	1.0845623175473196
IVM is therefore expected to broaden the spectrum of individual treatment regimens as in the case of PCOS patients, for instance, increasing treatment efficacy by the additional acquisition of immature oocytes or by "rescuing" IVF cycles with unintentionally immature oocytes.	1.057530805279227

As a final result an unscientific era comes about, on which Karl Jaspers commented in 1945 that only this unscientific spirit had made National Socialism possible.	0.8971372976953823
Based on the good statistical results of German obstetrics compared to those of foreign countries, it is shown that our patients' demands for "gentle" obstetrics can be combined with the requirements of safe obstetrics.	1.0851070895054402
If the professional interests of doctors and midwives are joint together, "safe and gentle" obstetrics should result in the common goal of a healthy child and a happy mother.	1.0865551336187016
Objectives: Due to its unique pharmacokinetics, the new esterase-metabolised opioid remifentanil results in rapid post-anaesthesia recovery.	1.0199823519623639
The aim of this clinical investigation was to compare recovery times after remifentanil anaesthesia in combination with hypnotic concentrations of either propofol or isoflurane.	1.11577804824211

Methods: Patients (ASA status I-II) scheduled for elective arthroscopy were included in this trial.	0.9969913323668023
Without premedication in the morning, anaesthesia was induced identically in both groups: remifentanil bolus (1 µg/kg), start of remifentanil-infusion (0.5 µg/kg/min), followed immediately by propofol (ca.	1.212532643731856
For maintenance of anaesthesia remifentanil (0.25 µg/kg/min) was combined with either a propofol infusion of 0.1 mg/kg/min or 0.5 MAC isoflurane (=0.6 vol.%) in O2/air.	1.1354180675838152
Anaesthetic delivery was discontinued simultaneously with termination of surgery and recovery times were recorded.	0.9247480833091515
Results: A total of 40 patients were studied at random in two groups of 20 each with comparable demographic data and anaesthetic technique (Tables 1 and 2).	1.1119986789563
In both groups emergence was very rapid.	0.8417068515757182
Recovery times were significantly shorter for remifentanil-isoflurane than for remifentanil-propofol (Table 3): spontaneous ventilation 5.1 vs 8.1 min (P<0.05), extubation 5.5 vs. 8.6 min (P<0.02), post-anaesthesia recovery score >=9 of 10 points 6.2 vs 11.3 min (P<0.01), and arrival at PACU 16.2 vs 19.2 min (P<0.01).	1.101480929860435
Mild to moderate shivering was noted in 40% of all patients (9 cases following isoflurane, 7 following propofol).	1.1408203686125913
Conclusions: Using the manufacturer's recommended dosages, emergence after remifentanil anaesthesia is more rapid with 0.5 MAC isoflurane than with 0.1 mg/kg/min propofol.	1.158617629321862
These results are most probably due to the different pharmacological properties of both co-anaesthetics, especially the applied dosages, and to different interactions with remifentanil.	1.3004440558226824
Present clinical experience suggests that a further dose reduction, especially for propofol, is possible.	1.2627369185837916
For both remifentanil groups emergence was remarkably rapid between return of consciousness and the awake state (on-off phenomenon), which might contribute to post-anaesthesia safety.	1.106206462488486
Exposure of the skin to ultraviolet irradiation is an important risk factor for the development of malignant melanoma, with UVA possibly playing an important role.	1.1682098850788019
Hereditary factors are also relevant.	0.6612671307601506
In the dysplastic nevus syndrome a genetic instability has been shown by different methods.	1.042677786006329
In xeroderma pigmentosum the DNA repair defect is thought to be responsible for the high incidence of malignant melanoma.	0.8562422949615242
Frequent and non-random changes in certain chromosomes have been demonstrated in melanoma cells.	0.8903584655520489
These might contain sequences that control melanoma growth or melanoma suppressor genes.	0.6929401910479575
Especially the short arm of chromosome 9 is thought to contain one of these genes.	1.0053854276816308
This hypothesis is supported by a genetic linkage analysis in melanoma families and the demonstration of a germ line deletion of the locus 9p21 in a patient with eight primary melanomas.	1.0606085703897852
Changes in known tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes have also been reported in melanoma, but no consistent sequence of genetic events is known.	1.0757929900209602
Neuropsychological studies could demonstrate increased risk for impaired attention and short term memory as well as a general reduced information processing speed in childhood's epilepsy.	1.118944837127279
Up to now it is not totally understood if focal EEG-pathology represents a specific cognitive deficit strongly related to the corresponding hemisphere's functions or represents a less lateralized but more general cognitive deficit of both cerebral hemispheres.	0.984527011012593
In a sample of 44 pediatric patients with epilepsy we studied sequential and simultaneous cognitive information processing.	0.7592711861736223
As a major result a general decreased function in cognitive information processing (more sequential than simultaneous) has been found.	1.0656434772214696
There was no correlation with the localization of an EEG-Focus nor with the hand preference.	1.0624355912164964
According to previous studies patients with an increased number of medical drugs or with presence of neuroradiological lesions are at greatest risk for cognitive impairment.	1.0506817367560168
Our data indicate a possible affection of underlying metamemory functions.	0.7234481993111572
The aim of this prospective and randomized study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a reduced shock strength in transvenous implantable defibrillator therapy.	1.172987099359002
So far clinical data concerning the safety margin of the shock energy in ICD therapy do not exist.	0.8699396606463656
The shock energy tested during long-term follow-up in this study was twice the intraoperatively measured defibrillation threshold (DFT).	1.1431215971580797
A total number of 176 consecutive patients representing a typical cohort of ICD patients were evaluated.	0.9301228767195312
All patients received a non-thoracotomy lead system (CPI, Endotak 0070, 0090) and a biphasic cardioverter-defibrillator with the ability to store episodes (Cardiac Pacemakers Inc., Ventac TM PRx II, PRx III).	1.080104587789921
The intraoperative defibrillation threshold (DFT) was evaluated in a step-down protocol (15, 10, 8, 5 J) and hat to be <=15 J for inclusion into the study.	1.1229823366343574
The lowest effective energy terminating induced ventricular fibrillation had to be confirmed and was defined as DFT+ augmented defibrillation threshold.	0.9150300576749049
The DFT+ value was tested immediately after successful implantation, at discharge, and after a follow-up period of one year.	1.2183281763064089
Prior to implantation the patients were randomized into two groups.	1.0112901851550726
The energy of the first shock in the study group was programmed at twice DFT+ and in the control group at the maximum energy output (34 J).	1.2223286790020567
The efficacy of the first shock and its reproducibility in DFT testings and in spontaneous episodes during long-term follow-up of the study group were compared to those in the control group.	1.2312766205582315
A DFT+ value was found to be <=15 J in 166 of 176 patients (94%).	0.7693293431570059
The DFT+ in the study group was 9.6+/-3.2; in control group 10.1+/-.35 J.	1.1324626298563736
The prohability of successful defibrillation at DFT+ level after one year was 84%.	0.7782657985921178
The success rate of the first shock meant to terminate induced ventricular fibrillation (VF) was 99.5% in the study group (217 of 218 episodes) and 99% in the control group (201 of 203 episodes).	1.1840010900507751
During follow-up of 24+/-9 months spontaneous episodes in the study group, 83/86 (96.5) monomorphic ventricular tachycardias (MVT) and 38/40 (95%) VF-episodes were converted successfully by the 2x DFT+ shock.	1.2163726539454307
In the control group the first shock was successful in 151/156 (96.8%) spontaneous MVTs and in 30/33 (91%) VF episodes.	1.2429623672977714
The efficacy of the first shock was not influenced by clinical data such as the underlying cardiac disease, left ventricular function, ongoing antiarrhythmic therapy with amiodarone, or the number of spontaneous episodes per day or by the DFT itself.	1.1864948189347881
At a mean follow-up of two years there was no significant difference between the two groups concerning the incidence of sudden cardiac death (2.4% in the study group vs. 3.8% in the control group).	1.4399839773178098
In conclusion programming the first shock with the ICD lead system used in this study at 2x DFT+ is as efficient as a shock energy of 34 J in order to terminate induced and spontaneous episodes of VT/VF.	1.0930127732536692
Thus, the safety of ICD-therapy is not impaired when programming the shock energy at the 2x DFT+ value.	1.1145938393846055
Culpable deficits of the preoperative information cause a complete illegality of the whole medical intervention and lead to liability for any resulting damage.	0.9715024376057665
In cases of controversy it's the physician's due to prove the correct preoperative information.	0.9528943432371475
To reduce these liability-risks a computer based information system has been developed.	0.8515191049527734
With its help an working sheet is provided which is individually adjusted for the patient.	0.7605124673213208
Based upon this record the real preoperative information takes place.	0.7413206439814622
After the patient signed the record the physician keeps it at his disposal for proving the contents of the preoperative information.	0.9295080670041762
The conception's use over many years shows that overlooking essential aspects and misunderstanding can grossly be excluded for the patient and a high quality of information can be reached.	1.0548968821695737
In vitro culture of peritoneal explants of neonatal rats after previous application of agents simulating wound antisepsis is a sensitive screening method for the determination of the tissue compatibility of local wound antiinfectives.	1.0037117397985393
Two test models are differentiated: (1) separated peritoneal explants as a model for chronic or deep wounds and (2) peritoneum in situ in the experimental animal with subsequent extraction and cultivation of the explants.	1.012595817549356
Considering the present state of knowledge the following conclusions can be drawn regarding antisepsis of wounds: Lavasept (0.1 %) may be classified as the agent of choice for deep and chronic wounds, for drip-suck irrigation and for antiinfective lavage of body cavities inclusively for peritoneal lavage (0,05 %).	1.1714939095492416
Taurolidin is antiseptically effective in long term application ( > 6 h), and because of its antitoxic effect as well as lack of cytotoxicity it is especially suitable for peritoneal lavage.	1.038813062362466
Betaisodona solution is very well suited for superficial contaminated wounds and can be used in a dilution of 1 : 10 for short-term rinsing of deep wounds, including body cavities but not for peritoneal lavage.	1.1678499233863127
Ethanol causes no inhibition of explant growth and therefore retains its importance in wound antisepsis.	0.846880399348384
Pain is a widely occurring disturbance of well-being and has serious consequences for the quality of life of patients suffering from acute or chronic pain.	1.0513391549344335
Thus, pain makes high demands on the health system.	1.1484922795099832
For the first time in the Federal Republic of Germany the National Health Interview and Examination Survey allows to make representative statements concerning the prevalence of pain, its intensity, frequency, duration and localisation.	0.9874772819214984
Furthermore, the results enable to differentiate according to age, gender, and social classes.	1.1777101760478903
The SF-36, used as an instrument to measure health related quality of life, has been employed to demonstrate the overwhelming significance of pain for the well-being of the population.	1.1096525195286588
In this publication the connection between certain disease syndromes like migraine and arthrosis and the prevalence of different qualities of pain is investigated.	0.9617400364051248
Additional more complex evaluation of the epidemiological data on pain are in preparation.	1.0047503978283299
In order to get an effective therapy of Tinea capitis drug must penetrate into the follicles.	0.8607238900350573
This can not be obtained exclusively by local treatment so that a combination with systemic therapy is necessary.	1.0447372826379835

Death may occur while a fleeing or resisting suspect is taken into custody by the police.	0.815263518811395
We report about this type of acute death in two males.	1.0887906111177388
In both cases, a cocaine intoxication was taken as the cause of death despite an initial suspicion of a direct association between the death and police measures (e.g.	0.9276931297885779
neck compression or "headlock", chest compression).	1.1628746074172762
From the Institute's autopsy material we selected another 12 cases with monointoxication by cocaine as the cause of death of as a secondary finding for comparison.	0.9015179235568408
Of the 12 cases 5 were gunshot injuries and 4 were classified as suicide.	0.8641718958591602
The analysis suggested an increased willingness to apply force against themselves or others under the influence of cocaine.	0.7826428014700786
In both cases, cardiac arrest occurred suddenly and unexpectedly for all those involved and who were unaware of any acute life-threatening situation because of the extreme attempts of the suspects to flee or resist arrest.	1.0223766475478313
Attention should be given to these types of cases during the training of police officers.	1.005518839963964
Abstract  Hepatitis C antibodies have been detected in more then half of all autopsies of drug-related deaths in a 2-year period since November 1995 in Aachen, Germany.	1.1562131003840026
It was of interest whether there is a risk of HCV transmission from the corpses.	1.0424375131803258
The presence of HCV-RNA indicates infectiosity in the living but this may be different post-mortem.	1.0213343433779558
To our knowledge no case of HVC infection from a corpse has been reported so far.	1.072518236306506
Non-traumatic duodenocaval fistulae are rare, but may be the source of massive gastrointestional bleeding with associated fever and sepsis.	0.972562605138283
These fistulae result from penetrating duodenal peptic ulcers or right nephrectomy and subsequent radiation to the upper abdomen.	0.8103884631116557
The outcome depends on early diagnosis and surgery before a potentially fatal hemorrhage occurs.	0.9577060974832896
The therapy of choice includes closure of the fistula and repair of the duodenum and inferior vena cava.	0.9324494643128111
We describe the seventh case with radiogenic duodenal ulcer.	0.9329111169099189
Gastrointestinal bleeding occurred 10 years after radical nephrectomy and radiation (60 Gy).	0.9803832416626551
The patient survived following partial pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple).	0.7548940480931324
Purpose: Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) induces variable functional deficits depending on the grade of vascular occlusion and its localisation.	1.0695064378261623
Theses deficiences are not easily defined by visual acuity measurements.	0.8038184240321982
However, microperimetry offers topical mapping of retinal function, allowing precise documentation of the intensity and dimension of retinal functional loss in BRVO.	1.1494577612045345
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is rare but beset with a high mortality rate.	0.9412355055606918
In recent years, however, a trend towards higher survival rates has been observed.	0.8763114188202414
High inspiratory oxygen concentrations, large tidal volumes, and high peak inspiratory airway pressures applied during mechanical ventilation have been identified as harmful to the lung and can contribute to the progression of ARDS.	1.0942014665354458
This had led to reconsideration of the sequelae of ventilatory therapy.	0.7183875530522349
Mechanical ventilation and other adjunctive strategies in ARDS have changed from the conventional approach aiming at normalisation of physiological ventilatory parameters to an elaborated approach that intends to protect the ventilated lung, prevent oxygen toxicity, recruit the infiltrated atelectatic and consolidated lung and reduce the anatomical and alveolar dead space.	0.9124359427586481
This new approach consists of various forms of pressure-controlled mechanical ventilation with PEEP and permissive hypercapnia, body position changes, and inhalation of nitric oxide.	0.9808132071706801
Should these procedures fail to improve impaired gas exchange, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is an additional therapeutic option.	0.8212352252671037
None of these therapeutic procedures, however, has been tested against traditional standard treatment in a classical randomised controlled trial.	1.1913468137325616
The following review focuses on the latest insights into the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of ARDS.	0.9720611471288265
Femoral neck fractures are frequent fractures of the elderly.	1.0662827411668332
They can be treated by the use of dynamic hip screws, lag screws, bipolar hemiprotheses or total hip replacement.	0.9231761353961194
The results are markedly influenced by the timing of the operation and the choice of the implant.	1.167511499136201
Using the Garden classification of femoral neck fracture we demonstrate a different therapeutic approach according to Garden stadium I-IV.	0.8893757606501242
Stool frequency after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is about 5/day after adaptation during the first year.	1.1538433173452345
It depends on stool volume and pouch capacity, not on the design of the pouch.	1.0301909947116574
In most cases evacuation is spontaneous and as complete as in healthy rectum.	0.8965170571770378
67 % of patients are perfectly continent, while 19 % have to wear pads due to intermittent leakage.	1.3980811450626651
Complete incontinence is reported in 0-4 % of the patients.	0.9201612155046307
Preservation of the anal transitional zone by the double-stapling technique does not improve functional results when compared to endoanal mucosectomy or intersphincteric resection.	0.8848970495549111
Impairment of continence is caused by damage of the internal sphincter with consecutive decrease of the pouch-anal pressure gradient.	1.0671774729291548
Despite altered reflex activity, stool discrimination is preserved in most patients.	0.729475722771764

Thirty-seven patients with chronic sinus pilonidalis were treated after total excision by Dufourmentel flap.	1.0142364136841773
We saw seroma complications in three and wound infections in two cases.	0.896386259454185
Patients stayed in hospital 6.3 days on an average and were able to work after 2.5 weeks.	1.2594307807425194

We have not seen a return to sinus problems in any of this cases.	0.9358773621495395
We describe a patient who was admitted to hospital because of hypoglycemic convulsions at the age of 6 months.	0.990358275363131
Diagnostics revealed that the hypoglycemic episodes were caused by glycogen synthase deficiency.	0.8080720014754041
Glycogen synthase deficiency its a rare cause of fasting hypoglycemia in childhood associated with normal production of ketone bodies.	0.8533157920259885
It is characterized by supranormal increase of glucose and lactate in blood after a meal or an oral glucose tolerance test.	0.8363825863907597
Diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of a reduced activity of glycogen synthase in liver tissue, and lately also by identification of pathogenic mutations in the glycogensynthase gene (GYS2-gene).	0.9498277612160574
Hypoglycemic episodes can be prevented by offering frequent protein-rich meals during the day and a late evening meal with uncooked corn starch.	0.9090869518278616
Although most subacromial decompressions are performed arthroscopically, rotator cuff repair is still performed using an open or mini-open procedure.	0.8893402021490093
Arthroscopic techniques have improved in the last decade, however, so that rotator cuff repair can also be performed arthroscopically.	1.2232733326341116
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a well-established method for the diagnosis of diseases of the heart and the great vessels.	1.160574575172816
Almost 20% of all patients cannot be completely examined by transthoracic echocardiography.	1.028404946003941
In this patient group, MRI can be used as a second line technique to provide important diagnostic information not obtainable by echocardiography.	1.055649510178423
However, there are clinical problems for which MRI may be used as the first line technique such as complex congenital heart disease, diseases of the great vessels, pericardial disease or cardiac tumors.	1.285580979815213
MRI is undergoing rapid technical improvement and this will further improve the diagnostic utility of the technique, especially in patients with coronary artery disease.	0.9128653719007895
In the last 7 years we have performed 220 infrainguinal vein bypasses associated with critical limb ischemia.	0.9885720893171226
All patients were prospectively controlled in a follow-up program 3 - 72 months postoperatively.	1.142357555759261
The patients were divided into two groups: patients with diabetes mellitus (35%, group 1) and patients without diabetes mellitus (65%, group 2).	1.2871563881474728
There was no difference in sex, age or localization of distal anastomosis (supra- or infragenicular) between the two groups.	1.0623501574466327
The primary and the primary-assisted patency rates were not statistically different after 60 months.	0.9478281063706286
There was a significant difference in limb salvage.	0.9989169929567976
The limb salvage of group 1 was 75% after 60 months, while the limb salvage of group 2 was 95% (P = 0.0045).	1.1018175075899683
The rate of major amputations was significantly higher in group 1 (15.6%) than in group 2 (4.9%, P = 0.007).	1.327806864876503
The indication for amputation was persistent foot infection.	0.7263978974987159
A 24-year-old woman with lymph vessel dysplasia had experienced a progressive edema of her legs since her second year of life and progressive facial edema for the past year.	1.0226670886792733
She also had telangiectasias and papules on the background of a diffuse erythema as well as marked seborrhea on her face.	0.9083355392602073
Histopathological examination of a representative facial lesion revealed a granulomatous dermatitis with periadnexal distribution mainly consisting of lymphocytes and histiocytes.	0.8511696458572463
In addition, there was a moderate fibrosis of the dermis with numerous mast cells.	1.1343975161993136
By duplex ultrasound, a diagnosis of a massive edema of the legs without evidence for chronic venous insufficiency was made.	1.1700238950861501
The clinical and histopathological findings were consistent with solid persistent erythema and edema of the face associated with rosacea and lymph vessel dysplasia.	0.9850452432555556
The chronic course, absence of serological abnormalities and nonspecific histopathological features as well as resistance to therapy are the most important diagnostic cirteria of this disease also known as Morbihan's disease.	1.0968886419949215
The cervical spine is an extremely complex functional unit and has always been the subject of impassioned discussions among surgeons, orthopedic specialists and neurologists.	0.973092407204674
In the presence of injuries affecting this section of the spine, which sometimes have grave consequences - including implications for legal insurance aspects, neurologists are usually at the end of the line when it comes to diagnosis and treatment.	1.0653011195303608
In fact, in view of the clinical and technical neurophysiological options available to neurologists, it would be desirable for them to be involved as early as possible.	1.1265419294101637
In this paper the relative value of neurology, compared with orthopedics and surgery, in the diagnosis and treatment of whiplash injury to the cervical spine is discussed.	1.209469493108937
The newer options available - particularly in neurophysiology - are highlighted, as are the differential diagnosis and problems concerned with official expert assessments, which also involve other specialties.	1.3678192573343637
A 19-year-old male patient with chronic cutaneous leishmaniosis was treated topically with paromomycin sulphate (15%) and methylbenzethonium chloride (12%) in petrolatum album.	1.1140957645375507
After application twice daily for two periods of 32 and 44 days the lesions were completely healed.	0.9169319389547221
Previous treatment for 9 months with ketoconazole (400 mg/day) together with the topical application of thiabendazole (2.5%) in base had been unsuccessful.	1.0929382974621016

The debate about EST ("empirically supported therapy") is being drawn upon to show that the list of criteria for differentiation of effective and ineffective therapies is not warranted.	1.1770362833344457
Scientific or economic dominance claims might have deteriorating effects in the professional fields, as well-known researchers meanwhile fear.	1.1236894193065448
In economic contexts the aim is efficiency, in professional contexts it is quality.	1.0777981377130468
To develop own quality measures has the aim to promote the profession as a learning organization.	0.8913782523604045
This could help to rise professionals' self-confidence.	0.7201597409390057
Procalcitonin is the propeptide of calcitonin devoid of hormonal activity.	0.6125309813739904
Normally, procalcitonin is produced in the C-cells of the thyroid gland.	0.4948816815879654
In healthy humans procalcitonin levels are undetectable (<0.1 ng/ml).	1.2043368239882795
During severe generalized infections (bacterial, parasitic and fungal) with systemic manifestations, procalcitonin levels may rise up to 100 ng/ml.	1.0271041112774706
In contrast, severe viral infections or inflammatory reactions of non-infectious origin do not or very moderately increase procalcitonin levels.	1.071252196345436
The exact site of procalcitonin production is not exactly known but even large amounts of procalcitonin released during infections do not lead to an increase in plasma calcitonin level or activity.	0.9096275563412148
In this retrospective study, oncologic and functional results of 24 patients treated for glomus jugulare tumor stages C and D are reported.	0.9894685669157813
The surgical approach used was a combined transmastoid-transcervical approach, which was modified according to individual tumor growth.	1.1801422826714607
As needed, this was combined with a transtemporal or retrosigmoid approach.	1.054523977895847
Complete tumor removal resulted in a cure rate of 100%.	0.9237897524025198
Surgically induced cranial nerve palsies developed in 38% of the patients.	0.7803757442062826
In 54% of cases it was possible to retain middle ear function.	1.3113968232038073
Seven patients had incomplete tumor removal requiring postoperative irradiation, with tumor progression occurring in 2 patients.	1.0230024881344455
Radical tumor removal was modified by efforts to reduce mutilating resections.	0.8030595175885714
These results show that individually tailored and combined multidirectional surgical approaches can allow total tumor removal to be performed with lower morbidity.	1.0527724253723925
Electron beam CT, which does not require mechanical movement of an X-ray tube, has a temporal resolution which exceeds that of conventional computed tomography by a factor of about ten.	1.1309643993925413
Axial images of the heart can be acquired within 50 to 100 ms with a spatial resolution below 0.5 mm2 and permit precise visualization of all cardiac structures.	1.074316276095968
ECG-triggered acquisition of 30 to 40 axial images (3 mm slice thickness) in a short inspiratory breathhold allows one to sample a 3-dimensional volume data set which covers the complete heart.	1.190414029980048
Overall acquisition times are approximately 30 to 50 seconds.	0.7638911180853774
While electron beam CT in general permits a complete cardiac investigation, including morphology, function, and perfusion, the method's most important application is non-invasive imaging of the coronary arteries.	1.0787772116179162
Without contrast enhancement, coronary calcification by EBCT currently constitutes the most sensitive non-invasive marker for the presence even of very early forms of coronary atherosclerosis.	1.0088238298859975
Intraveneous injection of contrast agent during image acquisition additionally permits the selective visualization of the coronary artery lumen and detection of significant stenoses.	0.9775167498869807
This method is especially well suited in the follow-up of coronary interventions and coronary bypass grafting.	1.1837972458222077
Breathhold and movement artifacts, superposition of coronary arteries and veins, as well as severe coronary calcifications currently constitute the method's main problems.	0.8605872616838938
In spite of these limitations, electron beam CT has been shown to permit clinically valuable non-invasive investigations of the coronary arteries, which may be further refined as technology progresses.	1.1104078447745998
Despite the availability of diagnostic modalities such as transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging up to 30% of patients with acute aortic dissection remain undiagnosed before death.	1.0106432941837933
A novel immunoassay of serum smooth muscle myosin as a potential diagnostic tool for the detection of aortic dissection.	0.8840697907846014
The immunoassay was applied in two patients with an acute chest pain syndrome but no initial suspicion of aortic disease.	1.1350427747574865
In both patients myocardial ischemia was ruled out by laboratory, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic examination.	0.9119068874543856
In the first patient both dilation of the aortas and long-standing arterial hypertension were known; however, it was not before 48h until dissection was suspected and a spiral-CT was performed demonstrating a localized ascending aortic dissection.	1.1620909872923508
At this time (48 h after onset of symptoms) the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain concentration in the serum was close to normal.	1.1485766208147974
In the other patient there was neither a suggestive history nor any clinical sign of aortic dissection.	0.896799887527222
Widening of the abdominal was the key to the incidental diagnosis of a clinically unsuspected type B dissection.	1.1624993535895436
The serum test 12 h after onset of pain revealed elevated (diagnostic) serum levels of smooth muscle myosin heavy chains.	0.9155774327168156
Recurrent abdominal pain is found in 10-25% of school-aged children, thus being one of the most frequent complaints in childhood.	1.2376931743263087
Despite that, our knowledge about this syndrome is still very incomplete.	1.1425228654405832
Following oral surgery, there are sometimes disturbances in wound healing.	1.0738944868806015
It was the aim of this investigation to look for relationships between the composition of saliva and disturbed wound healing.	0.9748779286846249
Resting as well as stimulated fasting whole saliva was collected from 96 patients (19 to 53 years of age) prior to oral surgery.	0.9382643698206473
Flow rate, pH, standard bicarbonate, total buffer bases, peroxidase, lysozyme, thiocyanate, secretory immunoglobulin A, lactoferrin, total protein, tissue type plasminogen activator, and plasminogen activator inhibitor were determined.	0.9743677664941371
The salivary data of eight patients who suffered from disturbed wound healing were compared to the data of 20 randomly selected patients with normal wound healing.	1.0836740571338328
Patients with disturbed wound healing revealed increased activities and secretion rates for peroxidase in resting saliva.	0.7349977564146277
In stimulated saliva, decreased secretion rates for thiocyanate and total protein were found.	0.8663658437287266
Not a single salivary factor was able to discriminate both groups of patients with sufficient accuracy, but with a combination of tissue type plasminogen activator, peroxidase, plus secretory immunoglobulin A measurements from resting whole saliva a clearly improved and acceptable discrimination of the two patient groups was possible.	1.0255995057905882
A discriminant function including six salivary factors could be used to completely separate both groups.	0.9131642822041254
Nuclear imaging methods provide noninvasive indexes of myocardial function, perfusion, and metabolism and are well accepted in clinical cardiology.	1.0548732141309636
Advances in prevention and treatment of cardiac disease have resulted in decreasing cardiovascular mortality in industrialized nations.	0.9476654548406981
The improvement in therapeutic options has increased the demand for diagnostic tests that might guide clinical decision making.	0.9171606204853185
Information beyond the pure anatomic characterization of coronary stenoses is required.	0.783502931579164
Nuclear imaging can be used for early detection and monitoring of the severity and extent of disease.	1.2517116311571084
The prognostic potential of such functional testing is being increasingly appreciated and used to guide therapy, thereby resulting in improvement of the quality and cost-effectiveness of the workup of patients with cardiovascular disease.	1.1843345669049072
Extensive clinical validation has resulted in growing acceptance of these techniques.	0.8966064786583182
Furthermore, ongoing improvement of imaging techniques and development of new radiopharmaceuticals will pave the way for disease-specific, molecular-targeted cardiac imaging in the future.	1.1736918566551429
Epidural anaesthesia for elective caesarean section can have advantages over general anaesthesia.	0.7613460269403005
The anaesthesiologist can avoid endotracheal intubation as well as fetal depression following placental transfer of systemic anaesthetics.	0.8783524006509457
However, despite reaching an effective blockade preoperatively, intraoperative discomfort and pain may occur during epidural anaesthesia with local anaesthetics alone, necessitating supplemental systemic analgesics or even conversion to general anaesthesia [21].	1.158447058416011
Addition of epidural fentanyl has been shown to improve onset and quality of perioperative analgesia without evident side effects for mother or newborn [24].	0.9883483845671218
Nevertheless, administration of epidural opioids before cord clamping is still hotly debated, some fearing maternal and or neonatal depression [6, 26].	1.1890647911817058
The aim of the present study was to investigate the quality of analgesia, associated side effects and the resulting maternal and neonatal plasma opiate concentrations after a single preoperative addition of 0.1 mg fentanyl to epidural bupivacaine analgesia in comparison to epidural bupivacaine analgesia alone.	1.1173642991761479
The quality of the morphological analysis of myocardial and coronary alterations depends essentially on the method chosen for the heart dissection.	1.0358863853822158
Even if previous postmortem coronary angioplasty is not feasible, the best results are obtained by transverse sectioning of the ventricles in a bread-loaf fashion subsequent to formalin-fixation and serial cross-sectioning of the coronary arteries, with decalcification in addition if necessary.	1.0492208061965167
The distribution pattern of disseminated myocardial necrosis, the longitudinal, circumferential and transmural extent of infarction, its age and sequelae and its correlation to the coronary supplying areas can be evaluated with better accuracy than by dissecting the heart chambers according to the flow of blood.	1.1274271215521279
Cross-sectioning of coronary arteries with preservation of their luminal shape allows proper examination of the degree and extent of luminal narrowing, plaque hemorrhage, parietal and occluding thrombi and the effects and complications of angioplastic procedures or bypass surgery.	1.0192769353070328
Transverse sectioning of the heart is a prerequisite for adequate examination following sudden cardiac death and short-term territorial ischemia.	0.9876934873973916
Full-thickness samples of the ventricular walls, taken systematically with respect to coronary narrowing and coronary supplying areas, enable identification of early myocardial damage.	0.9905585635840856
Total hip replacement is one of the most successful procedures in surgery.	1.1096759312520963
In Germany there is a great variety of cemented and uncemented implants with different principles of fixation.	0.9947683746926166
We reviewed the different principles, with particular reference to long-term clinical outcome, and discuss the most popular systems available in Germany.	1.094949833290157
Despite many new developments which have been made in the field of cementless hip replacement, cemented total hip arthroplasty will remain the "gold standard" until prospective long-term data (>15 years) of cementless systems become available.	1.1124971001813215
To summarize current knowledge on surgical therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and diverticulitis).	0.8846816887175415
Procalcitonin is a propeptide of calcitonin.	0.536879037547161
It is usually not detectable in healthy volunteers but appears in high concentrations in the serum of patients with severe bacterial, parasitic or fungal infection.	1.0596324228378493
In contrast, procalcitonin levels do not or only moderately increase during viral infections or during non-infectious systemic inflammatory states.	1.0724726082446818
Because of these properties, procalcitonin has been proposed to serve as a marker of severe infections and sepsis.	1.0918210435801046
Increased procalcitonin levels have recently been shown to indicate the severity of systemic infection with increasing specificity.	1.095168058321968
Normally, procalcitonin is produced in the C-cells of the thyroid gland.	0.4948816815879654
The origin of the high levels of procalcitonin in septic conditions is not fully understood.	0.9018583275484471
Although procalcitonin has drawn attention as a marker of severe systemic infections, a recent study suggests it may also be a mediator of sepsis.	1.054511668523999
More studies are needed to uncover the nature and pathophysiological role of this molecule.	0.8374927267709344
Fractures of the hand sceleton are common injuries.	0.961858271070629
These are or are associated with phalangeal fractures.	0.7256741833876191
Kirschner wires can be used for osteosynthesis, but can cause lesions of periphereal finger structures.	1.1874432198133549
The aim of our study was to record the incidence of lesions in peripherial structures of the fingers caused by retrograde crossed inserted Kirschner wires of 1.0, 1.25, 1.4 and 1.6 mm diameter into the middle and proximal phalanges of the long fingers and the proximal phalanx of the thumb of 120 fresh cadaver hands.	1.3673398327829087
We found an increase of insertion attempt frequency and an increasing number of lesions with increasing Kirschner wire diameter.	1.0430014474576976
Because of these findings Kirschner wires of 1.0 or 1.25 mm diameter should be prefered to prevent the periphereal functional finger structures.	1.0649644944505963
Fucosidosis, a rare lysosomal storage disease due to nearly complete deficiency of -L- fucosidase, was diagnosed in two unrelated male German patients who exhibited typical symptoms of this disorder including mental retardation, dysostosis multiplex, vacuolization of lymphocytes and progressive neurologic deterioration by the age of 3.2 and 4 years, respectively.	1.1287201752777576
In both cases, activity of -L-fucosidase in leukocytes and cultivated fibroblasts was negligible.	0.8740647918524885
DNA analysis revealed a nonsense mutation (G401X) in exon 7 of the fucosidase gene; this leads to a premature stop codon and C-terminal deletion of 61 amino acids from the protein.	0.9939950358206134
Discussion: On account of the mutation a unique PFlMI restriction site is obliterated; this simplifies molecular diagnosis of the G401X mutation.	1.0667788264200622
So far, the mutation G401X has not been found in any other population.	1.0817817468291557
The main reason for posttraumatic secondary brain damage is cerebral hypoxia.	0.817153412820942
Both, severity and duration of hypoxia are crucial in determining wether irreversible cerebral infarction will occur or not.	0.9074591613105712
For the clinical routine, the diagnosis of hypoxia is indirectly made by low CPP, low jugularvenous oxygen saturation (SjO2) or low tissue PO2.	1.136925217972758
To minimize misleading false negative SjO2, the CT-Approach for the side of monitorig and calculation of arterial-jugularvenous lactate content for detection of anaerobic metabolism is recommended.	1.0120734238809097
Targeted treatment of hypoxia according to the underlying cause is mandatory.	1.080561162271543
Primary goal is to increase cellular oxygen delivery by correction of low arterial oxygen content and elevation of regional CBF.	0.9715796841496872
Within the autoregulatory range decreasing CPP causes vasodilation and increasing CPP vasoconstriction with increasing or decreasing cerebral blood volume respectively.	0.8121460383573859
Initially elevation of the lower autoregulatory threshold often requires CPP 70 mmHg.	0.9658518288857595
Targeted treatment of intracranial hypertension must avoid decreasing CPP.	0.7147830216504769
In the early postrautmatic phase prevention of cerebral hypoxia relies on management of CBF by means of CPP and cerebral vascular resistance.	0.946377655047037
Thereafter targeted treatment of intracranial hypertension caused by cerebral edema and hypervolemia are increasingly important.	0.8563560889829592
Today, orthotopic liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for the end-stage of various liver diseases, and a 1-year survival rate of 80 % and a 5-year survival rate of 70 % in elective patients without tumor are reported in international surveys.	1.4000698217599021
The liver transplant programme of the Inselspital in Bern is small compared with international centres, which may raise questions about the results and the justification for such a programme.	1.1431493474199956
Over a period of 66 months, 62 liver transplantations were performed in 60 patients at the Inselspital.	1.0052814121057532
The hospital mortality was 3.3 %, and the 2.5-year overall survival rate was 92 % for elective cases without tumor.	1.4521880659831305
After a median follow-up of 30 months, 68 % of all patients were re-integrated in housework or full- or part-time in their profession, and 83 % were independent from the help of others.	1.2993847135993166
We conclude that a small liver transplant programme based only on routine resources can achieve results comparable to the international standards.	1.0263925234447564
Accidental hypothermia (AH) can be defined as an unintentional decrease in core temperature below 35  °C during cold exposure by individuals without intrinsic thermoregulatory dysfunction.	0.9322550931441218
Pathophysiological changes can be attributed both to the severity of hypothermia and to co-morbid factors such as trauma, submersion, intoxication and underlying diseases.	0.8850901815330263
In trauma victims stratified according to the Injury Severity Score, the factor hypothermia is considered to be a poor prognostic sign for survival.	1.0652692604795766
In these patients rewarming therapy should be applied as soon as possible.	0.9927653916707571
In the Utrecht University Hospital, adult patients with AH are managed according to an algorithm based on their presenting hemodynamic conditions.	0.9907319709422953
Patients with perfusing cardiac rhythms and systolic pressures over 80 mmHg will receive continuous arteriovenous rewarming (CAVR).	0.7754793766233367
Arrested and hemodynamically instable patients are treated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).	0.6490849679689435
In a 3-year period, 22 patients with AH were admitted to the emergency department.	1.0395970634616152
Fourteen patients had a trauma as the cause of hypothermia.	0.8863601657804966
Twenty patients were treated according to the algorithm (CAVR n = 18, CPB n = 2) and two patients were alternatively managed.	1.2402686422734464
Mortality in the CAVR group was 28 % and total mortality reached 32 %.	1.1890606606879117
Complications of CAVR are related to placement and removal of vascular catheters and may be severe in these patients with impaired coagulation.	1.0503030949606451
CAVR permits a good access to the (trauma-) patient and rewarming can be continued synchronously with diagnosis and treatment of various injuries.	1.268477870080819
The grading of long-tubular-bone pseudarthrosis depends on the biological reaction or lack of reaction in pseudarthrosis or non-unions.	0.9744880089483893
Hypertrophic and oligotrophic pseudarthrosis belongs to biologically reacting non-unions, whereas non-reacting non-unions are necrotic pseudarthrosis and defective non-unions with partial decline or complete destruction of cortical substance.	0.9653323287559824
Pseudarthrosis is a serious disturbance or disorder within the regulation cycle in fracture healing, which consists of osteoregeneration, osteovascularization and stabilization.	0.9429397134596673
The causes and underlying reasons for disturbance of this regulation cycle are primarily massive destruction of the biological and functional very important unity of periost, cortical substance and medullary space.	1.0037036504858743
This can occur from trauma, but it happens more often from surgical procedures that do not take the biological principles of bone-healing into account.	1.1487779518022305
Surgical strategies and interventions that respect the importance of periosteal tissue, cortical tissue and medullary space do fill the biological principles of fracture-healing and fracture union.	0.9545633288025234
Background: Clonidine, an 2-receptor agonist, has been reported to prolong the blocking actions of local anaesthetics.	1.436723004045582
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of spinally injected clonidine on the duration of spinal anaesthesia by mepivacaine and on the postoperative demand for analgesics.	0.9030460819010098
Differentiation of an elevated, repeatedly determined platelet count (>=500x109/l) includes the discrimination between reactive causes generated by a variety of underlying conditions and a neoplastic myeloprolifera-tive disorder (CMPD).	0.9567104087104814
In addition to clinical findings, the evolution of laboratory data during follow-up and histology of the bone marrow exerts a significant diagnostic impact.	1.201410598559635
Characteristic features are not only expressed by hematopoiesis, but also by the myeloid stromal compartment.	1.165667578606967
While the megakaryocyte-rich subtype of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and the 5q- syndrome (MDS) are dominated by abnormal micromegakaryocytes, in polycythemia vera (PV) this cell lineage reveals a pleomorphous appearance.	1.0110376398795986
In essential thrombocythemia (ET), a prevalence of giant megakaryocytes with deeply lobulated (staghorn-like) nuclei may be encountered.	0.9662420238494269
A clear-cut discrimination of ET from early (hypercellular) stages of idiopathic (primary) myelofibrosis (IMF) presenting with thrombocythemia becomes possible, provided the conspicuous atypical features of megakaryopoiesis characterizing the latter entity are taken into account.	0.9411383650812307
Moreover, CML displays a predominance of the granulocytic lineage whereas PV shows a panmyelosis or trilineage proliferation, involving erythropoiesis, in particular.	1.0962478551791486
In contrast, erythropoiesis is markedly reduced in CML and to a lesser degree also in IMF.	1.0374975386381056
In CMPDs extreme values of iron deposits may be found, ranging from a total lack (PV) to minor amounts (CML) and a normal staining reaction (ET).	1.1260708833354651
Similar results are exhibited regarding reticulin fibrosis, which is usually not present in ET, rarely observed in PV and detectable to a variable degree in CML and IMF.	1.0749175565694962
Nevus cell aggregates in lymph nodes are uncommon.	0.8295083350098913
This benign phenomenon may be difficult to differentiate from metastatic neoplasia.	0.7981583678464492
We report the case of a 56-year-old patient who underwent breast biopsy, followed by radical mastectomy including lymphadenectomy.	0.9985995091374545
Histological examination revealed solid cell aggregates as foreign tissue in the capsule of 1 of 11 identified lymph nodes devoid of any keratin immunoreaction.	0.9643999963690569
Strong immunohistological staining for the S-100 protein confirmed the diagnosis of nevus cell aggregates.	1.0541660083161868
We report the case of a seven year old girl presenting with varicella infection 14 days after kidney transplantation.	0.8795078096165426
Cramp-like abdominal pain and a subileus were the first symptoms.	1.0421340366706997
Enemas did not relieve the symptoms, and the following laparotomoy with Tenckhoff catheter explantation was performed which did not reveal any pathologic abnormalities.	1.0661377664712446
Two days after the beginning of abdominal pain an unspecific papular rash developed.	0.8244794256893603
Further twelve hours later skin vesicles appeared and varicella-zoster virus was isolated from their fluid.	0.7855395381157515
Despite high dose administration of aciclovir and varicella-zoster immune globulin further visceral dissemination occurred and finally lead to liver failure and intravascular coagulopathy.	0.8325632317509661
The patient died 18 days after kidney transplantation from multiorgan failure.	0.8752920153480512
The unconscious patient presents an challenging emergency in the intensive care unit.	0.5979149496112944
Patient evaluation and treatment must occur simultaneously.	0.7220931092960399
After checking vital signs, deciding about cardiopulmonary resuscitation or intubation, an intravenous line must be established, blood samples collected and glucose and thiamine should be given.	0.9960555292125811
The physical and neurological examination should be performed in a efficient way and must consider the following eight points: best reaction to loud commands, best motor reaction to noxious stimuli, respiratory pattern, size and reactions of pupils, eye movements, corneal and blink reflex, meningismus, muscle tone and deep tendon reflexes.	1.0071164066735325
With this approach it is possible to formulate a working diagnosis, and the appropriate diagnostic steps can be performed.	1.2884669948059058
A severe course of alcohol withdrawal has been observed in 28% of patients in a neurological intensive care unit due to complicating central nerve system (CNS) diseases.	1.295387669636172
In any atypical alcoholic delirium, especially with focal neurological signs, partial seizures, or decreased level of consciousness, CNS diseases like meningoencephalitis, intracranial hemorrhage, or central pontine myelinolysis must be diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) scan and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) tap.	1.0530471264498447
The diagnostic and prognostic value of CT scan and CSF analysis was examined in 32 persons with alcohol withdrawal syndrome or delirium tremens.	1.081264159568913
Neurological complications and cerebral convulsions at the beginning of delirium tremens appear to predispose the patient to a protracted clinical course and necessary mechanical ventilation.	1.0411278858340365
Blood-CSF barrier permeability is increased in 70% of alcohol withdrawal patients and that also seems to be a marker of a prolonged clinical course.	1.1701090348005672
Cerebral atrophy as shown in CT scan does not play a role in predicting clinical course.	0.9409793285074802
In our experience, CT examination or lumbar puncture is not necessarily recommended if clinical signs are typical for alcohol delirium.	0.9950605274166076
Recently, an implantable hearing aid for rehabilitation of sensorineural hearing loss has been developed.	0.979489468533786
One component of the device is the microphone for implantation into the posterior canal wall.	0.9506175657577454
The membrane of the microphone can be covered by skin, cartilage, or fascia, avoiding reduction in sound transmission at the same time.	1.0101513832627114
In the study presented here, the microphone was implanted into 50 cadaver specimens of human temporal bone.	1.1549087056928793
Localization of the microphone was determined by the anatomical situation of the facial nerve.	1.105895190899237
The microphone and the piezoelectric transducer could be implanted in 78% of the temporal bones after total mastoidectomy.	1.280523167495922
In the final version of the microphone, the size was 4.5 mm and total weight 400 mg.	1.2876229135891535
Collagen vascular diseases, representing systemic soft tissue disorders, may cause a broad spectrum of pathologic changes of the respiratory tract.	1.0795776733430926
The type and extent of manifestations can vary considerably among individuals and entities.	0.7879871881876233
This survey describes the chest radiographic and, in particular, high-resolution computed tomographic (HRCT) findings of individual lesions of the respiratory tract.	1.1181576470892605
It includes fibrosing alveolitis (alveolitis, interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis) and bronchial (bronchitis/bronchiolitis, bronchiectasis), pleural and vascular manifestations, as well as lymphadenopathy and abnormalities related to therapy.	1.0460114394778404
We present typical patterns of changes in progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS, scleroderma), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD, Sharp syndrome), Sjögren syndrome, overlap syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).	1.019118427441156
Furthermore, we describe findings which are specific for individual entities such as esophageal involvement in PSS, acute pneumonitis and pulmonary hemorrhage in SLE, lymphoproliferative disease in Sjögren syndrome and necrobiotic nodules in RA.	1.042346566680618
The psychodynamics of patients with severe personality disorders, eating disorders, or "hysterical" symptoms are increasingly understood as ways of coping with traumatic experiences in childhood or adolescence such as abuse or violence.	1.01762732657673
Dissociation with induced depersonalisation, derealisation, and personification of objects as only good or only bad is the central coping mechanism during and after a traumatic experience.	1.0035543578646742
Unassimilated memories of traumata have a retraumatizing effect and call for defence through eating disorders, substance abuse, self-harming behaviour, or social acting-out.	0.8364828572514653
Against this psychodynamic background we describe a method of trauma-therapy which uses experiences of hypnotherapy and of Guided affective Imagery.	0.9697392822233966
In the preparatory phase a secure inner space and contact to inner helpers are established in the imagination using a resource-oriented approach.	0.8488678221471495
The actual trauma-therapy consists of a gradual leading-up to the traumatic scenes through consistent, minimally retraumatizing confrontation, followed by consolation and the ability to let go.	1.0463771672687123
In the final phase there is a return to resource-oriented creativity and concrete life planning.	0.9478387115339734
All patients of the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the Erfurt Hospital with odontogenic pyogenic infections have been analyzed in a retrospective study over a period of 10 years, from 1987 to 1997.	1.0554919289895262
This included questions concerning frequency, seriousness and treatment of these infections, social changes in the environ prove effects about the referral behaviour and the course.	1.0863801406523168
Odontogenic pyogenic infections are mixed infections.	0.6426757054016535
Aerobic agents such as hemolytic streptococcuses and staphylococcuses as well as anaerobic bacteria and  fungi can be involved.	0.799673806935122
Cephalosporine, aminobenzylpenicillin in combination with -lactamase inhibitor, alcylaminopenicillin and lincosamide are recommended based on analysis of infection resistance as first choice medications with carbapeneme as a reserve antibiotic.	0.8944251947774647
Hospitals are competing with each other for the limited financial resources available in the health care sector.	0.8410493207303068
Comparison of hospitals is legally required (BPflV § 5) to improve financial efficiency in the health care sector and make competition between hospitals keener, while also objectivizing it.	1.0647888589533239
If comparison of the hospitals is really to enhance profitability or efficiency, and not just to reduce the prices for hospital stays regardless of quality, it must extend to far more than the global figures in the compilation summarizing performance and calculation and the hospital statistics (no.	1.1674913299697485
of cases, days of care, length of stay, case lump sums and special fees).	0.8785163947274465
Documentation of particular features of the patient population, the potentials of the hospital and description of the treatment processes yield valuable information on capacity and performance level.	1.2797526504035766
With rising costs, the danger is growing that the quality and risk dimension of the actual medical treatment will not be promoted with the same enthusiasm by those offering the service.	1.1235413312108062
Hospital audit does not only allow a check on the hospital's own situation with regard to performance, quality, efficiency and patient satisfaction, but can also provide a basis for structural planning.	1.0454262619759975
The fact is that all efforts made and steps taken by the responsible persons in the hospital to improve the quality of structures, processes and results can only be successful if they are also perceived by the patients, the doctors who refer them and the visitors.	1.0846522090248396
If hospital audit is restricted to the bed occupancy and the invoicing data, it is only realistic to expect cuts in performance level.	0.9791306577799398
This would be bad for the patient and, in view of the consequent costs, also for the overall costs in the health care sector.	1.1494741701594333
Against the backdrop of a future performance-related system of remuneration instead of the principle of covering one's own costs that has been in place hitherto, openness about treatment results gains in importance as a competition parameter for qualified hospitals.	0.9836560252430389
Laparoscopic pelvic lymph node dissection was performed in 120 patients scheduled to undergo either radical perineal prostatectomy or radiation therapy.	0.9312800200575544
On average 13 lymph nodes were resected in each patient, and 21 patients were found to have metastatic disease in 1-9 lymph nodes.	1.1418004701348037
After an initial learning curve, mean operative time was reduced significantly, allowing laparoscopic lymph node dissection and radical prostatectomy to be performed as a one-stage procedure.	1.2435665155256377
The overall complication rate was 10 %; open revisions were necessary in only 2 of 120 patients.	1.0703562253950247
Postoperative hospital stay was 2 days in patients undergoing laparoscopic lymph node dissection only.	1.0713256525776738
This minimally invasive procedure is particularly beneficial to patients with lymph node metastases not undergoing radical prostatectomy, as well as to patients planned to be treated by radiation therapy.	1.1025968937199102
The combination of laparoscopic lymph node dissection and radical perineal prostatectomy avoids an abdominal incision and thus shortens both the hospital stay and the period of convalescence.	1.0247654843144876
Taking the concepts of psychic structure and internal representation as an example, three different ways of relating psychoanalytic concepts to neurobiology are presented and discussed: the localizing, the metaphorical and the modelling relation.	1.201263056995137
The need is stressed not to mix up the different levels of description and explanation too early; at the same time it is argued that - after the dismissal of the old metapsychology - this way of relating offers a new chance to integrate neurobiological aspects in the concept of psychic structure without falling into the traps of biologistic reductionism and individualism.	1.0392902947410514
Following augmentation of the upper extremity muscles necessitated by damage to the brachial plexus, special post-operative care programs are required to provide the patient with the best possible results.	1.222774485519116
Proper care requires cooperation between the orthopedic surgeon, physical therapists and nurses.	0.8748012726944325
Only then can postoperative rehabilitation and functional control of the extremity improve.	0.9081349166294176
We describe interdisciplinary postoperative care programs for augmentation of the deltoid muscle with trapezius transfer, arthrodesis of the glenohumeral joint, biceps augmentation with the latissimus dorsi transfer, Steindler flexorplasty and augmentation of flexors/extensors muscles in the hand.	0.8517983489387014
The prevalence of type I allergy against latex was investigated in dental students by questionnaire, prick tests and the determination of specific IgE antibodies.	0.9148810762365427
Positive prick tests against different latex fluids were found in 18 (8.7%) of 206 students, with clinical relevance in 11 cases.	1.2464260383837116
When the total number of students in each semester was taken into account an increase in the minimal prevalence of clinically relevant latex allergy from 2% in the second semester to 10.4% in the tenth semester was seen.	1.3044528859713882
A history of glove intolerance presenting as a wheal-and-flare reaction was associated with a type I allergy against latex in only 50% of the affected subjects.	1.0749217724393252
Atopic diseases and hand eczema of different causes proved to be risk factors in 16 and 5 of 18 students with latex allergy, respectively.	0.9768384427894987
A high-ammonia accelerator-free latex fluid proved to be a very reliable test medium compared to the less sensitive determination of specific IgE antibodies to latex.	1.0637982951985354
Gastrointestinal obstruction is a frequently observed emergency with tumor patients.	0.8548781995266702
In addition to tumor relapse, the development of a second tumor or intraperitoneal tumor spreading, and benign alterations in advanced tumor stages (radiogenic stenosis, adhesions) may also be the cause for the obstruction.	1.2081188288531148
The main objective of therapy is an attempt to eliminate the intestinal obstruction through surgery.	1.0592175053834414
If this is not possible because of advanced intra-abdominal tumor expansion, several endoscopic or interventional radiology methods, and drugs are available, that are used on an individual basis and based on prevailing experience to relieve the patient's condition.	1.2027131248357934
The case of a 60-year-old female patient with a supraglottic larynx carcinoma (T3N2CM0) and bilateral enlargement of the laryngeal sacculus is presented.	1.1807122911873345
On one side, the sacculus opened atypically into the left vestibular fold.	0.822321693038477
The sacculus is a physiologic part of the roof of Morgagni's ventricle, the size of which can vary greatly.	1.003577737664347
These canal-like structures can be the point of origin of cysts, laryngoceles, mucoceles, and pyoceles.	0.9310042449998815
Adverse effects of resuscitation due to closed-chest cardiac massage are common, and the incidence is increased when an incorrect technique is used.	1.2203841610268953
Nevertheless, thrombolytic therapy of a myocardial infarction can become necessary even after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).	1.040156169825686
In these patients, the risk of thrombolytic therapy-induced bleeding is immanent.	0.9294910614992496
Implantable cardioverter/defibrillators (ICD) have led to a reduction in cardiac mortality in patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias.	1.0257736220288614
A considerable number of patients experience repeated shocks which may have an impact on the quality of life.	0.886538458662314
An overview of the 30 years history and developement of documentation and information systems in the Orthopedic University Hospital Heidelberg is presented.	1.0075221251593984
Since the foundation in 1967 four developmental phases can be described: first initiatives of medical doctors, establishment of a basic documentation system for scientific purposes, strategic information system planning and realisation of information systems with the possibility of controlling in medical areas and thereby steering of the services.	1.0106487375873177
Planning and realisation were accomplished within the framework of the masterplans and concepts of the university clinics of the state of Baden-Württemberg.	1.0112971792474554
The treatment success of nCPAP therapy (nasal continuous positive airway pressure) depends partly on the relief of symptoms and partly on long-term patient acceptance and the related avoidance of complications.Nasal complaints constitute the most frequently reported side effects and, together with problems of mask application, are among the primary factors causing an nCPAP-therapy to be prematurely discontinued.	1.087947041736517
The foramen ovale is anatomically open in 25 % of individuals, but functionally closed by the higher pressure in the left antrum.	1.2366290187899178
Right-to-left shunt and subsequent paradoxical embolism may occur when pressure in the left antrum rises, for example, as a result of pulmonary embolism.	1.1359740012007709
In the present case we demonstrate a patient who presented 20 days after osteosynthetic treatment of a femoral fracture with word-finding deficits.	1.1879046576321324
Cerebral MRT revealed a fresh ischemic insult.	0.6479320108964793
Duplex ultrasound of the legs showed a fresh thrombosis of the superficial femoral vein and scintigraphy of the lungs detected pulmonary embolism.	1.075400116878906
Transesophageal contrast echocardiography trapped a hemodynamically spontaneous, open foramen ovale.	0.832503030127494
Duplex ultrasound of the carotid arteries detected no pathological findings.	0.9049518239647765
Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism can be clinically unconspicuous and become manifest by cerebral deficits resulting from paradox embolism and cerebral ischemia.	0.8108713225852364
The diagnostic strategies in multiple trauma aim at rapid identification of life-threatening injuries, recognition of serious organ lesions, and evaluation of the systemic trauma impact, as well as the resulting host reaction.	1.0610549809320067
Besides improvements in the structure and organization, major innovations in imaging techniques have significantly improved and accelerated evaluation of the patient with multiple injuries in the emergency room.	1.2981237829234455
Systematic diagnostic work-up, integrated multidisciplinary approach, and defined algorithms for traumatic key symptoms represent the hallmarks of successful emergency room management.	0.9763799932873026
In particular, diagnostic work-up of injured body cavities using sonography and helical computed tomography are evaluated.	1.201324231147859
Pheochromocytomas are functionally active, catecholamine-secreting tumours of chromaffin tissue.	0.7469940322439333
The mainstay of pharmacological therapy is preoperative treatment with oral phenoxybenzamine.	0.917771001901673
This drug irreversibly alkylates alpha-1-adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle and renders them nonfunctional, thereby causing vasodilatation.	0.9320155817832196
The duration of action of a single dose is approximately 24 h. Therefore, postoperative hypotension is a hazard of therapy with phenoxybenzamine if adequate plasma volume repletion is not provided.	1.178737311917277
Prazosin, a short-acting, competitive alpha-1 blocker, has been used preoperatively, but has been criticized for its failure to adequately prevent perioperative hypertensive episodes.	1.2403626689598513
Case report: Case presentation of a 59-year old female patient, who has been treated for her cancer by a physician of internal medicine with peroxodisulphuric acid.	1.0362069957644098
For this therapy to be successful - according to the physician - all drugs especially the analgetics had to be stopped.	1.2638067985287456
We present a case of primary plasmocytoma of the left upper bronchus.	1.1454240966004359
Occlusion led to atelectasis of the left upper lobe and subsequent poststenotic pneumonia.	0.9039297394251021
Therapy consisted of local excision of the bronchus and postoperative radiotherapy.	0.9932494736424223
This type of lung-conserving therapy in a case of primary plasmocytoma has not been described before.	1.0901228745644276
545 male patients with a tentative diagnosis "urethritis" were examined between November 1984 and December 1994 in the Department of Dermatology and Venerology of the Military Hospital in Ulm.	1.124142224500268
The patients, aged from 18 to 58 years (mean age 24.1 years), were examined according to a standardized diagnostic procedure: ...	1.3317390040355763
The use of the Kaufman-Assessment Battery for Children (K-ABC) was evaluated with a sample of 50 mentally disabled adults in a wide age range, as there exist no special tests for this group of patients.	1.158013860757364
Intercorrelation- and factor analyses, and correlations with the German adaptation of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (HAWIE-R) proved the use of the K-ABC to be valid.	1.1158484136674058
As an assessment battery for children designed for the wide age range from 2-6 to 12-5 years is more adequate to the capability of intellectually impaired adults, the K-ABC delivers results on individual strengths and weaknesses, based on a neuropsychological theory.	1.0517662805673493
Thus the individual cognitive abilities can be assessed with more differentiation, and that gives an important base for intervention, partial remediation, and placement.	1.1855383007913554
Subject: Using multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) large body areas can scanned with high spatial resolution.	0.9020701736565443

Screening led to 317 biopsies with a positive predictive value of 0.33.	0.9099268039973362
All biopsy documentation available to the mammography physicians was analysed with a view towards biopsy interval and completeness of information fed back to the Mx physicians.	0.9263723467168641
Biopsy recommendations were acted upon in 29 % of cases within 2 weeks.	1.0683899512196047
With the exception of the dignity Mx physicians were incompletely informed about biopsy results.	0.7617431082746435
The surgical procedure was known in the doctors' offices in 62 % of the cases.	1.060301775489672
Specimen radiographies were not done regularly.	0.6199016203673199
A pathology report was available overall in 42 of 106 malignant cases, respectively.	0.753465354094469
With the exception of the histological diagnosis itself, no variable mentioned in the reports was documented completely.	1.1049393164435326
Only one third of the physicians received such reports routinely.	0.9773343127447673
Fail-safe information are requested by Mx physicians and can help them to better target biopsy recommendations.	0.8351759935436501
A (regional) quality assurance center should be made responsible to analyse the flow of information in mammography screening, to fill in gaps and to speed up professional cooperation.	1.0478612263536031
The high rate of recurrence after the treatment of adhesive obstruction demands special prophylactic treatment.	1.050482952840193
In a 13-year period, 52 out of 95 patients with major adhesions were provided with a long nasointestinal tube for intestinal splinting intraoperatively.	0.9987735641090884
The was being left in situ on an average of 6.6 days.	1.0370684444569513
After an observation period of at least 36 months a recurrence was seen in 2 of these 52 patients (3.9 %; causes: volvulus after 6 months/fibrinous peritonitis on the 6th postoperative day).	1.1218626184085023
Amongst the 43 'non-splinted' patients, recurrence of adhesive obstruction was documented in 8 cases (18.6 %; causes: adhesions after 0.3-136.9 months).	1.0331171447508796
In the course of aftercare abdominal complaints were significantly fewer in patients who had been splinted.	0.9428249130366841
Complications concerning the nasointestinal tubes did not occur.	0.5527384207869699
The rate of perioperative complications was similar in both groups.	0.8204819408673845
Minimally invasive cardiac surgery has been developed to offer patients the benefits of open heart operations with decreased pain and limited skin incision.	1.1151625603978668
In this study, we report the results of minimally AVR compared to the conventional method performed in the same period.	1.3470493695809216
From May 1996 to January 1998, 86 patients received isolated aortic valve replacement by the limited superior median sternotomy (group 1).	0.9564481144738747
As a control group (group 2), 78 patients were enrolled who underwent isolated aortic valve replacements by standard sternotomy in the same period.	1.0006537321755606
AV-synchrony and rate-responsive pacing are known as major factors to increase the maximum working capacity in patients with chronotropic incompetence.	0.8954647101585829
However, their importance throughout low-levels of exercise is poorly evaluated.	1.2032062412062172
We studied 11 patients with implanted dual-chamber pacemakers (Telectronics, META 1254) concerning oxygen uptake kinetics during serial treadmill exercise testing at a constant workload of 35 W (LITE protocol).	0.9265483087004581
Each patient was tested in VVIR-, DDD-, and DDDR-mode.	1.216214917689337
All AV delays were constant at 160ms.	0.602248099517884
The oxygen deficit (O2D), mean response time (MRT) for oxygen uptake, and a oxygen deficit index (O2Di) were determined.	1.3393226937182976
In addition, the heart rate (HR) and bloodpressure were monitored.	0.8694340216937323
Results: Significant differences (p<0.01) were observed in HR and O2D when comparing both DDD- to VVIR- and DDD- to DDDR-modes.	1.22781320640459
Comparing the randomly synchronous VVIR- to the DDDR-mode, only the MRT of oxygen uptake demonstrated a significant decrease in the DDDR-mode (p<0.05).	0.9369885151540718
There were also significant decreases in O2Di and MRT in the DDDR-mode, as compared to the non-rate responsive DDD-mode (p<0.01).	0.8005075414696425
Stress testing in PM patients with an appropriate chronotropic response to low intensity exercise demontrates that AV synchrony is of much less influence on oxygen uptake kinetics than the rate-adaptive pacing.	0.9907447926071102
Purpose: This paper discusses the role of different imaging modalities in the diagnostic work-up of Crohn's disease (CD).	1.195564717994604
Introduction: Results of animal experiments have demonstrated that the osseous integration of non-cemented prostheses can, at the very least temporarily, be impaired by the application of non-steroidal antiphlogistic agents (such as diclofenac).	1.11451456355614
It is the objective of this study to examine whether there is a direct influence of diclofenac used in usual clinical dosages (3 times 50 mg daily) on bone cells and their progenitor cells which would explain the observed slow integration of the prostheses.	1.2909701256822033
Methods: To investigate this, cultivated human in vitro osteoblasts and stromal bone marrow cells were incubated with increasing doses of the medications.	1.1760858197752475
Our study focused on the effect of diclofenac application on proliferation and functional metabolism in both cell lines.	0.7278144440433822
The measurable maximal plasma concentration 2h after the application of one tablet Voltaren 50 reached 1.6µg/ml.	0.7649391908538451
This correlated with diclofenac concentrations between 1 and 10 ml found in our experiments.	0.935404512883283
The detected values were correlated to the control group (0 µg/ml diclofenac).	0.9565353989106091
Results: The drug effect upon osteoblasts was higher than on progenitor cells.	0.9842062116138351
The proliferation of in vitro stromal bone marrow cells, compared to untreated cells, was found to be decreased.	1.0955821090604372
We observed a decrease to 82% at a diclofenac concentration of 1 µg/ml, Osteoblasts exhibited a decrease to 97,5% at the same concentration.	1.2904225755477317
The DNA synthesis increased to 118% in stromal bone marrow cells, in osteoblasts to 144%.	0.962649535189875
In contrast, we detected a neglectible decrease to 92% in the collagen synthesis of osteoblasts compared to untreated cells.	1.2704809159943409
The synthesis of osteocalcin by osteoblasts increased to 119%.	0.7064857166972232
The alkaline phosphatase activity was found to be decreased to 88% in stromal bone marrow cells and increased in osteoblasts to 111%.	1.0266870278066031
Conclusion: Temporary inhibiting effects on osseous integration in non-cemented prosthesis by diclofenac could be caused by a disturbance in the anabolic bone metabolism, exhibited by an increase of osteoblastic osteocalcin expression.	1.0692066424662778
Osteocalcin as a known negative regulator of the osteoneogenesis is most likely inhibiting the collagen matrix deposition.	0.8740957805049229
Recent investigations have controversially but convincingly interpreted the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (arteriosclerosis).	0.9375102566407366
Atherosclerosis can apparently be the result of ultrachronic, persistent infection by Chlamydia pneumoniae and not the result of heterogenous risk factors.	0.9787013876438716
The main arguments for chlamydial genesis are: Correlation of coronary heart disease and other atherosclerotic diseases and antibodies against Chlamydia pneumoniae.	0.8490106808784178
(2) Chlamydia pneumoniae could be detected with different techniques (PCR, ICC, immunhistology, electromicroscopy, culture) in a high percentage of atheromas from different sites.	1.1681264209529132
(3) According to three successful international studies with macrolides in coronary heart disease.	0.8072610105348459

(7) Elevated levels of acute-phase proteins and other inflammatory signs (CRP, WBC count, fibrinogin) briefly before cardiac infarction occurs.	0.9397284912438499
There are good arguments for intervention studies in coronary heart disease and other manifestations of atherosclerosis.	0.9213763428522582
The relevant antibiotics are available for chlamydial infections and are inexpensive and safe.	0.8779210385260354
Meticulous protocols and long-term monitoring of patients should be developed.	0.8855268304187085
The pre- and postoperative symptoms of zygomatic bone fractures were examined in a follow-up study to prepare a classification proposal.	1.193533379815136
A differential indication for minimally invasive therapy modes was looked for with respect to this proposal.	0.8168192367448847
Therapy of isolated zygomatic bone fractures consisted in repositioning with a hook and miniplate fixation across the frontozygomatic suture.	0.7671326170731841
The aims of this study were clinical and radiological assessment of the repositioning result in terms of aesthetics and stability and quantification of the postoperative remission of disturbances of sensitivity of the infraorbital nerve.	1.0809292255645855
A total of 52 patients were examined.	1.0045678826949458
After the operation (on average after 3.5 days following the trauma) they were followed-up postoperatively for 12 months according to a strict schedule.	1.2386230948122825
Preoperatively, 49 patients reported disturbances of sensitivity of the infraorbital nerve.	0.7001536628333348
Other symptoms, such as periorbital haematoma and flattening of the zygomatic prominence, were observed in 49 patients and 45 patients, respectively.	1.052759903740667
All fractures were repositioned well as assessed clinically and radiologically.	0.8481445360245181
The aesthetic result was evaluated as symmetric and durable in all cases.	0.8505332495550182
Six months postoperatively 41 patients reported normal sensitivity in the area of the infraorbital nerve.	0.763893405920179
In only five patients (10.2%) was the sensitivity loss persistent throughout the entire follow-up period.	1.264012885644002
Patients with primarily lacking diplopia developed neither eye motility disturbances nor postoperative enophthalmus in the following period.	0.8675904888281836
It can be concluded that the treatment of an isolated zygomatic bone fracture which satisfies aesthetic and functional requirements is possible by reposition and fixation with one miniplate at the lateral orbital rim.	1.0688333148368403
An additional osteosynthesis at the infraorbital rim or at the zygomaticomaxillary crista is not necessary.	0.8063527167558981
A routine revision of the orbital floor is only indicated in cases of preoperative diplopia.	0.897656030187589
A zygomatic bone fracture connected with diplopia should be classified as combined zygomatic-/orbital floor fracture.	0.9094636380578137
Chronic primary headache has a considerable impact on the quality of life.	0.7134763668156061
To date, this impact has been evaluated by measurements of the general pain specific impairment of the quality of life.	1.0268953746445264
Headache specific measurements of quality of life or of disability caused by the headache are still missing for the German language.	1.1673245697818462
In America, a headache specific questionnaire, the "Headache Disability Inventory" (HDI), has been evaluated which is used in the presented study to create a German version, the "Inventar zur Beeinträchtigung durch Kopfschmerzen" (IBK).	1.269556710245845
94 consecutive patients with a primary headache disorder (59 female, 35 male; mean age 40 +/- 12 years) were examined.	1.2228942863348222
Cronbach's alpha was a=0.90, the test-retest-reliability after three months was r=0.87.	0.8665585385113258
An analysis of subscales for emotional and functional disability showed similar values for the internal consistency and the test-retest-reliability of these subscales.	0.8666500376667704
The scores of the different headache types did not differ significantly.	1.1218840387033444
In post-hoc-analyses, however, cluster headache showed higher disability scores than migraine both in the total scale and in the subscales.	1.0718996711664575
The total score of the IBK was significantly correlated with the number of headache days per month (r=0.41; p<0.0003) but not with the duration of disease or other demographic parameters.	1.075546307125658
The IBK is the first German headache specific measurement of certain aspects of the quality of life in chronic headache patients.	1.133897716289522
It can be used in clinical settings to evaluate the current state of the patient or to monitor treatment and it can be used for scientific studies.	1.4698819354693586
Age and menstrual cycle have an important influence on the breast.	0.7854430742836921
This well-known fact is experienced in the daily routine of gynecologists and radiologists.	0.9419897981153165
The number of publications addressing the effect of these influences on imaging, however, is surprisingly low.	1.0759618646367772
The aim of this work is to describe the influences of age and menstrual cycle on the breast and to address their clinical relevance for mammography and MR mammography.	1.1680799067623662
Therefore, own data are presented concerning the age and menstrual cycle influences on breast parenchyma in dynamic MR mammography.	1.1299037196190829
Literature data are used to correlate mammography and MR imaging findings with these influences.	1.0044816563211056
The changes of the breast due to age and menstrual cycle have important direct implications on performing and reading conventional mammography and MR mammography.	0.9109083968682528
The knowledge of these changes is also helpful in the interpretation of findings when comparing different methods.	0.9171534873952145
Finally, the data gained by using imaging methods enable important basic insights into physiology and physiopathology of the breast in vivo.	1.1305935508074654
As part of our neonatal screening program we applied tandem mass spectrometry on 128.225 dried blood samples for detection of inborn errors of metabolism.	0.8255459290947968
Appendectomy is one of the most frequent surgical procedures.	0.9090324319476875
Accuracy in the clinical diagnosis of acute non-specific appendicitis, however, suffers from the fact that the symptoms and clinical findings of acute appendicitis can be mimicked by many other abdominal diseases.	1.2837872334069467
The clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis, therefore, can only be definitely confirmed by pathomorphological analysis, the criteria of which are reviewed in this paper.	1.187305301562493
Special emphasis is given to distinct variants of acute appendicitis and the significance of neuroappendicopathy.	0.9547550435768728
Extra-articular interventions by osteotomies to correct the axial malpositioning of the joint (genu varum or valgum) are treatments proven over many years.	1.0043045349542086
The middle and long term results shows many patients are very satisfied.	1.0750274275159835
Unfortunately a uniform critical examination is lacking because the investigators used no scores.	0.8063844414429956
The good results by infra- and supracondylar osteotomies - some of them for 15 years and more - have to be achieved by prosthesis first.	1.2295798140743424
The important facts for gonarthrosis of the knee joint are the axial malpositioning, the miss load, and the instability of the joint; these facts are the cause for the complaints and for the restriction of functional efficiency.	1.2202531396878271
Therefore, indication of infra- or supracondylar osteotomies is not limited by the age of the patient.	1.2045393815178096
The most important fact is the condition of the joint, especially the quality of bone, the instability of the joint, and the loss of bone.	1.2730674408515459
Given the right indication, the treatment of genu varum and valgum by osteotomies is an important factor in preserving the joint.	0.9534409314790825
Also, there are still chances to do another operation, such a prothesis.	1.3335482735766566
A prothesis can be implanted if the osteotomy has no chance to preserve the joint.	0.8901807131005778
Psychic trauma may be followed by a variety of unpredictable reactions by the subject, which differ individually and are dependant upon the situation.	0.9657836851162137
Differentiation between psychic crises and psychiatric emergency situations (PES) is often difficult as the first might proceed into the second and definitions of the two tend to blur.	1.180056449010498
This article aims to overview the different psychic and psychiatric disturbances which are relevant in preclinical emergency medicine.	0.8670231492947229
A definition is offered to outline PES that require immediate medical intervention and crises due to psycho-social reasons.	0.7665690041287968
For the most important disturbances and syndromes the differential diagnostic procedures and therapeutic strategies are presented.	1.1782992446021023
Acute pancreatitis is a multietiologic entity with rather diverse clinical courses.	0.7520271942086362
Whereas edematous pancreatitis has a mortality of less than 1%, nowadays; still approximately 20% of all patients with the necrotizing form succumb to the disease.	1.2622262609650796
To further improve therapeutic results a standardized approach should be used.	0.8880823726737251
For effective treatment the differentiation between edematous and necrotizing pancreatitis is crucial.	0.8841794219372401
All patients with signs of pancreatic necroses during abdominal ultrasound and patients with organ insufficiencies should undergo a CT-scan to define exactly the nature and the extent of the disease.	1.02491427674333
Primarily all patients are treated conservatively.	1.0431714656853166
Main indications for operative intervention are signs for infection of pancreatic necroses and an acute abdomen due to local complications of acute pancreatitis.	1.1570620282557076
In cases of biliary origin an elective cholecystectomy has to be performed during a free interval to prevent a recurrence.	1.0979071888504657
Objective: Diagnosis of osteomyelitis is difficult in early state of disease.	1.1491797784305633
Usually, characteristic X-ray findings cannot be obtained during the first week of disease.	1.3142489219722646
Sonography, scintigraphy and magnetic resonance tomography were compared at clinical manifestation of osteomyelitis.	0.969240896416235
A 73-year old female patient is known to have hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) since 1989.	1.139895261729026
After a transmural anterolateral myocardial infarction with the development of a large apical aneurysma of the anterior wall, a previously measured gradient of 11 mm Hg in the LVOT is no longer detected.	1.1281965530320976
As a consequence of this casuistry, "pseudo-myectomy" caused by myocardial as an example of an uncommon spontaneous course of HOCM.	1.1451886790961536
Aim: Intensified insulin therapy is the therapy of choice for patients with diabetes Type I.	1.1362325055379527
Intensified insulin therapy includes an basis-bolus insulin injection regimen or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, several times daily blood glucose self-monitoring, self-adaptation of insulin dosages by the patients themselves and a far-reaching liberalization of nutrition.	0.9566239058688554
The patients learn selfmanagement of diabetes therapy in a structured treatment and teaching program.	0.8888949136590371
The effectivity of this program is evaluated in the routine care.	1.0452661109450412
The treatment of idiopathic scoliosis over 40  ° (Cobb) during the growth period is under discussion concerning the indication for conservative or surgical treatment.	1.038950386174778
Curve progression depends on the degree of the frontal and sagittal deformity, vertebral rotation, rigidity of the curve, the skeletal age, the age and sex of the patient, the familial frequency of scoliosis and the location of the curve.	1.1550144937929507
In scoliosis over 40  ° progression is fast and the possibilities for successful conservative brace treatment are reduced during the growth period.	0.9089190004534493
Progression occurs more frequently in thoracic and double major scolioses, especially in young patients (Risser sign 0 and 1).	1.160371537239689
The purpose of this study was to evaluate low-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with an open system and to correlate results obtained with the experience of the radiologist.	1.2051329662292183
Between August 1995 and May 1997, 75 patients at the Unfallchirurgische Universitätsklinik, Mainz, Germany, with an acute trauma of the knee joint were operated on arthroscopically after clinical examination, X-ray and MRI imaging.	1.1770266363928188
MRI analysis was performed by two independent radiologists with varying MRI experience without knowledge of the patient's history.	1.0942414704971706
The sensitivity and specifity of the more [U1] and the less experienced [U2] radiologist ranged from 83 to 100% (U1) and from 61 to 100% (U2).	1.1314040681081914
Positive and negative predictive value ranged from 83 to 100% (U1) and from 58 to 100% (U2); accuracy ranged from 92 to 100% (U1) and from 77 to 100% (U1).	1.0366427263907099
We conclude that the results of low-field MRI are comparable with those of high-field MRI and that differences in the results of the experienced and less experienced radiologist can be established.	1.3009345524751943
In intervention trials it was without exception possible to influence the development of atherosclerosis by a reduction of the LDL-cholesterol and an increase in HDL-cholesterol and to reduce complications like myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, angina or heart failure.	0.9921545629982725
Changes of lifestyle can be effective, but are rarely accepted and are difficult to communicate.	1.0234044749400082
Dermatosurgery has been gaining in importance in recent years.	0.736954205514083
In departments of dermatology German-speaking countries the total number of operations increased by 58% from 1984 to 1991.	1.029469298815637
The increase in the number of operations of moderate and extreme severity was especially marked.	0.8370813764038549
Out-patient dermatosurgery was also performed mainly by dermatologists as opposed to other specialties.	0.825329254272524
From 1988 to 1992 dermatologists in private practice recorded an increase of 40.6% in the number of operative procedures they performed.	1.0341819722037249
The importance of dermatosurgery in hospital and private practice can be expected to continue increasing in the future; dermatologists must therefore prepare themselves for the present and future challenges inherent in surgery of the skin.	1.0796195132122097
There is evidence that diastolic function is a major determinant of overall cardiac performance.	0.9472383238703636
Intraoperative use of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) enables Doppler measurement of mitral inflow pattern (E/A ratio).	0.9832611052256238
The E/A ratio is suggested to be a reliable index of changes in myocardial relaxation.	1.032078114647276
In the present study we compared the time course of the E/A ratio and the time constant of myocardial relaxation () assessed by direct left ventricular pressure recordings in patients before and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).	1.1890386818648988
After ethical approval, 12 patients undergoing CABG surgery were studied.	0.9653832395719222
Measurements of the E/A ratio and  were performed after induction of anesthesia (I), immediately prior to CPB with the pericardium open (II), 5 min after CPB (III), and after sternal closure (IV).	1.1511658445034747
Time constant of myocardial relaxation was calculated as the reciprocal value of the slope of the left ventricular dP/dt and left ventricular pressure plot.	1.0332353786507384
The E/A ratio was significantly decreased at the end of surgery (IV).	0.8061717695129826
In contrast,  was increased immediately after CPB, but decreased after sternal closure (IV).	1.0090361728735282
Cardiac index and heart rate both increased after CPB.	0.815429659889355
The results of the present study demonstrate that diastolic dysfunction occurred immediately after CPB, as indicated by an increase in the time constant of myocardial relaxation.	1.1639326061746655
However,  improved rapidly to pre-CPB values.	1.4714609644623777
The E/A ratio alone failed to detect the initial post-CPB alteration in left ventricular relaxation.	0.8867114578929461
Acute exercise is followed by a mobilization of white blood cells, mainly induced by increased levels of catecholamines and cortisol.	0.9750927826871668
NK-cells react the most intensive, they can increase fivefold after intensive exercise.	1.0025287547166293
Additionally a weak acute-phase reaction occurs.	0.7169251883066812
Most of these changes normalize during twenty-four hours.	1.0856343926951624
Parameters of the humoral immune system may be different from the pre-exercise levels up to seventy-two hours.	0.9665654918751077
Repeated physical exercise, which is typical for sports, is followed only by small changes of immunologic parameters under conditions of rest.	1.175370877323843
Epidemiological studies give clues that the rate of upper respiratory tract infections in athletes can be described by a j-shaped curve.	1.0063318657683438
Moderately active subjects have the lowest rate of infection.	0.8229943294692422
For this influence of exercise on health mainly functional changes seem to be important.	0.9188001922589801
Especially after exccentric exercise immunological cells can be seen in the muscle tissue, which remove destructed tissue.	0.9704873947056125
Not very much is known about the role of the immune system in the regeneration of tendons and other bradytrophic tissues.	0.986774029843324
To achieve septoplasty without compromising the surgical goal of attaining a straight and solid septum, even in cases of marked deviations or severe post-traumatic deformities, we now use a new technique in which the septal reconstruction includes the placement of a resorbable implant as a "compound graft".	1.1121383526398942
For this purpose the entire septal cartilage is removed, and the severely deviated part is divided into straight sections that are reconnected to each other to form a straight and solid plate.	1.0942846674081899
As connecting material we use a polydioxanon (PDS) foil.	0.6933592706692464
The sections of cartilage are sutured to the foil with PDS suture material.	0.754364981590778
The compound graft thus constructed consists of the septal cartilage and resorbable alloplastic material and is reimplanted into the nose.	0.8743557442339296
The PDS and suture material are usually resorbed within 8 months, excluding long-term complications.	0.9783863516042148
During the past 2 years this method was used in treating 38 patients.	1.12611123743063
The surgical goal was attained in every case, and no immediate or long-term complications occurred.	1.3129047099868933
This method of combining septal cartilage with a resorbable implant leads to a better, significant correction of even severe septal deviations.	1.0591231224852204
Two types of corticosteroid receptors have been identified in the brain and pituitary that play an important role in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis.	0.7475804451216238
These glucocorticoid hormone binding receptors are the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR).	0.9722802895349076
Evidently, a tight control of the concentration and function of these receptors is of prime importance for maintaining and regaining homeostasis after stressful challenges.	1.0617383690914093
Here, we describe a novel mechanism revealing a rapid upsurge in MR density in the hippocampus (a limbic structure highly involved in HPA axis regulation) after an acute psychologically stressful challenge.	1.1586377804034815
This rise in MR is accompanied by a stronger MR-mediated inhibitory control of the HPA axis.	0.8996914869067932
Thus, an acute stressful experience results in a reorganization of the HPA axis involving a principal role of the hippocampal MR.	1.1610320372945075
This novel mechanism may be of significance for increasing our understanding of the etiology of stress-related disorders.	1.0743000512636967
The wide variety of therapeutic effects make neuroleptics potent drugs in the treatment of pain.	1.0095002831077309
Until now there has been no proof of their analgesic potency; in spite of this fact, neuroleptics are used to treat chronic pain states on the assumption that they do have analgesic potency.	1.1107511371534053
A metaanalysis was performed and 48 publications reviewed.	0.9348166452169198
Thirty-four, the majority of the studies, are case reports, retrospective analyses or non-randomised cohort studies.	1.2284615021781755
Most of these reports attest to a positive effect.	1.0622148726177445
However, only ten out of fifteen studies with a higher statistical study power describe a possible analgesic effect.	1.198970366997609
None of the studies could differentiate between the effects of analgesia and sedation of the drugs used.	1.1133495803733837
The metaanalysis provides no evidence of intrinsic analgesic properties of neuroleptics for their use as adjuvant analgesics.	0.871994118156247
Studies into the pathophysiology of acute ischaemic stroke have indicated that treatment options are likely to be optimised when early signs of stroke are recognised and treatment is initiated within 3 hours from symptom onset.	0.9449639831298876
For most patients there is a long delay between the onset of symptoms and the start of therapy.	1.0881125494510062
Many factors are responsible for this time delay: signs and symptoms often go unrecognised by patients, relatives and bystanders and stroke is not given a high priority by medical staff.	0.9852122824806707
Although a small number of stroke patients is treated as emergency and attended to by the emergency medical services within this time window, this number could easily be increased by intensified public and emergency personnel education.	1.0478210437687379
For the future, we hope that emergency medical services (EMS) will be able to initiate therapies which must be administered within the first few hours of acute stroke.	1.0047455791439655
Standard of care by the EMS personnel includes maintenance of oxygenation, treatment of cardiac arrhythmia and hypertension as well as hyperglycemia and hyperthermia.	1.0655404976059177
Early notification by the emergency medical services about stroke patients would enable stroke teams to be present at admission, thus improving the likelihood of a better outcome for patients.	0.9836752576390647
A decrease in compliance of the ascending aorta caused by prosthetic replacement or "wrapping" may lead to a partial loss of the arterial Windkessel-function.	1.0318393291470311
The following study investigated the effects of this intervention on aortic input impedance.	0.8542104225817898
In 8 pigs, the wall of the ascending aorta was wrapped with a prosthesis.	1.020089150432444
This approach was chosen to minimize additional influence of extended operative procedures on the ascending aorta, like extracorporal circulation, cardioplegia or blood loss.	0.9380917415818597
Flow and pressure were recorded before and after the intervention, and following Fourier Transformation, the aortic input impedance was calculated.	1.0748653676328923
Mean pressure, mean flow, and total peripheral resistance were unaltered, while there was a significant increase in blood pressure amplitude and characteristic impedance in response to the "wrapping" procedure.	1.1330493895781975
Thus, it becomes obvious that even the loss of elastic properties of the ascending aorta only leads to an increase of left ventricular load.	1.1545673432056704
Cervical lymphadenopathies are widespread diseases in otorhinolaryngology.	0.5622395301211842
There are many differential diagnoses which have to be considered when swelling persists.	1.0316729278301964
To gain further information it is advisable to perform sonographically controlled fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNP).	0.8380469217329141
If there is no reliable result, it is necessary to remove a lymph node.	1.0436061892064294
We report on the rare case of isolated histiocytosis X in lymph nodes.	1.096723501708375
A 63-year-old male had noticed a swelling of the right side of the neck about 6 weeks previously.	1.1228471393212371
The preliminary examinations (FNP/blood examinations) revealed no pathological findings.	0.8965292694689179
Only the histological examination delivered the diagnosis of histiocytosis X.	0.9644993765665774
Systemic manifestation was excluded by staging examinations.	0.6841744208760393
No further therapy was necessary after lymph node extirpation.	0.8241306900320078
The report demonstrates how to diagnose and treat this rare disease.	0.798124856401652
We report our preliminary results using a new magnetic resonance imaging technique for visualization of the urinary tract.	1.1055973028769959
Using the paramagnetic contrast medium gadolinium diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA), we were able to obtain images of the urinary tract comparable to those obtained by conventional excretory urography.	1.025378876793484
The major advantage of our technique is that besides good morphologic visualization, the excretion of gadolinium-DTPA can be studied simultaneously.	0.9546857436261308
We demonstrate our preliminary results in selected cases.	0.5798114031321996
Microcallus formations are demonstrable in nearly all cancellous bones by means of suitable preparation techniques.	0.7674678076287959
Histologically, these structures are immature fibrous bone formed in local overloaded parts of the trabeculae.	0.9420533098389231
Using a preparation technique that allows combined two- and threedimensional analysis, 26 normal human spines and 11 osteoporotic spines were investigated for microcallus.	0.9984783777729112
Microcallus formations occur frequently in people over 45 years of age.	0.6351752406100754
They are mainly localized in the lower thoracic and lumbar spine and occur significantly more frequent in females than in males.	1.0205109228312443
The number of microcallus formations depends more on the microarchitecture of the cancellous bone than on individual trabecular parameters.	0.8444443870277569
In about 33 % of cases microfractures are demonstrable in the centre of the microcallus formation.	1.1226001146530502
In noninvasive studies the bone mass could be misinterpreted due to microcallus.	0.7821558129241695
Although it indicates instability of the bone structure, microcallus formation is not a purely negative mechanism.	1.0681678931696281
It stabilizes and regenerates the bone tissue.	0.6061150920528309
Furthermore, complete new trabeculae can be formed due to bridges of microcallus between residual trabeculae.	1.0876047560696749
Osteoporosis is not the result of an inability to form microcallus.	1.0465135388230753
DNA cytometric investigations of intraosseous cystic lesions and osteoblastic tumors may be helpful in morphological diagnosis.	0.8577164054682536
The detection of a DNA-aneuploid stemline supports the diagnosis of a high-grade malignant bone neoplasm, even in small biopsies.	1.2625148548642842
Solitary and aneurysmal bone cysts have DNA-diploid cell populations.	0.759511259542531
Low-grade central osteosarcomas may show single-cell aneuploidies of varying extent as well as a DNA-diploid stemline.	1.109721699385027
Their presence may be a sign of genetic instability within the population of neoplastic cells before a DNA-aneuploid stemline is established and should prompt careful postoperative observation.	0.9480354877180182
Although noise in general can induce hearing loss, environmental noise represents an important risk for children, teenagers and young adults.	1.0310523349363556
Epidemiological investigations now support the occurrence of an increasing number of irreversible hearing losses in these groups.	0.8950273880082984
Major causes of hearing loss are toys (guns), explosives and electroacoustically amplified music delivered by head sets or heard in discotheques and open air concerts.	0.9302008318699095
The development of arthroscopic wrist surgery has helped to understand the anatomy and pathology of the wrist joint.	0.8804146942187859
One of the most important functions of the arthroscopic inspection in the radiocarpal and mediocarpal joints is the evaluation of the wrist stability.	1.1351086482281263
State of the art in the hand surgery today includes a combination of arthroscopic and arthroscopic assisted operations.	1.059924093735984
The arthroscopy of the wrist offers significant information independent from the standard radiological diagnostic tools.	1.0443368485916915
TFCC lesions and scapholunate dissociation remain to be the most common causes for arthroscopic wrist surgery.	1.1164292488979584
Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) is a consequence of vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency and in the majority of cases due to alcoholism.	1.1223121214143983
We report here the case of a 26-year-old male alcoholic who had stayed helplessly at home for 4 days until hospital admission.	1.086560281568528
Clinical diagnosis was difficult due to major disturbance of consciousness.	0.8352614856393843
MRI showed an increase in signal intensity (T2-, FLAIR-weighted) around the third ventricle, the quadrigeminal bodies, the fornices, the mamillary bodies, the floor of the fourth ventricle and around the aqueduct.	1.200829002350482
These findings were indicative of WE although of unusual extent.	0.7772479300436987
In this case MRI correlated well with clinical symptomatology.	0.9959812168730557
Therapy with thiamine was started immediately and symptoms as well as MRI findings resolved partially.	0.8655346117732297
The presented case illustrates the diagnostic usefulness of MRI in WE especially if the patient is of reduced consciousness and clinical investigation is limited.	1.1033869575063862
Background: SLO microperimetric examination after the extraction of choroidal neovascular membranes (CNV) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) shows absolute scotoma in the area of pigment epithelial loss.	1.0666966836864984

The functional results of these two methods should be compared before the surgical procedure is expanded.	1.269613433562823
Three case reports of a pseudomeniscus and an angiomatoid vascular proliferation of the synovial membrane as rare aseptic complications of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty are presented.	0.9413998233619792
Neither complication can be confirmed by clinical examination, laboratory findings or diagnostic imaging techniques.	0.8586782139232028
Arthroscopy of the knee joint permits both diagnostic evaluation and low-risk surgical treatment.	1.0404342721184332
Strabismus surgery in children is associated with a high incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).	0.9685130166040097
We report on a case of a 23 years old man who was polytraumatized in a car accident.	1.160308421547773
He survived with excellent clinical outcome, but after 113 days after the accident he collapsed, massive bleeding out of the mouths started and the patient died within a few minutes.	1.2359397659688678

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of oral leukoplakia (OL) in HIV-positive patients and to evaluate the clinical and histopathological features and the presence of Candida hyphae and viral infections (HSV 1, 2, HPV, EBV and CMV) by immunocytochemical methods using mono- or polyclonal antibodies.	1.201761647728744
A total of 269 HIV-seropositive patients, (222 men, median age 36.7 years and 47 women, median age 32 years) were registered.	1.1984063861348648
OL occurred in 20/269 (7.4%) patients (men, smokers, median age 38 years); the non-homogeneous form was observed in 11%.	1.0411418082750328
A lesional biopsy specimen was obtained from 8/20 patients.	0.8351733832383768
Specimens did not show signs of epithelial dysplasia.	0.8311269246195515
Candida hyphae were evident in 2/8 cases.	0.8230784857237736
Two patients tested positive for HPV and CMV; antibodies against EBV, HSV1 and 2 were negative.	0.7777450092227663
In conclusion, the prevalence of OL is comparatively high in this group of HIV-seropositive patients (7.4% vs. 0.9-2.2%).	1.1756791679322542
Moreover, the mean age of the study group at the time of diagnosis for oL was lower (38 years vs. 60 years).	1.3091904482569419
Damage/dysfunctioning of the heart forms part of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in sepsis and SIRS.	0.9988072248559376
This acute septic cardiomyopathy is often underestimated in degree and relevance, although about 10% of all sepsis fatalities are due to intractable heart failure.	1.0965780057048444
This potentially reversible cardiomyopathy is characterized by a considerable pump failure, not primarily ischemic, with coronary blood flow being normal or even enhanced; the left and right ventricle is enlarged as a consequence of an increased ventricular compliance.	1.1849289536295293
Damage of the heart can further be aggravated in case of additional right ventricular impairment due to pulmonary hypertension in ARDS.	0.9846709675546982
SIRS-cardiomyopathy in non-infectious MODS has common traits with acute septic cardiomyopathy.	0.8331704634729101
The pathogenesis of heart disease in sepsis and SIRS is multifactorial, the endotoxin/TNF/NO/ cGMP-cascade representing a main negative inotropic axis.	1.0288913994009883
Therapy of acute septic cardiomyopathy and SIRS-cardiomyopathy at present is still mainly symptomatic (volume substitution, inotropic/vasoactive agents); causal therapeutic principles are, however, put to test in the context of a comprehensive concept of causal sepsis treatment.	1.1071898702287684
Fractures of the distal metaphysis of the tibia often include an extension into the ankle.	1.0589574157080905
Intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw osteosynthesis should reduce the high incidence of soft tissue and ankle problems and should be an alternative to open plate fixation, with good ultimate functional outcome.	1.058425520048408
Between January 1993 and December 1995, a prospective study on 49 patients with distal metaphyseal tibia fracture and involvement of the ankle was performed.	1.0990418509535596
All the fractures were treated with intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw osteosynthesis, and plate fixation in cases of fibula fractures.	0.9174627842107069
There were 27 men and 22 women with an average age of 46.4  +/-  12.7 years (range 21-90).	1.1548544642610392
In most studies of the use of intramedullary nailing in distal tibial fractures the classification has been inadequate.	0.9103816565088356
Therefore a new classification according to Robinson et al.	0.8040084118506012
(1995) was used: 10 fractures were type II B (20.4 %), 13 were type II C (26.5 %), and 26 patients suffered a combination of type II B and type II C (53.1 %).	1.1711444111251141
This fracture type was defined as type II D for use in this study.	0.9048796311122799
The severity of soft tissue injury was recorded using the Gustilo system in case of open (n = 19) and the Tscherne system in case of closed fractures (n = 30).	1.1009610183001886
In 31 patients distal tibia fracture was accompanied by a fracture of the fibula, which was first stablized using a plate.	1.1087345604332752
For reconstruction of the distal articular surface, covered screw osteosynthesis was done.	1.001368018359596
At the next step intramedullary nails were inserted and were statically locked proximally and distally.	0.8357117897721529
From January 1993 to February 1994, the reamed AO standard nail was used.	0.8305185929862318
After introduction of the unreamed tibial nail (UTN) all fractures were treated by this implant.	1.000997079417886
Full load on the operated leg was allowed after 8 weeks.	0.83313074827223
Union of the fracture was assessed by standard radiological and clinical criteria.	1.1942686165803638
Misalignment was defined as more than 5  ° of angular rotation.	1.0984027538689436
Further surgery due to a valgus deformity in the ankle joint had to be done in three cases.	1.033604592646737
There were no deep infections.	1.025220066466489
Three patients had a superficial infection in the ankle area, but surgical debridement was not necessary.	1.2641234485357058
A leg shortening was found in 4 cases, but it was less than 1 cm in every case.	1.312432599995369
Therefore, surgical correction was not done.	1.4852463858548826
Patients were reviewed at intervals of 2, 6, and 12 weeks, and after 6, and at least 12 months.	1.4287555815823356
All 49 patients were finally reviewed after an average time of 15.7 months (range 12-38).	1.1641831061244203
Bone fusion was reached 12.8 weeks (range 9-21) after the operative treatment.	1.1562633988098832
A specific assessment of the ankle symptoms was made using the score of Olerud and Molander (1984).	1.0421429450621378
In 29 patients excellent results were recorded.	0.7352386834601363
A satisfactory result was attained with 17 patients and just 3 patients were found to be unsatisfactory.	0.9647227188833241
Although proximity of distal tibia fracture to the ankle makes the treatment more complicated than for fractures of the tibial diaphysis, closed intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw fixation is a good alternative to open reduction and plate fixation.	0.9138547692343324
The major advantages are closed procedure and simplified interlocking techniques.	0.7544404032470658
Therefore, closed intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw fixation is a safe and effective method of managing this type of fracture.	0.9345606126906202
Laryngeal candidiasis is very rare in the absence of other more proximal diseases in the aerodigestive tract.	0.969724147420986
The lesion shows pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia or acanthosis and, given its rarity, may be confused with cancer.	0.9710106034377907
In the present paper we report on a 56-year-old male patient who presented with hoarseness.	1.1234788620629903
Physical examination of the larynx revealed a hyperplastic lesion involving both vocal cords.	0.8290734462457845
The clinical aspect and the risk factor profile of the patient (ten bottles of beer and 40 cigarettes per day) generated the clinical diagnosis of laryngeal cancer.	1.1926144910693002
The histopathological examination of the specimen excluded a squamous cell carcinoma; however, it could not provide a clear diagnosis.	1.1101907375797364
Laryngeal papillomatosis and tuberculosis, which had been suspected, could be excluded.	1.03613505836497
As the lesion progressed, further biopsies led to the diagnosis of candidiasis.	1.0340946335199022
Systemic antimycotic treatment with fluconazol and amphotericin caused a complete remission.	0.7938328215689282
Lymphatic spread of bronchial carcinoma can reach any part of the mediastinum, irrespective of the localisation of the primary tumor.	0.8824482053502368
Metastatic spread may not affect al topographical lymph node positions, but this is unpredictable.	1.0146924339696968
The number of lymph nodes in each position varies.	0.8449977973462148
Therefore, systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection includes all ipsilateral compartments of the mediastinum.	1.026666262254641
It is also possible to reach contralateral sites.	1.0672262919457953
In right-sided thoracotomies the lymph node dissection is standardized.	0.9720496652233646
Mobilizing the aortic arch and the large vessels also allows complete mediastinal dissection by a left-sided approach.	0.8703121387357386
The surgical technique is described.	0.9031343116304592
Perioperative morbidity does not increase.	0.5654721441953844
Systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection is the gold standard for evaluation of an exact pN stage.	0.8810424605039158
The stage-related survival rate is significantly improved.	1.0654607178094213
Therefore, it should be required that systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection be standard in the surgical treatment of bronchial carcinoma.	1.1829161972307567
In the diagnosis and treatment of acute scrotal pain and swelling it is important to differentiate between testicular torsion and epididymo-orchitis.	1.0688237813731436
A special case of a thirty-eight-year-old male asylant from Nepal was presented in the urological service with acute scrotal pain.	1.1119766800693027
To exclude testicular torsion, a diagnostic exploration of the scrotum was done with the findings of an acute funiculitis with abscess formation.	1.1132413540441344
Under surgical drainage of abscess together with medical treatment the acute inflammation disappeared.	0.8000993325554125
The diagnosis of filarial funiculitis was made after identifying the microfilariae in a blood vessel and in the peripheral blood smear.	1.076739324229353

We studied 10 patients with Parkinson's disease and 12 patients with Parkinson-plus-syndrome, trying to improve patients' gait by application of various external rhythmic stimuli, including metronome stimulation (96 beats per minute=middle andante).	0.9973978025269424
The test course of the patients was 4x10 meters and 3 U-turns.	1.2218438649910532
The patients' gait quality under stimulation was compared with their free walk (velocity, number of steps, number of freezing episodes).	1.0008917539550206
Metronome stimulation significantly reduced the time and number of steps needed for the test course and also diminished the number of freezing episodes.	1.0598417998675285
March music stimulation was less effective and tactile stimulation (rhythmically tapping on the patient's shoulder) even produced negative results.	0.9368955586923501
The positive effect of metronome stimulation was also found, when the tests were not performed inside the hospital building, but outside in the hospital parc.	1.196680144436623
Metronome stimulation was comparably effective in both patient sub-groups examined in this study (M. Parkinson, Parkinson-plus-syndrome) and seems to be an important additional help in the treatment of these patients.	1.1749878893078147
Electronical metronomes are not expensive, easy in handling, and portable.	0.9890274827850062
A theoretical explanation of metronome stimulation effectivity in patients with Parkinson's disease still needs to be elucidated.	0.7391761246228553
The occurrence of perineural epithelial complexes within the pancreas cannot always be regarded as evidence of malignancy.	0.8095687971941348
Chronic pancreatitis can induce alterations in the anatomy of the organ with a histological picture comparable to that of neural invasion.	0.9788236761680867

Deciduosis of the appendix is a rare cause of acute appendicitis in pregnancy.	1.0946857981153992
Ectopic decidual cells localized in the submesothelial stroma may represent a physiologic reaction of the pluripotent stromal cells to progestational hormonal stimulation.	0.7769803104103927
Less frequently, deciduosis is based on a preexisting extragenital endometriosis, visible in a localization other than strictly submesothelial, in residuals of cyclic proliferation and bleeding, and in endometrial glandular formations embedded in the decidual cells.	1.0711651268547238
In 14 patients with acute LBP the effect of manual therapy was examined.	1.0520942953646253
The examination was conducted with the Triflexometer, which is an electromechanical measuring instrument for examination of the posture and function of the spine.	1.1298917038164136
This instrument makes possible the measurement of the spine in resting as well as in moving positions, and it is also suitable for recording local disturbances of the movement.	1.2371866995548872
In our study we measured the spine from C7 to S2 in the sagittal and frontal planes.	1.004650260447608
Improvement in movement was detected in all patients following manual therapy, as well as in ante-, retro- and lateral flexion on both sides, and local functional disturbances also disappeared partially or totally.	1.208831672219128
Our study shows that the Triflexometer makes it possible to record the effect of manual therapy in acute LBP.	0.9125677097464445
The proof of the local functional disturbances after manual therapy indicates that these patients have a higher risk of new episodes of acute LBP or perhaps of chronic LBP, and because of that there it is necessary to use other treatment forms.	1.1131865890839963
Diagnostic imaging after renal transplantation is of high importance in the differential diagnosis of peri-and postoperative complications.	0.9579310241397806

In the follow up period (6 - 9 months), 72% of the patients had improved or were without complaints.	1.4693660438248937
The validity of the applied diagnostic parameters relating to a successful operation were disappointing especially the ultrasonic flow measurement.	0.9235102657205143
In our opinion, exact anamnesis and sufficient angiography are decisive for the indication of vertebral surgery.	0.8628497139730374
It has long been a goal to develop a means to measure squint angles in three dimensions simultaneously.	0.8627659361798385
A three-dimensional binocular method is naturally needed especially with surgical procedures that affect three dimensions of ocular motility.	0.903704772908148
In situations of depressed myocardial function, the role of immunological mechanisms has been studied recently.	0.8964381104785062
In different pathophysiological situations, such as chronic heart failure, open heart surgery with extracorporal circulation, cardiac transplantation, myocardial infarction and angina pectoris, patterns have been described with elevation of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and reversible myocardial dysfunction, which may represent a final common pathway.	1.201853697586008
The available data suggest a modulation of important determinants of pump function, i.e., contractility, preload, afterload, and heart rate, by cytokines.	1.1320615450481863
Potential mechanisms include the -adrenoceptor- and nitric oxide pathway, as well as a direct impact on intracellular calcium homeostasis.	1.1318170714675282
Interventional strategies based on this understanding are beginning to emerge.	0.8148055452060664
A prospective randomized study was designed to determine the effect of postoperative water contact on tissue healing.	0.9329922039396342
A total of 121 patients undergoing open hernia repair was divided into two groups.	0.8575020289977261
The first group was permitted to shower postoperatively, allowing the wound to come into direct contact with the water, the second group was instructed to keep the incision dry.	1.0203871888631921
Water contact, wound healing and patient satisfaction were assessed.	0.8460930194722156
There was no difference in wound healing between the two groups and no manifest infection.	1.0858470079022575
In children and adolescents motor/vocal tics and obsessive-compulsive behavior are known to be closely related.	0.8503080842926745
Thereby, a continuum of symptoms ranging from single tics to a mixed picture of tics/rituals/obsessive-compulsive traits to clinically relevant obsessions and compulsions could be described.	0.9271676814107471
As neurobiological substrates dysfunctions in corresponding cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits (sensorimotor circuit in tic symptomatology, orbitofrontal circuit in obsessive-compulsive behavior) were postulated.	0.8364136106416761
For both disturbances behavioral therapy can be used to improve control mechanisms to counterregulate tics and obsessive-compulsive behavior, respectively, and psychopharmacological agents can be administerd to compensate dysbalances in neurotransmitter systems.	0.9427933321000557
In case of a mixed symptomatologic picture it is necessary to include interventions for both pols of the symptom-continuum in the therapeutic programme to achieve extensive improvement as a basis for a further positive development of the patient.	1.0972908161539017
As laparoscopic cholecystectomy becomes more established, interest in legal aspects increases.	0.8227421061313037
The legal cases dealt with in Germany since the introduction of this laparoscopic method in 1989 were studied to determine the legal consequences of complications.	0.9281569348149694
Of 40 cases, 16 were judged to be cases of malpractice, whereas 24 were not.	0.9153776523036414
The most common cause was injury of the common bile duct (26 cases).	1.0805018220132814
Seven of these 26 cases were judged to be cases of malpractice, 2 of these as grave errors.	0.8914463957417839
The main reasons for the acceptance of a case as malpractice were delay in changing to conventional cholecystectomy, delayed revision, laparoscopic revisions and not reverting to conventional cholecystectomy in unclear situations.	1.025537914970969
Purpose of this review is, to highlight key issues in transplantation medicine today and to summarise basic information on current state of perfused organ transplantation.	1.1024034483510843
There is special emphasis on ethical and legal considerations with regard to living donor transplantation, brain death concept, donor consent and organ allocation.	0.9961583963786091
Transplantation frequencies and the impact of whole organ transplantation on the treatment concept for patients with end stage organ disease is heavily dependent on donor and organ availability.	1.0076785889555016
Organ donor rate of 25 to 30 donors per million inhabitants per year seems to yield sufficient organ supply for patients on renal replacement therapy.	0.8797563440679419
15 to 20 liver transplantations per million inhabitants per year, my be sufficient, to cover the need of organs for non malignant end stage liver diseases.	0.9446984524542009
This frequency my be achieved by increasing donor rates and employing "split techniques", where one liver is used for two recipients.	1.1846744657627153
One year graft survival in kidney transplantation can be expected to be between 85 and 90 %, one year patient survival in heart and liver transplantation can be expected to be beyond 80 %.	1.1459903123526456
The risk of organ failure is highest in the first year, long term results are dependent on incidence of chronic rejection, comorbidity of the patient and original disease.	1.2891831658589414
Patient- and/or graft loss after the first year is in the order of 1 to 5 %.	1.1758267429686893
Whole organ transplantation for kidneys, hearts and livers are considered routine procedures, lung transplantation is reaching standard phase, pancreas and combined pancreas kidney transplantation is well established technically, but its indication is still controversial.	1.0353672871073802
Laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy (LITT) is a promising method of treating different types of tumors.	0.9284710529472454
To increase the effectiveness of LITT, a new thermo-controlled application system for minimal invasive intervention was designed.	1.0408677704262486
This laser system consists of a laser applicator 3 mm in diameter, insertion equipment and an Nd:YAG laser source.	0.892801826671375
The power of the laser source is controlled dynamically by thermosensors in a water-cooling system of the laser applicator.	0.9927066634608323
In in vivo experiments in five pigs, within 10 min we found homogeneous coagulation regions in the liver that were of 3 cm and 5 cm in diameter.	1.1204855197968027
Via ultrasound we observed in real time the increasing coagulation zone that appeared as a hyperechogenic halo.	0.8862536525212021
However, due to perifocal edema, the real coagulation area was smaller than detected by ultrasound.	1.1417414202344511
Macroscopically and microscopically, the coagulation zones showed well-demarcated borders of the coagulation lesions, and the surrounding tissue appeared vital.	1.2262369441900534
The reparative reaction after irradiation was early fibrosis.	0.6624170122027154
In the course of 4 weeks, the surrounding scar capsule, containing fibrocytes, biliary ductules and collagen fibers enlarged.	0.987721567434575
As a result, the coagulation necrosis became more and more fragmented between collagen fibers and was largely resorbed.	0.9793332311625417
The absence of complications in our animal experiments suggest that the technique of thermo-controlled laser light application is safe and useful in therapy for metastases that are not resectable.	1.0286242594343113
Attachment theory, originally developed by John Bowlby, becomes increasingly relevant in the field of psychotherapy (research).	0.9162061141279927
This review starts with a definition of central concepts and hypotheses of this theory and summarizes results regarding the development as well as correlates of attachment, mainly from research in developmental psychology.	1.0170128921319326
Related to adults, attachment theory has to be reconceptualized which is done in another part of this paper.	1.0090706982187885
Finally, some common methods for the assessment of adult attachment are described which play an important role in clinical studies (these will be the content of the part 2 of this review).	1.2543225119327512
Inflammation-mediated osteopenia is an animal model for bone mass reduction following chronic inflammation.	0.93450080872546
We found a reduction of calcitriol serum concentrations during the inflammatory process, in addition cytokines are increased.	1.159858020523957
Treatment of the animals with calcitriol is able to prevent bone mass reduction and to preserve bone formation.	0.9756551541667877
Anxiolysis with drugs and psychoprophylaxis are both recognised methods of preoperative preparation.	0.7795038386852836
The beneficial effects of anxiolytics, however, appear to be difficult to prove.	0.971857504380098
In this study a comparison was made of heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and norepinephrine, epinephrine, and cortisol levels.	1.260101386615424
In group I 19 children recieved only psychological treatment, while in group II 21 children received 0.2 mg/kg midazolam orally.	1.0850939379615672
Measuring points were directly before medication, 30 min afterward, and at induction of anaesthesia.	1.164054145606514
During the observation period the patients (5-10 years old) remained calm.	1.148703597138922
At the beginning of the study the parameters of all patients were within a normal range; 30 min after premedication the HR and BP were significantly higher in group I than in group II.	1.356820654112088
In contrast to group I, epinephrine levels in group II were lower at the beginning of anaesthesia than before premedication.	1.146492537586697
In both groups, norepinephrine levels were the same at induction of anaesthesia as before premedication.	0.8487245830551458
Cortisol decreased only in patients who received midazolam.	1.2671975161550586
HR, BP, as well as humoral stress parameters indicate that midazolam in a dose of 0.2 mg/kg orally is sufficient to reduce preoperative stress in children.	0.9254205531278714
A case of isolated right ventricular myocardial tuberculoma with pericardial effusions is presented.	0.9672870187120385
The diagnosis of myocardial tuberculoma was initially suggested by echocardiography and later by magnetic resonance imaging.	1.0400861784297535
The diagnosis of cardiac tuberculosis was confirmed by demonstration of tubercle bacilli in the pericardial fluid.	0.8610803936933262
This is a very rare condition which is usually diagnosed only by necropsy.	1.1640953669831788
Myocardial tuberculoma should figure on the list of intraparietal masses visualized at echocardiography.	0.6757043722601299
The incidence of hepatitis A infections has decreased due to improved hygienic conditions in Germany.	0.878278751445331
However, hepatitis A is one of the most important diseases imported to the country.	1.3380665219418975
Currently, more than the half of all registered hepatitis A infections are acquired in foreign countries.	1.1137544397010146
According to the decreased morbidity over the past few decades most younger people (age below 50 years) are not immunized and, subsequently, this age group is at higher risk during exposure in foreign countries.	1.2438562406264868
Therefore, a hepatitis A vaccination is recommended before travelling in countries with a higher incidence of hepatitis A (Southern Europe, Africa, South America, and Asia).	1.1037090333568191
Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) are a group of Gram-positive organism, which have in common a fermentative metabolism with lactic acid as the major end-product.	1.1858416097975994
Except for bifidobacteria, the LAB are phylogenetically closely related.	0.8726964270399767
They directly contribute to human well-being as they are the most important germs in the production process of fermented foods which constitute one fourth of our diet.	1.0750666338756205
They are, furthermore, an essential component of the mucosal flora and especially of the intestinal flora.	1.21457955982226
The genus Streptococcus contains highly pathogenic species which can be clearly differentiated from the useful germs.	0.8854982315199554
The intestinal flora contains such species of the genus Lactobacillus that are also important in food fermentation and species which are strongly adapted to the intestines and therefore, can be found exclusively in this ecological niche.	1.0874714374448964
A special status characterises bifidobacteria and enterococci.	0.663201577879919
The former are located in a separate phylogenetic branch and also occur virtually exclusively in the intestines.	0.9186481208531284
Enterococci are rather ubiquitous, participate in indigenous food fermentations, are found in the mucosal flora and are counted as opportunistic pathogens.	0.9627010507991056
To influence the intestinal flora and to achieve health promoting effects LAB are isolated from the intestinal flora, grown and employed either as pharmaceutical preparations or additions to food (usually fermented milk).	0.9454822810014019
These bacteria are termed "probiotics".	0.6729848570570215
The exposition of consumers to high numbers of germs belonging to one or a few species needs an evaluation of their safety for human health.	0.8364813062807955
In this process the traditional experience with the safe nature of the species can serve as an important criterion.	1.0322081300518822
In front of this background, LAB in probiotics can be considered to be especially safe, nevertheless some restrictions have to be made.	0.9556836200000133
Generally, the germs used should not contain genes encoding transmissible resistance to antibiotics.	0.897115480156468
In addition they should not produce biogenic amines (e.g.	0.5543976448637981
histamine, tyrosine or phenylethylamine) and should not degrade mucine.	1.0132933805636166
The assessment may also include the following: absence of a potential for deconjugation of bile salts, induction of platelet aggregation and binding to fibrinogen and fibronectine.	0.948240057484815
These examinations may be required as certain LAB have been identified in clinical isolates.	1.0324498894347673
The isolates were, however, obtained in the most majority of cases from debilitated patients.	1.2096605745985678
The germs were components of the body flora as well as of the environment, organisms deliberately employed in food fermentations or probiotics have never been isolated.	1.0520174329502745
Dural sinus thrombosis is not uncommon.	0.517319681361322
Due to the nonspecific symptomatology, as well as the manifold etiology, clinical diagnosis may be difficult.	1.1773568864502604
In these cases imaging procedures are frequently crucial in deciding how to proceed and how to treat.	0.9790228924558971
The aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic utility of helical CT in the detection of dural sinus thrombosis.	0.8634835356171504
In 20 patients with clinically suspected thrombosis CT angiography was performed.	0.9223395413040602
In 6 patients dural sinus thrombosis was diagnosed.	0.8013813185226056
In order to acquire also arterial vessels, a short delay of about 22 s after the onset of the application of contrast medium was selected.	1.1439576882845226
By this method we found an occlusion of the MCA in two patients with clinically suspected sinus thrombosis.	1.1486558857255182
In all patients the transverse slices and the multiplanar reconstructions showed filling defects or an "empty delta" sign.	0.9541328348909396
With irregular outlines the thrombus could be depicted over the complete course of the sinus.	0.9897719172296302
The MIP reconstructions were particularly helpful in the evaluation of the vessel anatomy and the pathological collateral venous drainage.	0.9551009642093078
In three patients MR angiograms were available for comparison.	0.8170250987538779
The smaller veins, such as the v. vermis inferior, were less clearly depicted than in CT angiography.	1.0824537295097338
CT angiography is a fast and reliable method to exclude or verify a sinus thrombosis.	0.8899582740035643
It can be performed immediately after non-enhanced CT.	0.9813438019125702
According to our present experience CT angiography is sufficient for the diagnosis of a sinus thrombosis.	1.0878841929712082
Coronary angiography ist considered to be the most important component in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease.	1.0190028150157286
Only the lumen may be visualized using contrast radiography of the coronary arteries, however.	0.898697673813967
With intravascular ultrasound, on the other hand, pathological changes in the vascular wall can be recorded.	0.94601778881733
Despite typical symptoms, an angiographical image of the coronary arteries is sometimes unable to show unambiguous stenotic lesions of the coronary arteries.	0.9786391955886826
In such cases, intravascular ultrasound provides a new complementary diagnostic tool for detecting even early forms of arteriosclerosis or angiographically underestimated coronary findings.	0.9513684817622822
Two cases are used to illustrate this.	0.9126897529134107
In those, angiographic visualization of the coronary arteries was unable to produce an unambiguous finding despite typical clinical symptoms, yet intravascular ultrasound could detect considerable arteriosclerotic wall changes.	0.8912553582377016
Purpose: The pontine micturition center plays a central role in regulating the micturition reflex, but the precise neural mechanisms are unclear.	1.103907183961593
The cerebral cortex is involved in coordinating micturition but there is little knowledge on specific evolutionary higher brain regions.	0.8570611515272862
The present study aimed to investigate whether cortical activation during micturition can be demonstrated by EEG power spectra patterns and to explore whether specific cortical regions involved in the interaction of inhibition and release during the micturition reflex can be discerned.	1.0338546610083503
We also aimed to test whether intravesical electrostimulation (IVES) therapy in patients with micturition disorders has an effect on patterns of cortical activity.	0.9638862800783121
Background: Indirect traumatic optic neuropathy represents a severe, potential vision-threatening disease process that requires close interdisciplinary cooperation for treatment.	1.051113323137846
In general, any therapy has been dis-cussed controversially in the literature.	0.7965194260901358
Based upon experiences with spinal cord trauma, high-dose steroid therapy is recommended initially to minimize secondary consequences following orbital trauma.	1.0010692320250942
The usefulness of surgical decompression of the optic nerve has been confirmed in several studies but is still not recommended in principle.	1.0978353802859782
In recent years there has been an increasing incidence of streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome (TSLS) in otherwise healthy adults.	1.1085619896749874
It is characterized by fever, rash, hypotension and early shock with consecutive organ failure and a mortality rate of about 30 %.	0.9620513594701879
This paper describes the history of two patients with severe streptococcal TSLS.	1.0545581560588564
Various aspects of the pathophysiology, diagnosis and therapy are discussed.	1.0534204164947674
Only early, aggressive and repeated surgical debridement can reduce the bacterial load and decrease circulating exotoxins and thereby, in combination with antibiotic therapy, decrease the high mortality of this entity.	1.0867854260026826
Purpose: To test, whether axial, coronal and sagittal MIP and MPR reconstructions of diagnostic quality can be obtained from 1-mm collimation MSCT data of the chest for the evaluation of thoracic anatomy and pathology.	1.1720232781312356
The risk to health posed by a sedentary lifestyle is a problem of our times.	0.8883234102911151
In contrast to the previous assumption that only fairly high-intensity sporting exercise undertaken over a minimum period of 20 min produces health-related benefits, recent studies have shown that even everyday activitites (climbing stairs, brisk walking and cycling) can have a benedicial effects on health, particularly in those who take little exercise.	1.1118951412559404
So now the recommendation is: exercise of moderate intensity lasting 30 min at least 5 times a week, corresponding to an energy consumption of about 150 kacl/day or 1000 kcal/week.	0.9037339471686382
The results of experimental studies on sport and arthritis and sport and osteoporosis point to the advisability of taking up or maintaining an active sporting lifestyle.	0.9301868968564465
For one thing, it can be assumed that a moderate amount of movement does not increase the risk of developing arthritis: for another, sporting activity during early and late childhood produces a high maximum bone mass, therby delaying the development of osteoporosis in later life.	1.0104888672941348
The new guidelines on the extent and intensity of health-giving exercise make it easier to advocate exercise and sport for disease prevention and health promotion because they appear to implement.	0.949597665864963
More difficult, however, is deciding on a suitable method for motivating inactive individuals to increase their level of physical acitivity.	1.0226170070568834
A model that has proved effective in smoking cessation programmes, and one that can also be applied to exercise counselling (transtheoretical model), can help in the selection of an appropriate counselling strategy.	1.2605623470134277
Depending on whether an individual is inactive, or sporadically or regularly active, each one employs his or her own strategies primarily to maintain this lifestyle.	0.97888419243525
Assuming that the counselling is adapted to the level of activity, the patient's attitude and behaviour can be influenced both more effectively and more economically.	1.1143562553398505
Background: Photorefraktive keratectomy (PRK) is the most frequent refractive surgical procedure worldwide.	1.2995747296310758
The central corneal thickness is reduced due to removal of the anterior stroma, including Bowman's layer, with a laser beam.	1.2046640645522482
This procedure results in considerable alterations of the corneal structure.	0.7587582044530262
What does this mean for the mechanical properties of the cornea?	0.8460104299738668
Beginning in the 1920s Wilhelm Reich developed the fundamental concepts of a body-oriented psychotherapy out of psychoanalysis.	0.8456558659253766
He started from considerations of egopathology, sexuality and the analysis of resistance and character patterns.	0.8326576543822445
Characterological and bodily attitudes were understood as defence-patterns against emotions, which function not only psychologically but also bodily.	0.9160776184812256
Thus he began to mobilize repressed affects through working on muscular tensions and bodily expressions.	0.6916830721390814
That way their meaning in the person's history could be understood and a self-healing process restarted.	0.932988444007926
This approach to release constrained energy is still valid for neoreichian schools such as bioenergetics, biodynamics, biosynthesis and others whose understanding of human nature and of healing processes is similar to those of other schools of humanistic psychotherapy.	0.9433487386883119
Bodily processes are used as indicators for the processes and successes of therapies.	0.9228766206913157
Besides there are impulses in modern body psychotherapies to work with the body in the relationship and transference process and attempts to reintegrate psychoanalytical concepts.	0.9794130395005738
Recurrent phlebothromboses in young patients with subsequent severe postthrombotic syndrome and chronic venous leg ulcers may be caused by underlying hereditary disorders of hemostasis or may occur as part of other congenital syndromes.	0.9020255083574126
The most common hereditary disorders of hemostasis in this respect appear to be deficiencies of antithrombin III, protein C, and protein S, and activated protein C resistance (mutations of factor V).	1.0978954344572214
Less frequently, dysfibrinogenemia, increased plasminogen activator inhibitor levels, or deficiencies of tissue plasminogen activator or heparin cofactor II may be found.	0.9854930907237279
Klinefelter's syndrome and homocystinuria are prime examples of those rare congenital disorders indirectly associated with an elevated risk of thrombosis in young individuals.	1.0055897185746627
Early diagnosis of these disorders will allow timely treatment, preventive care and counselling of patients as well as family members.	1.0831494588074917
Epidurography with contrast medium is used to verify the correct poition of an epidural catheter and to detect malpositioning.	0.99129901321987
There is great variability in the distribution of contrast medium according to the individual morphology of the epidural space and the way it is injected.	1.0493112569850114
Results of investigations of the anatomy of the spinal canal and epidural space performed with anatomic specimens, epiduroscopy, and conventional and computed tomographic (CT) epidurography are sometimes contradictory.	0.9715082506389271
We have performed CT epidurography in approximately 30 patients to date.	0.9048669659416904
Insights regarding the distribution of contrast medium in the epidural space can help to interpret conventional epidurographies and to explain special features, such as the "rail-road-track phenomenon" or the plica mediana dorsalis.	1.0969420204593308
Patients scheduled for major abdominal operations were studied.	0.7057635905286717
Catheters were introduced into the thoracic epidural space on the day before the operation.	0.7657773758181522
Conventional epidurographies were performed routinely after insertion of the catheters with a mobile X-ray apparatus, usually in the recovery room, using 5 ml iopamidol (Solutrast 250 M).	1.077393463420912
Selected patients (good mental state and stable psychic condition), after written consent and with approval of the local ethical committee, were investigated with CT epidurography using the same contrast medium (partly diluted).	1.232656851387813
From among the CT scans performed until now, five characteristic images are presented and compared to conventional epidurographies.	1.1783837311422172
When small volumes (5 mL) of iopamidol were injected slowly, we regularly observed a railroad-track phenomenon in the AP images of conventional epidurographies.	1.1738867374083535
After rapid injection of larger volumes (10 - 15 ml), the spread was more homogeneous and sometimes outline a lighter zone of contrast distribution in the midline.	1.1329850939410422
CT epidurography in these cases (5 out of 30 patients) revealed a plica mediana dorsalis.	1.2114147281761753
In the majority of the CT scans of the thoracic epidural space its anterior (ventral) compartment was unfilled by contrast medium.	1.090389921579925
According to the findings of several investigators, dura mater and ligamentum longitudinale posterius have grown together, so that an epidural space does not exist in ventral thoracic segments of the spinal canal.	1.0065374408413097
In lower thoracic and lumbar segments both structures are separate, and a wide anterior epidural space was present and filled with contrast medium.	1.1459359721359763
In other cases the dorsal and dorsolateral epidural space was completely filled, but the contrast medium stopped behind the spinal nerves and surrounding dural sheaths, as if these structures, together with the connective tissue strands between them, formed a membrane that spread in a frontal plane.	1.081967367153163
A railroad-track phenomenon is interpreted in the literature as the X-ray correlate of contrast medium spread in the subdural space, indicating an incorrect catheter position.	1.058365540774059
According to conventional epidurographies and confirmed by CT scans, this feature is also seen regulary in cases with correct catheter position.	1.1181747373171491
Small volumes of iopamidol spread preferentially into the wider parts of the epidural space between the gaps of the vertebral arcs, whereas the dura mater and periosteal layers touch at the inner side of the pedicules and laminae, allowing the existence of only a potential epidural space.	1.0662107475351914
This rhythmic widening and narrowing of the epidural space is the explanation of the "railroad track" in AP contrast epidurographies.	0.908777791824283
CT epidurography is a valuable tool to provide better insight into the morphology of the epidural space when filled with fluid (contrast medium, local anaesthetics), complementing findings using epiduroscopy and anatomic specimens.	1.022011780964596
It stands to reason that this time- and cost-expensive method can never replace conventional epidurographies, but can help to interpret them properly.	1.1792329681753297
A 71-year-old woman suffered from pronounced erosion of her nose after soft X-ray therapy (total dose 28 Gy, half dose depth 10.5-11.5 mm).	1.1154502167805225
5 weeks after the end of the irradiation no healing tendency was observed.	0.8765693506451695
This unusual clinical course was caused by a simultaneously existing pemphigus vulgaris that worsened after radiotherapy, presumably as a consequence of the release of epidermal antigens.	0.9371967180650611
In this case it is improbable that the pemphigus was induced by the radiotherapy, as has been reported on several occasions in the literature.	1.1430137791987693
However, this possibility cannot be entirely excluded.	1.122046488965038
A vascular etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been long debated.	0.8825986488480502
In order to search for an ischemic basis of PD we assessed the clinical symptomatology of a consecutive group of 60 PD patients and compaired their frequency of cerebrovascular risk factors, carotid atherosclerosis and ischemic brain lesions with age-matched groups of stroke patients and normals.	1.017406455931877
There were 16 (27%) subjects with PD who also had symptoms of cerebrovascular disease.	1.0872588921916333
The frequencies of carotid stenoses, ischemic brain lesions and most of cerebrovascular risk factors seen in the latter group was comparable with those of stroke patients and significantly higher than in the investigational subsets of patients with "pure" PD and normals.	1.0559941986309684
Only one (1.6%) individual with PD presented signs suggestive of an ischemic etiology of parkinsonism.	1.2222810647223434
These findings suggest that cerebrovascular disease occurs in approximately one fourth of patients with PD, but seldomly is causally related.	0.9679072993815596
Neurological involvement is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with sarcoidosis.	1.022951856873673
The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of patients with neurosarcoidosis.	0.910186004902243
The MRI brain scans of 22 patients with sarcoidosis were retrospectively reviewed, along with the clinical information provided in the request form.	0.9707656321005751
All patients had signs and symptoms referable to the head and were examined with gadolinium enhancement.	1.2062813374565726
Cranial (facial) nerve paralysis was the most common clinical manifestation identified in 10 patients.	1.2241666523827615
A wide spectrum of MR findings was noted: periventricular and white matter lesions on T2 W spin echo images, mimicking multiple sclerosis (46%); multiple supratentorial and infratentorial brain lesions, mimicking metastases (36%); solitary intraaxial mass, mimicking high-grade astrocytoma (9%); solitary extraaxial mass, mimicking meningioma (5%); leptomeningeal enhancement (36%).	1.0944029344534236
The diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis is often difficult, particularly so in patients who lack either pulmonary or systemic manifestations of sarcoidosis.	1.1002806401187364
MRI shows a wide spectrum of brain abnormalities associated with neurosarcoidosis.	0.8214856157118399
These findings, however, are not specific for sarcoidosis and one must consider appropriate clinical circumstances in arriving at the correct diagnosis.	1.0881560447491088
In selected cases with isolated brain involvement, meningeal or cerebral biopsy may be required.	0.8346727926069812
In 1990, we first described the papular-purpuric "gloves and socks" syndrome (PPGSS).	0.7051225097390494
It is characterized by an itching erythema and edema of the hands and feet together with oral mucosal lesions and fever.	0.7920659959657322
The skin  lesions subsequently become purpuric and resolve spontaneously after a few days.	0.746246087415941
In more than half of the patients, an acute parvovirus B 19 infection has been proven.	0.9478766680888436
In a few cases of PPGSS, other viral infections have been found, for example hepatitis B and measles.	1.2569668085062957
We report on a patient with PPGSS and review the literature.	0.8982324164666392
Fungus-bezoars in the renal pelvis are an unusual manifestation of severe Candida albicans infection.	0.8416818990629009
A newborn infant with VACTERL-association suffered from fungus balls in the renal pelvis after Candida albicans sepsis, and developed a hydronephrosis with beginning postrenal failure.	0.8649964805438597
Following systemic antimycotic therapy with amphotericin B and flucytosin as well as local irrigation with amphotericin B via percutaneous nephrostomy renal function normalised rapidly.	0.8205366501987104
Discussion: Since the incidence of systemic mycotic infection in neonates becomes more common the differential diagnosis of nephrolithiasis should include fungus balls.	1.1033358877480184
Interactional understanding in psychoanalysis, especially the concept of the 'third point', suggests that the development of insight, empathy and relationship are dimensions of one and the same triangulating process peculiar to psychoanalytic understanding.	1.091949594479657
In this context the psychoanalytic method, here understood as working with resistance, transference and countertransference, does not only offer a route to cognition, but also to the formation of a conflict-solving, egostrengthening, and supportive relationship peculiar to psychoanalysis.	1.0915275672353832
The formula 'interpretation on the basis of countertransference' describes a form of psychoanalytic interpretation that takes up this context intentionally and can thus also be used for crisis intervention in the case of neurotic conflicts.	1.0611421473851856
This is exemplified by a case history.	0.8667854209489587
The Dutch Supreme Court ruled that in exceptional instances, physician-assisted suicide might be justifiable for patients with unbearable mental suffering but no physical illness.	0.8373205401782378
A recent report shows that explicit requests for physician-assisted suicide are not uncommon in psychiatric practice in the Netherlands.	0.9546050511753946
Some of those requests were granted and their medical background was described.	0.7829489960544005
Psychiatric consultation for medical patients who request physician-assisted suicide is relatively rare.	0.8824226510183137
Pemphigus is a rare intraepidermal autoimmune bullous disease.	0.8781431841728146
Two major variants, pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF), are distinguished.	1.142069224553978
The aim of this study was to document the clinical and immunpathological findings in all pemphigus patients who were diagnosed in the Department of Dermatology at the University of Würzburg over the past 10 years.	1.1339950721696481
Post-dural puncture headache (PDPH) is a significant complication of spinal anaesthesia.	1.1416335334160468
Diameter and tip of the needle as well as the patient's age have been proven to be important determinants.	1.277473501843836
The question of whether post-operative recumbency can reduce the risk of PDPH has not been answered uniformly.	0.9885307982711534
And besides, some studies referring to this subject reveal methodical failures, for example, as to clear definition and exact documentation of post-operative immobilization.	1.0840102963331413
Furthermore, fine-gauge needles (26G or more) have not been investigated yet.	1.1281401394249593
The first aim of our study was therefore to examine the role of recumbency in the prevention of PDPH under controlled conditions using thin needles.	0.9916906941371612
Secondly, we wanted to confirm the reported prophylactic effect of needles with a modified, atraumatic tip (Whitacre and Atraucan) by comparing them to Quincke needles of identical diameter.	1.050721845799092
Most of the former investigators compared Quincke with atraumatic needles of different size regardless of the known influence of the diameter on PDPH.	1.0600763165369302
Three characteristic developments in modern western societies usually are considered to be independent variables in the ethical discussion:...	1.002171167028599
Background: Neuropathic pain syndromes may be treated by intervention at the sympathetic nervous system.	1.2072182106397773
The pain in these syndromes is therefore called sympathetically maintained pain (SMP).	0.7419348889989505
Typical disorders with a SMP component are complex regional pain syndromes (reflex sympathetic dystrophy and causalgia), traumatic neuralgias and herpes zoster.	1.058685016077027
The tendency towards sphincter-preserving resection for distal rectal cancers has led to a revival of the technique of coloanal anastomosis (CAA) in recent years.	0.9406272170814564
In order to improve functional results, creation of a colonic J-pouch in conjunction with a coloanal anastomosis (CPA) was proposed.	0.9490858041621169
Two different operation techniques exist: i) Double-stapling with the anastomosis close to the dentate line and ii) intersphincteric resection with the anastomosis located immediately at the dentate line.	1.0760644483894042
A long rectal remnant after double-stapling leads to urgency in 15 % of the patients due to stool retention in the atonic remnant.	0.9408503844129691
No propulsive motility patterns were recorded from the pouch which is emptyed passively by upper colonic peristalsis.	0.7918213168095645
Therefore colonic pouches should be fashionned of descending colon and should not exceed a length of 6 cm in order to prevent stool fragmentation.	1.052285337247796
Under these conditions the average stool frequency is reduced from 2-6 /d after CAA to 1-3 /d after CPA.	1.1615460111837803
This effect is maximal during the first postoperative months, but is still significant after 3 years.	1.332910272740876
Colonic pouch construction also leads, due to better blood supply and prevention of pelvic hematomas, to a significant decrease of the anastomotic insufficiency rate from 10,0 % after CAA to 5,4 % after CPA.	1.3197286427839385
Therefore creation of a colonic J-pouch should be combined with coloanal reconstruction if the oncologic situation allows a sphincter-preserving procedure.	0.7653508538228464
Background: Workers in the construction industry carry an increased risk for head and neck cancer due to the high consumption of alcohol and tobacco plus exposure to occupational carcinogenic or co-carcinogenic agents.	1.1802202012241685
These latter substances include asbestos, tar products, metal dust, wood dust, cement dust and paints.	0.7593412909839409
Presently, there are no well-defined standards for documentation of echocardiographic studies.	1.1811964316211538
Nevertheless, standards are essential to provide comparability of data and to realize electronic communication, both essential for quality management in echocardiography.	1.2332301098941003
Embolia cutis medicamentosa (Nicolau Syndrom) is a very rare complication of intramuscular injections which presents with extensive necrosis of the injected skin area.	1.0720267862700301
Intra-arterial and/or para-arterial injections after prior perforation of certain vessels are discussed as possible pathogenetic mechanisms.	0.9266837076548787
We describe the occurrence of embolia cutis medicamentosa after intra-articular injections into the knee.	0.9823397998003245
In a 30-beds-unit of the Orthopedic University Clinic in Bochum for an example we studied the frequency of combined injection therapy with local anesthesia and chirotherapy in a one year period.	1.046997801870336
There have been done 191 injections into ileosacral joints as well as 28 injections into facett joints of the cervical spine and additionally 315 into facett joints of the lumbar spine.	0.9102638703428695
On the other side there have been done 122 chirotherapeutic maneuvers at cervical, thoracic or lumbar spine by senior doctors with education in manual medicine.	1.062871089106511
The injection therapy however was done in mean predilection sites of the patients suffering from cervical spine disorders or low back pain, the chirotherapy was done in other spine areas.	1.1435899248655803
The growing number of doctors with an education in manual medicine seems to improve the chirotherapy of the mean pathology as well, but it is not able to reduce the number of local injection therapy.	1.1081962286064162
In a retrospective case control study at the University of Frankfurt, Germany, 101 babies born to opiate-addicted mothers were identified from birth charts from 1988 to 1995.	0.961292475903965
After birth, they developed a withdrawal syndrome (neonatal abstinence syndrome).	0.915020027112188
Fifty control infants and their mothers were selected from neonatal wards.	0.8424654718679125
The group of opiate-exposed babies was subdivided into a group born to mothers without methadone treatment (n=48) and a group born to mothers who were enrolled in a methadone program (n=51).	0.9569954501561779
The methadone infants had a significantly higher mean birth weight (2822 g) than children in the group without methadone (2471 g).	1.122899795384005
The abstinence syndrome was much more intense in the methadone group (convulsions 47.1%) than in heroin-exposed babies without methadone treatment (convulsions 27.1%).	0.9927248050275004
Women in methadone maintenance programs lived in more stable socioeconomic conditions than opiate-addicted women without methadone substitution.	0.7982916009059121
Moreover, they cared significantly better for their babies: 81.3% of the methadone mothers visited their children on a regular basis and 90.9% cared adequately.	1.2345726815836893
The data emphasize the need in future research to look more closely at the role of methadone treatment programs in the development of opiate-exposed babies.	0.9246728170615672
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease of high penetrance and variable expression.	1.1508482172524743
Epidemiologic data on craniofacial manifestations are still lacking.	0.6373605218541376
Up until now 74 patients with NF1 have been treated at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of the University of Hamburg.	1.0713699196593274
Forty-two patients presented periorbital and orbital neurofibromas varying in extension and in the severity of findings of the affected site.	1.1271703797979695
Surgical therapy is mainly based on tumour reduction, frequently combined with face-lifting.	0.9158783623709921
In our experience neurofibromas of the neck tend to be pseudo-encapsulated, facilitating the preparation of the tumour.	1.085777537575126
On the other hand, identification and preparation of diffuse infiltrating neurofibromas in the trigeminal nerve region are difficult and local recurrence must be expected.	0.9043116135464312
Objective: The revised Edwards-Duromedics valve was introduced onto the market in June 1990.	0.8697188191383939
In September 1993, the producer changed the name of the valve to TEKNA, which is a low profile, bileaflet, mechanical prosthesis with a self-irrigating hinge mechanism.	1.0991869492255246
The results of a prospective follow-up study after valve replacement with this prosthesis are presented.	1.3806029503421788
A granular cell tumor is one of the rare tumors of the esophagus.	1.0388568680339614
We present the case of a 65-year-old male patient, who was admitted to our hospital for an elective cholecystectomy.	1.0083666871256105
In the routine diagnostic gastroscopy an intramural tumor in the distal esophagus was incidentally found.	0.9546346472945905
Repeated endoscopic biopsies did not reveal the histologic diagnosis, although endoscopic ultrasound invasion to the tunica muscularis could not be excluded.	1.0337034025693452
After indicating the operative therapy, the tumor was removed through a thoracoscopic approach.	1.0111998646095874
The histologic specimen showed a granular cell tumor of the esophagus (tumor of Abrikossoff).	0.9298237453915279
Since the tumor grade was unknown, our therapy seemed to be justified because of the low risk involved in minimally invasive operative procedures.	1.0944588978073908
There has been much discussion and controversy in the literature on this subject, including the potential for malignancy and the correct therapy regime, with a general shift to conservative or minimally invasive treatment.	1.3458772899060014
The case is discussed with a review of the literature.	0.9303117269349026
This review deals with the differential diagnosis and treatment of critically ill neuromuscular patients.	0.7741238177504756
Acute muscular weakness may be a sign of newly acquired neuromuscular disorders or of an exacerbation of a previously existing disease.	0.9531600514866618
Typical features of the more common neuromuscular conditions are presented and the problems of neurocritical care delineated.	1.071534838243182
The appropriate ancillary tests are presented.	0.5295206759569039
Psychiatric care for chronic schizophrenic patients has improved in recent years, but for severely ill patients, often with multiple comorbid psychiatric conditions and in great need of care, the situation remains unsatisfactory.	1.095068573321714
Community-based psychiatric care is limited and psychiatric hospitals are now cutting back on inpatient care.	0.9010286056793293
The quality of care that chronically mentally ill patients receive at independant psychiatric nursing homes removed from population centers is undetermined, and many patients end up in asylums or homeless shelters unable to provide for their psychiatric needs.	0.9276703547419616
Neither a reliable way to assess the needs of these complicated patients nor a scientific basis for therapeutic intervention exists yet.	0.9556787805298235
A diagnostic scoring system, recently published by Ohmann et al.	0.8260282556906093
in this journal, was validated by analyzing the clinicopathological data of a consecutive series of 2,359 patients, admitted for suspicion of acute appendicitis.	1.0374512667168356
The results of the scoring system were compared to the results of clinical evaluation by junior (provisional) and senior surgeons (final clinical diagnosis).	1.1126247929025492
To assess the diagnostic ability of the score, the accuracy and positive predictive value were defined as the major diagnostic performance parameters; the rate of theoretical negative laparotomies and that of diagnostic errors served as the major procedural performance parameters.	1.1571556920746504
Of 2,359 patients admitted for suspected acute appendicitis, 662 were proven to have acute appendicitis by histology, for a prevalence of 28 %.	0.9723617032246465
The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of the provisional clinical diagnosis were 0.50, 0.94, 0.77, 0.83, and 0.82; 0.93, for the score 0.63, 0.93, 0.77, 0.86 and 0.84, and for the final clinical diagnosis 0.90, 0.94, 0.85, 0.96, and 0.93, respectively.	1.2320077412420194
Of the main diagnostic performance parameter, the accuracy of the score was signifianctly better than that of provisional clinical diagnosis (P < 0.05, 2 test).	1.00459864923721
The score yielded a rate of negative appendecomies and laparotomies of 14.3 and 12.3 %.	0.8910529345786853
With respect to the rate of overlooked cases of acute apendicitis, the score demonstrated a superior performance, with only 6 cases missed (0.9 %).	1.193934933069987
However, the number of patients with acute appendicitis, including those with perforated disease, who were not identified by the score, was almost four times that of the final clinical diagnosis (245 vs 63).	1.2230169921787624
With regard to the main procedural performance parameter, the score resulted in a significantly smaller number of diagnostic errors than the provisional clinical investigator (P < 0.05, 2 test).	0.9859001502289717
The results of this study indicate that the diagnostic scoring system might be helpful when experienced investigators or additional diagnostic modalities such as ultrasonography are not available.	1.118478801818701
It may therefore be of value in the preclinical evaluation of patients with suspected acute appendicitis and may be instrumental as a quality control tool and in clinical guidelines.	1.0693279703189054
Purpose: The standards and regulations concerning the protection of patients and operator staff within the context of MRI are compiled.	1.1740409817535131
Resulting consequences regarding physical parameters are evaluated.	0.6290196605796863
Replacement of the tracheal conduit remains an unresolved problem.	0.673730801437963
The microporous material expanded polytetrafluorethylene (ePTFE) is suitable for tracheal reconstruction.	0.9063620587403503
The aim of our study was to improve the limited mechanical properties of this material by incorporating reinforcement elements and to examine the influence of these elements on host incorporation and epithelialization.	1.1003895140740205
In so dours ePTFE prostheses were reinforced with Ionomer cement and porous high density polyethylene (pHDPE) rings and implanted into the neck muscle of miniature pigs.	0.7827186683702405
One of these prostheses was epithelialized by a cell seeding technique and was thus placed into a tracheal defect.	0.9658363678806305
Results were examined grossly by endoscopy and than by light and scanning electron microscopy.	0.826706410447518
The shapes of both types of prostheses showed a high stability.	0.8801353394937704
The reinforcement elements did not impair bioincorporation or the ability to epithelialize.	0.7342256022010042
In vivo interposition of an incorporated and epithelialized prosthesis to a host led to cell differentiation.	0.7654116247062368
The improved biomechanical properties of the prostheses waid and the reproducible formation of epitheliums are important advances in the solution of effectively correcting tracheal defects.	0.9239552518076017
Primary infection with human herpesviruses 6 and 7 (HHV-6 and HHV-7) during early childhood causes permanent latent infection, usually without any ill effects; only a small percentage of primary infections will lead to exanthem subitum.	1.0843326922820677
Like other herpesviruses, HHV-6 and HHV-7 can be reactivated at any time if host defence mechanisms become defective (e.g.	0.7468412291381784
in transplant recipients, AIDS, tumour patients).	0.8018888104991705
HHV-6 can be reactivated under such conditions and cause a variety of clinical problems, such as exanthems along with interstitial pneumonia or hepatitis for example.	0.9887499398397829
In addition, the reactivated virus may influence the course of autoimmune and proliferative diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and Hodgkin's disease.	0.9556337159705875
While, HHV-7 may be associated with similar disorders, more systematic studies are needed to clarify the clinical implications and the pathogenetic mechanisms of both viruses.	1.0263516919723559
Pulmonary artery catheterization (PAC) is widely used for monitoring and optimization of hemodynamic therapy in critically ill patients.	0.9478327485610427
Despite its widespread use there is no clear evidence that morbidity and mortality can be reduced by this approach.	1.0925744938097728
In contrast, it has been suggested that PAC might increase mortality.	1.1003725201055912
Available data do not allow the definitive omission of PAC in medical intensive care, nor do they justify its widespread use.	0.8900711320729423
Possible reasons that might affect outcome are catheter-related complications and often misinterpretation due to insufficient knowledge about PAC.	1.0271798352517212
Open questions on the influence of PAC on outcome variables in critically ill patients have to be answered by conducting randomized controlled trials.	1.0038418022229803
Beforehand, knowledge about PAC has to be improved.	0.9475804021881996
As a consequence, PAC should be performed whenever a specific hemodynamic question arises that cannot be answered by clinical judgement or by less invasive means.	0.9911586553110338
It is important that the investigator be experienced in catheter placement and data interpretation to avoid harm to these critically ill patients.	0.8807669341394732
A long-term goal of assisted reproduction techniques should be the development of methods which are able to replace the high-dose stimulation with gonadotropins in order to limit the costs and risks of in vitro fertilization treatment.	1.1219512746786753
The in vitro maturation of immature oocytes derived from follicular aspirates and the in vitro growth of early follicles isolated from ovary biopsies are discussed as possible alternatives.	0.9745113015773176
Both methods are able to shift the application of stimulating hormones from the in vivo to an in vitro level, but are today still far away from being established in clinical routine.	1.0989284028418271
The exact knowledge of the topographic anatomy of the urethra as well as the macro- and microcirculation of the penis [6] are the basics of reconstructive urethral surgery.	1.2160608500246486
Adherence to the fundamentals and principles of tissue transfer [5] are necessary to fascilitate conditions for successful treatment of the various disorders of the male urethra.	1.0835429766150622
Mutural description of the anatomy of the male urethra in conjunction with external male genitals is necessary because of developmental similarities as well as the close anatomical relationship.	1.026035566517026
The arterial and venous blood supply of the urethra and the penis have to be taken into account if vascularized flaps from the penile skin or the prepuce are used in urethral reconstruction.	1.0107915232379274
The dual arterial and venous vascularity of the genital skin is of fundamental importance to a successful outcome of the operative treatment.	1.1219869449359405
The purpose of this article is, to summarize the relevant anatomical knowledge of reconstructive urethral surgery.	1.0765809089916807
In this study the course of osteochondritis dissecans at two often affected areas, the femoral condyles of the knee joint and the talus at the upper ankle joint, is evaluated by studying and comparing the medium-term outcome in 40 patients treated conservatively and 72 patients treated surgically by arthroscopy.	1.2290336449248709
The criterion of assessment was magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which shows a close correlation to the arthroscopic stages of osteochondritis.	0.9642843499150516
The stages on MRI follow the morphology of the interface, i.e., the zone between the osteochondral fragment and the parent bone, on T1- and T2-weighted images.	0.9798867246242626
After 18 and 24 months there were no substantial differences visible on MRI between the two different treatment groups.	1.0600521624066557
In fact, in the majority of cases  (> 60%) the MRI result was the same in spite of the treatment that had been carried out.	1.49624413714851
Arthroscopic treatment compared to conservative treatment resulted in a small percentage in a reintegration in the sense of upgrading on the MRI (36% to 30%); nevertheless, a disintegration could not be avoided in all cases (4%).	1.226329488586035
In both treatment groups the age of the patient seems to play an important role in the course of osteochondritis, juvenile forms following a milder course than adult forms.	1.0018073259096787
The number of women with congenital cardiac disease, who mature into adulthood is increasing.	0.9789308531250114
Unfortunately, there are no prospective data published about the relative risk of different forms of contraception for these patients.	1.0659072906329112
Most women with congenital cardiac disease can safely use oral contracetives, especially low-estrogen combination or progestin-only preparations, with the exception of those, who are at particular risk because of thrombembolic complications (especially in cyanosis, pulmonary hypertension, Eisenmenger reaction, rhythm disturbances), fluid retention (especially in reduced ventricular function and congestive heart failure), arterial hypertension (important in coarctation), infectious complications (endocarditis) or hyperlipidemia.	1.1748205089655657
Oral contraceptives should be avoided in patients at increased risk for thrombembolic events.	1.1317553486364742
Intrauterine devices are very effective, have no metabolic side effects and merely cary a small risk of endocarditis.	1.0604809700599962
Newer devices containing progesterone only may put the patients at a still smaller risk.	0.8553163156415222
Contraceptive subdermal implants (e.g.	0.2914333649973799
levonorgestrel) are used with good results in the United States for patients with contraindications to estrogen-containing oral contraceptives and may well become more widely accepted in patients in Germany in the coming years.	1.1137883714295167
Barrier methods can be used, but have a higher failure rate, which may be inacceptable in patients at risk (e.g.	1.0817143301838341
Especially in Eisenmenger's, permanent sterilisation should be advised.	0.6289881609270268
Two groups of 15 patients each with disseminated intravascular coagulation in association with septic disease were treated with low-molecular-weight heparin  (lmw-heparin) in different dosages (group I: 1,5-5 IE/kg body weight (BW) per hour; group II: 8-15 IE/kg BW).	1.1549409106252604
We studied the levels of D-dimer, thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT), prothrombin fragments 1 and 2 (PTF), and global tests of coagulation like prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT), thrombin time (TT) and platelet count, plasminogen activation (PA) and fibrinogen concentration to estimate the success of heparin therapy in the two groups.	1.1311295925051676
TT and fibrinogen concentration were not suitable to follow the course of the coagulation disorder.	1.0864111809182313
PT, PTT, platelet count progressively PA, D-dimer, TAT, and PTF normalised progressively after heparinisation.	0.8945529347133143
However, only the last three parameters were sensitive enough to show different effects of variable dosages of lmw-heparin.	1.1128202862444134
D-dimer, TAT, and PTF levels declined in proportion with heparin concentrations, and thus appear to be the most useful parameters for monitoring the therapeutic effect of heparin in septic coagulopathies.	1.1210440393959151
In patients with acute or chronic myocarditis, arrhythmias are a common and often the only clinical symptom in the natural course of the disease.	1.0344245540251553
The potentially malignant tachy- and bradyarrhythmias are of particular significance in the differential diagnosis of sudden cardiac death in myocarditis.	0.9888407075636146
Factors responsible for the increased incidence of cardiac arrhythmias are structural changes, parameters of ventricular dynamics and vascular changes.	0.9615565211502068
On the one hand, inflammatory processes in the cardiac myocytes and interstitium can lead directly to fluctuations in membrane potential.	0.9830843020328303
Fibrosis and scarring of the myocardial tissue and secondary hypertrophy and atrophy of the myocytes favor the development of ectopic pacemakers, late potentials and reentry as a result of inhomogeneous stimulus conduction.	0.9979784534271285
Furthermore, parameters of ventricular dynamics such as increased wall tension, increased myocardial oxygen consumption and diminished coronary reserve in the case of disturbed systolic or diastolic left ventricular function also contribute to the increased incidence of arrhythmias.	1.1700343377311606
Lastly, vascular factors can further increase the arrhythmogenicity of the inflamed myocardium through the disturbance of micro- and macrovascular perfusion and the resulting myocardial ischemia.	1.0846347557956548
Non-invasive rhythmological evaluation by 24 h Holter ECG, measurement of ventricular late potentials and heart rate variability can be used for orienting risk stratification of the at-risk patient with myocarditis.	1.0873703486550155
Programmed atrial and ventricular electrophysiological stimulation also has a relatively high predictive value for spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias.	0.9250021620897516
It should be emphasized that, at the present time, optimal electrophysiological parameters with a high predictive value do not exist.	0.9254878822427041
In a selected patient population, immunosuppressive therapy in addition to conventional antiarrhythmic therapy can lead to the reduction or complete suppression of spontaneous and inducible arrhythmias.	1.0495313079494357
Nevertheless, in the interim, further precautionary antiarrhythmic measures such as serial antiarrhythmic treatment, VT ablation and AICD implantation are necessary in patients with malignant cardiac arrhythmias.	1.1386974728525554
Right ventricular myocardial biopsy for demonstration or exclusion of myocarditis is an important additional examination which can improve the differential diagnosis and treatment of patients with cardiac arrhythmias of unclear etiology.	1.0576072665815814
Aim: To investigate the distribution of collagens in experimental microvascular surgery.	1.0418016060286484
Material and methods: Autografts (4 mm) of the left common carotid artery in 20 Wistar rats were harvested up to 4 weeks after surgery.	1.35129373766707
The specimens were investigated immunohistochemically for the demonstration and distribution of collagen III and IV.	0.8866619510682183
Results: The demonstration and distribution pattern of collagens was a function of the accuracy of each single suture.	1.0913833699039928
In the intima, the organisation and amount of collagen IV was directed to the lumen and dependent on the distance and vitality of the vessel segments.	1.0272509739559357
The media had in its axis direction the lowest reparative potential for regenerating the continuity break.	0.786770273733055
The adventitia formed a thick cuff around the anastomosis, in which collagen III and IV-positive vasa vasorum had grown in a circular fashion.	0.9964935878992159
The marked myointimal hyperplasia in the area around the anastomosis and in the entire autograft was made up of collagen-positive extracellular matrix.	1.0639288629964685
Conclusions: Our results support the demand for a careful and atraumatic suture technique in microvascular surgery.	1.168503804419678
The identification of collagens in rat vessels is a valuable tool for studying wound healing in experimental microsurgery.	0.8621100573094714
We treated 8123 patients with invasive malignant melanoma were treated up to 1995.	0.8152722807261031
2200 had invasive melanomas with less than 0.75 mm Breslow thickness; of these, 45 developed metastases.	1.141867212788392
Three had second primary tumors with greater thickness.	0.7504765001971873
One case showed metastasis from another tumor.	0.7407841001277397
In two cases the metastases were not ascertained histologically.	1.0319117554294088
The remaining 39 cases showed some peculiarities: a greater proportion of late and of internal (as contrasted to regional) metastases.	1.0798317930624237
Most of these primary tumors had a Breslow thickness of more than 0.5 mm and were Clark level III or even IV.	1.0968547027917388
Male patients and primary tumor sites in the area of head and neck were significantly over-represented.	1.012662229704451
In this paper the question is considered to what extent the patient's and analyst's perception and tolerance of both aggressive and destructive elements of the analytic relationship can be increased.	1.2007071932976283
Successful interpretation enables the patient to feel, enact and comprehend animosity in the transference and experience that the relationship can continue.	0.957884255627318
The concept of primary aggression developed in Freud's speculation on death instinct is discussed in its clinical function of relief.	0.9397002778357012
The metapsychological concept of primary aggression facilitates work on aggressive and especially destructive developments of the relationship.	0.9005694423254909
Freud's and subsequently Eissler's examination of the reciprocity of destructiveness and narcissism opened plausible clinical avenues to explain the compensation of defence mechanisms against mankind's vulnerability in the face of mortality.	0.8256011567228152
The concept of primary aggression is obviously of greater relevance than frustration/aggression models since the former does not view the patient as mere victim of his biography, but as a subject with the potential to enact his own destructiveness.	1.007154944156389
Since aggressiveness is often concomitant with fear and suppressed guilt, interpretation plays a decisive role in relieving the superego strain; more confrontation may involve the analyst in the role of the persecutor.	0.9299447249076469
Sudden and violent feelings of hate towards the analyst require careful treatment of the patient's irritation.	1.0378154743696117
Interpretation of genetic causes of animosity often prove to be countertransference resistance; interpretation in transference, however, is viewed as profitable.	0.9365574538553609
Finally, those dangerous and destructive phases of treatments are discussed, which compel the analyst to protect the setting.	1.1475238153845662
Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common viral agent of severe lower respiratory tract disease in infants and children throughout the world.	1.2014239799328852
Highest hospitalization rates are seen in the second and third month of life.	1.1223563440052622
Young infants, especially those with predisposing conditions such as prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), chronic lung disease (CLD), congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis or immunodeficiency, are the pediatric patients at increased risk for severe RSV disease.	1.1691475565749438
Specific therapeutic options for RSV are limited.	0.7144043132302933
In this prospective study we investigated the efficacy of microcatheter spinal anaesthesia in comparison with a combined spinal-epidural technique in trauma patients.	1.086136579432302
Background: In Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain and Italy, the OPHTEL project combines clinical centers of ophthalmology and internal medicine, an institute for medical informatics and health services research, a publishing company and different industrial partners in the EDP market.	1.0389884111142869
Purpose: A prospective study was initiated for the correlation of the findings in the initial cranial CT with the long-term follow-up MRI in children with severe head injury.	1.2901641983019196
Another aim was the evaluation of frequency and location of lesions, found only in MRI.	0.9441164483560001
A differentiation is made between patient information on findings and diagnosis, patient information on avoidance of known dangers, and patient information on the risks involved in a particular intervention that has been selected.	1.086766875185371
If no information is given on the risks inherent in a patient's condition and how she must proceed in order to ensure that they do not come about, this is considered to be a treatment error, and in these circumstances the intervention is then legally seen as bodily harm.	1.3064610178612979
Information on the risks involved in an intervention must be given in good time, which generally means on the day before the operation.	1.033179443746372
An exception is made to this rule for day surgery.	0.7929575190419448
The patient must be informed about treatment alternatives when the method selected is not the method of choice or when there is an alternative offering equivalent chances but risks of a different kind.	1.1549520502421402
Such information is given to the adult patient who is capable of legal transactions.	1.0147480569072589
In the case of minors or of patients who are not capable of legal transactions their legal representative is responsible for receiving the information [and making decisions].	0.9968502094626208
In the case of unconscious patients everything depends on "presumable consent to the operation".	0.9216057973756633
If a patient later cites lacks in the information supplied to her to support a claim for compensation in a situation where it would be unwise to refuse an operation, she must elaborate plausible grounds for being in conflict over the decision even following appropriate information.	0.9462233144798564
Within the last few years the use of Point-of-Care Analyzers increased.	1.0859165701935043
These testing is primarily performed in the emergency room, intensive care units, and in the operating room using small portable analyzers.	1.2002192098047897
The fact of being transportable and working with rechargeable or changable batteries and disposable cartridges caused us to use blood gas analysis in the prehospital setting.	0.8067768577676658
Patients undergoing major vascular surgery frequently require a substantial intraoperative fluid replacement to assure hemodynamic stability, which is in excess of the expected fluid requirements due to starving, blood and insensible losses.	1.0555618882493274
This leads to a positive fluid balance which can not be readily explained.	0.8893592304913162
The case of a 57 year old patient is reported, who suffered from an acute myocardial infarction with maximum CK and CKMB values of 821 and 84 U/l, respectively.	1.0636952929536458
The patient underwent bicycle exercise testing 9 days after a myocardial infarction in 25 W steps every 2 min starting with 50 W. The ergometry was interrupted at 125 W because of ST segment depression of 0.28 mV in V6.	1.0057766142758742
Systolic blood pressure dropped to 55 mm Hg, combined with severe angina and shock.	0.9497179864032345
Volume substitution and catecholamines did not elevate blood pressure.	0.697293979110482
Immediate M-mode and Doppler echo revealed a "stiletto"-shaped mitral regurgitation profile typical of acute mitral valve insufficiency.	1.0111821159183074
The transesophageal echocardiogram showed a distinct mass moving between the left ventricle and left atrium, diagnostic of papillary muscle rupture.	1.019956317262439
Despite of shock, mitral valve replacement was performed successfully.	0.768432109460634
To our knowledge, this is the first report of a papillary muscle rupture during exercise testing after myocardial infarction.	0.8115635110933653
The flow directed balloon-tipped pulmonary artery catheter introduced by Swann and Ganz 1970 has made possible the measurement of filling pressures in the heart and is extensively used in operating rooms, in catheterization laboratories and in intensive care units.	0.9713857244828138
The rupture of the pulmonary artery is an uncommon complication associated with a high mortality rate exceeding 50 percent.	1.0729169486725763
Main symptoms are cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea and cardiac shock.	0.8178525618798275
Complications occur if guidelines for the safe use of the balloon-tipped catheters are not strictly followed: Excessive catheter manipulation, advancing the catheter tip too far peripherally and leaving the inflated balloon in the wedge position for long periods should be avoided.	0.9679291331073809
Patients with pulmonary hypertension as well as elderly and anticoagulated patients are at greater risk.	0.9777540597582047
On 90 patients with 93 unstable fractures of the thoracic spine and the thoracolumbar junction we treated by a minimal invasive procedure between may 1996 and april 1998, in 46 patients an endoscopic splitting of the diaphragm was performed.	1.1149514141598513
The diaphragma was dissected at its attachment at the spine and the adjoining costal base.	0.7933022611766776
After partial corporectomy and discectomy, a tricortical bone graft has been inserted.	0.8910803072111386
An additional stabilization was done by using a plate and screw system.	0.9912964395523678
The incision of the diaphragm was closed by suturing or using an universal endostapler.	0.8947919262565113
Controlling the postoperative results a complete closure of the incision was documented by X-ray and CT-scan.	1.0401619421287167
There was no conversion to the open procedure or postoperative infection.	1.004567485261749
Splitting the diaphragma opens also the thoracolumbar junction to a minimal invasive treatment and stabilization of fractures.	0.9123668868478875
This is a report of an interdisciplinary approach to diagnosis and treatment of stroke, combining a stroke unit and rehabilitation in one clinic.	1.0679413176304822
This series contains unselected patients from a narrow surrounding.	0.7367764040090169
Mean age of 559 patients was 68.7 years (median 70 years).	1.1049233451279168
25% of patients had an initial Barthel index of <30, 20% presented with TIA's and PRIND's.	1.2557890856867349
9% suffered from cerebral hemorrhage.	0.9536366454346847
The unbroken chain of care allowed a relative short length of stay in the acute care (9.4 days) without prolonging the rehabilitation phase.	1.1576650270368762
The one month mortality was 6.7%, one year mortality 18.3%.	1.2453012315290348
Discharge to a nursing home was necessary in 5.4%.	0.916965809320495
Overall more than 90% of our patients have been treated continuously in our clinic.	1.1311699912826447
Combining modern diagnostics with early onset rehabilitation seem advantageous.	0.7452590640508376
About 220 knee endoprostheses are implanted at our clinic annually.	0.7500955472917237
This is a routine procedure for the instrument staff.	1.1173797877905725
Practice has shown, however, that deficient operating room management as regards the instruments, implants, operating room staff, and surgical planning causes problems.	1.1729466800240766
As a result of this, a prophylactic search for sources of error began (risk management).	1.0101003351369022
If the sources of error are found, described, and remedied, knee endoprosthetic surgery will be successful for both the patient and the surgical team.	1.1591558657071475
Cooperation and communication among manufacturer, surgeon, and surgical nursing staff should serve to minimize forensic risks.	1.0703779728632568
The obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia pneumoniae has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis since viable pathogen has been recovered from plaques.	0.7642488077039539
Chlamydiae are epithelial pathogens notorious for causing persistent infection.	0.6004375031037835
Atherosclerosis, however, is a chronic inflammatory disease involving mesenchymal cells of the vascular wall.	1.2293402472105768
A bacterial contribution to atherosclerosis appears more relevant if the resident mesenchymal cells of the vascular wall that constitute the plaque can support chlamydial infection continuously.	0.8502945240878685
The study consists of a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.	1.235847079755382
Besides medical and sociodemographic data, two personality factors - self-efficacy and locus of control - were found to predict postoperative pain.	1.3370816345020748
Self-efficacy describes the expectations of a person to successfully execute the behavior required to produce behavioral outcomes.	0.907482792494935
Locus of control, in the extreme case, is a personality factor which is represented by an internal orientation in which the individual believes that rewards are brought about by his own action, versus an external orientation, in which the individual believes that rewards are the result of powerful others or chance factors and fate.	1.0647143780315287
We postulate that the two personality factors correlate with postoperative parameters of pain and that there are also multiple correlations between them.	1.101825536622773
At present there is neither an completely inert biomaterial available, nor does a universal test exist which objectively evaluates biocompatibility.	0.8784790472471861
One reason is the individuality of the host, especially with regard to the inflammatory response.	1.239455455906855
Inflammation was found to induce biodegradation by hydrolysis or auto-oxidation of vascular prosthetic matrix after implantation.	0.8594383890885658
The present study was performed to investigate the specific humoral immune response after implantation of segments of a collagen-impregnated polyester prosthesis (Dacron) in Balb/c mice on experimental days 1, 18, 38, and 322.	1.1960611843693254
Serum antibody detection was performed by modified enzyme immunoassay using the prosthesis as a target.	0.9827502383426465
Specific polymer antibodies, enhanced by repeated implantations, could be detected in all mice which received grafts up to experimental day 322.	0.9703745781079489
These antibodies were not directed against the collagen coating.	0.8008899543911067
The antibody formation could be further enhanced by a combined administration of complete Freund's adjuvant together with the first implantation at experimental day 1.	0.9284763346977
Results suggest that specific polymer antibodies, reflecting an inflammatory response, might be an additional parameter for biocompatibility testing of vascular prostheses.	0.8643276636882921
Twenty-nine unicondylar fractures of the distal femur were treated at the Trauma Center "Bergmannsheil", University of Bochum, Germany, between 1981 and 1994.	1.2519261519666751
All patients sustained their injuries from severe direct trauma.	0.7025341283501001
There were 16 lateral condylar fractures, 7 medial condylar fractures and 6 tangential posterior ("Hoffa-type") fractures.	1.2166705914718556
Twenty-eight closed injuries and 1 grade IIIB open fracture were included.	0.8661540015950396
Eleven patients sustained concomitant injuries to the skeleton.	0.7067174630166866
All fractures were treated with open reduction and internal fixation with screws within 8 h of admission.	0.8254650640943545
Postoperative management consisted of early continuous passive motion and minimal weight-bearing for 6-8 weeks, progressing to full weight-bearing.	0.8631892997750421
The mean follow-up was 68 months (18-120).	1.1095616349096202
The therapeutic outcome (clinical result, radiographs) was rated by the Neer score.	1.1567924909950817
Twenty-seven patients were available for follow-up examination.	1.0856466640255018
Of these, 23 were rated as excellent.	0.9497050923286207
3 achieved satisfactory results, and 1 had an unsatisfactory result.	1.144316237467721
All patients who did not achieve an excellent outcome had had accompanying injuries.	0.9900224255860749
Open reduction and internal screw fixation of unicondylar femur fractures provided overall excellent long-term results.	0.8668258021626327
The therapeutic outcome was significantly affected by associated injuries of the skeleton.	0.9983431778712677
The realization that a disease will not respond to a curative treatment causes massive fear and anxiety in affected patients, but also feelings of helplessness and insecurity in health professionals caring for the patients.	1.0823036233556038
The global fears of affected patients can be divided into three main categories of problems; stepwise mastering of these problems may help to maintain or restore an acceptably high quality of life according to the WHO guidelines for palliative medicine.	1.023495226835768
In light of the anxiety felt by physicians and others caring for this patient group, palliative psycho-oncology must offer patient-centered holistic care in which the psycho-oncologist is not an isolated therapist but rather a member of a team made up of physicians, nurses, religious workers, psychologists, ergotherpists, physiotherapists, social workers, and especially family members.	0.9675855760093344
Together, this group of health professionals and family members caring for the affected patient form a group that itself receives care as needed.	0.9886278001235694
Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) with hepatic vein occlusion is a rare disorder that can effectively be treated in advanced stages with orthotopic liver transplantation.	1.1422647500546002
We report on 16 patients who received 18 liver grafts and were followed up for at least 2 years.	1.1820771361926166
In 7 patients a hematological disorder was confirmed by bone marrow biopsy.	0.9844835181450986
One patient died after 4 months due to cytomegalovirus pneumonia; another patient died after 2 years due to progressive liver failure after portal vein thrombosis.	1.0687711181311152
The actuarial 5-year survival rate is 87.5 % compared to 85.3 % in all other 710 orthotopic liver transplantations performed from September 1988 to December 1995 at our institution.	1.209315332115164
Anticoagulation consisted of intravenous heparin and overlapping continuation with dicoumarin.	0.7055391036450777
Three patients received hydroxyurea for thrombocytosis, one patient for 1 week only early after the transplantation.	1.0665535094683016
Two postoperative abdominal hemorrhages required laparotomy.	0.545325525265362
Two patients had to be retransplanted, one for thrombosis of the hepatic artery and portal vein after discontinuation of dicoumarin due to GI bleeding and one for hepatic vein thrombosis after insufficient dicoumarin intake.	1.0398499408965702
Terminal BCS represents a good indication for orthotopic liver transplantation; however, life-long, closely monitored anticoagulation is essential.	1.007029293241572
Postmenopausal estrogen-replacement therapy maintains bone density as assessed by densitometry of skeletal sites relevant for future fracture.	0.8289747175047832
Optimal doses are 2 mg oral estradiol, 0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogens, 1.25 mg estrone and 50 µg transdermal estradiol.	1.0324679885425803
There is a role for calcium supplementation in individuals with non-optimal dietary intake of calcium.	0.9179874546128699
Observational studies suggest that estrogen replacement reduces the future risk for hip fracture by 25 %.	0.9038675228815525
Discontinuation of replacements is associated with an increase of fracture risk few years later.	0.9365458408678402
It is noteworthy that there is a lack of formal fracture studies providing data on the efficacy of estrogen replacement for primary prevention of osteoporosis and for secondary prevention in terms of treatment of women with established osteoporosis, with a diagnosis based on WHO criteria.	1.0782945012426508
Raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, and tibolone, a synthetic steroid with weak estrogenic, progestogenic and androgenic properties, may constitute alternatives to estrogen-replacement therapy.	1.0753447379488184
Raloxifenen maintains bone density in and reduces vetebral fractures by some 50 % in women with prevalent osteoporosis.	1.1224038234771594
Artificial insemination from donor (heterologous insemination) is a rationally based treatment in complete male infertility.	0.9694378701235609
In this overview the enlarged knowledge on semen donors, the receiving couples and the development of the offspring will be summarized.	0.9886098498871047
Although motivation of men towards semen donation is predominantly based on financial expectancy, most of the donors agree to offer the offspring not-identifiable information on biological and social characteristics.	0.920890685231851
Semen donation does not enhance the risk of consanguinity and of genetic diseases in the population.	0.8999552106522789
The decision to undergo heterologous insemination is a burden for the couples.	0.8747691419097016
Retrospectively, however, the majority state positive influences of the insemination on their partnership.	1.0986685499230244
The most important question is whether they should disclose the insemination to the children.	0.9727183068628851
The course of the pregnancy and the postnatal development of the children do not differ from those of children of natural procreation.	1.1610160277320154
They receive more love and care than "usual" children.	0.7173539888517043
Their rights concerning the insemination, however, are poorly considered.	1.056823667323386
If we agree that the knowledge of genetic descent is part of human rights, non-disclosure of the donor insemination to the children raises severe ethical problems.	0.9509003335250128
The extended field of view imaging procedure named "SieScape" provides, for the first time, a mode of establishing in real time a sonographic picture up to 60 cm in length.	0.9989067363324494
This allows the display of large organs or tumors as well as large areas of the body in a single view, without having to assemble several pictures.	1.1207742465830797
Furthermore, pathological find-ings can be shown in full size in their surroundings.	1.1163982969471111
This method makes it considerably easier to convey sonographic results to the therapist who is not present at the investigation and to control a finding, for instance a tumor, during therapy.	1.0923015982286783
Heart rate variability (HrV) has been established as an important risk parameter in patients surviving myocardial infaction.	1.0638163181455944
Recently, analysis of HRV - particularly of the standard deviation of NN intervals (SDNN) - from short term ECG recordings has been proposed as an alternative to that from 24 hour Holter monitorings.	1.1956692977286512
The present study is the first to compare SDNN from short term recordings to that from 24 hour recordings with respect to risk stratification after myocardial infarction.	1.114097560233872
In 60 patients at the time of discharge from the hospital, SDNN from Holter monitoring averaged 93  +/-  30 ms compared to 39  +/-  18 determined from short term recordings.	1.071882856443275
Patients with a prospectively defined clinical endpoint differed significantly from those with an uneventful course with respect to age, left ventricular ejection fraction, mean RR interval from Holter recording ( 753  +/-  153 vs 921  +/-  132 ms), mean RR from short term recording (783  +/-  153 vs 914  +/-  163 ms), and SDNN from the Holter recording (71  +/-  27 vs 97  +/-  29 ms; p < 0.001) However, patients with and without clinical event could not be seperated by means of SDNN measured from short term ECG registrations (35  +/-  22 vs 41  +/-  19 ms; P = NS).	1.1591173689193173
Thus, SDNN measured from short term ECG recordings does not seem to be useful regarding risk stratification of patients after myocardial infarction.	1.0296270330064956
Analysis of HRV should be performed using 24 hour Holter monitoring, which provides more information and reflects circadian fluctuation in autonomic tone.	1.0772217008185905
Glomus tumors (glomangiomata) are benign tumors arising from glomus cells.	0.9303738073189112
Multiple glomangiomata are less frequent and less painful than the solitary variant, which is usually located subungually.	1.1264291316503852
Nonetheless multiple glomangiomata - sometimes being sensitive to pressure and changes in temperature - may cause considerable discomfort.	1.1675927347427044
Treatment of multiple glomangiomata is problematic because of the often large number of tumors.	1.0085016543299146
Sclerotherapy represents an alternative to surgical and cryosurgical therapy.	0.8691324284326811
We report on sclerotherapy in a 35 year old female patient with multiple hereditary glomus tumors.	1.2072352790694483
Conventional echocardiographic methods of measuring left ventricular mass (LVM) are limited by assumptions of ventricular geometry and image plane positioning.	1.0230166198953723
Three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography offers a promising new approach for more accurate determination of LVM.	0.8582736424266292
This study was performed to compare LVM measurement by one- (1D), two- (2D), and 3D echocardiography with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients (pts) with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).	1.3849792739540374
Determination of Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) can be performed through washout methods, indicator gas dilution or bodyplethysmography.	0.8982875023836049
Some of these techniques have been adapted for use in intensive care patients whilst being mechanically ventilated.	1.2095398813853497
However, most measurement setups are bulky, cumbersome to use and their running costs are high.	1.1420785679208225
Hence FRC measurement has not become a routine method in intensive care although it offers considerable advantages in the management of ventilated  patients such as the determination of "best PEEP", the detection of progressive alveolar collapse in the course of acute lung injury and during weaning from mechanical ventilation.	1.070287548317558
Up to now most efforts to improve and simplify FRC measurement were made at the expense of accuracy.	0.9011483205821392
An ideal method ought to be accurate, easy to handle and cost-effective.	0.8847251789218853
It should supply not only FRC data but also information about intrapulmonary gas distribution and dead space.	0.804215473948299
These demands can be met using modern data acquisition software.	0.7643536321555828
The pros and cons of all methods available for FRC measurement are discussed in view of their suitability for intensive care patients.	1.0689076668930197
A conventional nitrogen washout using emission spectroscopy for measurement of nitrogen concentration gives satisfying exact values for the determination  of the parameters mentioned above.	1.0686557955103724
The measurement error can be lowered under 5% by special corrections for flow and  nitrogen signal (delay and rise times, changes of gas viscosity).	1.0803432607204402
For flow measurement a normal pneumotachograph can be used.	0.9123695274338456
Using a laptop computer for data  acquisition the bed-side monitor fulfills most of the demands in intensive care.	0.8640845658685202
It is then also possible to measure indices of intrapulmonary gas distribution such as Alveolar Mixing Efficiency and Lung Clearance Index.	0.8305200348089385
Three strategies are followed in handling the key issue within the field of action of care and services for the elderly: securing the material needs of those requiring care, creating appropriate care structures, and providing an effective counselling back-up to alleviate interface problems.	1.0809831816473336
Thouse latter, process-oriented aids, have been the subject of discussion and further development under the key term of case management for a good decade.	1.168778746076536
The aim in this context is to prevent the elderly from being unnecessarily moved into residential care, to stop the revolving door syndrome, to ensure that older people can stay in their homes, to support family members acting as care providers, to enhance the quality of services and those to ease the strain on fund providers.	1.158813578279934
In the context of case managment, these diverse tasks are performed by three basic substantive functions: the gatekeeper, broker, and advocacy functions.	1.0927664207579886
Each of these three functions characterizes the main variants of case management with a different weighting (care management, community care, managed care and case management as a counselling approach with a particular focus on individual help).	1.0525005881796918
Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a bullous autoimmune disease of the elderly; it is characterized by tense bullae on both erythematous and otherwise apparently normal skin.	1.0580707626896697
Several clinical variants of BP have been described, and we now add our observations of two BP cases mimicking subacute prurigo.	0.9600913053896885
Both patients had suffered from intensely pruritic excoriated papules for several months before presentation.	0.8018109365580117
Blisters had never developed and did not occur during follow up.	0.9342746394874509
Histology showed changes of chronic dermatitis.	0.6884032527050982
In the serum of both patients, indirect immunofluorescence on NaCl-separated human skin revealed the presence of circulating antibodies binding to the roof of the artificial blisters.	0.9634528364425842
Perilesional skin biopsies showed linear IgG or C3 deposits in the basement membran zone.	0.7949732326155149
Immunoblotting of epidermal and dermal extracts demonstrated the binding of the antibodies to an epidermal 230-kD protein, which is the known major bullous pemphigoid antigen.	1.0149209100274634
These cases are described as a basis for discussion of the clinical spectrum of bullous pemphigoid.	1.0213327467150037
The distal metatarsal osteotomy according to Magerl allows correction of a hallux valgus deformity by lateral and plantar displacement as well as by pronation and varisation.	0.9320377587922557
The length of the first metatarsal can be adjusted by the depth of the cut at the resection or by a slightly oblique osteotomy.	1.034124623796862
If necessary, soft tissue release and/or a osteotomy of the first proximal phalanx can be done to relocate the sesamoids under the head of the first metatarsal.	1.100384073946267
A review of 118 foot operations in 75 patients demonstrated a very good or good result in about 75 %.	0.9866845868938493
Radiological examination showed sufficient lateralisation of the metatarsal head.	0.7065089198666457
Evaluating the length of the first metatarsal and the amount of variation, the results were less satisfying.	1.3218516710907608
The metatarsophalangeal angles could be corrected by 14  ° and the intermetatarsal angles by 7  ° on average.	0.9381651932515273
The sophisticated operative procedure limits the use of this technique as a standard procedure.	1.171304279173685
The contribution of Rudolf Virchow to dermatology seems to have been forgotten, or present-day dermatologists are not aware of it.	1.0029889831941425
The present historical review is intended to show that Virchow's thoughts and the terminology created by him are still alive.	0.8357846540397684
The report encompasses a short biography, including Virchow's nonmedical activities.	0.9047468129701784
It starts with early experimental publications, which laid to the foundation for his fame, and with dermatological studies of his early period.	1.1366682405119926
This is followed by a detailed description of his contributions pertaining to dermatology in his largest work, "Cellularpathologie".	0.9741555369314254
Special mention is made of Virchow's lasting contributions to medical, and particularly dermatological, terminology.	0.9655413364857732
Finally, his historical studies, his latter small publications on topics in dermatology, his pupils and scientific friends, and the social-political and anthropological activities of later years are discussed.	1.1908436204277018
Thus, a multifaceted picture is painted of a still modern pathologist who has influenced dermatology in multiple ways.	1.0094060260986704
Starter's pistols are often bought for self-defense, but can also be used for criminal activities (e.g.	0.9113154195780068
assaults, etc.).	0.42461011813243815
When a starter's pistol is loaded with blank cartridges and is fired, a powerful shooting noise results.	0.8556172952141213
The level of the noise produced is high enough to cause acoustic trauma.	0.8586883832918328
For legal examinations and giving an expert opinion further information is needed about the power of such noise.	0.9193492772457821
We examined how high peak sound pressure levels were of the gunshots of blank cartridges and whether there existed any directional characteristics from the noise emissions.	0.856085658513082
In all, 15 different models of starter's pistols of 8 different calibres were examined.	0.8804859458441676
In addition to blank cartridges, 8 mm tear gas cartridges were also examined.	1.0680105945281373
Four transducers were situated in the horizontal plane around the muzzle: 0 ° (shooting direction), 45 °, 90 °, and 180 ° (towards the firer).	1.2178440187259965
The distances between the transducers and the muzzle were 25 cm, 50 cm, 100 cm, and 200 cm.	1.0582760557972066
At a distance of 1 m and in the 0 ° shooting direction the peak sound pressure levels of nearly all weapons tested exceeded 160 dB.	0.9321533443274497
At a shooting distance of 25 cm the peak sound pressure levels reached 181 dB.	0.7658044926539975
In addition, we observed a directional characteristic concerning the emission of noise: pistols produced higher peak sound pressure levels to the front than backwards towards the firer.	1.0478540071566462
Owing to their rare incidence, foreign body injuries in the region of the orbit, skull base and skull have up to now mostly been treated in  the literature by means of case reports.	1.1093927349571888
Here we present our experience and treatment regimen for ten patients we have treated during the last 3 years.	1.124840760783347
In seven cases the foreign body was located in the orbit alone, whereas in three others the orbit and the frontal base were equally involved.	1.054116105599776
Except for one case, the foreign material could be removed completely.	1.020313700197954
Three patients suffered from partial or complete loss of vision and one patient developed a psychosyndrome during the follow-up period, but no late effects were registered in the remaining six cases.	1.194847544934073
Before removing the foreign body and carefully reconstructing the accident, however, we strongly recommend the documentation of possible functional deficits, preferably by means of photography.	1.058890047569191
CT is the method of choice for localising the foreign body, except for the depiction of wood particles.	0.9505488865648747
Here, sonography and MR should be performed.	0.9042350681622386
As the therapeutic approach, the cooperation of an interdisciplinary team of ophthalmogists, neuro- and maxillofacial surgeons seems mandatory.	1.0816094939882166
To avoid inflammation, the immediate removal of the foreign material is recommended in cases with considerable intracranial lesions: post-operative neurologic and intensive care monitoring should be provided.	1.131838812919165
Treatment is completed by high-dose antibiotics, using CSF-soluble substances and, if necessary, anti-convulsives.	1.0217189007292116
Rocuronium is a new nondepolarizing muscle relaxant for which a fast onset has been described.	1.0610249045056614
The goal of this study was to examine whether the characteristics of rocuronium could make it an appropriate relaxant for the anaesthetic management of operations of intermediate duration such as endoscopic upper airway surgery.	0.9704121617011493
These operations, which require the anaesthesiologist and surgeon to "share" the patient's airway, require good muscle relaxation for endotracheal intubation and placement of endoscopic instruments.	1.1361057380601598
In addition, the time course of neuromuscular blockade and its relation to the quality of intubating conditions were analysed.	1.0357825442208934
Patients and methods: In order to better define the potential advantages and risks of laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), we designed a prospective study including 73 eyes.	1.1512248547066977
Treatment of tachycardic atrial fibrillation (AF) is difficult in patients with congestive heart failure because many drugs which exert negative dromotropic effects (beta-blockers, calcium channel antagonists) may depress ventricular contractility and/or decrease arterial blood pressure.	0.9660948517903537
We have identified 2 intravascular sites in the superior (SVC) and inferior vena cava (IVC) where parasympathetic nerves, which innervate the atrioventricular node, can be stimulated electrically.	1.083289755434936
In 8 dogs, a 7-F catheter with an expandable electrode basket at its tip was non-fluoroscopically positioned in the SVC and in the proximal IVC (time for positioning: 3-5 minutes).	1.1543044554320638
High-frequency electrical parasympathetic stimulation (PS) with 20 Hz at an impulse duration of 0.1 ms was performed during pacing induced AF.	1.0996766656882617
Results: With increasing stimulus strength, a graded ventricular rate slowing was observed during PS in the SVC and IVC (P<0.01, ANOVA).	1.0895594144669931
The negative dromotropic effect started instantaneously after onset of PS and ceased immediately after termination of PS.	0.8249096312722091
During ventricular pacing at a constant rate, no decrease of the arterial blood pressure was observed during PS.	1.248231361655575
PS in the IVC yielded significantly lower stimulation thresholds than in the SVC.	0.9707685719912292
Conclusions: Transvenous parasympathetic stimulation for ventricular rate control during AF can easily be achieved in the SVC and IVC in dogs.	1.0384646304682696
This procedure may provide a foundation for investigating the usefulness of PS in humans.	0.8200517662109483
If the results translate to patients, PS may be very beneficial in the treatment of AF in patients with congestive heart failure.	0.9263402172745796
A total of 86 patients suffering from fractures of the thoracolumbar spine were followed up after an average time period of 57 months (12-98).	1.1627905023988474
Of these patients, 56 were treated operatively and 30 conservatively.	1.0498626074037387
According to the AO/ASIF classification, 66% of the operated group were fractures of type A, 29% of type B, and 5% of type C. All patients were operated on by means of dorsal locking instrumentation with pedicular fixation and, apart from six patients, with transpedicular cancellous bone grafting.	1.3884873290878303
The conservative group was treated according to the guidelines of Böhler with closed reduction, plaster cast, and rehabilitation program.	1.0401449534204261
All fractures in the conservative group were of type A.	1.0863215743335077
Charcot foot in its original sense is equivalent to stage 4 of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN) which is known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease since 1886.	1.0317129217535612
This entity, which can be subdivided into 3 groups including subgroups, predominantly begins during childhood and progresses slowly.	0.9031591031822002
The first symptom, often unnoticed by the patient for a long period, is weakness of the intrinsic foot muscles with consecutive hammer-toe formation and mobile pes cavus.	1.2351398596409229
Progredient atrophy of the peroneal, extensor, tibialis posterior and finally triceps surae muscles leads to fixed pes cavus varus excavatus with severe varus deformity of the hindfoot, secondary varus position of the talus at the ankle level and subsequent arthrosis of the medial compartment.	1.0439535732087237
Permanent varus deformity of the ankle almost invariably leads to stress fractures of the malleoli because of repetitive microtrauma (stage 5 of HMSN).	1.0509504226177566
The alveolar adenoma of the lung is a rare benign tumor in which the normal parenchymal architectur is imitated by a proliferation of both the alveolar epithelial cells and the mesenchymal septal cells.	1.126136297993106
The first description, based on six cases, was published in 1986 by Yousem and Hochholzer.	1.0425698793839566
From their ultrastructural findings they presumed a type II pneumocytes differentiation of the epithelial cells.	0.9200913837912237
We investigated an alveolar adenoma of the lung immunhistochemical by means of antibodies against apoprotein B and C of human surfactant.	0.9356742406361391
Both the lining cells and the macrophages in the alveolar-like spaces were stained.	0.9679412737632956
The septal connection tissue cells did not react.	0.5797972180649467
These findings confirm the expression of surfactant constituants and, hence, the differentiation into type II pneumocytes of the epithelial cells of the alveolar adenoma.	1.0924791281470208
Breast cancer is the most frequent malignant tumor in women, whereas it is rare in men.	1.2724732921442437
In our own case series the ratio is 175 : 1.	0.9620671928046086
The present paper deals with an evaluation of clinical and morphological findings from a series of 54 de novo male breast cancers observed in our institution from 1978 to 1996 and a comparative discussion of 528 female breast cancers from the same geographic area.	1.0618129576239665
We should like to focus on the following observations:	0.8226194429038391
Patients with congenital varicella syndrome develop cicatricial skin lesions and microphthalmia.	0.8649220208497203
An overlap in the clinical manifestations exist with a specific genetic disorder, called MIDAS syndrome.	1.0088491145157295
It is due to a partial deletion of the short arm from chromosome X, with consecutive monosomy Xp22.3.	1.0411771199093807
The rapid development of recombinant DNA technology and our enhanced understanding of the genetic basis of human disease has facilitated the development of new molecular therapeutic modalities, termed gene therapy.	1.017252886924197
Gene therapy involves the transfer of functional genes into somatic cells and their expression in target tissues in order to replace absent genes, correct defective genes, or induce antitumoral activity in the tumor-bearing host.	1.0605962547534107
Currently, an increasing number of gene therapy strategies are being investigated in experimental and clinical trials.	1.18163091521664
Despite substantial progress, a number of technical and logistical hurdles must still be overcome before gene therapy can be safely and effectively applied in the human patient.	0.9545335407513666
Since gene therapy involves complex cell processing and can be time consuming and costly, simplifications or even alternative approaches will be necessary in order to establish this therapy as suitable for clinical use.	0.973941328281787
This report reviews various gene therapy stategies and gene delivery techniques currently under clinical or experimental investigation.	0.806667875790688
Special emphasis is given to cytokine gene therapy using gene-modified tumor vaccines for cancer treatment.	0.7984747429188553
Using the PTB simulator, which emits real signals from patients, we examined the precision of the oscillometric blood pressure measurement with the Dinamap 1846 (Critikon) and the HP M-1008B (Hewlett Packard).	0.9688701600740189
For this purpose we simultaneously registered invasive arterial pulsewave, cuff pressure and cuff pressure oscillations of 20 patients from our intensive care unit and stored them in the database of the simulator.	1.0418042769793594
The invasive reference blood pressure values were determined following the recommendations given by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation.	1.0248558403776986
The invasive system showed a cut-off frequency of 35 Hz; the damping constant was 0.21.	0.9344817841440125
With 49 record signals from patients we carried out 15 simulated measurements each.	0.7534052605960163
From a total of 49 bio-signals from patients the Dinamap 1846 was able to process 41 signals and the HP M-1008B 47 signals.	0.8683208003941376
The mean error of the oscillometric blood pressure measurement of the systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure amounted to -2.50 mmHg, 3.35 mmHg (P<0.05) and 1.51 mmHg with the Dinamap 1846 and to -8.5 mmHg (P<0.001), -5.15 mmHg (P<0.001) and -5.58 mmHg (P<0.001) for the HP M-1008B.	1.151694939306131
The 95% confidence limit for the systolic, diastolic and the mean arterial pressure amounts to 56 mmHg, 30 mmHg and 35 mmHg for the Dinamap 1846 and 50 mmHg, 38 mmHg and 35 mmHg for the HP M-1008B.	0.9236700613532962
The differences between that two instruments could be caused by the different algorithms for the calculation of blood pressure values and different artefact detection and elimination techniques.	1.0476892969826421
The results of the performance tests we achieved with the PTB simulator correspond to the results of other clinical examinations.	1.0555704516537872
The American Association for the Advanecement of Medical Instrumentation recommends a maximum mean error of 5 +/- 8 mmHg.	0.9456296839894406
None of the examined instruments lay within these limits.	0.9458008284717453
Due to the systematic and stochastic errors, we think that the Dinamap 1846 (Critikon) and the HP M-1008B (Hewlett Packard) do not achieve performance levels that are adequate for measuring critically ill patients.	0.9077532244438256
Many patients consulting medical emergency services make the initial contact because of psychiatric emergency situations.	0.7992372608138216
However, emergency physicians and their assistants are usually not sufficiently experienced in psychiatry.	1.2906828958042469
Therefore, psychiatric emergencies are sometimes only reluctantly accepted or inadequately treated by these services.	1.1038966482485375
Our present contribution aims at improving this situation.	0.6505129050765107
It gives a review of the main diagnostic groups concerned, their symptomatology and psychopathology, and offers some advice with regard to empathic verbal interventions and counselling in those emergency situations.	1.0863119741731475
3 different types of complex spinal trauma are defined: Type I means a multilevel contiguous or non contiguous unstable injury, type II is described as a spinal injury with concommitant thoracic or abdominal lesion, typ III stands for the coincidence of spinal injury and polytrauma.	0.9830561577602581
Overlapping of different types occurs.	0.8210778760273986
Type I: The incidence amounts according a german multicenter study to about 2,5 %.	1.1509534314419423
Multilevel injuries need to be stabilized for a long distance from posterior.	1.0189167572213145
With a thoroughful analysis the segments to be fused are determined.	0.7818292606262581
Typ II: The leading thoracic injury is a lung contusion which occurs in up to 50 % of the cases.	1.0873212122101383
A CT scan of the thorax during the first diagnostic screening is recommended.	1.029492407817204
Early reduction and stabilization from posterior should be aimed at.	0.7583261336858542
During the first two weeks anterior procedures are contraindicated.	1.0275789821157126
Abdominal injuries are to be found in 3-4 % of all spinal injuries.	1.249906852718086
All organs could be affected.	0.5270211432453983
A typical constallation is the "seat-belt syndrome" with lesions of the upper abdominal organs and a flexiondistraction injury of the upper lumbar spine.	1.064904232442816
The main problem is to make the diagnosis of both components initially.	1.1611152564365272
Most of the patients may be treated in one operation by first taking care of the abdominal injury and than stabilazing the spine.	1.2088484795811703
The prognosis of this combination is favorable.	1.0203670617612706
Typ III: In 17-18 % of all polytraumatized patients lesions of the spine are to be diagnosed.	1.3002401358942475
From these only one third need surgical care.	0.8158352175784963
From 680 patients with operatively treated fractures of the thoracolumbar junction 6,2 % were polytraumatized according to the multicenter study mentioned above.	1.2039700768636112
The risk of missing a spinal injury in polytrauma totals approximately 20 %.	0.7646678610508231
Surgical stabilization should be performed in the primary phase (day-1-surgery).	1.2110098289543125
Additional injuries, potentially time consuming operations with a high blood loss sometimes necessitate a different approach.	1.000765580629818
Non stabilized spinal injuries apparently do not have the same negative effect on the whole organism as long bone fractures.	0.9819643384849697
In the early phase of treatment on the C-spine only anterior procedures and on the thoraco-lumbar spine only posterior techniques should be applied.	1.0491091027857087
Experimental studies have shown that in traffic accidents with frontal impact the new airbag system can significantly reduce the incidence of severe injuries and fatal outcome.	0.9448274720469626
The question of whether the airbag itself induces specific patterns of injury needs further investigation.	0.8861703602077999
Two cases of traffic accidents with airbag protection are presented here.	0.9298831549128214
The first case report clearly shows the life-saving and injury-reducing effect of the airbag system in a traffic accident with frontal impact at 100 km/h.	0.9922372918753176
In the second case only minor injuries of the face were diagnosed initially.	1.111673338439663
Hemodynamic instability occurred after 3 h of hospitalization due to rupture of the azygos vein.	0.8677642195468299
Analysis of the presented cases shows that, besides the well-known benefits, there are certain injury patterns that seem to be related to the use of airbags.	1.0852682075995304
These have not been described before.	0.654381039903352
It is concluded that patients who were involved in traffic accidents with airbag deployment have to be hospitalized and followed up carefully over time, even though they are initially stable, as potentially fatal sequelae of deceleration trauma can occur later.	1.10437698057777
In our opinion it is not possible to estimate the severity of airbag-associated injuries with conventional methods.	1.0458772218213217
A questionnaire with 78 questions concerning the situation of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) sufferers in Germany was distributed to a representative 3000 out of the more than 14000 patient members of the German AS society; 1614 patients (54%) responded.	1.1714514297332559
The age distribution of these patients roughly agrees with that expected due to the distribution of the age at diagnosis and the age distribution of the German population.	1.2832756889240093
The group of patients more than 65 years old is, however, under-represented.	1.1607554766744503
Introduction: Headache is thought to be generated by nociceptive processes within the meninges, followed by activation of trigeminal neurons within the brainstem.	1.053846462010438
The noxious stimuli initially involved in these nociceptive processes are unknown.	0.7529210587240246
A preparation was developed in the barbiturate-anesthetized rat, in which the activation of trigeminal brain stem neurons by selective local stimulation of the dura mater could be observed.	0.9673044912279734
Atherosclerosis is a complex multifactorial disease of the arterial wall, dependent on genetic disposition and multiple other risk factors.	1.0515055784798684
There are probably several candidate genes, that determine the individual susceptibility of the vessel wall to develop atherosclerosis.	1.0651229796109258
In recent years, a growing number of gene polymorphisms, associated with an elevated risk of myocardial infarction, has been identified.	1.2011006206829733
These genes and gene clusters play a crucial role in lipid metabolism, regulation of blood pressure and clotting.	0.9765690351711882
In contrast to rare monogenetic diseases with severe clinical signs and symptoms (e.g.	0.8089574724777594
familial hypercholesterolemia), genetic polymorphisms are relatively frequent.	1.0894624170232414
Due to their frequency, there is a high probability that one individual carries several alleles predisposing to coronary heart disease.	1.0133544708156288
Genetic polymorphisms become clinically important by interacting with lifestyle, environmental factors or endogenous metabolic disorders.	0.8120060798106636
Fourty-nine patients with 50 complex acetabular fractures were treated with open reduction and internal fixation from August 1993 to February 1996 in a prospectively documented study.	0.9130982815243484
The fractures were fixed with small fragment implants through a modified extensile iliofemoral approach (Maryland approach).	0.782459673642075
Thirty-seven patients were polytraumatized with an ISS of 20 pts.	0.8903585753139734
In 10 patients the ISS was > 25 pts.	1.1309880615777215
Good or anatomic initial fracture reduction with a fragment stepoff K 2 mm could be achieved in 48 fracturers (96 %).	0.9392384294083725
Thirty-six patients with 37 fractures could be evaluated after 25 months on average.	0.8684432691022639
In 28 fractures (76 %) the functional outcome was good or excellent according to the d'Aubigne and Harris scores.	1.1064342794346256
Radiological results were excellent in 21 fractures (57 %) and satisfactory in 12 fractures (Heeg score).	1.0185634516581012
In 7 cases (14 %) a postoperative subcutaneous seroma had to be treated surgically.	1.0497483153990632
No wound infections, however, were observed.	1.3034667211214777
Further complications were secondary a loss of reduction in 4 cases (11 %), relevant heterotopic ossifications (Brooker III/IV) in 5 cases (14 %), and aseptic femoral head necrosis in 2 cases (5 %).	1.11817615239375
In two cases a total hip replacement (THR) for posttraumatic arthritis had to be performed.	1.1132616798853794
Two more cases are scheduled for THR due to symptomatic femoral head necrosis.	0.7314950122944642
A good joint reconstruction can be achieved through the modified extensile iliofemoral approach (Maryland) in complex fractures of the acetabulum.	1.0675299709587773
However, the approach related morbidity seems to be worrysome.	1.0451669407810766
In complex fractures with comminution in the roof of the acetabulum the prognosis remains uncertain even in cases where initial anatomic joint reconstruction can be achieved.	1.05346948683274
The discussion on the results of open spinal surgery, in particular, on complications as a result of open surgery, e. g., the so-called post-discotomy syndrome, has led to the development of less invasive methods, especially for treatment of lumbar disc prolapses.	1.1756602032691603
Percutaneous nucleotomy procedures are based on a variety of intradiscal diagnostic and therapy methods, such as discography, retroperitoneal spinal disc fenestration or chemonucleolysis.	1.04373862997543
Since the 1970 s, various methods such as mechanical percutaneous nucleotomy, automated percutaneous nucleotomy, intradiscal laser procedures and, in part, endoscopic intradiscal procedures have been developed and also used clinically.	1.0818795887259158
The clinical results vary from 30 % good/very good results to almost 100 % good/very good results, depending on the author and study.	1.0316650576777888
It is obvious that not many prospective randomized studies using either conservatively or surgically treated control groups have been conducted.	0.9003344857922625
The results of these studies on intradiscal therapy methods are often analyzed more critically and with lower success rates than the partially retrospective studies of a single method, which often have large case numbers, but do not always meet the demanding criteria for scientific study design.	1.1334606593001288
To attain good results, percutaneous nucleotomy procedures can only be used to treat select cases of lumbar disc disorders according to strict indication criteria.	1.0537369786499768
At the present time it can be concluded that, in comparison to endoscopic und microsurgical methods, percutaneous nucleotomy procedures must be restricted to a small number of cases.	1.0960891704870002
A 58 year old patient with hepatitis virus C (HCV) infection had a secondary polyclonal IgG-IgM cryoglobulinemia with a benign 20 year course.	0.9677637798946644
Clincally the patient suffered from progressive pigmented purpura (PPP).	0.7009826270917515
Histologic evaluation revealed a lymphocytic vasculitis.	0.5345710582605337
Food containing tartrazine trig- gered flares of the PPP, as demonstrated with controlled oral provocation testing.	0.9277299147385543
In most of the previously described cases of HCV and type III cryoglobulinemia, the typical cutaneus finding was palpable purpura with leukocytoclastic vasculitis.	1.0612362075760382
Normal aging is associated with changes in body composition, thirst perception, renal function, and the hormonal regulatory systems involved in the maintenance of water and sodium balance.	1.0393219063499597
The presence of many diseases and drugs common in the elderly can interact with the impaired homeostatic systems to result in clinically significant disturbances of water and sodium with accompanying symptoms, morbidity, and mortality.	1.0407948961951201
These disorders, which include dehydration, hypernatremia, hyponatremia, urinary frequency, and urinary incontinence can either be prevented or promptly recognized and appropriately treated by understanding the physiological changes and clinical circumstances which put the elderly person at increased risk for deranged water and sodium balance.	1.0808545618666927
Although valvular stenosis may be evaluated adequately by measuring transvalvular pressure gradients with Doppler echocardiography and cardiac catheterization, these methods have failed to provide reliable and accurate quantification of valvular regurgitation.	0.9742542402490929
In recent years the development of magnetic resonance imaging has broadened the diagnostic spectrum in cardiology, since it allows assessment of ventricular volumes without geometrical assumptions and the non-invasive quantification of blood flow within the heart and great vessels.	1.1525327785994786
The purpose of this overview is to evaluate "established" diagnostic tools and to show the capabilities of magnetic resonance imaging in the assessment of valvular heart disease.	1.170296234658025
Solvent induced polyneuropathy and encephalopathy have been acknowledged quite recently as occupational diseases in Germany.	0.7601613144413514
For compensation first of all the diagnosis has to be proven.	0.9947294701715936
For differential diagnosis other known causes as well as non-organic mental diseases must be taken into consideration.	0.7156647716820328
The causality between proven exposures and diagnosed disease has at least to be probable.	0.7686103841284185
To evaluate causation extensive experience of the experts is needed.	0.7224851076781741
In this context scientific criteria regarding neurotoxicity of the solvent, duration of exposure, individual aspects of non-occupational influences, time course of the disease are important within a thorough synoptic evaluation.	1.1247280122088306
Possibilities and limitations of sensitive diagnostic measures such as neurographic, neuropsychologic and neuroimaging examinations are discussed.	0.7048348885704755
The prognosis of toxic polyneuropathy and encephalopathy is in general favorable if exposure has stopped.	0.8999360839614197
Additionally, adequate therapy and rehabilitation measures are supportive for a good prognosis.	1.1937655277812051
Standard radiography of the cervical spine is still the first imaging procedure applied in degenerative disease of the cervical spine.	0.9882301962769768
Spondylosis deformans, osteochondrosis and uncovertebral arthrosis are well depicted by such images.	0.762615456798273
Whether or not additional imaging is needed depends on the clinical symptoms.	0.9732618988537658
Special projections (anteroposterior oblique radiographs, lateral radiographs in flexion and extension) may be the next step.	1.0596613642877595
For many abnormalities, mainly of the intervertebral discs and the myelon, MR imaging has become the standard procedure, largely because of its multiplanar capabilities and its excellent contrast resolution.	1.1431775510333526
CT can be used instead of MR imaging if the latter method is not available, and its strength lies in the depiction of bone abnormalities.	1.1298558421034561
Scintigraphy is suitable for early detection of abnormalities with unclear clinical symptoms and may then indicate the correct level of the cervical spine for MR imaging or CT. Myelograms and myelo-CT can no longer be considered routine imaging methods.	1.0088473699288072
A number of imaging abnormalities are not strictly related to clinical findings and should therefore always be discussed in the clinical context.	1.264459051753971
We report on three years of experience with a new method of a simultaneous endoscopically assisted anterior release in the prone position, combined with transpedicular posterior scoliosis correction and fixation.	1.148054608170683
In 60 cases this simultaneous approach yielded substantial advantages.	0.6637996715185955
True derotation of the apex - even in the thoracic spine - is achieved.	1.3381022046732973
In cases of total canalicular occlusion or the total absence of the lacrimal apparatus the functional restoration requires the repair of a newly created lacrimal system.	1.0710796764955208
The intraoperatively reestablisted lacrimal drainage from the conjunctival sac will be maintained by a plastic tube.	0.7791557598215745
Beside other criteria the influence of the used inserted materials polyethylene or silicone should be evaluated.	0.9435042881430329
A prospective, randomized and controlled trial is conducted to compare carotid endarterectomy and carotid stenting in high grade symptomatic carotid artery stenoses.	0.9218590212525474
Magnetic resonance imaging is used routinely with much success for various problems in different medical disciplines.	0.9896245019070288
However, the patient is exposed to static as well as to time-dependent magnetic fields and radio-frequency electromagnetic fields.	1.2507952338070352
In 1997 the Strahlenschutzkommission, the German Radiological Protection Commission, passed a recommendation on the use of magnetic resonance in medical diagnostics.	1.0690713728333958
In this recommendation basic values related to thresholds for physiological effects and limits for restricted and unrestricted use are given.	0.8158259233567778
In the following the aim and applicability of this recommendation are discussed, as well as the thresholds and different limits for the static magnetic fields, the gradient fields and the radio-frequency fields.	1.0987518562910508
Additionally, advice is given for the protection of high-risk patients, personnel, and the general public, together with further safety advice as well as recommendations for users and manufacturers.	1.2204472411084015
Six patients with granuloma faciale, including patients with multiple lesions, were treated successfully with cryosurgery.	1.318972338802227
Granuloma faciale is known to be difficult to treat.	0.8539066401759664
Cryosurgery is an effective and minimally invasive therapy for this granulomatous inflammation of the skin.	1.0740405854675514
It should be considered as an alternative to dapsone.	1.1585875172968536
The results of early conversion of war fractures by the application of AO osteosynthesis in A group (n = 32) of the injuried, were compared with B group (n = 187) of injuried, treated definitely with external fixator.	1.324824252199147
There were statistical evaluations and X-ray observations of healing in both groups, as well as the appearances of the most frequent complications such as: Pintract infection, osteitis, pseudoarthrosis and reoperation.	1.064171158331791
Statistically less significant appearance of complications in A group during 2th and 6th month (p < 0.001) was observed.	1.0128368456067067
In 12th month of observation, these differences statistically disappeared.	0.952838923326361
Healing observed by X-ray in 2th, 6th and 12th month of observation were no statistically significant differences between the two observed groups.	0.9113707156635436
Since 1993, 30 patients with acute intraarticular distal radius fractures have been treated under arthroscopic assistance.	0.7584750084110786
In 12 patients (40%) concomitant lesions of the intrinsic scapholunate ligaments were diagnosed.	1.0184346758911575
According to Geissler we found grade I-tear in one patient, grade II in three, grade III in six and grade IV in two patients.	1.0028956669202087
The eight individuals with grade III-and IV-lesions additionally revealed marked instablity intraoperatively.	0.8856228343562091
Therefore, operative stabilization was subsequently performed by temporary scapholunate and scaphocapitate arthrodesis.	1.15390227216592
Seven patients out of this group (87.5%) were followed up clinically and radiologically 3 years postoperatively, on average.	1.1818416491902666
Clinical examination included range of motion tests and a subjective questionnaire concerning pain and working ability.	0.8397137909613155
Objective grip strength was measured using a Jamar tester and compared to the contralateral wrist.	0.9097315771790916
Radiological evaluation consisted of the posteroanterior and lateral view as well as stress views in radial and ulnar deviation.	0.8108683972867506
Data were evaluated by the Jakim and Cooney scoring system as well as the demerit point system by Gartland and Werley as modified by Sarmiento et al.	0.7369029370505515
According to Gartland, 100% of our patients showed an excellent result; these rates were 86% using the Jakim score and 60% using the Cooney scoring system.	1.0860139858388558
According to the subjective questionnaire all of the patients revealed an excellent or good result.	1.1673165265411722
Open treatment of shoulder instabilities is well accepted and still golden standard.	0.9460473322847673
But arthroscopic techniques show also good and comparable results.	0.7767222037798697
Arthroscopic procedures however are not accepted for treatment of failures and revision cases.	0.8122340573425842
Therefore we questioned whether a arthroscopic revision procedure is an option after failed first time open or arthroscopic stabilization.	0.9525942154663591
This prospective study was designed to assess the outcome of arthroscopic revision procedures after failed shoulder stabilization.	1.0071503140410063
In 1991 the diagnosis of cerebral circulatory arrest with Doppler sonography was accepted by the Medical Council of the Bundesaerztekammer as one of the methods able to shorten the waiting time for fulfilling the criteria for diagnosis of cerebral death.	1.0448852461002183
A survey was undertaken to determine how frequently Doppler sonography has been used since that time in certifying brain death.	0.8894280761827866
A total of 400 questionnaires were sent out to all neurological (272) and neurosurgical (128) departments in Germany.	1.0387494162726598
In all, 226 questionnaires were returned.	0.6220808037122482
In 71 departments, Doppler sonography has been used to certify brain death, mostly combined with other methods.	0.9439792071994478
The question of whether false positive results have been observed was answered five times in the affirmative.	1.0553393056187792
The background to these cases was clarified by telephone calls.	0.8483694673447996
In order to indicate pitfalls, the examiners reported borderline situations which in part did not fulfil the prerequisites.	0.938641112195193
In none of these cases had the diagnosis of brain death been based on ultrasound data.	1.1972409444582601
Doppler sonography for the diagnosis of cerebral circulatory arrest has been used by a considerable number of neurological and neurosurgical departments in Germany as an additional confirmatory test and rather seldom as the only method to shorten the waiting period.	1.128798423088654
We report on a 64-year-old man who died within 1 h after admission to hospital with symptoms of respiratory insufficiency.	1.1665314572343732
Autopsy showed as cause of death a clinically unknown coagulase-negative staphylococci-induced left-sided endocarditis with perforation of the aortic and mitral valve.	1.0132993016911012
Infective endocarditis by coagulase-negative staphylococci in native valves is a rare event.	0.9069545712249241
The macroscopic appearance and histological findings are presented and discussed.	0.8152323271985707
Thrombolysis therapy in childhood and adolescence has brought about numerous case reports, but no controlled studies over dosage and duration of therapy have been published to date.	1.1067015053379379
Laserotoscopes are suitable for low-pain outpatient surgery of otitis media with effusion (OME) under topical anesthesia.	0.9000426708411462
The myringotomy perforations should have a diameter greater than 2 mm to ventilate the middle ear for approximately 3 weeks.	0.876831230245097
Comparison by skin epiluminescent microscopy of 60 malignant melanomas and 130 junctional and compound naevocellular naevi revealed statistically significant differences for 12 characteristics.	0.877836136353129
The following microscopical in vivo signs that can be defined by histopathological examination were found only in malignant or premalignant melanocytic lesions: digitated radial streaming, greyish-blue reticular patterns, opaque gypseous alabaster lacunas, brown/black dots on a blue/greyish background, pseudopodia at the periphery and blue-in-pink areas.	0.8810113117079007
Nevertheless, specific epiluminescent phenomena of histopathologically defined malignant melanomas are still unknown.	1.0475851376201504
Therefore, diagnostic evaluation of malignancy is based mainly on microscopic assessment of combined details of morphology and colour of melanocytic tumours.	1.1729008185259215
The present study examines the relationship between different psychological variables (including anxiety, depression, locus of control, expectations of pain intensity and social support) and postoperative pain, analgesic consumption and satisfaction with the pain management in a study sample of 67 patients.	1.1754977189454534
Clinical experience of 11 patients with CHARGE association is reviewed.	0.7116028864642967
The study comprised six girls and five boys.	0.6597020347395417
All presented with congenital heart disease.	0.625770465919292
Eight had bilateral choanal atresia.	0.4934168053183771
Coloboma affecting either one or both eyes was detected in nine children.	0.8874021824797901
Nine patients suffered abnormal pinnae or deafness.	0.6048932963496345
In addition to major abnormalities, further anomalies of the orofacial region and the upper airways occurred in all patients.	1.0878349008466277
All children exhibited velopharyngeal incoordination and swallowing problems often resulting in recurrent aspiration pneumonia.	0.6898764391574393
Three patients had cleft lip and palate.	0.8616993783010753
Both micrognathia and high-arched palate were present in two patients.	0.8500642610999625
Facial palsy was observed in six patients.	0.7551289568313514
Optimal management requires a multidisciplinary approach with active coordination and cooperation between the appropriate specialities.	0.8566884879848384
The anatomical repair of bilateral choanal atresia should be performed as early as possible.	0.8914728212968465
In our experience, the transpalatal approach is far more satisfactory than the transnasal.	0.9281311062193944
It gives the surgeon the opportunity of direct access and anatomical repair.	0.8734193113787646
After the child has grown stronger, a long-term management is desirable including developmental and feeding training.	1.077905012110186
Thrilling are especially those situations, when people have to make ethical decisions.	0.9725838767608252
Issues of medical ethics crop up not only in hospital series, but often in genres where this subject is hardly to be supposed: comedies, westerns, love stories and gangster movies.	1.00311102503451
Enacting these conflicts means offering a solution, and in doing so films refer to moral values and - at the same time - function as seismographs for the social relevance of bioethical topics.	1.1921795144217628
But it is possible that ethical principles of good decision-making fall victims to the drama of the story.	1.046842517273456
Analysis of the portrayed conflict is similar to a case discussion in bioethics and represents a helpful adjunct to the procurement of analytical and communicative competences.	0.8356126501761549
Several experimental studies and randomized clinical trials demonstrate a decrease of local tumor control with increasing overall treatment time of fractionated radiotherapy.	0.9298243698260431
Proliferation or clonogenic tumor cells most likely is the major mechanism underlying this phenomenon.	0.8898823877127284
Important progress in radiation oncology might therefore be expected from inhibition of proliferation of clonogenic cells during radiation treatment.	0.8561922971650715
Possibilities to minimize the time factor are briefly discussed.	0.9444435760539915
Inhibition of proliferation of clonogenic tumor cells during irradiation by simultaneous chemotherapy, by inhibition of signal transduction pathways that stimulate proliferation, or by pharmacological inhibition of angiogenesis are scientifically interesting but currently not proven to be effective to counteract the loss of local tumor control with increasing overall treatment of fractionated irradiation.	0.9567378251458324
At present, the only established approach is to complete radiotherapy within a short overall treatment time, e. g. by accelerated fractionation and by prevention or compensation of unscheduled treatment gaps.	1.0172747161046274
Technical innovations and software improvements in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and high-resolution sonography (US) have definitely influenced the diagnostic imaging of rheumatic diseases.	1.0236814399431267
For MRI, improvements in surface coils, dedicated low-field systems (0.2 T), and software improvements (shorter acquisition times and refinements of fat suppressing techniques) must be mentioned.	1.0310332839037832
For sonography, the main innovations concern the development of higher transducer frequencies (7-15 Mhz) and power Doppler imaging.	1.2497505197074528
Clinical evaluations have shown that MRI and US are most useful in cases of suspected rheumatic disease with negative plain film radiographs and for documenting the course of the disease, diagnosing of early rheumatoid arthritis, making a differential diagnosis in clinically unclear rheumatic diseases, investigating vascularization, and quantifying pannus formation.	1.0311763275812362
In order to improve diagnostic efficacy the role of MRI and US in the management of patients with rheumatic disease should be reconsidered.	1.0961537102584256
In addition to renal elimination and gastrointestinal metabolism (amylase; splenic and hepatic dextranase) colloid plasma solutions like dextran and hydroxyethyl starch deposit in tissues, especially in the reticuloendothelial system (RES).	0.8910661778438
This tissue storage is limited in time (weeks to months), is influenced by the employed solution and other factors (lysosomes) and has usually no clinical importance (no RES blockade).	1.247068223418485
We report here a case study of a patient with sepsis (lung, liver and kidney failure) who had an overload of the RES with colloids while being treated with dextran (molecular weight 40000 and 70000 daltons) and hydroxyethyl starch (mw 450000 daltons, molar substitution 0,7).	1.0792782223073707
In the late seventies and early eighties the toxic shock syndrome (TSS) became epidemic among young menstruating women.	0.8537867775292487
A strong correlation was found between TSS and the rising popularity of hyperabsorbent tampons.	0.9218124012833627
Exotoxin-producing Staphylococcus aureus is seen as the main mediator of TSS in controlled clinical trials.	0.9171832132927901
Menstrual and nonmenstrual forms of TSS are differentiated.	0.6726954747704303
The nonmenstrual form is comparatively rare and has a high rate of mortality rate.	1.0039954032969343
Several studies showed that the overall incidence of menstrual and nonmenstrual TSS is approximately 1-3 cases per 100 000 persons.	1.0409322443716775
The leading symptoms are fever, hypotension, mucous membrane hyperemia, diffuse rashes, myalgias, vomiting and diarrhea.	0.8538559468231791
The severe form of the syndrome leads to multiorgan dysfunction.	0.892098588550077
The streptococcal TSS (STSS) caused by group A Streptococci is clinically similar to the staphylococcal TSS.	0.8776510038689639
Both Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococci produce the exotoxin TSST-1.	0.5728459840153414
New methods allow the detection of TSST-1 production.	0.6151154467921917
However, due to the low incidence of TSS, this method of detection has not yet been taken up in the routine diagnostic procedures.	1.339021547329313
This report focusses on the emergence and spread of S. aureus with special clinical and epidemiological significance.	0.970798569053175
Results from typing MRSA originating from different clinical sources in all Germany reveal that there is a continuing interhospital dissemination of definite epidemic strains and also a spread of the mecA gene to clonal groups of S. aureus which have been until now sensitive.	0.9695605725104716
These newly emerging MRSA are still sensitive to a number of other antibiotics.	0.8341717217573128
This results in less broad resistance phenotypes of currently disseminated MRSA.	0.8062210715998427
Worth mentioning with regard to diagnostics are also three clinical cases of staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome caused by S. aureus possessing secC and not tst.	0.9204067982154983
Background: For cataract surgery in this country retro- and peribulbar anesthesia is the standard method.	1.3603707542273713
It totally stops eye movement as well as sensitivity to pain.	0.7627208831128756
Especially peribulbar anesthesia is known as a procedure with minimal complications, but the potential risks can be severe.	1.1894421696824549
In the past sponge anesthesia could not be used on patients with difficult cataract surgery due to the insufficient anesthetic effect.	1.0406721423010448
A modified anesthetic method is demonstrated for complicated cataract surgery.	0.7971324533443471
In patients with coronary artery disease, it is controversial whether cardiac arrhythmias result from acute subendocardial ischemia.	0.9928264546860573
The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between myocardial ischemia and ventricular arrhythmia.	0.8206824970888267
The immunopathogenesis of cardiac rhythm and conduction disorders has been underestimated.	0.8122714794981785
Therefore, the aim of this review is to analyze the current data and controversial issues in this area.	1.0332121515923782
We report the case of an 8 year old boy with a rare congenital myopathy (with cytoplasmic inclusions bodies) and clinical signs of rigid-spine-syndrome.	1.125149231273993
During treatment of lung tuberculosis disordered breathing with hypoventilation during REM-sleep, hypoxemia and persistent hypercapnia during daytime were found.	0.81031724843492
This complication in myopathies is caused by weakness of respiratory muscles and leads to negative features (like pulmonary hypertension, daytime-sleepiness, growth failure or further impairement of the muscle disease).	0.9123845526703599
Diagnostic steps in disorders of breathing during sleep in children with neuromuscular disease are shown.	1.004665894822825
Aortic dissection with no entry or false lumen flow was recently identified as intramural hemorrhage of the aortic wall (IMH).	0.9470642882346128
Analysis of the literature revealed 209 cases of in vivo diagnosed IMH reflecting 17% of all dissections, whereas in autoptic studies this condition is found in 4-13%.	1.298055075269363
Transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and aortography (to rule out dissection) have been applied for diagnosing IMH in 57, 49, 43 and 38% of the cases, respectively.	1.0659293440476811
However, diagnostic accuracy of each modality is not available to date.	1.3784350714182751
In 34%, IMH involves the ascending aorta (type A).	1.0087977728729567
The average age of patients with IMH ranges between 55 and 65 years; 65% are males.	1.1247441625454873
In 12%, IMH was associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm.	1.0228765793169088
With 87%, arterial hypertension is the predominant risk factor for IMH irrespective of its location.	1.1468465737881417
As suggested by the term "mediastinal apoplexy" IMH may - similar to cerebral apoplexy - result from hypertensive rupture of the vasa vasorum in the aortic media.	1.078670154947173
With 97%, the majority of patients present with acute chest or back pain similar to classic dissection.	1.1039395743742164
Mediastinal widening is found in 83%; signs of hemothorax/pleural effusion are present in 38%, acute aortic regurgitation in 26%, pericardial effusion in 23%, acute neurologic deficits in 12%, and pulse deficits in 5%.	1.2231640227321285
In 18%, IMH progresses to dissection and in another 15% to rupture.	1.435869676307979
In 25% and 28%, respectively, dissection and rupture occur in the ascending aorta and in 12% and 9%, respectively, in the descending thoracic aorta.	1.4583698895878376
The 30-day mortality of IMH is 24% (36% with type A and 12% with type B IMH; p<0.05).	1.0551112988134967
With surgical repair, mortality of type A IMH is lowered to 18% compared to 60% with medical treatment (p<0.01).	0.9610925572426803
In contrast, with 8% mortality associated with medical treatment, prognosis of type B IMH is more favorable without surgical intervention, the latter associated with a 30-day mortality of 33% (p<0.05).	1.1512699265564703
Thus, IMH is a potential precursor of dissection and should be managed like dissection with undelayed surgical intervention in patients with type A IMH and with medical treatment in type B IMH.	1.205407286182433
We report on 3 exemplary case studies of patients with myelomeningocele who are under regular care in our outpatient clinic, and discuss the clinical and diagnostic problems and the therapeutic concept of fractures in patients with myelomeningocele.	1.3395994713289578
Our case reports are in accordance to previous publications; they show that signs of confined and systemic infection and variable X-ray signs with often extensive reactive formation of callus make the diagnosis of fractures in myelomeningocele patients difficult.	1.0654691159433807
Fractures often occur without pain or trauma.	0.6709474883442532
Background: Since the end of the 1960ies, accidents have been identified as the most common cause of mortality in children and account for considerable childhood morbidity in industrialized western countries.	1.2113286686598763
In contrast to traffic-related accidents in older children and adolescents, which were consequently registered and documented, no epidemiological data exist about home injuries and accidents during the first years of life in Germany.	1.2939120400845354
This report presents data on accident-related hospitalizations in a cohort of 10271 infants, who participated in a prospective vaccine efficacy trial in Germany from 1991 to 1994.	1.0529568298987728
One-hundred-thirty patients underwent 53 electrophysiological studies including programmed atrial and ventricular stimulation and 96 atrial overdrive stimulations on an outpatient basis.	0.8937928629418084
The indications for electrophysiological study were disabling palpitation, syncope, or presyncope, intracardiac conduction disturbance, and bradyarrhythmia.	1.021646210130549
In one patient the efficacy of oral antiarrhythmic drug therapy was evaluated by repeat electrophysiological study.	1.0382569606603387
Atrial overdrive stimulation was performed in patients with atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia.	1.0986560272152153
On the basis of the result of electrophysiological testing, 25 patients were believed not to require any treatment, 16 patients received new drug therapy, 7 patients underwent catheter ablation in a second session, 2 patients had either a pacemaker or an ICD implanted, and 1 patient continued to receive the drug therapy that had been tested.	1.3085412661491063
Atrial overdrive stimulation resulted in a regular sinus rhythm in 66 patients (69%).	0.8259785827832946
Except for one patient in whom atrial flutter could not be terminated, atrial fibrillation was induced in the remaining 30 patients.	1.1521463008074517
After the procedure, patients were monitored for 30 min in case of overdrive stimulation, and for approximately 3 h after electrophysiological study or 6 h if additional coronary angiography had been performed.	1.1704988734129802
Severe complications were not observed.	0.5198781435485983
In 10 cases minor hematoma occurred at the puncture site without serious sequelae.	0.8491548324230054
- Outpatients electrophysiological study as well as atrial overdrive stimulation are feasible and safe in a selected group of patients.	0.9955910471765097
Endosteal implants after tumor surgery of the face are helpful in reconstructing facial defects.	0.9082668855136753
A retrospective study of our patients treated using craniofacial implants was conducted to evaluate long-term results.	1.2163243169798117
A total of 128 implants were inserted, 110 implants in the periorbital, 12 implants in the mastoid, and six implants in the paranasal region; 113 implants were short craniofacial Brånemark implants, and 15 implants were dental implants.	1.1351742350255962
The success rate for implant survival was 94.5%.	0.9590837277420273
Long-term results were promising and more than satisfactory, leading to a large indication for these endosteal implants.	1.1959628549932328
The term "Ecstasy" includes a group of different methylenedioxyamphetamines which produce hallucinogenic activity, stimulation and the so-called 'entactogenic' effects.	0.8996892618376862
- "Entactogen" is usually translated as "producing a touching within" or "creating an internal contact" and refers to the special psychotropic effect of this substances.	1.1531996917744065
Entactogens have been reported to make users aware of previously unconscious feelings and experiences.	0.9493320087965746
The "entactogenic" effect is the most typical of the psychedelic effects n 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDMA).	0.9948410926294303
MDMA induces euphoria and acts stimulating, but the most common effect of MDMA is a heightened sense of "closeness" with other people.	1.200022863139929
The negative effects, especially depression and a general sense of anxiety, may endure after the acute phase of ecstasy.	1.2608814106252935
Ecstasy is not a novel substance.	0.9412903028288258
However, the rapid spread connected with the arising techno-scene and the increasing prevalence of ecstasy-use world-wide is unprecedented.	1.0626851580871592
Cisatracurium - one of the ten stereoisomers of atracurium - is an intermediate long-acting non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent.	1.1936791981743369
Cardiovascular reactions have been described after administration of cisatracurium or vecuronium in surgical patients.	0.9011661850441933
After approval by our institutional review board, 62 patients (ASA I-II) were randomly assigned to three groups to either receive 3xED95 or 5xED95 of cisatracurium or 3xED90 of vecuronium prior to intubation as a bolus.	0.7961119508553249
After oral premedication with 2 mg lormetazepam anaesthesia was induced with thiopental (4-12 mg/kg) and maintained with O2/N2O and isoflurane (1.5%-2%).	0.92987596981574
Six minutes after administration of thiopental, patients received the muscle relaxant.	1.120539590053264
Six minutes later 0.1-0.2 mg fentanyl was given and the trachea was intubated.	0.8295121818296736
Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were monitored every minute.	0.7578047312481697
Changes of heart rate or blood pressure >20% compared to baseline were defined as clinically significant.	1.066042042667597
After application of the study drug, median values of blood pressure and heart rate were stable.	1.1015104126457267
For each muscle relaxant, there were several patients who had statistically significant cardiovascular changes.	1.0971652190583792
After 3xED95 cisatracurium, 3 of 21 patients exhibited haemodynamic changes >20% (2 exhibited hypotension and 1 tachycardia), while in the high-dose cisatracurium group 2 of 21 patients demonstrated a tachycardia that was predetermined to be statistically but not clinically significant.	1.2441011905534571
In the vecuronium group, 2 of 20 patients sustained statistically significant hypotension and 1 patient had statistically significant tachycardia.	1.1248252422983356
The frequency of all individual cardiovascular changes after the application of the muscle relaxant was not dose-dependent.	0.9610069995756471
After the administration of cisatracurium in two different doses (3xED95 and 5xED95) or vecuronium (3xED90) only minor cardiovascular changes were observed.	0.9997655351928904
Both drugs proved to be safe for use during induction of anaesthesia in patients ASA I-II.	0.8871367938309156
With regard to its cardiovascular effects, cisatracurium shares with vecuronium the requirements of an ideal muscle relaxant.	0.9400249374123307
Between June 1993 and September 1995, 18 distal femoral fractures were treated using the supracondylar intramedullary nail.	1.0003787082218747
There were 8 type A fractures and 10 type C fractures (AO classification).	0.8075219204922726
The operative technique involved retrograde insertion of an unreamed supracondylar nail through the intercondylar notch.	0.9024222211274352
Follow-up was available on all patients and averaged 18.3 months (range 6-32 months).	1.2100043690459856
All fractures healed with an average time to union of 12.4 weeks (range 8-16 weeks).	1.3153213784017603
Bone grafting was not necessary in any case.	0.9348925045097669
Sixteen patients achieved almost the same ROM as they had had before the injury.	0.8582070331706462
One patient developed a varus malignment and underwent correction with a supracondylar osteotomy 20 months post trauma.	0.853501700436974
There were no infections or nonunions.	1.0087867512627517
The retrograde supracondylar nail is an excellent alternative to plate osteosynthesis in the management of dia- and supracondylar femoral fractures.	1.0672780059807305
Autolyzed, antigen-extracted, allogenic (AAA) bone is an osteoinductive preparation of completely demineralized bone matrix.	0.7953105730539528
It has been clinically applied for years.	0.87361569359265
In an experimental study in rabbits, we evaluated the influence of cortical bone and periosteum on the amount of bone formation following augmentation with AAA bone.	1.069664124937499
Two implants of standardized size were placed on the femoral bone of rabbits.	0.9567121075440351
A cell-excluding PTFE membrane was wrapped circularly around the femur as well as the anterior implant shielding the implant from the surrounding periosteum.	1.093118634783204
The posterior implant was exposed directly to the periosteum while being shielded from the cortical bone by the membrane.	0.9031117067519668
Thus, two compartments were created selectively, preventing contact between the periosteum or cortical bone and the implants.	1.1858553315731781
For each compartment the area and volume of the induced new bone were evaluated by computerized radiograph analysis and quantitative CT (pQCT) scans.	0.9650318446075203
Implantation of AAA bone led to new bone formation in both compartments.	0.8263919762096072
Contact of the periosteum and the implant led to an almost fourfold increase in bone volume.	1.0549084774698405
Although bone formation showed interindividual variations, the difference of both compartments was highly significant using the Student's t-test for paired samples (P < 0.0001).	0.9295147709505356
The data show that periosteum is the primary source of new bone formation in augmentations with osteoinductive materials as it is rich in inducible progenitor cells and is well vascularized.	0.9838208868749284
In osseous augmentations with AAA bone, the periosteum should be preserved in order to achieve a close contact of the osteoinductive implant.	1.0833152909720907
Shielding from the periosteum, e.g., by cell-excluding membranes, leads to significantly less bone formation following implantation of AAA bone and should therefore be avoided.	1.05883007203165
Computed tomography is a significant source of medical radiation exposure for populations in Europe.	0.9230652138362705
Reduced radiation exposure may be possible with modern CT scanners with an image quality that while less good than before remains acceptable for clinical purposes.	0.9001152020960637
The lung appears particularly well suited to investigation with low-dose CT owing to the high contrast between normal and diseased pulmonary parenchyma.	1.05421074952933
Undernutrition, particularly protein undernutrition, contributes to the occurrence of osteoporotic fracture, by lowering bone mass and altering muscle strength.	1.0528610265375187
Furthermore, the rate of medical complications after fracture can also be increased by nutritional deficiency.	1.0459146995153392
The IGF-I system appears to be directly involved in the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to osteoporotic hip fracture in elderly and to its complications.	0.9095799459128474
In the presence of adequate calcium and vitamin D supplies, protein supplements increasing the intakes from low to normal, raises IGF-I levels, improves the clinical outcome after hip fracture, and attenuates the decrease in proximal femur bone mineral density in the year following the fracture.	0.9936170035808306
This nutritional approach is associated with a significant reduction of the stay in rehabilitation hospital.	1.0224245721648149
This underlines the importance of nutritional supports in preventing and healing osteoporotic fractures.	0.7640736269190745
The article discusses changes in the context within which the social professions are exercised.	1.1004706799734527
The chances for a refinancing of social work and indeed its very locations change in line with the transition to new steering elements in the social body and the new implementation of competitive elements in the realm of public law.	0.9543328932490034
With the economising of the social sphere social work is questioned under economic aspects.	0.7859757774530524
Simultaneously it gains normative significance.	0.5376518145434878
This is true with regard to standards for the quality of services and institutions, and further in the context of the discussion concerning the revitalisation of local social policy for the elderly.	1.0549416567829588
Precisely the economising of the social sphere raises the question whether the municipalities may be excused from their responsibility to form, preserve and support the obligations of social work with the elderly.	0.9245142584617951
A comparison was made of the staining intensities of selected immunohistochemical proliferating antigens (p53, PCNA, Ki67), DNA flow-cytometry and ultrastructures of neoplastic cells from 120 cases of laryngeal cancers.	0.9956978066837976
Clinically very advanced tumors were in the majority (T3, 43%; T4, 18%).	1.1336166481669618
A 5-grade scale was adopted to evaluate the level of immunohistochemical staining of the carcinoma cell nuclei.	1.0258365765747621
Positive staining was obtained in 70% for p53, 57% for Ki67 and 80% for PCNA.	1.390385561859933
Sixty-two percent of the cases were DNA-diploid and 38% DNA-aneuploid.	1.069753933391166
The DNA-diploid carcinomas were accompanied by enlargement of the cell nuclei, preservation of wide margins of nuclear heterochromatin, enlargements of the nuclear areas and increases in the number of nuclei.	0.9539128556832178
In the aneuploid-polyploid cancers the nuclei had a substantial polymorphism, with large cleaved nuclei showing significant variations in size and having a nuclear envelope.	0.9105593960539035
A frequent finding was euchromatization of chromatin.	0.5761151657431609
Dense chromatin appeared in the form of small clumps spread over the whole area of these irregular nuclei.	0.8664308694892697
Enlargement and activation of nucleoli were found.	0.626083735305281
The antipyretic analgesics still comprise the most widely used group of analgesic compounds.	0.7580838681019105
Until twenty years ago, aspirin, phenazone derivatives and acetaminophen had been used as standard remedies for intercurrent harmless pain conditions in connection with infections, trauma, small surgeries, but also for tension headache and other painful conditions.	1.0271878036517448
During the last decades, this group has been supplemented by a variety of 2-arylpropionic acids being primarily developed for the treatment of rheumatic pain and inflammation.	1.102978827846773
Some of them (e.g.	0.27487940903158375
ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen) have been given over-the-counter status in some countries because of their relative safety at low doses.	1.0682097801612063
Nevertheless, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic differences among the various substances of this group make them suitable to a different degree for the treatment of pain conditions.	1.1302424632360666
A 38-year-old man presented with an intracranial extra-axial tumour at the base of the left posterior fossa which proved to be a meningeal melanocytoma.	1.0621576341743533
Meningeal melanocytoma is a rare, benign melanotic tumour of the leptomeninges occuring predominantly in the posterior fossa or the upper spinal cord in adults.	1.001091693929899
It shows characteristic cytologic features with isomorphic epitheloid or spindle-shaped cells, often with prominent nucleoli and a variable content of intracytoplasmic melanin.	0.9250804150224348
It usually lacks signs of malignancy such as high mitotic rate, necroses or infiltrative growth and shows a low labeling index in proliferation marker studies.	0.8658595179491783
Its immunohistological profile with S-100 protein-, vimentin- and HMB-45-positive tumour cells is similar to that of (primary or metastatic) malignant melanoma.	1.2616124994330504
This differential diagnosis is crucial because of the totally different therapeutic and prognostic implications.	1.0804891994222776
Therefore, everyone dealing with surgical neuropathology should be familiar with the rare, but clinically important diagnosis of meningeal melanocytoma.	1.1095811940610403
A 54-year old, obese woman suffered from massive symmetrical swelling of the face, especially of the upper and lower eyelids.	1.0263957789045535
Initially the swelling occured intermittently, but after 2 years it was permanent and progressive markedly limiting her visual fields.	1.03290608844843
Neither laboratory findings nor imaging procedures provided any firm evidence of an underlying cardiac, renal or endocrinological disease.	0.9817155919479367
There was no suggestion of a storage disease.	0.8733225111181381
Skin biopsy showed foam cells and granulomatous inflammation, so the patient was tentatively diagnosed as having a monosymptomatic Melkersson-Rosenthal Syndrome.	1.0787765639296378
Eyelid surgery was performed to improve her visual fields.	0.970593144664182
Treatment with clofazimine 100 mg daily was initiated.	0.663873298526061
Regular follow-up visits over 7 months revealed no evidence of recurrence.	0.8232774959307657
The patient died a sudden cardiac death a few months later.	1.1570566753755684
The relatives refused an autopsy.	0.48592985315125875
The definite cause of her facial swelling remains unclear as we discuss the differential diagnostic possibilities.	0.9899914605128667
An 81-year-old patient had prolonged competitive neuromuscular blockade with train-of-four ratios of 0.1 and 0.5, respectively, after two successive anaesthesia procedures (enflurane-N2O/O2; vecuronium-succinylcholine-sequence) for transurethral prostate resection.	1.168693306445062
Although antagonism with neostigmine was promptly successful after the first, 65-min period of anaesthesia (1.5 mg vecuronium for precurarization, 100 mg succinylcholine for intubation, 3 mg vecuronium), repetitive and chronologically staggered administration of neostigmine after the second, 30-min period of anaesthesia (1 mg vecuronium for precurarization, 100 mg succinylcholine for intubation) had hardly any effect, so that the patient had to be ventilated mechanically for a total of 4.5 h. Laboratory analysis revealed homozygous, atypical, plasma cholinesterase (790 U/l; dibucaine number 23; genotype E<![CDATA[|lefbop|a<![CDATA[|clobop||opnbop|1<![CDATA[|clobop|E<![CDATA[|lefbop|a<![CDATA[|clobop||opnbop|1<![CDATA[|clobop|).	0.968215627761951
This retrospectively confirmed a succinylcholine-induced phase II block in both instances, as had already been suspected following the second anaesthetic procedure.	1.0173080296007522
The degree of block transformation, and thus the available time, are decisive in explaining the diverse effects of antagonism here.	1.1747262877233804
It must be assumed that a complete phase II block developed after the first succinylcholine exposure owing to the longer duration of anaesthesia; the purely competitive component (train-of-four ratio 0.1) was easily antagonized by neostigmine.	1.1424494870484916
At the time of the attempted antagonism after the second, shorter period of anaesthesia, however, block transformation was still incomplete (train-of-four ratio 0.5).	1.064081269005605
The administration of neostigmine therefore rather intensified the depolarization segment of the mixed block, so that repeated attempts at antagonism then inhibited any further block transformation.	0.8912881335242211
The Ph1-negative groups of chronic myeloproliferative diseases (CMPD) are described, and histopathological criteria that distinguish them from each other are given.	1.0327833099396035
These are based upon observations in primary biopsies from 2,331 patients with CMPDs among a total of 34,160 patients referred between 1 January 1989 and 30 June 1994 to the Bone Marrow Registry.	1.1023344162500013
These cases of CMPD break down into the main groups as follows: CML 23.2 %, megakaryocytic myelosis consistent with agnogenic myeloid metaplasia 22.3 %, essential thrombocythemia 22.1 %, and polycythemia vera 20.4 %; 12.0 % of cases were unclassifiable.	1.1643379455933112
Histological progress in each group is characterized by (1) increasing number and pleomorphy of megakaryocytes, (2) increasing fibrosis, and (3) excess of blasts.	1.0928609404308123
These three features can be observed in diagnostic biopsies before any therapy.	0.9323183557531889
Therefore, it is recommended that such alterations be reported semiquantitatively.	1.1455698865124024
A staging system with four stages from 0 to 3 for each of the three features is introduced.	1.1099345718331888
Its application allows staging for the individual patient on the basis of diagnostic biop-sies.	0.9662201898532676
Chondral and osteochondral lesions as well as bone bruises of the ankle are caused in the most cases by trauma and are localized almost exclusively at the talus.	1.1861219669283112
For diagnosis, operative management and follow up, magnetic resonance imaging was useful, which can be further improved by application of intravenous or intraarticullar contrast enhancement (Gadolinium).	1.0106583079115452
In adults operative therapy is favored.	0.6769142189801979
Due to new techniques, arthroscopy became an important alternative to arthrotomy.	0.9438530050251442
According to the stage of the disease, drilling or curettage, removal or fixation of the fragment, autologous bone transplantation or osteochondral graft can be performed.	0.9528989077630701
All procedures can be managed arthroscopically.	0.8610237455870735
General Psychotherapy isn't a new type of therapy, but it could be a paradigmatic model for all empirically-oriented psychotherapists.	1.0745633522158038
The contents of this model are defined.	0.8993139728692169
Arguments and reasons are put forward as to why the practice of psychotherapy should be guided by empirically based procedure rules instead of by therapy methods.	0.8293865817070206
The procedure rules should be joined together by a theoretical conception of psychological functioning, from which their relative significance and prescription conditions can be derived.	0.9223905390483135
A consistency-theory based model of psychological functioning is sketched, from which conclusions can be drawn about the emergence and maintenance of psychological disorders on the one hand and the prescription conditions of different therapeutic procedures on the other.	1.037312510951185
The advantages of this model in view of a general psychotherapy are discussed.	1.1864610739558363
In the Federal Republic of Germany, no data existed regarding the frequency of open heart surgery for excision of cardiac neoplasms.	1.0221176066172182
Therefore, a standard questionnaire concerning heart tumors was sent to all 77 German heart centers performing cardiac surgery.	1.0559740968304463
Although induction chemotherapy administered prior to local therapy produces encouraging initial response rates in head and neck cancer, randomized studies have failed to demonstrate an improvement in survival rates.	1.0625505091740906
All randomized studies included only patients with advanced stage III and IV disease.	1.0423770610289138
In our opinion, this is the main reason for the low rate of complete responses demonstrated in the randomized trials (maximum 18%).	1.055217837422928
estimate that a 40%-50% complete response rate is necessary before improved survival rates are seen.	1.1101211044629797
To date, such complete response rates with induction chemotherapy have only been attainable in resectable T2-T3, N0-N2 disease.	1.0581398702921352
Therefore, we initiated a prospective randomized trial including only patients with the mentioned disease stages.	1.2699705073436502
Patients (pts) were randomized to receive either induction chemotherapy with three cycles of carboplatin/5-FU prior to surgery and radiotherapy (arm A, 70 pts) or standard treatment with surgery and radiotherapy (arm B, 74 pts).	1.1544787193683763
Patients were classified according to primary tumour site and neck disease.	0.9566839006224145
The observed remission rate after chemotherapy confirmed the primary estimated rate for this subgroup of patients with head and neck cancer (CR: 43%, PR: 37%, NR: 15%, PD: 5%).	1.1958159040892706
After a follow-up of 12-96 months overall survival was 58% in arm A and 45% in arm B (n.s.).	1.1708344334993093
Disease-free survival in arm A (61%) is statistically significantly better than in arm B (43%, P=0.03).	1.2533746632755827
Therefore, we recommend further controlled trials to investigate the role of induction chemotherapy in patients with primary resectable carcinomas of the oral cavity and tonsils and stage T2-T3 and N0-N2 disease prior to surgery.	1.1490902256632847
Minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass surgery has evolved as a reliable method to perform left internal mammary artery (LIMA) bypass surgery to the LAD.	1.0681476247728106
This novel technique represents a synthesis of known approaches to coronary surgery using sternotomy without extracorporeal circulation and limited access techniques in general thoracic surgery.	0.8843955444254447
Applying specially designed tools for both harvesting the internal mammary artery and mechanically stabilizing the anterior surface of the heart during anastomosis, this approach is gaining widespread acceptance.	1.0616119910798552
A steadily growing number of patients with proximal LAD lesions are submitted to cardiac surgery and the procedure is performed with increasing success rates, now approaching 98% short term patency.	1.0966066538288077
In a specific series war injuries in the trochanteric region were characterized; a limited methodological approach magnified the problem.	0.9528119786441455
Our experience and the treatment results (debridement, drainage and external fixation) are presented.	1.0526187312252913
The methodology, complications and final results are also given for 15 patients.	0.9918744923673288
Consolidation was achieved in primary external fixation without additional procedures such as spongioplasty or internal fixation conversion methods.	0.873687164708812
The time to consolidation without complications was 28.6 weeks (24-36) and with complications (deep infections, chronic osteomyelitis) 40.8 weeks (28-68).	1.1956849109310466
In total, there was one poor result with angulation, shortening of the extremity and chronic intermittent fistulation.	1.1931534411762958
The average follow-up was 22.7 months (1-34 months).	1.1820201902219796
Our personal experience and the results speak on behalf of external fixation.	0.9186830219687313
Under war conditions, primary fixation ensures the best late anatomical and functional results.	0.8285505483291159
Minimal osteosynthesis improves the final outcome if the rules of application and the indications for selection are adhered to strictly.	0.8698933843214101
Introduction of the computed tomography index CTDI and the multiple scan average dose (MSAD) has led to standardization of the dose description in CT examinations.	0.9258727897565939
Despite the use of these dose parameters, many different dosages are reported in the literature for different CT methods.	1.1704894190545447
In addition, there is still a wide range of radiation dosimetry results reported for conventional CT, helical CT, and HRCT used in chest examinations.	1.1642154354673138
The variations in dosage are mainly due to differences in factors affecting the dose, i. e. beam geometry, beam quality, scanner geometry ("generation"), and operating parameters.	1.0316006484354427
In addition, CT dosimetry instrumentation and methodology make a contribution to dosages.	1.1110977779106153
Recent studies calculating differences in factors affecting dosage and CT dosimetry and using similar operating parameters, show similar results in CT dosimetry for conventional and helical CT. On the other hand, dosages for HRCT were greatly reduced.	0.9537568717636813
This was mainly caused by narrow beam collimation and increasing section spacing.	0.6982360852212411
Central pulmonary embolism represents one of the most threatening complications in surgical patients.	0.9961257906843114
In most cases deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities is the source of emboli.	0.9151182917260752
Despite the introduction of hypocoagulative drugs in standard surgical concepts the incidence of deep vein thrombosis remains about 10 % in trauma patients.	1.1009555637027173
Estimated numbers of unknown cases of pulmonary embolism are supposed to be rather high too.	1.0280734849001034
In haemodynamically symptomatic pulmonary embolism events and especially when the patient has to be reanimated, mortality rates of up to 93 % are reported in literature.	1.217280647034458
After introduction of the heart- and lung-machine in the surgical concept of therapy, survival rates have increased significantly.	1.2324910111424725
We report on three cases of successful surgical embolectomy after CPR.	1.1619847227884688
In a review of literature current concepts of treatment in central pulmonary embolism are discussed.	1.1635613995831955
Imaging of tumors of the pancreas may have a series of significant implications for surgical decision making.	0.9989072348486512
First of all verification and localization of a suspected tumor is crucial.	0.8747671455125647
Later on, accurate staging of local tumor extent and of distant metastases is necessary for evaluating the indications for surgical intervention.	0.9977506352190408
If histologic proof of malignancy of a pancreatic lesion is needed, different imaging techniques can be used for percutaneous biopsy of the tumor.	1.0741037080638411
Finally imaging is required in patients with a pancreatic tumor if an obstruction of the common bile duct is treated with palliative intent by endoscopy or transhepatic intervention.	1.0105938480617882
A rational and efficient selection from all the imaging techniques currently available requires a clear-cut definition of what is needed for surgical decision making in each individual case.	0.9218650766404608
Thereby one has to take into account whether the tumor arises from the exocrine or from the endocrine tissue of the pancreas.	0.9793878371725926
In spite of the importance of skin diseases in Africa south of the Sahara, dermatology is insufficiently represented within the established primary health care systems.	0.9756620413014875
Aim of this study was to find out whether an integrated dermatology project could reduce the prevalence of dermatoses.	0.9100373023309368
Magnetic resonance imaging has shown to be a sensitive method for diagnostics of the red bone marrow, the composition of which changes physiologically and during pathological processes.	1.1233215270864256
However, the interpretation of MRI in patients with disorders of the red bone marrow is very difficult.	1.0951497835283956
The aim of this study was the characterization of the proton spectrum of healthy bone marrow and its age- and sex-dependent changes to obtain a data basis for measurements in patients.	1.1100165570800489
We report a case of a 26-year-old patient, a tilelayer by profession, with a history of a fall from a height of 5 meters with blunt thoracic injury and resultant left atrial rupture.	1.0519026722806397
The emergency doctor found at the site of accident a deeply comatose patient (Glasgow Coma Scale 3 points) with no recordable blood pressure.	0.9755329166150987
After two hours of resuscitation at the site of accident and at the closest emergency traumatology unit a marginal blood pressure was seen.	0.9868200040321523
With a suspicion of a closed ascending aortic rupture the patient was transferred to the nearest cardiothoracic surgical unit.	0.8826548432210413
During transfer, the patient had a cardiac standstill with asystole and was further reanimated and resuscitated.	1.05342678638246
On arrival the patient was transferred to the operation theatre immediately and after femoro-femoral cannulation was supported by a heart-lung-machine circulation.	1.0027149422768253
Through an optimal exposition the internal thoracic organs were inspected in detail and the rupture of the left atrium was identified and treated.	1.0424645738896292
The heart was effectively emptied and with deep hypothermia with a reduction of oxygen consumption by all organs especially the brain was taken care of.	0.9477606870449715
The patient could be discharged from hospital on the 18th postoperative day in absolute good health.	0.7074987814877381
Since mitochondrial diseases lead frequently to severe phenotypes and are often hereditary, there is a need for genetic counselling of the affected families.	1.031224474352995
The specific features of mitochondrial genetics, however, hamper straightforward definition of recurrence risks as in Mendelian diseases.	1.0427844585349482
Empirical risks were recently provided for MELAS and MERRF syndromes and for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.	0.7200403929642137
In MELAS and MERFF, higher levels of mutant mtDNA in the mothers' blood were associated with an increased frequency of affected offspring.	0.9281790487736904
Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia and Kearns-Sayre syndrome are in general sporadic disorders without increased recurrence risks in the offspring.	0.8665257866011032
As Leigh syndrome is found with maternal, autosomal recessive or X chromosomal transmission, the definition of the molecular defect is crucial for genetic counselling.	1.0076409269809168
Prenatal diagnosis was reported only in one case of mitochondrial disease so far, and in our opinion it remains questionable because of the uncertain correlation of the proportion of mutant DNA in chorionic villi and in  clinically relevant tissues such as brain.	1.2408511979337578
An accurate and complete depiction of the halo naevus has been left by Matthias Grünewald in his painting "The Temptation of St. Anthony", which is part of the Isenheim altar piece (1512 - 1516), which is now exhibited in Colmar, Alsace.	1.135476710852867
In contrast, Sutton in 1916 only described a "leucoderma acquisitum centrifugum", leaving the nature of the central lesion in the dark.	1.1509908183139865
The term Sutton naevus therefore appears less appropriate than the alternative eponymic designation "Grünewald naevus".	0.7903477999061211
In women with breast cancer, staging of the tumor plays an important role and often is considered to be the most prognostic and therapeutic factor.	1.1899203204838735
The most widely used staging system is based on the pathologic TNM classification.	0.8435776779317811
In recent years conservative therapies such as preoperative chemo- or radiotherapy are used more often with limited tissue evaluation resulting in insufficient or even inaccurate staging data.	1.051354461289649
Tumor size as well as nodal involvement is decisive in selecting a treatment method and assessing the response.	0.9033859557273355
Thus, more accurate preoperative in vivo staging is necessary.	1.206734353274545
This article therefore gives an overview of the different imaging modalities (mammography, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear medicine) used for breast cancer staging.	0.9841889252007523
Furthermore, results of these methods are compared critically with the pathohistologic staging.	1.3583572714006789
The lack of muscle control in neurological disorders often leads to deformities of the foot.	0.6861267321120758
The equinus (a contracture of the triceps surae muscle), the abduction and clubfoot deformity are the most common ones.	1.1380590118823017
The present paper describes the deformities and stresses the functional relevance for the patient.	0.8066980372353071
Therapeutic principles of the conservative orthopaedic means are described with special emphasis on the need of an adequate height of the aide and the foot position.	1.0921288011696426
Casting and the application of Botulinun toxine are described having a major side effect of muscle weakening.	0.8379448199343567
A combination of the different procedures, surgical interventions included, need to be selected for each patient offering the best management for each individual problem.	1.1604252731236908
Still's disease was originally described as one form of rheumatoid arthritis in children beginning with fever and other systemic symptoms.	1.0244312906543103
In rare cases it may also begin in the adult and is then referred to as adult-onset Still's disease.	1.0089920335396751
The diagnostic criteria include typical rash, arthralgias, bouts of fever, and leukocytosis, as well as lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly, liver dysfunctions, non-infectious angina, and absence of rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies.	1.057242047109102
We report two adult patients with longstanding disease whose exanthema guided us to the correct diagnosis.	0.9368903640728871
The rash is a finding with high sensitivity.	0.8595302172895006
It is characterized by red macules with distinct borders and is evanescent.	0.733971848766523
During an acute flare of the rash, gentle friction induces erythematous, isomorphic (Koebner) phenomena, which, as we describe here for the first time, may persist longer than the remainder of the fleeting rash.	1.0381393002018369
Objective: Patients in a surgical intensive care unit (ICU) have a high incidence of nosocomial infections which often lead to septic shock and death.	1.2245357752640254
Since calculated antibiotic treatment is often difficult, it was recommended to obtain routine nose/throat swabs in order to have a better idea of the causative agent when a systemic inflammatory response occurs in a given patient.	1.1465341554029216
Methods: In 1435 patients of our cardio-surgical ICU, routine nose/throat swabs were taken three times a week and tested for micro-organisms and resistance to antibiotics.	0.9515031220117649
Of these 86 patients developed clinical signs of systemic inflammation, and additional blood cultures were obtained.	0.9308496679396838
Antibiotic treatment was achieved to cover the microbes from the nose/throat swabs, or a calculated dosage was given to patients whose swabs had tested negative.	1.0929719077026263
Results: Of the 86 patients with systemic inflammation, 29 had blood cultures positive for microbes.	1.2860327293641052
Of these 29 patients, 18 received a calculated antibiotic coverage based on their positive nose/throat cultures prior to the return of the blood cultures from the lab.	1.1307838577757632
However, in only 11 of the 18 patients were routine swabs and blood cultures positive with the same microbes.	1.28010009307704
While positive routine swabs are quite specific for sepsis when there is a systemic inflammatory response, routine swabs are not a suitable screening tool due to their low sensitivity.	1.0431321090017975
Conclusions: Routine nose/throat swabs led to earlier specific antibiotic treatment in only 22% of our patients with clinical signs of systemic inflammation.	1.144950500786669
In addition, in almost 40% of the cases organisms detected in the routine swabs and blood cultures were not identical.	1.3565455669414828
As a result, we feel that routine swabs are only of limited value in instituting earlier, specific antibiotic treatment in septic patients.	1.0603592517702676
The influence of defensivity, measured by validity scales of personality inventories (MMPI-K, FPI-R, GIESSEN-Test) on test results and psychotherapy outcome was studied in 309 patients treated with inpatient client-centered therapy.	0.9322671575081836
In general, psychotherapy patients exhibited low defensivity.	0.8003177503779864
25% of patients, who denied psychopathology at admission, did so at discharge and to some extent at follow-up, demonstrating an "especially good outcome" (means).	1.0363197568996265
Relative improvement (effect sizes), however, was significantly diminished in psychopathology scales and significantly enlarged in validity scales.	1.1740111417680088
- Results are discussed with regard to prior hypotheses about the influence of defensivity.	0.930232861511536
In our study we tested 2 different rapid assays for cardiac troponin t (TropT-rapid assay, diagnostic cut-off 0,2 ng/ml and TropTsensitive-rapid assay, diagnostic cut-off 0,1 ng/ml) in 75 chest pain patients.	0.9664503273413859
Additional to the emergency ECG (3-lead) we acquired a 12-lead ECG.	1.2348078245518592
The TropT-rapid assay showed a sensitivity of 11% (specifity 94,3%).	0.8746151580042529
The TropT sensitive-rapid assay showed a sensitivity of 62% (specifity 100%).	0.8789108406685826
Despite the great number of publications during the last 10 years concerning the indication, technique and results of operative treatment of acetabular fractures, conservative treatment still has an important role when considering the therapeutic possibilities.	1.1138766492706564
Because of the modern techniques of radiological imaging and improvement of diagnostic facilities, a more defined indication for treatment becomes possible.	1.1202440246473702
Conventional X-rays, completed by special projections like the Ala and Obturator view, and a CT scan allow determination of the fracture type (the Letournel/Judet classification or the AO classification).	1.1784881859261391
The most suitable treatment can then be adapted to the individual circumstances of the patient, i. e., age, general condition and overall severity of traumatic impairment.	0.9438179222831667
Determination of the intact part of the weight-bearing dome is important in selecting the most adequate therapeutic procedure.	0.9121193828764569
The larger the intact roof arc, the better the prognosis.	0.9208288588632877
Together with the X-ray controls following axial and facultative lateral extentions, the indication for conservative treatment can be confirmed.	1.0249484121886867
Early active motion of the injured limb, followed by walking exercises with partial weight-bearing, are important aspects of nonoperative treatment.	1.1303784620905564
Conservative treatment is recommended in non-displaced fractures or in fractures with little displacement, transverse fractures of the lower region or severely comminuted acetabular fractures with no possibility of reconstruction.	1.1110365093929868
Our clinical and radiological follow-up of 97 patients with acetabular fractures from the years 1981-1990 showed that the majority were treated conservatively (approx.	1.121361385481554
The functional result after an average observation period of more than 70 months was good or excellent (based on the Merle d'Aubigné score).	0.9638503661317567
We feel it is important to look at operative and conservative treatment of acetabular fractures as two complementary non-competitive therapeutic methods.	0.9396085013944279
The choice of treatment should be based on an exact diagnosis considering fracture type, the individual circumstances of the patient, and application of the necessary diagnostic facilities.	1.12166515764569
Conservative treatment can lead to excellent long-term results.	0.8022097244450102
Problem There is a great need to expand current knowledge of the various functional capacity measurements used in the rehabilitation of chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients.	1.0992587641707567
The literature on these patients reports that mobility, endurance, trunk strength and lifting capacity decrease during the process of chronicity.	0.9363346409961928
Chronically disabled patients appear to have lower functional capacity than asymptomatic persons.	0.8158421795387116
Methods Our study group consisted of 90 disabled CLBP patients (44 female, 46 male; average age 42 years) who underwent a multidisciplinary 8-week daily treatment program of functional restoration with behavioral support (instruction, endurance training, strength exercises, behavioral and treatment to facilitate return to work therapy).	1.052659185947879
Initially these patients where compared with 107 asymptomatic persons (44 female, 63 male, average age 41 years).	0.8378622568168433
The patients were investigated before and after treatment, and at intervals of 6 and 12 months.	1.2870364415372435
The reliability of the functional measurements was evaluated by interrater comparison.	1.0287568163488952
Physical assessment included a medical examination (mainly diagnosis of radicular or nonradicular pain), changes in the lumbar spine revealed by X-ray studies according to Herron and Turner [50], rating of physical impairment according to Waddell [117], flexibility, length of hamstrings muscles (SLR), test of power and endurance of trunk movement by standardized exercises according to the Swiss group of Spring [102] and isokinetic measurements (LIDO Back), tests of lifting capacity (LIDO Lift), and (in part) of general endurance on a cycle ergometer (CASE 15 Marquette).	1.1800086973722874
Results Physical findings showed that mobility was reduced substantially in patients suffering from back pain due to reduced SLR (shortened hamstrings) and decreased spinal mobility.	0.9458115547444069
Patients also demonstrated significant reductions in their ability to perform lifting tasks in comparison to healthy individuals.	0.953086709623832
The results of trunk flexion showed no significant differences between patients and the control group, whereas the ability to perform trunk extension was much better in the control group.	1.1027749474359845
In principle we found the same results with isokinetic measurements as in the exercises without machines.	1.060098833452047
Cardiovascular endurance was also much better in the control group than it was in the back pain patients.	0.9820024379377884
At the end of the treatment program all physical deficits were improved significantly.	0.9572264464968756
In many cases performance was comparable with that of the control group.	0.8999140386965957
With time, however, training effects gradually decreased.	1.0430616497355005
The success of treatment (return to work, absence from work, pain reduction, use of medical care) was independent of the functional status of the patients before and after treatment.	1.2058940021970006
Conclusion Study results showed that physical capacity in disabled patients with low back pain is substantially reduced in comparison to persons who do not suffer from back pain.	1.0455115957932823
The only exception was in trunk flexor strength and endurance, in which measurements did not differ between the patients and the control group.	1.2330548780833526
However, even CLBP- patients with long-term pain and severe physical illness can successfully improve their physical condition by participating in an active treatment program.	1.261043029142338
Back extensor muscle training has to be included in physical therapy.	0.8401775619031994
Because of loss of condition during the time after treatment, regular monitoring of patients and their home training programs is necessary.	1.0653468199813296
Overall, treatment of CLBP has to include physical training and psychosocial treatment to achieve satisfactory results.	1.0761107844628988
The dynamic behavior of the ossicular chain is very complex and is frequency-dependent.	0.8401138969553107
To date, this has still not been fully investigated or understood.	1.0327346659846737
There remains a lack of measurement procedures to pick up the motion of the ossicles and ear drum simultaneously with sufficient resolution.	0.9515895428395038
The presented paper reports simultanous measurements with laser-Doppler vibrometry at two points of the ossicular chain of cadaver specimens.	0.9017838249914234
Motions not observed were derived using mechanical simulation models on a computer and then evaluating appropriate mathematical equations.	0.8489177353790079
Using a sound stimulus, the displacement velocities of the umbo and stapes footplate were measured, and the corresponding transfer functions were derived by Fourier transform.	1.0793821445977545
Results were used for verification of the computer models.	0.8796955998312711
In the current investigations these models were refined and allow for the detailed investigation of the dynamic behavior of the ossicular chain, facilitating the optimal design of passive and active middle-ear implants.	0.9841047954183266
Problem: Postoperative nausea and vomiting remains an important problem.	0.9977450815925492
Many risk factors have been identified; however, the importance of postoperative analgesic technique and patient expectation remain poorly defined.	0.9824525587585923
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are probably not only unintended, toxic side-products of oxygen metabolism in mammalian cells, they also have several important physiologic functions including antimicrobial killing, regulation of cellular proliferation and growth, and regulation of vascular tone.	1.056226958292887
ROS are generated within the vessel wall by several mechanisms, including a vascular type of a NAD(P)H oxidase.	1.0923906590091468
ROS formation can be stimulated by mechanical stress, environmental factors, the peptide angiotensin II, cytokines, native low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and in the presence of catalytic metal ions.	1.0631881814905226
Their ability to modify LDL, react with endothelial-derived nitric oxide subsequently forming peroxynitrite, and amplify the expression of various genes important for leukocyte recruitment within the arterial wall are the basis of the oxidant injury theory of atherosclerosis.	0.980504727904624
In animal studies, antioxidant therapy (probucol, butylated hydroxytoluene, N',N'-diphenylendiamide, vitamin E, superoxide dismutase) have been successfully used to prevent fatty streak formation, and to restore impaired nitric oxide-dependent vasorelaxation.	1.0556344844124732
In man, antioxidant therapy (e.g., supplementation with vitamin E) clearly increased the resistance of LDL to oxidative modification.	0.805355466326421
Case-controlled and prospective clinical studies suggest a relation between baseline antioxidant plasma levels and/or antioxidant supplementation and risk of cardiovascular events.	0.9244115126571201
In one secondary prevention trial (randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled), vitamin E supplementation reduced significantly the risk for non-fatal myocardial infarctions.	1.0872367511903709
Before general recommendations can be made, results of further large-scale trials should be awaited.	1.034799274216192
A 36-year old man suffered an isolated head injury with a fracture of the skull, epidural and subdural hematomas as well as brain contusion (Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS): 5 points).	1.087689042683816
The hematomas were evacuated by craniotomy.	0.5066451200371247
Because of high intracranial pressure (ICP) a barbiturate coma was necessary.	0.8799779191644816
Additionally, the patient demonstrated acute lung injury (ARDS) due to pneumonia 8 days after trauma.	1.0846674491304793
The patient recovered slowly and was transferred to neurorehabilitation on day 57 after injury.	0.8152514834814684
During the following 12 months the patient developed a significant deficit of hip motion (extension/flexion: right: 0 °/10 °/20 °, left: 0 °/10 °/30 °; external/internal rotation: right and left: <5 °/0 °/<5 °; abduction/adduction: right: 10 °/0 °/25 °, left: 10 °/0 °/10 °).	0.9805627783616029
X-rays and CT-scanning revealed severe heterotopic ossification (HO) of both hips with ancylosis (Brooker type IV).	1.0894057484402548
Resection of HO was carried out in a two stage procedure using Smith-Petersen approach.	0.8910184093718769
The prophylaxis for recurrence of HO included preoperative single-dose radiation (8 Gy) and postoperative treatment with indomethacin (150 mg per day).	1.1213592672446682
The patient revealed 15 (left hip) and 12 (right hip) months after surgery the following range of hip movement: extension/flexion: right: 5 °/0 °/90 °, left: 5 °/0 °/100 °; external/internal rotation: right: 20 °/0 °/30 °, left: 20 °/0 °/20 °; abduction/adduction: right: 30 °/0 °/40 °, left: 30 °/0 °/40 °.	0.8937095448835038

patent foramen ovale revealed significant differencies for age, hypertension, diabetes and use of oral contraceptives.	0.8421296710136762
Cardioembolic sources showed significant differencies for atrial fibrillation and atrial septal aneurysm.	0.7431930200609769
Multivariate analysis of risk factors for atherosclerosis and cardioembolic sources revealed hypertension and diabetes as age dependant risk factors in patients with closed foramen ovale.	0.8514223779340939
In patients with patent foramen ovale the use of oral contraceptives was found as an independant risk factor for cerebral ischemic event.	0.9665242688140878
Patients >60 years with cerebral ischemic events had more often a closed foramen ovale.	0.9563543362572614

A retrospective study of 86 motorcycle accidents that occurred in the year 1992 is reported.	1.0313973600754622
Examination of the case histories supplemented by telephone conversations yielded the following results: 90.7% of our patients were male and their average age was 28.8 years; the age group between 25 and 30 years was the most frequently involved (27.9%).	1.267662705435611
Most motorcycle accidents happened during weekend trips out in the summertime.	0.6957038127003313
Special injury patterns were found for injuries of the upper and the lower extremity.	1.223998904343222
Lower extremity injuries (46%), and especially open tibia fractures (19.7%), were among the most common injuries sustained by motorcyclists in crashes.	1.2013414127319255
Injuries of the upper extremity most frequently took the form of fracture of the distal radius (18.8%).	1.0952010470917226
The average stay in our hospital was 35.4 days.	0.9718489887662244
In 23.4% of cases the patients had to change their job after the accident.	1.3744228236619638
More than half the crashes happened with motorcycles with between 500 and 750 cc stroke volume.	0.8046519852577054
Over a third (34.5%) of the patients had held their driving licences for more than 8 years.	1.1520992212995127
A plea is made for more preventive measures, such as better driving instruction, better road conditions and legislative changes, against motorcycle crashes.	0.9304727246926257
From the aspects of cost and the rate of complications it is reasonable to strive for a surgical treatment as soon as possible after the crash.	1.0631111005074612
Reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) is a syndrome affecting an extremity after a minor trauma or operation.	0.9651058292188011
At the moment there is no consensus about the pathogenesis of RSD.	1.1061875497153788
In 1942 Paul Sudeck suggested that the signs and symptoms of RSD may be provoked by an exaggerated inflammatory response to injury or operation of an extremity.	0.9305600126813595
His theory found no disciples, as most physicians believe that RSD is initiated by an hyperactive sympathetic system.	1.0029964017405284
We performed various clinical and experimental investigations, including the effects of antiinflammatory treatment.	1.0475667442626024
The results of these studies support the theory of Paul Sudeck.	1.0233945235636415

Hypertensive disorders associated with pregnancy are classified into three groups: chronic, treatment, and preeclamptic hypertension.	0.944446324550925
Whereas chronic and transient hypertension do not affect the outcome of pregnancy appreciably, pre-eclampsia presents a potential danger to mother and fetus.	0.8844858470570204
Pre-eclamptic hypertension is accompanied by low cardiac output and plasma volume.	0.786316032218935
An upregulation of angiotension receptors enhances vascular reactivity, with the consequence of high peripheral resistance.	0.9764106456328739
For antihypertensive therapy hydralazine, -methyldopa, and magnesium sulfate are the drugs of choice.	1.149443820011556
A generalised recommendation of anaesthesia for the pre-eclamptic gravida cannot be made because both general and epidural anaesthesia have risks of severe side effects.	0.9136525271419271

The combination of histological, immunohistological, and molecularbiological techniques enabled a subgroup analysis of the incidence of enteroviral myocardial RNA in patients with inflammatory cardiomyopathy in comparison to patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.	0.9677835356254202
The Intended-Dynamic Group Therapy, until the unity almost unknown in West-Germany, represented the most important form of therapy in the former GDR.	1.0079882237845292
Its development, its conception of the relevant relationship between group-dynamic and psychoanalytic concepts and in particular its reception of psychoanalytic concepts are discussed.	1.020250611816814
This raises the question of defining the position of this therapy form with the focus on the controverse about its proximity to psychoanalytic therapeutical concepts.	1.0057717875134387
Even if we take into account that in the GDR there were very reduced possibilities to articulate psychoanalytic and particularly drive concepts, in our view the Intended-Dynamic Group Therapy cannot be considered as a psychoanalytical form of therapy.	1.1602690014195542
It represents a specific therapeutical development of the former GDR which is strongly oriented at social norms.	1.0443408307772772
It is first of all oriented at the attitude change reached by the group, that means, at the manifest, conscious behaviour of the patient and therefore focusses at the normative level of behaviour regulation in groups in the sense of interactional group therapy.	1.1202043636792194
The authors view this form of therapy as a "historical compromise" in the field of psychotherapy under the circumstances of the former GDR and in this way they take into account both its advantages and its weaknesses.	1.1989070590104494
In a prospective study of central fractures of the talus, radiological data (plain radiography, CT, MRI) were scrutinized in terms of correlation with histological findings (biopsy taken at time of screw removal).	1.196736948304986
The study looked at nine fractures in eight patients aged 14 - 48 years.	0.9921454988201631
There was one fracture of Hawkins type I, one fracture of type II, four fractures of type III, and three corpus fractures.	1.268855689958187
All were operated on within 24 h after injury; seven had screw fixation, two had adaptation with K wires.	1.021700693178241
The patients were kept non-weight-bearing for 14 - 53 weeks.	1.167235241513719
Duration of follow-up was 2 years or more in all but one patient.	1.2094384326396923
In the final radiograph the talus was intact in four patients, while four showed a partial avascular collapse; in one patient, a partial collapse was doubtful.	1.2206789903956778
Histology taken 16 - 52 weeks after injury showed osteocyte-free original bone in all cases, with deposition of new bone varying in extent.	1.0522324849587545
Hawkins sign was partially positive in six patients, positive in one, and negative in one.	1.046673198906755
Decalcification as well as fracture healing can be better followed by CT than by plain radiography.	1.010113104072865
MRI appeared normal in five patients, partially pathological in two, and abnormal in one.	1.1222195053448656
A positive Hawkins sign and normal signal behavior can be seen as prognostically favorable signs.	0.9091515332800612
However, in the case of a central talus fracture, even with a favorable course osteonecrosis of at least a part of the talus with gradual replacement by new bone occurred.	1.2861307269589974
Vascularization of the central talus seems to be disturbed more frequently than is reflected radiologically.	1.0983864748986518
Purpose: To assess the value of functional magnetic resonance urography for the noninvasive postoperative evaluation of renal transplants.	0.887150197052838
Methods: A saturation inversion projection sequence allows the selective imaging of strongly T 1 weighted signal from the MR contrast agent.	0.985038980514861
A coronal slab leads to images comparable to conventional urography which can be acquired as a sequence with four images per minute.	0.8831188662936861
Results: 15 patients with urologic questionable findings after renal transplantation were studied.	1.1386778900972303
FMRU revealed in 6 patients normal findings, in 6 moderate dilatation of the renal pelvis without any urodynamic relevant obstruction.	1.1407676206265709
3 pathologic findings, ureteral leak, ureteropelvic-junction obstruction and ureteral stenosis were diagnosed and consequently surgically treated.	0.8672814547497226
The imaging quality in all studies was diagnostic and urologically relevant.	0.8505957709385686
Conclusion: FMRU can be used as a noninvasive technique for the assessment of renal transplant in cases with suspicion of complication in the excretory system.	1.1702572206660053
The infection after intramedullary nailing is a severe complication, which is hard to eradicate.	1.1223527547056416
The results of reaming the intramedullary canal after removal of the infected nail were evaluated in our investigation.	1.0475060039968533
From 1984 to 1991 fifty-five patients with infected intramedullary nails of the lower extremity were included in this trial.	1.0001538998069393
Twenty-one patients had an infection of the femur.	0.9229756352263842
Thirty-four patients had a primary infection of the nail, twenty-one patients had multiple operations with periods of infection prior to nailing.	1.106834627446678
All patients had signs of a chronic osteitis and sinus formation.	0.9136430217262722
At the time of the follow-up the success of the procedure was evaluated regarding recurrence of infection, range of motion of the extremity and patient comfort.	1.1547328960943997
The mean time of observation was 10,1  +/-  4,9 years.	1.2012771578730221
All patients with initially infected intramedullary nails had no recurrence of the infection, compared to 62 % of those with multiple operations prior to nailing.	1.1417410863738824
At the time of the follow up all fractures had healed.	1.087787437699178
85 % of the patients performed full weight bearing.	0.9708085500988838
32 patients (91 %) had good or excellent ROM of the adjacent joints.	1.0824247071370272
The discussion about the therapy of the posterior cruciate ligament persists.	1.1136571156042228
Conservative treatment, augmented repair, and reconstruction with autografts are discussed.	0.8212939655835106
From 1993 to 1997, 49 patients with posterior cruciate ligament rupture had repair Trevira ligament augmentation of 3 mm.	0.8960319505818846
There were 21 isolated and 28 combined ruptures.	0.7818688964433157
In 5 cases bony avulsions were refixed by screw or additional hook plate.	0.8137787430317281
Investigation of 36 patients, in 15 cases with isolated ligamentous ruptures was made.	1.1727510801148333
Osseous avulsion had good results in all cases.	0.8721103109491732
Isolated posterior cruciate ligament rupture showed good stability in 7 of 15 cases and instability of 2 + in 8 cases.	1.1171605368769197
The medial range Lysholm score was 76.8 (+/- 21.6), the OAK score showed 2 very good and 5 good results, 3 fair and 5 bad results.	1.1698705086007066
Using the IKDC score led to 3 very good and 4 good results, 2 fair and 6 bad results.	0.9664638601069213
Using subjective criteria, 10 patients described results as very good or good, 2 fair and 3 bad.	1.0843956348707335
Posterior cruciate ligament rupture with additional knee injury or fracture of the leg showed bad results in 60 % of cases, and good or fair results in only 40 %.	1.0950799120751598
We think augmented repair of fresh injury of the posterior cruciate ligament can be used as an alternative therapy to reconstruction with autograft.	1.1622792180588615
Through cooperation between the German Contact Dermatitis Research Group (DKG) and the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK), results of standardized patch tests performed by the participating centres are centrally recorded in Germany.	1.101148760917254
For this study, data from 24 departments of dermatology (19678 patients) were evaluated retrospectively and separately for 1995 and 1996.	1.1343063555128898
With decreasing frequency, nickel, fragrance mix, balsam of peru, and thimerosal yielded positive reactions most often; suprisingly high numbers of positive reactions were also seen with amerchol L-101 and palladium.	0.879774996073021
Differentiated lists of allergens were compiled for 1995, referring to subgroups of patients (defined by gender, age, localization of eczema, geographical region, occupation, sensitization) and particular problems.	0.953439540125483
In men, percentages of positive reactions were markedly lower for nickel, fragrance mix and balsam of peru than in women.	0.7112084867777746
Younger patients reacted more often to thimerosal and older ones to topical medical preparations.	0.7494713297277892
Medical allergens were also often positive in patients with leg eczema, whereas occupational allergens were found more frequently in patients with hand eczema.	1.0964473005658333
A comparison of positive reactions obtained in distinct geographical regions was problematic because of differences between test populations.	0.8935398433916092
The spectrum of allergens found in officeworkers was similar to that of the whole test population.	0.9565405130237292
Patients with positive reactions to nickel and fragrance mix had more positive reactions to unrelated allergens than the total test population.	0.9720473169649846
Sex- and age-adjusted frequencies of sensitization revealed a decrease in reactions to nickel and an increase in reactions to mercury allergens from 1995 to 1996.	0.9087138950964869
The clinical relevance of mercury reactions was often not apparent.	0.7903369285917358
Differentiated lists of allergens can be used to improve the quality of diagnostic and prophylactic procedures in allergic contact dermatitis.	0.9312590050378882
Intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin (BT) induce a localized, long-lasting paresis of the target muscle that can be graded by the BT dose administered and that is free of major side effects.	1.0427919508580794
With this profile, BT can be used for symptomatic treatment of various disorders caused by pathological muscle hyperactivities.	1.0121044797207444
These disorders occur frequently in patients in institutions for neurological rehabilitation.	0.8892241025387376
They are difficult to treat with conventional methods, can cause major suffering and induce substantial costs for our health care system.	0.991062131174615
In the present study we therefore sought to delineate the use of BT in rehabilitative neurology.	1.021584623542988
Regardless of the etiology of the particular muscle hyperactivity syndrome, five main indication groups are identified: (1) improvement of function of the hyperactive muscles; (2) relief of pain in the hyperactive muscles; (3) improvement of patient care; (4) avoidance of sequelae in joints, tendons, ligaments, and teeth; (5) various special indications.	1.0530304689681949
Myocardial infarction shows a circadian pattern with a maximum in the early morning hours.	1.0664761242783494
In patients with sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD), it is assumed that apnea-associated changes of hemodynamics, blood gases, and rheology lead to a higher frequency of myocardial infarction during sleep.	1.2648110415483182
This investigation analyzes the circadian pattern of myocardial infarction in patients with and without SRBD.	0.8436351764543776
Currently no serological marker for the monitoring of uveal melanoma and its metastases is available.	0.86997165748124
The novel tumorassociated antigen Melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA) is expressed in the uveal melanoma and it's metastatic lesions.	0.9849070045945968
Persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with shortened action potential duration (APD) and reduced atrial refractoriness.	0.9914975409088349
Remodeling of ion currents responsible for AP morphology has been proposed as a major mechanism in persistent AF.	0.895108641165828
In the present study we investigated the activity of the cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel and the mRNA transcription of the cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel subunits in patients with persistent AF compared to patients in sinus rhythm (SR).	1.001003144481873
Right atrial appendages of 10 patients in SR and of 5 patients with AF were used for myocyte isolations to record L-type Ca2+ currents (ICa,L) by the patch-clamp technique.	1.1213238401654142
Right atrial appendages of 16 patients in SR and of 5 patients with AF served as sources for determining the mRNA expression of the L-type Ca2+ channel 1c-, 2/-, a-, and b/c-subunits by semiquantitative RT-PCR.	1.1463093286163928
ICa,L density was reduced by 70% (p < 0.001) in AF patients compared to the sinus rhythm group.	1.009217501470486
Cell sizes, expressed as cell capacitance, were identical in both groups.	0.8850812128286438
mRNA expressions of the 1c-subunit and the b/c-subunits were reduced in AF patients by 18.9% (p < 0.05) and 77.7% (p < 0.005), respectively, while mRNA transcriptions of the 2/- and the a-subunits were not significantly different between SR and AF patients.	1.1365079941797176
A decrease in the availability of functional L-type Ca2+ channels in AF patients, due to reduced 1c-subunit and substantial lack of b/c-subunit transcription seems to contribute to the shortening pf APD and refractory periods in AF, thereby favoring increased atrial excitation rate and perpetuation of AF.	0.97808380760518
34 patients aged 3 months to 20years underwent transcatheter-occlusion of their patent ductus arteriosus with detachable coils (Cook).	0.8883731923551931
Eight patients had a residual ductus after previous implantation of a Rashkind-occluder; 7 patients had various other cardiac malformations in addition.	0.982541421323224
Only 6 patients had a large ductus with a diameter between 3 and 4 mm; all had systolic-diastolic murmurs.	1.0676485379652707
All other patients had ductus-diameters below 3 mm; three of them had systolic-diastolic murmurs, 17 had systolic murmurs, and 8 patients had no murmur at all.	1.1240385649173776
The ductus was closed in 24 patients using artrial access only, in 6 patients via a venous, and in 4 patients both via venous and arterial catheterization.	1.263861889962787
One coil was used in 23 patients, 2 coils in 9, and 3 coils in 2 patients.	1.368149104514162
There were no complications of the intervention.	1.0346007929782148
Within 24 hours 31 patients (93%) had complete closure of the ductus and 32 patients (94%) after 6 months.	1.0843662895523443
Coil-embolisation of the persistent ductus is a quick, safe and cheap method to close a ductus and has clear advantages compared to an operation.	0.9398943527919744
The volume of preoperative screening investigations for outpatient anaesthesia ranges from few, selectively ordered investigations to extensive routine diagnostic procedures.	0.8485460009615017
It seem appropriate to reevaluate benefit and efficacy of routine preoperative assessment programs.	0.9289936900091931
The purpose of preoperative diagnostic is to assess the risk of anaesthesia and surgery for the patient.	1.3421051661628371
As shown by a number of studies, preoperative screening investigations seldom disclose new pathological findings of clinical relevance.	1.0774607192864603
Abnormal laboratory results in otherwise healthy patients rarely alter the anaesthetic management of the patient and are not related to perioperative complications.	1.0971384359247407
Extensive use of costly diagnostic procedures considerably increases health care budgets.	0.764063610436683
A more selective approach to order preoperative investigations promises considerable savings.	0.7808767624428343
To achieve costeffective evalulation an efficient organisation of properative assessment must be established to avoid costly delay and on-day-of-surgery-cancellations.	0.9613768440767325
There is no medicolegal obligation to perform routine diagnostic testing.	0.8789495409397481
The anaesthetist must be sufficiently informed in time to assess the perioperative risk of the patient and to alter anaesthetic management as necessary.	1.200517426216208
According to the presented studies a clinical history and a thorough physical examination represent an effective method of screening for the presence of disease.	1.1441323959385665
Careful medical history evaluation and physical examination can avoid extensive investigations in apparently healthy individuals and the latter should only be ordered if indicated.	0.9232429699332662
The botryoid odontogenic cyst (BOC) is considered a rare multilocular variant of the lateral periodontal cyst.	1.1293463753096828
The origin of the BOC can be seen in aberrant odontogenic tissue.	0.9306640675765734
The BOC is found especially in the premolar region of the mandible, as well as in the frontal region of the maxilla of patients aged between 60 and 70 years.	1.2379566626833216
Most of the 11 published articles of BOC have shown high rates of recurrence.	0.8720995120837501
Histopathologically the BOC is marked by multilocular cysts lined by a thin, nonkeratinized epithelium.	0.8374359248810787
Clusters of glycogen-rich epithelial cells may be noted in nodular thickenings of the cyst lining.	0.9117635297941068
For the clinician, the differentiation of the BOC from the keratocyst and ameloblastoma is relevant.	0.951302275244513
One case of a large BOC (65-year-old male, BOC regio 33-45, diameter 5 cm, radiographically and histologically multilocular) is presented with a review of the literature, including the therapeutic management, and the possible diagnostic criteria are discussed.	1.2595482712177164
The immunohistochemically determined expression of cytokeratin (CK) 13 implicates the histogenetic origin of the BOC from the squamous epithelium of the oral cavity and excludes the origin from the small salivary glands.	0.9429477481887776
The expression of CK 19 and the lack of expression of p53, as well as the higher proliferation rate of the basal epithelial cell layer by the BOC, may be useful for distinction between the keratocyst.	1.103795184288521
Within the framework of a study on vocational rehabilitation of the mentally ill, we examined 83 schizophrenic outpatients enrolled in a work therapy program.	1.1132685991439661
The course of illness and rehabilitation was documented over a 3-year period by means of annual follow-up examinations.	1.149485820856847
The sample comprised 44 men and 39 women with an average age of 35 years (SD +/- 8,5).	1.031442845288357
The majority were chronically ill patients with a history of frequent and long psychiatric hospitalization.	0.9797726565588952
After 3 years, 22% of the patients were integrated into the general labor market, 26% had sheltered employment, 23% were still in work therapy, and 29% were unemployed.	1.4213398901944014
Besides the patients' subjective expectations, early introduction of rehabilitative measures and a favourable course of illness were found to be predictors of a successful rehabilitation leading to vocational integration.	1.1221182008948989
Outpatient work therapy is a contemporary, effective organizational form of sociotherapy.	1.0036285230128827
It may contribute to improved vocational competence and integration, reduced psychiatric hospitalization and stabilized psychopathology.	0.9246574109353971
Objective: Based on personal observations the neuromuscular blocking potency of atracurium was supposed to be diminished in purulent intrathoracic diseases.	0.9995020932576375
This hypothesis was tested in a prospective clinical trial.	0.9811302587394148
Aim of study: Goal of this survey is to give an overview of anaesthesia for caesarean section in Germany.	1.2621492844268551
Ultrasound contrast agent is used in color Doppler flow imaging for signal enhancement in perfused vessels.	0.8748164001790131
We present our experience with its use in the head and neck area and the results obtained.	1.281646799355598
Up until now, 30 patients with carcinomas of the oral cavity or the maxillary sinus, tumors of the mandible and metastatic or inflammatory lymph nodes have been examined.	1.056437000742658
Conventional B-scan sonography was supplemented by non-contrast color Doppler flow imaging.	0.8150753118208856
Depending on the indication, 2.5 g Levovist in bolus or 4 g fractionated was injected intravenously in a concentration of 300 or 400 mg/ml.	1.01570459209192
The administration of the contrast agent was tolerated by all patients without any side effects and in all cases led to a remarkable enhancement of the Doppler signals.	1.1994871963778682
About 15 to 30 s after injection, an enhancement in perfused vessels was detected.	0.9692082320580572
The fractioned injection of 4 g led to a lengthening of signal enhancement up to more than 10 min and to the possibility of examining more parts with a single application of contrast agent.	1.1220164358941982
In 64% of the lymph nodes, vessels could only be identified with the administration of Levovist.	1.1169926631299312
The general vessel topography could be better evaluated in 83% of the cases.	0.8374894671646649
The lymph-node-supplying vessels were identified in 8 of 11 patients after the injection of contrast media.	1.0948170883882167
Additional information, which was gained in 17 patients, increased the certainty of diagnosis or of the therapeutic concept.	1.395921604206344
In three cases, the examinations with the signal enhancer resulted in a change in therapy.	1.0231295304252273
By applying signal enhancer in color Doppler sonography the fields of examination in the head and neck areas can be expanded.	0.8158041035323449
Non-syndromic neurosensory recessive deafness (NSRD) is one of the most common human sensory disorders.	0.9973817807650227
Mutations in the connexin 26 gene have been established as a major cause of inherited and sporadic non-syndromic deafness in different populations.	1.0046844950066403
Laser-induced thermotherapy is an in situ ablation method for the local treatment of liver tumors.	1.0634703081511612
The basic prerequisite for induction of adequate treatment volumes for clinical use was the development of a thermostable application system.	0.9679280224144611
In an ex vivo test series, the specially developed application system (diffuser tip) with 5760 J had a higher thermic loading capacity than the Ringmode applicator with 4200 J, thus enabling the induction of significantly larger lesions with a volume of 7.6 cm3.	1.0474559573281186
The results of a further in vivo test series demonstrated that the lesions were subject to a four-phase connective-tissue organization within a 6-month period.	1.1530542183355943
Furthermore, the same laser energy (4200 J) was associated with a significantly lower lesion volume of 2.5 cm3 in the in vivo than in the ex vivo test series.	1.1885154908428543
The influence of liver perfusion on the inducible lesion volume was examined in a further animal experimental study.	0.962963063413407
By temporarily interrupting hepatic blood perfusion (Pringle's maneuver) during laser application, the effective volume could be increased to 50.3 cm3 (P < 0.01) using an optical beam splitter.	1.061159482834231
These results show that the technical prerequisites for reliable clinical application of laser-induced thermotherapy have been fulfilled.	0.9809996844397844
A total of 222 urogenital specimens were investigated with a commercially available polymerase chain reaction (Amplicor test) for the direct detection of Chlamydia trachomatis.	1.1088947988220004
The results were compared with those yielded by the conventional cell culture technique.	0.9526196081834597
Using cell culture a urogenital C. trachomatis infection could be detected in 72 of 222 patients.	0.9759630003329823
The Amplicor test yielded a positive result in 83.	0.7497250598138927
Referred to the detection rate of the Amplicor test and that of the cell culture, sensitivity was 91.2% for the test sensitivity and 79.1% for the cell culture.	1.364597392890409
The specificity of both techniques was 100% when the specimens for which neither both nor either one of the tests gave positive results were considered.	1.185088421808109
In accordance with other studies, this study suggests that tests based on nucleic acid amplification will supersede cell cultures as the gold standard for the detection of C. trachomatis and also become the method of choice in routine diagnosis of urogenital chamydial infections.	1.0748056352673439
Incidence and clinical significance of cardiopulmonary complications of acute cerebral lesions are still unclear.	0.9117518343153767
Neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) is characterized as an acute, protein-rich lung edema occurring shortly after cerebral lesions associated with an acute rise of intracranial pressure.	1.1743476919089635
NPE is infrequently diagnosed, usually in association with head trauma.	0.87709683472514
Pathophysiological mechanisms include a rise of the pulmonary vascular hydrostatic pressure either due to sympathetic innervation with pulmonary vasoconstriction or increased left-atrial pressure following systemic arterial hypertension or an increase in pulmonary capillary permeability.	1.0488668257102691
In contrast to NPE, cardiac complications are frequently observed, most consistently in patients with subarachoid hemorrhage.	1.2353922855651724
Typical ECG changes are repolarization abnormalities, similar to those observed in coronary heart disease, and cardiac arrhythmias.	1.0138928480473217
The CK-MB may be slightly elevated; echocardiographic findings show a depressed left-ventricular function.	0.8253771285431787
Pathological examination reveals myofibrillar necrosis.	0.5016158615587315
Cardiac complications are explained with overactivity of the sympathetic innervation and high levels of circulating catecholamines.	0.9206550414620569
For adequate treatment, close cardiac monitoring is required in all patients with acute cerebral lesions.	1.3199715959345266
Benign, non-parasitic liver cysts are usually asymptomatic and found incidentally by abdominal ultrasound or CT scan.	0.9100109217856178
We present the case of a 68-year-old patient who showed obstructive jaundice due to a hemorrhagic liver cyst compressing the choledochal duct.	0.9465880262863143
Due to the location of the cyst in the porta hepatis with partial compression of central liver vessels and the meanwhile organized hematoma, operative therapy was preferred in order to prevent secondary complications such as portal vein thrombosis and to exclude a malignant neoplasm.	1.121774693505836
This review summarizes briefly pathophysiology, clinical definitions, pathogenesis, risk factors, diagnostic procedures and principles of therapy and prophylaxis of ischemic stroke.	1.0009031265728285
Ischemic stroke is defined as a localized lack of cerebral perfusion mainly due to cardioembolic or arterial-embolic occlusion of cerebral arteries or hemodynamic or microangiographic reduction of cerebral blood flow.	0.9239565030801473
We focused on pathophysiological mechanisms with potential clinical relevance as the role of oxygen and glucose concentration, the therapeutic time window, the role of excitatory neurotransmitters, Ca2+-influx, free radicals, and the development of ischemic brain edema.	1.1310550444527103
Based on this data the need of an urgent initiation of diagnostic workup and therapy is emphasized.	1.0646475473660375
This includes the early basic management with monitoring of blood pressure, ECG, oxygen and blood glucose concentration, and the balance of the water and electrolyte supply.	1.12024906980768
Since specific therapeutic and prophylactic interventions are based on an exact diagnosis with respect to the pathogenesis, the need of an urgent diagnostic workup including clinical examination, laboratory baseline, vascular ultrasound, cranial CT-scan, ECG, and echocardiography is emphazised.	1.1952720551722462
Based on these results appropriate management of certain pathogenetic stroke subgroups is discussed.	0.860308632085068
New data about the effectiveness of basic care, treatment of edema, neuroprotective agents, and thrombolysis is presented.	0.9888160154767585
Indications for the therapy with intravenous heparin, vitamin K-antagonists, antiplatelet drugs, and surgical procedures are summarized.	1.208806122457649
Longitudinal osteocutaneous defects of the sternal region including the caudal third were reconstructed in 15 patients during a 3-year period by using the "vertical (VRAM)- and transverse rectus abdominis muscle" (TRAM) flap.	1.0859698903144102
The majority of the defects resulted from chronic osteomyelitis after previous cardiothoracic surgery or were due to former therapy of breast cancer.	0.9812975297768449
Three VRAM/TRAM flaps were primarily transferred as free flaps with microvascular anastomosis in the axilla region.	0.803939579850773
Nine out of 12 pedicled VRAM or TRAM flaps required an additional microvascular anastomosis because of imminent venous or arterial insufficency ("supercharging").	0.9537176289951262
Therefore, operative technique and operating time of the pedicled and free flap for reconstruction of longitudinal sternal defects are comparable.	1.2673787505742258
Adequate reconstruction and rehabilitation was achieved in 11 cases.	0.9447917464654709
In 2 patients revision and partial secondary defect coverage was required.	0.8206155683645181
Two male patients died postoperatively due to their preexisting condition.	0.8972403812126256
The introduction of joints in unilateral fixators enables these for multiple deformity corrections.	0.7420131404715373
Lengthening and shortening is achieved by changing the length of the fixator telescope.	0.8499242401458081
Axial corrections are performed by additive or subtractive techniques using uniplanar joints or by angulation procedures.	0.8071001458812858
Translation is done by direct movements of the bone fragments or by metaphyseal "double angulation".	1.057570304866456
Derotation preferably is done as an acute procedure or in the "ring part" of a hybrid frame.	1.2012592427337074
Unilateral fixators are used to correct and temporarily stabilize until the correction is held by the nintramedullary nail.	0.8824283815337801
Pathomorphology in the preterm infant represents an interaction of morphological organ immaturity and neonatal management with their respective sequelae.	0.88245967767404
Background: Morphological changes in the corneal surface after PRK may result not only in refraction fluctuations and reduction in visual acuity, but also in changes of contrast sensitivity.	1.2113266122333868
The aim of this study was to investigate whether PRK has an influence on contrast sensitivity with and without glare with a subsequent effect on the ability to drive cars.	0.9576990516574087
Calcifying obliterative atherosclerosis isolated within the descending thoracic aorta causing subtotal vascular occlusion was associated with symptoms such as in aortic coarctation in a 56-year-old patient.	0.8704953676586251
Remarkable in this unique case is the atypical and isolated manifestation of atherosclerotic disease within the thoracic aorta, as well as the tumorous extent of luminal calcification.	1.047156234044975
Differential diagnostic considerations had to include calcifying tumor of the aorta, remnants after aortitis or secondary calcified aortic dissection.	0.9465311334758577
The osteoplastic frontal sinus surgery with obliteration of the sinus has been established in the therapy of frontal sinus diseases that can not be drainaged permanently or healed through an endonasal access.	0.9645105198596213
The obliteration of the frontal sinus is endangered in cases of multiple fracturing of the posterior frontal sinus wall or if it has been destroyed by an inflammatory process.	1.0569759529857043
In these problematic cases obliteration bears the danger of complications and cranialization of the frontal sinus is therefore the method of choice.	0.9110916367494718
We review 8 patients who were operated on using the cranialization technique.	0.8488074510738023
Indications for surgery were a combined fracture of the anterior and posterior frontal sinus wall (3), a pyocele of the front sinus with extensive destruction of the posterior wall (4) and a large osteoma of the posterior frontal sinus wall (1).	1.1097564799980972
The frontal sinus was exposed through a coronal incision, the mucosa and the posterior wall were completely removed and the frontal sinus obliterated with fat tissue.	1.164317342388144
The anterior sinus wall was replaced after obliteration of the sinus or reconstructed with calvarian bone transplants.	0.8591759718035096
The follow up period was 1.8 years (11 months to 8 years).	1.1811063605613707
All patients underwent postoperatively a clinical ENT-examination and radiological assessment by CT-scan or MRI.	1.115457529392547
The overall functional and esthetic outcome was excellent.	0.7036894381831043
There were no serious complications nor any recurrence.	1.022983286585427
The cranialization of the frontal sinus is a reliable and safe variation of the classical osteoplastic frontal sinus surgery with fat obliteration.	0.9812460687989519
We present the case of an infant with Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome, in whom keloids developed at the sites of intracutanous bleeding within 6 months after the illness.	1.086589865403989
Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) belongs to the category of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA).	0.8517207041997361
The clinical picture is characterised by progressive ataxia and macular degeneration.	0.7714284709143083
Other common signs are slow saccades, external ophthalmoplegia, and pyramidal tract signs.	0.9723352234976109
The disease is caused by the expansion of an unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat in the gene for ataxin 7 on chromosome 3.	0.9493015577999364
SCA7 is a rare disorder.	1.0648606424063718
The first case in Germany was described only recently.	1.1375929542590089
We report two additional patients, father and son, with the molecular genetic diagnosis of SCA7.	1.2599116185511665
The father carries a trinucleotide expansion of 42 CAG repeats, the son 51.	0.8422553206914324
Normal alleles range from 7 to 35 CAG repeats.	0.7703287622005358
Both patients show the typical picture with progressive ataxia and macular degeneration.	0.7726866669242644
We found a pronounced anticipation (earlier disease onset in subsequent generations), which is highly characteristic of CAG repeat disorders.	1.1684408900751884
In the following contribution the under-proportional participation rate of older workers in vocational training is analysized.	0.9050896805763969
Regarding the changes concerning the organiszation of vocational training to more job-integrated, self-directed and computerbased learning the consequences for training opportunities, motivation to learn and performance possibilities as well as institutional basic conditions to optimize the participation of elderly workers in further training are discussed.	0.9132191826746641
Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is the most severe arbovirus disease transmitted by ticks.	1.0727303864487228
The mortality of the central European form is 0.7-2%.	1.3515837334754093
Active immunisation is recommended for endemic regions.	0.7831923210008152
We report on 4 patients with TBE aquired in Middle-Hessen between 1994 and 1997 (2 in 1997).	1.3107422660240513
After repeated CSF and serum testing the TBE-specific antibodies were found in all 4 cases.	0.9691321193057417
In one case there was also evidence for a prior infection with borrelia burgdorferi.	1.0603957029001259
The results of the initial CSF-analysis were atypical in 2 cases (high cell count of 136 cells/mm3, total protein up to 1.5 g/l).	1.2112412591107056
The endemic region for TBE has expanded in northern direction into Middle-Hessen, a region in which Lyme borreliosis is also endemic.	0.9277831346782823
Thus, true double infections are possible.	1.0453609284065999
This and the initially frequently atypical CSF-findings make the differential diagnosis difficult.	0.9820668370292455
Therefore, repetitive CSF and blood examinations are recommended.	1.2596226212872115
Nedocromil sodium and cromolyn sodium are non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of asthma.	1.0234574678770016
Although they are chemically different, there are many similarities in their mechanism of action.	1.1663465951869574
In provocation tests they have equal efficacy on some tests (allergen, exercise), but nedocromil sodium has greater effect on neuronal mechanisms such as So2 challenge.	0.9848742507078946
Very few studies compared the two drugs.	0.8399450420820151
In children, only one study was done, showing that twice daily nedocromil is as effective as four times daily cromolyn sodium.	1.0018364277579652
Thus twice daily administration is one advantage of nedocromil, the other being proven effect of steroid- sparing, which has not been shown with cromolyn sodium.	1.1467762550587413
Both drugs are recommended as first-line agents in mild persistent asthma.	0.9597022314744849
Background: We evaluated in this retrospective study the impact of our diagnostic and therapeutic regimens - as illustrated by typical clinical pictures - on the frequency and prognostic values of postkeratoplasty complications in herpes eyes.	1.3217282860900663
The evaluation of brain tumor recurrence and therapy-induced benign changes following surgery and/or irradiation is a diagnostic challenge for imaging methods based on either morphology (cCT/MRI) or function (SPECT/PET).	1.122977110710563
Current literature and the present data of our own patients demonstrate the diagnostic efficiency of IMT-SPECT and FDG-PET in the detection of recurrence and in-vivo grading.	0.9961656576542328
Thirty-nine patients suspected of brain tumor recurrence at follow-up were studied by FDG-PET and IMT-SPECT.	1.066331791282794
Thirty-four of 39 patients showed recurrences; in 12 cases even a change in the grade of malignancy was observed.	1.0066095785394071
All high-grade recurrences could be confirmed by either methods.	0.9913765411938064
IMT-SPECT showed a higher sensitivity in detecting low-grade tumors at recurrence.	1.0112994853951056
In contrast to IMT-SPECT, FDG-PET supports sufficient in-vivo grading.	0.9357918387607607
Both methods can be used to differentiate between tumor recurrence and radionecrosis.	0.9731472227696363
In conclusion the results of our study demonstrate the efficiency of IMT-SPECT and FDG-PET in confirming recurrences and determining the actual tumor grade.	1.012915096874788
A 22-year-old male presented with a submandibular cystic mass in the ENT Clinic of Berlin-Buch.	1.1541833450907648
Histopathology revealed a dystopic papillary carcinoma in a thyroglossal duct cyst.	0.7573413660890038
Worldwide only about 150 cases are known.	0.7155302792160636
We describe our diagnostic and therapeutic procedures employed and included tumor excision, bilateral neck dissections and total thyroidectomy.	1.0003485036207378
No abnormalities in the thyroid gland but a metastatic carcinoma was uncovered in an ipsilateral lymph node in the jugular foramen area.	0.963233134474173
A preoperative 99 Tc-thyroid scan and MRI study had not shown any evidence for a malignant tumor.	0.8925000473872824
The therapeutic approach advocated in literature is controversial but the intraoperative findings in our patient supported our decision to choose a relatively radical but not mutilating therapy.	1.0234251266518866
Transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-1) is a pleiotrophic growth factor in carcinogenesis and regulars multiple cell functions.	1.0171020621304192
We wanted to evaluate the diagnostic meaning of TGF-1 plasma levels in patients with a biopsy proven prostate cancer.	1.095761153328577
The TGF-1 blood level was analysed in 394 patients.	0.8252788916477689
In 242 patients (group I) the blood was taken before any prostate manipulation and biopsy.	1.1288812963683672
The TGF-1 plasma concentrations were almost similar in the group of patients with a prostate cancer (n = 157) and patients with a benign prostate hyperplasia (n = 85; 14 258 pg/ml versus 14 658 pg/ml, SD 10 516 pg/ml).	1.194617231902512
In 152 patients the blood was taken 6-12 months after radical prostatectomy (group II).	1.031190856887165
There was no significant difference between the patients with a PSA-progress and without PSA-progress after.	1.077332187788159
Our results suggest that TGF-1 plasma levels can not be used to distinguish between patients with prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia.	1.0502535582891164
The aim of this study was to compare the psychological stress of patients with different forms of immediate type hypersensitivity and urticaria.	0.962247197636657
Moreover, the patients' motivation for different forms of psychological treatment was assessed and an indication for psychosocial support was defined.	1.2268211561622941
228 consecutive inpatients with insect venom allergies (ins), food intolerance (food), drug hypersensitivities (dru) and urticaria (urt) were evaluated by validated questionnaires regarding psychological strain and motivation for psychosocial treatments.	1.2459263892032981
Patients with food intolerance and urticaria showed significantly elevated psychological stress and higher motivation for psychosocial support as compared to those with insect venom allergies and drug intolerance.	0.9835078129983358
Patient education was the favourite technique for the patients (food 78%, urt 57%, dru 24%, ins 17%), followed by relaxation treatment.	1.300783472675293
The most important predictors for the motivation were the wish for self-responsibility, a feeling of helplessness and social limitations.	0.9782853261004508
If strong indication criteria are applied, psychosocial support is indicated in only small subgroups of each patient group.	1.0185882078805732
In spite of that, the management of allergic disease should consider the potential need for psychosocial support.	1.0931870747247363
The definition of endocrine disrupters is not very sharp.	0.8253377162707247
At present all non-physiologic substances which bind to steroid receptors, are defined as endocrine disrupters of which the best studied are estrogenic in nature.	0.9121685941076629
Many pesticides or insecticides or their metabolites have estrogenic activity and pollute our surface water.	0.706348819344238
Here they may cause severe estrogenization of aquatic life.	0.7837208243490296
Only traces of these substances are demonstrable in drinking water.	0.8226019109123129
On the other hand, weak estrogens present in plastic ware may be ingested by men and therefore be potentially harmful for human health.	0.8069607437980874
On the other hand, many plants produce socalled'hyto-estrogens', particularly soy products are rich in phyto-estrogens but their high consumption in Asian populations are most likely the reason for reduced occurrence of breast cancer.	0.9477229427178792
Many plant extracts used for human medication also contain phyto-estrogens and are beneficial in the treatment of climacteric complaints.	0.8457874706708194
Hence, not all endocrine disruptors must be harmful to human health, in fact, some of them (clearly phyto-estrogens) may have beneficial effects.	1.1270569600801685
Germany's new Protection against infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz) will take effect on January 1, 2001.	0.9099606475346192
It will result in an increase of notifications on reportable infections.	0.815234873809299
Counties and states have to adjust the infrastructure of their reportable disease notification systems to meet the demands of the new legislation.	0.9014726197668451
An increased demand for human resources at the non-medical staff level is anticipated.	0.9003824918947514
Continuing education programs for medical and non-medical staff at public health offices are mandatory.	0.8516724685992848
Physicians in private practice, hospitals and diagnostic laboratories and leaders of nursing homes are target groups for special information.	0.8428101164550882
A timely review and epidemiological evaluation of all notifications forwarded by county health offices has to be performed at the state level.This is a prerogative for immediate response in case of non-localized increases in reported disease incidence.	1.0790835401633874
The author advocates the development of an epidemiological rapid reaction scheme (epidemiological fire brigade) in which public health physicians at the county, state, and federal level cooperate in a gradual response to outbreak situations according to actual demand.	1.1080224953110156
We report on an 8 year old boy and a 12 year old girl with intermittent peranal loss of blood and mucus, impaired defecation and recurrent abdominal pain.	1.2152352461824714
On endoscopy isolated ulcers were seen in the rectum only, whereas the colonic mucosa appeared to be normal macroscopically and microscopically.	1.0052672292814249
Biopsies from the borders of the ulcers revealed a hyperplasia of the lamina muscularis mucosae and a fibromuscular obliteration of the lamina propria mucosae.	0.9338445539368297
These clinical, endoscopical and histological findings are characteristic for the solitary rectal ulcer syndrome.	0.8752109828933284
Only 26 paediatric cases (age at diagnosis 6-9 years) have been published so far.	1.2297945879876189
The interval from first symptoms to final diagnosis (mean: 3,7 years, range: 1 week to 9 years) is remarkably long in childhood cases.	1.3187585748087507
Pathogenetically an internal rectal prolapse with secondary ischemic lesions is assumed.	0.7487176223620681
There is no evidence of an association to inflammatory bowel disease.	1.036674570593877
The ulcers ars often resistant to different medical and surgical options.	0.8061325418295705
Discussion: Pediatricians should be aware of the solitary rectal ulcer syndrome in order to make an earlier diagnosis and to prevent unnecessary diagnostic procedures and concerns of patients and their parents about more severe illnesses.	1.1422215196569734
A typology of chronic illness in childhood and adolescence is developed.	0.8205672784996572
In a comparative analysis of 29 studies, maximal androgen deprivation (MAD) was not found to be superior to partial androgen deprivation.	1.1162850011236036
Thus, MAD cannot be regarded as the new gold standard.	1.1868181682331949
Most trials focus on quality of life which - given the palliative aim of the treatment - deserves special attention.	1.3932334849810368
This aspect has not yet been evaluated, however, in the largest multicenter study, Intergroup study 0105.	1.1660123595155096
In patients with advanced bone metastasis or severe pain, MAD treatment should be begun because of the flare phenomenon.	1.0512020526532986
The synergistic effects of LHRH agonists on the prostate are currently being investigated.	0.787379710050905
Since no clear prognostic factors exist and reduction of serum-PSA levels under MAD does not delay progression, the patient must help to make the decision of whether or not MAD should be begun.	1.0740248500744471
A case of generalized maculopapular rash and local indurated plaques following s.c. injections of either low-molecular-weight heparin or conventional (high-molecular-weight) heparin to a 75-year-old woman is reported.	1.0094527366482788
This rare reaction is described and the literature to date is reviewed.	1.2143266719051842
Perioperative morbidity and mortality in noncardiac surgery are mainly due to cardiovascular complications.	0.7886278042782279
Therefore, perioperative risk assessment is crucial to avoid these adverse events.	1.3333181534897602
In patients above the age of 40 years, the ECG is a basic investigation, often providing hints for cardiovascular diseases.	1.1855836546600618
Stress testing and, in special cases, stress echocardiography or scintigraphy (the latter only in those patients, in which exercise is impossible) can detect significant coronary artery disease.	1.2544492761583406
The vascularization reduced the perioperative risk in particular in those patients with unstable angina or severe coronary artery disease.	1.0833092670421267
However, prophylactic revascularization the stable patient does not improve overall outcome, because the risk of the revascularizing procedure must be added to the risk of noncardiac surgery.	1.1757843558854388
Other diagnostic procedures like echocardiography, chest roentgenogram, routine scintigraphy, halter ECG or halter blood pressure measurement do not add information to the perioperative risk assessment, although these techniques might be very relevant in evaluating other coexisting diseases (heart failure; valve lesions, in particular aortic stenoses etc.)	1.100864585018141
and can be useful to improve medical treatment preoperatively (e.g.	0.715388756201578
normalization of blood pressure).	0.7309937572073341
A verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder (pT4N0M0, G1) developed in a 66-year-old woman who had been suffering from interstitial cystitis with Hunner's ulcer for 10 years.	0.9276016153738548
Up to now, only 7 cases of verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder unassociated with bilharzial cystitis have been reported.	0.999049079796424
Although the development of a verrucous carcinoma as a complication of interstitial cystitis has not been reported so far, the authors regard the chronic irritation of the bladder to be the most important etiologic factor for the malignant transformation.	1.2150177503719384
After conservative management had failed, a radical cystectomy with supravesical urinary diversion was performed.	0.8709628488239755
The characteristics of interstitial cystitis, verrucous carcinoma and surgical management are discussed.	0.8119315652956097
Introduction: Abdominal actinomycosis is an uncommon disease.	1.3405944884769894
Nevertheless it should be considered in case of unclear tumor-like abdominal masses.	1.1441081035818186
Methods: We report a case of a 49-year-old patient with an intrauterine device.	1.2650058474478283
The patient was submitted with a solid and painful tumor in the upper abdomen.	1.089359329340824
After sonography, computerized tomography, gastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy the preoperative presumptive diagnosis was a carcinoma of the transvers colon invading the abdominal wall.	0.8844821096000289
Pathological examination after a right hemicolectomy surprisingly revealed an actinomycosis.	0.7766576000006549
Results: Based on this case diagnostic tools and therapeutic options of actinomycosis of the colon are discussed.	1.3093202203346672
Conclusions: This case illustrates the importance to consider the possibility of actinomycosis when finding an unclear abdominal mass.	1.0873878331228597
After a surgical excision an abdominal actinomycosis requires antibiotic therapy.	0.7502420802878813
Long-term treatment of patients with chronic schizophrenias requires integration of many therapeutic approaches, co-operation of several professions, and regard for the views of patients and relatives.	1.1812450048452052
This review deals with practical aspects of pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, cognitive resp.	0.9009808470077862
psychological treatments, social resp.	0.8813806232171225

Continuous neuroleptic treatment is indispensable in most cases to achieve social integration.	0.940513147968858
Indications for adding on antidepressants, lithium, carbamazepine, benzodiazepines and other drugs are discussed, as well as treatment of negative symptoms, depression and management of treatment-resistant symptoms.	0.9756049041174205
Psychotherapy needs to regard the possibilities of the patient.	0.8723328776421109
In the context of a stable long-term relationship, the patient is supported in experiencing himself as a subject capable of action.	1.2511667476485682
Effectiveness of cognitive treatments to date is limited.	0.7745963397738334
The best results are achieved by social skills training.	0.869577444919908
Social therapy, which aims at the improvement of functional aspects of the patient, is of paramount importance.	1.194074049303598
Improved possibilities for work rehabilitation are contrasted by difficulties in financing long-term social rehabilitation.	0.8861018061132658
Interventions based on the EE concept are highly effective, but are rarely used.	1.0419455579764156
Programs that merely convey information without targeting behaviour modification are ineffective.	0.6388557650661523
The functions of facilities of treatment in the community are explained, the integrative role of case-management is stressed.	1.1636239605062664
The effect of a locally applied peppermint oil preparation on tension-type headache was examined in the design of a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind crossover study for the first time.	0.9102257581468367
The preparation was tested against both the reference substance acetaminophen and to the corresponding placebo.	1.088881972221992
The liquid test preparation contained 10 g of peppermint oil and ethanol (90 %) ad 100 (test preparation LI 170, Lichtwer Pharma, Berlin); the placebo was a 90 % ethanol solution to which traces of peppermint oil were added for blinding purposes.	1.0883058950902866
The reference preparation contained 500 mg acetaminophen; the placebo tablet was identical to the verum in size and appearance.	0.9196793817722679
The study included the analysis of 164 headache attacks of 41 patients of both sexes ranging between 18 and 65 years of age, suffering from tension-type headache in accordance with the IHS classification.	1.0432943152639214
Four headache episodes per patient were treated in a double-blind, randomized crossover design.	0.8738658383099036
Each headache attack was treated by the application of 2 capsules of the oral medication (1000 mg of acetaminophen or placebo) and the cutaneous application of the oil preparation (peppermint oil or placebo solution).	1.1895347275248314
The oil was spread largely across forehead and temples which was repeated after 15 and 30 minutes.	0.8283306113516702
Using a headache diary, the headache parameters were assessed after 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes.	1.1240065358385856
Compared to the application of placebo, a 10 % peppermint oil in ethanol solution significantly reduced the clinical headache intensity already after 15 minutes (p < 0.01).	0.8894966452575817
This significant clinical reduction of the pain intensity continued over the one hour observation period.	0.9929511378606222
Acetaminophen, too, proved to be efficient compared to placebo (p < 0.01).	0.7908899828288356
There was no significant difference between the efficacy of 1000 mg of acetaminophen and 10 % peppermint oil in ethanol solution.	0.7521561661549979
Simultaneous application of 1000 mg of acetaminophen and 10 % peppermint oil in ethanol solution leads to an additive effect which remains below the significance threshold, however.	0.9094508268094967
The patients reported no adverse events.	0.7176840969615383
This controlled study showed for the first time that a 10 % peppermint oil in ethanol solution efficiently alleviates tension-type headache.	0.980989606582503
Peppermint oil thus proves to be a well-tolerated and cost-effective alternative to usual therapies.	0.9947841996028339
The positive results of several multi-center studies significantly improved the immunomodulatory treatment of multiple sclerosis over the last few years.	0.9933043407980774
It was demonstrated that different compounds are capable to reduce the number of relapses and to modulate the progression of disease.	0.8999833405906876
To improve the transition of results obtained in these studies into daily clinical practice, a consensus group started to prepare a report on the current treatment options for the German-speaking European countries.	1.217567554479206
The aim of this paper is to summarize the current knowledge, compare the results of recent clinical trials with the experience from other  therapeutic options and assess their clinical evidence.	1.2608037432318433
Dislocated metacarpal V fractures, fixed by percutaneous Kirschner wires or other implants near the metacarpophalangeal joint, often show impaired movement despite excellent radiologic findings.	0.9018664725039085
We therefore chose an alternative method using intramedullary Kirschner wire osteosynthesis according to Foucher.	0.7768881852967101
Twenty-five patients were operated on in a 3-year period and movement of the fingers and complications were examined.	1.1115924382931446
Six weeks after operation all fractures were consolidated in anatomical reduction.	0.9935944538368702
One patient suffering from an early stage of Sudeck's dystrophy was healed, and no other complications appeared.	1.1404419114356605
Three months after treatment all patients achieved free movement of the fingers with anatomical alignment.	1.0797774988714335
We therefore recommend intramedullary Kirschner wire osteosynthesis in distal metacarpal V fractures.	0.7832500847622208
Aspiration of toxic substances, foreign material, bacterially contaminated secretions, or water (near-drowning) either immediately leads to cessation of respiration or to impaired ventilation due to airway obstruction, it causes hypoxia due to surfactant dysfunction, and pulmonary infection might develop.	1.0159650335991643
Respiratory insufficiency is the resulting consequence which needs immediate and appropriate therapy and intervention.	0.8333406645613102
The knowledge of risk factors that promote aspiration injury is important for its prevention and limitation.	1.0270536806922754
Mortality varies between 3 and 70% depending on patients studied, and on the nature and amount of aspirated material.	1.022109205699117
The major cause of death is acute respiratory failure.	0.7629715142600262
The onset of injury to the lung after aspiration is very rapid.	0.8942827173056958
Therefore, therapeutic interventions like bronchoscopy are often too late.	1.2258823829026906
More importantly, oxygenation should be monitored continuously for timely institution of mechanical ventilation.	0.852358100694081
Antibiotics should not be given routinely but a calculated regime is neccessary when signs of infection develop.	0.9239247523796238
Prognosis in near-drowning considerably depends on early rescue and successful resuscitation.	0.7768246784391507
A rapid onset of cerebral hypothermia during the accident can help to increase the ischemic tolerance of the brain and makes it neccessary to continue advanced life support until rewarming of the near-drowning victim.	1.0275134374933848
Anticipation of individual outcome in unconscious patients is difficult.	0.834884385603322

The overall mortality of near-drowning is about 11%.	0.8339722905608793
Pathophysiological aspects, diagnostic procedures, pratical management and possible prophylaxis of aspiration injuries will be discussed.	0.8993429669696763
Background: Semiquantitative classification of corneal topography after penetrating keratoplasty has the potential for focusing information about the areal dioptric power of the cornea.	1.1386806578098367
The purpose of this study was to objectify the procedure of manual semiquantitative classification using a Fourier transform of corneal topography power data and to correlate both methods.	0.9655931336864603
Recently, professional anaesthesiologists organizations, have set up recommendations for intraoperative monitoring.	1.1941774299710497
These recommendations are based upon the assumption that anaesthesia-related deaths are largely preventable and that extensive monitoring will reduce mortality.	0.9166274104570986
Hypoxaemia appears to be an important pathophysiological mechanism, and this is why oxygen monitoring is given a high priority in safety standards in anaesthesia.	1.1403928492675373
However, no reduction in mortality has been definitively shown to follow the use of any monitoring device in randomized, controlled trials.	1.2983953915257194
Four techniques of oxygen monitoring are discussed and evaluated.	0.9383375414312505
Oxygen monitoring during inspiration can be recommended, although its implementation will probably prevent only a few anaesthesia-related deaths.	1.1108891235558933
Pulse oximetry is certainly highly recommended, but also has some deficiencies which are not sufficiently well known considering the popularity of this technique.	1.1838464239777697
Transcutaneous PO2 is considered mainly for historical reasons.	0.6605710134177967
Near infrared spectrometry is a new technique offering noninvasive and continuous monitoring of intracerebral oxygenation.	1.0360721008406524
The increasing frequency of stent implantation into coronary arteries is based mainly on assumptions.	0.9291784257681495
One of these assumptions is that stents may prevent restenosis.	0.9145965772630937
Stents can prevent restenosis as has been shown in two randomized studies (Stress I and Benestent I), but only in large (> 3.0mm) vessels with short denovo lesions.	1.2353894510064733
Despite the very tight selection of patients suitable for stent implantation in these two studies, the advantage for stents remained small (about 10% less restenosis) and appeared to decrease with time following intervention.	1.12232369581853
There is increasing concern about the extension of stenting in an "unrestricted strategy".	0.9128882405919517
This concern was expressed in the ACC Expert Consensus Document which was published recently (JACC 28, No 3, September 1996: 782-794.	0.9733165432566651
Based on the lack of data for most of the presently used stent indications the expert group recommended a more selective strategy for the implantation of stents into coronary arteries.	1.0279025137147557
Removal of the arterial sheath immediately after PTCA is desirable for patients, reduces the medical staff's workload, and may decrease hospital costs due to a shortened length of stay.	1.1374629149322382
Although the safety and efficacy of the hemostatic systems used especially for the above purpose have been sufficiently documented, inadvertent intraluminal vascular occlusion is theoretically possible.	0.9261817959006623
While partial or complete arterial occlusion in conjunction with the VasoSeal collagen prototype device has been previously reported, similar complications occurring with the Angio-SealTM device were not published.	0.9414838099856455
In this report, we describe a 54-year old female patient (height: 150 cm, weight: 42.5 kg) who was transferred for PTCA following an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction.	1.1709524718948527
Immediately after PTCA, the Angio-SealTM device was deployed utilizing standard technique.	0.8670555954717811
No difficulties were encountered during device deployment, however, immediately following device placement active arterial bleeding occurred.	1.002703502817894
Due to the inadequacy of hemostasis, heparin was reversed with protamine to avoid further hemorrhagic complications.	0.835661672931363
Following this, the desired hemostasis quickly occurred, but the patient soon complained about symptoms suggestive of an acute occlusion of the right femoral artery.	1.2704674032842125
Unsatisfactory attempts as lysis resulted in the patient being transferred to vascular surgery.	0.9562950221078823
The complete Angio-SealTM system (anchor including collagen) was located intravasculary, and removed during surgery.	1.0264943604365484
Deviations in the axes can be physiological or pathological.	0.7361924369415269
During growth, the axes of the lower extremities undergo significant changes.	1.0521289084535204
The femoral neck-shaft-angle decreases from 150 ° on average at birth to 120 ° on average at the end of growth.	1.0518280058865654
The lower leg is bowed in a varus direction at birth.	0.8608546512010365
On the basis of an extensive literature search (DIMDI, MEDLINE - status at June 1992), the causes of contact urticaria so far known are displayed in tables.	1.107699671181472
The contact urticariogens can be divided into (1) chemically defined substances and (2) chemically undefined biological materials.	1.0278726375018887
The causes most frequently encountered in 16 professions are given.	0.8039413404655431
Numerous agents are known for medical professions (physicians, nurses, dentists and dental technicians, veterinary surgeons).	0.8367845456025811
Today, the most frequent single cause of contact urticaria is probably the presence of latex proteins in rubber (gloves, condoms, tubes, balloons, etc.).	0.9881634335957695
When testing is performed a stepwise approach is recommended for safety reasons (rub test, prick test, scratch chamber test).	0.8991107472774221
For some contact urticariogens a commercial radioallergosorbent test (RAST) is available.	0.8522542953771174
In the cases reported in the literature it is not always possible to decide definitely whether the pathogenetic mechanism was immunologic (IgE mediated) or non-immunologic (toxic or pseudoallergic).	1.0419916811824521
When there is a high degree of sensitization (e.g.	0.7685644684374034
to latex) professional activities must be severely restricted, or even completely discontinued in rare cases.	0.9566981857626203
Purpose: To find and describe potential MRI criteria of nutrient vessel canals of carpal bones.	0.8773994206579725
2-Agonists are being used increasingly in anaesthesia and intensive care medicine because of their antihypertensive, analgesic and sedative properties.	1.0695994601926977
Platelets bear 2-receptors on the cell surface.	0.8171896433984724
Stimulation of these receptors by agonists induces platelet aggregation.	0.8225062050025167
The present study examined whether in vitro incubation of blood with the 2-agonists clonidine and dexmedetomidine decreases 2-receptor density and hereby influences platelet aggregation.	1.1069917936770717
Prehospital diagnosis and first line therapy of acute chest pain are among the most frequently encountered challenges for general practitioners and emergency physicians.	1.102029574025557
Acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndromes in general are present in about a third of patients complaining of acute chest pain.	0.980797708399465
The basis of first line therapy is the understanding of the pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia, the clinical symptoms, the diagnostic tools and the preclinically available therapeutic options.	1.293325410687141
Time is the most critical factor in myocardial ischemia and subsequent infarction with irreversible injury of subendocardial cells starting within 30-60 minutes of total myocardial ischemia and with transmural infarction becoming complete in 3 to 6 hours.	1.0792771244516017
With 30% of patients dying within the first hour of ischemia mostly due to ventricular arrhyhtmias every effort needs to be made to shorten the delay between symptom onset and start of reperfusion therapy.	1.1121193185845142
The present overview concentrates on the armamentarium of preclincial diagnosis and the options of first line therapy of myocardial infarction with the aim of a short transport time to the hospital and therefore a short delay to more specific therapies like thrombolysis or PTCA.	1.1993264554801901
The aim of surgical intervention in the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is the achievement of normocalcemia and euparathyreosis.	1.2556217774414709
Despite improved diagnostic procedures containing comparatively modified pre- and intraoperative methods to determine the position of the parathyroid glands and the most efficient operative technique including minimal-invasive surgery thereof, success cannot be guaranteed.	1.0252629126157118
Therefore, we should strive to avoid reintervention by ensuring a hemorrhage-free, atraumatic, anatomical-orientated operation and providing positive preconditions for reoperation.	1.0948551442206158
Success is based on the four pillars of the HPT surgery: history, embryology with anatomy, neck surgery and experience.	0.8732890297194917
By means of this principle and the results of surgical treatment in 1634 patients with pHPT from 1982 until 1998, we demonstrate a standardized operative technique of pHPT.	1.1056804666549442
A 67-year-old male patient presented with a nephrotic syndrome.	0.8515021272177925
Biopsy of the kidney revealed the characteristic of fibrillary glo-merulopathy on light and electron micros-copy.	0.8768039219437135
Other non-nephritic causes of a nephrotic syndrome (e.g.	0.5617202637809215
amyloidosis, immunotactoid glomerulopathy, light-chain glomerulopathy, cryoglobulinaemia, collagen-III glomerulopathy, fibronectin glomerulopathy) could be excluded.	0.9066156548225113
Besides the case report, differential diagnosis of fibrillary glomerulopathies is presented.	1.0761662610196097
Two patients were infected with sporotrichosis; one had the fixed cutaneous form, the other the lymphocutaneous form.	1.1394825621144107
Sporotrichosis schenckii was identified in both with a culture from a tissue biopsy.	0.8665123092189729
Both patients were successfully treated with itraconazole, one received 100 mg and the other 200 mg itraconazole daily over a 3 months period.	1.1404221130742374
Abstract   Mitoxantrone is an anthracenedione antineoplastic agent that has recently been shown to be effective in ameliorating disease activity in multiple sclerosis (MS) as indicated by clinical and MRI data.	1.032673296832891
However, the role of mitoxantrone in escalating treatment of patients with frequent and severe relapses and with rapid progression of disability is less clear.	0.9737191917874052
In this retrospective analysis we report on 15 patients with severe relapsing-remitting (9 patients) and secondary progressive MS with superimposed exacerbations (6 patients) treated openlabeled with mitoxantrone in our Clinical Research Group from July 1994 to October 1998.	1.3451705269810805
Eleven of these patients (73%) were treated with azathioprine, interferon-beta-1b or cyclophosphamide before.	1.0673319054857784
The patients received mitoxantrone over a period of at least 12 months (19 +/- 6 months) with a single dose of 10 mg/m2 monthly for the first three months.	1.3642061385018178
Thereafter, infusions were repeated every 3 months (total dose 141 mg +/- 45 mg).	0.9461815964757228
The annual relapse rate could be significantly reduced from 3,0 +/- 1,5 in the year before therapy to 0,5 +/- 0,5 during therapy.	1.1231333871430758
Nine patients (60%) were stabilised, while four patients (27%) showed an improvement of disability.	1.3904784778413022
The treatment was well tolerated with only minor side effects.	0.7966579301736548
These results although retrospectively obtained confirm previous trials showing that mitoxantrone may be useful in MS patients with frequent and severe exacerbations and/or a rapidly progressive course of the disease who have had other immunomodulatory medication.	1.0637002166265803
Interstitial cystitis (IC) represents a rare and complex inflammatory bladder condition in which diagnostics can be challenging.	0.8947798203860328
Strict NIH criteria for its diagnosis were designed for research purposes.	0.7879468108371454
Their routine application would miss large proportions of IC patients.	0.7078997432310941
When IC is suspected, history and physical exam are followed by an evaluation of long-term voiding diaries.	1.026419013336042
Large voided volumes (functional capacity >250 cc) or longer micturition intervals (>2 h.), absence of nocturia or symptom-free periods reduce the likelihood of IC.	1.170178967727555
Further exclusion diagnostics include urine tests (infection), cytology (in-situ carcinoma), ultrasound (calculi, bulks, anomalies) and urodynamics in selected cases.	1.1731155942884546
Bladder capacity measurements under sedoanalgesia are of limited value, since functional low-volume bladders can be mechanically extendable.	0.8821523574909524
Cystoscopy under general anesthesia represents the diagnostic standard procedure for IC during which 90% of IC-patients present with characteristic mucosal glomerulations after bladder distension.	1.0485035096978688
Biopsies are recommended for exclusion of malignancy.	0.7848707115251918
Potassium-leak testing plays no relevant role in routine diagnostics due to its poor sensitivity.	0.863820144129904
Similarly, complex determinations of novel IC markers (histamine, tryptase, cytokines, growth factors, substance P, nitric oxide) are of no relevance in clinical settings and should be restricted to research projects.	1.008546007517215
According to semiotics, which may be defined as the doctrine of the essential nature and fundamental varieties of signs, objects, and interpretants, pain is considered to be a sign (significant) with very different meanings (significance) either as a naturalistic symptom (of disease) or as a symbol used in a metaphorical context.	1.1916695483689155
When following this methodological perspective it is possible to interpret medical as well as poetic writings on equal terms.	0.9484740016775947
In Graeco-Roman medical texts pain was mostly understood as a result and an indicator of disease, but nonetheless as a symptom which seemed to be actively produced by the affected body.	1.1108549034590778
Especially in the Corpus Hippocraticum dating from the 5th and 4th century B. C. this materialistic and at the same time psychosomatic attitude can be noticed.	0.9013865386356963
Aristotle (4th century B. C.), Celsus (1st century A. D.), and the famous experimental physiologist Galen (2nd century A. D.) agreed that pain was a sign of evil which should be fought without exception.	1.0148048702455337
It was Galen who added the disturbance of function (functio laesa) as the fifth cardinal sign of inflammation to the four well-known cardinal signs of Celsus (rubor, calor, tumor, dolor).	1.0220702562499446
He also coined the term µK to characterize an attack of migraine.	0.6938613178944115
In algotherapy, Galen used a complex pharmacological system which was based upon the four cardinal qualities of humoral pathology.	0.9208753294885568
On the other hand, pain was designed as a multi-dimensional symbol by the famous Graeco-Roman epic poets.	0.8933273216512023
In Homer's Odyssey (8th century B. C.), pain appears transformed into the shape of a scar which is visible and palpable on the hero's leg like an identification tag, whereas in Virgil's Aeneids (1st century B. C.) pain symbolizes weakness and defencelessness which can only be alleviated by the goddess Venus.	0.9878082446320697
In this article current indications and limitations of neuromuscular monitoring are reviewed.	1.0255274931748766
Attention is mainly focused on detection of residual curarisation.	0.718987057099963
New insights in the pathophysiological consequences of residual neuromuscular blockade and the actual criteria of complete recovery are discussed.	1.0133556246244644
Surprisingly in this context, despite the benefit of neuromuscular monitoring, its utilisation in clinical practice is rather an exception than the routine.	1.096269498019679
A lack of standardisation of neuromuscular monitoring is probably the major problem on the way to a widespread utilisation of the monitoring.	1.0169151320879242
Three patients presented with an acquired green discoloration of their scalp hair.	0.8377628368210546
History revealed that all of them swam regularly in private swimming pools.	0.7742013984513778
Examination of the hair by atomic emission spectroscopy showed that the green discoloration was caused by an excessively high copper content of the hair.	1.02819401985873
This exogeneous discoloration is characteristically related to the uptake of copper from private swimming pools.	0.7422901504696193
A 62-year-old female patient presented with bullous, intensely itching cutaneous lesions, which clinically and histopathologically resembled dermatitis herpetiformis (Duhring's disease).	0.9137878490445754
Therapy with DADPS was unsuccessful.	0.46717912039889625
Because of associated cervical lymph node enlargement and splenomegaly, a lymph node biopsy was taken.	0.9167059404095634
Histopathology of a lymph node and of the bone marrow confirmed the diagnosis: angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy (AILD)-type T-cell lymphoma.	1.0935778373341574
Intensely pruritic associated skin eruptions are typical for this peculiar kind of lymphoma.	0.6953468738016593
These skin lesions are due to inflammatory cells and not to neoplastic infiltrations.	0.8444539808694281
This case report is the first report of AILD with bullous skin lesions to appear in the literature.	1.014915685563
Background: The procedures for prophylaxis and treatment of keratopathy following facial palsy with lagophthalmos are unsatisfying from the functional point of view.	0.9413384099902022
The purpose of our study was to compare the diagnostic performance of a 0.2-T MRI unit and a 1.0-T MRI unit in the evaluation of the anterior cruciate ligament in patients with clinically suspected lesions of this ligament.	1.0556672685011532
Twenty four patients with clinically suspected lesions of the anterior cruciate ligament underwent MRI of the knee on both 0.2-T and 1.0-T MRI units.	1.1845668377466652
Three independent observers evaluated the examinations for primary and secondary signs of a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament.	0.8546858272398594
Frequency of these signs was determined for both modalities, and observer agreement was assessed using the kappa statistic.	1.0962033867549386
Sixteen of 24 patients had signs of tears of the anterior cruciate ligament on the 1.0-T unit; the 0.2-T unit detected primary signs in 15/16 (93 %) patients and secondary signs in 7/12 (43 %) patients.	1.1174139351094632
In 8 patients the 1.0 T unit showed neither primary nor secondary signs for tears of the anterior cruciate ligament; in these patients the 0.2-T unit detected primary signs in 1/8 cases (12 %), and secondary signs in 3/8 cases (37 %).	1.047510582667588
Observer agreement was very good for the 1.0-T unit and fair for the 0.2-T unit.	0.9182591293842347
There is no substantial difference between 1.0-T units and 0.2-T MRI units in the visualisation of primary signs of tears of the anterior cruciate ligament.	1.0231455711166055
In the visualisation of secondary signs, 1.0-T units are superior to 0.2-T units, and there is a surprisingly high rate of false-positive results with the 0.2-T unit.	1.220603220594193
As to the reproducibility of the results, the 1.0-T unit is far superior to the 0.2-T unit.	1.0692137159422133
Purpose of our study was to develop a reliable model to define clinical stage I nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT) being at low risk and at high risk for occult retroperitoneal metastases based on pathohistological and immunohistochemical parameters in order to stratify the therapeutic approach.	1.038506989871413
3-5 paraffin-embedded formalin fixed tissue blocks of 149 clinical stage I NSGCT were available from all patients and were analyzed for histopathological features associated with pathological stage: presence/absence of vascular invasion, presence/absence of tunical invasion, percentage of each histological cell type present in the primary tumor.	1.071402063346865
Immunohistochemical expression of MIB-1, p53, bcl-2, cathepsin D and e-cadherin was evaluated using a semiquantitative scoring ystem.	0.7689429217485919
Statistical analysis was performed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression models.	0.8938788535559139
Percentage of embryonal carcinoma [%EC (p < 0.001)] and presence of vascular invasion [VI (p < 0.0001)] were the most significant independent risk factors associated with pathological stage II disease.	1.1161694957063126
Combination of %EC and VI allowed correct prediction of final pathological stage in 88 % of patients.	1.0136264015177685
Cut-off values including both variables identified correct pathological stage in 131/149 patients (88 %).	0.8384996216653318
Less than 45 % EC and absence of VI correctly identified pathological stage I disease in 91.5 %; more than 80 % EC and presence of VI correctly predicted pathological stage II in 88 % of the patients.	1.1089150107496084
%EC and presence/absence of VI appear to be reliable prognosticators to identify both patients at high risk and at low risk for occult retroperitoneal disease.	1.0278468487389623
P53, bcl-2, MIB-1, cathepsin D and e-cadherin did not appear to be of prognostic value in clinical stage I NSGCT.	0.8024034629384235
In the framework of rheumatic illnesses, the lungs and pleura are often observed to be involved.	1.1184227431302336
Dependent on the basic illness in question, conditions of the bronchoalveolar system, vessels, lymphatic system, and pleura that have developed differently inter- and intraindividually can be diagnosed in toporegionally variable forms and combinations.	1.0855023862649509
In the causal pathogenesis, the initial (auto-)immunological alteration of the alveolar septa plays a role.	1.2186986597281206
When the monocytes, macrophages, and fibroblasts are activated, as a result of a chronic inflammatory process there is increasing reparative proliferation, which finally leads to the nonspecific end stage of irreversible interstitial fibrosis.	1.2134499940362038
The incidence and manifestation forms of lung changes show certain differences dependent on the underyling illness (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, progressive systemic scleroderma, dermatomyositis and polymyositis, Sjögren syndrome, and mixed connective tissue disease).	1.005054912871109
In addition to vasculitis and granulomatosis of the lung, therapy-induced lung changes must also be considered in the differential diagnosis since almost all basic therapeutic agents can cause this type of lung condition.	1.027389340396107
Good knowledge of the parameters from the viewpoint of possible therapeutic measures is indispensable, as is close cooperation between the treating physician and the pathologist.	1.1242756717601448
Scintigraphic imaging identifies pathophysiological processes; in other words it assesses regional perfusion, permeability, leukocytic accumulation and bone turnover.	0.8721246981498052
These processes precede morphological changes and this accounts for the high sensitivity of nuclear medicine procedures as well as the low specificity for the differential diagnosis of different diseases with similar pathophysiological characteristics.	1.182315636049844
This review (1) describes and evaluates the currently used scintigraphic procedures, (2) suggests their differential use in certain clinical settings in comparison with alternative radiological methods and (3) addresses new developments in diagnosis using nuclear medicine procedures.	1.0258619509147195
In summary, we advise dynamic bone scanning as a primary scintigraphic investigation.	1.0677855707266817
A negative scan excludes osteomyelitis in most cases.	0.6763911242837835
The comparison is made with conventional radiology and clinical history.	0.8136928049417012
In cases with short clinical histories ( = granulocytic inflammation), leukocyte scintigraphy should be the next diagnostic step; in chronic processes (lymphomonocytic inflammation), gallium scintigraphy is advisable.	1.272607835322038
Other scintigraphic methods might be of additional use in experienced hands.	0.8862121164873861
SPECT is useful for clarifying inconclusive planar scans of the head, spine and large joints.	0.9655254880747547
To assess the clinical effectiveness of glaucoma therapy with diode laser cyclophotocoagulation, 106 eyes (51 eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma, 22 eyes with secondary glaucoma, 10 eyes with narrow-angle glaucoma, 23 eyes with other glaucomas) of 87 patients were treated.	1.1012827925738644
Using a diode laser coupled with a fiberoptic probe, ending in a focusing tip, all eyes were treated with 24-30 spots over 360  ° and 2.8-3.6 J of energy, 1.5 mm posterior to the limbus.	1.2190428154378428
The intraocular pressure was obtained over a period of time until 8-24 months after operation.	1.086745993354059
Additionally, morphological changes of the ciliary body were observed in 25 eyes by means of ultrasound biomicroscopy.	1.1280179390777987
Our objective was to determine the efficacy of ESWL treatment in children and the extent of auxiliary measures.	1.0255609172614681
In a retrospective analysis we investigated number of auxiliary measures and the stone-free rate in children after ESWL treatment.	1.0058489702072797
We report a 44-year-old female patient who underwent surgery because of a suspected primary tumor of the renal pelvis in imaging procedures.	1.271838978094027
Histology revealed the diagnosis of mesoblastic nephroma.	0.7612903852623326
This tumor represents a special entity of nephroblastoma that rarely occurs in adults.	0.7202772615901668
There is no unanimous opinion on the biological behavior of mesoblastic nephroma because the tumor behaves differently.	0.8721985901258038
The question of whether nephrectomy is indicated if there are no malignant features is also open.	1.1622984958396982
The decision depends on the given case.	0.6837069048766966
Nephrectomy can only be avoided if the intraoperative situation allows the tumor to be removed with an adequate distance from healthy tissue.	1.089514864854015
The safety margin is necessary because mesoblastic nephroma shows fingerlike spread into the surrounding tissue.	0.8165113574650238
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) is a non-invasive method of recording quantitative data from gas exchange and ventilation for the evaluation of oxidative metabolism at rest and during exercise.	1.0623399732917853
Determination of oxygen uptake (VO2) and carbon dioxide output (VCO2) describes the activity of anaerobic vs aerobic metabolism.	0.9649399245814416
An incremental exercise test measuring gas exchange, ventilation and lactate release was performed in healthy volunteers and in patients suffering from mitochondrial disorders.	0.9769788336697889
At rest as well as during exercise patients with mitochondrial disorders differ from healthy subjects with regard to gas exchange and ventilation parameters.	1.0294478626964862
During exercise, the decreased oxygen utilization of skeletal muscle and early activation of anaerobic metabolism in these patients are mirrored by a reduced anaerobic threshold, reduced maximal oxygen uptake and reduced oxygen pulse.	1.08664557979896
Our study shows that CPX is a sensitive and practical clinical screening method of investigating mitochondrial disorders.	0.8753296180765489
Monitoring of pH of the esophagus is a routine diagnostic procedure, whereas until now pH-monitoring of the hypopharynx has been used only for scientific research.	1.2029288080340972
In the present study a critical evaluation scale was used to record the results of 112 patients who underwent pH monitoring to determine possible reflux.	1.2439057493320678
Since high refluxes often remain unnoticed clinically, further study is required in certain cases.	1.1458028196670942
The extent of reflux in the esophagus may not represent pathological changes in the hypopharynx.	0.9084486137132123
In such cases 24-h pH monitoring of the hypopharynx can be a useful diagnostic procedure and may also help detect the pathogenesis of "gastric laryngitis".	1.1691063699778974
The occurrence of plasmodial giant cells in the liver is probably a morphological reaction pattern with the most diverse causes.	1.015143540700142
In babies and infants, these changes occur in particular in neonatal hepatitis and intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct atresia.	1.0094719809861201
Viral infections and/or autoimmune reactions are discussed etiologically in giant cell hepatitis in adults (adult giant cell hepatitis, AGCH), which is much rarer.	1.1047611997458249
In some of the cases, there were conspicuously high titers against paramyxoviruses.	1.179236238779382
Giant cell hepatitis can occur in the course of HIV infection.	0.8970773039013853
These both indicate an infectious cause.	0.5513924790763632
However, the disease cannot be transmitted to chimpanzees.	1.16176552435203
Apart from our case, only one further case is described in the literature in which a completed hepatitis A infection could be demonstrated serologically.	1.289195913906063
In addition, the titer of antinuclear antibodies was raised in our patient.	0.9195936920550251
This autoimmune phenomenon is probably of crucial pathogenetic significance in our patient, especially since a hepatitis A infection on its own does not afford an adequate etiological explanation for the form of chronic and active hepatitis with consecutive cirrhotic transformation observed here.	1.1035003121410027
In patients with a significant elongation of the ACL we propose a new therapeutic regimen.	1.2531407985596987
After mobilisation of the tibial insertion of the ACL we pull the bone block with the attached ACL distally.	0.8084786323657147
Thus the ACL is easily tightened.	0.6808245373942289
In accordance with this method, we describe the treatment of a case of a strictly proximal rupture of the ACL: the tibial insertion is mobilised, the bone block with the attached ACL removed from the joint.	1.4159462077913811
Ex vivo sutures are placed into the ACL, the ligament is pulled back into the joint, and the shortening of the ligament caused by the sutures is compensated by slight proximal dislocation of the bone block.	1.1608337072529822
Purpose: One aspect of biocompatibility of IOLs can be tested using specular microscopy of the anterior and posterior surface of the lens in vivo.	1.0259942764093362
Background: The paper focuses on the issues, how couples cope with SIDS and how this can be facilitated by subsequent children, self-help and professional support.	1.0364143630163827
Methods: In a retrospective study, 60 couples, members of a self-help organization, were studied at the average of 5 years (2-215 months) after their loss.	1.3346431495055193
Depression, anxiety, physical complaints and grief were assessed by standardized questionnaires.	0.8065112293883688
A community sample of equal size of men and women of the same age were used as controls.	0.9497561777587699
Results: Average scores of depression and physical complaints were elevated compared to the community sample.	1.138044173616162
Men and women coped differently with the loss: Bereft mothers were more depressed and ruminated more about cause and preventability of the death than fathers.	0.8810991037644905
They expressed their grief more openly and found it more helpful to speak about their loss.	0.74510543451899
The presence of subsequent children was of prime importance for coping with the loss; an early subsequent pregnancy was fraught with increased anxiety.	0.9898269509360829
Conclusions: The self-help group serves an important function as a coping resource; the pediatrician plays a key role in the psychosocial care of the afflicted families.	1.0654052060350059
A 63-year-old women developed livedo reticularis during treatment with amantadine.	0.9008026810417634
This reversible side effect of amantadine has been most often seen in women and is frequently associated with persistent ankle edema.	0.9695629418028443
We discuss the signs and symptoms, pathogenesis and treatment of amantadine-induced livedo reticularis.	0.9695984958329434
Despite the diagnostic criteria of the ICD-10 and DSM-IV, the term borderline has been used in a non-specific way for a long time.	1.1357103107601316
For our investigation we constructed a questionnaire, which contained the ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for the borderline personality disorder (BPD), plus the criteria for the other personality disorders and for the schizotype disorder.	1.1530551138078873
The two additional criteria for the BPD used by the DSM-IV were added.	1.0186985714376773
800 psychiatrists and psychologists were asked to mark all criteria, which they thought were typical for the BPD.	1.0175661090469048
By using the operational diagnostic approach for ICD-10 and DSM-IV a disorder was diagnosed from each of the 162 received questionnaires based on the marked criteria.	1.0395602616274948
92,0% of the questionnaires contained marked criteria for the diagnosis of the BPD by ICD-10 and 96,3% by DSM-IV.	1.296677675358427
In addition each questionnaire contained up to eight other diagnosis.	0.7224651213058212
This is a sign for the difficulty to separate the BPD from other personalitiy disorders or the schizotype  disorder by using operationalised criteria.	1.0173063777654006
Looking at the lack of specifity of the operational diagnostic systems for personality  disorders, e.g.	0.7920165415140255
for the BPD which has been discussed by many authors for years, modification of the diagnostic systems should be considered.	1.1144848061785146
Neurobiological research has implicated the dopamine and serotonin system in the pathogenesis of self-injurious behavior.	0.871143890705117
The efficacy of antipsychotic drugs has been questioned.	0.6142382137734319
Opened and controlled investigations have shown risperidone is effective for reducing self-injurious behaviour in mentally retardation.	0.8978870108865807
We report about 3 mentally retarded patients which were given open-label riperidone for 12 weeks.They participated in a detailed assessment of behaviour symptoms at baseline and the repititive behaviour was weekly rated with the disability assessment schedule (DAS).	0.9907174939193766
Purpose: To test the capabilities of vacuum core biopsy (VCB) in the diagnosis of mammographically indeterminate lesions.	1.0523382866905926
Materials and Methods: 120 patients (131 lesions) were examined using VCB with 14G or 11G vacuum core.	1.0877555265954695
Radiologic information systems (RIS) and picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) are becoming increasingly widespread.	1.0319339440226314
This leads to new demands on the integration of the individual, formerly independent information systems (RIS, modalities, PACS).	0.9939948598418472
Possible ways of integrating individual systems are introduced.	0.7160430683547457
Besides the detailed description of different realizations of system communication, its role in the PACS at the university hospital in Freiburg is explained.	1.020570922272183
The integration of different information systems still requires the use of proprietary interfaces.	0.8738860620293387
An appropriate integration generally has been realized in Freiburg.	0.6672733838407277
In the near future DICOM basic worklist management will standardize system integration and render an interdepartmental workflow concept possible.	0.7409858876680635
Even though an available communication standard exists, not all problems in the RIS-modality interface are solved.	0.9188323366845671
Different data models in the various RI systems and modalities demand certain degrees of freedom in the standard.	0.8394391855035789
Thus a satisfactory workflow cannot be guaranteed even when all involved systems conform with the standard.	0.8219484925786645
Background: Denecke developed 1957 a surgical strategy consisting of three or four operative steps for rehabilitation of patients with unilateral paralysis of IXth and Xth cranial nerve.	1.099222928960762
These four steps are the following: myotomy of the cricopharyngeal muscle, resection of the paralyzed pharyngeal wall, medialization of the paralyzed vocal cord and fixation of the soft palate to the posterior pharyngeal wall which can be facultative.	1.0224061736875227
Reconstruction of the navel after tumour excision with subsequent navel resection is of great aesthetic importance for the patient.	0.9141863468030402
Methods of navel reconstruction are found in the literature but do not provide an elegant solution to the problem.	1.0614971934553956
Our method permits reconstruction of the navel during wound closure, by creation of two opposing trapezoidal skin flaps at the excision margin in the midline of the body; the umbilical fossa is then restored by jointly anchoring these flaps to the linea alba.	1.010738768415206
Reconstruction has been successfully carried out in this way after melanoma excision in 7 patients.	1.0666079663139307
Mammography is an established diagnostic procedure for breast cancer.	0.9013696991828493
Data concerning screening mammography are available from nine prospectively controlled trials, the largest series being presented from Sweden.	0.9981879834800053
Mammographic screening leads to a significant reduction of breast cancer of 30 % in women ages 50-59 years.	1.235310260924707
In younger women (40-49 years) the benefit accounts to only 20 % and has not proven to be statistically significant.	1.4006601675771888
Nevertheless, the major advantage of mammographic screening is detection of the non-palpable tumor <= 10 mm in size.	1.2123643787602238
The treatment of these small breast carcinomas leads to long-term survival rates of >= 90 %.	1.2265685015854106
Mammographic screening programs have been introduced in the USA, Canada, Iceland and Sweden for women in their 5th decade of life.	0.9036985950981842
Starting yearly lifelong mammography-screening at the age of 40, the theoretical cancer induction by radiation exposure does not exceed 0.1 %.	0.9804045268089361
Under highly qualified conditions, it should be possible to minimize false-positive and false-negative screening results.	1.0436316859303043
In Germany, screening-mammography is only introduced in patients at high risk for breast cancer.	1.0262956840751616
Based on medical data, mammography must be a part of screening for women with an average risk - starting at the age of 40, although there are still open questions needing further clinical research.	1.1586899399740733
Upper lid closure in facial nerve paresis induced lagophthalmos is often improved by implantation of gold weights.	0.7938554487799258
However, the tolerability of gold implants has not always met expectations.	1.0047613407378697
We therefore investigated whether results could be improved by implantation of well-tolerated platinum implants.	0.9009745788260852
Methods to determine the mechanical properties of surgical wounds and sutures are valuable tools in wound healing research.	0.7612774135088121
So far standardized testing procedures have not been defined in the surgical literature, which reduces the comparability of results from different authors.	1.1612108809518467
Therefore we suggest a modified tensile testing procedure which follows German industrial standards (DIN 53 455).	0.8368003359960099
The experimental set-up includes an universal testing machine and special clamps.	0.7521541092790617
The dumbbell-shaped specimen consist of freshly prepared pig skin and the suture which is to be tested.	0.9132538241612054
Well-known mechanical properties of surgical sutures and wounds were used to approve the precision of the experimental set-up.	1.0296582767589875
Reproducible analysis of all tested sutures and wounds (n = 120) was possible.	1.234940530592331
We recommend testing procedures adapted to industrial standards to obtain comparable results in determination of mechanical properties of surgical wounds and sutures.	0.8484250544623019
Abstract  An infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) leads to a large variety of complications affecting almost every organ system.	0.928962695121707
With the increasing numbers of HIV infections, some authors have reported an occasional association between an infection with HIV and arterial aneurysm.	1.09432536411601
However, complications affecting the vascular system demanding surgical intervention are rare.	1.3603466406163893
Partial nasal obstruction in preterm and term infants increases airway resistance.	0.7052047005935324
It may reduce ventilation and cause disturbances of respiratory regulation.	0.8242440592531574
Although this is well established, nasogastric tubes are commonly used, because orogastric tubes are difficult to secure.	1.005299440672176
A new technique for fixing orogastric tubes was tested in a prospective study in 11 preterm and term infants over a 4 weeks period.	1.038728353303955
There was no preterm dislocation of an oral tube in 7 patients.	1.0123174740952388
The orogastric tube had to be reinserted once before regular change in 3 patients and only 1 patiend aged 15 weeks presented with multiple dislocations of the tube.	0.9911834020966445
On the basis of a 3 days period for regular change of the orogastric tube the reliability of this new technique was 86,2% for all patients and 92,5% for patients below 8 weeks of age.	1.3201380226512485
Mesenchymal neoplasms of lipogenic differentiation are the most common soft-tissue neoplasms in adults.	0.9662271329438915
In recent years a number of "new" entities and variants have been described.	0.9494257271353929
Their recognition is important to avoid diagnostic pitfalls and inappropriate therapy.	0.823601383869833
Chondroid lipoma, myolipoma, and purely cutaneous spindle-cell/pleomorphic lipoma are biologically benign neoplasms which may mimic sarcomas morphologically.	0.9599639902093039
Despite high-grade morphology cutaneous liposarcomas carry a favorable clinical prognosis.	0.855332356104975
Spindle cell liposarcoma is a rare variant of atypical lipomatous tumour (well-differentiated liposarcoma) and must be distinguished from dedifferentiated liposarcoma with metastatic potential and benign spindle cell lipoma.	0.9896516100601539
The advent of cytogenetic and molecular investigations of lipomatous neoplasms has contributed to a better understanding of the biology of these neoplasms and led to a modification of conventional classification schemes.	0.8763900399625417
The intracranial space is divided into two large compartments by the tentorium.	0.9162958613813204
The hydrostatic pressure of spinal fluid is responsible for buoyancy of the brain within these compartments.	0.9662912664468308
In patients with craniectomy this equilibrium is exposed to atmospheric pressure.	0.6930014523955436
We report on four cases of reversible herniation after either bilateral or unilateral decompressive craniectomy performed for increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and failure of conservative ICP treatment.	1.0508698778859824
All four patients had survived a severe neurological disease (encephalitis, subdural haematoma, stroke) which required craniectomy to control raised ICP.	1.0805949189545374
All were successfully weaned from the ventilator and awake and CT scans showed no space-occupying lesion anymore.	0.9043841145998813
The patients showed a typical "sunken pattern" at the trepanation site.	1.0767159705950533
All patients developed clinical signs of transtentorial herniation (i.e.	0.6133918332995311
unilateral dilated pupils, deteriorated alertness, and extensor posturing) shortly after either diagnostic or presumed therapeutic lumbar puncture.	0.9018057966264904
One patient developed herniation a second time while in the typical 30 ° upright position.	1.0460422303436647
After craniectomy, transtentorial herniation is possible even in the absence of increased ICP.	0.855880484072444
It is related to a negative gradient between atmospheric and intracranial pressure, which is enhanced by changes in the CSF compartment following lumbar puncture.	1.0525030777142106
Lumbar puncture should be avoided if possible and, when necessary, only be performed in the head-down position.	1.3418353394607576
Acute therapy in these cases is quite simple; it requires flat or even head-down positioning and early cranioplasty.	1.0737025069665593
Diseases of the oral cavity, floor of the mouth, and nervous system can be accompanied by disturbances in tongue movement during swallowing.	0.8195529276762622
These disturbances can be diagnosed by videosonography whereby the examiner has to evaluate extensive video documentation of lingual motion.	0.9043405576045804
It was the aim of this study to facilitate this evaluation by the application of a reproducible computer-assisted quantitative analysis procedure.	1.0575874944649015
Video sequences of 56 healthy adults and 19 patients with dysphagias of different etiologies were analysed.	0.9660874370587226
A numerical estimation of swallowing movements was carried out in abstraction from the structures imaged (bolus, air, muscles of the tongue, floor of the mouth, hyoid, etc.).	0.876294587595483
Intensity changes of the pixels within previously defined radial image sectors were quantified in relationship to time and depicted as sector curves.	0.8048371180509966
The healthy adults demonstrated a characteristic pattern of two motion maxima that appeared within almost all sector curves.	0.853572898372876
These maxima represented bolus transport movements and the reset movement of the tongue.	0.7742072106462767
Patients with diseases of the tongue or neuromuscular changes caused by disturbances of the central nervous system showed pathological deviations on videosonography.	0.8954698833645712
These appeared as local or general reductions in movement, slow speed motions, repetitive swallowing or unsorted additional movements of the tongue during swallowing.	0.9505649264418984
Clinically-used ketamine is a racemic mixture of two isomers, S-(+)- and R-(-)-ketamine.	1.0859568016713286
Previous investigations showed the anaesthetic potency of S-(+)-ketamine to be three times higher than that of R-(-)-ketamine.	1.1026867725561402
It was the aim of this study to compare the effects of S-(+)-ketamine and racemic ketamine on endocrine and cardiovascular parameters, recovery, and side effects in geriatric patients during total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) for orthopaedic surgery.	0.9839054101519001
Forty patients over 60 years of age scheduled for elective hip or knee replacement were investigated in a double-blind, randomised design.	0.9852857899092295
For induction of TIVA, patients received 0.1 mg midazolam, 0.5 mg atropine, 1 mg/kg S(+)-ketamine or 2 mg/kg racemic ketamine, respectively, 2 mg vecuronium, and 1.5 mg/kg suxamethonium.	1.3490630412684046
After intubation and relaxation with a total dose of 0.1 mg/kg vecuronium, a continuous infusion of 2 mg/kg per hour S-(+)- or 4 mg/kg per hour racemic ketamine was administered throughout surgery.	1.0920353307662682
Blood samples were taken through a central venous catheter at seven time-points, before induction as well during and after surgery, until the 1st postoperative morning for analysis of adrenaline, noradrenaline (by high-pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection), anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol (by radioimmunoassay), glucose, and lactate.	1.2213651532400822
In addition, systolic arterial pressure (SAP), heart rate (HR), and arterial oxygen saturation were measured, and the time intervals between the end of ketamine infusion and the return of consciousness and orientation were protocolled.	1.272842194519544
The incidence and assessment of dreams and other side effects were reported by the patients.	0.9502118758873892
Biometric data of the groups were comparable, the mean age of both groups being 68 years.	1.2570777565163092
Plasma adrenaline, noradrenaline, ADH, ACTH, cortisol, and glucose as well as SAP and HR increased significantly (P<0.05) during the course of anaesthesia.	0.998460333167826
The influence on lactate levels was not significant.	0.7771447065322779
There were no differences between S-(+)- and racemic ketamine with respect to these parameters.	0.9863900841718938
Three patients in the ketamine-racemate group showed severe arterial hypertension and were withdrawn from the study.	0.931445458888748
Recovery clearly improved after administration of S-(+)-ketamine compared to the racemate.	0.8967855771454321
Simple orders were followed after 2.0 +/- 3.4 versus 4.9 +/- 6.8 min (P=0.07), orientation with respect to person returned after 5.7 +/- 4.0 versus 14.6 +/- 10.0 min (P<0.001) and spatial orientation after 8.2 +/- 5.4 versus 17.4 +/- 9.7 min (P<0.001).	1.1503641521805152
After racemic ketamine, 1 patient remembered a negative dream and 1 patient a positive dream.	1.1173646671803281
In the S-(+)-group, 1 positive dream was reported.	0.8955192582768198
No intraoperative awareness was reported, and all patients would accept the same anaesthesia again.	0.9676710986616941
Increases in cardiovascular parameters and insufficient reduction of the stress response with respect to ADH, ACTH, and cortisol seem to require a more potent hypnotic element during TIVA with ketamine.	0.9746687295296604
With regard to endocrine and cardiovascular parameters, the pharmacodynamic effects of racemic and S-(+)-ketamine were comparable.	0.8999590146309889
Because of the significant improvement in recovery and the reduced quantitative drug load, S-(+)-ketamine offers a clinical advantage compared with currently used racemic ketamine.	0.9361762935559437
The closure of large circular defects on the scalp is technically difficult and cosmetically often not satisfying, if a free transplant is necessary.	1.0391727319239286
Following the technique of Tillmann described first in 1908, several flaps shaped like a windmill can be combined.	0.9045637252766573
We report on 14 patients (ages 41-88 years) where large defects resulting from the excision of various tumors (5 melanomas, 5 basal cell carcinomas, 1 keratoacanthoma, 1 trichilemmal cyst, 1 squamous cell carcinoma, 1 skin metastasis) were successfully closed by this method.	1.2866809259200098
The diameter of the defect ranged between 4 and 8 cm (mean 5,7 cm).	1.0523414595329914
Size and number of the rotating flaps (3 or 4) was varied according to the size of the defect and the mobility of the surrounding tissue.	1.2372393828537103
The procedure was performed with local anesthesia in all cases.	1.2034578969799137
Wound healing occurred without complications except in 3 cases.	0.8503624525771164
2 patients (63 years, 70 years) developed small necrotic areas on the tips of the flaps.	1.00479385545041
In a 74 year old man with a very large defect of 8 cm diameter, one flap of four underwent total necrosis.	1.0234990737078113
The cosmetic result was rated "very good" in 71,4% and "good" in 14,3%.	1.1058682603999395
The preservation of the terminal hair turned out to be of special advantage.	1.0556515307665795
The "windmill procedure" is an important addition to the surgical approaches for closure of large defects on the scalp, particularly in young patients.	1.2027360482466714
Intimal sarcoma of the pulmonary artery is an extremely rare type of malignant tumor of the large vessels.	1.0798115507523416
Despite systematic diagnostics, distinguishing between pulmonary emboli and tumors is difficult.	0.70689775751792
We report a patient who was referred because of suspected embolic occlusion of the pulmonary artery.	1.0669719869669558
The operation was started with the intention of performing a pulmonary artery thromboendarterectomy; however, intraoperative histology revealed a malignant mesenchymal tumor.	1.161682582855217
Therefore, the left lung was resected with the use of extracorporeal circulation, and the pulmonary trunk and right pulmonary artery were reconstructed.	1.3541748530297455
A solitary right lung metastasis was resected 3 months later using stapling devices.	0.8265241200743869
Complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice for patients with sarcoma of the pulmonary arteries.	1.0176300527883095
Surgical therapy often includes extensive reconstructive measures.	0.5816781846035001
Since, thromboembolic obstruction cannot be excluded preoperatively, patients with this type of disease should be treated at centers experienced with the broad spectrum of pulmonary artery surgery.	1.1455719194837937
Abstract  A rare cause of painful swelling of the knee cavity can be an aneurysm of the popliteal vein.	1.2036012867434571
Only 28 cases are reported in the literature.	0.5606477896544272
We treated a 20-year-old male patient who underwent three arthroscopies, one operation and one MRI; finally, phlebography detected a popliteal vein aneurysm and a malformation of the deep venous system of the popliteal and proximal calf veins.	1.1761961425192928
To avoid the threat of pulmonary embolism a resection of the aneurysm with interposition of a venous autograft was performed.	1.0146379907647163
Twelve months after the operation the patient is free of symptoms with a patent autograft.	1.2361503715191302
Hearing aids have fundamental disadvantages: (1) stigmatization of the patient; (2) the sound is often found to be unsatisfactory due to the limited frequency range and undesired distortion; (3) in many patients, the ear canal fitting device generally necessary leads to an occlusion effect; (4) acoustic feedback when amplification is high.	1.2183134439899257
Conventional hearing aids transmit sound into the ear canal via a small microphone.	0.8054883394247367
Sound has the disadvantage of requiring high output sound pressure levels for its transmission.	0.8454546420980475
This along with the necessary miniaturization of the loudspeaker as well as the resonances and reflections in the closed ear canal contribute to the disadvantages mentioned.	1.0661638918461251
In contrast, implantable hearing aids do not make sound signals but micromechanical vibrations.	0.9456575938538659
An implantable hearing aid has an electromechanical transducer instead of the loudspeaker of a conventional hearing aid.	0.8773057079538636
The hearing signal does not leave the transducer as sound but as a mechanical vibration which is directly coupled to the auditory system bypassing the air.	0.8344110971912102
This implantable hearing aid is either coupled to the tympanic membrane, the ossicular chain, the perilymph of the inner ear, or the skull.	1.1704352193536058
Corneal cells are known to participate in the regulation of local inflammatory processes by secretion of cytokines.	0.8716876889566971
As the corneal endothelium may be exposed to endotoxin in organ culture and endotoxin is known to trigger inflammatory reactions, we investigated the effect of endotoxin from E. coli on organ cultured donor corneae with respect to autocrine and paracrine functions and the endothelial viability and density.	0.9967749470061253
For the majority of patients with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) many available hearing aids often do not achieve satisfactory results.	0.787405746739718
For these patients partially implantable hearing devices have been developed, allowing distortion-free hearing and speech intelligibility that may be superior to conventional hearing aids.	1.0245687664223324
The external parts of partial implants, however, may result in a patient's stigmatization.	1.2202568827490878
Furthermore, they do not use the acoustic properties of the external auditory canal.	1.4054786122462803
Recently, we published the successful development of the first totally implantable hearing device for the treatment of SNHL (HNO 46 [1998] 853-863).	1.1526117739840427
Here we report the first implantations of this unique, totally implantable electronic hearing system in patients with SNHL: Implex TICA LZ 3001.	1.0057201990969458
The implant microphone is implanted subcutaneously in the outer ear canal near the ear drum.	0.8413833880005314
The signal is processed by a digitally programmable multichannel audioprocessor located subcutaneously on the bony skull behind the ear.	0.7332153592360552
A piezoelectric transducer is coupled to the body of the incus and drives the ossicular chain by vibratory actions.	0.8274492468863514
Energy is provided by an implantable battery.	0.7698280913825915
Implanted patients describe hearing as being distortion-free and transparent.	0.8457103545550768
Speech intelligibility and the hearing of music are improved.	0.7361323280553214
Patients may achieve better speech discrimination, especially in the presence of background noise.	0.8863481962909168
The aid can be used during sports, including swimming.	1.1931813487915726
To our knowledge, this is the first report of the implantation of a totally implantable electronic hearing system in patients.	0.8225998333857432
These results encourage further implantations of the totally implantable hearing system in the course of an ongoing clinical study.	0.9809380217522687
Catheter ablation by means of radiofrequency energy (RF) is an established method in the treatment of various forms of supraventricular and atrioventricular tachycardias.	1.0144495589785032
In patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT), the success of catheter ablation depends on the pathophysiological mechanism of the arrhythmia and on the underlying heart disease.	1.0779229364967882
In the following report we give a definition of the terms nomenclature and classification.	1.0154521043659328
We find out, that the two terms are very similar.	1.0870042961840864
They include the keys for diagnosis and therapy.	0.7526050997816669
We propose a method to construct new coding-systems.	0.7551447208760291
Furthermore we report about the existing coding-systems in Orthopaedics and Traumatology.	0.9622114255723496
We cite a list of national and international coding-systems.	0.6637622882132356
Because of the actuality we finally give a definition of the term "Indikationsspezifische Komplikation", which is of importance since the "5.	1.1857440199397127
Änderungsverordnung" of the "BPFLV-95" within the classification of the "Fallpauschalen".	1.0796655161803164
"Fallpauschalen" are a system like the American DRG's (Diagnosis related groups), but not exacly the same.	1.2608808848687345
Resection of a stenosing colon tumor in an 89-year-old male patient led to the diagnosis, unusual at this age, of an inflammatory pseudotumor (synonym: plasma cell granuloma) of the retroperitoneum and mesentery, which invaded the large bowel and showed infiltration of one regional lymph node.	1.1721948917051572
Histology and immunohistochemistry (demonstrating a myofibroblastic phenotype of the proliferating spindle cells and polyclonality of abundantly present plasma cells) of the specimen resembled previously reported lesions in various locations.	0.9829104979849658
The etiology and exact nosological classification of inflammatory pseudotumors are not yet unequivocally settled.	0.9453702813203558
The recently published conjecture that such lesions of the retroperitoneum represent a separate entity with features of a malignant neoplasm is discussed.	1.092110972856007
An example of a plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumour (PFT) is presented for the first time in the German-language literature.	1.203951157895825
The diagnostic criteria for this rare soft-tissue neoplasm of childhood and young adulthood, which is mostly subcutaneous in location and has a tendency to recur, include the plexiform structure which gives it its name, extensive siderin deposits and numerous osteoclast-like giant cells.	1.1304128244633036
The development of the tumour described here, which occurred in the field of radiation of a malignant haemangiopericytoma excised 7 years previously, indicates the possibility of induction of PFT by radiation.	1.2167051736996415
The current increase in the cost of health care must be considered as a severe threat to the prehospital emergency services system.	1.1106645735389002
Two examples have been selected - the patient with polytrauma and the patient in cardiac arrest - to demonstrate the dilemma between a need for objective data and the requirements of emergency patients.	1.5558524974787018
Study results obtained in trauma patients indicating that total prehospital time, including scene time, is correlated to patient outcome have led to the conclusion that at the scene treatment by emergency physicians may be dispensable.	1.146264769468671
It has, however also been demonstrated that the time required for medical treatment at the scene is equivalent to 20% of the total scene time, thus representing only a fraction of the total prehospital time.	1.2851680559472614
Correlating the total prehospital time or scene time to outcome therefore appears absurd.	0.7473492681569166
The treatment principle of aggressive shock treatment in polytrauma needs critical reevaluation on the basis of results obtained by recent preclinical studies in patients with penetrating torso injuries.	1.0252379288322018
Small volume resuscitation could not be demonstrated to improve outcome in polytrauma patients, although a slight improvement in patients with brain injury may be assumed.	1.1633048127423344
Endotracheal intubation and early artificial ventilation are proven therapeutic principles in polytraumatized patients.	0.8469508144842782
Unfortunately, for ethical reasons randomised carefully controlled comparative studies can not be performed in polytrauma patients unless the patient is fully conscious.	1.2325817442464406
The importance of endotracheal intubation and artificial ventilation in unconscious trauma patients becomes apparent under conditions of anaesthesia where the application of the endotracheal tube averts regurgitation, aspiration and concomitant morbidity and mortality.	0.9442968632112101
The common causes of cardiovascular collapse and their pathomechanisms, as well as the mechanisms of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, have been widely investigated.	1.1237672819676647
Nevertheless, various aspects of their application are still controversial.	1.2898062398108519
The most recent study results have recommended initial ventilation prior to thoracic compression.	0.9021880777630875
New methods of assisting mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation, such as ACD CPR or vest CPR, have shown promising results in animal experiments.	0.9813704465399293
However, the importance of results obtained by preclinical randomised controlled investigations in humans need to be confirmed by further studies as to outcome.	1.0228075667000804
The efficacy of defibrillation in cases of ventricular fibrillation has been clearly demonstrated, particularly with a view to the interval between ventricular fibrillation and defibrillation.	1.1360205958602003
It has further been demonstrated that basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation preserves ventricular fibrillation and thus improves the chance of survival.	0.8268959871431525
The present generation of defibrillators has been further improved, particularly by the introduction of biphasic defibrillator wave forms, which may reduce the required energy, as well as possible complications, while offering an increase in the efficacy of defibrillation and a reduction in defibrillator size.	1.1293542111535617
Scientific emergency medicine is responsible not only for the development and validation of new methods and concepts, but in particular for their application under quality control conditions.	1.2314497143477376
Politicians require an improvement in the quality of the validation of emergency measures, although the instruments available for the investigation of these measures are known to be obsolete (experimental models, experimental design).	1.104158043962177
Additionally, the financial support of research in emergency medicine suffers from being accourded low priority by public research funds such as the German Research Fund.	0.9559077181404572
However, in view of the rapid application of experimental results to daily practice it should be emphasized that patients also support research in emergency medicine via their direct financial contributions to the health insurance companies.	1.067645255649984
The prognosis in patients with gynecologic cancers depends not only on the stage but also on a wide spectrum of other findings.	0.9800281844596042
Cross-sectional imaging modalities, including sonography, CT and MRI, have increasingly been used for optimal treatment planning in gynecologic cancers.	1.1758428135707153
Their staging criteria are based on the well-established FIGO staging system.	1.023702658705299
CT and MRI compete with sonography, which plays a pivotal role in the evaluation of the female pelvis.	1.0137938407600733
This paper reviews the role of sonography, CT and MRI in the staging of gynecologic malignancies.	0.9441895501096056
It puts the emphasis on MRI, which has been established as imaging modality of choice in the preoperative evaluation of cervical and endometrial cancer, and which seems slightly superior to CT in the staging of ovarian cancer.	1.183266306758562
Extraabdominal desmoids represent one group of deep fibromatoses.	0.7506818159019325
These aggressive nonmetastasizing tumorlike lesions have a strong tendency to local infiltration, with a recurrence rate of about 40 %.	1.100772330583891
Trauma, hormones and heredity have been implicated as etiologic factors.	0.7500912979499582
Shoulder, chest wall, back and thigh are favored sites.	0.7828503501174009
By combination of different diagnostic procedures the number of differential diagnoses can be reduced to only a few.	1.0864891599597997
While in former times surgery was thought to be the only kind of therapy, nowadays adjuvant procedures like radiation, hormonal therapy and also chemotherapy are becoming more and more important.	1.0866170741649412
Amputation or other mutilating procedures should be done only if the tumor recurs repeatedly.	0.9521830992559773
Katayama syndrome is an allergic reaction of antigens of schistosomes, known as the acute phase of schistosomiasis.	1.0668048393933336
We report on an eleven year-old boy, who was seen at our outpatient department because of cough and oedema of the face after travelling to Malawi.	1.2275663997914938
Remarkable findings were an eosinophilia and antibodies against schistosoma-antigens.	0.7015053780672461
Six weeks later the diagnosis was confirmed by detecting eggs of Schistosoma haematobium in the urine.	0.8313077271170891
Parasitological examinations of urine and faeces four months later were negative.	0.8056337451519422
There is still a significant lack of treatment and rehabilitation facilities for chronic pain patients in Germany today.	1.2595571890574813
Most of all the treatment of low back pain and widespread pain syndromes or panalgesia is time consuming and complicated.	1.147013188480923
The main problem of anaesthesiological pain clinics is the increase of these complex pain syndromes in the last years.	1.08084696255658
The definition of chronic pain is a contiuous noxious input modulated and compounded by the prolonged or recurrent nature of chronic state and further complicated by a multitude of economic and psychosocial factors.	0.9898509338686385
It is now clear that no one discipline or mode will suffice.	0.854242643327698
Only a multidisciplinary and intensive approache will prevail, as discussed in this article.	1.1215199415906776
Unfortunately these multidisciplinary pain units are nearly not existing in Gemany just as little as control of the effectiveness of pain treatment.	0.8762460290353372
The use of somato-sensory evoked potentials (SEP) in supraaortal reconstructions has been well accepted.	0.9695125843512076
However, reports about incidence and clinical significance of ischaemic SEP alterations differ widely.	1.1569758516589328
In a prospective study we registered SEP alterations during 482 operations done on 419 patients between 1 July 1994, and 31 December 1996.	1.088871940794572
Incidence, risk factors and clinical relevance were investigated.	0.9272997176575035
In only 1.7% of cases SEP examination was inadequate.	1.2058809805166757
During 406 operations SEP were altered minimally or not at all.	0.5702276538523786
Significant changes were dedected during 65 interventions (13.5%).	0.7594152586688256
The clinical outcome was poor when alteration was found during carotid dissection (five events, three deficits).	1.107603676043319
Cross-clamping ischaemia was the common reason for alterations (81.5%); they were generally reversible after shunting and without clinical significance.	1.0996500346696256
As risk factor for cross-clamping ischaemia, only contralateral carotid occlusion was identified.	1.0064316012086545
Tyrosine-rich crystalloids in tumors of the salivary glands are rare and have been reported mainly in specimens from Black African patients.	1.0664512607975516
The pathogenesis of these structures is still unclear, but pathological secretion by neoplastic myoepithelial cells is supposed.	1.1036683747267393
Millon's staining and ultrastructural examinations are used for confirming the diagnosis.	0.8154749178840383
We present the case report of a 59-year-old woman with a myoepithelioma of the minor salivary glands in the smooth palate containing tyrosine-rich crystalloids as an example of this rare phenomenon.	1.0208685472653396
Pseudoarthrosis and cubitus valgus as main complications following displaced fractures of the radial condyle in children can be prevented by open reduction and fixation by K wires.	0.9610425113791673
However, delayed union and stimulation of the radial physis with condylar overgrowth and varisation of the elbow as well as fishtail deformities of the distal end of the humerus are reported nevertheless.	1.23355664371986
To prevent those growth disturbances all primary and secondary (4-day X-ray control) displaced fractures of the radial condyle, i. e. those with a central gap of more than 2 mm, were prospectively treated by open reduction and osteosynthesis with a metaphyseal lag screw beginning 1974.	1.1088782897650873
Sixty-six patients (41 boys, 25 girls) with an average follow-up of 10 years (2-22 years) sustained 28 primary and 6 secondary displaced fractures.	1.3675598980308858
In 5 cases a K wire fixation was performed in view of the smallness of the fragment.	1.071514812354979
Two children with conservative treatment following overlooked displaced fractures showed condylar overgrowth and varisation of the elbow.	0.7956485771780716
Screw osteosynthesis led to symmetric elbow angles and function in all cases, whereas fishtail deformities could be observed in 8 of 27 children, probably as a consequence of the remaining central fracture instability.	1.1606651091649245
Conclusion: Open reduction and osteosynthesis with a metaphyseal lag screw prevents condylar overgrowth in displaced fractures of the radial condyle by guaranteeing fracture healing in anatomic position within 3-4 weeks.	1.05173224795425
However, fishtail deformity can not be prevented by metaphyseal compression only.	1.1589217486127048
A commercially available C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) concentrate was used for short-term prophylaxis before surgery in two patients with hereditary angioneurotic oedema.	1.0156874039802946
The patients suffered from recurrent subcutaneous and submucosal oedema of the face, extremities, and gastrointestinal tract as the result of a hereditary C1-INH deficiency.	0.988144316012008
Both patients were receiving tranexamic acid or danazol therapy as oral long-term prophylaxis.	0.8825178241389998
Over the years the patients underwent several operations in regional and general anaesthesia, with mask ventilation or intubation.	1.0863092383278845
The C1-INH plasma concentrations measured preoperatively were always very low (0.02-0.06 g/l, normal range 0.15-0.35 g/l), despite the oral long-term prophylaxis.	1.2414796079724137
Substitution treatment with 500-1000 U C1-INH was performed 1 h before surgery.	0.8681972713931146
No side effects were seen following the concentrate infusions.	0.8261350028201309
With this substitution treatment no specific symptoms of hereditary angioneurotic oedema were recognized in either case.	0.826890708935346
The measurement of C1-INH plasma concentration 2 h or 4 h after C1-INH substitution showed a marked rise in both patients, though normal values were not reached in either.	1.006249008649344
We suggest that infusion of C1 concentrate is an appropriate form of preoperative substitution treatment in patients with hereditary angioneurotic oedema, in view of the lower risk of infection than with infusion of fresh-frozen plasma and the observed effectiveness.	1.1364502716916174
This case report describes a 62 years old patient who suffered from therapy resisten atrial fibrillation for 12 years.	1.0766637015282245
She underwent "Cox/Maze-III-Procedure" during a mitral valve reconstruction and a stable sinus rhythm was achieved.	1.0054679395898056
Two years after operation she has been in a stable sinus rhythm.	0.9559133528170966
Transesophageal echocardiography revealed normal cardiac dimensions and function with coordinated atrioventricular contractility.	0.7279198687721256
Therefore the therapy with anticoagulants and antiarrhythmics could be discontinued.	0.8106602894023355
Two cases of congenital wandering spleen with typical clinical course are reported:  An 11-year old girl had a two month history of intermittent abdominal pain predominantly after physical stress.	1.1566131945275633
In upright position a palpable resistance could be identified as wandering spleen by ultrasound and scintiscan, and in this case splenopexy was performed.	1.1938064728876658
An otherwise healthy 3-year old girl suffered from acute abdomen caused by torsion of an upside- down spleen with partial infarction.	1.0924947895132187
Diagnosis was made based on ultrasound and CT-Scan.	0.9249505677038985
The extent of infarction could be evaluated by color flow sonography.	0.9553630695444874
After partial resection splenopexy in orthotopic position was performed.	0.6788825897133787
Discussion: In situations of intermittent abdominal pain as well as acute abdomen torsion of wandering spleen should be taken into consideration.	0.9426082947134088
Monodisciplinary orthopaedic pain therapy no longer measures up to international standards.	0.797473540767351
In cases of chronic back pain, in particular, there is such a gulf between the clinical findings and the patient's subjective assessment that the symptoms cannot be attributed solely to so-called degenerative changes.	1.2398591170483964
Back pain patients are in great danger of becoming fixated on somatic symptoms due to an excess of diagnostic procedures or incorrect diagnoses, of being treated purely somatically on the basis of associated findings, and of suffering irreversible damage from invasive management of such findings.	1.1435759559841308
Despite the wealth of empirical evidence, it remains difficult to expand the everyday concept of illness and its causes to include not only physical and biological factors but also social and emotional disturbances.	1.068930791722408
Particularly physicians with a purely biological concept of pain have not learned to take note of affective relational factors and incorporate them into their diagnostic assessment.	0.88973045683317
The decision to undertake invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedures then frequently represents the doctor's reaction to feelings of irritation or helplessness.	0.9318609824046785
If this situation is to change, an interdisciplinary concept of pain must be made a part of medical training, and scientific findings must be presented in such a way that they can be integrated into routine daily practice.	1.1175860403616005
The laboratory surveillance of measles in Germany contributes to an objective estimation of the situation.	0.8503707901172641
Compared to data of the pre-vaccination era, the incidence of measles has been reduced, while a shift in age towards the group of 15-year-olds is observed.	1.201535556495381
Germany will have considerable difficulties to reach the aim of eradicating measles in the European region by the year 2007.	1.1361838275916298
Apart from the fact that systematic surveillance is lacking, the immunity gaps in small children represent a particularly weak spot.	0.9434308758427788
In order to effectively control measles, high vaccination rates of at least 90% are necessary by the end of the second year of life.	1.178988557089582
In addition, laboratory surveillance has to be included to measure successful vaccination.	1.2927892189592576
Main focusses are the laboratory confirmation of suspected measles cases, seroprevalence studies of population immunity as well as the control of the circulation of measles viruses.	1.14302472918136
The Working Group Measles ("Arbeitsgemeinschaft Masern" - AGM) as well as the amended law on infection prevention are important instruments to make measurable progress towards measles eradication also in Germany.	1.1853204975779308
We report on the activities of the National Reference Centre for Measles, Mumps and Rubella since 1991.	1.0171012093000698
The German data are compared to those of selected other European countries.	0.8858241502533618
The different methods that are available for the assessment and quantification of "brittle nails" and for the evaluation of various therapeutical approaches are compared.	1.2773122660934855
At this time, measurement of the swelling properties is the best documented and most reliable method for studying the treatment of brittle nails.	1.064241139930809
Reliable qualitative data can also be obtained by scanning electron microscopy.	0.8700717292058341
Measurement of the transonychial water loss and assessment of thickness and density of nails by ultrasound have also been used successfully, but the methodology still has to be improved and the reproducibility, confirmed.	1.1626604922893555
The case of a closed elbow dislocation with complete rupture of the brachial artery and its veins is described.	1.1423904489285304
This combination of injuries is rather rare and only 25 cases were found in the literature.	0.9980793710825475
The sharp lesion of the vessels was remarkable, probably due to the edge of the distally ruptured capsule.	0.8831924034557334
Immediate revision with suture of the vessels and an immobilization for three weeks gave a good result.	0.9948142362536222
The management of multiple trauma patients has improved recently.	0.7586276082779455
Surgeons' education, preclinical rescue structures, initial clinical survey and therapeutic strategies, as well as diagnostic imaging, have progressed.	1.0015940028991746
Plain film imaging is increasingly being abandoned in favor of CT. Fast imaging techniques (spiral CT) have led to the inclusion of CT in the primary survey.	1.0676227842951729
To minimize the risk to the patient during prolonged diagnostic time, algorithms have to be defined concerning structures, emergency room equipment and quality.	1.137568848600092
Basics, state of the art and suggestions concerning management of multiple trauma patients are presented and discussed from the radiologist's point of view.	0.9640620456309884
The importance of hepatitis C virus infection has been recently noted in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or dilated cardiomyopathy.	0.8732126690070687
In a collaborative research project of the Committees for the Study of Idiopathic Cardiomyopathy, hepatitis C virus antibody was found in 74 of 697 patients (10.65) with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and in 42 of 663 patients (6.3%) with dilated cardiomyopathy; these prevalences were significantly higher than that found in volunteer blood donors in Japan.	1.1964330860185735
Hepatitis C virus antibody was detected in 650 of 11,967 patients (5.4%) seeking care in 5 academic hospitals.	1.1185267703574666
Various cardiac abnormalities were found, and arrhythmias were the most frequent.	1.0763208359565515
These observations suggest that hepatitis C virus infection is an important cause of a variety of otherwise unexplained heart diseases.	0.9821131572795345
Transdifferentiated retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) display enhanced contractile potentials and have been implicated in the development of tractional retinal detachment.	0.9510576901492453
This study determines the activity of contraction-promoting factors, examines some involved mechanisms and evaluates inhibitors.	0.78592991428673
Using an in vitro contractionassay, we demonstrated that collagen matrix contraction by transdifferentiated RPE cells is effectively stimulated by serum, platelet-derived growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-1.	1.0247818027149709
Endothelin-1 and transforming growth factor-1 and -2 have a more discrete or marginal effect.	1.3559962701611412
Tractional forces promoted by these peptides are completely protein synthesis dependent.	0.7286559401263203
Contraction stimulated by serum is only partly dependent on de novo protein synthesis, suggesting different active factors and/or pathways.	0.8934718854887144
Staurosporine, a broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor, effectively inhibited collagen matrix contraction by transdifferentiated RPE cells regardless of the promoter.	0.8361108495930278
Revascularization in cases of recurrent occlusions following aorto-iliac vascular reconstructions, particular in high-risk patients, poses a therapeutic dilemma.	0.8889499496848444
We report the case of a 78-year-old female patient who presented - after multiple vascular reconstructions of iliac and femoral arteries - with Leriche syndrome, resulting critical limb ischemia and concomitant coronary and lung disease.	1.11763553386193
Due to the high surgical and anesthetic risk we implanted an axillo-bifemoral PTFE graft.	0.9259767694252931
The preoperative angiography of the supraaortic branches revealed a high-grade stenosis of the right subclavian artery in the presence of a previously implanted carotid-subclavian bypass on the left.	1.1650230353990643
This stenosis was dilated and then stented by way of the proximal end of the axillo-bifemoral graft, which in turn was distally anastomosed to the right popliteal and left deep femoral artery.	1.0547280385487665
Postoperative angiography verified a good run-off and satisfactory vascular status was obtained.	0.8146559301043361
Duplex sonography 6 months after surgery showed a good flow and the patient was free of symptoms.	1.1910153308741072
These results demonstrate that, combined with intraoperative stent application, an axillo-bifemoral graft can be implanted with good results.	0.9844822745663968
Objective: Concerning the long-term somatic development of children born with very low birth weight and/or born very premature, there are varying and sometimes contradictory statements.	1.1078327894191387
A follow-up study was carried out on premature-born children from Thuringia and Saxonia at pre-school and early school age in order to investigate the long-term somatic development of these children.	1.000983300412477
Anthropological parameters were examined and compared with the data of a reference group.	1.178471606386953
Mediastinitis caused by infection with Clostridium perfringens and spontaneous rupture of the esophagus are both life threatening conditions.	0.9244886720054327
The combination of these two entities led to septic multiorgan failure in a 38-year-old woman.	0.9440544420734935
The patient was treated successfully by esophagectomy and postoperative lavage through a partially open abdomen.	0.9821076110849084
The lack of information regarding emesis, the leading symptom of Boerhaave's syndrome, caused delayed diagnosis: the triad of emesis, severe epigastric pain and emphysema of the skin was not established until 30 h after the onset of symptoms.	1.1155206742616401
For ethical and socio-economical reasons (cost-explosion in transfusion-medicine, patient's individual destiny), devepolment and consistent application of allogeneic transfusion sparing techniques in surgery is a chal- lenge to anesthesiologists, surgeons and blood-bankers.	1.0501865564859152
The combination of different techniques, i.e.	0.6464811845958865
autologous predonation, hemodilution, choice of anesthetic regimen, deliberate hypotension, application of anti-fibrinolytic agents and autotransfusion of intraoperatively saved blood allow for avoidance of allogeneic blood transfusion even in patients presenting important intraoperative hemorrhage.	0.9421797119626091
Introduction: If the surgeon cannot find the tendon of the superior oblique muscle in the right place, he has to change his operative plans intraoperatively.	1.2002127670205742
Different procedures are recommended: reinsertion of the superior oblique in the right place, recession of the inferior oblique muscle, and operations on the vertical muscles of the same or the yoke eye.	1.0746044939476487
No quantitative recommendations on the surgical amount are mentioned in the literature.	0.7356271872707514
In 180 children (87 children belonging to a control group, 68 with fever of non-renal origin, and 25 with pyelonephritis) albumin and immunoglobulin G (markers for glomerular dysfunction), -1-microglobulin and  -NAG (markers for proximal tubular dysfunction) and apolipoprotein A1 (marker of 'postrenal' dysfunction) were measured in second-voided morning urine.	1.0851387065455602
In children with fever of non-renal origin, glomerular dysfunction was encountered in 8.8 %, tubular dysfunction in 17.6 % and mixed glomerular-tubular dysfunction in 14.7 % of cases.	1.1398607752452976
Among children with pyelonephritis, 28 % revealed glomerular dysfunction and 44 % mixed glomerular-tubular dysfunction.	1.159775172816696
No case of solitary proximal tubular dysfunction was observed in children with pyelonephritis.	1.1209891243900578
There were highly significant differences in presence and expression of glomerular dysfunction between children with fever of non-renal origin and children with pyelonephritis (P < 0.0001), whereas with regard to proximal tubular dysfunction, the differences were only moderately significant ( -NAG: P < 0.01) or of low significance (-1-microglobulin: P < 0.05).	1.1427051223411144
This may indicate that morphologic changes occur during interstitial pyelonephritis due to inflammation of glomeruli, resulting in glomerular dysfunction, while proximal tubular dysfunction may additionally be due to fever-associated function processes.	0.9792377932412989
Up to the middle of the 1970s, chemotherapy had only a marginal role in the overall treatment concept for cervical carcinoma, and surgery and radiotherapy are still the cornerstones of treatment today.	1.2338349868709642
There are indications for chemotherapy, which can theoretically be used as follows:	1.3188479355368274
We compared a cw carbon dioxide flash-scanning laser system to an Er:YAG laser in laser skin resurfacing of facial rhytides.	0.8583523869987525
In all patients, CO2 laser treatment showed a better cosmetic result whereas erythema and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation were less marked in Er:YAG laser therapy.	0.846862773810141
A separation of the individual latex layers is a known complication of endotracheal armoured tubes manufactured by immersion technique.	0.9297819211258345
This can result in herniation into the lumen with obstruction of the tube.	0.7206939504896905
Diffusion of nitrous oxide into the inner hernia considerably intensifies the obstruction.	0.676958748718682
This can lead to life-threatening situations.	0.7886169565042966
We observed a similar herniation caused by layer separation with subsequent tube obstruction of silicolatex anaesthesia tubes used in paediatric circuit systems.	0.8682426383122623
This is caused by manufacturing defects and above all by damage incurred in reprocessing.	0.6805512918674171
Therefore it is important to process the tubes carefully.	0.8497859693905163
A too-high drying temperature can cause premature layer separation.	0.7106614092094149
The tubes should never be processed more than 80 times.	0.8028460825881638
Routine examination of the tubes is imperative, especially at the predilection sites for layer separation.	1.0179806074681725
Severe aortic valve disease is a rare complication of coarctation in adults.	1.1915152014880819
Between 1961 and 1990 aortic valve replacement was performed after or combined with the operation of coarctation in 24 adults (4% of entire population operated for coarctation).	1.128382076387457
Bicuspid aortic valves were present in 2/3 of patients.	0.9199757602496231
In 10 patients (710 with aortic stenosis) coarctation was operated early (mean age 24 years) and aortic valve late (mean age 40 years): in 14 (1014 with aortic regurgitation, mean age 40 years) aortic valve and coarctation were operated simultaneously (8 patients) or staged within 6 months (6 patients).	1.2204468862002305
Additional surgical interventions on the dilated aorta ascendens were performed in 8, mitral valve replacement in 2 and aorto-coronary bypass in 1 patients.	0.9507103910005209
Early mortality was 224 (8%) and was similar in simultaneously (18) and staged (114) operated cases: 10 year survival was lower than in an age-matched group of 72 patients with aortic valve disease of similar severity operated during the same period (70% vs 88%, p < 0.01): 67 late deaths were cardia; 55 pts with preoperatively severely increased end-diastolic (> 199 mlm2) and 44 with end-systolic (> 90 mlm2) left ventricular volumes and 22 with ejection fraction < 41 % died late postoperatively.	1.252382581184443
Abstract  13 experienced addiction therapists provid-ed information about trauma experiences and comorbidity of 122 clients (26 women and 96 men) with opiate addiction and multiple substance abuse.	0.9850013739717259
42% had had at least one traumatic life experience and the women had higher percentages than men.	1.0769264394442983
The victimization primarely took place during childhood and prior to the begin of drug consumption.	0.7728696219123589
26% of the trauma victims were diagnosed as having post-traumatic stress disorder.	1.1860048404719303
In comparison with individuals without trauma experiences, victims evidenced significantly more comorbid symptoms, they more frequently suffered from polytoxicomania and had more experiences with psychotherapy.	0.9826543287687938
Nearly all drugs currently used during the course of general anaesthesia may lead to hypersensitivity reactions of various types.	0.9328398650534953
There may be an acute type I allergic reactions or to a more or less severe pseudoallergic reactions, in rare cases with lethal outcome.	1.0439139071823722
Routine preoperative testing appears of little predictive value, in spite of the high frequency of so-called risk factors (atopy, other kind of allergy) among the evaluated group of patients.	1.0743174924798207
Careful allergological testing should be performed 4 to 6 weeks after any incidents of suspected drug intolerance, in order to discover the underlying causative agent.	1.0154827116381093
Skin testing is of diagnostic value for neuromuscular blockers and intravenous narcotics.	0.9156698657615269
RAST- and RIA-tests and/or mediator releasing tests may also used additionally.	0.9497351121357127
Together with all other administered drugs, all the routinely used neuromuscular blockers (suxamethonium, vecuronium, pancuronium, alcuronium, atracurium, mivacurium) should be tested, since they often represent the cause for such reactions.	1.0125271081354932
For other classes of drugs (for example, volatile anesthetics and opioids) the clinical relevance of skin testing still remains uncertain.	1.1164060121927364
For less severe incidents seen during general anaesthesia such as pruritus, or exanthems, skin testing seems to be less relevant.	1.0658996698982532
Nociception is a protective system of the body which prevents it from injury and tissue damage.	1.022418738419006
Human beings respond to noxious stimuli by moving away.	0.5721661200261103
They learn by pain to avoid these situations in future.	0.865491024940248
Shortly after major injury, there is a limited analgesic period allowing the body to flee the area of danger, later on, emerging pain compels the body to rest and supports recuperation.	0.9732760276455537
While acute pain has a certain meaning, chronic pain does not.	1.0257382884269073
It induces a comprehensive suffering including loss of initiative, appetite and vigilance.	0.7422671820916352
It reduces life-quality, often accompanied by depressive moods.	0.966602712228724
Acute pain causes changes in the central nervous system leading to an increased sensitivity of nociception (hyperalgesia).	0.9113624439085328
During healing, the central processing of noxious stimuli is normalised taking minutes to weeks.	0.979788851767978
Sometimes, unknown factors initiate chronification of pain.	0.5978467925545775
Changes on a molecular level in peripheral tissue as well as in the central nervous system induce "cellular early genes" [24], a synthesis of c-fos, c-jun and other proteins favouring the chronification of pain.	1.1256449613560404
All efforts have to be made to depress or interrupt such a development.	0.8556315250742121
One of the first steps to pain prophylaxis in a hospital is an optimal surgical technique: incision, extension, limited tissue damage and minimal invasive surgery should guarantee the smallest impairment of the nociceptive system possible.	1.1329733860259952
However, nociceptive input is intense and of long duration and leads to central sensibilisation.	1.0820881654496592
Postoperative pain has lost its function as surgery anticipates healing.	0.7606333563981117
Pain induces a reduction of ventilation, circulation, digestion and increases the risk of other disorders.	0.9014732780060978
There is need of aggressive pain treatment for humanitarian reasons and for reasons of late sequelae like permanent pain and increased reduction of function [10].	0.9272691962044166
This is of pivotal importance in patients with amputations or sympathetic reflex dystrophy (SRD).	0.8264560975304549
Antinociception is best provided by regional anaesthesia technique with a combination of local anaesthetics and opioids which results in better outcome [2, 12].	1.0278039334415754
Hence, regional anaesthesia techniques are strongly indicated in those patients.	1.068075130105469
Good antinociception may be even more important than it is assumed today.	0.9721309368019035
Anand [1] demonstrated a lower morbidity and mortality in 45 newborns undergoing cardiothoracic surgery, when general anaesthesia was performed with high-dose sufentanil versus halothane supplementary doses of morphine.	1.1275426241947277
Anaesthesiologists have to reconsider the quality of general anaesthesia: the antinociception of their regimen.	1.0329905917597824
In diagnostics of erectile dysfunction there are different simple or large-scale procedures available.	0.8828687383210571
Refering to a three-step-scheme that makes difference in the diagnostics in I. non-invasive, II.	1.1744878549785
invasive procedures the current diagnostic measures will be explained.	0.8007989579427655
To the non-invasive measures do account the extensive patients history taking including the sexual history and the psychological diagnostics, the physical examination and laboratory screenings.	1.0984770421576568
The semi-invasive procedures include the intracavernous injection test with vasoactice substances, the doppler sonography and duplex or color duplex sonography, the corpus-cavernosum-electromyogram (CC-EMG) and other neurophysiological examinations.	1.082783481584226
The third invasive step contains the dynamic infusion pharmacological cavernosography and cavernosometry (DICC) and the selective pharmacological phallo-arteriography.	1.019080867820804
The procedures of this step are essentially limited to patients with erectile dysfunction who are planned for surgical interventions.	0.9289393624918658
Technological advances in the last two years in mammalian nuclear transfer techniques and the establishment of human embryonic stem cell lines formed the background of the International Workshop on "Embryonic Stem Cells and Nuclear Transfer Strategies" organized at the Gene Center, Munich, September 1999.	1.0453093325723375
The aim of the meeting was to bring together scientists working in the stem cell field and those working on somatic nuclear transfer techniques to discuss the present status and prospects of both technologies for basic and applied research and future use in medicine and livestock breeding.	1.1044266702273593
"Biology of Embryonic Stem Cells", "Nuclear Transfer Strategies", and "Stem Cell Differentiation - Cell Therapy" were the main topics of the meeting.	1.3015087938373238
It became clear that we are far from understanding the processes involved in stem cell self-renewal and differentiation and the mechanisms resulting in reprogramming of nuclei from somatic cells after transfer into enucleated oocytes.	0.8983191151701189
However, data were presented that showed the enormous potential of the embryonic stem cell technology for tissue transplantation in the future.	1.2023222355697822
Before any use of this technology in combination with any cloning technology for human cell therapy will be possible, further research including animal models and stem cell differentiation approaches in culture (i. e., identification of differentiation factors, selective differentiation strategies, reporter gene assays) is necessary to understand the basic principles of pluripotent stem cell differentiation and the mechanisms involved in reprogramming somatic cell nuclei.	1.0956097148147756
Certain fractures and/or dislocations of the femoral head are known to cause arterial injury and result in post-traumatic osteonecrosis.	1.0700517913670498
However, the more complex etiology of non-traumatic osteonecrosis is multifactorial and includes chemotherapy, radiotherapy, thermal injuries, and especially coagulopathies, which are now commonly observed in these patients.	1.2203219803923837
Intravascular coagulation with fibrin thrombosis begins in the capillaries and sinusoids of the intraosseous microcirculation, and residual venous thrombosis is more likely to occur if there is coexistent hypofibrinolysis.	1.0537891003103943
The aim of our study was to investigate the influence that serum of patients with preeclampsia has on t-PA and PAI-1 expression from human endothelial cells.	0.9018653369047295
For this purpose, we cultured human endothelium cells, gained from umbilical veins, for 24 h with sera of 7 patients with HELLP syndrome and 12 patients with preeclampsia.	1.0999020678850322
The sera of 12 normotensive pregnant patients and 9 non-pregnant women were used as controls.	0.8936655962479979
We then determined t-PA and PAI-1 levels by ELISA, both in the maternal serum and in the supernatant of the endothelial cell cultures.	0.9161559099075904
While t-PA levels were significantly higher in the serum of patients with preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome than in the control group (median: 8.0 ng/ml and 6.2 ng/ml vs 3.9 ng/ml and 3.1 ng/ml), levels of PAI-1 did not show any significant disparity among the different groups.	1.2014561139400564
The supernatant of the endothelial cell cultures demonstrated significantly elevated levels of both t-PA (P<0.001) and PAI-1 (P<0.01) when stimulated with serum gained from patients with preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome.	0.9689015290033516
The increased expression of t-PA and PAI-1 from human endothelium cells after stimulation with the serum of preeclamptic patients must be considered as a sign of increased endothelial cell activation.	0.9378062404578265
Postoperative pain relief can be achieved by several methods, including the use of systemic opioids and regional anaesthesia with intrathecal or epidural opioids or local anaesthetics.	1.1183471162350345
On-demand analgesia using a PCA (patient-controlled analgesia) system is regarded as the ideal option for systemic opioid analgesia.	1.0124743058985208
While PCA devices are not yet commonly used in all recovery units, the use of repetitive boluses on demand is still the most frequent form of administration in postoperative pain therapy.	1.130416535853511
The objective of the present study was to show if continuous infusion of the opioid tramadol could produce better analgesia than repetitive administration of boluses.	1.1228715443596853
In a study under double-blind conditions 135 ASA I and II patients were assigned at random to group I (infusion group) or group B (bolus group) when they first requested pain treatment after abdominal surgery.	1.097031792108559
The patients in group I received an initial intravenous loading dose of 100 mg tramadol, followed by an infusion of 12 mg/h tramadol for 24 h; if necessary, repeated boluses of 50 mg tramadol were given.	1.14016528516876
In group B the patients received a placebo infusion instead of the tramadol infusion; otherwise, the procedure was the same.	1.2916236185501495
Pain relief was monitored by means of a VAS (visual analogue scale) up to 6 h after surgery.	1.0710230037638506
We investigated the retrograde assessment of analgesia by the patients after 6 h, how often repetitive boluses were required, and the amount of analgesics administered in 6 and 24 h. Results.	1.2099362905638602
The pain relief was assessed as excellent or good by 76.5% of group I and 65.6% of group B; 19.1% of group I and 26.9% of group B assessed the analgesic effect as satisfactory; 4.4% of group I and 7.5% of group B complained of insufficient analgesia.	1.3452934120181186
In group I 69.2% requested only one or no repetitive bolus, compared with 40.3% in group B, while two or more boluses were demanded by 30.8% in group I and 59.7% in group B.	1.2568365091100664
The average analgesic consumption after 6 h was 223.5 +/- 53.7 mg tramadol in group I and 176.6 +/- 63.1 mg tramadol in group B, respectively.	0.9743906905753074
After 24 h it was 449.5 +/- 66.0 mg tramadol in group I and 201.6 +/- 83.9 mg tramadol in group B.	0.9343421508947793
While the consumption during the first 6 h was comparable, from then on the consumption in group I increased significantly.	1.1820520144366733
Side effects were reported by 25% in both groups.	1.2023050385047434
They were clinically irrelevant and did not necessitate termination of the clinical trial in any case.	0.9323620964043147
During the study period pulse and blood pressure remained within the normal range and did not show any significant changes.	1.019548526150409
The fact that the patients in group I requested far fewer repetitive boluses than those in group B and the assessment by the patients led to the conclusion that treatment in the infusion group is better than that in the bolus group.	1.3142164122854845
Concerns that a significantly higher consumption of analgesics would cause unwanted side-effects have proven unfounded.	0.9038986246205787
Six hours after surgery, when analgesia was evaluated by the patients, there was no significant difference between the two groups.	0.95713214780529
Not until the maintenance infusion had been administered for a further 18 h, was the tramadol consumption within the infusion group significantly higher.	1.0939429784699568
Thus, we should consider continuing unreduced administration of the maintenance infusion 6 h after operation.	1.2579481149414866
The concept of tuberculid was introduced by Darier in 1896.	0.67827591923552
In contrast to "true" cutaneous tuberculosis, properties of the tuberculids were explained by an hyperergic response to myobacteria or their fragments released from a different site of manifest or passed tuberculous infection.	0.9560969713259859
Key features include a strongly positive tuberculin skin test, evidence of concomitant manifest or past tuberculosis, and prompt response to antituberculous therapy The inability to culture M. tuberculosis or to demonstrate it microscopically from lesional biopsies, together with reports on tuberculid-like eruptions after BCG vaccination, supports this concept.	0.9310782032198448
Clinical manifestations are lichen scrophulosorum, papulo-necrotic tuberculids and erythema induratum of Bazin.	0.7055530138272723
The existence of tuberculids has been questioned, however, because the clinical and histological appearances are not always specific.	1.338134741148183
An increasing number of case reports on tuberculids, new immunological tests and molecular biology-based techniques for the detection of mycobacteria have shed new light on the tuberculid concept.	0.9449316114233698
Case Report: A 20-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital because of a pneumothorax.	1.1782137295727522
A secondary amenorrhea was coexisting.	0.428436766735285
On the abdominal wall and in the anogenital area a maculopapular exanthema was visible.	0.9046449680669203
Chest X-ray and HR-CT showed a interstitial lung disease with high probability of histiocytosis X which was confirmed by biopsies of lung and skin tissue.	1.0060027793323791
The cause of amenorrhea was a histiocytic infiltration of the pituitary stalk.	0.8551258731326171
Conventional "consensus-treatment" for adults with vinblastine, prednisone and etoposide did not prevent relapsing bilateral pneumothoraces.	0.8858207660801486
Treatment was successful with the protocol as proposed by the international study for children.	0.898233984343308
This treatment is characterized by higher dosage and combination with 6-mercaptopurine.	0.9512205835548591
The prognosis of patients with malignant diseases requiring treatment on intensive care units is poor.	1.1614271704810875
The hospital mortality for mechanically ventilated patients ranges from 70-90% in patients with solid tumors to 75-90% in patients with hematological malignancy and up to 95% in patients after bone marrow transplantation.	1.2047629123427042
The number of patients referred to intensive care units is however increasing, due to improvements in the general treatment of malignant diseases.	1.1336529005525326
This results in controversies about the utilization of intensive care treatment in these patients.	1.0228459355450605
Since the individual outcome can not be predicted prior to initiation of intensive care therapy a general refusal of intensive care treatment seems not justified.	0.9593969135625773
A reevaluation of the patients status after initiation of intensive care treatment based on predefined criteria may however be useful in the decision about continuing intensive care measures.	1.1308425138869496
Patients requiring mechanical ventilation after bone marrow transplantation will not survive if prolonged treatment with vasopressors is necessary and/or sustained hepatic and renal failure is present.	0.9812646138830033
For these patients a withdrawal of further life support may be considered.	1.0351157102267357
Intensive care treatment should be continued in patients not fulfilling these criteria and treatment results are comparable to those in patients without malignant diseases.	1.1552001518968775
For other patients with malignant diseases the use of a new score system developed for patients with cancer can be helpful in the clinical decision making.	1.235330357075859
On the basis of a solution-oriented marital therapy, the different within-session effects of four different types of questions in systemic therapy (lineal, strategic, circular, and reflexive), as described by Tomm (1989), were tested.	1.2324505350719814
In this single case study, the method of plan analysis (Caspar 1989) was used to categorize the client's reactions to the four types of therapeutic questions.	1.1503482323521523
Lineal and strategic questions were expected to have a stabilizing and restraining effect on the system (i.e.	0.8317216894609509
the client, the clients' interaction, and the therapeutic interaction), whereas circular and reflexive questions were expected to open the system for change.	1.3648672027627986
Interestingly this hypothesis was only supported for the wife, who had the role of the identified client in the therapy and demonstrated a much stronger motivation for change.	1.2021235787039497
For the husband, who preferred the role of a cotherapist and demonstrated only little motivation for change, results were not as predicted.	1.035835612765568
Some of his reactions were even opposite to the expected therapeutic effects.	0.8333739247479818
Therefore, it is suggested that an interaction effect between questions and the motivation for change can be assumed.	1.246306540547726
Prerequisites for experimental study designs are extremely difficult to realise under prehospital emergency conditions.	0.7373382302309863
Results obtained in animal experiments always need validation with prehospital or inhospital patient studies.	0.8142033338700309
Investigations related to emergency medicine are, however, an ethical obligation on behalf of the patient.	1.0405705840410477
A retrospective analysis of the available literature should be considered a prerequisite for prospective randomised and controlled studies.	1.259500152680133
Frequently, a pilot study or feasibility trial needs to precede the actual study.	0.9779157740858232
Informed consent must be obtained for all patient studies.	0.7397504516463929
However, under emergency conditions informed consent cannot always be obtained due to unconsciousness, etc.	1.0102527300774167
Nevertheless, the following principles should be observed: (a) randomised studies are essential, even in emergency medicine; (b) they are ethically acceptable if the treatment provided for the study group is at least equivalent to the therapy for the control group; ( c) only these preconditions guarantee that the patient always receives treatment in accordance with the standard of treatment.	1.3930411807615972
If the patient is unconscious or otherwise unable to give informed consent, the principle of deferred consent is acceptable.	0.9690693824633122
The deferred consent principle should be carefully documented.	0.6799868517558703
A prospective randomized study represents the gold standard for an investigation, even under emergency conditions.	1.1241092478747399
There are different principles of randomization: telephone or telefax randomisation, etc.	0.7234674267897953
Emergency medicine investigations need to be completed within a reasonable time frame which should, as a rule, not exceed 2 years.	1.2508561946552692
Otherwise, too many items might change without being noted.	0.9393048788878122
Curative treatment and the intention to treat are terms employed by ethics committees.	0.9119099905956701
If an investigation does not bear in itself additional risk factors, it does not necessarily have to be brought before the ethics committee.	0.9686396803763782
If, however, for example, the effect of obtaining blood samples is investigated separately for research purposes, the patient needs to be informed and sign the respective agreement.	1.1719873086379207
In Germany the ethics committees have agreed to accept their respective decisions.	0.8709460975861787
For multicentre and multinational studies, however, the ethics committees also need to accept decisions made by non-German ethics committees.	0.9142635647992597
Not all therapeutic principles can serve as the basis of prospective randomized studies because they need to be considered the present standard of care (e.g., endotracheal intubation, etc.).	1.0517278099176341
Nevertheless, the feasibility of a study should be assessed according to the 1-3 rating proposed by the American Heart Association.	1.1065792571362538
In principle, the overall emergency physician protocol does not fulfill scientific requirements.	0.9818847547465499
For all studies, particularly in the prehospital setting, an independent observer should be involved for documentation purposes.	1.036281497825368
Scores can be of importance for investigating different treatment regimens.	0.9421817758928664
Biases in emergency medicine studies focus on the variability of EMS, personnel qualifications, etc.	0.7866997600629746
This is in part why it is extremely difficult to prove efficacy and efficiency in emergency medicine.	0.9388888351343595
The results of emergency medicine investigations should be published in suitable journals, i.e., journals with a reasonable rating.	1.0918420571771517
New antifungals for oral therapy have improved the chances of healing onychomycoses.	0.8443187142659306
Nevertheless, in daily practice the failure rate is 20-30% both with itraconazole and terbinafine.	1.2615525662071858
In our investigations for the fungicidal effects of terbinafine, we could show that the same strain of Trichophyton rubrum or T. mentagrophytes in the rest period needs 1000 times higher concentration of terbinafine (2,0 to 0,002 µg/ml) for complete fungal killing as in the growth phase.	1.1800365901995409
Thus resting fungi in the nail are not harmed, and if the concentration of terbinafine is lower than the MIC for the fungi, they can cause a relapse.	1.1411038972046914
Itraconazole is a fungistatic agent.	0.587317780358084
Its concentration in the nail plate must be higher than the MIC for the causative fungi for a long time - 10 to 12 months.	1.1639102912785206
The usual short-term treatment of onychomycosis over 3 months can be insufficient in individual cases such as patients with disorders, e.g.	0.9028393086887604
circulatory disorders or slowed nail growth.	0.587030575826435
This paper presents an algorithm for automatic switching between atrial tracking and nontracking pacing mode based on a "4 out of 7" concept: if 4 out of 7 atrial intervals are sensed below a critical value, mode switching (MS) is automatically performed.	0.9890401744727111
The technical solution in Medtronic Kappa 700 dual chamber devices is explained together with an evaluation of advantages and possible limitations.	0.8281785860044959
The "4 out of 7" algorithm offers a quick MS; by the addition of a "blanked flutter search" algorithm integrated into this concept, the detection of atrial flutter is facilitated in a wider range of programmed AV intervals.	1.015358884596696
With the increased rapidity of MS and sensitivity towards atrial flutter detection, there is also an increased propensity to switch to the nontracking mode in case of short atrial runs and frequent premature atrial beats.	1.039750823018084
Therefore, to optimize the MS function, programming of the device (e.g., activation of a time delay before MS) should be carried out individually with respect to the intrinsic rhythm and arrhythmia of the patient.	1.185486824315304
Possible interactions between different programmable parameters should also be taken into consideration.	0.7535668630651166
Some guidelines are presented in this paper.	0.743707213131754
Finally, the use of extended stored diagnostic data seems to be crucial to evaluate pacemaker performance, incidence of atrial arrhythmias, and (as far as possible) confirmation of the stored data themselves by assessment of stored intracardiac electrograms.	1.103787836603484
Between 1983 and 1991 ten patients with chronic frontal sinus disease underwent frontal osteoplastic flaps with fat obliteration.	0.9689703854569514
In order to judge operative success on a long-term basis all patients were called for postoperative follow-up.	1.013497392526357
They then completed a questionaire, in which they were asked about postoperative complaints.	1.1466211384321052
Additionally, sinuses were examined by computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MR).	0.9349090915797672
Among the patients evaluated seven had no complaints, and no evidence of disease could be found by medical examination.	1.2335721903569337
CT scans showed complete obliteration of the frontal sinuses in all patients.	0.9784381467185166
In these patients, two-thirds of the fat had been replaced by connective tissue.	0.8014512742968791
MR was used in an attempt to show evidence for suppurative disease in the frontal sinus, but the MR images failed to correlate with symptoms.	1.223084184315497
Additional results could not be obtained when compared to CT.	0.8419241729368188
Overall operating success could only be determined by clinical assessment and confirmed the value of the frontal osteoplastic flap with fat obliteration.	1.0388602513938074
The objective of our trial was to evaluate the significance and usefulness of sentinel lymphadenectomy (SLNE) for the staging of regional lymph nodes in breast cancer patients.	1.1113769202258683
The study presented illustrates the method and our results.	0.9636415242990755
As has been documentated for melanoma, the first lymph node [sentinel node (SLN)] to receive lymphatic drainage from a primary tumor is the expected first site of lymph-node metastasis.	1.097614391360321
The database presented includes 12 patients with operable breast cancer and clinically negative lymph nodes.	0.8476269707687714
In 11 cases the described method was applicable.	0.8817353983592625
In only one case was there no correlation between the histology of the SLN and the axillary specimen.	1.000640339432371
Successful completion of examination of a large number of patients with a long follow-up has the potential of reducing the number of axillary dissections and of significantly reducing morbidity in the majority of breast cancer patients.	1.2006559292308623
Background: Information on the extent and degree of the thermal effect produced is of great importance for control of the laser dosage in laser thermokeratoplasty (LTK) and for postoperative follow-up.	1.2442854986874983
We investigated on acute LTK effects which information images obtained by optical low coherence tomography (OCT) offer compared to those obtained by polarization microscopy.	0.9741486028744725
In cases with protected left main stenosis by previous bypass surgery or as an emergency intervention in patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is performed as an alternative treatment strategy to bypass surgery.	1.1068949695991315
A review of 262 left main angioplasties revealed a procedure-related mortality in cases without protection of the left main coronary artery of 9.1% (4/44), in cases with partially protected left main stenosis by collaterals to either left coronary artery of 4.8% (1/21) and 0.5% (1/187) in cases with nonobstructed bypass grafts to either left coronary artery.	1.3297152012405917
Coronary angioplasty of an unprotected left main coronary artery, had an unacceptably high procedure-related mortality rate and should therefore not be performed even in cases of emergency intervention.	1.0801008496878506
The risk stratification of the procedure can be evaluated by the proposed grading of left main artery protection.	1.1678102397573826
Hypocalcemia is a relatively uncommon reversible cause of congestive heart failure.	0.7810561737376419
There are a few reports of hypocalcemic children who developed congestive heart failure associated with hypoparathyroidism.	0.9406085432228949
In all these patients, however, cardiac failure did not occur before the age of nine years.	1.1767138297788946
In addition, other striking noncardial manifestations of hypoparathyroidism, e.g., convulsive seizures, had been present prior to cardiac symptoms.	1.1764012188022155
In this publication, Nager syndrome was analyzed in the literature and six patients from our clinic were evaluated in relation to symptoms, etiology and pathogenesis.	1.176007074784089
The diseases to be considered when making a differential diagnostis are pointed out.	0.9634246270703809
Clarification of the etiology is still pending.	0.8976918494334142
Molecular genetic research in these patients is possibly the key for new findings.	0.9538421176627109
A case report illustrates the results of interdisciplinary treatment by the surgeon and orthodontist.	1.2291742728546515

The results of ankle arthroplasty have generally been disappointing compared to other forms of arthroplasty.	0.9240619125549435
The present survey of results of ankle arthroplasty deals with the anatomical, the kinemasiological the biomechanical and the biological features of the ankle joint.	1.061403212183165
These features all seem important prerequisites for a successful total ankle prosthesis design.	0.8042997771942222
From the study of the results displayed in the literature and those of my own series it can be stated that a modern ankle arthroplasty should respect the normal anatomy and kinemasiology.	1.1696865628618607
Biomechanically it should work as a normal ankle joint i. e. cylindrical mobility, congruency and a possibility for normal torque within the ankle mortise.	0.9461197101664243
The prosthesis components should only be fixed in solid subchondral bone, and preferably without cement.	0.9194576835579608
Only compressible forces should act at the bone-prosthesis interface.	0.8294838989098129
The axis of the ankle joint as well as of that of the hindfoot should be aligned to normal.	1.2471370554800874
Meticulous surgery and special guide instruments are absolute necessities.	0.7412752767918196
Restoration of muscle power and gait postoperatively are essential for a good and lasting result.	0.948025117947757
The indication for ankle arthroplasty is mainly cases of osteoarthritis (primary or traumatic) and rheumatoid arthritis.	1.0355562196018147
Contraindications are talus necrosis, Charcot joints, extreme osteoporosis, severe arteriosclerosis, and very aggressive arthritis.	0.9444360000009181
Mental disorders and neurological disorders may also be contraindications.	0.8274223393791329
Furthermore, the patients should agree not to perform sports involving jumping and running or other ankle demanding activities.	1.1245370389492746
The average annual failure rate should not exceed 1 % if these recommendations are followed.	1.1521804518369871
Elbow flexion plays a key role in the overall function of the upper extremity.	1.0122504038261129
In the case of unilateral complete brachial plexus lesion, restoration of elbow flexion will dramatically increase the patient's chances of regaining bimanual prehension.	0.9611232305971881
Furthermore, depending on the type of reconstruction, stability of the glenohumeral joint as well as some supination function of the forearm can be restored to a varying degree at the same time.	1.0394623083431989
Depending on the level of brachial plexus lesion and/or reinnervation, different reconstructive procedures are available.	0.9567323382269205
In order to select the best treatment option for the patient it is necessary to known the extent of the lesion of the brachial plexus and/or ventral upper arm muscles, to time the operation appropriately, to be aware of all treatment possibilities and to recall the special problems of tendon transfer for brachial plexus patients.	1.1690021147411613
Our concept is based on our experience with more than 1100 patients presenting a brachial plexus lesion between 1981 and 1996 and treated in our institution.	1.019036438404973
There were 528 operative revisions of the brachial plexus.	0.6490196804239108
Some 225 patients underwent secondary muscle/tendon transfers.	0.7231617343897777
In 35 patients elbow flexion was reconstructed by bipolar latissimus dorsi transfer (n = 10), triceps-to-biceps transfer (n = 15), modified flexor/pronator muscle mass proximalization (n = 6) and multiple-stage free functional muscle transfer after intercostal nerve transfer (n = 4).	1.1506287155262211
The official German guidelines for prevention of intravascular-device-associated infections were published by the Bundesgesundheitsamt, now called the Robert-Koch-Institut, 12 years ago.	0.744297936113815
The recently published official "Guidelines for Prevention of Intravascular-Device Associated Infections" of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are categorized according to scientific evidence.	0.6751515333127941
The American guidelines are very detailed and differ in some aspects from the offical German guidelines.	0.5075416672039958
The purpose of the present paper is to inform the German-speaking anaesthesiologist about the official CDC guidelines and to provide an update on the prevention of intravascular-device-associated infections.	0.9059571021381764
We assessed the interindividual diagnostic variance of 39 experienced arthroscopists by the Kappa Cohen interobserver variation analysis using videotapes of eight different patients with different diagnoses.	0.8625205851490472
Arthroscopically normal findings showed a relatively acceptable interobserver correlation.	0.8222319525807441
Pathological changes, in contrast, often showed very little correlation, especially in the synovial membrane of the suprapatellar recess, in the cartilage of the femoropatellar groove and the posterior cruciate ligament.	1.3155413201977528
In patellar alignment there was also great interobserver variation.	0.8760000974730069
Clinical relevance: When comparing arthroscopic findings with other imaging techniques the above results should be taken into account.	0.8793694386481344
Furthermore, these results will affect the significance of medical expertise based only on pictures.	1.2603531803176675
In addition, medical cost billing, which is based on arthroscopic findings, has to take into account that a wrong diagnosis is possible and therefore charges will be wrong.	1.3387131806578518
Squamous metaplasia can be demonstrated in about 4% of all invasive carcinomas of the breast.	1.4203838071493013
Primary squamous cell carcinomas of the breast are rare, since they occur in less than 1% of all primary invasive breast carcinomas.	1.2634526836677837
In order to classify a breast tumor as a primary squamous cell carcinoma one must exclude an epidermal origin, especially from the nipple region and the possibility of metastatic infiltration of the breast by a squamous cell carcnoma from a different location.	1.1813293428993152
Causative and formal pathogenesis of primary squamous cell carcinoma of the breast is not clear.	1.0002855290956998
A pluripotent embryonal stem cell origin is discussed, considering the phylogenetic descent of the mammary gland from skin appendages.	0.7667614962208198
Squamous metaplasia is also suggested to be a precursor of squamous cell carcinoma.	0.9710126813557409
Here endocrine stimulation and chronic inflammation may both play an inductive role.	0.8401250233110248
The number of published cases of squamous cell carcinomas developing years and decades after implantation of silicon prostheses has increased in recent years.	0.9411159675121925
These tumors probably develop on top of squamous metaplasia induced by the inflammatory pseudocapsule.	0.8525119528051752
The limited success of thrombolytic therapy and the high percentage of patients who have to be excluded from lysis has resulted in the alternative application of primary PTCA in acute myocardial infarction.	1.127831656342964
Randomized studies so far available have shown a significant decrease of hospital mortality by primary PTCA as compared to thrombolysis.	1.0643495067784954
Adjuvant stent implantation and a wider administration of glycoprotein IIA/IIIB inhibitors may further reduce mortality.	0.8449794919650553
For logistic and financial reasons however, not all patients with acute myocardial infarction can benefit from this therapeutic approach in spite of the high density of health care in Germany.	1.2729430385401765
Primary PTCA in acute myocardial infarction should be left to experienced centres and investigators.	0.6771039413585724
Of utmost importance is a reduction of the present "onset-to-opening" times by information campaigns, an improved triage, use of transportation times for pre-hospital lysis and improved thrombolytic agents.	1.0805656258575178
Some 245,000 sporting accidents occur yearly in Switzerland.	0.6705072719702302
The social accident costs amount to approximately 1.8 billion francs per year.	0.8904630590832718
Every second sporting accident occurs during a ball game.	0.7023445809169635
For the shown sporting activities, distortion is the most common type of injury among adults and contained fractures are most common in children.	1.056503773021159
As is to be expected, the number of accidents has grown along with the exploding popularity of snowboarding and in-line skating.	1.1006357918756133
These new sporting activities show no unknown injury patterns which would demand new treatment methods.	0.7920396880496919
Abstract:  The combination of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows the localization and functional characterization of the somatosensory and motor cortex.	0.9794942084759847
However, this method is technically pretentious and time consuming.	1.2949853358236334
Therefore, functional imaging is still not established as routine procedure in neurosurgery.	1.3803017835477307
The aim of the presented study was the development of a protocol, which allows the integration of functional MEG data into presurgical planning and intraoperative navigation, as a routine method.	1.4408266515806871
We report on a 15-year-old girl and her relatives with typical features of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIII.	1.0279052567451068
Main symptoms of this disorder are fragile skin, easy bruisability, joint hypermobility, features suggesting premature aging, and periodontal disease with early loss of teeth.	1.0042291428815981
The inheritance of this type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is autosomal dominant.	0.7499497747028225
The biochemical and genetic defects have not yet been elucidated.	0.9045011614098489
The acute liver failure (ALF) is a complex syndrome resulting from loss of synthetic and metabolic functions of the liver.	1.020664505092638
Despite recent advances in intensive care medicine patients with severe ALF have a very high mortality and the orthotopic liver transplantation still remains the only proven effective treatment of ALF.	1.1181475212326346
Numerous attempts have been made to improve survival by using various extracorporeal support techniques, but none of these therapeutic approaches was able to increase the survival rate.	1.143124201078468
Liver support systems based on detoxification procedures only could not influence the deleterious course of the disease.	0.7939024683298945
It is certain that an ideal liver support system should be capable to fulfil the liver's essential synthetic and metabolic functions as well as detoxification and excretion.	0.8593623909002943
Over the last years the development of hybrid liver assist devices has aimed at replacing these liver functions and therefore might give an advantage over earlier systems based on detoxification techniques only.	0.9411606443584479
This article gives a short review of the various liver support systems and focuses then on the hybrid liver support systems, their construction and the remaining problems after the first clinical applications.	1.1334466363521438
After a latency period of 20 years, in a 39-year-old Austrian citizen of Chinese origin, a surgically removed rectal carcinoma, as well as the neighboring chronic inflammatory rectal mucosa with various degrees of dysplasia and one positive neighboring lymph node, showed helminthiasis in the histopathological examination, convincing us of a link between carcinoma and chronic helminthiasis.	1.115714216706193
Whereas the etiological context between chronic infection by Schistosoma haematobium and endemic frequent urinary bladder carcinoma is considered a matter of fact, whether of not the incidence of intestinal carcinoma is increased in connection with chronic intestinal schistosomiasis is controversial.	1.0256952759739737
The etiological and pathogenetic link between helminthiasis and carcinoma should be considered in the same way as for other related inflammatory large-bowel diseases.	0.9950244799697576
In the sequence chronic inflammation - severe dysplasia, the formation of carcinoma could possibly occur.	1.1238238264123472
Besides a survey of trematodes parasitology and pathology, the link between rectal carcinoma and Schistosomiasis japonicum is pointed out by means of appropriate literature investigations.	0.8889199526877769
Rupture of the carotid artery wall is a very rare postoperative complication.	0.9401911455325969
Mainly ruptures of vein patches are described in the literature.	0.6620769860204441
This paper reports on a 51-year-old patient with elective endarterectomy of the left internal carotid artery using V-Y technique.	1.1660375864629478
On day 8 after operation, the carotid bulb ruptured.	0.8853066184283745
The suture line was not involved.	0.5610112556375784
The rupture was due to local wall necrosis, as verified by histologic examination.	0.950492136650442
In an emergency procedure the necrotized tissue was resected and repaired using a Dacron patch.	0.9604548907256761
Postoperatively the patient showed paresis of the left recurrent nerve but fortunately did not suffer any other neurological deficit.	1.04588056933606
Myocardial stunning (contractile dysfunction in the presence of normalized perfusion) and myocardial hibernation (contractile dysfunction matching reduced perfusion) have represented separate concepts of viable, but dyssynergic myocardium in the past.	1.0964390262234063
However, in vivo experimental and clinical work suggests that repetitive ischemia due to coronary artery disease may induce a gradual transition between stunned and hibernating myocardium.	1.0660475405166567
Myocardial hibernation itself can result from a spectrum of ischemic conditions ranging from impaired myocardial blood flow reserve to frank hypoperfusion.	0.8124302206933295
With increasing severity and duration of ischemia, degeneration of cardiac myocytes, accumulation of glycogen and cell death ensue.	0.9291717327676794
Additonally, there is an increase of extracellular matrix protein content leading to reparative fibrosis, which in turn limits functional recovery.	1.0451174469141662
In the light of these structural features, the available methods for detection of viable myocardium, in particular dobutamine echocardiography and nuclear imaging techniques, offer complementary rather than contradictory information.	1.1453941629773308
Dobutamine echo has satisfactory sensitivity, excellent specificity, and high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of viable dyssynergic myocardium.	1.057336476620724
While in the past only its predictive accuracy for segmental recovery has been validated, newer data show an improved survival after revascularization if at least four viable dyssynergic left ventricular segments in a 16 segment model can be identified by dobutamine echocardiography.	1.0204854260669607
The complete (low and high dose) dobutamine protocol can elicit several types of contractile responses (sustained improvement in contraction or monophasic response, biphasic response, new wall motion abnormality) which should be interpreted in view of other clinical data including a previous infarction.	1.0987474539890734
The test protocol can be used safely at the end of the first week after myocardial infarction.	1.1499881071343623
If ischemia or viability is documented, revascularization should be performed promptly.	0.8688073452355349
A similar strategy should be followed in the setting of chronic coronary heart disease with left ventricular dysfunction.	0.915371178211612
Since the structural changes of hibernating myocardium are progressive, time to revascularization is critical.	0.8884357097835934
On the other hand, responsible therapeutic planning requires proof of ischemia or viability before initiating a potentially hazardous revascularization procedure.	0.7798916257804751
The coarctation of the aorta is a congenital narrowing of the aorta in the transitional area between the distal aortic arch and the proximal descending aorta.	1.0838082416514911
The coarctation causes an arterial hypertension of the upper half and an arterial hypotension of the lower half of the body.	1.2219260120745952
The indication for operative repair is given because of the hypertension with strain and possible insufficiency of the heart.	1.028320759824635
The resection of the narrowed part of the aorta with end-to-end anastomosis or interposition of a prosthesis brings on the risk of a recoarctation.	1.0323044551487945
After a Vosschulte-aortoplasty a recurrent coarctation is rarely seen.	0.7339559414813657
This method, however, brings on a higher risk of the development of an aneurysm.	1.1561982023555384
In the following it is reported about a patient who underwent an operation due to an aneurysm 22 years after a Vosschulte-aortoplasty.	1.1648651292080099
The aging of the Italian population is an emerging public health priority.	0.7763206724891101
In 2025 Italy is expected to have the highest world median age with nearly half of the population over 50 years old.	1.065862517032755
To avoid an unbearable burden of disease and disability on future generations, we must identify areas for intensive disease and disability prevention programs.	1.1344798508820773
A 14 year old macedonic girl was admitted with recurrent colicky abdominal pain that had lasted for several weeks.	0.8536500368800801
Laboratory check, plain abdominal film and abdominal sonography did not show abnormalitities immediately.	0.8989385843644523
Increasing enzyme parameters though indicated cholestasis.	0.5487207639085876
Endoscopic retrograde choledocho-pancreaticography (ERCP) was performed after abdominal sonography showed a dilatation of the choledochus.	1.0794634855610377
It revealed a common-channel situation (ductus choledochus and pancreaticus) and choledocholithiasis.	0.9289363287176994
Papillotomy and stone-extraction could not remove abdominal pain.	0.7022670048692728
Laparatomy and choledocho-jejunostomy could finally remove the symptoms.	0.6025837076442107
Successful transplantation of autologous chondrocytes for repair of articular cartilage defects requires an undisturbed matrix-synthesis of the transplanted cells.	0.9487441910741545
This, in turn, is dependent on the composition of the synovial fluid (SF) of the respective joint.	1.3581241047279644
We addressed the question whether analysis of a patient's SF can predict the rate of matrix-synthesis of articular cartilage exposed to this SF in vitro.	1.0895481317999745
SF was obtained from 115 patients with disorders of the knee, including gonarthrosis (n = 44), meniscal tears (n = 10), rheumatoid arthritis (n = 53), and reactive arthritides (n = 8).	1.2589663424916298
In the SF, the following parameters were determined: Interleukin-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1-RA, TNF, Insulin-like growth-factor I (IGF-I), IGF-II, IGF-binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2), IGFBP-3 as well as total proteinase activity and total collagenase activity.	1.193487371775471
To assess the effect of SF on the matrix synthesis of articular chondrocytes, bovine cartilage was incubated in the presence of SF, and the rate of proteoglycan synthesis subsequently determined.	1.0260224944851262
In some cases, a monoclonal antibody directed against IGF-I was added.	0.8742633561281081
SF from patients with OA or trauma, respectively, stimulated PG-synthesis of bovine cartilage more markedly than did SF from patients with rheumatic arthritides.	0.901747650409937
On the average, 60 percent of the SF-induced increase of cartilage matrix synthesis could be titrated out by an anti-IGF-I-AB.	0.9943453180353121
The best predictor for the SF-effects on PG-synthesis of exposed cartilage was the proportion of free IGF-I (r = 0.573, p < 0.001, Spearman rank correlation) followed by the SF-concentrations of IGF-I (with a positive sign), IGFBP-3, IL-1, and TNF (all with a negative sign).	1.048597713870777
According to our data, IGF-I is the most important anabolic factor in human SF with respect to cartilage PG-synthesis.	1.0334514780162805
The proportion of free IGF-I seems to be of special importance in this regard.	0.8007487273853036
Low SF-levels of free IGF-I could be identified as a possible risk-factor for a sub-optimal protoeglycan synthesis of chondrocytes exposed to this synovial milieu.	0.9713216694535843
The coincidence between panic disorder and depression is a well known phenomenon.	0.8065014205598191
However, only few studies investigated the coincidence of panic disorder with schizophrenia.	1.267019363356882
This may in part be explained by the fact that both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia may mask the clinical symptoms of a panic disorder.	0.9806071073505982
We report on a female patient suffering both from agoraphobia with panic disorder and paranoid schizophrenia according to ICD-10.	0.9985388323161025
The productive psychotic symptoms responded well to treatment with a low dose of zotepine, whereas the panic disorder was effectively treated with a combined therapy with imipramine and cognitive behavioral therapy.	1.1431051605265643
Although it has to be questioned whether the coincidence between panic disorder and schizophrenia reflects two different diagnostic entities, the occurence of symptoms of a panic disorder in schizophrenia deserve further attention because these may be treated efficiently by a specific pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy.	0.9646613072381277
A 54-year-old female patient with a 10-year history of ventriculoperitoneal shunt resulting from communicating hydrocephalus of undetermined aetiology is reported.	0.9066388383644024
Transient gait disturbances and cerebral infarction at the age of 46 did not lead to further insights into the nature of the disease.	0.9070703571565578
After many years with only occasional disturbances, a distinct organic brain syndrome developed.	0.947581650622375
Thorough examination led to a tentative diagnosis of neurocysticercosis; this was based on the history, liquor diagnosis and cerebral microcalcifications in CT.	1.0640141399184786
Despite the initiation of specific therapy, the patient died of the sequelae of the disease.	1.2422577431823099
At autopsy, characteristic cicatricial residues of mainly basal leptomeningitis were found with collapsed parasitic cysts.	0.8399098382509026
Additional intracerebral mesenchymal-glial reactions were less conspicuous.	0.7037904981265269
Residual ependymitis had caused aqueductal stenosis.	0.546117998604234
Death was due to cachexia, bronchopneumonia and a lung abscess.	0.7358193626563045
The clinical course and morphology of neurocysticercosis are discussed.	1.0441373936727185
The disease has become rare in our country, but is globally the most important parasitic disease of the central nervous system.	1.1423375466929662
The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the incidence, etiology and prognosis of severe connatal anemia in preterm and term children.	1.0365779088243505
All neonates born in the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University of Kiel, were included.	1.0280127768988314
In 18 of 18 367 (0.98 permil) liveborn neonates (birth weight 680-4050 g; 26-41 weeks of gestation), the initial hemoglobin level was below 10 g/dl.	1.078113224117135
In those children with birth weight below 2500 g the incidence was 6.8 permil.	0.9286952706300101
In 17 of 18 cases the cause of anemia could be clarified.	0.9405880630106845
In five preterm babies (28%) an acute fetofetal transfusion and in three newborns a fetomaternal transfusion was responsible for the onset of anemia.	1.0855299395272688
In two cases there was Rh incompatibility, in two cases placental bleeding, and in another two cases fetal tumour bleeding caused the anemia.	1.296245381986801
In one fully developed newborn there was severe disseminated intestinal bleeding of unknown cause.	0.7949590201701701
Another child suffered from EBV infection, and one had trisomy 13 with multiple malformations.	1.0482047976262698
Ten children (55%) had to be resuscitated due to hypovolemic shock.	1.001506507440798
Fifteen children were intubated and ventilated mechanically.	0.6528861955678313
Seven children (39%); (six preterm babies and the newborn with trisomy 13) died between days 1 and 6.	1.0500251544516457
Five of these seven children had to be resuscitated at birth.	0.9170687465658633
Six children (33%) showed evidence of neurologic disease when discharged; five of these were resuscitated previously.	1.1109318194769724
Five children (28%) including three full-term babies were developed normally.	1.0352479887182213
In conclusion, severe anemia with hemoglobin below 10 g/dl is very rare but serious.	1.104735031258364
It seems necessary to optimize primary resuscitation by immediate transfusion and monitoring of central venous pressure by umbilical vein catheter.	0.8712532636420077
The prognosis can be influenced in a positive way.	0.8814471307560281
Diagnosis of bacterial infection and/or sepsis in critically ill patients is a common problem in intensive care medicine.	0.9934314412052627
White blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are often used in the differential diagnosis of infection versus SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome) due to noninfectious causes.	1.1368434921381747
There is a number of non-infectious stimuli to cause leucocytosis and CRP elevation.	0.9505840183667777
In the last 3 years, Procalcitonin (PCT) was determined to be a marker of severe bacterial infection, especially sepsis.	1.353776093799821
PCT appears to have several advantages; it is of non-hepatic (yet unknown) origin and useful in patients with hepatic insufficiency.	1.1076505908203835
There is no PCT-increase in acute graft-rejection, viral disease, and autoimmune disorders.	1.0370342139680182
Some studys showed a prognostic value of PCT in sepsis due to peritonitis and pancreatitis.	0.8189523722378206
PCT appears to be a new and helpful tool in the diagnosis and treatment of critically ill patients.	0.9497110821537393
Further studies are needed to finally established PCT in the daily management of critically ill patients.	0.8143313040260887
At this time significantly higher costs are the major detraction to daily or frequent measurements.	0.9564421588090102
In this retrospective study, the meniscal status of 45 patients with conservatively treated complete anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears is reported.	0.8593956672709616
The ACL injury was initially documented by examination under anesthesia and arthroscopy.	0.8980615843967527
Treatment in all cases consisted of a standard protocol of early rehabilitation and bracing.	1.1401973986026788
The mean follow-up was 8 years.	0.9751365859320882
Twenty-nine (65%) patients showed signs of meniscal pathology at an average of 3 years after the ACL injury during the follow-up period.	1.1739756377213446
Rearthroscopy was performed and showed a higher incidence of medial meniscus tears.	1.0916216163192969
The most common tear of the medial meniscus was the bucket-handle type, followed by the flap tear and the single longitudinal split of the posterior horn.	1.1382239675982602
Secondary reconstruction of the ACL was necessary in 24 patients complaining of the meniscus giving way.	0.9513029549729921
The remaining five patients had rearthroscopy 4 years after the ACL injury and a partial meniscectomy and ACL reconstruction was performed.	1.0411148355125421
Sixteen patients (35% of the overall sample) had no instability complaints or meniscal pathology during the follow-up period, but discontinued their sporting activities.	1.1917852513767926
Results indicate the increasing incidence of meniscal tears during ACL insufficiency.	0.7544056490889308
We recommend that patients with ruptures of the ACL should be investigated for meniscal tears and that early ligament reconstruction of the knee and mensical repair or partial meniscectomy should be considered simultaneously.	1.2164198502716208
Four children, 4 to 10 years old, with chronic uveitis were treated with cyclosporin A (CsA; starting dosage 2 mg/kg per day) and prednisolone.	1.2451975592582334
All children had previously received systemic steroids and/or cytotoxic agents, which resulted either in a poor therapeutic effect or in intolerable side effects.	1.0239560442744828
In one child, suffering from uveitis in combination with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, a complete reduction of intraocular inflammation was achieved.	0.9703267140534462
In a second child treatment resulted in a marked reduction of inflammatory activity with stabilization of visual function, although a temporary increase in the steroid dosage was necessary at one stage.	1.0985057411398813
In the remaining two cases therapy failed to improve the intraocular inflammation.	1.0507503896521568
During the time of treatment, ranging from 11 to 26 months, no serious side effects were observed.	1.0952703562779584
All patients developed moderate hypertrichosis and one child gingival hyperplasia.	0.8235141303834372
In our <\d> experience, cyclosporin A (CsA) combined with low-dose systemic steroids is useful as a therapeutic alternative to steroids alone and to other immunosuppressive agents in severe cases of chronic uveitis in childhood.	1.1381802044257863
Allergic reactions in tattoos are comparatively rare.	0.5800851216747871
In most cases the reactions are caused by different red pigments.	1.0042544984955852
While in the past these reactions have been ascribed to mercury salts (cinnebar) and cadmium sulphide, now synthetic inorganic azo dyes have also been found to be responsible for such reactions.	1.0095242573668994
A 42-year-old man presented with an allergic reaction in the red parts of his tattoos.	0.9869541589360156
Histologically a chronic granulomatous, partly fibrous inflammation with transfollicular elimination of pigment granules was found.	0.809540759836212
Spontaneous regression in a part of the inflammatory reaction was observed, simultaneously with depigmentation and scarring of the overlying skin.	0.8577489392024085
The pigment used for tattooing was found to be an aromatic azo derivative.	1.0024664162505783
In addition to a positive cutaneous reaction to the dye, the patient also showed a positive patch test to Napthol AS, used for the coupling of different dyes in the textile industry.	1.2911650992047
Borrelia burgdorferi specific DNA has been detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in different specimens of patients with Lyme disease (LD).	1.0016576321452892
The aim of the present study is to evaluate PCR-diagnostic of urine specimens regarding rheumatologic diagnosis of Lyme disease.	1.1074944111982796
Urine specimens of 77 patients  (LD, n=34; undifferentiated arthritis (UA), n=25; arthralgia/myalgia (AM), n=18) and 15 controls were investigated.	1.2677812026923203
Flagellin gene  (60 specimens) or OspA-plasmid  (32 specimens) were used as targets.	1.488793803891597
Sensitivity of the flagellin-nested-PCR was 27%, by OspA-nested-PCR only one positive PCR result was found.	1.0572975537932279
Despite of low sensitivity PCR enabled the correct diagnosis of LD in two patients classified as UA.	0.9824043960087917
Therefore, PCR can give valuable hints in single cases if LD is clinically suspected.	1.0361279457526607
Objective: To assess the clinical efficacy of a chemically standardized willow bark extract in the treatment of osteoarthritis.	1.082009354323305
Methods: Willow bark extract, in a dose corresponding to 240mg salicin/day, was compared to placebo in a 2-week, double-blind, randomized controlled trial.	1.143305144159865
The primary outcome measure was the pain dimension of the WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index.	0.8812705367311745
Secondary outcome measures included the stiffness and physical function dimensions of the WOMAC, daily visual analogue scales (VAS) on pain and physical function, and final overall assessment by both patients and investigators.	1.1161018831955314
Results: 78 patients (39 willow bark extract, 39 placebo) participated in the trial.	1.1322153211011297
A statistically significant difference between active treatment and placebo group was observed in the WOMAC pain dimension (d=6.5mm, 95%C.I.=0.2-12.7mm, p=0.047); the WOMAC pain score was reduced by 14% from baseline level after two weeks of active treatment, compared to an increase of 2% in the placebo group.	1.2033982321932668
Patient diary VAS confirmed this result, and likewise the final overall assessments showed superiority of willow bark extract over placebo (patients assessment, p=0.0002; investigators assessment, p=0.0073).	0.9094712152163102
Conclusion: Willow bark extract shows a moderate analgesic effect in osteoarthritis.	1.0135575793809208
Background and methods: The aim of this study was to get more information about the prevalence of chronic pain in different practices of home physicians.	1.0687266484107263
900 patients of five different specialists (general medicine, internal medicine, neurology, orthopaedics, surgery) in the german town Bochum were investigated with a questionnaire about chronic pain.	1.1629475200935746
Chronic pain was defined as a continuous or intermittend pain of longer duration than six months.	0.9279144480719148
Confusion between syncope and epileptic seizures is a common problem in clinical practice.	0.892175133826347
Recently, new insights into the phenomenology of transient cerebral hypoxia have been gained from video analysis of experimentally induced syncope.	1.0112895392913694
Common elements of syncope include multifocal and generalized myoclonus, tonic body extension, automatisms, vocalizations, eye deviations and hallucinations.	0.8562239964630994
Thus, it is not the presence or absence of these features but their specific character that distinguishes syncope from epileptic seizures.	1.0503412310587388
Other clues for differential diagnosis include precipitating factors, premonitory symptoms and postictal events, such as tongue bites and postictal confusion, which has been identified as the single most powerful factor discriminating syncope from epileptic seizures.	1.0037637331847304
In contrast, incontinence and head injury are common in both conditions.	1.0168071783551142
Investigations such as electroencephalogram, tilt testing and postictal prolactin or creatine kinase levels may aid diagnosis but are never diagnostic in isolation.	0.7998781953491904
In rare cases, hypoxic and epileptic mechanisms may interact within one attack.	0.863910867300218
In the past two decades increasing research efforts have focused on the molecular biology of the cell.	1.0945840801411073
In the beginning, these research activities were purely academic without any direct clinical relation.	0.8436905187048117
A series of important discoveries, initiated particularly by the unravelling of the genetic code and the discovery of the molecular basis of gene expression and genetics, the subsequent identification of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes and finally the description of major mechanisms which induce genetic instability in cells, now indicate the way to many new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.	1.030141553396818
In surgical oncology, these attempts are yielding the first clinical consequences.	1.0670480704300682
Basic aspects of molecular cell biology as far as they are relevant for surgical oncologists are discussed.	0.8709478837892657
The compartment syndrome (cs) is characterized by an increased tissue pressure in a limited space.	1.0850891759441192
Pathophysiologically, it is a multifactorial disease that is potentially induced by an initial trauma and develops according to the existence of cofactors.	1.157233609365689
Cofactors are, for instance, the circulation of the patient and the initial treatment of the impending cs.	1.4040410121046645
In particular, the microcirculation is altered with endothelial destruction, development of a capillary leak, protein loss from intravasal space and the development of an interstitial and intracellular third space.	1.0894214064766168
An impaired drainage of the lymphatic and venous system causes a venous infarction.	0.9323386096888024
An arterial infarction results if the tissue pressure exceeds the arteriolar pressure.	0.7879465105723646
An accompanying ischemia reperfusion mechanism increases the trauma load.	0.7102704842852838
In disadvantageous cases, the patients are in danger of developing a multi-organ deficiency syndrome (MODS) by an uncontrolled inflammatory reaction, by intravasal volume loss and by a myonephropathic systemic reaction.	1.189394190471141
Clinically, the patients suffer a disproportionate amount of pain, followed by neurological signs.	1.0820545173158966
Especially in noncompliant patients, tissue pressure measurement is useful.	0.917719700886302
Resuscitation of the circulation as well as splitting of casts is important.	0.9004602072834662
In case of a manifest cs, dermatofasciotomy has to be performed as an emergency operation.	1.2595456814460846
Even if cs is diagnosed early and fasciotomy is carried out early, the development of sequellae cannot be avoided in every single case.	0.9014766339407708
The object of this study was to evaluate retrospectively the value of open and arthroscopic procedures at mid-term and long-term follow-up.	0.9331576513597238
During the period from January 1980 to June 1997 we performed 247 open (technique: 134 according to Eden-Hybbinette-Lange, 46 according to Weber, 26 according to Putti-Platt, 41 according to Bankart) and 76 arthroscopic (transglenoidal Morgan technique) shoulder stabilization procedures.	1.0105545729299104
The mean follow-up for techniques was: Eden-Hybbinette-Lange 11.1 years (2.9-16.7 years), Weber 5.2 years (2.1-13.0 years), Putti-Platt 7.2 years (2.2-10.6 years), Bankart 1.6 years (0.5-3.2 years), and Morgan 3.5 years (2.8-5.1 years).	1.4721040162510373
We observed that the classic open Bankart procedure has superior results according to the criteria redislocation, range of motion, sports activity, and arthrosis in comparison with the other open procedures.	1.0594476103358987
The results shows that nonanatomical, reconstructive, open procedures are not up to date.	1.0118672576090035
The open Bankart procedure reconstructs the pathology of the anterior glenoid rim only.	0.9764592907303795
The classic open Bankart procedure seems to be the "gold standard" in open shoulder surgery today.	0.8696543734966747
The high redislocation rate of the arthroscopic procedure warrants a more stringent patient selection in the future.	0.9058628073575181
Background: Our study compared the haemodynamic changes after spinal anaesthesia with 2% lignocaine and 0,5% plain bupivacaine.	1.327850630627585
Hyperkalemia is a frequent disturbance.	0.862303130839677
When hyperkalemia is associated with a rapid rise of the serum potassium concentration, the risk of cardiac impairment is greatest.	1.0569415155317354
Usually the cooperative action of several causative factors is required to bring about a hyperkalemia.	0.9067977232393769
Increasing age, diabetes mellitus, disorders of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system, high-dose antibiotics, and immunsuppressive treatments may result in hyperkalemia.	0.9975401854213343
The most important pathogenetic mechanisms are (1) renal insufficiency, (2) hyporeninemic hypoaldeosteronism, (3) tubular disorders, and (4) cellular disorders.	1.0936289384584204
Background: CMV retinitis is the most common opportunistic ocular infection and the main cause of blindness in AIDS patients with a T-helper cell count <= 50/µl.	1.2963778181552736
Cidofovir is a nucleotide analogue with a long half-life time after phosphorylation intracellularly.	0.770635625532306
It is effective against CMV and can be given intravenously and intravitreally.	0.8769176870224968
The aim was to offer an alternative therapy for CMV retinitis to patients who could not receive standard treatment because of contraindications or refused it.	1.0066673302131492
The efficacy and tolerance of intravitreal injections of cidofovir should be evaluated.	0.7896568215382977
A case of multiple eccrine spiradenomata is reported.	0.916193879258026
One of the tumours was histopathologically associated with dermal cylindroma, and immunohistochemical studies showed that the cylindroma cells differentiate towards the secreting portion of the eccrine sweat gland.	1.0101863032626466
The relationship among multiple eccrine spiradenomata, dermal cylindroma and multiple trichoepitheliomata is discussed.	0.781228906030107
In view of the risks of a varicella infection during pregnancy and the more and more observed severe course of infection, varicella infection has to be considered as a serious disease.	1.0461790922583822
The initial antibiotic treatment of bacterial meningoencephalitis has major implications for the course of the disease.	0.7215485407037203
The current spectrum of infectious agents must be considered.	0.729322604847949
Antibiotics have to reach sufficient concentrations in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid for a bactericidal action to occur at the site of infection.	0.9714354279333725
Frequent problems arising in this condition are: (1) the non-observation of listerial infections, (2) the use of antibiotics not sufficiently active against gram-positive bacteria in pneumococal meningitis, (3) the development of meningitis following the use of ciprofloxacin in respiratory tract infections, (4) the hasty change in antibiotic regimens in focal parenchymal infections during delayed response to therapy, (5) the use of bacteriostatic antibiotics, and (6) the delay in administering sufficient antibiotic therapy during fulminate meningococcal meningitis.	1.1301279613984256
Problems arising from these conditions are illustrated by case reports.	0.7442880345527544
Therapy of rheumatoid arthritis with a combination of several disease-modifying drugs aims towards better control of the disease than achievable by monotherapy.	0.9925161619300379
Based on a broad variety of clinical studies, revealing more or less positive results, several combinations have been suggested:...	1.1032392675203366
The management of 178 patients with liver trauma (132 male, 46 female; mean age 34 years (range 3-88) presenting from January 1979 to August 1996 is reviewed.	1.0879991004564835
There were 165 cases of blunt trauma and 13 cases of penetrating injury.	0.8541243567058041
110 cases were classified as simple injuries (grade I or II) and 68 cases as complex injuries (grade III to V).	1.045141093134746
The overall mortality was 32 % (57 patients).	1.2352613509575192
The mortality for true hepatic injury was 15.7 %.	0.8089600272321045
None of the patients with penetrating injuries died.	1.220006529241605
Mortality was inflenced by the type of liver injury and the number of associated injuries.	0.8444186313797432
The postoperative complication rate was 55 %.	0.8763777720054527
The most-frequent postoperative complications related to the hepatic injury were intrahepatic or subcapsular hematoma (12.9 %) and postoperative bleeding (9.6 %).	1.0794311033146131
Intraabdominal abscess formation was seen in 2.8 %.	0.8373371984736454
Operative therapy for liver injuries depends on the grade of the injury.	0.8476841426837247
The majority of liver injuries can be managed by simple techniques, including electrocautery and application of hemostatic agents.	1.0934693951122592
In complex injuries hepatotomy, direct vessel ligation, and debridement of necrotic tissue is the method of choice (Pachter's procedure).	1.0007855334932154
In non-controlled bleeding, perihepatic picking is a standard method.	0.7909594674209968
Aim: The aim of the present study was to investigate knowledge, practices, and opinions on tobacco and oral health among dentists of the Berlin Dental Association using a questionnaire.	1.065780033424872
Materials and methods: Questions focussed on smoking habits, knowledge about oral malignancies and premalignancies and practical approaches to screening for oral mucosal diseases and other associations of tobacco with oral changes.	0.9610381171159548
The questions related to risk factors and behavioural counselling for patients and associated constraints.	1.0157556488504609
Results: Of a total of 4000 questionnaires sent, 483 were received for evaluation (12.1%).	1.0535880196815568
Of respondents 9.5% were regular smokers.	1.201033884595197
The median number of oral malignancies observed was 3.	0.7692763555393951
Knowledge about some associations of oral changes such as wound healing was adequate.	0.7351519460208011
A total of 93.1% of respondents would refer patients with oral lesions.	1.1516649958946996
Only 35% take a regular history of both tobacco and alcohol consumption and 26.6% explain the side effects of tobacco.	0.9850734328492555
Some 73.4% believed that the dentist could play a role in anti-tobacco counselling.	0.8072566723270628
Limiting factors were lack of training and of competence in anti-tobacco counselling.	0.7653783830120305
Conclusions: This study shows that there still is a considerable need for improvement of knowledge and for provision with effective anti-tobacco teaching material.	1.1353560790587525
Since most of the respondents thought that the dentist should play a role in anti-tobacco counselling, adequate programmes in Germany should be inititated and followed up.	0.985034084302775
Background: Last year's pilot study, which examined for the first time a representative group of patients with Chagas disease, showed that in this parasitosis changes in the ocular fundus can be expected in the form of defects of the retinal pigment epithelium.	1.3040452434998997
Examination of more patients in this study should give further information about the character and extent of the alterations found.	1.115407450054727
The posterior luxation of the shoulder joint is a rarely reported and often not recognized lesion in the clinical workday.	1.1032556721453204
The authors present the first case of a posterior luxation of the shoulder joint in combination with an contralateral anterior shoulder joint fracture dislocation.	1.0667280982773748
In that case the authors stress the importance of an exact clinical and radiology diagnostic and the right way to reduce a posterior luxation of the shoulder joint.	0.9785284522430534
Finally they draw the readers attention to operative steps to prevent a reluxation of the shoulder joint.	0.8517057987250254
Magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) has become the most important method in the workup of infantile cerebral complications after primary sonography.	1.0856833453792663
Cerebral MR examination and image interpretation during the infantile period require extensive knowledge of morphological manifestations, their pathophysiological background, and frequency.	1.0196599607487886
The choice of imaging parameters and image interpretation is demonstrated in infarctions and hemorrhages of the mature and immature brain.	0.9283649291902204
A review of the main differential diagnoses is also given.	1.0586732277737445
The relevance of MR spectroscopy and fetal MRI is discussed.	0.775323719650731
Currently laparoscopic surgery is limited by several factors.	0.972088808470625
One of them is the precise handling of optics.	0.8966450463626806
Up to now, in our hospital 52 laparoscopic operations have been done with a voice - controlled robot arm to handle the optics in gallbladder, stomach, large bowel and hernia operations.	1.1308179518480388
The visual field is determined by the surgeon.	0.8886522860819323
In all cases handling of the robot arm was precise and the voice response exact and without technical problems.	0.9208563927657532
Twenty-nine operations were done by one operator as "solo surgeries".	0.8952739405112211
In 20 further cases there was one assistant.	0.8947965366681999
A robot arm can be used successfully without problems by any laparoscopic surgeon in any operating theater.	0.9662935650018076
Urine specimens were collected from 49 persons up to 10 days after abstaining from cannabis use.	0.992615444584997
Urine samples (n = 135) were investigated for free and conjugated 9-carboxy-11-nor tetrahydrocannabinol (THCCOOH) by LC/MS/MS and for free and glucuronidated tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and 11-hydroxy-THC (11-OH-THC) by GC/MS prior to and after enzyme hydrolysis.	1.1830927633126762
Concentrations for free and conjugated THCCOOH were measured with reference to 100 mg creatinine/dL urine.	0.9592436982940524
Cannabis use was classified as light, moderate and heavy according to the current literature.	0.8796601972077466
In all groups chosen free and bound THCCOOH was present in urine samples on the day of the last use and on the next day.	1.0572356248714811
Urine samples from occasional and frequent users generally differed in the amount of THCCOOH and THCCOOH glucuronide.	0.7591092176957797
Within 4-6 days the concentrations of free and glucuronidated THCCOOH in urine samples of heavy users decreased to those ranges present in urine samples of moderate and light users.	0.9934151861752595
In frequent users, THC glucuronide and 11-OH-THC glucuronide could be found up to 1 and 3 days after abstinence, respectively.	0.9652314056597145
In light users, neither THC glucuronide nor 11-OH-THC glucuronide was detectable.	0.8154893417913431
The determination of conjugated THC and 11-OH-THC in addition to free and bound THCCOOH is suggested as an aid in assessing the frequency of cannabis use, but is limited to samples obtained within a few days after the last consumption.	1.0826213497489718
The participation of social work in inpatient psychiatric care is generally considered necessary, but there is a lack of empirical studies in this field.	1.0684843866145846
The analyses presented of a systematic documentation of social work interventions in 2038 cases during an 11-year period demonstrate that social workers are mostly involved in the treatment of chronic and previously treated patients.	1.105406075020723
Interventions in younger patients, most of whom are suffering from psychoses, aim at rehabilitation through activity; in elderly patients with organic or depressive disorders, the major concern is to improve posthospital care; patients with neurotic or personality disorders comprise another group with a chronic course and a relatively poor outcome.	1.1482716819934873
As far as their goals are comparable, social workers and doctors agree on their objectives.	0.9753326409315437
Social workers usually see their own interventions as successful, but patient groups who benefit greatly can be differentiated from groups with poor outcome.	0.9799803766888074
Stiff-man syndrome is a rare disorder of the central nervous system characterized by muscular rigidity and superimposed spasms.	0.9843063846586484
The etiology is still unknown and an autoimmune cause is discussed.	0.9713773988396852
Many differential diagnoses of muscular rigidity and of induration of the skin have to be considered.	0.9979258913213468
A 22 year old patient was admitted under suspicion of a stiff-man syndrome.	0.9571718874797898
He has had developed a painful rigidity of the trunk, starting in the neck.	0.9642382183777343
Massive stiffness of the trunk with pale appearance of the skin and a beginning disorder of swallowing and respiration were observed.	1.0795340233430901
Clinical investigation, EMG, cerebrospinal fluid and laboratory findings were all normal, thus excluding a stiff-man syndrome and other neuromuscular diseases.	0.9678081324543911
Skin biopsy showed typical changes of Buschke's scleredema adultorum, a rare connective tissue disorder of unknown etiology.	1.014939310176617
Therapy with corticosteroide and ciclosporin led to a mild improvement of symptoms.	0.6913441399201136
Although rare, Buschke's scleredema adultorum should be regarded as a differential diagnosis of the stiff man syndrome.	0.9831291621707221
Urogenital infections are established as hazards to male fertility.	0.725972711049662
Various pathophysiological hypotheses have evolved from experimental and clinical studies, facilitating explanation of the effects of bacteria and immunological events on reproductive tissues.	0.9473696014958353
Numerous current studies have identified and evaluated infectious mediators accounting for specific molecular events in urogenital infections.	0.8832076625413027
Valuable studies can be expected to appear in the future due to improvements in diagnostic procedures and new classifications of urogenital infections.	1.0796465532540915
X-ray or CT images allow only a limited three-dimensional orientation in presurgical planning.	1.0157688143361165
Especially for the planning of internal hemipelvectomies with custom-made endoprosthesis and for periacetabular osteotomies a high-grade orientation is necessary.	0.9719442244976523
This orientation is improved by a 3D CT-controlled manufactured 1:1 model of the pelvis.	1.0518003517157544
This enables an exact classification of defect and deformity, planning of resection planes, design of the suitable custom-made implant and simulation of the operation technique as preoperative quality control.	0.9918799342062107
An Ivalon-plug (PDA-plug) has been developed for transvenous closure of patent ductus arteriosus.	0.9914047818966026
It can be introduced into the ductus through standard venous sheaths with a diameter von 8-16 French.	0.9806693332417152
The plug is fixed in its target position by means of four distal (aortal) and two proximal (pulmonary) nitinol struts.	1.0226710658945084
In case of malpositioning the system can be pulled back into and retrieved through the sheath.	0.7515960286167114
In animal experiments endothelialization of the implanted material was demonstrated.	0.8078946798109226
PDA-closure was attempted in 58 patients; the procedure was successful in 57 cases; a residual ductal flow was present in eight patients.	1.0100388802378943
During a follow-up of up to 24 months there were no complications.	1.1097830669351074
Using 8 different monoclonal antibodies, immunohistology was performed on 36 follicular adenomas and on 28 follicular, 34 papillary, 27 medullary and 29 anaplastic carcinomas of the thyroid.	1.0547724655519033
The panel of antibodies was directed against broad-spectrum cytokeratins (pan-CK, antibody lu-5), against basic and acid high-molecular-weight CK of types  1, 5, 10 and 14, against basic ( 5 and 6) and acid high-molecular-weight CK ( 13) and against basic ( 7 and  8) and acid low-molecular-weight CK ( 19 and  20).	1.2190673867553412
With the exception of a large number of anaplastic carcinomas, nearly all other tumours exhibited strong immunoreactivity with antibodies against pan-CK, CK 8 and CK 19.	0.8976947613024705
CK 20 expression was exclusively shown for 2 medullary carcinomas.	0.7704220851413294
Reactivity for high-molecular-weight CK could only, each time focally, be demonstrated for 14 papillary and 2 follicular carcinomas and for 2 anaplastic carcinomas with partial squamous differentiation.	1.030061402903963
Thirteen anaplastic carcinomas were not decorated by any of the CK antibodies applied.	0.784214280280124
CK 7 staining exceeding the staining of individual cells was observed in 26 papillary cancers.	0.8907627616283421
In contrast, such a finding could only be obtained with each one follicular adenoma, medullary carcinoma and anaplastic carcinoma and with 5 follicular carcinomas.	1.1763321954008972
These results confirm earlier studies in that CK 20 expression among thyroid tumours is restricted to the neuroendocrine medullary carcinomas and that in a larger percentage of anaplastic thyroid carcinomas an epithelial phenotype can not be demonstrated even upon using broad-spectrum CK antibodies.	1.0202658638032087
New is the finding that there exist considerable differences between papillary carcinomas and all other non-papillary thyroid tumours regarding CK 7 expression.	0.9279587318890559
This result might be of differential diagnostic value for the distinction of follicular and papillary thyroid neoplasias which sometimes have an overlapping histological pattern.	0.9120805751875016
Purpose: To compare reading speed and reading comfort between closed-circuit television systems (CCTVs) with different image refresh rates.	1.0726961694170531
This surveillance study presents a literature review concerning the very inhomogeneous care emphasis of the acute psychosocial crisis both with respect to crisis insight and therapy methods and to professional responsibility.	0.9572806465144462
In detail general care models of psychotherapeutic crisis intervention are described, as well as disorder- and event-specific concepts and papers on crisis intervention with children, teen-agers, and adolescents of the last 10 years.	0.9971346943765979
In addition, the contributions of the empirical psychotherapy research and their results are presented as far as they are relevant to crisis intervention.	1.0858404320594213
In recent years many different systems for transcatheter closure of an atrial septal defect (ASD) have been developed and tested.	1.0511293209062054
However, all systems presently available have some special disadvantages.	1.2812118236409316
The recently introduced Amplatzer Septal Occluder (ASO), though, appears promising.	1.086485207099244
It is a self-expanding and self-centering double disc made from a Nitinol mesh, which is tightly woven to give mechanical strength.	1.0098142827537269
Both discs are separated by a connecting cylindrical portion.	0.7073965231592625
Its diameter may be chosen, so that it corresponds to that of the ASD.	0.9765447857318643
In the light of recent research findings the inappropriateness of many commonly accepted concepts in psychosomatic medicine is discussed.	0.8453427503018116
They do not stand up to empirical scrutiny.	0.7306099671587567
This applies both to sepcifity models and to duality of body and mind or of illness and health.	0.8047609565861403
The monocausal-psychogenetic view was replaced through a complex interplay of hierarchie somato-psychic circles which are to be integrated into a biosemiotic model.	0.8126141674032573
In terms of the self-object-body system a greater significance is attached to affects in the communication and acting receives an important interactive function.	0.8779655961304696
The effects of the altered theroretical positions on new therapy approaches are discussed.	0.8321479966187064
Perioperative, mostly silent ischaemia in patients with coronary heart disease is difficult to detect by clinical examinations.	1.1471770861140107
Herpes simplex viruses are known to be among the most common disease-causing microorganisms.	1.0130550148998931
Their prevalence can exceed 90% depending on the socioeconomic status of the population.	0.8009024431885595
Since the number of immunocompromised patients has increased because of the increased incidence in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and an increase in organ transplantation, herpes virus infection may have a greater clinical significance.	1.0112048692098616
While treatment of otherwise healthy individuals will not usually cause any clinical problems herpes infection in an immunocompromised patient can have severe consequences.	0.9342557678662406
Additionally, development of viral resistance can be observed that may require alternative drugs in treatment.	1.2052801476689656
We present a case history of a man with a B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia that was associated with a very unusual herpes simplex virus infection in the nasal vestibule.	1.2244423091752685
Possible causes for the development of resistance in herpes infections and the use of famciclovir and forscarnet as two therapeutic alternatives to aciclovir are discussed.	0.8283554155322369
Tumor invasion of the portal vein by ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head is classically known as a criterion for inoperability.	0.835352473627698
Despite improvement in operation techniques for portal vein resection during Whipple's procedure and acceptable mortality and morbidity, in the case of uncertain tumor infiltration vascular resection cannot be recommended in general.	1.0512628890806521
The problem is the preoperative detection of tumor infiltration of the portal vein.	0.9799017645950027
Often the surgeon is confronted with unsuspected macroscopic portal vein infiltration or tumor adhesion during the operation.	0.8104919275926922
Between 1986 and 1995 105 patients underwent Whipple's procedure for ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head in our department.	0.8669432997476209
In eight of these cases partial portal vein resection was performed because of macroscopic tumor infiltration or tumor adhesion.	0.9515450365595317
In all eight cases the preoperative diagnostic procedures with CT and portography did not show any suspicion of tumor infiltration.	1.0361838458010166
In four of the eight cases histological tumor infiltration of all vascular layers was found.	0.9656348940747022
In the others we found no or only adventitial tumor invasion.	0.9456913439480475
The patients without tumor infiltration of the portal vein showed a survival time after surgery of 27.78 months in contrast to 6.67 months in the group with histologically proven tumor infiltration.	1.1697012313415966
Endovascular, intraportal ultrasound (IPEUS), a new diagnostic procedure, can give helpful information regarding portal vein involvement.	1.1452760461631852
Although the IPEUS is not a standard diagnostic procedure it was shown to detect portal vein infiltration with high sensitivity and specificity.	1.0402833083819112
Our results indicate that in such cases where portal vein infiltration has been excluded by IPEUS, patients with macroscopic tumor adhesion do benefit from partial portal vein resection.	0.9951039477832246
Progression in medical research and economic needs require new planning and organization of treatment strategies.	0.8618958142914369
This does also apply for stroke treatment: New pathophysiological knowledge, positive results of thrombolytic therapy and the demostrated importance of early treatment at Stroke Units justify that stroke must be regarded as an emergency.	1.05617960568398
Timing is of utmost importance.	0.5337855106690356
Time-based management serves as a planning model for a new stroke treatment strategy.	0.9166524315754244
The treatment process is divided into three phases: alarming, pre-hospital and in-hospital phase.	0.9940910818959544
The effectiveness of each of these phases is influenced by several variables (personnel, technical equipment, course of the disease, etc.).	0.8837220104825471
Knowledge of each separate phase helps to discover weaknesses, which allows an aimed improvement, e.g.	0.8818695865339198
public education, training of paramedics and medical personnel.	0.8730820953250364
Modern communication systems allow new information transfer, which can help to avoid unnecessary transport of patients.	1.1790644059078952
Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) is a severe complication after heart valve replacement.	1.1011464254081391
Incidence ranges in literature between 0.1% and 2.3% (mean 0.4%) per patient year (pty).	1.3405529369943816
PVE is classified as "early" or "late" (occurence within or after 60 days following heart valve replacement).	1.0765396686848496
In this review we present the clinical outcome of PVE as well as the most common diagnostic criteria (Duke criteria), the potential etiologies and the most frequent bacteria.	1.553246899274771
The spectrum of therapeutical alternatives is discussed and a special attention is directed to the development of prevention standards.	0.9482214565167368
Recently intra-atrial defibrillation has become an interesting alternative to external defibrillation and drug therapy for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.	1.0510274519171907
Low-energy intra-atrial defibrillation can be used to restore sinus rhtyhm f.ex.	1.0490073945278293
after a failed external cardioversion or during an electrophysiologic study when the administration of antiarrhythmic drugs should be avoided.	0.8543598150731239
Additionally this new technique has led to the development of implantable atrial defibrillators for the treatment of selected patients suffering from chronic atrial fibrillation.	0.9890886228102822
Intra-atrial defibrillation seems to be a highly effective and safe method, but little experience exists concerning the outcome so far.	1.138036441970305
Especially the potential risk of inducing ventricular proarrhythmia is subject of current controversy.	0.8034131006300116
Modern imaging techniques are a substantial part of treatment planning for minimally invasive radiotherapeutic procedures.	0.985552232632855
The aim is three-dimensional assessment of the target volume and adjacent critical structures.	1.0295787720287126
In this paper, we report on our clinical experience with a precise system for stereotactic image correlation.	1.213037845621371
Hereby, the advantages of each imaging modality can be combined.	0.9978720164126366
Precise immobilization of the patient is a prerequisite.	1.4915737620876597
The immobilization method has an accuracy of less than 1 mm.	0.824769245192215
This method was evaluated in a clinical study in which a tumor control rate of 93 % was achieved in patients with brain metastases after stereotactic single high dose radiotherapy.	1.3221645226475447
This indicated the excellent reliability of this treatment planning method.	0.9505801260983752
The integration of functional image information, such as blood flow or activation of cerebral cortical areas, will be evaluated in the future.	0.9228053753592792
Olfactory dysfunction seems to be one of the most frequent symptoms in idiopathic parkinsonian syndrome (IPS).	0.9339227232966044
In contrast to the increasing number of studies providing evidence of the usefulness of olfactory tests in the diagnosis of IPS, clinical assessment of olfactory function is rarely performed.	1.2011637472638963
This may be due to the lack of an easy-to-use,  inexpensive, standardized, and reliable test.	1.1328676014875783
In this study, we administered the newly developed "sniffin' sticks" test to a group of 40 nondemented IPS patients and compared the results with 40 healthy controls matched for age, gender, and smoking habits.	1.096091122167519
In all three subtests including odor identification, odor detection threshold, and odor discrimination, the control group scored significantly better than the IPS group, yielding a specificity and sensitivity of 90% each.	1.1019576813062886
Our results indicate that olfactory disturbances in IPS can be found at early stages of the disease, appear bilaterally, and do not correlate with the dominant side of parkinsonism.	0.9850840409496321
Therefore, we emphasize that olfactory testing may be a useful tool in the diagnosis of IPS.	1.333765855054971
Purpose: The goal of this exemplary study was to integrate morphological and functional MRI to establish computer-based, preoperative therapy planning for tumors, instancing cervical carcinoma.	1.1687402807274616
Drug-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare but frequently lethal disease of the skin and mucosa of unknown etiology.	1.1735119086456527
Toxic metabolic and immunologic products in the serum have been discussed as possible causes.	0.922705618809799
For this reason we have performed plasmapheresis on these patients for many years.	1.0969853201681274
Results regarding survival and healing of the lesions are quite favorable, as exemplified with two patients described here who benefited from the procedure despite their old age.	1.1243229082839301
In order to gain insight into possible disease mechanisms that would explain the beneficial effect of plasmapheresis, we did immunohistochemical studies on these patients before and in one case after the procedure.	1.1878456586659014
In dermis and epidermis, there was a striking increase of macrophages and a relative increase of CD8-positive lymphocytes which might act as cytotoxic effector cells; these findings can be interpreted as the result of an immunological reaction.	1.0794052691419922
An increased staining of lesional epidermis with TNF, as previously noted by other autors, should be interpreted with caution since necrotic cells are involved.	0.9773743861909644
On the basis of the clinical results, the pathogenetic considerations, and in view of the lack of specific treatment modalities, clinical studies concerning plasmapheresis for the treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis are recommended, particularly since this procedure is widely available and generally well tolerated.	1.302320497317831
The majority of inflammatory frontal sinus diseases requiring operative intervention can now be managed successfully by endonasal surgery.	1.000989367126246
In problematic cases, however, optimal exposure of the entire frontal sinus and possibly complete mucous membrane removal combined with sinus obliteration must be achieved.	1.0866729913600521
In these cases, external frontal sinus surgery is indicated.	0.9909710030064027
Impaction of an intramedullary nail during extraction is an unpredictable and delicate situation.	0.8132797895890199
Its problematic nature is unfolded on a report of two cases, one with a Küntscher nail and one with a modern solid titanium nail.	0.9979286876724229
This event is caused by ingrowth of new bone formation into the slot or the dorsal flute respectively.	0.8587011352807439
The new bone formation is a mechanical barrier which effectively forces the distal part of the nail to jam against the cortex.	0.9038191343842581
Both, the slot of the unlocked reamed clover leaf nail and the wider dorsal flute of the solid titanium nail, realize certain therapeutic concepts.	0.8648623532132178
Their factual benefit within the concept of interlocking nailing is doubtful.	0.6632650278600495
Primary intracranial germ cell tumors are rare neurological diseases.	0.8230948884929384
Secreting germ cell tumors that predominantly appear in the pineal region are characterized by elevated levels of -HCG and AFP in CSF.	0.8453059094210609
Adequate diagnostic and therapeutic regimens of these tumors are still under debate.	0.9956705894276523
We present the case of a patient suffering from spinal metastasis of a secreting germ cell tumor with raised levels of -HCG in CSF.	1.0046791149329637
Six years before, a pineocytoma of intermediate differentiation had been diagnosed by stereotaxic biopsy.	1.0017251422466502
This demonstrates the importance of an early detection of a germ cell neoplasm in case of midline-sized brain-tumors by evaluation of -HCG and AFP in CSF and serum.	1.0633839905314513
Today, different therapeutic strategies depending on the histological diagnosis are available and justify a high priority of a surgical tumor biopsy.	1.1955784386815556
However, the value of stereotaxic procedures remains controversial.	0.8760393300362593
Recently published data gave evidence of a definite improved prognosis of secreting CNS germ cell tumors following combined treatment with high-dose polychemotherapy, surgical resection and radiation of the tumor area.	1.2236462868574363
-HCG and AFP may serve as useful markers to enable follow-up of the disease.	0.9890266531368176
In order to get a better data management of complications in orthopedic surgery and in order to get comparable statistics a standardisation of nomenclature and classification of complications is demanded since 1.1.1997.	1.088230009666542
The Orthopedic University Clinic of Heidelberg started with a register of all early complications of all inpatients.	0.8424073466987934
According to a standardized nomenclature all occured complications the doctors put in the data of complications in a database.	1.0766742196709087
These data were controlled, complemented and classified by members of the quality menagement group.	1.0497946754259737
This guideline consists of five parts: catalogue of diagnoses, general and special definitions, classification and an allocation table of diagnoses to grades of severity.	0.9360353183813578
The internet plays an important role in a growing number of medical applications.	0.9328680150754992
Finding relevant information is not always easy as the amount of available information on the Web is rising quickly.	1.0462052972216753
Even the best Search Engines can only collect links to a fraction of all existing Web pages.	0.8041102985464819
In addition, many of these indexed documents have been changed or deleted.	1.1620003247922026
The vast majority of information on the Web is not searchable with conventional methods.	0.8466208915113298
New search strategies, technologies and standards are combined in Intelligent Search Agents (ISA) and Robots, which can retrieve desired information in a specific approach.	1.0772583629935701
With the availability of modern imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), diagnostic options in the evaluation of Marfan patients have been improved profoundly.	1.0711394956286338
The most recent diagnostic advances comprise noninvasive tissue characterization of the aortic wall, immunofluorescence studies or pulse chase analyses of skin and cultured dermal fibroblasts, and molecular analysis at the cDNA/DNA level of the fibrillin-1 gene.	1.0647821623360003
New diagnostic insights have eventually led to revised nosologic criteria for the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome.	0.7963185757492456
The diagnostic reliability as well as the advantage and limitation of these recent diagnostic strategies are discussed: moreover diagnostic concepts for patients with neonatal as well as classic Marfan syndrome are presented and discussed in the context of the clinical management during adolescence, gravidity as well as in the pre- and postoperative patient.	1.2037932332042967
Primary defects of skeletal growth and development can be subdivided into hypoplasias, dysostoses and dysplasias.	0.8044663793312057
Hypoplastic bones are small but otherwise normal.	0.6466823877416399
Generalized skeletal hypoplasias comprise various forms of primordial dwarfism and syndromal disorders including trisomy 21 and Ullrich-Turner syndrome.	0.6985580094678854
Dysostoses are defects of bones as organs resulting from errors of morphogenesis.	0.7387811238442991
Many of them are caused by mutations of single genes in the cascade of morphogenetic gene sequences.	0.9254772393379523
Dysplasias are defects of bone as tissue.	0.6646144000567036
Some of them (e. g. achondroplasia, Jansen type of metaphyseal chondrodysplasia) are caused by defects of signal genes influencing cell division or differentiation.	0.9170696604914419
Others result from gene mutations affecting the cellular production of matrix components.	0.7225473732105425
Examples are collagenopathies such as osteogenesis imperfecta and some spondyloepiphyseal dysplasias.	0.6634861507521165
Finally, disorders such as pycnodysostosis, result from defects of chondro-osseous homeostasis.	1.0188759809557302
The study of skeletal defects helps to unravel the complexity of normal skeletal development.	0.8674247705445427
Human parvovirus B19 causes erythema infectiosum (fifth disease) and aplastic crisis.	0.8824396350300129
In pregnancy, B19 may be transmitted on to the fetus resulting in hydrops fetalis.	0.784118740531977
B19 is sometimes associated with thrombocytopenia and vasculitis.	0.6825043339679727
In immunocompromised patients, B19 may persist causing chronic infection.	0.6463751885594468
Several methods for detecting B19 virus or specific antibodies are now available.	0.7860048748310717
B19 infection does not usually require therapy.	0.5423590794095855
Efficacy of immunoglobulins in chronic B19 infection has been demonstrated.	0.8556349221340405
In absence of significant symptoms and signs, the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) remains difficult.	1.108936711960473
Sensitivity and specifity of laboratory tests, chest X-ray, and ECG on their own is low.	1.073783625591915
Echocardiography is particularly useful in critically ill patients suspected of having pulmonary emboli and can help identify right ventricular pressure overload.	0.9561987013150037
Venous ultrasonography is useful in patients with suspected PE, but normal results do not rule out PE.	1.0400455951378587
Helical CT with contrast medium can identify pulmonary emboli.	0.6282732972474196
However, if the CT findings are normal in the presence of a high index of clinical suspicion, only larger pulmonary embolism are ruled out, and angiography with the focus on distal pulmonary vasculature should be performed.	1.2907570524367087
The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism should be made by combining clinical assessment, several diagnostic techniques, and finally pulmonary angiography in doubtful cases.	1.1606911794978951
Heparin remains the standard therapy for patients with stable hemodynamics.	1.0468388824375063
Thrombolytic therapy is recommended in hemodynamically compromised patients.	0.960557260784471
In short-term dose regimes, the thrombolytic agents urokinase, streptokinase, and rt-PA seem to be equally efficient.	1.0812684105657215
So far, however, no study has proven that thrombolytic therapy significantly reduces mortality in pulmonary embolism.	1.0642868856077268
Background: Data on mesopic vision after LASIK are not available to date.	1.1645403195821535
We therefore evaluated mesopic vision in myopic eyes before and after LASIK.	0.7463297473228457
Renal tubular dysgenesis is a rarely recognized condition characterized by oligohydramnios, Potter's sequence and congenital anuria leading to stillbirth or neonatal death from respiratory failure.	0.8326639252889549
It is thought to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.	0.8842131811044266
Definitive diagnosis is based on renal histology, revealing the lack of proximal tubule differentiation.	0.865775286057178
Two additional cases of affected sibs in a family with parental consanguinity are reported.	0.8779870290644198
Lectin and immunohistochemical studies confirmed structural and functional immaturity of the proximal tubule.	1.038176165827848
Further findings include bilateral renal vein thrombosis.	0.5848622260486396
The clinical and morphological parameters defining this disorder and the possible mechanisms of pathogenesis are discussed.	1.1285728572825722
Articular cartilage has only a small capacity for regneration.	0.8638897445663393
This makes the repair of articular surfaces difficult.	0.821786807284564
In 1959 Pridie described his method of resurfacing osteoarthritic knee joints.	0.6459681818944639
This operation is still in widespread use today.	0.9138508412531454
Pridie introduced the principle of drilling exposed subchondral bone with the objective of encouraging a fibro-cartilaginous repair.	0.8893005293245402
The newly formed fibrocartilaginous layer that develops over the lesion in osteoarthritis may be enough to decrease patients symptoms.	0.8892619310294194
Bone drilling into the subchondral layer is also effective in promoting healing of osteochondrosis dissecans.	0.8607454025531146
The choice of the treatment should be based on factors such as age of the patient, serverity of symptoms, activity level and functional demands on the joint, site and stage of the lesion.	1.0649331081359816
The drilling operation remains useful in osteoathritis and osteochondrosis dissecans.	0.6542667472309114
Recent immunobiological findings together with advances in biotechnology, ameliorations in clinical trial design, and MRI developments have led to a variety of therapeutical approaches in multiple sclerosis (MS).	0.8359705339196492
However, in contrast to successfully introduced new treatments, a number of therapeutical failures exist as well: despite impressive data from animal models, convincing concepts, and promising phase I/II studies, some investigated drugs and strategies showed no positive effects in clinical trials, or trials had to be terminated because of unexpected side effects.	1.1627923255563943
This article provides an overview of clinical studies that have failed or been abandoned for other reasons.	0.9368931806873976
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -antagonists which have led to negative effects in two studies (Lenercept, Infliximab) are discussed in detail.	1.2281033847313205
These results raise critical questions concerning the hypothetical pathogenesis of MS lesions and the value of MRI in the assessment of clinically relevant therapeutic drug effects.	0.8972357744501929
In addition to a description of the immunobiological background, studies on the immunosuppressive agents linomide, deoxyspergualin, sulfasalazine and cladribine, trials for the cytokines interleukin-10 and TGF-2, the studies on remyelination by intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg), oral tolerance, and extracorporeal photopheresis are discussed.	1.1025861375286246
Isolated pancreatic metastases from renal-cell carcinomas (RCC) are extremely rare.	0.8262751402656352
Only 96 cases of clinically diagnosed renal-cell carcinoma metastatic to the pancreas have been reported in the world literature, and 70 of the patients (including ours) underwent a definitive surgical resection.	1.268119983396673
In many cases the time between the nephrectomy and diagnosis of metachronous metastases is reported to exceed 10 years.	1.047516635467088
Therefore, the initial diagnosis may be overlooked when there is a prolonged disease-free interval.	1.290023370649597
When it does occur simultaneously or metachronously, aggressive surgical resection, when possible, seems to be the most effective treatment for this metastatic lesion.	1.1142140437079926
Surgical resection can provide long-term survival in selected cases.	0.9708629824216791
We present the case of a 69-year-old woman in whom two pancreatic metastases were treated by a left-sided subtotal pancreatectomy with splenectomy, 12 years after radical nephrectomy for a RCC.	1.0780874549706208
The patient simultaneously presented with both a mass in the body of the pancreas and a right-sided colon cancer.	1.0140412146313003
Thus, the diagnosis of pancreatic metastasis of colon cancer was suspected initially.	1.1900454365854758
Both tumors were radically resected, and histological examination revealed two pancreatic metastases from the previous RCC.	1.087332178169048
In the world literature this report represents the eighth case of multiple pancreatic metastases due to RCC.	0.9523305710557687
It illustrates a rare indication of pancreatic resection because of pancreatic metastasis.	0.8938070404716171
The need for prolonged follow-up of patients is emphasized.	1.266749165515704
The few reports on surgically treated pancreatic metastases from RCC are reviewed after the presentation of this case.	0.9619070713341372
Delusion is understood to mean intersubjectively disconcerting convictions with a tendency toward subjective certainty that lose their disconcerting character when made the object of psychiatric analysis in the knowledge of their independence from mental disorder.	0.9382717830219379
The perceptions from which delusions arise are dynamically charged according to their role in the structural context.	0.8779115613273557
The realisation pressure that burdens the perceptions and is intensified in psychotic constitutions is a precondition for the delusion.	0.7522417174424774
The failure of derealisation brought about by the psychotic disorganisation of the structure is also a requirement.	0.990157729354689
Based on a case study, considerations arising out of the initial stages of schizophrenic delusion are extended to other forms of delusion and to the conditions for chronification.	1.1575983331080764
High-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) is a promising treatment for patients with germ cell tumours and a poor prognosis.	1.1441108962984439
The selection of patients who may profit from this intervention is challenging for the urologist, as the indication has to be carefully established.	1.1955563440028751
Exclusion criteria primarily concern impaired organ functions.	0.581896914751372
Prior to HDCT haematopoietic stem cells are obtained after the administration of conventional-dose chemotherapy plus G- or GM-CSF stimulation.	0.9787726905939388
HDCT consists of a combination of carboplatin, etoposide and ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide.	0.7275506389053822
After HDCT, haematologic monitoring and maximal supportive care are essential.	0.7314929940877474
It is therefore recommended that HDCT only be administered at specialized centres.	0.8845161776576926
Pyoderma gangrenosum develops in most patients between the age of 25 and 54 years.	1.050304384028278
It usually occurs in otherwise healthy persons or in association with a systemic desease.	0.8382034692095436
Several clinical variants of pyoderma gangrenosum have been described.	0.6431728632495647
Extremely painful ulcerations are characteristic and evolve rapidly.	0.6780845418853273
Malignant pyoderma, the variant described in our case report, is an aggressive variant of ulcerative pyoderma gangrenosum, rapidly progressive and a potentially lethal ulcerative disease.	1.2184231708597097
The diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum depends on recognition of the evolving clinical features because histopathologic changes are not specific and characteristically serological or hematological markers of the disease do not exist.	1.0796310623698033
Histopathologic findings, however, always include vasculitis, either in form of the necrotizing cutaneous vasculitis (7), granulomatous (1) or lymphocytic vasculitis (2).	1.211753855958842
We report on a 36-year-old male patient, who underwent surgery for repair of an aneurysm of the aortic arch.	1.2337978722428422
The aneurysm occurred two months after exacerbation of a malignant variant of pyoderma gangrenosum with nearly lethal exit.	0.9642258130883761
An association of pyoderma gangrenosum with vasculitis has been described previously, but the present report is the first to describe an aortic arch aneurysm which seems to be associated with necrotizing angiitis of the vasa vasorum caused by a pyoderma gangrenosum.	1.17127576363261
We could demonstrate successful perioperative treatment for prevention of exacerbation of pyoderma gangrenosum with prednisone and clofazimine	0.8721424820876307
Background and purpose: To test the association of cardiac sources of embolism with territorial type brain infarcts.	0.8878373733035894
Defects of the dorsal and ventral ligament complexes of the lumbar spine results to an instability of the functional spinal unit.	0.9620262685092029
For the prognosis of secondary instability due to disko-ligamentous injuries the functional insufficiency of the lasting scars is a larger problem than the primar loss of osseous stability with fast healing tendency.	0.9120704917264413
The main goal of the present biomechanical study in vitro was to demonstrate the different grades of instability in the correlation to progressive disko-ligamentous defects as well as stabilisation through dynamic and static procedures.	1.0332548131438366
With a transpedicular screw-ringband-system the segmental function was preserved and instability was abolished.	0.8101113237078086
After rigid instrumentation with a fixateur intern remained a residual range of motion due to which can result refuse to bending moments without spondylodesis in an implant failure.	0.9367566247781198
CT- or MRI-guided stereotactic procedures should be a standard in a modern neurosurgical unit.	1.1089532318022284
Analysing 71 cases the indications and results of stereotactic neurosurgery are presented.	0.8858294297236202
In 53 patients stereotactic serial biopsies of different intraaxial lesions were performed, in 5 patients a spontaneous haemorrhage of the basal ganglia was removed by lysis with r-tPA.	1.0214998794866916
In 3 patients suffering from hydrocephalus due to diencephalic cysts a cystventricular shunt device was implanted.	0.7716460600543376
In 3 patients an intracerebral abscess was aspirated and drained.	0.8241553756554093
A stereotactic guided craniotomy and excision of small deep-seated lesions was performed in 6 cases.	0.9543002138012275
The accuracy of stereotactic tumour biopsies was 88.7 % in our series, in accordance to other authors.	1.2822177101177756
The stereotactic aspiration and drainage of an intracerebral abscess provides accurate localization and minimal cortical damage and offers the possibility of intracavitary application of antibiotics.	0.914991967806139
The stereotactic internal shunt implantation seems to be an alternative approach in the treatment of diencephalic cysts due to its minimal invasiveness and low operative risk.	1.073673702984611
The aspiration of basal ganglia haematomas with insertion of an external drainage allows the lysis of the haematoma with r-tPA or urokinase.	0.8560497576162578
With stereotactic guidance small, deep-seated intraaxial lesions can be well localized and removed.	0.7291876968848867
Radiotherapy of patients with prostate cancer offers an alternative to radical prostatectomy in early stages (T1-T2).	1.1214792403979712
In locally advanced prostate cancer a high dose or combined radiotherapy is more effective than radical surgery with concurrent lower morbidity and mortality.	0.9109162486798571
Recent developments in linear accellerator technique, the progress in dose calculation and planning techniques provide the means to apply higher doses to a given tumor volume while effectively protecting the surrounding normal tissue at the same time.	0.9986077212768419
These improvements may possibly reduce the rate of therapy related side effects or complications significantly.	0.8444878157542276
The combination of external beam radiotherapy and interstitial brachytherapy as well as the combination of hormone therapy and external beam radiotherapy are most likely more effective than percutaneous irradiation alone.	1.1115550030661472
In special cases with a very low risk of recurrent tumor an interstitial permanent brachytherapy alone is indicated.	1.1450269124809505
Future developments (i. e. intensity modulated radiotherapy - IMRT, combined thermo-radiotherapy, proton- or neutrontherapy) may further increase the rate of curative treatments in patients with prostate cancer.	1.1415979054967031
Skin is the second most common site of extranodal lymphoma.	0.8228117939913555
The significance of cutaneous B-cell lymphomas has been underestimated due to the lack of monoclonal antibodies and molecular genetics in former years.	0.926668058863299
Cutaneous B-cell lymphomas represent a heterogenous group of entities which show variation in histology, immunophenotype and in prognosis.	0.8104544977778017
The most common entities presenting in skin are follicular lymphomas, marginal zone B-cell lymphomas, and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.	1.0451959874801608
The majority of primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas have an excellent prognosis.	1.1314343425652063
Whereas in B-cell lymphomas with secondary spread to the skin the clinical course is dependant on the prognosis of the primary lymphoma.	1.2907135265127798
It is evident that primary cutaneous lymphomas are distinct from nodal lymphomas and not extranodal manifestations of their lymph-node-based counterparts.	0.9465085425430882
In the current review the morphologic spectrum of cutaneous B-cell lymphomas comprising primary and secondary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas is discussed according to the WHO classification sheme.	1.0880908790198698
The phencyclidine derivative ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist with the thalamo-neocortical projection system as the primary site of action.	0.8354140621470991
Racemic ketamine consists of the enantiomers S(+)-ketamine and R(-)-ketamine.	1.0241192701732937
Racemic ketamine has never been considered an adequate anaesthetic agent in neurosurgical patients since  it produces regionally specific stimulation of cerebral metabolism (CMRO2) and increases cerebral blood flow (CBF) and intracranial pressure (ICP).	0.871089232917736
However, recent experiments suggest that both tracemic ketamine and S(+)-ketamine may reduce infarct size in animal models of incomplete cerebral ischaemia and brain injury.	1.1221580825111617
This experimental protective effect appears to be related to decreases in Ca++ influx and maintenance of brain tissue magnesium levels due to NMDA and quisqualate receptor blockade by ketamine.	0.7667781194946346
Studies in dogs have shown that racemic ketamine (2.0 mg/kg) increases CBF in the presence of the cerebral vasodilator N2O.	0.9415521868882762
In contrast, studies in rats without background anaesthesia showed increases in CBF after racemic ketamine (100 mg/kg i.p.).	1.050470761926026
This suggests that the cerebrovascular effects of racemic ketamine are related to the pre-existing cerebrovascular tone induced by background anaesthetics.	0.5475619690380824
Cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity was maintained regardless of the baseline cerebrovascular resistance.	0.7707658660036004
There are several mechanisms by which racemic ketamine may increase CBF.	0.9306976699173773
It induces dose-dependent respiratory depression with consequent mild hypercapnia in spontaneously ventilating subjects.	0.775014072176951
This produces vasodilation due to the intact cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity.	0.8522374349305263
Racemic ketamine also induces regional neuroexcitation, which leads to stimulation of cerebral glucose consumption in the limbic, extrapyramidal, auditory, and sensory-motor systems.	1.1075631653798605
This regional neuroexcitation with increased CMRO2 produces increases in CBF that can be blocked by infusion of barbiturates or benzodiazepines.	0.8202280339156787
However, increases in CBF with racemic ketamine (1 mg/kg) may also occur during normocapnia and without changes in CMRO2.	1.3951137928024677
This effect is related to some additional direct cerebral vasodilating potency of racemic ketamine based on a mechanism involving blockade of Ca++ channels.	0.950398787971273
The effects of racemic ketamine on CBF autoregulation have not been investigated systematically.	0.8013488990844803
However, studies in rats have shown that CBF autoregulation was maintained with low- and high-dose S(+)-ketamine.	1.2541870107395316
Infusion of racemic ketamine alters intracranial volume and ICP.	0.7319721038857878
Studies in spontaneously ventilating pigs with and without intracranial hypertension have shown that racemic ketamine (0.5-5.0 mg/kg) produces increases in PaCO2 and ICP.	1.0010106720855763
In contrast, identical experiments with mechanical ventilation and controlled PaCO2 showed no changes in ICP following racemic ketamine infusion.	0.9700704563075164
This implies that increases in ICP are related to inadequate ventilation with consecutive hypercapnia and increases in intracranial blood volume.	0.877599714935852
However, mechanical ventilation may not be sufficient to control ICP following racemic ketamine.	1.2803314961925638
Experiments in mechanically ventilated dogs indicate that racemic ketamine (2 mg/kg) increases cerebral blood volume and ICP even in the presence of normoventilation, a response that is reversible by hyperventilation or the administration of diazepam.	1.0668971407707422
Studies in patients have shown that racemic ketamine (2.0 mg/kg) reduces CBF in the presence of cerebral vasodilators like halothane or N2O.	0.9055460706335634
In contrast, studies in unanaesthetised humans showed increases in CBF after racemic ketamine (2-3 mg/kg).	0.9634221036576291
This observation is consistent with animal studies and suggests that the cerebrovascular effects of racemic ketamine are related to the pre-existing cerebrovascular tone induced by background anaesthetics.	0.6230316126368938
Dengue-Fever is a mosquito transmitted viral disease.	0.6503559282907619
It is endemic mainly in South-East Asia and Afrika.	0.7186418233973374
The clinical manifestation is divided into different stages.	0.6583124989253416
Ocular manifestations in travellers have been rarely reported.	0.6879231414952879
Sufficient and regular wetting of the cornea with a normal preocular tear film is an essential requirement for the accurate visual functioning of the eye.	1.0158878493231838
Multiple factors may cause tear film instability.	0.7323690381174051
Measuring the break-up time of the preocular tear film is a necessary, clinically reliable means for evaluating tear film stability.	1.0313615979543405
We designed a new instrument to observe the preocular tear film at high magnification which can contribute to the in vivo imaging of the physiological and pathophysiological dynamics of the tear film and its break-up phenomena.	0.9389100437540756
The prevalence of hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV infections among drug abuse-related fatalities in Hamburg (1985-1997) was investigated with respect to epidemiological, forensic and morphological aspects.	1.0350789733892078
The purpose of this study was (1) to determine the prevalence of hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV infections among drug abuse-related fatalities (drug deaths) in Hamburg from 1985 to 1997, (2) to assess the rate of multiple infections and (3) to analyze the liver histomorphology in 100 autopsied drug deaths.	1.1612959538499903
Furthermore, we discuss the epidemiological and forensic aspects.	1.3489434014640382
In this period 1469 drug deaths were registered with a prevalence for HBV of 35% (1997: 39%), for HCV 51% (1997: 58%), and for HIV 7% (1997: 15%).	1.2359866083013662
Co-infections were common (28%) and 19% of all cases were infected with HBV and HCV.	1.1300998193140785
The liver histology showed that hepatitis was frequently diagnosed (74%) and was associated with HBV and/or HCV infections (77% of all hepatitis cases).	1.152738266260205
Only 9% showed a normal liverhistology.	1.332844127321725
Forensic autopsies and monitoring of HBV, HCV and HIV infections in drug deaths represent an important tool to gain information about the individual case and the situation among i.v.	1.0048105777125216
Background: An abnormal coronary flow reserve represents an early marker of impaired blood flow regulation in the natural history of coronary atherosclerosis under the impact of risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia.	1.2089254856100593
Our clinical investigation was aimed at assessing noninvasively the integrative coronary flow response to dipyridamole stress in 18 consecutive patients with microvascular angina, only moderately elevated LDL-cholesterol levels (168 +/- 33 mg/dl), and reduced vasodilator capacity despite normal (n=9) or slightly abnormal (n=9) coronary arteriograms (minimal disease with luminal irregularities and/or diameter reduction <=30%) before and after 6-month lipid-lowering therapy (simvastatin).	1.0552688461072277
Methods: Regional and averaged myocardial blood flow were measured at rest and after dipyridamole induced vasodilation (0.56 mg/kg) using dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and N-13 ammonia as flow tracer related to a 3-compartment kinetic model.	1.1470221187205187
Baseline data (mean +/- SD): 13 males, 5 females; mean age: 56 +/- 8 years; basal coronary flow: 90 +/- 22 ml/minx100 g; after lipid intervention: 93 +/- 18 ml/minx100 g (n.s.).	1.0912379585331449
Total cholesterol decreased to 170 +/- 36 mg/dl (p<0.001); mean LDL level: 97 +/- 26 mg/dl (p<0.001).	0.9570657401356154
Coronary dilator capacity increased, assessed in terms of minimal coronary resistance: 0.38 +/- 0.08 vs 0.49 +/- 0.09 units at baseline (p<0.01), myocardial blood flow under dipyridamole: 232 +/- 43 vs 186 +/- 37 ml/minx100 g at baseline (p<0.01), and instantaneous flow ratio: 2.6 +/- 0.7 vs 2.2 +/- 0.6 (p=0.06).	1.062893942913062
Concomitantly, a considerable regression of angina was noticed in the majority of patients.	1.0719952842954656
Conclusions: An improvement of the non-invasively determined integrative dipyridamole induced coronary vasodilator capacity may be achieved after 6 months by intensive lipid lowering at a very early stage of coronary atherosclerosis.	1.0914499617911342
Consequently, aggressive cholesterol-lowering therapy represents an antiischemic and antianginal approach suggesting, at least in part, functional reversal and probably prevention of further disease progression.	1.0143998584778606
We report the case of a a 60 year-old worker in the pharmaceutical industry who suffered from recurring contact dermatitis.	1.0484345300841467
Initially the contact dermatitis was limited to the hands; later on it became generalized.	0.9224649416851368
The patient had been working on a drug filling line in a pharmaceutical plant for more than 20 years.	1.0068525384697042
Eight years after starting this job he had developed allergic hand dermatitis to 2,6-diaminopyridine (patch test positive); this healed upon cessation of exposure.	0.8688692738239183
Ten years later he again developed hand dermatitis which progressed to generalized dermatitis and conjunctivitis.	0.7950894788402625
Under systemic and local therapy with corticosteroids and cessation of work, it healed nearly completly.	0.9991985494702943
Four months after returning to work, the patient experienced a first episode of severe asthma and generalized dermatitis with conjunctivitis following exposure to hydroxychloroquine the day before.	1.0742630463680571
The asthma and dermatitis improved after systemic corticosteroid therapy and stopping work.	0.7352682195320319
His condition continued to fluctuate, when though the patient was transferred at work and now wore rubber gloves.	1.0691711801527153
Eight months later he again developed a generalized dermatitis.	0.8443197042259627
Patch testing revealed delayed-type sensitizations to hydroxychloroquine (tested in concentrations of 0.1%, 0.5%, 1% and 2%).	1.3229562039530376
Equivalent tests in five healthy volunteers were negative.	0.7352666041747796
The patch test reactions were pustular, while a biopsy was interpreted as a multiform contact dermatitis reaction.	0.9892668474710332
Bronchial exposure with hydroxychloroquine dust produced a delayed bronchial obstruction over the next 20 hours, which progressed to fever and generalized erythema (hematogenous contact dermatitis).	0.9746572578327314
After removing exposure to 2,6-diaminopyridine and hydroxychloroquine, the patient went on to develop a contact dermatitis to latex (patch test positive).	1.012359385825831
However, skin prick tests with latex and patch tests with rubber additiva were negative.	1.1597197766067469
Hydroxychloroquine is well known to cause drug reactions.	1.0468271770526247
To our knowledge, contact dermatitis to this substance has not yet been reported.	0.8165370437971478
It is noteworthy that the patch test reactions were pustular and of multiform morphology and that bronchial exposure to the allergen resulted in asthma and a generalized drug reaction.	0.8961883323066119
Pathogenetically the asthmatic reaction seems to be on a delayed-type mechanism as is also seen with ampicillin, cobalt and nickel induced asthma.	0.8765682708371095
A 45 years old female runner developed a bilateral tendinopathy of the Achilles tendon after repeated antimicrobiotical treatment with ciprofloxacin.	0.9416628784120314
One month later the right Achilles tendon ruptured without any sudden pain.	0.7931314449790933
MRI revealed degenerative changes of the left Achilles tendon; on the right side the tendon was ruptured with a dehiscence of 4 cm between both ends of the tendon.	1.1322990794034367
The tendon was reconstructed surgically.	0.7041769779664894
The histological analysis showed cystic changes with focal necrosis.	0.7243180852317705
This finding differ from findings in non drug induced tendinopathies.	0.7682057287756586
After antimicrobiotical treatment with ciprofloxacin the side effect of a tendon disorder must be considered.	0.8851496109374452
The impairment of the tendon may be as strong that a tendon rupture may occur at daily living activities without any typical clinical symptoms.	1.0551850128975067
The recent results obtained from investigations based on molecular biological techniques have led to a better understanding of recurrent genetic causes important for the pathogenesis of tumors.	1.0096931587292688
Several genes have been identified as being involved in the development of cancer.	0.8924489710840598
In many cases, the activation of oncogenes or the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes is the predominant reason for cancerogenic cell transformation.	1.0294236756350241
Functional dysregulation is frequently the consequence of mutations, resulting in an alteration of the primary structure of the DNA.	1.1342954726176775
As our understanding of the nature, function, and interaction of these genes evolves, new opportunities for early diagnosis, classification, prevention, and treatment of malignant tumors will arise.	1.1856079149480485
The present report summarizes the current molecular biological aspects of several oncogenes (erbB, ras, myc, raf, fos, jun, bcl, mdm 2, myb, kit CSF1R, met) and tumor suppressor genes (p 53, rb, mts) involved in lung-cancer development with respect to the pathology of lung tumors, including the importance of these genes as far as the clinical course of the disease is concerned.	1.1856088904321556
Hyperbaric Oxygen (HBO) therapy is a kind of medical treatment in which a patient breathes 100% of oxygen inside a pressure chamber while the pressure of the chamber is increased to a point higher than sea level pressure.	1.1706303901527053
It is strongly based on clearly defined physical laws and physiological regularities.	0.7758269907668929
For the clinical use of HBO therapy, according to international recommendations, there are several commonly accepted indications in which HBO either is the only causative life-saving kind of treatment, or is an essential and oftenly decisive component of a comprehensive interdisciplinary intensive care therapy.	1.1181863593816281
Among potential adverse effects, barotrauma of the lungs and especially oxygen toxicity to the central nervous system have to be mentioned.	0.9682817639144421
Clinical use of HBO therefore requires special knowledge of its effects, risks, and adverse effects, a clear and distinct indication, and the ability and skills to keep complications under control by means of intensive care or emergency medical measures.	1.1568577922483807
The clinical use of hyperbaric oxygen with its interdisciplinary-like character of emergency medicine or intensive care therapy therefore should be an additional, most interesting field of activity for the anaesthesiologist.	1.0872973031422777
Although arthroscopy of the ankle joint has been well established, there are only very few reports about arthroscopy in ankle fracture treatment.	1.1494634732054432
In order to sytematically analyze the intraarticular lesions of ankle fractures, we assessed 196 consecutive ankle fractures immediately before ORIF.	0.9862152869570286
There were 94 male and 101 female patients with an average age of 47.8 years (16-88 years).	0.9815355306723833
There were more cartilage lesions found than expected, and cartilage lesions were not noted more frequently in type C-fractures than in type B-fractures.	1.1618752649053157
In both fracture types, an increasing amount of cartilage lesions was found from group 1 to 3.	1.0579470586691326
In addition, more ligament injuries were found than expected, especially in the B.1- and B.2-fractures.	1.4430301764859548
Successful arthroscopic surgery was performed in 26 cases: internal fixation, 9; loose body removal, 7; ligament reposition, 5; cartilage smoothening, 4; and cartilage fracture repair, 1.	1.0770370842065486
In one case, a periostal flap could not be reduced, and in another case, the internal fixation of the medial malleolus was not stable.	1.2155200013103746
In summary, arthroscopy was shown to be a very helpful diagnostic tool in ankle fractures.	1.1632319147395787
As long-term results are not yet available, it remains, however, unclear as to whether arthroscopy may improve the success of the following ORIF.	1.487182221077868
Arthroscopy was also shown to be a successful tool for several closed surgical procedures.	1.0140875644207201
Of these, percutaneous internal fixation of the medial malleolus under arthroscopic view may be an excellent indication.	1.182936519205983
Objective: Transcultural adaption of the two most widely used and accepted functional indices in ankylosing spondylitis, the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) and Dougados Functional Index (D-FI).	1.1005866836990505
Methods: The instruments were translated and tested for internal consistency (Cronbach's coefficient alpha), test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC), construct validity (testing for association with Schober's test, finger floor distance, occiput wall distance, frequency and duration of awakenings at night, and a visual analog scale pain), and responsiveness (standardized response mean, SRM).	1.0704388839719723
Results: The study sample consisted of 72 patients of a randomized, controlled clinical trial receiving either Diclofenac or placebo.	1.0735749845275915
Visual assessment of distribution patterns revealed a ceiling effect of both instruments.	0.811888349731904
Both questionnaires had a high internal consistency (Cronbach alpha: 0.81 [BASFI], 0.85 [D-FI] and a high test-retest reliability (ICC: 0.92 [BASFI], 0.89 [D-FI]).	1.1583728469447574
The limited responsiveness to Diclofenac treatment (SRM: 0.46 [BASFI],  0.33 [D-FI]) may be related to the selected study sample.	1.1566643375923809
The BASFI was significantly correlated with all tested validation parameters.	0.7326336965558687
The  D-FI was only significantly correlated with finger floor distance, occiput wall distance, and duration of awakenings at night.	0.8285968220978217
Conclusion: The transculturally adapted version of both functional indices are valid, reliable, and internally consistent.	1.0998987543898293
Because of psychometric advantages, the BASFI may be preferred in clinical trial settings.	1.0401539159781026
The role of radiotherapy of the pelvic lymphatic pathways in patients with node positive prostate cancer remains uncertain.	1.030926241698285
Interpretation of the few prospective studies (RTOG 75-06 and 77-06) is hampered by severe flaws in the study design.	1.116729203976599
Extension of the radiation to the paraaortal region shows no advantage over radiation of the pelvic lymphatics alone and is not warranted.	0.9988403276125162
Data on longterm side-effects are only available from older studies with outdated radiation techniques.	0.907981709291524
According to more recent studies short term side effects are considerably higher with radiation of the pelvic lymphatics when compared with radiation of the prostate alone.	1.052310306311855
In summary radiation of the lymphatic pathways in lymph node positive prostate cancer cannot currently be considered as standard treatment and should be carried out within clinical studies.	1.0249672345932206
In reconstruction of cartilage defects, autogenous transplantation is known as a reliable and experienced method.	0.9639467037803277
Although a clinical application has not been reported until now, tissue engineering permits in vitro production of autogenous cartilage transplants.	1.0556440065019392
Nevertheless, in both methods the cartilage is exposed to individually varying resorptive mechanisms.	1.170048216947748
Among other methods for in vivo tissue protection, the encapsulation with a semipermeable polyelectrolytecomplex membrane could guarantee sufficient protection against resorptive influences.	0.934102853462347
Human septal cartilage was encapsulated (group 1) with polyelectrolytecomplex membranes and subcutaneously implanted on the back of thymusaplastic nude mice.	1.0383805860388018
Cartilage implants without encapsulation (group 2) were used as control.	1.1192201980916392
Scanning electron microscopy and histochemical investigations were performed 1, 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks after implantation.	1.0813382786148182
Group 1 showed no signs of resorption and chronic inflammation at all.	0.8811932177873414
In contrast, group 2 presented, correlating to the time of implanta-tion, increasing signs of cell death and fibrotic transformation, representing an increased activity of resorption.	1.1738682750470302
In conclusion, tissue encapsulation with a polyelectrolytecomplex membrane could ensure a sufficient protection of human cartilage transplants from resorptive influences.	1.0045312771629664
For the plastic-reconstructive surgeon the desired result becomes more calculable.	0.8401739143852828
Subjective time-experience and objective time-estimation were examined in 20 endogenous, 20 neurotic depressives, and 15 healthy volunteers.	1.2280359854980227
Subjective experience of past and anticipated future time was more extended in both depressive groups than in healthy controls.	0.832518740636908
Objective time estimation differed between depressives and controls concerning relatively long time spans whereas very short time spans were correctly estimated also by depressives.	0.8524030888488364
There were no significant differences between endogenous and neurotic depressives.	0.8117186164242156
The perception of extended time normalized during treatment.	0.697688082412349
The depressives' time perception, differences correlated with the extent of depressive psychopathological symptoms and - to a lesser degree - with retardation.	1.2060687196827957
The findings support the hypotheses of anthropological phenomenology concerning disturbed time perception and estimation in depressives.	0.7337126169554055
Amelioration of experienced time-extension in intentionally structured time spans compared to empty time spans suggests psychotherapeutic consequences in the sense of Lewinsohn.	0.8546043549258205
We investigated whether the free-to-total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ratio (f-PSA/t-PSA ratio; i. e. percentage of free PSA) represents a better discriminator for the detection of cancer of the prostate (CaP).	1.0329941872555235
In a retrospective analysis, the persentage of free PSA was determined in the sera of 35 patients with histologically proven benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 35 patients with clinically localized CaP.	1.1951217006974955
Patients with urolithiasis (n = 33) served as a control group.	0.9898333550511413
Serum levels of free PSA and total PSA were determined employing a chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay.	0.8264312096419889
Patients with CaP demonstrated a lower percentage of free PSA (median: 8.7) than patients with BPH (median: 20.0; P < 0.001) and those with urolithiasis (median: 18.8; P < 0.001).	1.0380457837222685
Determination of the percentage of free PSA enhances the differentiation between BPH and CaP and may reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies in patients with an elevated PSA.	1.0644521800955828
Confirmation of our preliminary results is required.	0.5877135371858001
Psychological problems in children and parents related to children's atopic eczema (AE) may impede the success of treatment.	1.0727053306624623
We studied the question, if behavior-based parental education in groups (DPE) or standardized video-education (VPE) could enhance dermatological treatment effects and reduce skin-damaging behaviors in children and stress in their mothers.	1.1160327938305499
Sevoflurane degrades in CO2 absorbents to produce compound A, which may have  hepatotoxic potential in humans.	1.0737034646030903
Several recent studies in human volunteers have been performed to evaluate this potential.	1.0792896749507537
Three studies have evaluated sevoflurane administered to volunteers using a 3% concentration for 8 h duration at approximately 2 L/min flow rate.	1.0453888216515257
The initial investigation found high excretion of protein, glucose and renal tubular enzymes in the urine of the volunteers receiving sevoflurane.	0.9468771907034349
Subsequent investigations using identical protocols found more minor or absent changes in excretion of these markers.	0.821322976405499
One additional investigation in volunteers studied 3% sevoflurane anesthesia for 4 h duration using a low-flow (1 L/min) technique.	1.2481682706898234
No significant excretion of protein, glucose or renal enzymes was observed.	0.7401498480842855
Application of these results to clinical practice must be interpreted in light of the experimental nature of the anesthetic administration.	1.1898418764831749
Although some controversy remains, these data, combined with results of recent studies in surgical patients, suggest that renal function following modest duration low-flow sevoflurane anesthesia is similar to that following isoflurane anesthesia.	1.1250486660400967
Background: The microbial colonization of the intestinal tract in newborns begins during delivery.	0.9627495017680368
Streptococci and Escherichia coli pave the way for the bifidobacterial dominance typical in breast-fed newborns.	0.8203589585880038
They provide optimal living conditions for anaerobic bifidobacteria by withdrawal of intraluminal oxygen.	0.7183839885108114
A mixed intestinal flora is established on infant formula feeding in the infant.	0.7539315236080644
Bifidobacteria, Bacteroides, Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci and lactobacilli are the main genera of this mixed intestinal flora.	0.8671335128438359
This represents an intermediate stage of the microflora in adults.	0.8561222466093471
The bifidogenic effect of mothers' milk is based on the active substances it contains, which selectively enhance the growth of bifidobacteria, whereas other active substances suppress the growth of the accompanying flora.	1.132601432317602
Bifidus-enhancing factors in breast-feeding are lactose, oligosaccharides, glycoproteins such as glycomacropeptide and the inoculation with bifidobacteria deriving from the skin surface of the mother.	0.9436813955209035
Factors directed to the suppression of the accompanying microflora are antibodies, lactoferrin, lysozyme, fatty acids and monoglycerides that act as antimicrobial substances and the comparatively low protein and iron content in mothers' milk.	0.8428673857896545
A bifidus-inhibiting colonization of the intestinal tract with pathogenic germs is caused by maternal birth-canal infections, which are now known to be the most frequent reason for premature births.	1.1395452006008628
An increasing number of surgical deliveries, the separation of the newborn infant from its mother, and the generous use of antibiotics contribute to the delayed colonization of bifidobacteria and to the development of life-threatening nosocomial infections.	1.2891880267262243
Counteractive measures against this disastrous situation are the preferential use of bifidobacteria-preserving antibiotics and the inoculation of lyophilized bifidobacteria.	0.900704755828368
Between January 1983 and December 1987, metatarsal head-resections were performed on 203 patients, comprising a total of 370 feet, using the Hueter/Mayo and Hoffmann procedure.	0.9605086247091642
Seventy-two patients, comprising a total of 126 feet, were available for post-operative review after an average of 11.4 years from the date of the original operations.	1.1796600870745089
The information obtained from standardized questionnaires was compared to the information found in each patient's file.	1.081803092509125
In addition, every available pre- and post-operative x-ray taken from 1983 to 1987 was analyzed.	1.0813157194115253
Thus, with an average follow-up period of 5.6 years, the changes found in the pre- and post-operative x-rays from a total of 183 feet could be compared.	1.3318002782613791
Before the operations, nearly 100% of the examined feet suffered from painful synovial hypertrophy and erosion of the metatarsophalangeal joints with dislocation and subluxation, causing approximately 70% of all patients to have great difficulties in walking.	1.0859322840971104
After the operations, however, 90.2% of the patients reported that this condition had noticeably improved or had completely disappeared.	1.23181964732436
In fact, 87.5% of all patients reported a lasting improvement in their ability to walk longer distances.	1.1040970893079343
As the main criteria in determining the success of an operation (namely, the noticeable reduction of pain and increased mobility) were achieved in 87.5% of the patients, we consider the metatarsal head-resection a reliable method of correcting forefoot deformities in rheumatoid arthritis.	1.1975099094303658
Bone metabolism is influenced by systemic and local acting hormons.	0.7597701515074996
Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) as representatives of the latter substances are known to have the ability for ectopic bone formation.	1.127510920350042
Within this study, we investigated the influence of different growth factors on the proliferation- and differentiation rate of osteoblast-like cells.	1.1473420462277606
For that purpose, human osteoblast-like cells (HPOC) were incubated in the presence of either recombinant BMP-4 of the genome of xenopus laevis (rxBMP-4), recombinant human BMP 2 (rhBMP-2), transforming growth factor-ß (TGF-ß) or basic fibroblast growth factor (rh-bFGF) in two different concentrations each (10 ng/ml and 50 ng/ml).	1.1609703853740512
Cell proliferation was measured within a MTT [3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromid] assay, the amount of cell differentiation by the activity of alcaline phosphatase.	1.3332224896540454
Rx-BMP-4 induced a differentiation of HPOC to almost the same extent as rhBMP-2, whereas the addition of rh-bFGF, applied at the same concentration, failed to have any influence on cell differentiation.	1.073376757443745
However, rh-bFGF provoked an increase in cell proliferation when compared with unstimulated HPOC, while rhBMP-2 and rxBMP-4 showed no effect on proliferation.	1.1675876137306493
TGF-ß influenced bone proliferation as well as differenciation significantly.	0.7873171681612109
The equipotent effect of recombinant human BMP-2 and recombinant BMP-4 obtained from Xenopus laevis with regard to differentiation and proliferation of human primary osteoblast-like cells originates either in the fact that target cells have receptors for BMP 2 as well as BMP 4, or that both BMP's link to the same receptor with almost the same affinity.	1.0382762713781906
Sonography has provided an important addition to the tools available for the diagnosis of the soft tissues in the head and neck region.	1.02876134774903
The ENT surgeon himself is able to examine pathological formations by this quick, non-invasive and, last but not least, less expensive method.	0.9395675598149904
Due to the high resolution of the procedure the chance of detecting even small changes is increased and the exactness of diagnosis of pathological lymph nodes of the neck has been significantly improved compared to palpation alone.	1.1746762440061218
Ultrasound has replaced the sialographic procedures in the field of diagnostic evaluation of salivary gland disease in the daily practice except for special indications.	0.982992890012493
After inauguration of color Doppler sonography non-invasive evaluation of vascular stenosis of the large cervical vessels concerning their hemodynamic effects has become possible.	0.9336565216741113
This issue is important for the differential dignosis of otoneurological diseases such as sudden hearing loss, vertigo and tinnitus.	0.8642286598292022
Additionally, the extent of perfusion of space-occupying lesions can be easily examined, and therefore the risk of mass bleeding can be preoperatively assessed by this method without harm to the patient.	1.1207978137616774
Especially carotid body tumors may be diagnosed with high accuracy by the evidence of significant diffuse perfusion of the lesion.	0.9371107760088063
In several studies the specificity of the assessment of cervical lymph node disease could be increased by examination of resistance indices.	1.0955842738980235
However, other authors have shown inconsistent results in differentiation of benign and malignant lumps; therefore, final judgment does not seem to be possible yet.	1.225275690428432
Use of echo-contrast agents to enhance the ultrasound signal seems to be a promising approach for future developments in color Doppler imaging.	1.001804840308837
Painful stiffness of the shoulder is an ill-defined clinical entity that is difficult to assess and delicate to treat.	1.0233171532961534
The nomenclature used is broad and includes terms such as frozen shoulder, adhesive capsulitis, focal algodystrophy, stiff shoulder, contracted shoulder, and others.	0.930393293334749
Apart from its idiopathic form, the disease can be initiated by trauma, infection, tumour, radiation, systemic and local metabolic disturbances.	1.1634638649060562
Pathoanatomically, the common denominator is an inflammatory vascular proliferation followed by thickening, scarring, and retraction of the joint capsule.	1.0408165135051135
The inflammatory process often starts at the rotator interval and may extend to the subacromial space.	0.8922369861754963
The prognosis for patients in whom metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is not treated is unfavorable, with a reported 5-year survival of 0-18 %.	1.2468184427680014
Before the era of immunotherapy and in the absence of effective nonsurgical therapy, resection of metastases was the accepted way to prolong survival, giving a 5-year survival of 7-69 %.	1.0998797456936296
Retrospective studies have shown that several clinical factors are associated with a relatively good prognosis.	0.9201843365106073
Some patients will benefit from resection of metastases, but most patients with metastatic RCC are not candidates for such aggressive surgery.	1.0524605740161983
The use of interleukin-2 has demonstrated that immunotherapy can produce durable remissions.	0.8931507878508076
Without randomized trials, it is difficult to know whether survival is longer than that in untreated patients, but there is clear evidence that immunotherapy improves survival and yields long-lasting remissions in selected patients.	1.1016074982218105
Many questions remain concerning quality of life and the benefit-to-risk ratio of immunotherapy, but it is the most effective treatment for metastatic RCC.	1.2659180062695838
After loss of active glenohumeral motion the arm cannot be positioned in space and function is impaired.	0.8668653573359741
Fusion of the glenohumeral joint creates a new platform for the movement of elbow, hand and fingers and leads to an improvement of function.	0.874910968924685
The use of the reconstructive plate makes the operation easier.	0.885704770915569
Shoulder fusion is especially suited if the function of elbow and hand is well preserved and if the patient is physically active.	1.0522677010775592
But fusion is definite and the options of muscle transfer operations and above elbow amputation have to be considered.	0.8567181904328487
The unreamed femoral nail (UFN) system, with its numerous proximal interlocking options, allows a minimal invasive surgical procedure for the treatment of nearly all femoral fracture patterns.	1.086757681607608
Sixty-six fractures, 5 cases of osteolysis or pathologic fractures, 2 limb shortenings and 1 lengthening (monorail technique) and 3 cases of pseudarthrosis were stabilised with the UFN from July 1994 to December 1996.	1.1605341803032339
The fractures were analysed according to the AO classification.	0.8093773953375878
We found 31 polytrauma patients with an mean ISS of 21.8 and a mean PTS of 25.4.	1.1591929868854711
Most of the multiply injured patients (n = 26) were stabilised with the UFN primarily.	1.1725606681828313
Follow-up of 44 patients ranged from 4 to 18 months postoperatively.	1.1403774316349147
According to our clinical and radiological score the results were excellent in 34 % of cases, good in 36.3 %, poor in 20.4 % and bad in 9 %.	1.295770098626633
Average fracture healing time was about 9.8 weeks.	0.9774690297772204
Fractures of the atlas account for 1-2 % of all vertebral fractures.	1.3155175237707257
We divide atlas fractures into 5 groups: isolated fractures of the anterior arch of the atlas, isolated fractures of the posterior arch, combined fractures of the anterior and posterior arch (so-called Jefferson fractures), isolated fractures of the lateral mass and fractures of the transverse process.	1.1649855142806418
Isolated fractures of the anterior or posterior arch are benign and are treated conservatively with a soft collar until the neck pain has disappeared.	1.1219290813531837
Jefferson fractures are divided into stable and unstable fracture depending on the integrity of the transverse ligament.	0.9505523626880445
Stable Jefferson fractures are treated conservatively with good outcome while unstable Jefferson fractures are probably best treated operatively with a posterior atlanto-axial or occipito-axial stabilization and fusion.	0.9627721414374935
The authors preferred treatment modality is the immediate open reduction of the dislocated lateral masses combined with a stabilization in the reduced position using a transarticular screw fixation C1/C2 according to Magerl.	0.9788897535084061
This has the advantage of saving the atlanto-occipital joints and offering an immediate stability which makes immobilization in an halo or Minerva cast superfluous.	0.8540902534675843
In late instabilities C1/2 with incongruency of the lateral masses occurring after primary conservative treatment, an occipito-cervical fusion is indicated.	0.9664814703509323
Isolated fractures of the lateral masses are very rare and may, if the lateral mass is totally destroyed, be a reason for an occipito-cervical fusion.	1.110554532639319
Fractures of the transverse processes may be the cause for a thrombosis of the vertebral artery.	1.1961239793982164
No treatment is necessary for the fracture itself.	1.0499069840210646
Reported is the case of a 36-year-old man with neurofibromatosis type 1 with lethal haemorrhage from rupture of the left common iliac artery.	1.1510680052723075
Histologically and immunohistochemically, no hints on angiodysplasia as a possible cause of bleeding were detected.	0.9830308117466219
Considering the literature and the histological findings in the area of rupture, a local weakness of the vascular wall caused by the neighbouring neurofibromatous proliferates was most probably the reason for bleeding.	1.1965137169799305
We report on a 2-year-old girl with chronic bullous disease of childhood (CBDC).	1.1274654320283561
Concomitantly with a feverish gastrointestinal infection caused by Salmonella enteritidis, the child presented with lesions resembling impetigo contagiosa on the legs and face.	0.9529876007454188
Following antibiotic treatment with cephalosporins p.o.	0.6417746597469365
she developed typical symptoms of CBDC, i.e.	0.5606925410704183
tense blisters on erythematous skin in the perineal area, on the flexor aspects of the thighs and upper arms and on the face.	0.9450430040713551
Direct immunofluorescence revealed a linear IgA deposition along the basement membrane zone, confirming the diagnosis of CBDC.	0.8267226055782434
These lesions cleared rapidly after treatment with dapsone p.o.	0.8345459840054148
This case prompted us to consider new aspects of the pathogenesis, clinical entity and treatment of this rare bullous disease of childhood.	1.1049730374614435
Systemic administration of strontium-89 is an important option for pain relief in advanced prostate carcinoma with multiple osseous metastases.	0.9595746593884915
Recently, rhenium-186-HEDP was introduced as a new substance which has important advantages (shorter physical half-life, scintigraphic imaging, dose distribution).	1.0908687523558624
The myelosuppressive effect can be estimated more accurately in advance, so that adverse effects can be reduced and the treatment can be repeated after a shorter period of time and more often.	1.1271601727227785
Our study comprises 15 treatments with rhenium-186-HEDP in advanced prostate cancer patients using the 1.4- to 2-fold standard dose.	1.1666050088507904
The response rate, estimated as reduction in pain and increase in patient mobility, was 87 % with no major myelosuppressive effects.	1.297326587668936
The mean duration of pain relief was 4-6 weeks.	1.0264035515754328
All four patients with repeated therapy were also responding to the second treatment.	1.0342645648945203
Radionuclide therapy for painful osseous metastases with rhenium-186-HEDP appears to be an effective and, even at higher doses, safe procedure.	1.1079677732777677
Cyclophosphamide is a potent immunosuppressive drug which is widely used to treat renal and central nervous system manifestation of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).	0.8574152875027483
It is employed especially to prevent renal failure in lupus nephritis.	0.8527777722087672
Within the last decade intravenous cyclophosphamide bolus therapy has become the standard therapy in severe SLE due to its tendency towards a higher efficacy and fewer side effects as compared to oral application.	1.1397468469334002
Studies on the slightly more cost-effective oral cyclophosphamide bolus therapy have recently been published, however, there are no data on long-term results yet.	1.1041721002880218
Here, we review the effects and side effects of cyclophosphamide as well as recent clinical studies on cyclophosphamide bolus therapy in SLE.	1.160437395655853
Because of the possible side effects, especially the high risk of malignancies, which sharply increases at a cumulative dose of approximately 60g, cyclophosphamide should be used cautiously.	1.159760718373435
Cyclophosphamide bolus therapy should only be performed in hospitals with special experience.	0.9536505035491226
The optimal time to perform acute ACL reconstruction with respect to arthrofibrosis is discussed.	0.9638723017103303
Most authors prefer delayed surgery.	0.4986976455400254
The definition of the term "acute" varies between 48 hours and 4 weeks.	0.9479468149748604
In this study the limit was set at 60 hours.	1.0682201155862374
Acute ACL reconstruction was performed in 39 patients and delayed surgery in 35 after they had regained full ROM.	0.9205678026898705
The incidence of arthrofibrosis was not higher in the acutely operated group whereas overall inability to work was 44% lower in this population.	1.0572877260406444
When the indication is clear, we think that acute ACL reconstruction may be performed within 60 hours without a higher risk of postoperative development of arthrofibrosis.	1.063646607966528
Nowadays, this strategy should also be considered for economic reasons.	1.1898777284517552
After some introductory remarks on the influence of psychosocial risk factors on the developmental outcome of premature infants this review summarizes the current knowledge about intervention programs for prematures and their parents with a special focus on parent-centered programs.	1.0404423933237612
Positive effects of intervention programs are found in an improvement of cognitive development, parental sensitivity and the home environment.	1.0127465768851476
Only parent-centered interventions enhanced the quality of parent-infant interaction.	0.8188263588733006
It is questioned if those effects are also reliable for very premature infants and are found in the long term.	0.9374331021956249
Further programs should focus on parent- and parent-infant centered interventions.	0.9071935433646439
Methodological problems of intervention studies and further research perspectives on parent-centered interventions are discussed.	0.910587014797764
The surgical therapy of the rupture of a distal biceps tendon and a modified postoperative treatment is described.	1.0698956993218098
Mainpoint is the early treatment in anaclisis of Kleinert as it is standardized in the treatment of ruptures of the flexor tendons of the hand.	1.022103046502157
A forearm orthesis with a simply ROM-joint without reboundmechanism was used.	0.7025385436977706
Possible benefits are shown and further industrial evolution seems to be indicated.	0.8168826395192486
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMP) are involved in important processes of tumor invasion and metastasis.	0.9984327316594803
In the study presented, matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) and 3 (MMP3), the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1) and the complex MMP1/TIMP1 were measured by ELISA tests specific for these proteins in blood plasma.	1.2731717255024972
These components have been investigated in prostate cancer patients (PCa) with metastases (n = 18; T2, 3, 4 pN1, 2M1), prostate cancer patients without metastases (n = 29; T2, 3 pN0M0), patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH; n = 29) and in healthy men (n = 35).	1.319454415832137
Mean values of MMP1 and of the complex MMP1/TIMP1 were not different among the four groups.	0.9102583686518884
The mean values of MMP3 and especially TIMP1 were significantly higher in prostate cancer patients with metastases compared with controls, BPH patients and prostate cancer patients without metastases.	0.9997081913779173
Ten of these 18 patients had TIMP1 levels higher than the upper reference limit.	0.8976861887817328
TIMP1 concentrations correlate to the tumor stage but not to the tumor grade.	1.097177444590272
These results indicate, that TIMP1 could be an potential marker for metastases in prostate cancer patients.	1.0585129948893415
The interventional occlusion of atrial septal defects still represents an experimental approach.	0.8338156031284427
As in all intracardiac implants able the double umbrella device (ASDOS) is affected by late complications, particularly when involving umbrella thrombosis and umbrella dislocations.	1.0659665017454898
The demonstration of 4 case reports shows that late postinterventional complications can manifest in unspecific cardial and noncardial symptoms in patients with an ASDOS device.	0.9081607605119918
The diagnosis of a late complication was in all cases confirmed by transesophageal echocardiography and represents an indication for immediate surgical explantation.	1.1746617328373847
For early diagnosis and safe handling of late complications after ASDOS implantation the knowledge of the emergency physician about postinventional problems of this device is essential.	1.0860483203597597
Every ASDOS patient who is suspected of suffering from late postinterventional complications should undergo immediate transesophageal echocardiography.	0.8878743557142696
The emergency physician should get in touch with the implantation center immediately.	0.8708069794224536
Furthermore, the concept of interventional occlusion therapy of atrial septum defects needs further development to avoid late complications.	0.9731045327159629
The goal of cardiocerebral resuscitation is to return to the pre-arrest level of neurological function and to reintegrate the patient into his former social circumstances.	0.9692461772095345
This study evaluated the long-term outcome of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in a country-area.	1.1304443793266896
The economic burden of congestive heart failure is significant.	0.760103424104695
Approximately 1 to 2% of total health care expenditure is attributed to the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of congestive heart failure.	1.1579560938695181
A great share of this expenditure is related to the costs of long-term complications and productivity losses.	1.0387918493972463
In order to manage these costs, providers and policymakers increasingly have to focus on economicaly attractive interventions.	0.822371538370206
Teleconsultation is a consultation between two or more physicians about the diagnostic work-up and therapeutic strategy in the treatment of an individual case by means of modern telematics.	1.0979264576069616
Due to more complex therapeutic strategies and legally defined formal requirements, the need for teleconsultation will increase significantly in the future.	1.00912313304134
Rapid technical improvements in telematics will progressively facilitate the practical performance of teleconsultation (based upon an ISDN network in the beginning, later on by the use of a national health network).	0.9391168456113158
The medicolegal aspects of teleconsultation have already been defined sufficiently for use in surgery.	0.8238992425298203
However, the question of adequate financial compensation for this type of medical service is still unclear.	1.0568861260030744
All 459 surgeons and orthopedists in private practice in Berlin (approx.	0.7044844510750259
3.5 Million inhabitants) were contacted in March 1997 and asked to cooperate.	1.1194230963764666
An 18-point questionnaire was sent out to record the physician's experience with atraumatic and posttraumatic neck complaints, which was returned by only 112 (25%).	1.0179307966338011
According to their assessment these physicians treated ca.	0.7597267621818237
47 000 atraumatic patients with cervical complaints and ca.	0.7304315336389356
7800 with a history of a preceeding trauma over a 12-month-period (1996).	0.9256985655580581
All responders had treated patients with posttraumatic complaints; about 60% stated having treated between 20 and 60 patients per year, 25% a smaller and 15% a greater number of patients.	1.233149142943334
The average treatment time was stated to be 2-5 weeks by 60% of the physicians, 10% listed a peak of 6-7 weeks and another 10% in excess of this peak.	1.274329631710282
Half of the physicians stated having also treated patients with a cervical trauma not caused by another person (a total of 500 cases).	1.1830389379338249
Symptoms/findings were considered as specific for a traumatic origin by ca.	0.9005607380615637
50% of the physicians and as nonspecific by the other half.	1.1662968491585413
It is noteworthy that the physician's point of view was influenced by personal accident experience (accident as a car passenger): 54% of the 26 physicians with posttraumatic cervical complaints considered these symptoms to be traumaspecific compared to only 35% of 40 physicians with accidents but without cervical symptoms.	1.0914970610165968
The statement that financial gains are frequently a motivating factor for patients that influenced the symptoms and course was confirmed by 22% of the physicians without accident experience compared to 62% of the physicians with accidents without cervical involvement.	1.1497701414571806
Of the physicians 32% were already familiar with personal cervical complaints in middle age unrelated to trauma and another 18% considered them sometimes a disease parameter.	1.1148268497413087
The "subject physician" in the context of "whiplash injury" is not yet sufficiently investigated but seems to be an interesting topic of further research.	1.2872647147723093
To measure dilation of large retinal branch vessels.	0.6474317234448618
The paper reminds of the many psychiatrists, neurologists, and pathologists connected with scientific work in neuropathology who were expelled from Germany between 1933 and 1939 because of defamation by the Nuremberg Laws or because of their political opposition.	0.9455078247303432
Many of these colleagues saw their only way out as suicide.	0.7673643740573223
Short biographies give an orientation about the destiny of the expelled physicians in their host countries.	0.8602674524684623
The effort made after 1945 to give these emigrated colleagues again an adaequate position in Germany have not been very intensive.	0.8317476994298826
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used as a diagnostic tool for special indications in oral and maxillofacial surgery.	0.9035216504206517
We describe a new MRI technique that presents images in a panoramic view analogous to orthopantomography.	0.9269011521390091
This technique is based on three-dimensional T1- and T2-weighted sequences.	1.0264260548465776
The familiar panoramic view in MRI provides better orientation and makes diagnosis faster and easier.	0.7535047320039562
However, the acquisition time is long (6-12 min per sequence), with a correspondingly high risk of motion artifacts.	1.3783784103405936
Moreover, the final workup is also time-consuming.	0.9974583327619081
These restrictions could be overcome by progress in hardware and software.	0.7093296377049619
There are promising indications for dental MRI.	0.6592528419309652
During recent years home ventilation has been shown to be useful for a growing number of patients with neuromuscular diseases and respiratory insufficiency caused by weakness of the respiratory muscles.	1.0840475596640633
Despite its technical simplicity, home ventilation leads to a number of social, ethical, medical and infrastructural problems.	0.9518331771441049
This consensus paper discusses the special situation of patients with neuromuscular diseases in home ventilation and describes the current thinking in the following topics: (1) definition of home ventilation; (2) aims of home ventilation; (3) indications and preconditions of home ventilation; (4) techniques and forms of home ventilatory support; (5) preparation for and practical questions of home ventilation; (6) stopping home ventilation.	1.045611546637829
Pseudo-obstruction of the colon is characterized by a massive colonic dilatation without mechanical obstruction.	0.8835483780932855
It is rarely after hip surgery, however, untreated it may be complicated by a life threatening perforation of the colon.	1.0721282732574733
In a retrospective analysis we reviewed 11 patients (4 women, 7 men, mean age 75.2 years, range 67 to 86 years) with pseudo-obstruction of the colon after hip surgery in the years 1995 to 1998.	1.2806722218595519
In relation to all patients aged 65 years and older who underwent surgery of the hip, the prevalence was 1.06%.	1.259418465897077
The leading clinical symptom was abdominal distension.	0.6445121790776291
On plain x-rays, dilatation of the colon measured 13.3 cm on average (9-16 cm).	1.106827384729119
In two patients (18%) adaequate application of drugs stimulating the gastro-intestinal motility was sufficient, whereas in 8 patients (73%) colonoscopic decompression had to be performed.	1.087246415901826
In three of these, the procedure failed and because of persistent symtoms a coecostomy was performed.	1.0646780390464643
One patient underwent immediate laparotomy because of peritonitis.	0.6780255099408964
2 patients (18%) died because of a complicated course.	1.0522116105484844
Non operative treatment should not exceed 24 hours, endoscopic decompression and tube placement is considered as the treatment of choice.	1.0161544861801233
In cases of failure of these procedures, perforation of the colon and/or peritonism, urgent laparotomy with open decompression by a coecostomy is essential.	0.9851056549865937
Anti-semitism increased from year to year in Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945.	0.7149035689349256
The fear of annihilation resulted in a surge of suicides.	0.6734824071438726
The suicides of at least 9 Jewish dermatologists has been documented.	0.7586603976833209
Their mean age was 65 years.	0.8796527814023379
Couples often committed suicide together.	0.4635575905504934
At the end of World War II, the head of the dermatological department of the Prague University committed suicide.	1.022078995419574
We assume the same happened in Rostock and Dresden.	0.6565559866976559
The president of the German Dermatological Society (DDG) committed suicide on March 27, 1945.	0.8540723488328591
The motives of these dermatologists were obviously the collapse of Nazism and the fear of relatiatory measures.	0.8497584066506637
Biocoral is a biomaterial derived from natural corals, and it has surgical applications.	1.013775075875363
Since 1992 the author has been using this material as a bone graft substitute in maxillofacial surgery.	0.8749000357140457
Seventy-seven clinical implantations were done for different indications.	0.8379762704631767
The results suggest that coral grafts are well tolerated and become partially ossified when the calcified skeleton is resorbed.	0.863841144483788
This material has been demonstrated to be successful.	0.9035316296672371
Aim: An overview on the evidence-based indications for an immunosuppressive treatment with azathioprine in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases is given.	1.2287187908506159
Background: The aim of the study was the evaluation of how ophthalmological diagnoses and the proportion of multiply handicapped children has changed within the last 20 years at a state school for visually handicapped and blind children.	0.9978567852951569
Introduction: Visual impairment as the initial symptom of leukemia is rare.	1.1117876935987725
Although retinal involvement during leukemia is frequent, a leukemic macular lesion is an exception.	0.9250077714771386
Introduction: It was our aim to evaluate the results of laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal hernia repair (TAPP) with regard to recurrent hernias treated in our department.	1.3557180482197349
Methods: Included were 276 operations for first or subsequent recurrence of inguinal hernia previously treated with suture repair.	0.9970257056663675
All final repairs were carried out using the TAPP technique.	0.6054782878988058
The data were collected prospectively.	1.005114139946627
The patients were examined 2 weeks and 1 year postoperatively.	1.1956547914487514
The rate of follow-up amounted to 78.1 % at 1 year after operation.	1.0774856154357986
Results: Perioperative complications were monitored prospectively and divided into intraoperative, minor and major.	1.0993785702583247
The overall complication rate amounted to 9 %, major complications 5.3 %.	1.0384532387975913
The re-recurrence rate was 0.4 %.	0.692280018840256
Conclusions: Because of the general advantages of laparoscopic surgery and the low recurrence rate we prefer laparoscopic hernioplasty using the TAPP technique.	1.0327318157810073
Diseases of the hindfoot are associated with considerable functional impairment and therefore may hamper patients' movements during gait considerably.	0.9872154677304008
Because of biomechanical overload, articular structures, tendons and ligaments are prone to early degenerative changes during the course of rheumatic diseases as visible with plain film radiography, sonography (US), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).	0.9307652802756362
Findings may occur as arthritis of major joints or in the form of fibroostitis and bursitis of the os calcis.	0.9939917829633123
Despite the progressive course of rheumatic diseases and characteristic imaging findings, high variability of X-ray signs may occur.	1.0297795752829382
Plain film radiograms and high-resolution ultrasonography play a key role in imaging rheumatic diseases of the hindfoot.	1.0061158396548633
MRI supports imaging diagnosis in selected cases.	0.6020905609593274
The principal goals of diagnostic imaging are precise and reproducible documentation of morphologic abnormalities and differentiated analysis for planning proper conservative or surgical treatment.	0.8447252814150862
Background: We evaluated the prevalence of the loss of visual acuity due to loss of the central portion of the visual field and foveolar fixation in the first week after glaucoma filtering surgery.	1.1832725295542807
The aim of the present study was to test polylactic acid material as a controlled release carrier for polypeptide growth factors.	0.9516935052847191
Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was incorporated into DL polylactic acid (PLA) pellets under hyperbaric CO2 pressure in two different ways.	0.8892589434899459
(1) Lyophilized bFGF was crushed and mixed with PLA granules, filled into cylindric moulds of 5 x 3 mm, and submitted to hyperbaric CO2 pressure.	0.8488806076569156
(2) Lyophilized bFGF was reconstituted in phosphate buffer, mixed with PLA granules, and relyophilized.	0.8986314153814614
In vitro assessment of bFGF release from the PLA implants by immunoassay showed that loading of PLA with crushed lyophilized bFGF resulted in a rapid and high release, while loading by solubilized bFGF and relyophilization led to a low and more regular release of the polypeptide growth factor.	0.9484205125679506
Intestinal neuronal dysplasia (IND) was initially described as a developmental abnormality of the submucous plexus in children.	1.0155172672173718
In recent years this abnormality has also been observed in adults with chronic constipation.	1.0163076487794436
The aim of this study was a morphometric characterization of this disease.	0.9182798965823681
The investigation was performed with 10 adults with IND, compared with 10 healthy control probands.	1.084629089795121
The best diagnostic indicator of IND proved to be the detection of 6-10 giant ganglia with more than 7 nerve cells in 15 biopsy sections.	1.093642433697895
IND is an interesting cause of chronic constipation which can be histologically verified.	0.989288804083573
Extracorporal shock-wave application (ESWA) has been used in the treatment of stones located in the kidneys, bile, pancreas and the glandula parotis.	0.7315218816460285
In the last 2 years several studies have shown the benefit of ESWA in the treatment of soft-tissue disorders and tendinosis calcarea.	0.8891707258715396
To date, the exact mechanism is unknown.	0.9493194494636187
Local hyperemia following damage or afferent inhibition is discussed.	0.6385429618350844
The possibilities and indications of ESWA with respect to several syndroms are presented.	0.9056569710674272
The results show the benefit of ESWA in the treatment of chronic soft-tissue disorders without severe side effects.	1.0667617492058772
Some patients showed small subcutaneous hematomas and erosion of the skin when energies about 20 mJ were used.	0.9510795268091257
Forty-seven of 84 of the patients obtained complete relief; 24 patients showed a marked reduction in their complaints.	1.1967877359130008
In only 13 of 84 cases was the treatment unsuccessful.	0.8529306320264898
Up to now there are no facts concerning the loosening rate of the cemented titanium stem (Trios).	0.9701153416926375

Management of laryngeal carcinoma located at the anterior commissure remains controversial.	0.7964242409023745
Local control rates with radiotherapy or surgery are not as good as those seen after treatment of midcord lesions.	0.9750859390968408
The vertical partial laryngectomy with epiglottic reconstruction (VPLER) may be a more successful approach to such lesions.	1.0357878062144403
The charts of all patients treated for larynx carcinoma between 1991 and 1996 at the authors' institutions were reviewed to identify those patients treated with VPLER as described by Sedlacek in 1965, Kambic in 1976 and Tucker in 1979.	1.0745154916843644
Indications for performing surgery and outcome data of patients were collected and analyzed according to the indications for surgery, surgical technique, perioperative complications, oncological outcomes and functional results.	1.1729171815617532
Twelve patients were identified that had been treated with VPLER.	0.9686998250651248
Indications for surgery included five patients with local recurrences following endoscopic laser partial laryngectomies, four cases with previously untreated primary tumors at the anterior commissure (T2 N0-2 M0), two with local recurrences following radiotherapy, and one with recurrence following frontolateral partial laryngectomy.	1.2474294943804327
There were no postoperative complications except for one laryngocutaneous fistula that required secondary repair.	0.962498939979091
All patients were able to swallow at the tenth postoperative day.	0.8332689190214593
All had their tracheostomies closed after completion of wound healing, (a mean of 17 days after surgery).	1.1093691430029573
Phonatory results were usually poor.	0.6316283392321517
Two local recurrences occurred during the follow-up period.	0.7107115636244381
However, both patients were salvaged with total laryngectomies and have since been free from disease.	1.2937033123268729
All other patients are alive and well.	0.687386186110303
Our findings show that VPLER is an effective surgical approach for carcinoma at the anterior commissure of the larynx that cannot be adequately managed with transoral laser surgery or simple frontolateral partial laryngectomy.	0.93727657779702
This study demonstrates that the procedure can be successfully applied to the treatment of local recurrences following initial raditherapy or surgery.	1.1623573205696758
No major complications occurred in our study.	0.9194556806434188
Traditionally, intra-vitam diagnosis of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) of brain supplying arteries is a domain of conventional selective angiography.	1.0103447280720845
We are aware of only two publications reporting of ultrasound displayed intimal and medial variants of carotid artery FMD, in one case each.	0.9585181094096661
We present a patient in whom color-coded duplex-sonography revealed a web-like carotid artery bulb stenosis meeting the specific criteria of a subtype of intimal FMD.	0.9076908877067766
The relationship between depression and the outcome of low back surgery was investigated.	1.0485205715083457
Data analysis was based on two assumptions: (1) Presurgical assessments of depression are correlated with the outcome of surgery, and, therefore, depression can be interpreted as a risk factor for surgical failure.	0.9243560835695956
(2) Postsurgical assessments of depression are correlated with the outcome of surgery, and therefore, depression can be interpreted as a response to treatment failure.	1.0205111020369106
The sample was made up of 78 patients who had undergone lumbar nucleotomy and 132 patients with lumbar spondylodesis.	0.9126905836700265
Treatment outcome was evaluated 6 months after surgery in the nucleotomy group and 9 months after surgery in the spondylodesis group.	0.95412250572715
Depression was assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).	0.7736875532848273
Measures of treatment outcome were an objective rating system for the surgical result, functional impairment, return to work, subjective estimations of the patient, and pain intensity.	1.1554863697968873
Presurgical depression scores showed no significant relationship with surgical outcome in nucleotomy patients.	0.9411936481538067
In spondylodesis patients, however, there was a significant negative correlation with the patients' subjective outcome ratings.	1.2361049182594048
Postsurgical depression scores, on the other hand, were significantly related to almost all of the outcome variables in both treatment groups.	1.1197486960413852
Patients with clinically relevant postsurgical depression scores were significantly more likely not to benefit sufficiently from surgery than those with clinically not relevant depression scores.	1.0382754518670245
Our findings favour assumption 2 over assumption.	0.5786908461885714
In the light of our findings, depressiveness is interpreted as a response to a non-beneficial outcome of surgery.	0.8795561329021434
The need for an interdisciplinary approach combining psychological counseling or treatment and physical therapy for those patients who do not benefit from surgery is discussed.	0.9257857239402564
Using electron-beam computed tomography (EBCT) with short exposure times of 100 or 50 ms and the capability of acquiring up to 2 x 17 images/s it is possible to study most of the important morphological and functional determinants of the heart.	1.1270041294955455
Various examples of studies in acute and chronic cardiac diseases are shown to demonstrate the use of EBCT to determine quantitatively left ventricular volumes (ml), myocardial mass (g), wall thickness changes over the cardiac cycle (mm/s), myocardial perfusion (ml/100 g/min) and the extent of coronary calcification (calcium score) and qualitatively the state of the proximal 4-6 cm of the subepicardial coronary arteries.	1.2522973404469653
The knowledge of these determinants seems very useful in excluding cardiac dysfunction, in the early recognition of cardiac disease and in the evaluation of the haemodynamic severity of coronary artery stenotic lesions.	1.1758005339535422
Further interdisciplinary studies are necessary to assess the clinical validity of these cardiac determinants, especially myocardial perfusion, using this advanced CT technology.	1.0993326400294052
Fractures and dislocations of the elbow are some of the most common injuries in childhood and adolescence.	1.2084217226471086
The majority occur in sport and play activities, e. g., a fall from gymnastics apparatus or a bike, or from popular sports items, such as skateboards or in-line skates.	0.9944107211345427
The injuries can be divided into pure dislocations of the joint and fractures of the distal humerus, proximal radius and ulna, or combinations of both.	1.1966102220859287
In addition, extra- and intraarticular fracture types are defined, with the latter as partial or complete joint lesions.	1.1966705365302903
Dislocations of the elbow joint or the radial head can occur as single injuries or in combination with a fracture.	1.0632505275441222
Supracondylar fractures and avulsion fractures of the medial epicondyle are the most frequent extraarticular lesions of the distal humerus.	1.231307029484537
Fractures of the lateral condyle prevail is incomplete intraarticular lesions.	0.9039922208973614
In the forearm, radial head and neck fractures are predominant while typical and atypical Monteggia injuries have a special status.	1.018236751981423
The complex joint construction and the age-dependent appearance of the epiphyseal ossification centers sometimes make a correct radiological diagnosis difficult.	1.016769943834801
The trauma history and an exact, clinical examination help to verify the injury, as do comparative X-ray studies of the uninjured side when necessary (but not routinely).	1.1854366958072986
Unlike other anatomical areas, most elbow injuries - even in the growing skeleton - are treated operatively.	1.3192987274209667
Hereby, the growth plates have to be respected using minimal amounts of small implants.	1.0603689747304106
Additional immobilization in a cast for 2 - 4 weeks is necessary in most cases but does not lead to a functional deficit - in contrast to adults.	1.2499057263650857
The implants should be removed as early as possible.	0.5603237788464144
Despite all therapeutic efforts, a significant number of late sequelae, such as malunions and functional impairment, can be seen.	1.164540486978005
The rate of long-term complications increases in cases of untreated displacement of fragments or joint instability.	1.0430900927119244
Corrective measures are performed only in selected cases and after the growth plates are closed.	1.0817264321213202
Our own treatment regime is demonstrated using exemplary clinical cases of the different injuries and the results of a long-term follow-up study on sports injuries of the elbow in children.	1.2432955928313778
Errors in diagnosis and therapy, as well as possible complications, are pointed out.	0.93074229534686
2-adrenergic agonists, mimicking the action of the inhibitory transmitter norepinephrine, cause antinociception due to postsynaptic inhibition of spinothalamic projection neurons, presynaptic inhibition at the central nervous system termination of primary sensory nerves, presynaptic inhibition of brainstem noradrenergic neurons and a generalized decrease in central nervous system sympathetic efferent activity.	0.9381949247433418
There is a mutual potentiation of antinociceptive effects of clonidine and morphine.	0.8204586375895789
Clonidine is used in chronic pain states for treatment of neuropathic, neuralgic and deafferentiating pain.	1.0275840528088374
Based on a meta-analysis of the studies published in the years 1996-1996, the therapeutic efficacy of systematically administered clonidine was evaluated in chronic pain states.	1.2444295166985169
Out of 403 screened published studies, only 9 fulfilled the selection criteria.	0.9444968290017588
Besides three case reports with successful clonidine treatment, four placebo-controlled studies could be analyzed treating the following chronic pain states: chest pain despite normal coronary angiograms; painful diabetic neuropathy; postherpetic neuralgia; hyperalgia in patients with sympathetically maintained pain and chronic low back pain.	1.0427264457336138
Although three studies demonstrated statistically significant improvement in pain scores, the improvement in pain relief in these cases was slight.	1.2358120450997012
Long-term treatment was successful in a few responders over a period of 17 months.	1.2863782264326538
Hyperalgesia caused by sympathetically maintained pain was relieved by topical (transdermal) application of clonidine.	0.8354207742437064
Based on this evaluation a grade C recommendation is derived, which relates to responders.	1.037554245134876
Successful treatment is expected only in pain states with increased sympathetic nervous system activity.	0.8962378108192696
Therefore, in chronic pain, treatment with systemic clonidine is of no significant value.	1.3285263625191697
Study objective: To investigate whether automatic tube compensation (ATC) or conventional pressure support (PS) is suit- able to compensate for the work of breathing imposed by the breathing circuit without altering the breathing pattern.	1.030574000886641
DNA-based prenatal testing of the fetal genotype was performed in a family at risk for recurrence of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB).	0.951564136027028
DNA from cultured fibroblasts and leukocytes from the peripheral blood of the previously affected offspring, DNA from parental leukocytes and DNA from fetal tissue obtained by chorionic villus biopsy was analysed by direct PCR amplification of known polymorphic regions within or flanking the type VII collagen gene, the canditate gene in RDEB.	0.9616853682600762
One flanking marker (D3S2/MspI) as well as two intragenic polymorphisms (C7/MspI, C7/Eco0109I) in exons 30 and 84 were informative in this family.	0.8949914221408716
Thus, based on the haplotype analysis and the lack of evidence for locus heterogeneity in RDEB, a phenotypically healthy child was predicted.	1.1013824535077401
This prediction was confirmed by the birth of a healthy female infant.	0.8769474644484772
The study reports successful determination of the fetal genotype by PCR-based prenatal diagnosis in a family at risk for recurrence of severe RDEB.	1.0018797589732296
Endothelins are peptides with powerful vasoconstrictor and mitogenic properties.	0.6061398579244661
It has become evident that endothelins are involved in many regulatory mechanisms of the circulation role both in short and in long term.	1.074905205153677
However, in many cases it remains unclear whether the alteration of the endothelin metabolism is a primary pathology or a secondary phenomenon.	1.266259456201986
The synthesis of endothelin receptor antagonists and animal models with altered endothelin metabolism have opened a new era of endothelin research that will allow insight into the mechanisms of endothelin-action and eventually might lead to new therapeutic concepts.	0.949646284644741
This review discusses the evidence both in favor and against pathogenic effects of endothelins in cardiovascular disease.	0.8543719711441479
The combination of fast MR sequences and rapid i. v. injection of paramagnetic contrast media provides information on cerebral perfusion.	0.9458324341834247
MR-perfusion imaging primarily depicts the relative cerebral blood volume.	0.7618353339364364
The aim of this study was to test whether MR-perfusion imaging with a clinical MR scanner using a standard 2D-FLASH sequence provides clinically relevant information on patients with cerebrovascular diseases and brain tumors.	1.0709991300535626
Brain infarctions, lesions in cerebral microangiopathy and occlusions of the carotid artery with very poor collateralization showed definite differences in perfusion imaging compared with normal controls.	0.9709728310752427
However, our results show that acceleration of the imaging sequence and optimization of the contrast bolus and data processing are prerequisites for the clinical use of this method, which in principle may provide information on the absolute cerebral blood volume and even blood flow.	1.2595833766976943
Lumbar Microdiscectomy requires special instruments and provides a good view with a narrow approach.	0.8320675449965849
The microscope is the best surgical aid.	0.8715546211620393
Alternatives are a retractorintigrated light or headlamp.	0.6115642732496523
A specific complication of lumbar microdiscectomy - the wrong level - can be minimized by an exact preoperative planning.	1.2579548300341783
Other complications like dural lesions and exessive bleeding are less frequent with the microscope because of the better view.	0.8975476194925024
The most severe complications that can occur with any lumbar disc operation, major vessel or visceral injury, can be avoided by lusing the new rongeur with a depth guard.	1.104908761295353
From January 1987 to March 1994 three hospitals in the city of Magdeburg treated a total of 103 subcutaneous Achilles tendon ruptures operatively.	0.9164694739233507
We created a special score to compare the outcome of the different operation techniques used.	1.139060148959269
Important aspects of the follow-up examination were isokinetic measuring of power and staying power by means of a KIN-TREX dynamic measuring device and the clinical check-up in comparison with the histological results and the patients' history.	1.256690223647647
Degeneration could only be proved histologically in 38,8 % of the cases.	0.9085872114637641
The average score of all OP methods applied was 767 of possible 1000 points.	0.7528822092832843
The adaptation suture (781 points), Silfverskiold's technique (772 points) and the fibrin adhesive technique (754 points) showed approximately the same results.	1.19794799980791
The theory that all of the ruptures have a histological degeneration background seems to be wrong.	0.939566592399101
Isokinetic measuring can be very helpful in preparing a postoperative regimen to find the optimum load.	0.9170881505438708
To determine wether a somatic dysfunction of head joints depends from segmental muscle strain, we investigated 89 patients before, during and after general anesthesia.	1.05010785412586
We examined the disturbed joint motion as exclusive criterion for a somatic dysfunction, because through an anesthesia with endotracheal intubation including complete neuromuscular blockade segmental influences on the inspected joint were eleminated.	0.9790843960096217
For complete muscle relaxation as required for orotracheal intubation a non depolarizising muscle relaxant was used.	0.8199924922842593
Somatic dysfunctions were found most frequent for side-inclination and retroflexion in segment O/C1.	0.7889074269582106
Both before as well as during complete neuromuscular blockade could be found in the majority of examinations (89,1 %) similar restraints of joint motions.	1.1990642050747922
To 10,9 % were found, that somatic dysfunctions established before the muscle relaxant was applicated, were no more demonstrable under complete blockade of neuromuscular transmission.	1.1794076179058157
Different theoretical models are presented for the interpretation of our results.	0.9404441878268641
We assume, that the disturbance of one component of the metamer organized segment is the basic phänomenon of somatic dysfunction.	0.9745305914346668
This disturbance break through the spinal segmental inhibition and expand into the segment.	0.7501626270569431
Subsequently we discuss to replace the term "somatic dysfunction" through "segmental dysfunction" and to define it as increasing of nozizeptive afference in the segment over a determined period of time with breakthrough of the spinal segmental inhibition threshold.	1.1310889266331499
Postoperative intestinal atonia is a complication which is likely to occur in patients predisposed for constipation and in patients after intra-abdominal operations.	1.0715273455284684
The postoperative delay of bowel movement, however, is often also related to the type of anaesthesia being used.	0.9528195580887302
In order to evaluate the magnitude of an anaesthetic-induced postoperative delay of bowel movement, two types of intravenous-based anaesthesia using fentanyl/midazolam (1 mg/25 mg; dosage 0.1 ml/kg/h), and ketamine/midazolam (250 mg/25 mg; dosage 0.1 ml/kg/h) respectively were compared with a volatile anaesthetic technique (enflurane; mean concentration 1.5 vol%).	1.03252441504868
In three groups of patients (each n=15) undergoing elective surgery of the lower extremities, induction of anaesthesia was accomplished with methohexital (1 - 1.5 mg) followed by succinylcholine (1.5 mg/kg) to facilitate intubation.	1.1618574663934127
For the maintenance of muscle relaxation vecuronium bromide was used.	0.7033238894575358
All patients were given droperidol to prevent postoperative emesis, and they were artifically ventilated with N2O/O2 (60: 40) to normal end-expiratory CO2 concentrations.	1.270233618832279
No anticholinergic agents were used at the end of operation since they are known to interfere with bowel motility.	0.9165295249758847
In order to determine gastro-intestinal motility, the H2 exhalation test was used.	1.0845500540413944
For this purpose 40 g lactulose in 100 ml of water was given to all patients via a gastral tube shortly before extubation.	0.9841828253844253
Lactulose is broken down by bacteria once it enters the colon, and H2 is released, taken up by the vascular system and exhaled.	0.9964051884376115
Postoperatively, patients were asked to exhale into a 20-ml syringe every 10 min.	0.8480343000246138
The content was analysed for hydrogen (ppm), using an electrochemical sensor (GMI exhaled hydrogen monitor).	1.0795656991016658
From the time of lactulose instillation to a threefold increase in endexpiratory hydrogen concentration (compared to the preoperative value), gastro-coecal transit time was computed.	1.0892828101177825
All three groups of patients were comparable in age, height and body weight.	1.102120829132729
Also, the duration of operation was comparable in all three groups.	1.091559183257315
Mean gastro-coecal transit time was 204 ( +/- 19.6 SD) min following enflurane, 302 ( +/- 32.8 SD) min following fentanyl/-midazolam and 210 ( +/- 28.8 SD) min following ketamine/midazolam anaesthesia.	0.9702258145206331
The gastro-intestinal inhibition after the opioid-based anaesthetic technique was significantly prolonged (p<0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test).	0.8624363879201797
There was no significance between patients after ketamine-based anaesthesia and those who had the volatile anaesthetic.	1.1292921701272234
When using intravenous anaesthesia with an opioid, gastro-intestinal inhibition, especially in patients prone to have constipation, is likely to develop postoperatively.	1.1265664501773678
In classical neuroleptanaesthesia and in analgosedation in the ICU, the simultaneous use of the butyrophenone droperidol seems to counteract the inhibition of opioid-related gastrointestinal motility.	1.0015511411313964
In cases of opioid-related gastrointestinal atonia a gastrokinetic compound may be necessary to overcome this effect on intestinal motility.	0.9370857422410535
In a prospective study 20 patients were monitored with serial sonograms and radiographs during distraction osteogenesis at the lower limb.	0.9813126437076246
All sonograms were obtained in four planes using a 7.5 MHz transducer.	0.9991550988518897
The distraction gap was seen as a sonolucent area in all patients after corticotomy.	1.0828508506748806
At an average of 20.7 (14-28) days after the beginning of the distraction, echogenic foci occurred and showed increasing longitudinal alignment with further distraction.	1.243161787662235
Radiographical signs of beginning mineralization were seen an average of 48.3 days after the start of the distraction.	1.1065711498989468
Exact measurement of the distraction gap was possible in all patients during lengthening.	1.1637288255400855
Bone healing complications and hematoma could be detected by ultrasound.	0.8065734493923423
A rapid increase of bone mineralization was seen after the distraction was stopped.	0.919575276169846
With increasing cortication of the regenerate bone, sonograms showed a hyper-reflecting solid line so that further mineralization and the time of removal of the fixator could not be assessed by ultrasound.	0.9865137070487238
Ultrasound is more sensitive than radiography in identifying new bone formation during distraction, measuring the length of the distraction gap, and detecting early bone-healing complications and can therefore reduce the need for radiographs.	1.0608114906872341
The interval between the onset of symptoms in patients with head and neck cancers and the introduction of treatment was evaluated.	0.9926663270343995
During a 1-year period, patients were interviewed to determine the duration of any delays from the onset of complaints until the first visit to a doctor.	1.148729801710765
Also asked was how long it took to be referred to an ENT specialist and actual referral to our department.	0.8072135501813679
We then determined the interval from diagnosis to the introduction of therapy.	1.0311065610670793
It was found that the delay of patients who went directly to an otorhinolaryngologist was shorter (median, 8 weeks) than that of patients who first went to their family doctors (median, 13 weeks) (P<0.02).	1.2627990249681467
The latter then took an additional 4 weeks before sending patients to an otorhinolaryngologist.	0.8830146023584043
Referral from the ENT specialist to our department took another 2 weeks, as well as our staging and pre-therapeutic management.	0.9202633756829371
Our findings show that the patient himself is the critical factor in delaying diagnosis and therapy.	0.9564998601289135
Tumor patients with greater professional qualification went to their doctors earlier (P<0.0001) or more often went directly to an ENT specialist (P<0.002).	1.0223052288858145
Consultations of physicians without experience in otorhinolaryngology caused yet further delays.	0.7700001406375367
The present study deals with long-term dimensional changes in cemented Müller-type total hip endoprostheses.	1.0143187798360593
Creep and wear contribute to different extents to the dimensional changes in polyethylene.	0.7516718294791392
The total amount of polyethylene wear is represented by the displacement of the femoral head into the socket.	0.8279966420734192
Within the first postoperative years, the head shifts up to a relatively high rate of about 0.5 mm per year.	1.3787600827126434
This rate diminishes after 5 years to an average of about 0.1 mm (ceramics) and 0.2 mm (metal) per year.	1.2017397631361526
Values exceeding 0.2 mm per year for the shift of the femoral head are considered to be unfavourable with regard to a probable loosening of the prosthesis.	1.0521528357158136
In this study we determined the orientation of the centre of the prosthetic head in relation to the wire marker of the polyethylene cup, comprising in all 369 total hip prostheses.	1.1400984920534067
After an average of 77 months, 96 % of the prostheses with ceramic heads (n = 109) had a wear rate of less than 0.2 mm per year.	1.1992003023560256
Using metal heads (Protasul-2 and Protasul-10) this rate could only be measured in 71 % (n = 109) of the prostheses (61.5 months).	1.2582262603412473
The combination ceramics-polyethylene produces half of the total amount of wear produced by metal-polyethylene.	0.8866200617723832
Younger patients should preferably be treated with a ceramic ballhead.	0.9825689249268819
The so-called amyopathic dermatomyositis is a rare variant of dermatomyositis which has attracted increasing interest during the last years.	0.9099910197531377
One finds the classical signs of dermatomyositis such as periorbital edema and erythema, erythematous macular and papular lesions localized at bony prominences (so-called Gottron's papules), generalized pruritus, photosensitivity, and a cutaneous histopathologic picture compatible with skin lesions of dermatomyositis.	1.0787339236635354
Crucial for the diagnosis is the exclusion of myositis by clinical examination, EMG and histology.	1.0670294432822225
Furthermore, longterm supervision of patients is advisable in order not to miss the appearance of early signs of myositis.	1.1274570062940488
The longest reported follow-up of amyopathic dermatomyositis patient is 4 years; however, it cannot be excluded that these cases will eventually culminate in classical dermatomyositis.	1.1260715097576839
In this paper we describe two cases and discuss the differential diagnosis and therapy; also, the term "Premyopathic dermatomyositis" is proposed, to indicate that the full picture is to be expected in most cases.	1.3176773852443073
The primary renal angiosarcoma is a rarely seen highly malignant tumor.	0.8896168234499257
Making a diagnosis based on histology may prove difficult.	0.6484867018059978
Because of hematogenous formation of metastases and bad prognosis in most cases we recommend that the surgical intervention be followed by the well tolerated systemic chemotherapy with Doxorubicin and Ifosfamid.	1.1374438108431464
This study compares the results of the outpatient-based program of the Cochlear Implant Center Ruhr with inpatient-based rehabilitation, which is almost exclusively performed in Germany.	1.0559435492347067
The Department of Otorhinolaryngology at the University of Essen in Germany provided 52 patients with either 22- or 24-channel Nucleus cochlear implants from March 1996 to July 1999.	1.114898786694398
Almost all patients (n=49) were rehabilitated on an outpatient basis, which is the standard in many cochlear implant centers outside Germany.	1.2207223682342225
Syringe drivers are used in anaesthetics, intensive care and emergency medicine to deliver small volumes of highly potent drugs with continuous, constant and reproducible flow.	0.9522694012817055
For early recognition of interruptions of the drug delivery caused by occlusion of the infusion system, an alarm is triggered as soon as the system pressure exceeds a certain limit.	1.0576360891492809
The sensitivity of this alarm depends on the flow rate, type-specific cut-off pressure and the elastic parameters of the infusion system.	1.1211516944145237
The sudden release of pressure built up in the system after occlusion occurred can cause delivery of an uncontrolled drug bolus and hence an additional hazard.	0.9587272020076019
Methods: Six syringe drivers that are widely used in clinical practice were tested for alarm delay and bolus delivery in the event of an occlusion in the system.	1.2064775164482877
First, the alarm pressures at flow rates of 10, 50 and 100 ml/h were measured.	1.1242630377712486
Then the alarm delay time and bolus volumes post-occlusion were assessed, using a basic infusion system (syringe+single infusion set).	0.9593262506686066
Finally, several alterations to the system like extension, tap battery with germ filters or branching were made and their impact on alarm delay and bolus volume measured.	0.9853527828143134
Results: Because of the great differences in alarm pressures between the devices tested, there were marked differences in the alarm delay at same flow rates.	1.1805224895273492
Predictably, there was an indirect proportional link between alarm delay and flow rate.	1.2157468986465239
Using the basic infusion system, alarm delays between 23 s and 143 min were measured.	0.707621887174942
In two of the tested syringe drivers, a pressure-release mechanism is activated with the pressure alarm, which prevented bolus application.	1.1874301599389558
In the other devices, release of the pressure in the occluded system caused boli of 0.5-7 ml.	1.2222855343272743
Variations in the actual syringe volume and insertion of a second connection tube had no impact on alarm delay and bolus volume.	0.862028262793873
Tap batteries, parallel running syringe drivers or trapped air in the system, however, caused marked increase in both alarm delay (107%) and bolus volume (+147%).	1.09135545630325
Discussion: Unidentified occlusions of the system cause grave malfunctioning of syringe drivers.	0.9838126255782168
While applying highly potent drugs, the discontinuation of drug delivery with subsequent bolus application can cause vital danger to the patient.	0.914055829146233
As a result of the significant time delays in the pressure alarms, the devices tested do not provide sufficient protection against unrecognized system occlusion.	1.075950633174784
Syringe drivers with adjustable alarm pressure can be set close to the actual infusion pressure.	0.8404838462151961
A further important point is that one should aim at a reduction in the elastic properties of the infusion set because of the great impact on alarm delay and bolus volume.	0.9855270668877876
Because the overall results of conservative treatment for distal radial fractures have been unsatisfactory, it is rarely used.	1.1289906672182717
However, minimally invasive methods such as stabilization by external fixation and percutaneous K-wire pinning are being increasingly used.	1.1706615464748797
A justified indication for the use of K-wire pinning is that it provides an opportunity to achieve good and very good short- and long-term anatomic and functional results.	1.0636125640063252
Short-term supplementary immobilization with a minimized plaster cast or protective external fixation is generally considered to be useful.	1.0211196842565438
Reports on plaster-free functional treatment after K-wire pinning have been published.	0.8818178554945626
The indications therefore need to be further specified.	0.8106324402150235
Follow-up studies and an analysis of our patients show a strong increase in K-wire stabilization and good-to-very good results in 75% of the cases.	1.3000322893272604
Involvment of the genitouronary tract by lymphoproliferative disorders is rare.	0.6951229483995911
Rapid proliferating Burkitt's lymphomas could mimic acute diseases.	0.5728447768663397
Due to the extreme chemosensitivity, the lymphoma is cureable and surgery should be done only for histology.	1.0196545131713755
Initial surgery should be restricted to acute abdominal complications or complete removal of localised resectable disease.	0.7843984354390716
In any case a multiagent chemotherapy is necessary.	0.7122358189844261
Wet autoclaving is a simple, reliable and time-effective method for antigen retrieval in routinely processed archival material.	0.8992121835383973
Both routine diagnostic (e. g., oestrogen and progesterone receptors, cytoskeletal proteins) and research antibodies (e. g. various p53 antibodies, mdm-2, bcl-2, MIB-1) are reported to demonstrate its application.	1.053806112919918
Wet autoclaving may allow successful application of antibodies in paraffin-embedded tissues designed for use on frozen sections.	0.857320099608304
The technique has the poten-tial to reliably handle up to 200 sections at a time, without evidence of any significant damage to the sections or nuclear morphology.	1.0555760115033672
Classical stable plate osteosynthesis with its anatomical repositioning, absolute stability between fragments and medial support should only be applied to joint fractures and spongy bone.	0.9885457172398929
In cortical bone, the anatomical reposition connected with the plate promotes bone necrosis along the fracture and prevents callus formation.	0.9950745744885283
Direct cortical synthesis, a method also known as "primary bone healing", serves the bone's revascularisation and is not necessarily aimed at healing.	1.1541623150500868
Thus, this may also be termed "necrosis healing".	1.1157338771688148
Along the shaft of long bones, elastic plate osteosynthesis, a biological method, is safer than and superior to the rigid technique.	1.0610492366372362
This even applies to short oblique and transverse fractures insofar as nailing does not appear feasible.	0.7390888602819553
Elasticity is achieved by leaving a flexible stretch of at least 2 - 4 holes, i.e.	0.9510097999528092
as long as possible, without screws over the fracture and by employing a titanium plate.	0.9573544876146288
Thus, there is no punctate fatigue leading to plate breakage.	1.0560862602721774
The fitting of third fragments is deliberately left out.	0.6208882316407696
The same applies to all kinds of compression with lag screws, tension devices or DC-gliding holes - and this with the intention of allowing micromovements in the fracture's fissure.	1.0066473351414569
Periost and muscle are not removed and the fracture is not examined.	0.9074444655531366
Healing occurs spontaneously via a fixating callus forming within the first 3 - 6 weeks out of the periost-soft tissue combination.	1.1101418564614831
Histomorphological investigation dates the first woven- bone bridges between the fragments to 3 weeks subsequent to the accident.	0.9292625201544504
In Göttingen University trauma centre, 87 fractures have been attended to over 2 years using this technique.	0.8685057768117274
Despite considerable soft-tissue damage, no delayed bone healing, pseudoarthrosis or bone infection has been observed.	0.8481290184052397
The risks of elastic plate osteosynthesis lie in unbiological and exaggerated reposition methods, too short a flexible stretch, and insufficient anchorage of the screws.	1.0597037930276374
Diagnosis of a thrombosis in the peripheral veins can now be made with almost 100% certainty using either phlebography or duplex sonography.	1.0947765468506396
A correct diagnosis depends on the expertise of the examiner.	0.7831372674392587
Both methods are available throughout Germany.	0.8649979639635942
Although both are equally suitable for primary diagnostic investigations, duplex sonography has assumed an important role due to the fact that it is not invasive.	1.130770138924347
Phlebography is vital if there are specific issues that need to be clarified.	0.7352541233678495
This applies if invasive treatment methods are being considered, if an expert opinion is required or if scientific issues need to be determined.	1.0413176261538868
Discrepancy between clinical findings and the results of duplex sonography also constitutes an important indication for phlebography.	1.022036447946208
In many institutions, both methods are used in a "golden partnership" in cases in which it is important to obtain comprehensive records.	1.2892376444272617
For frequent ventricular ectopic beats, currently, reassurance and pharmacological therapy are the mainstays of treatment.	1.0193716173775313
This study assesses the useful role of catheter ablation in eliminating frequent monomorphic ventricular ectopic beats in severely symptomatic patients.	0.8594268888402224
Catheter ablation was performed in 65 patients with frequent drug refractory ventricular ectopic beats.	0.9728080423638321
The site of origin of ventricular ectopic activity was accurately mapped by using pace mapping, earliest endocardial activation time, and unipolar mapping.	0.9703814030423126
In 5 patients a new non-contact mapping was additionally performed.	0.8794530881993434
The ectopic focus was located in the right ventricular outflow tract in 37 and in the left ventricle in 28 patients.	1.06703084828355
Ventricular ectopic beats were successfully eliminated by catheter ablation in 49/65 patients (75%).	0.8575484259551668
During a mean follow up of 13 +/- 11 months, 9 of 49 successful ablated patients (18%) had a recurrence.	1.188195757685121
Radiofrequency catheter ablation can be successfully used to eliminate ventricular ectopic activity.	0.9194910726689423
It may, therefore, be a reasonable alternative for the treatment of severely symptomatic, drug resistant monomorphic ventricular ectopic activity.	1.1144266457193832
Injuries of the forefoot are a challenge for orthopaedic surgeons.	1.0054607023862652
After healing of bone and soft tissue damage, posttraumatic metatarsalgia can persist.	0.86733727004062
The paper presents a therapy algorithm with newly designed insoles, which consist of the common orthopaedic adaptions like a rocker bottom and a stiffening of the sole.	1.0078462794234702
The therapy is shown on two cases.	0.7902344007449549
With these orthotics adequate is possible and pain relief realistic.	0.8887306703517374
Background: Myopic PRK up to 6 D is an approved and safe procedure.	1.236783267539091
The efficacy and safety of combined treatment of myopia and astigmatism in compound myopic astigmatism (PARK) have not yet been demonstrated.	0.9699406886445179
Nitric oxide (NO) can play an important role in the regulation of vascular tone and neurotransmission, as well as in non-specific immunoreactions and inflammation in a variety of tissues.	1.0122420996103565
Increased quantities of nitric oxide in respired air can be measured during inflammatory processes.	0.8248669132410823
However, the exact role and precise sources of NO under physiological and pathophysiological conditions within the airways remain to be defined.	1.0179048910821467
We report on a 55-year old patient who presented with a four month history of intermittent left thoracic painful attacks which radiated in the left arm.	1.179376087030808
Both normal 12 lead electrocardiogram and treadmill stress tests showed no significant ST changes.	0.8379985211752505
A thallium-201 scintigraphy afterwards disclosed a non-transmural septal ischemia.	0.7094377987210255
The consecutively performed diagnostic catheterization revealed a severe, almost pouch-like proximal aneurysm of the right coronary artery with a maximal diameter of 15-20 mm as well as an aneurysmatic modified left coronary artery and an impaired left ventricular function (EF 49%).	1.1044109163039029
In the absence of coronary artery stenosis, the patient was treated conservatively with an ACE inhibitor (lisinoprile 20 mg/day) under accompanying effective anticoagulant therapy with coumadin.	1.1403188501316575
With this strategy the patient has been asymptomtic during the eight month follow-up period.	0.9356386046377999
We investigated in 17 children (mean 7.1 years) the continuous administration of tramadol following augmentation cystoplasty or exstrophy reconstruction.	1.1102753937450058
Mean duration of the tramadol administration on the pediatric ward was 3.8  +/-  1.1 days (initial dosage 0.25 mg/kg/per hour, dose adjustment by the nursing staff).	1.2408153922614082
Mean tramadol consumption was 0.21 mg/kg/h on day 1 and was reduced to 0.08 mg/kg/per hour on day 4.	1.1635966176146346
Median pain score (assessed with ten-step scales) was 5 before treatment and between 2.5 (day 1) and 0.5 (day 5) during therapy.	1.3223019104504754
Lowest oxygen saturations (mean) ranged from 93.8 % to 95.2 %.	1.1518243675779114
Three patients (17.6 %) suffered from nausea/vomiting on 3 of 64 treatment days (4.7 %).	0.9830727702606943
Pruritus and extreme sedation did not occur.	0.5383771675908819
The continuous administration of tramadol is a simple and safe procedure following major urological surgery in children.	0.9101190826827908
Over the past 5-7 years, there has been a renewed research interest into the mechanism as well as the development of newer "emerging" treatment modalities for atrial fibrillation.	1.1910023149610969
One of these novel therapies is the implantable atrial defibrillator.	0.9515739080350506
In this article we will review the basic and clinical research which has been used in the development of electrode systems and shock waveforms utilized by commercially-available implantable atrial cardioversion devices.	1.0298302999368107
In 26 patients with abscesses in the maxillofacial area, the electrolyte concentrations, pH and osmotic and hydrostatic pressures of the pus fluid were measured and calculated.	0.9436231918322445
The main cations identified were sodium (134  +/-  38 mmol/l) and potassium  (37  +/-  16 mmol/l) and as anions chloride (183  +/-  46 mmol/l) and bicarbonate (10  +/-  4 mmol/l).	1.153144603137929
The pH value of the pus liquid was 6.164  +/-  0.233.	0.9513249323173208
The calculated mean osmotic pressure of the pus liquid was 7910  +/-  1455 mm Hg, whereas the measured physical pressure inside the abscess was 49  +/-  13 mm Hg.	1.034704646134853
Both pressure types show time-dependent pressure curves.	0.900635907942753
With time, the real pressure inside the abscess cavity increases, whereas the osmotic pressure decreases.	1.0562668384007836
There was no relationship between the two pressure types and the different species of microorganisms responsible for the inflammation.	1.1425833018889018
The results of the study reveal that abscesses can be regarded as osmotically active systems, and the mechanism by which the abscess is formed might be as follows.	1.2170676706603787
After penetration of virulent microorganisms into the tissue space, the area of acute inflammation is walled off by the collection of inflammatory cells.	1.0123205263448507
Destruction of tissue by products of the polymorphonuclear leucozytes takes place and results in liquefactive necrosis and a hypertonic abscess cavity.	0.8782813044074422
The inwards-directed flow of tissue fluids into the cavity via the abscess membrane causes volume expansion and generates pressure, two facts that can explain the swelling dynamics and typical symptoms of abscesses in the maxillofacial area.	0.9380807083608561
Internal mammary artery (IMA) bypass grafts have a satisfactorily long lasting blood supply to the myocardium.	0.8242467467868747
Their initial flow capacity can be insufficient with subsequent regional myocardial ischemia.	0.8117028041498779
This study represents a feasable surgical method to evaluate the effectiveness of the IMA graft function by temperature measurement of the heart during warm reperfusion after hypothermic cardioplegia.	1.0427758736758679
Twenty-five patients with multi-vessel coronary artery disease underwent coronary artery bypass grafting using the IMA as an arterial graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery and saphenous vein grafts to the remaining coronary arteries.	1.0783190796255826
Distal anastomoses were installed during cold intermittent blood-cardioplegic  arrest.	0.6941096976596111
After unclamping the aorta and IMA graft, the temperatures in cardiac front and rear sides were measured during the first five minutes of warm reperfusion.	1.0002936834755585
A sufficient IMA graft function was expressed by a typical rise of temperature: The cardiac front and rear sides showed a parabolic and exponential course, respectively.	0.9188883591056684
The rewarming speed expressed as the first derivative of temperature over time led to a sharp and early peak for the front side, and a smaller and delayed peak for the rear side.	1.128421583860514
An insufficient IMA graft function could be recognized by atypical temperature courses.	0.7654907260679823
Fabry's disease (Angiokeratoma corporis diffusum) is a rare X-chromosome linked recessive disorder belonging to the group of sphingolipoidoses.	0.971529081078461
The basic defect involves the gene encoding alpha-galactosidase.	0.7245106620073701
Because this enzyme is responsible for decomposition of glycosphingolipids, its deficiency results in their accumulation in endothelial and smooth muscle cells.	0.8938016490186657
With time, generalized angiokeratomas, paresthesias, renal and cardiac insufficiency and cerebrovascular complications develop.	0.971533709295073
We report a patient who in addition to the well-described findings also showed unique nail fold capillary changes not described so far.	1.0205238785495938
Analysis of serum concentration of alpha-galactosidase identified three female heterozygous carriers in the patient's family.	0.952632237171125
Benign, proliferative changes of the Brunner's gland are very rare and account for about 10 % of duodenal bulb neoplasias.	1.0712451022188492
The authors present a case of Brunner's gland adenoma of unusual dimensions (12 x 5 x 2.5 cm).	1.1278221993467952
The patient presented with vague epigastric discomfort as isolated symptoms.	0.5956848962123298
In this case we performed surgical treatment, including a duodenotomy and polypectomy.	1.1739911428761323
Because they are localized in the submucosa small, superficial endoscopic biopsies may fail to confirm the diagnosis.	0.7764520267172422
Malignancy seems to occur only very rarely, with only 14 cases reported in the literature.	0.9816738086908463
As the majority of Brunner's adenomas are quite small, endoscopic polypectomy will confirm the diagnosis and cure the condition in most cases.	1.119002651321463
Large symptomatic adenomas may require surgical resection.	0.6256071920865157
Objective: How does adjuvant training of strength and endurance influence the muscular, cardial, respiratory, immunological systems, and the quality of life during intrahepatical chemotherapy in a veteran athlete with liver metastasis after resection of a carcinoma of the rectum.	1.1357237234332274
Patient and method: A 58-year-old athlete with metastatic carcinoma of the rectum (pT3, N0, M-liver, G2) underwent regional chemotherapy (folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil) via an intrahepatic port system.	1.2408293397353052
Six cycles with 5 days each were applied.	0.7501715062762988
During the intervals between cycles (14 days), beginning in the 6th postoperative week, a strength and endurance training (duration 13 weeks) was carried out twice weekly with an intensity of 40-60 % of the maximum postoperative individual power and endurance (evaluated with weight and treadmill exercise tests and measurement of lactate).	1.1367580829810953
Before and after chemotherapy, an echocardiogram, resting and exercise electrocardiogram, lung function, natural killer cells and the gastrointestinal quality of life index (GLQI) was evaluated.	1.0514521160367445
After chemotherapy was finished, the effects of training were assumed.	0.9369048449389703
Results: Strength increased between 0 % and 144 %.	1.3602779062046808
Endurance improvement was measured on the last comparable submaximal intensity step, expressed by reduction of heart rate and lactate concentration by 10 and 21.5 %, respectively, improvement of lung function regarding FEV 1 and FCV by 12.9 and 11.3 %, respectively, and VC IN 11.4 %.	1.1559075940907442
The relative count of natural killer cells increased by 27.2 %, and the GLQI improved from 109 points (pathologic) to 129 points (normal).	1.0498718997320207
Conclusion: There were positive effects on muscular and cardial mechanisms of adaptation and on illness-related quality of life.	1.1433400638808662
Postoperative sports activity during regional chemotherapy is possible.	0.7515445894305172
Introduction: We report our experience with laparoscopic nephrectomy in comparison to open nephrectomy in geriatric patients.	1.1819053786350204
The laparoscopic technique is presented and the results are discussed with respect to the data from the current literature.	1.3181867312744615
Material and Methods: Since 1993, a total of 249 patient have undergone a nephrectomy for benign renal disease.	1.092202828701319
In 131 patients a laparoscopic nephrectomy (in most cases via a transperitoneal approach) was performed and in 118 patients an open nephrectomy via a flank incision.	1.1601064611768477
Clinical parameters were compared between both groups as well as with respect to different age groups.	0.9150897462591024
Results: There were no differences in terms of operative results (operative time, pre- and postoperative hemoglobin) between the laparoscopy group and open nephrectomy group as well as among the different age groups.	1.1496948000125853
Patients in the laparoscopy group demonstrated significant advantages with respect to blood loss, transfusion rate, analgesic consumption, hospital stay, and convalescence.	1.0420411569614583
These advantages were not related to patient age.	0.7444341934126103
The complication rate was comparable for both groups; however, both groups showed an elevation of the complication rate in the age groups 75 to 84 years.	1.1736512526066287
The mortality rate within the first 30 days after nephrectomy was 1.7% in the open nephrectomy group.	1.2348646225499433
Conclusions: The laparoscopic nephrectomy offers comparable operative results (with less blood loss and a lower transfusion rate) when compared to open nephrectomy.	1.1663966268540087
In terms of postoperative parameters, patients in the laparoscopy group have significant advantages.	1.0698566064994022
Especially geriatric patients benefit from these advantages and, therefore, the laparoscopic approach should be the preferred technique for a nephrectomy in these patients.	1.0324714266703379
The vast majority of adder bites among children in Germany is caused by the common viper (vipera berus).	0.9270538360539021
The venom that is applicated by the viper contains several enzymes, some of them with hemorrhagic and neurotoxic activity.	0.9236808799808277
Adder bites among children may be without any symtoms but as well may cause severe intoxication.	0.8832526762368543
The aim of this study was to evaluate the results after open Bankart repair using suture anchors in patients with recurrent posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability.	0.8851981999098192
Some 32 patients were prospectively observed for a mean of 40 months (24-60) after stabilization.	1.2467179875659828
The mean age at the time of operation was 29.7 years.	1.0063818048958233
All patients were postoperatively immobilized in a sling for 3 weeks.	1.0192520974464225
According to the criteria of Rowe, 29 patients (90.6 %) had good or excellent results.	1.0736905359605051
Two patients (6.3 %) developed recurrent instability 6-24 months postoperatively; 93.7 % were not or only slights limited in sports activities.	1.213164857680615
Bankart repair is an excellent treatment for recurrent posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability.	0.8254334821063126
The use of suture anchors is an appropriate way of reattaching the capsuloligamentous complex to the glenoid to restore stability to an unstable joint.	0.9655293769296622
Purpose: Assessment of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) patency with computed tomography methods has been demonstrated as an alternative to coronary angiography.	1.181575303303199
The evaluation of the bypass anastomoses is still of limited success.	0.8607019095956594
Prospective ECG triggering of conventional CT scanners al- lows heart phase-triggered single-slice acquisition in the sub-second range.	0.8706485888481473
The goal of this study was to evaluate whether the use of ECG triggering can optimize the evaluation of proximal CABG anastomoses.	1.0113878124279376
Multiple personality is known since last century und has been described by Breuer and Freud as well as by Kraepelin.	1.0450405722075138
In the latest and nearly exclusively angloamerican literature multiple personality disorder is included in the dissociated reactions in borderline personality disorder.	0.8450111515421749
The concept of comorbidity is criticized.	0.575941241079388
Case studies illustrate indications for diagnosing MPD.	0.6667253244323721
The authors point out, that sufficient diagnostic methods and criteria are still not existing.	1.1637687336696514
But their development has its limits: In most cases a history of sexual abuse can be detected and therefore an intensive diagnostic "investigation" can be on a psychodynamic level a repetition of traumatic abuse.	1.0898327552156364
Many new methods have been introduced in reproductive medicine in recent years, and some have already found their way into clinical routine.	1.0147097780618572
Cryopreservation of oocytes and in vitro maturation and culture of primordial follicles do not play a significant role in patient treatment.	0.9974159627568429
However, the short-term culture of oocytes before metaphase II does seem relevant.	0.967751757622677
Blastocyst culture has mostly replaced coculture techniques and, given appropriate laws, provides adequate possibility of selecting embryos with high developmental and implantation potential.	0.9403870689386666
An exact pronuclear diagnosis also has a high ability to predict the probability of implantation.	0.8943282450435339
Viewing the latest data, assisted hatching seems to bring no improvements for most patients.	0.8150373820039534
Preimplantation diagnosis is being discussed in Germany due to new statements from ethical committees.	0.9221598602896007
Cytoplasma transfer, nuclear transfer, or the transplantation of spermatogenic cells into donors are currently only experimental.	1.0013424827912352
The importance of spiral-CT is clinically accepted for diagnosing spreading disease and for making a decision about the therapy strategy for head and neck tumors.	0.4911276634169387
Its importance for follow-up after radiotherapy was examined in 26 patients with irradiated laryngeal tumors.	0.5413971412368318
Using spiral-CT multiple signs of alterations (n = 98) can be diagnosed, which are not only important for tumour relapse, but also for assessment.	0.980227795686659
Spiral-CT offers the possibility of achieviny various additional information about the larynx that cannot be obtained with laryngoscopy.	0.4802409930616585
In follow-up examinations after radiation, laryngoscopy and spiral-CT are recommended as an integrated neck examination using the breath-holding technique (separately reconstructed) and also as functional spiral-CT of the vocal cords in "I"-phonation.	0.6227970554241586
In the years 1980-1992 surveys were undertaken to ascertain the occurrence of central nervous system infections in children in pediatric departments in the German provinces of Bavaria and Lower Saxony.	1.0859476621383874
There was a very noticeable drop in viral meningitides over the survey years especially in mumps meningitis, i. e. from 199/205 in 1980 to 16/7 in 1992.	0.9318551451203398
In both states about 80 % of the viral meningitides could not be clarified etiologically.	1.118412761100411
Whereas in Bavaria a steady increase in herpes simplex encephalitides and varizella zoster encephalitides was apparent (1/4 in 1980, 10/24 in 1992), the same development was not found in Lower Saxony.	1.1736222471146955
Although the number of measles encephalitides dropped in both states during the period of the survey, up to 6 cases of the illness occurred annually.	1.1058646773024503
Only in the case of herpes simplex encephalitis the rate of recovery shows a substantial improvement over the observation period, while for other forms the rate of partial recovery has remained approximately the same.	1.1078518163912188
Purpose: To assess patient reliability and compliance, most perimeters check for false-positive and -negative answers.	1.2259842981264317
In this study the results of catch trials were obtained with video campimetry with respect to age-related changes and differences for tests using increment and decrement stimuli.	1.1275010372183325
During a 7-year period (between July 1987 and June 1994) 19 patients were treated for Chopart dislocation.	1.0126236502300807
Seventeen patients were examined clinically 48 months following trauma.	1.1451746268203415
We found 1 excellent, 6 good, 6 mediocre, and 4 poor results.	1.2385402367940872
Only 4 patients were able to achieve their pre-accident level of work and no patients could return to sports at the same level.	1.0303686043529927
In our patients, Chopart dislocation had a negative social consequence both at the work place and in recreational activities.	0.975686109184419
In long-term follow-up, the Chopart dislocation was the most debilitating injury even for polytrauma patients.	0.9633125957423971
For incidents of malignant hyperthermia (MH) outside the hospital, a high number of unrecorded cases must be reckoned with because of an insufficient knowledge of emergency services and poor identification and documentation that make it impossible to classify acute situations under the diagnosis of malignant hyperthermia crisis.	1.0435704370640209
As a result, there are no statistical data in this field, and only case reports with a broad spectrum of suspected trigger mechanisms have been published.	1.1915982418205675
The case described in this report is a proved example of a non-anesthesia-related triggering of MH in a 21-year-old man who had had an anesthetic-induced MH manifestation in childhood, which was confirmed with an in vitro contracture test.	1.1519429928839342
After visiting a restaurant, he became unconscious and convulsive after consuming a high level of alcohol (2.9permil).	0.9971668865470118
The first cardiocirculatory arrest occurred directly before hospitalization.	0.6428867178588563
After admission, the patient showed a full-blown MH episode whose subsequent fatality was unavoidable in spite of adapted and optimal therapy.	1.0920729397833582
Suspected trigger mechanisms seem to be multifactoral (excessive alcohol consumption, over-heating, mental stress) as a forensic investigation did not point to any particular signs of typical trigger substances.	1.0336387498295307
The case demonstrates again that an MH attack might be triggered under certain non-anaesthesia-related situations.	0.8656440275564279
For patients with an MH disposition, additional information on their behavior outside the hospital is required.	1.1567938587512425
Dipterous fly maggots of different species live worldwide as parasites in hoofed mammals.	0.6801473026446441
In the host the larval development causes typical boils, i. e., abscesses including the larvae.	0.8955851136479468
As a result of increasing tourist traffic, travelers can also bring back to Germany tropical types of myiasis.	0.8524667241043428
Surgical treatment of diffuse peritonitis is applied very variably.	0.8392555922403725
There is no question that source control is the most important treatment principle, but the role of additional treatment concepts such as continuous postoperative peritoneal lavage remains controversial.	1.2311352206074562
In a prospective survey (1993-1996) we analyzed the need for additional treatment concepts in our patient material.	1.2798323994459861
In 186 patients with diffuse peritonitis we applied the concept of source control and extensive (20-30 l) intraoperative lavage.	1.0513506975965183
Additional treatment principles such as continuous postoperative peritoneal lavage (n = 17) or staged lavage (n = 5) were applied only "on demand", namely in 20 patients (11 %).	1.1487963659773113
In 166 patients (89 %) source control of diffuse peritonitis was possible.	1.0731963906069184
The mean severity of peritonitis (n = 186) was 28.5 (range 16-43) using the Mannheim Peritonitis Index.	1.4035794386025602
The primary cause of peritonitis in our patients was perforation or leakage in the lower GI tract (52 %).	1.0013171843014892
The hospital mortality rate was 12 % in the whole group, and the postoperative morbidity rate was 34 %.	1.5221538280833848
We conclude that nowadays, using high-quality intensive care as well as modern antiinfective treatment, only a few patients (ca.	1.3386713600317
10 %) need additional therapy measures such as postoperative lavage.	0.956612945417349
Surgical source control in combination with intraoperative lavage is sufficient in most of the patients with diffuse peritonitis.	1.1623461489929936
Native Tissue Harmonic Imaging is a new way of ultrasound image processing that addresses the difficult-to-image patient.	0.9778296277432547
By using a Gaussian shaped transmit pulse it is possible to separate from the returning echo the harmonic component without overlapping with fundamental reflections.	0.9117628298522824
The improved image quality leads to higher diagnostic confidence so that the use of further imaging modalitites is unnecessary.	0.8682338485724079
Aim: The aim of this study was to validate the detection of calcified arteriosclerotic plaques with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS).	0.8680898842539825
Method: 181 arteries were examined by 20/30 MHz IVUS.	1.0309984457956625
The ultrasound cross-sections were compared to the corresponding radiologic (30 kV) and histologic cross-sections.	1.1858473429076155
Results: Calcified lesions were imaged as bright echos with shadowing.	0.8637494876878987
In 13 cases of 161 calcified lesions were too small to detect by IVUS.	0.9071050831678137
In 5 ultrasonic sections the diagnosis "calcified lesion" could not be verified neither by radiology nor by histology.	0.8392680528191387
The sensitivity was 91.6%, the specificity was 94.7% and the accuracy was 93.0%.	1.3018233540073856
Conclusions: Because of the acoustic properties of calcium, calcified lesions can be detected accurately by IVUS.	0.9241565990178955
IVUS can generate new insights into the effect of plaque composition on the response to catheter therapies.	0.7942498130969358
Hillel Klein has called the holocaust "the dark core of the twentieth century".	0.8433842659787154
It was the aim of weekly conferences, held in Israel in 1994 and 1996, to explore its repercussions on current behaviour.	1.0527962053667304
The topic was "The past in the present".	1.2240093231652034
The participants were Israelis and Germans, the staff international.	0.8795956472964531
The method used was the application of the "group relations conference", specially devised for these conferences.	1.0380951065771828
The leadership was in the hands of Eric J. Miller, director of the group relations program at the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations in London, where this group method originated and continues to be particularly cultivated still today.	0.9922614351762212
It is especially suited when an unconscious conflict between subgroups exists that emerges on the surface in forms which lead to confusion and misunderstandings.	0.9045486935354522
The task which had been put to the participants was as follows: to explore how feelings and fantasies influence relations within and between the two groups.	0.9745479420031393
This was easy to remember but not always easy to adhere to.	0.8335682984886552
There were moments when fantasy and reality got confused, accompanied by intense feelings.	0.7010109930083255
In this paper my experience with a databank for cases with bone diseases is reported.	1.086004286959437
All cases which had been diagnosed in the newly formed Department of Bone Pathology of the University of Hamburg since 1970 were registered in uniform fashion.	1.0418253518302814
Adapting the system to state-of-the-art network structures required a lot of personal and financial investment.	0.8792860332421536
This could not be accomplished by university resources alone, but only in cooperation with other research funds.	1.0442545632270956
Now 76 000 cases can be routinely accessed and scientifically analysed.	0.680993383970347
Background and purpose: In Germany, 750,000 children are born per year who should be screened for developmental visual defects in the age range 24-48 months.	1.0203286791579125
However, the established pediatric screening program is not sufficient to prevent amblyopia.	1.1211913204234858
The purpose of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of alternatives for amblyopia and microtropia screening.	0.8268259836238367
The fluorescence diagnosis based on the aminolavulinic acid-stimulated porphyrin synthesis allows the detection of superficial tumors in a very early stage even when they are very small tumors.	1.000438674311496
A fluorescence diagnosis of tumors in the oral cavity can be simply performed by rinsing with a 0.4% ALA solution for 20 min.	0.9620629102478844
This topical application avoids systemic side effects such as skin sensitization.	0.6803064348508109
The red fluorescent areas are visible to the naked eye; only a blue light source for fluorescence excitation is necessary and a suitable red filter for observation.	0.9639890815201417
In our study on 56 patients suffering from carcinoma of the oral cavity, 96% of the histologically confirmed carcinoma could be visualized via fluorescence.	1.1142270337547366
In 3 patients additional tumors were detected via fluorescence that were not visible otherwise.	0.9570459584461567
However, many patients show fluorescent areas with no correlation to the histological finding.	1.307604120258075
It was verified that bacteria from the oral cavity also produce PpIX after ALA incubation, which leads to false-positive findings.	1.0183744366044312
Reduction of the false-positive findings was achieved by rinsing the oral cavity with hydrogen peroxide and by mechanical plaque reduction.	1.0404363887840422
This improves the reliability of a fluorescence-guided biopsy.	0.8352976098124256
However, suppression of the bacteria fluorescence is necessary for clinical use of this diagnostic method.	1.3977123245107719
Autocapture is a newly developed automatic threshold tracking algorithm implemented in implantable pacemakers.	0.8042808753625001
Based on the detection of the cardiac evoked response, autocapture continuously controls the effectiveness of stimulation.	1.0236675444395253
Increases in threshold are immediately followed by an adaption of the pulse amplitude.	0.8075104928461132
Automatic threshold tests periodically lower the amplitude in order to adapt to decreased thresholds.	0.7800892183273124
Thus, changes in threshold can be monitored over a long period and utilized as a diagnostic tool.	1.1795484830602436
This case report demonstrates the diagnosis and monitoring of a microdislodgement by means of autocapture.	1.0533735737432937
The indication to treat symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is discussed controversely.	0.8785381819082883
Successful medical treatment may result in the reduction of symptoms by improving hemodynamics in a reduction of thromboembolic events.	0.9452691087420593
However, several antiarrhythmic drugs are also known to increase the risk of proarrhythmic events.	1.274557261882109
Tissue engineering offers the possibility to fabricate living substitutes for tissues and organs by combining histogenic cells and biocompatible carrier materials.	0.8770586061530341
Pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells are isolated and subcultured ex vivo and then their histogenic differentiation is induced by external factors.	0.8585625693342526
The fabrication of bone and cartilage constructs, their combinations and gene therapeutic approaches are demonstrated.	1.0622989247085983
Advantages and disadvantages of these methods are described by in vitro and in vitro testing.	1.1006551944595147
The proof of histotypical function after implantation in vivo is essential.	0.8465965659332971
The use of autologous cells and tissue engineering methods offers the possibility to overcome the disadvantages of classical tissue reconstruction - donor site morbidity of autologous grafts, immunogenicity of allogenic grafts and loosening of alloplastic implants.	1.0246995690473575
Furthermore, tissue engineering widens the spectrum of surgical indications in bone and cartilage reconstruction.	1.2483082015211935
The purpose of this paper is to present principle and technique of proximal lateral column lengthening by calcaneal osteotomy and to critically analyze our preliminary results.	0.9485946227653728
16 patients (7 female, 9 male; average age 52.3 years [24-72 years]) were treated for stage II to III posterior tibial tendon insufficiency by calcaneal osteotomy and medial soft tissue reconstruction (tendon reconstruction, 15; tendon transfer, 8; deltoid ligament repair, 10).	1.168308775083826
When the AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot Rating Scale was applied, these patients were shown to have significantly increased their scores from an average preoperative value of 49.1 to a mean postoperative value of 91.1 after a mean follow-up of 24.6 months.	1.2036392706223813
In all but one case no loss of achieved foot correction was noted.	0.7663669700673437
In one case, a fusion of the calcaneocuboid joint had to be performed after 5 months due to painful degenerative joint disease.	1.067142547406541
At follow-up, all patients had satisfactory restoration of their medial longitudinal arch, reduction of forefoot abduction, and restored arch height.	1.1078383315983982
All patients were able to fully weight-bear the operated foot, and all patients were satisfied with the achieved result.	0.9741300176016922
In the pes planovalgus deformity occurring in stage II to III (as significant degenerative joint disease has not already occurred), osteotomies appear to have a significant role in the operative management and to function by restoring more normal biomechanics, thus allowing tendon reconstruction and tendon transfers to return to successfull function.	1.140576224763186
By the update of §24 a of the German road traffic act driving under the influence of drugs of abuse can now be fined even in absence of an actual driving impairment.	0.9589705765975567
The only requisite is the detection of certain drugs/metabolites in a blood sample.	0.9490593470336681
Therefore for pretesting there is a need for fast and reliable immunological screening methods in blood/serum.	0.8782614594327547
The new Mahsan microtiterplate enzyme immunoassay (MTP-EIA) is claimed to be sensitive and independent of the matrix.	0.9414296676469461
For an evaluation we carried out a comparison of the cannabinoid and opiate assays from Mahsan (MTP-EIA) and the routinely used Abbott fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) with a batch of routine serum samples.	1.0725956413467765
For the MTP-EIAs we used the cut-off recommendations of the supplier (cannabinoids 2 ng/mL, opiates 10 ng/mL).	0.8358061726771849
For the Abbott FPIAs the serum samples had to be pretreated (deproteinization with acetone) and appropriate cut-offs were defined by our investigations (cannabinoids 20 ng/mL, opiates 30 ng/mL).	0.9519396620535497
Out of 136 samples screened for cannabinoids 42% were positive with GC-MS and 18% from 123 samples were positive for opiates.	1.0906853434801225
The Abbott cannabinoid FPIA gave false negative results in 23% of GC-MS positive cases and 9% false negatives for opiates while Mahsan MTP-EIA gave no false negatives.	1.0393116452001965
Each of the two cannabinoid assays gave false positive results in 13% of the cases and for the MTP opiate assay 2% of the positives could not be confirmed with GC-MS. As a result of our study the cut-off values for the MTP-EIAs have proved to be suitable for a distinction between potential positives and true negatives.	1.245314874972068
Systemic karyomegaly associated with interstitial nephritis was first described in 1978 by Mihatsch.	0.778279067640133
Seven cases have been reported to date.	0.9403265152312426
We give an account of an autopsy case of systemic karyomegaly in a 30-year-old Italian man.	1.0082878988553048
Bizarre enlargement of nuclei was found in renal tubular epithelial cells, Schwann cells and in smooth muscle cells of vessels and bowel and, less obviously, in endothelial and adventitial cells of vessels, in alveolar epithelial cells and in astrocytes of the brain.	1.1323348844837537
These findings were associated with chronic interstitial nephritis, nonspecific hepatopathy, adenocarcinoma of the rectum and multiple slerosis.	1.1007136045027528
The clinical course was marked by chronic renal failure, chronic haemodialysis and renal transplantation.	1.0983341814896417
The patient died 8 years after diagnosis in septic-toxic shock.	1.1540230727947958
The aetiology and pathogenesis of the disease are discussed.	1.0028474892724617
17% of malignant melanomas (n=100) investigated in a dermatologic practice were less than 6 mm in maximal diameter (median diameter: 4.0 +/- 0.9 mm).	1.2273500692218728
The median age of the 17 patients at diagnosis of small-diameter melanomas was 42 years.	1.1200723759504472
The essential epiluminescence microscopic and histopatologic features of these small melanomas resembled those of larger lesions, although their clinical criteria differed from the classic ABCDs.	1.0229337464326895
6 (35,3%) of the small melanomas were were found to be in situ.	1.5248361195305604
This percentage was nearly similar to those in situ lesions within the group of melanomas of 6 mm in diameter or larger (38,3%).	0.9803013938351759
The remaining 11 small lesions were classified as invasive from Clark's level I to V, including all classic histogenetic types (superficial spreading, nodular, unclassified, desmoplastic).	0.9208416620226121
The median thickness of the small invasive melanomas was 0,76 +/- 0,23 mm.	1.1020759999660552
7 small melanomas had apparent histologic remnants of a melanocytic nevus.	0.7174710420729461
Epiluminescence microscopic features of the melanomas were evaluated and statistically compared with those of 100 dysplastic nevi and 50 spindle cell nevi.	0.8883596694027867
The technique of epiluminescence microscopy allowed the identification of such malignant melanomas that could not be discerned by the naked eye or by a pocket-lens.	0.8551549806386475
Mycobacterium gordonae is an atypical mycobacterium of very low pathogenic potential.	0.7897303074138112
It is widely distributed in soil and water and often detected on the mucous membranes of healthy persons.	0.8365010018224837
In recent years, there have been numerous reports of infections by M. gordonae in immunocompromised patients.	0.9653463387258758
In contrast, only four cases of skin infections by M. gordonae in immunocompetent patients have been published.	1.0956946610803489
We report on another patient without evidence of immunodeficiency who developed an atypical mycobacteriosis after a thorn injury during gardening.	1.0652804815187882
M. gordonae was isolated by tissue culture.	0.8418811606564779
The skin lesion cleared completely after treatment with doxycycline for three months.	0.7873339176228602
The article gives a review on oncocytic metaplasia and oncocytic tumors.	0.7241665195065146
Biochemical, cytochemical and molecular genetic findings are discussed.	0.8484095602310137
It has been established, that defects of the respiratory chain occur predominantly in oncocytic foci of the parathyroids and the liver.	1.186915428292263
The underlying molecular genetic mechanisms are still unclear, however.	1.0234407840154394
In particular, one has to assume that oncocytic metaplasia differs pathogenetically from oncocytic neoplasia.	0.9488806641431211
Furthermore, organ-dependent prognostic differences of oncocytic tumors exist.	1.2137337324769197
Oncocytic carcinomas are predominantly seen in the thyroid and are scarce in other organs.	1.01555917898079
The molecular genetic basis of this phenomenon is, however, still unknown.	1.2660016205079452
The authors describe the feasibility of developing receptor-specific MR contrast agents for the improved detection of pathology and assessment of organ function.	0.8281380538734494
Receptor specificity of MR contrast agents can be achieved by binding of receptor-specific carriers to ligands.	0.9575667574005474
This concept leads towards a decrease in dose and thus in toxicity.	0.8509610715964411
Specific attachment to parenchymal cells improves tumor-organ contrast and therefore tumor detection.	0.8028559534577036
Specific uptake mechanisms also enable the assessment of organ function.	0.6494504230676451
Future design concepts of novel MR contrast agents may consider the desired uptake in specific cells or organs (ovaries, adrenal glands, lymph nodes etc.)	0.8615312091699483
with subsequent synthesis of appropriate carriers.	0.6364458163321475
Elastosis perforans serpiginosa can arise as a rare complication in patients with Down syndrome.	0.9263703027615164
It is one of the primary perforating disorders characterized by transepithelial elimination of abnormal elastic fibers.	0.9023643997976315
This may reflect an immunological reaction aquist elastic fibers.	0.5936948050991167
We describe a 40-year-old woman with Down's syndrome whose skin lesions were histologically mistaken for lupus vulgaris for a long time.	0.9616700871702739
The position of the talus and the os calcaneum has consequences for the architecture of the forefoot.	0.9925675444677774
Medial tilting of the talus with vertical position provokes flattening of the medial arch and abduction of the forefoot.	0.9973483173055125
Varus position of the calcis and lateral direction of the talus (as in residual clubfoot), however, causes supination and adduction of the forefoot.	1.2595156213647722
Repair of deformities in the hindfoot therefore also influences the forefoot.	0.7542988841703462
A large number of various osteotomies have been proposed at both bones.	0.8285077142126356
The most popular ones are Dwyer's osteotomy at the corpus of the calcis and its modification described by Mitchell at the same location for correction of the cavus foot and the residual clubfoot, and the lengthening osteotomy at the neck of the calcaneum according to Evans.	1.0302415577832467
Indication and operative technique of these three procedures are described in detail.	1.0443782509693806
The closing wedge osteotomy according to Dwyer is indicated in cases of cavus feet.	0.7160842843938403
In clubfeet the os calcis is usually too short and the medial opening wedge osteotomy provokes skin problems.	0.8572419162676101
In these cases an osteotomy according to Mitchell with lateral displacement of the tuber calcanei is more suitable.	0.8698431850325388
In flat- and skewfeet a lengthening osteotomy at the neck of the calcaneum according to Evans can be indicated, especially when the load of the foot is bigger medially under the talus rather than at the lateral margin of the foot.	1.0155319755099586
If these procedures are carried out carefully, they have low complications rates.	1.018949076096687
Between January 1994 and August 1998, 12 patients with 13 chronic infections after resection arthroplasty were treated successfully with vastus lateralis muscleflap.	0.9031360046346548
One patient was suffering from chronic infection on both sides.	0.8826101397454952
In all cases we found the infected cavity to be the origin of the persistent infection.	1.2926653496079783
The average duration of infection was 8.3 months.	1.121357491240593
The patients had undergone an average of 3.8 operations.	1.2719835322649762
Up to now there was no recurrent infection, controlled by clinical investigation, ultrasound and laboratory findings in all 13 cases.	1.2199594320030034
Follow up investigation occured 2.5 years (1.5-4.7) after flap transfer.	1.2237093099215357
The flap is easy to harvest.	0.5776392978010766
He has a very constant pattern of vascular pedicle and a wide arc of rotation.	0.9019731732604583
The functional deficits of donor side morbidity are minimal.	0.7708962211269762
That vastus lateralis flap seems to be an ideal procedure to stop draining infections due to infected cavities in the hip region.	0.9063793325812782
Information technologies have been integrated in gynecological oncology treatment and, therefore, new software has been established in hospitals and private clinics.	1.099147745349178
A German law for hospital tumor registration has attempted to unify the different strategies.	0.7942098464053651
All intentions to establish new documentation systems for tumor diseases need a standardized basic data set.	0.831722819361529
Nevertheless, local governmental health organizations are not yet prepared to implement a global information system such as prenatal and perinatal care databases.	1.1046496479049355
Financial support and political work is therefore needed.	0.7588161941206518
To optimise the microsurgical training in our clinic we organized a permanent possibility to practice microsurgical techniques of vascular anastomosis.	0.9458638610955499
This includes stepwise education by means of plastic materials, human placenta and the rat model.	0.8493182606092095
The most important role in this concept is played by the placenta.	1.2388660421305817
It supplies a realistic simulation of different in vivo situations concerning microvascular anastomosis.	0.7709615294145377
As to availability, handling and costs the placenta is superior to animal models and has replaced them almost completely in our educational concept.	0.8853404038611493
Since Manfred Bleuler's description of the clinical picture of late onset schizophrenia over 50 years ago, debate has persisted as to whether it is justifiable to differentiate this as a valid, independent entity from the group of classic schizophrenic disorders with early onset.	1.0645520835743096
As this review shows, this question cannot be answered unequivocally even now.	0.9936588597942595
It must rather be remarked that we have neither been able to decisively extend our knowledge since Manfred Bleuler's comprehensive contribution, nor managed to achieve a much sounder basis methodologically.	0.9189129173572524
The reasons for this are the international conceptual and terminological confusion that has developed around this illness group, and on the other hand the methodological limitations of the empirical studies conducted on this clinical picture so far.	1.0926382131271812
Definition of the problem: In parallel with public and philosophical discussions, there is an ongoing debate about euthanasia in theological ethics.	1.0014691839442567
In this situation it is helpful to provide a systematic overview of the different arguments and judgements.	1.1555959502223567
Arguments: A short introduction is followed by a first part dealing with the definition of terms.	1.216826715539489
The second and major part concerning normative arguments is subdivided into three steps: the level of principles, the more concrete level of actions and finally the level of social consequences.	1.1176326663177145
The third part presents some reflections following the eudaimonistic ethical tradition (the ethics of a good life and death) focusing on the central question: how to find meaning in life when faced with suffering.	1.0218460906817632
Conclusion: It would be fruitful to intensify the ethical reflection both on the problems concerning the foundations of social life, especially the meaning of dignity, autonomy and inviolability of human life, and social consequences of a liberal practice of euthanasia.	1.1168002583309458
In this context ethicists are challenged to reflect on the different approaches to what is or can be a good life and a human death.	1.0415616942952577
Multimodal therapy of oral squamous cell carcinomas today is based on surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.	1.0362474027077058
Despite the combination of all three therapeutic options, there is still a large number of treatment failures and therefore major questions remain.	1.063573811935642
Recent investigations suggest that mutations of the p53 tumor supressor gene may account for some of the therapeutic failures.	0.930790432532176
Inactivation of the gene may be an  important determinant of the efficiacy of today's multimodal therapy protocols.	0.927802555271095
In 90 patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity biopsy specimens were taken before and after preoperative radiochemotherapy.	0.9185884656419329
From all patients, biopsy and resection material was available for immunohistochemical analysis of p53.	0.8719991940639352
After radiation treatment, 51 patients (57%) showed a complete response; 39 patients (43%) only showed a partial response or did not respond at all.	1.3214413369971085
Among the responders, 82% of the pretherapeutic tumors were p53 positive, whereas among the nonresponders only 56% of the pretherapeutic tumors were p53 positive.	1.0555737807791261
The majority of the residual tumors were also p53 negative according to immunohistology after radiation treatment.	1.0248766875373039
In our study, detection of p53 protein by immunohistochemistry seemed to be connected with a more radiosensitive reaction of the tumors.	0.9894527342532545
Nevertheless, successful strategies for radiation therapy may need to take into account the tissue of origin and the status of p53 in the tumor.	1.2541070095104532
The human cartilage and bone is characterized by a remodeling during the life, well balanced by neosynthesis and degradation of matrix components.	0.9770211967785295
In different joint diseases, it becomes imbalanced and the destruction of the cartilage supersedes the repair.	1.0101852254373096
In tissue processes in disease and in normal turnover of the matrix, these molecules are fragmented and released into surrounding fluids, in the synovial fluid, and then in the blood and the urin, where they can be detected.	1.2749989776751887
The quantitative measurement in the synovial fluid is more specific than in the other body fluids.	1.06964888774721
The research process in recent years has suggested that these molecular markers of cartilage and bone matrix metabolism can be used to determine diagnosis, the disease severity rather than its presence or absence, the prognosis, and the response to therapy.	1.343780286029484
They should help to identify the disease mechanism in different joint diseases not only on the tissue but also on the molecular level.	1.0625191098698406
The specific cartilage matrix markers promise to become useful tools in the future in clinical use.	1.0010928834620696
The research in this area is still in the early stages, with most results dated from the end of the 1980s and the 1990s.	1.2407906512327036
Axillary block is a common anaesthetic technique for operations on the hand and forearm.	1.0390440636904998
In our hospital, with many trainees in anaesthesia, only 250 - 300 axillary blocks per year are performed by about 30 colleagues.	1.2197585284477288
This implies a small number of blocks for each anaesthetist.	0.8338875122867123
The present study was designed to assess whether it is possible to teach this technique and use it with an adequate degree of success under these conditions.	1.1712303447744434
We used a nerve stimulator and studied whether the success of the block under these conditions is independent of anaesthetist's experience in this technique.	0.9612326130688617
Furthermore, we examined other factors involved in the success of the block.	1.2719906184752137
The study included 112 patients subjected to elective surgery of the upper extremity; all received an axillary block.	1.0197744190975995
We used a nerve stimulator and injected mepivacaine 1% without adrenaline.	0.9122809630256852
The following parameters were recorded: the number of blocks to date performed by the anaesthetist; the minimal current required for nerve stimulation; the dose of local anaesthetic; the time between the end of injection and the beginning of surgery; the duration of surgery; and the quality of sensory and motor blockade after 10, 20, and 30 min.	1.2854178814551545
Sensory blockade was assessed by the pinprick method (no blockade, analgesia, anaesthesia); motor blockade was judged by comparing the muscle strength of both arms (no blockade, paresis, paralysis).	0.9953207285035732
Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test, with P<0.05 considered statistically significant.	1.095401827430496
Of the 112 blocks, 95 (85%) were successful; 17 (15%) failed and the patients required general anaesthesia.	1.217540662486708
Eight of the successful blocks showed a decrease in analgesic quality after >=70 min and required additional analgesics or general anaesthesia.	0.9316267647136595
We found no correlation between the experience of the anaesthetist and the success of the block.	0.9039947255139802
The minimal required current for nerve stimulation in the success group was 0.4 mA and differed significantly from the value of 0.6 mA in the failure group (Table 3).	1.0672407541664999
The dose of mepivacaine was higher in the success group (5.9 vs. 5.3 mg/kg).	1.196672108016593
Complete sensory blockade was more frequently achieved for the median, ulnar, and radial nerves than for the musculocutaneous and cutaneous brachii medialis (Fig.	0.9651318899102704
The frequency of complete sensory blockade (anaesthesia) had increased by 21.9% between the 20th and 30th min.	1.1023922478254984
Complete motor blockade was less often achieved than sensory blockade (Fig.	0.724709334847125
Using the method of electrostimulation, the axillary block is an appropriate anaesthetic technique that can be applied in a hospital where each anaesthetist only occasionally performs it.	1.237550015699288
Prior to injection of the local anaesthetic, the current for nerve stimulation should be reduced to <0.5 mA.	1.3350549855134952
The time between the end of injection and the beginning of surgery should be no less than 30 min because complete sensory blockade can more often be achieved.	0.8887735353186769
The dose of mepivacaine should be no less than 6 mg/kg body weight.	0.948024149204153
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was discovered 10 years ago as a growth factor that can regulate angiogenesis and in addition the permeability of blood vessels.	1.0681020396748704
Numerous studies have revealed that it is essential for normal embryonic development and that it plays a major role in physiological and pathological events of angiogenesis in adults.	1.0889175772972828
It is unique in that its expression is regulated directly by hypoxia.	0.7575837504551829
These properties are now being exploited in attempts aimed at the induction of new blood vessels in pathological situations such as ischemic heart disease.	0.8629383375258817
Five VEGF forms of 121 to 206 amino-acids are produced from a single gene by alternative splicing.	0.8541730058539272
Cells expressing VEGF usually express several forms simultaneously.	0.6221927380323239
VEGF121 does not contain exons 6 and 7 of the gene and consequently lacks a heparin binding ability.	0.9348554635249017
However, this form is fully  active as an inducer of angiogenesis, and as a blood vessel permeabilizing agent.	1.2858368031250154
Exon 6 and 7 contain 2 independent heparin binding domains.	0.7755796399905925
The VEGF form containing exon 7 (VEGF165) and the vascular endothelial growth factor form containing exon 6 (VEGF145) display similar biological potencies raising the question of why so many VEGF forms are required.	1.1155358135777647
It was found that VEGF121 diffuses better because it does not bind to heparan-sulfate proteoglycans.	0.774762664542703
In contrast, VEGF145 binds to extracellular matrix ad is released from it slowly.	0.8191316561090849
When the receptor binding properties of VEGF121 and VEGF165 were compared it was found that VEGF165 binds to a class of VEGF receptors that is not recognized by VEGF121.	0.9390152123890463
These receptors are encoded by the neuropilin-1 gene, and we have recently found that the related neuropilin-2 gene also encodes a VEGF165 receptor.	1.0103569431629884
We have recently found evidence indicating the neuropilins form complexes with another VEGF receptor, VEGFR-1.	0.7574812867683856
However, the biological function of this complex remains to be elucidated.	1.0848322824393521
In addition to mucositis and myelotoxicity as well known early reactions after radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy in advanced head and neck tumors, late toxicity following treatment is an often underestimated problem.	1.0851796990704539
The healing of wounds by secondary  intention is a simple method to close  operative defects.	1.068348237822144
The quality of wound healing will depend on the anatomic site on the face as well as on size and depth of the  defect.	1.1753684472681445
Best functional and cosmetic results are obtained at locations with concave  geometry and when the defect lies  symmetrically at the interface of two  anatomic subunits.	0.9916599025221656
Partial reconstruction or guiding sutures can create a symmetric  defect in relation to anatomic subunits which will heal by second intention.	0.8109418270716696
This simple and efficient operative procedure is ilustrated by two case reports.	0.8246410588564221
Background: Acute infectious mononucleosis (IM) is a selflimiting lymphoproliferative disease of EBV-infected (immortalised) B cells and poly-/oligoclonal cytotoxic T cells which are to a high percentage EBV-specific.	1.2349749451003056
In B cells EBV infection mainly leads to a latent infection with expression of EBV nuclear antigens 1-6 (EBNA1-6) and membrane antigens 1, 2A and 2B (LMP1, LMP2A and LMP2B).	0.9674267388535186
Expression of these EBV latent antigens leads to transformation and immortalisation of infected B cells.	0.726525578364845
Here we examined if also lytic EBV genes (i.e.	0.5815570924915642
BZLF1), which are associated with a productive EBV infection, are expressed during IM.	1.3046667986372609
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVCM) is a frequent underlying disease in young patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and sudden death.	1.0582044097198666
Treatment is frequently indicated and is mainly directed at the prevention of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death.	0.8835488040885957
In a minority of patients with progressive ARVCM and clinical signs of heart failure, pharmacological treatment with vasodilators, diuretics, and digitalis may be required.	1.0119038403229121
A prospective study was performed to compare the sensitivity and accuracy of ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) as a bone scan to detect subclinical invasion of the mandible by squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and floor of mouth.	1.2149125588705425
The typical clinical features of myasthenia gravis are weakness and excessive fatiguability of striated muscles that increases during the course of the day or after strenous exercise.	0.9775504218741945
Ocular muscle involvement with ptosis (in 50%) and diplopia (in 25%) are the most common initial signs.	1.3389768754130558
The disease can progress to bulbar muscles and to all other striated muscles (generalized myasthenia).	0.8692521176398456
The muscle fatiguability and a fluctuating course can mislead to a diagnosis of neurasthenia.	0.8188481816658401
Since the treatment of myasthenia gravis is directed at the pathogenetic mechanisms of the disease an early diagnosis is of great significance for the course of the disease.	1.1854099582948232
Also, a false positive diagnosis of myasthenia has to be avoided because of the potentially hazardous side effects of the therapy.	1.2664845328123404
The mainstay of the diagnosis is the history and a subtle clinical examination with tests of excessive muscle fatiguability.	1.2015514432919334
The injection of edrophonium (Tensilon), the electrodiagnostic testing after repitive stimulation (decrement test) and the testing for serum antibodies against acetylcholin receptors have to be performed to secure the diagnosis of myasthenia.	1.2018317465066015
The edrophonium test and the decrement test can yield false positive results in other neuromuscular diseases.	0.7926533461010397
Antibodies are present in 50% of ocular myasthenia and in 80-90% of the generalized form.	1.1900063425238772
The Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, other neuromuscular diseases, mitochondrial diseases, diseases of the cranial nerves, botulism and the rare congenital myasthenic syndromes have to be considered as differential diagnosis.	0.9388280981068163
The application of biodegradable implants is combined with advantages and disadvan- tages.	0.7633789344931246
They offer a great deal of innovative ideas.	0.7311021048330817
Best evaluation has been done with pins for the fixation of low loaded osteochondral fractures.	0.8383722937767455
When using 2,7 mm Polypin primary mechanical stabilility of distal radius fractures is comparable with the fixation by 1,8 mm K-wires.	0.9797331161629671
A prospective and randomised study with two years follow up, including 183 radial head fractures, showed no significant difference in results and complications in metal and polyactide implants.	1.251690003877534
For this localisation and other comparable indications the implant can be recommended.	0.8745001895356518
Despite the more extensive degradable device overall costs can be reduced with the polymer implant.	0.8843531130201983
Orien- truded polyactide screws showed good clinical results, newetheless resorption was extremely late within 5 to 7 years.	0.8323054319364648
The treatment of deep cartilage defects is a challenge for every orthopeadic surgeon.	1.0219906227987259
The potention for regeneration of cartilage tissue is minimal and leads to mechanically inferior fibrous tissue.	0.7423370621991158
The established techniques induce the growth of fibrous tissue but fail to prevent arthrosis.	0.8526725363390235
Autologous chondrocyte transplantation seems to be the most promising therapy concept with clinical relevance to reserves a full thickness cartilage defekt with hyaline-like cartilage.	0.9544899908839078
Outcome studies with a follow up from 2-10 years show in up to 90 % good and excellent results for defects on the femoral condyle and 70 % for the patella.	1.3492053701405897
Mechanical testing of the regenerated cartilage showed almost simular stiffness as nearly normal hyaline cartilage.	0.7425182762016146
The available data justify the acceptance of autologous chondrocyte transplantation as a standard procedure for limited indications and well-trained surgeons.	0.9873746660686985
Result of already inaugurated studies will show the potential of chondrocyte transplantation to prevent osteoarthritis.	0.8826902621018785
Vasculitides are rare diseases characterized by inflammation of blood vessels.	0.9289406054410527
According to diameter of the blood vessels involved in the inflammatory process, the clinical presentation and the histological appearance, different vasculitic syndromes may be distinguished.	1.2669845894904854
Primary vasculitides are of unknown origin while secondary vasculitides may be caused by drugs, malignancy or infection.	0.812219810073799
Panarteriitis nodosa caused by chronic Hepatitis B and mixed cryoglobulinemia secondary to chronic Hepatitis C are classical examples of vasculitides triggered by infections.	0.8776360623695405
However, these are rare complications of chronic viral hepatitis.	1.3618131176733568
Patients infected by HIV frequently suffer from vasculitis, which may be caused by opportunistic infections and by defects in immune regulation.	0.985218553682365
In numerous case reports, various other infectious particles have been reported to cause different forms of vasculitis, either by direct infection of endothelial cells or by induction of an immunologic process leading to blood vessel destruction.	1.0590478093646742
Immunologically mediated vasculitis secondary to infection may be due to a predisposing reactivity of the patient's immune system.	0.9439537739205152
After successful treatment of the infection, the vasculitis usually subsides.	0.9541691585514686
Therefore, all patients with vasculitis should be evaluated for underlying infection.	1.5417811581486858
To calculate canal compromise and decrease of midsagittal diameter caused by retropulsion of fragments into the spinal canal we analyzed the pre- and postoperative computed tomographies of 32 patients with unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures treated by USS (universal spine system).	1.020633714585649
Our intention was to examine the efficiency of ultrasound guided repositioning of the dispaced fragments which was performed in all 32 cases.	1.0317044133426925
We found a clear postoperative enlargement of canal area (ASP preoperatively 55 %, postop.	1.1616272801249863
80 %) and midsagittal diameter (MSD preop.	0.9010638492940186
10 of 13 patients presented a postoperative improvement of neurological deficit, no neurological deterioration occured.	1.047734655804597
Fractures with neurological deficit showed more canal compromise (52 %) and less midsagittal diameter (MSD compromise 51 %) than those without (40 % or 39 %).	1.1897590482677514
There was no correlation between the percentage of spinal canal stenosis and the severity of neurological deficit.	0.9025109179720094
Below L 1 the spinal canal is greater than between Th 11 and L 1, so a more important spinal stenosis is tolerated.	1.112725753389333
In case of unstable burst fractures with neurological deficit the ultrasound guided spinal fracture reposition is an effective procedure concerning the necessary improvement of spinal stenosis: an additional ventral approach for the revision of the spinal canal is unneeded.	1.0683168436362018
In fractures without neurologic deficit the repositioning of the displaced fragments promises an avoidance of long-term damages such as myelopathia and claudicatio spinalis.	0.7972897725562978
In common the traumatic spondylolisthesis is not a life threatening injury.	0.9426301917231991
An exact diagnosis is mandatory as well as a differentiated therapy.	1.1493416874998201
Especially the correct decision about the therapy (operative vs conservative) including the technical demanding operative procedures is based on an experienced surgeon.	1.1506109302586283
These patients should be transferred to a specialised centre.	0.7722832731375542
The intensity of DNA degradation in fixed tissues is dependent on the fixation solution and the fixation time.	0.9794069592673353
The aim of this study was the investigation of DNA degradation over fixation times of up to 70 days in different tissues (muscle, brain, liver, bone) and with different formalin concentration (2 %, 4 %, 8 %; unbuffered).	1.3592302822390252
An additional test was performed to see whether the fixed tissues could be individualized using PCR analysis.	0.9816683225985297
The smallest amounts of DNA were extracted from liver and brain and the largest from muscle and bone.	0.8802490113249285
The amount of DNA that could be extracted decreased with increasing formalin concentration, while at the same time DNA degradation increased.	1.091589812924074
With the PCR-VNTR system HUMTH 01, all fixed samples could be typed regardless of the fixation time and the formalin concentration.	0.9908293592774036
The draining sinus is an unpleasant complication of acne conglobata, acne fulminans, acne inversa, rosacea conglobata and rosacea fulminans (pyoderma faciale).	0.8751828497755384
It is most common on the face, especially in the nasolabial folds, and on the neck below the mandibular line.	1.0516709952102499
Clinically, it is an elongated (2-5 cm long), elevated, periodically inflamed lesion, which sporadically discharges pus.	1.4016916825971106
The lesion persists with no tendency to spontaneous regression.	0.7642466134894143
Histopathologically, it consists of elaborate, epithelialized galleries connected to the skin surface at multiple points.	1.0828137290934443
It contains corneocytes, hairs, bacteria, serum, inflammatory cells and epitheloid granulomas.	0.9719759563016112
A surgical thread placed into the skin provides a model in which the generation of sinus tracts can be studied.	0.9159301466120808
Intralesional corticosteroid injection, cryosurgery and isotretinoin are not always very effective.	0.8197336161889837
Sometimes complete excision of the lesion is necessary.	0.9181408392716462
The draining sinus is a special form of scar analogous to the pilonidal cyst.	0.792060616723168
A thoracic outlet syndrome is only rarely caused by osseous anomalies.	0.7916379286930751
Instead, it is a soft-tissue disease, where the C8 and T1 roots or the proximal inferior trunk of the brachial plexus are compressed by fibromuscular anomalies between the inferior cervical spine and the first rib or pleura.	1.1566779254279547
Thoracic outlet syndrome is a clinical diagnosis.	0.8982835612989721
If surgery is recommended, it should be concentrated on the fibromuscular anomalies and not on the first rib.	1.0747685431679148
Transaxillary removal of the first rib carries an important risk of serious complications.	1.2524414182023347
Among these, brachial plexus injury is the most frequent one.	1.0522092509152219
Objective: The objective of this survey was to investigate the current status of the epidural and intrathecal management in patients with chronic cancer and non-cancer pain in Germany and Austria.	1.2701749556971096
Methods: In June 1997 a questionnaire was sent to 598 German and Austrian anaesthesiologists specialized in pain therapy.	0.9255680685616781
Questions concerning the use of medicaments for epidural and intrathecal treatment of chronic pain were asked.	0.9411027946681377
Results: The response rate was 23%.	1.0465956514437393
The data show that 78% of the anaesthesiologists use epidural or intrathecal analgesia in the therapy of chronic pain.	1.0629147266751813
Local anaesthetics are used by 85% of these anaesthesiologists, followed by morphine (72%), clonidine (48%), buprenorphine (34%), baclofen (20%), fentanyl (13%) and sufentanil (10%).	1.3791057823626578
For most of the treatments local anaesthetics are used, again followed by opioids und clonidine.	0.9976888191853841
In the 137 answering pain clinics 79.821 epidural and intrathecal analgetic treatments are performed per year.	0.7630767258892094
Discussion: Epidural and intrathecal pain therapy is frequently used in Germany and Austria, either as a complementary or alternative treatment to systemic pain therapy.	1.1132588441926485
Local anaesthetics followed by opioids are the most commonly used medicaments for this treatment.	0.8701306596048833
For some of the applied substances neurotoxicological data are lacking.	0.8836282537123011
The use of these substances has to be considered very carefully.	1.2019221977682575
Intraartial conduction disturbances (IACD) are the known substrate of re-entrant atrial arrhythmias and their diagnosis is important for the selection of proper therapy.	1.0387637035717106
Signs of IACD can be missed on the standard ECG, and signal averaged (SA) P wave analysis has proved valuable for the evaluation of electrophysiological (EPS) properties of atrial myocardium.	1.0211840447815932
Unfavourable EPS effects of RAA pacing are known to electrophysiologists, but this aspect is rarely considered in normal practice, and RAA based pacing modes remain standard even for pts.	1.0555968062249763
We examined and compared EPS effects of different atrial pacing modes using two diagnostic tools: IEGM obtained from two atrial leads of biatrial pacing system (via telemetry) and time domain analysis of SA P wave in 22 pts.	0.9937685825226167
with BiA pacing system (implanted due to atrial arrhythmias and IACD).	0.7190153214652363
The results showed that different atrial pacing modes influence atrial activation timing parameters differently: RAA pacing aggravates IACD in comparison to sinus rhythm; the effects of CS pacing is less visible.	0.8922210872551317
BiA pacing normalises all atrial activation times.	0.5387266499864907
The normalisation of SA P wave duration, reduction of SA P wave dispersion, increasing of RMS 20 and decreasing of LAS 5 and finally abolition of presence of late atrial potentials in most of pts.	0.9922317879776686
indicates beneficial effects of BiA pacing (in pts.	0.933719683428382
with IACD) in comparison to sinus rhythm and RAA pacing.	0.9150955179365953
Unfavourable EPS effects of RAA pacing in patients with IACD indicates suitability the need for alternative (resynchronising) atrial pacing modes.	0.8622477668119098
Time domain analysis of SA P wave is a valuable and sensitive diagnostic tool for non-invasive evaluation of EPS effects of different modes of atrial pacing.	0.979209842747527
Background: We report a case of irreversible unilateral hypoglossal nerve palsy in connection with nasal septum surgery in intubation anaesthesia.	1.057131062166905
On account of the spatial distance, there is no danger of injuring the hypoglossal nerve during nasal surgery.	0.8728073819757547
However, in the otorhinolaryngological and anaesthesiological literature, some cases of hypoglossal palsy following endotracheal intubation, use of the laryngeal mask airway, bronchoscopy and laryngoscopy are reported.	1.120253742074202
The endoscopic guided puncture tracheostomy has established itself in many intensive care units.	0.7953410603316339
Manufacturers offer complete tracheostomy kits, based on the described techniques from Ciaglia (Cook-Set), as well as from Griggs (Portex-Set).	0.9409713895727161
The goal of this investigation was to show the advantages, disadvantages, costs and risks of the puncture tracheostomy and to make a comparison using conventional procedures.	1.0866045124946868
Chronic lymphoplasmacellular osteomyelitis may occur in children, adolescents and adults, but has not been found in newborns or babies either in our series or in the literature.	1.0448371247422743
Symptoms suggesting an acute disease like fever are uncommon, but a primary chronic course with symptomatic and asymptomatic periods is typical.	1.0508164874421968
Pain and swelling are the main symptoms; painless masses are rare.	0.9972471480407726
In children and adolescents the clavicle and metaphyseal regions of long bones are typical sites of chronic abacterial osteomyelitis.	0.9693611008624629
In adults the clavicles or the first two ribs are mainly affected with synovitis of the adjacent joints, but the long bones are rarely involved.	1.18750938713193
Laboratory findings are non-specific but important for the differential diagnosis.	0.9218782684309619
The sedimentation rate and c-reactive protein might be elevated.	0.7783158786039558
The X-ray examination shows osteolytic, sclerotic or mixed bony changes and, in case of a diaphyseal involvement, onionskinlike periosteal bone formation may be present, suggesting a malignant process.	1.0761008593130892
In late stages sclerotic bone formations may be seen as a rest.	0.8388394869401432
Uni- or multifocal lesions can be detected by bonescan, as can asymptomatic lesions.	1.1674691088768439
Magnetic resonance imaging shows gross signal intensity differences both in the bone and perifocal soft tissue and involvement of the synovium with gadolinium DPTA enhancement in T1-weighted images.	1.0029847010726927
In early stages of the disease granulocytes, microabscesses and new bone formations might suggest bacterial osteomyelitis that cannot be differentiated by histology.	0.9558431593124708
In intermediate phases lymphocytic and plasmacellular infiltrates are found, whereas in late phases sclerotic bone formations and fibrosis of the bone marrow are seen histologically.	1.0101728701132335
In chronic lymphoplasmacellular osteomyelitis, all clinical, radiological and histological findings, as well as negative bacteriological cultures, are mandatory and will allow a definitive diagnosis to be made.	0.9511144724223688
The disease may be uni- or multifocal, and new bone lesions may occur over time, as well as skin manifestations, which can be found years before or after bone involvement.	1.1447197808638947
The association with dermatological diseases and/or synovitis led to the acronym SAPHO syndrome (synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, osteomyelitis).	0.9797312958777166
For the treatment non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are effective for pain relief, reduction of swelling and dysfunction.	1.142731805457897
Antibiotics have been used in several series and are not effective.	1.158656523224008
Major surgery is not recommended even for recurrences, and the prognosis for growth and function is excellent in the long term despite recurrences over several years.	1.3027189707582993
A woman with severe stiff-man syndrome showed periodic cardiovascular dysregulation.	0.8834691509612458
The blood pressure changed spontaneously every 5-10 min.	0.9959050608502559
This rhythm was also maintained after relaxation.	0.6881273841321969
However, the vegetative and motoric disturbances disappeared after intrathecal application of baclofen.	0.9021476121960471
It is speculated that spinal GABAergic mechanisms are responsible for the tonic regulation of the cardiovascular system.	0.8467591642851049
The frequency and prognostic relevance of sarcoid-likelesions and microcarcinosis in regional lymph nodes in gastric cancer (n = 113; pT1-3, pN0-1, pM0, R0) were investigated; the prognostic value was compared with pT and pN stage, grading and Laurén's tumor classification with Cox's multivariate regression-model.	1.0278164199371547
Sarcoid like lesions were found in 34 % of the cases (n = 113).	1.0327384200406287
Statistical analysis did not indicate that they had any prognostic value or showed whether or not microcarcinosis or metastasis was present; they were independent of pT stage, histological tumor type, tumor grading, and the clinical course of disease.	1.175334237944301
Microcarcinosis (defined as scattered carcinoma cells within lymph node sinuses or pulp without adjacent stromal reaction) was revealed by immunohistochemistry in 90 % of pN0 cases; the presence of 3 or more tumor cells per lymph node section in over 10 % of sampled lymph nodes per case carried a significant prognostic value.	1.1319439779862703
In microcarcinosis without evidence of metastasis, the number of tumor cells and the number of involved lymph nodes are of prognostic value.	0.9802927472148872
In pN1 cases microcarcinosis was found as well as the metastases in 97 % and had no additional prognostic value.	1.446043787528204
Microcarcinosis alone has a different significance from lymph node metastasis for prognosis.	0.8557799812593974
This article summarizes the most important results of the Turku Conference on active strategies for an aging workforce, which took place in Turku/Finland in 1999.	1.0309545842154733
About 140 experts from all EU-member states participated.	0.6705789756874829
The article can be seen as a contribution to the current change in the debate on labor market policy concerning older workers in Germany.	0.9661771462019152
The incidence of coronary artery aneurysm varies in the range from 0.2% to 4.9%.	1.414825317205937
Ninety per cent of these were associated with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, where vessel ectasia and poststenotic dilatations are not an infrequent finding.	0.9730946158855951
We present the case of a 67 year old patient with coronary artery aneurysm and coexisting coronary artery disease of the right coronary artery.	1.1455352734213375
The patient was symptomatic and had a posterolateral myocardial infarction.	1.0386195602863577
We performed a PTCA and stent-implantation of the stenosis and coronary artery aneurysm of the right coronary artery.	1.0459580771898123
After the procedure, the patient could be discharged without angina pectoris.	1.0968787388179262
A control-angiography will be performed six months later.	0.8376175016695999
TMLR (Transmyocardial laser revascularization) is a disputed cardiosurgical technique available in Europe since 1994 that aims to deliver additional blood flow to ischemic myocardium from the left heart chamber.	0.9971409738990118
Goal of our study is morphological examination of laser channels in human hearts to answer the questions: Are there patent laser channels with communication to the left chamber and to intramural vessels?	1.1267423682801774
We examined hearts of 10 patients who died during the first 18 days after TMLR.	1.034600920315261
Channels were examined in histological serial sections under the light microscope.	0.8985130753580305
Laser channels in the first days postoperatively have a lumen diameter of about 1 mm and are surrounded by coagulation necrosis about 500 µm thick.	1.028126781139274
Despite phagocytic removal of necrotic tissue the lumen diameter decreases during the following two weeks.	0.8690062126641264
Open intramyocardial channels can be shown in all patients.	0.7532991691918565
These channels communicate with intramural vessels, but in no instance with chamber lumen.	1.011773029915091
Our results suggest that clinical benefits are based on improved distribution of coronary blood.	0.8746545009110281
Additional blood is not delivered from left chamber lumen to the myocardium.	0.7945050872237116
However, our patients represent the small subgroup of the deceased.	1.398378325849791
If similar observations can be made in the majority of patients living symptomfree after TMLR remains open.	1.0147055026019054
Recurrent miscarriages are, like sporadically occurring miscarriage, often (approx.	0.9157095109631629
50 %) due to chromosomal aberrations.	1.0222888499346985
An undefined proportion of the other half may be due to immunological incompliances.	0.9036265290513594
The basis for this assumption is the fact that the maternal immune system recognizes paternal antigens and rejects them.	1.006909071938131
The initial hypothesis that such immune reaction is due to a high similarity between the maternal and paternal HLA systems (HLA sharing) is most likely incorrect.	1.0841537261952479
Nevertheless, the incomplete recognition of the fetus by the maternal immune system and the resulting insufficient protection is basis for the active immune therapy with partner or donor lymphocytes.	1.1242334904027387
Several placebo-controlled studies have been performed.	0.9772496813166475
Due to the small number of cases, results were not significant.	1.0562218099978549
A metaanalysis of all studies, however, proves significant effects of the active immune therapy.	0.9912820173640202
The risks of active immune therapy led to the development of passive immune therapy with immune globulins (IVIG).	0.9398378302474683
This therapy, however, is relatively expensive and obviously no more successful than the active immune therapy.	0.9422712876776176
In a metaanalysis of all published results, IVIG was not significantly more effective than treatment with placebo.	0.9685213156536443
The indication for both forms of immune therapy is given after 3 or more consecutive abortions, after exclusion of other reasons for these abortions.	1.0930700291970579
It appears that only primary aborting patients are suitable for active immune therapy.	0.7770108728562384
Athough the concept of immune therapy is still under debate, alternative concepts are not available.	1.0137811776262504
Hence, new therapeutic approaches are also not available.	1.0775622615239056
The first electronic implantable hearing aids for patients with hearing loss are coupled to the ossicular chain or perilymph during implantation and are now available.	0.9418134129794181
Our new Tübingen implant designed for sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is the combination of an implantable microphone and piezotransducer.	1.0465104938114418
To avoid hearing losses during implantation, the Tübingen piezotransducer will be (1) fixed to the mastoid cavity and (2) positioned to one of the ossicular target points.	1.142686255125261
This can be done with a micromanipulator which will be implanted together with transducer and microphone in the mastoid cavity.	1.0160616378867224
The manipulator weights 0.7 g. With four degrees of freedom, it allows highly secure and safe positioning of the transducer's probe tip to the ossicular chain under close to stereotactic conditions.	1.233784366937733
The main advantages of the present micromanipulator are (1) easy handling during surgery, (2) the transducer's precise positioning to the ossicular target point with sufficient degrees of freedom, and (3) the transducer's stable fixation in the mastoid cavity in the final position.	1.1712383960773705
Following integrated safety as the leading principle, ossicular or inner ear injuries caused, e.g., by the patient's head movement or unintentional manual contact by the surgeon, are minimized.	1.1157916191580886
The micromanipulator is, as it were, the surgeon's vibration-free "artificial hand".	1.2058876675594346
The manipulator's development and its optimization to the mastoid cavity by test implantation in 50 human temporal bones are shown in detail.	0.9218383685046333
While coupling the transducer to the body of the incus, transducer, microphone, and micromanipulator can be implanted into 76% of all mastoid cavities without protrusion.	1.038467410732519
In the case of transducers coupling to the long process of the incus, the protrusion-free implantation rate of the above-mentioned three implant modules is 78%.	1.026814354123274
The role of neuroimaging in the acute setting of head trauma is to diagnose the extent of intracranial injury and to identify all lesions which require urgent neurosurgical treatment.	1.0820499022164916
Computed tomography (CT) remains the most important diagnostic tool for initial screening of trauma victims.	1.0621188631267247
Although magnetic resonance imaging (MR) has higher sensitivity to most traumatic lesions than CT, due to the ease and speed of CT, and the fact that sufficient monitoring of critically ill patients during the examination is much easier with CT than with MR, mean that MR is not the imaging modality of choice for the initial diagnostic work-up.	1.19749991650927
Recent MR techniques such as FLAIR or diffusion imaging further improve the sensitivity of MR in head trauma.	0.8441024598590194
Conventional angiography is currently indicated only for few suspected vascular lesions (e.g.	0.6294286237343933
traumatic arterio-venous fistulas, vascular dissections).	0.9011233156863804
Injuries to the posterior cruciate ligament are among the major injuries to the knee joint.	0.89666087106621
Today we are often confronted with an inapproprate and delayed diagnosis of this injury and its concomitant lesions.	0.9713313690306045
Additionally, the outcome of operative treatment has not yet reached an acceptable rate of satisfactory results.	1.1131335269386056
Therefore, the goal of this current concept review is to give a comprehensive insight into anatomy and biomechanics, injury mechanisms and pathobiomechanics, based on our experiences and data from the international literature.	1.1014848240935688
A further goal is to clarify diagnostic problems with respect to clinical examination and imaging techniques.	0.981700102730796
We also present a differential concept for the perioperative and conservative management of posterior cruciate ligament deficient knees in order to also adequately address concomitant injuries such as posterolateral rotatory instability and combined anterior cruciate ligament injuries with the aim of further improving results.	1.1070591487563515
Sevoflurane, like all currently used volatile anaesthetics, is degraded by carbon dioxide absorbents.	0.9044395656391971
The most significant degradant is a haloalkene known trivially as "compound A".	0.8630023636673955
Compound A is nephrotoxic in rats and, at higher doses, in nonhuman primates, causing proximal tubular necrosis.	1.092717131661028
There has been much interest in the potential for compound A toxicity in humans.	0.9966575402778047
Inhaled compound A concentrations are greatest at low flow rates, high sevoflurane concentrations, warmer absorbent, barium hydroxide vs soda lime, and drier absorbent.	0.9891645898925542
Typical inspired compound A concentrations during low-flow and closed-circuit sevoflurane anaesthesia in humans are 8-24 and 20-32 ppm with soda lime and barium hydroxide lime, respectively.	0.9713388968108689
Renal effects of compound A production during sevoflurane anesthesia have been examined in surgical patients and volunteers, using standard (creatinine clearance, serum BUN and creatinine) and experimental (urine excretion of protein, glucose, NAG, GST, AAP) markers of renal function.	0.9928291300618821
Investigations to date in surgical patients show similar renal effects of low-flow sevoflurane, low-flow isoflurane or high-flow sevoflurane.	1.24957937717238
There have been no case reports of compound A-associated renal injury in humans.	0.9672872757234835
In volunteers, one study found changes in experimental but not conventional renal markers, while other investigations show no significant changes in either standard or experimental markers.	1.0472196131439349
The mechanism of compound A nephrotoxicity in rats appears to involve metabolism to glutathione and cysteine conjugates, and their subsequent renal uptake and metabolism by pathways that are different in rats and humans.	1.0029625288818702
In the report of the 1995 World Health Federation/International Society and Federation of Cardiology (WHF/ISFC) Task Force on the Definition and Classification of Cardiomyopathies, the definition of heart muscle diseases was updated.	0.961636690394529
Idiopathic, autoimmune, and infectious forms of inflammatory cardiomyopathy are now recognized in this definition.	0.9868127362382989
Enteroviruses, adenoviruses and cytomegaloviruses are considered as main etiopathological factors in the pathogenesis of inflammatory heart disease.	0.8828420900579287
We report our experience in managing a temporal bone fracture after head trauma that had no apparent clinical signs.	0.9517340238676535
Recurrent CSF rhinorrhea and meningitis lead to extensive diagnostic procedures.	0.6986321201165367
Operative exploration of the temporal bone demonstrated a fracture line along the horizontal part of the carotid artery.	1.003243467070562
The location of the fracture did not cause such typical symptoms as hearing impairment, facial paralysis, vertigo or tinnitus.	1.0138355012685631
Only CSF liquorrhea through the Eustachian tube indicated a fracture at the lateral skull base.	0.8738049146705364
Hyperkeratosis lenticularis perstans (Flegel's disease) is a rare but clinically and histologically highly characteristic genodermatosis.	1.03610516173687
We report on new immunohistochemical and ultrastructural findings suggesting a complex disorder of epidermal differentiation.	1.1268676185774857
In this context, a good response to calcipotriol, a synthetic vitamin D3 derivative is of particular interest.	1.1170257674650814
Pulmonary embolism is a frequent and potentially life-threatening event with uncharacteristic clinical manifestations.	1.0471386025625318
Diagnosis is commonly established by ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy and pulmonary angiography.	0.8103910158779569
Both methods, however, carry substantial drawbacks.	1.006274989276793
Therefore, clinicians claim that there is a need for an accurate and non-invasive diagnostic modality.	1.2296973851855484
Spiral CT of the pulmonary arteries is a recent modality, that allows reliable visualization of emboli in pulmonary arteries up to fourth-order branches.	1.066329038247211
This paper reviews the technical aspects, typical findings and diagnostic pitfalls of this recent technique.	0.9724435646714706
The potential role of spiral CT in the screening of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism is discussed and selected cases are presented.	1.2132138332733258
Introduction: Interleukin-12-p70 (IL-12-p70) is a potent immunoregulatory cytokine composed of a heavy chain (p40) and a light chain (p35).	1.278568829883561
Contradicting results have been reported with regard to leukocyte release and systemic concentration of IL-12 after polytrauma.	1.1073462943807553
Methods: We daily analyzed systemic concentrations of IL-12 in polytrauma patients (n = 37, mean ISS 33.9) in comparison to healthy donor values during intensive care course by ELISA.	1.2319296960604345
Patients were divided according to their mean IL-12 levels into those with elevated IL-12 (group 1, n = 7), those with decreased IL-12 (group 2, n = 4) and those with IL-12 in the normal range (group 3, n = 26).	1.324165482336358
Results: Patients in group 1 revealed elevated levels of IL-12 up to p70 > 1000 pg/ml and p40 > 2500 pg/ml.	1.2113873252522298
The common clinical feature of group 1 was a thorax trauma in combination with pneumonia (85 % survivors).	1.0037771512901417
Patients with single thorax trauma or pneumonia without thorax trauma (group 3) showed normal IL-12 values.	1.2453671600546037
Patients with decreased IL-12 levels revealed also a thorax trauma and pneumonia but all patients succumbed.	0.8356896693394408
The groups significantly differ in their stay in the intensive care unit, in TISS, in MODS score and in respiratory ratio, but not in ISS, mean CRP values and leukocyte counts.	1.242250869200579
Correlation analysis revealed no significant relation between systemically altered IL-12 values and clinical parameters, with the exception of a negative correlation of p70 and ISS (r = -0.785) or MODS score (r = -0.314) in group 1.	1.074791276374076
Conclusions: After major injuries there is no overall suppression of IL-12 formation.	1.3096793524404933
Patients with normal or elevated IL-12 levels belong mainly to the survivors, whereas patients with decreased IL-12 levels are at high risk of succumbing to multi-organ failure.	1.0403244830602614
This article reviews the pathogenesis and clinical and imaging findings in shoulder impingement syndrome.	0.9573258077150011
Shoulder impingement is caused by compression of the supraspinatus tendon underneath the coracoacromial arch, mainly in forward flexion of the arm.	0.8530027783422623
Different stages of impingement syndrome are described.	0.6804624084451527
Stage I relates to edema and hemorrhage of the supraspinatus tendon.	0.677773607794076
Stage II is characterized by bursal inflammation and fibrosis, as well as tendinopathy.	0.7986428654891405
In stage III there is a tear of the rotator cuff.	0.8829976476223663
Moreover, calcifying tendinitis, fractures and pain originating from the cervical spine may mimic shoulder impingement syndrome.	1.027755052528431
Imaging is important for the exact diagnosis.	0.8466459591339395
Standard radiographs are the basis of imaging in shoulder impingement syndrome.	0.8276589217975753
They may demonstrate subchondral sclerosis of the major tuberosity, subacromial spurs, and form anomalies of the acromion.	1.0027202062573566
They are also important in the differential diagnosis of shoulder impingement syndrome and demonstrate calcifying tendinitis, fractures and neoplasm.	0.95959042392906
Ultrasonography has found acceptance as a screening tool and even as a final diagnostic method by many authors.	1.0079663125124205
However, there is a high interobserver variability in the demonstration of rotator cuff tears.	1.141200681707702
Its usefulness has therefore been questioned.	0.6019645954267603
MR imaging is probably the method of choice in the evaluation of the rotator cuff and surrounding structures.	0.9144275925661571
Several investigations have demonstrated that differentiation of early findings, such as tendinopathy versus partial tears, may be difficult with MR imaging.	1.0948418551146373
However, reproducibility for full-thickness tears appears to be higher than for sonography.	1.1184006893173377
Moreover, specificity appears to be superior to sonography.	1.1565520495294837
MR arthrography is not universally accepted.	0.7122397449334893
However, it allows for more exact differentiation of discrete findings and may be indicated in preoperative planning.	1.2713281255564703
Standard arthrography and CT have a limited role in the current assessment of the rotator cuff.	1.0378752437263044
Gastric carcinoma of the infiltrative type (according to Ming) occasionally shows adenomatous differentiation only.	0.8670138947260216
Over the past 18 years, we have observed 23 cases of this tumour type, accounting for 3.6 % of all surgically treated gastric carcinomas.	1.3077737082443193
Macroscopically they were classified as Borrmann IV or III, while histologically most of them were well differentiated.	1.0577501617885938
Histologically, these tumours retained the pre-existing structures of the stomach, most readily observable at the tunica muscularis propria; a pronounced desmoplasia was also characteristic, particularly in the submucosal and subserosal layers.	1.0817392247885482
In all cases the tumour tissue spread inside lymphatic vessels.	0.9594763320153994
All but 2 cases with metastatically involved lymph nodes, often small, showed infiltration of the lymph node sinus; in three quarters of cases the serosa was infiltrated by the tumour.	1.1892113550496577
Significant findings among the patients under observation for extended periods included bilateral ovarian metastases in 4 of 5 women examined and tumour recurrence at the anastomosis in 6 of 9 patients in whom Billroth II operation had been performed.	1.0045573984073548
The mean survival time of 16 patients was 14.9 months.	0.9658239993979282
Owing to the diffuse type of tumour growth, extensive surgery is recommended as in cases of signet ring cell cancer.	1.066158003849438
The high incidence of small lymph node metastases from this type of tumour should also be taken in account at preoperative staging.	1.0144462702600312
Preoperative diagnosis of this tumour subtype is difficult, because histological criteria alone do not allow clear identification.	1.0988872336046052
Close cooperation with clinical investigators is necessary, and intraoperative assessment of the tumour - including frozen section of necessary - in particular is of the outmost importance.	1.4022669308295916
One rare case of so-called massive idiopathic osteolysis Gorham-Stout is presented.	0.7581040452448092
In a 77-year-old female patient the whole right femoral head and neck of femur was resorbed within 2.5 month following trauma.	1.1686489769602637
As a histologic cause for the osteolysis, a marked stimulation of osteoclasts on the spongiosa, especially intracortically, was observed.	1.1723333211500866
The course and the clinical findings are described, and the pathogenesis and treatment are discussed in comparison with the present literature.	1.53391530512131
The results suggest that an early antiresorptive therapy (calcitonin, bisphosphonates) could stop the progressive osteolytic changes.	0.9811199662926984
In this paper the relationship between psychodiagnosis and client-centered therapy is discussed.	1.0005635989965618
Rogers is wrongly said to have rejected any kind of diagnosis and that this therapy form has therefore developed an ambiguous relationship to this issue.	0.962995545259555
If one sees psychodiagnosis as something psychodynamic, and symptoms as defense strategies against underlying conflicts, then a comprehensive 'status diagnosis' using more or less traditional psychiatric categories appears compatible with theory-led client-centered diagnosis in the initial phase and during the course of therapy.	1.0097846307764837
Client-centered psychotherapy itself may be seen as a continuous process of dialogue in which 'assumed diagnoses' (embedded in the therapist's 'empathic knowledge') are jointly checked and in which the client through direct experience learns to understand and change his 'diagnosis'.	0.988461126936521
In the examination of reversible segmental (articular) hypomobile dysfunction (blockage) of the spine, we have to recognize by palpation the feeling of beginning resistance at the end of the passive movement ("barrier").	1.137389316339568
This is the main finding to diagnose segmental (articular) dysfunction.	0.8717863042255823
Normal mobility gives us a slowly increasing resistance with possible springing at the end.	0.957117623550737
In contrary, the sudden feeling of hard tension without springing is seen as typical for the restricted movement in articular dysfunction, i. e. restriction of joint facet gliding.	0.9349975976608004
Multiple intra- and paraglandular lymph nodes develop in the parotid gland, including salivary gland tissue with acinar and ductal formations.	1.0310518162640983
In the same way heterotopic salivary gland tissue can be localized in cervical lymph nodes.	0.9875023923363925
Except for the frequently occurring Warthin tumours, primary salivary gland tumours, which develop in the lymph nodes of the parotid gland or the cervical lymph nodes, are rare.	1.161592029960722
Examples of these are adenomas (pleomorphic adenoma, basal cell adenoma) and carcinomas (acinic cell carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma).	0.9095748646588298
Three of our own observations (sebaceous lymphadenoma, acinic cell carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma) are analysed.	0.9257476068333048
The condition for the diagnosis of primary salivary gland tumour within a lymph node is reliable evidence that the salivary gland tissue is tumour-free and that no other occult carcinoma is present.	1.0703445665891769
We report on a three month old infant presenting with vaginal bleeding.	1.0749820801169514
Precocious pseudopuberty due to an autonomous ovarian cyst was diagnosed.	0.7752996215679676
Within three months the follicular cyst spontaneously regressed.	0.7834196734735099
Elevated estradiol levels also decreased spontaneously.	0.5373899020322701
The purpose of this study was to determine whether 24 hour patch testing with 0.5% sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) could reliably predict skin susceptibility to an irritant when compared with the alkali resistance test (ART), a widely used method employing sodium hydroxide.	1.1119828090397181
After having given informed consent, 40 patients (age range from 20 to 60 years) with an active irritant contact dermatitis (ICD), 40 patients in whom ICD had cleared, as well as 40 healthy volunteers serving as controls were tested.	1.1535709637109777
The skin responses to SLS were assessed both visually and by measurement of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) as an indicator of stratum corneum integrity.	0.9831770499487006
SLS significantly increased the erythema scores and TEWL in patients with healed ICD, and the increase of TEWL was even more pronounced in patients with active ICD.	1.2000046181541382
By contrast, a decrease in alkali resistance was found in patients with active ICD only but not in patients with healed ICD.	1.1240886921323172
The data obtained indicate that the SLS test, unlike ART, may provide a non-invasive tool predicting a possible constitutional skin susceptibility or indicating a subclinically impaired epidermal barrier function.	1.0175751879540595
However, because of the relatively high interindividual variation, a cut-clear statement concerning the skin susceptibility cannot be made by this test.	1.208445897581732
On the other hand, the ART seems only to be useful for following and documenting the healing period following ICD.	0.9006040352340527
Introduction: The correction of low to moderate astigmatism is possible today by means of photoablation (PRK), while the treatment of moderate and higher astigmatism still involves refractive keratotomy.	1.1785078294795954
Experience has shown that cataract surgery, using modern tunnel techniques with self-healing incisions, results in earlier stability in both the refractive outcome and wound healing.	1.081623983611476
In this study, we attempted to combine the advantages of lamellar keratotomy with those of a pair-wise T-incision as arcuate lamellar keratotomy (ALK).	0.9868164187892356
An often unrecognized but potentially fatal complication, mostly seen in posttraumatic patients under intensive care, is reactive acute cholecystitis.	0.9777340479462321
On account of the high specificity of ultrasound diagnosis in the biliary system we decided to examine the ultrasound criteria for early detection of posttraumatic cholecystitis.	1.0611858636109148
Ultrasound of the abdomen was performed prospectively, seven times on different days, in each of 40 artificially respirated patients under intensive care conditions over a period of 12 months.	1.0967114591798137
The results show that artificial respiration, parenteral feeding and previous trauma can lead to tardive (28/40) wallthickening or to a three-layered wall of the gallbladder (9/40).	0.9771051031876942
In 22.5 % of patients (9/40) we found the sonographic signs of acute cholecystitis.	1.1377807598111638
In correlation with the clinical signs, cholecystectomy was indicated in only two patients.	0.9519574109493305
The preoperative ultrasonographic findings and clinical signs of 23 patients with the diagnosis of acute reactive cholecystitis were analysed retrospectively.	1.0349263012892544
We found good correlation between sonographic and clinical signs of acute cholecystitis in 21 of these 23 patients.	0.8988348272956296
Our study shows that the morphological correlate of a thickened three-layered gallbladder wall can occur in the context of systemic alterations, even if there is no underlying cholecystitis.	1.1068513687739938
The diagnosis of acute reactive cholecystitis and the indication for cholecystectomy should be based on the synopsis of pathologic and clinical findings.	1.0248098575365654
Osteoporosis is characterized by reduced bone mass and a deterioration of bone structure which results in an increased fracture risk.	1.033006506294698
The purpose of this review is to evaluate structure analysis techniques in the diagnosis of osteoporosis.	0.9420846098469035
Several imaging techniques were applied to analyze trabecular bone, such as conventional radiography, high-resolution computed tomography (HR-CT) and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI).	1.1880243773207857
The best results were obtained using high-resolution tomographic techniques.	1.050669174345179
The highest spatial resolutions in vivo were achieved using HR-MRI.	0.7406784963619271
These studies show that texture parameters and bone mineral density predict bone strength and osteoporotic fractures in a complementary fashion.	0.9347080193275163
Combining both techniques yields the best results in the diagnosis of osteoporosis.	0.9718941673480214
Classification of cosmetics, which are more and more similar to topical therapeutic agents, is getting increasingly difficult for dermatologists.	1.1181018907018825
Their definition within the EU and the respective European directives, replacing national laws step by step, will be briefly presented.	0.778153771638927
The problems of distinguishing cosmetics from medicinal products will be discusssed in detail by examples from clinical practice.	0.7778387407261508
Finally, we will review the various active substances which tend to be added to cosmetics following the global trend in the cosmetic industry towards developing "medicinally" active cosmetics, and in the pharmaceutical industry towards "cosmetically" oriented medicinal products as part of a current "life-style" ideology.	1.1083297471706761
In some clinical dermatological fields these active substances may allow the dermatologists to use cosmetics as topical therapeutic agents.	0.8545812223748952
The decision whether a rotator cuff tear has a traumatic or degenerative origin still causes some controversy.	0.8430731805847336
Especially in medical expert appraisements the etiology of the rotator cuff tear plays an important role refering to insurance services for the patient.	0.9845811841058465
The purpose of this paper is to compare the intraoperative pathomorphologic shape of the cuff tear in traumatic and degenerative cases.	1.03856445257746
This study reports of 56 patients with rotator cuff tears which were devided in primarily acute, subacute traumatic and degenerative study groups refering to their history of present illness.	0.9440404892757146
We considered the location of the tear, the shape and the size.	1.1527134412307931
Furthermore the grade of retraction of the supraspinatus tendon, its quality and the shape of the long head of biceps were examined.	0.9761907926773746
The results showed that in general the shape of the tear gives only in some cases significant information whether the etiology is traumatic or not.	1.1454259212787319
The isolated rupture of the subscapularis muscle and the hematoma at the edge of the tendon is siginificant for the trauma.	0.960125796924133
In comparison with the degenerative study group the tenosynovitis and the dislocation of the long head of biceps is in our study sigificant for traumatic tears.	1.086508183784637
Health care decision making in incompetent severely ill patients presents many difficult medical, ethical, and legal problems for the physician.	0.9398229101117636
At the same time nurses represent the group of medical professionals who have the closest contact with the patient and who have to carry out most of the decisions and instructions.	1.2340387431645499
Barber's disease is produced by short hairs that penetrate the interdigital spaces of the hands.	0.967178592378779
The following chronic inflammatory reaction causes fistulas or sinuses and cysts.	0.8176190837017954
We present the case of a patient with interdigital pilonidal sinuses of all web spaces in both hands.	0.8533127996380427
Such an extensive case of this occupational disease has so far not been reported.	0.932114396439303
The treatment of critically ill patients compromises frequently between an adequate fluid resuscitation for maintenance of a sufficient regional perfusion on the one hand and the avoidance of pulmonary edema on the other hand.	0.9966449712012921
The application of the transpulmonary indicator dilution method allows the orientation of fluid therapy by using the parameters 'intrathoracic blood volume' and 'extravascular lung water'.	0.9115137205379388
This technique is less invasive than the pulmonary artery catheter since it only needs a 3 or 4 French catheter in the femoral artery.	1.066827560149983
Additionally, controlling the fluid therapy with the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is severely limited in the mechanically ventilated patient.	1.0351493692756524
Therefore, the intrathoracic blood volume may be of advantage in the critically care patient in comparison to the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure to assess the cardiac preload.	1.230829374771911
Furthermore, the indocyanine clearance adds a valuable parameter to assess liver function when the double indicator technique is used.	0.9436866640250969
Hypnosis, autogenic training, progressive relaxation and biofeedback show good empirical evidence concerning relaxation-therapy and are useful techniques in psycho- or behavior-therapy.	1.0238355394630767
Though they share some aspects with body-oriented psychotherapy these relaxation-techniques show a modern scientific orientation and are therefore to seperate from religious meditation.	0.9330673212689664
Though in details somewhat different, the methodology of these techniques creates a framework, in which the psychophysiological determined relaxation response is easily elicited.	1.110883543640081
However, regular practice of the patients is requiered.	1.695886185784707
Focussed attention, imagination and new attributions of bodily or mental perceptions play a dominant role concerning the therapeutic effects, which may contribute to enhanced internal selfcontrol and selfesteem.	0.9937470179849286
Controlled clinical studies give evidence to positive effects concerning various psychosomatic disorders (e.g.	0.672217834999159
headache, pain, ess.	0.8706233423089695
hypertension), as well as anxiety and sleeping disorders.	0.960988635197846
As components of psychotherapeutic or behavioral programs, there is even more evidence for effects of relaxation in a broad spectrum of disorders (e.g.	0.9243804893801124
Relaxation therapy is a well established and scientific-based component in the treatment of psychic, psychosomatic or psychiatric disorders, except psychosis.	1.128999719236552
Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis is a rare autosomal recessive connective tissue disease first described in 1873 by Murray.	0.9370082939048721
Major diagnostic criteria are multiple cutaneous tumors and gingival hypertrophy; minor criteria include contractures, osteolytic lesions and a positive family history.	0.9451773256167298
A 35-year-old woman suffering from Crohn's disease for 3 years developed painful erythematous nodular lesions predominantly on the dorsa of her hands and feet, as well as on her elbows and wrists.	0.9764560572590882
The clinical features and histopathological picture of leukocytoclastic vasculitis were both highly suggestive of erythema elevatum diutinum.	0.7899617995781507
No improvement of the skin lesions was observed during treatment with high doses of oral steroids.	1.3250213163901585
In contrast, treatment with dapsone resulted in a marked reduction of skin lesions.	0.9982968808666134
During a new attack of her Crohn's disease the erythema elevatum diutinum lesions flared again.	0.8606724647046587
The parallel clinical course of erythema elevatum diutinum and Crohn's disease, as well as the detection of immune complexes and neutrophilic granulocytes in lesions of both diseases, strongly suggest a common etiology.	1.0469830107586617
This hypothesis is discussed in context with this case and the recent literature.	1.0838451370880784
The mammalian brain is capable of a substantial functional reorganization, manifesting on a cortical somatotopical and on a behavioral level.	0.8556945231407213
Possible mechanisms are reviewed based on the work by others and ourselves on somatosensory reorganization in humans.	0.9360670559696573
The somatosensory system is characterized by divergent projections from the periphery to the cerebral cortex.	0.950193793848967
Changes in synaptic weights allow for reorganization of sensory processing: On one side, limb amputation will result in a representational "invasion" of the deafferentated cortex from neighboring regions with concomitant perceptual changes.	0.9611381971667949
On the other side, sensorimotor training can increase the representational cortical zone of a limb.	0.9997783576088106
Plastic changes can be temporary or persistent.	0.5783430176310864
Modulating factors like pain and certain drugs seem to induce a permissive state in the cortex resulting in enhanced reorganization.	0.8871623889620375
Thus, specific physical training combined with pharmacoceutical modulation holds promise to improve functional recovery after brain lesions.	1.0977559776735322
There have been some prospective randomized studies which compared primary angioplasty with intravenous thrombolysis in patients with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI).	0.9373936667897041
However, a substantial number of patients with AMI who would not have been included in those trials are treated with one of these two therapeutic options.	1.3111610300598247
To describe the proportions, characteristics, and outcome of these patients treated with primary angioplasty or thrombolysis we analyzed the data of the prospective "Maximal Individual Optimized Therapy for Acute Myocardial Infarction" (MITRA) trial.	1.21186969835345
Chronic infectious diseases may run over many months and years, accompanied by only mild clinical signs and often without organ-specific symptoms.	0.9606611090431454
People with any kind of immuno deficiency are more frequently affected by chronic infections.	0.7823082104195723
History, physical examination, laboratory tests, microbiological tests and imaging methods may lead to an exact diagnosis.	1.0678844034122685
The most important differential diagnosis are autoimmune diseases, amyloidosis and malignant lymphoma.	0.9372216674985522
Background: We perform partial sphincterectomy during cataract surgery in cases with very small pupil (< 3 mm).	1.1866262879876386
We assume that the small pupil is mainly due to a fibrosis ring of the sphincter muscle.	0.9343758273089189
Trauma scores in emergency medicine quantitatively characterise the severity of trauma victims' injuries and physiologic derangements.	0.9160387907489971
They are used to detect and assess patients and have applications in guiding patient care and early therapeutic decisions.	0.9844281995116155
In the pre-clinical setting, an effective trauma index meets the following criteria: - It is highly reliable with regard to identifying high- and low-risk patients.	1.130523831106559
- It has high face-validity.	0.9748486322492741
- It has high inter- and intra-rater reliability.	0.9809314758799595
- It is easy to use and allows rapid, accurate measurements.	1.2403873706151967
The most widely accepted injury severity index is probably the Injury Severity Score (ISS).	0.9010814145554276
It is calculated as the sum of the squares of the three most severely injured body regions, and was originally developed as a means to standardise the description of injuries sustained in motor vehicle accidents.	1.0515492229002283
The Trauma Score (TS) represents the gold standard of physiologic scoring of injury severity.	0.868908788233898
It summarises the numerical assessments of the central nervous and cardiopulmonary system functions.	0.8851898075570988
The recently developed Mainz Emergency Evaluation Score (MEES) is based upon numerical specification of the vital signs, including a pain scale, and has been designed as a dynamic score.	1.218478787529519
Nevertheless, limitations of the established trauma score systems have been described.	1.1330813751359041
Mortality and patient outcome do not strictly correlate with injury severity scoring.	0.8260377663561869
In addition, intubated or paralysed patients were excluded from outcome studies since the scoring systems lacked options for evaluation of pathophysiological conditions after therapeutic interventions.	0.9842618051839641
Thus, therapeutic efficacy could hardly be assessed, and subsequent scoring during time periods was impossible.	1.1818587505288982
The accurate definition of comprehensive evaluation of a trauma victim is challenging, for example, "pain" as chosen in the MEES must be regarded as a highly desirable piece of information although its rating may prove difficult, especially when classifying unconscious patients.	1.1462059204800608
Further criticisms of the above-mentioned trauma indices could include omission of the trauma victim's age, gender, pre-injury health status, or the influence of alcohol or additional medication.	0.9802163714727092
Moreover, questioning the interrater reliability of injury severity scoring, a recent study revealed bias in assigning values to trauma patients: trained raters classified injury severity with significantly higher indices than less experienced researchers.	1.040439450448283
If trauma indices in pre-hospital emergency medicine were relied upon as the only means of evaluating a trauma patient and guiding therapeutic approaches, significant numbers of trauma victims requiring major interventions would be missed.	0.988507592556687
Resuscitative treatment regimens must not be based solely upon indices, since, e.g., in states of shock injury scores do not correlate with fluid resuscitative requirements.	1.1462994495957495
Furthermore, a qualitative assignment of single vital-function parameters as crucial indices for a patient's condition never reflects the broad range of a patient's profile.	1.2362246539449828
Many multiple-trauma patients do benefit from controlled ventilation in clinical experience even though pulse oximetry values are within the physiological range, and the administration of analgesics or even pre-hospital anaesthesia has often proved advantageous for trauma patients in the field.	1.1657742810526275
Providing the opportunity of subsequent patient evaluation and the efficacy of acute care, the MEES has been developed as a dynamic scoring system.	1.1405301694478358
This design is extremely desirable and must be regarded as an indispensible criterion for future scoring systems.	0.8180446615845816
In view of the peculiarities of field emergency medicine, pre-hospital indices do have limitations.	0.8467323528856413
The parameters "unknown patient", time pressure, unprecise measurements, lack of diagnostic facilities, incomplete evaluation, and limited statistical power cannot be eliminated.	1.1087154373732324
Accurate prediction of outcome within early time-frames is therefore not possible.	0.8018407401097274
Ossification of the Achilles tendon is the result of a traumatic, hypoxic injury of the tendon.	1.0370714108375263
The usually asymptomatic ossification has a clinical importance only in case of a new trauma.	1.103859050505708
We report about a patient with an isolated fracture of the ossification without an accompanying rupture of the Achilles tendon.	1.1308603030427882
Because of the radiologically "occult" fracture the diagnosis could only be verified by MRI.	0.9108744317202838
With a conservative treatment without resection of the ossification we could reach painless recovery.	0.9510298168158406
Hair problems are attacked at the levels of information supply, trichological competence and evidence based medical treatment.	0.7896862321222111
The alopecias represent a major health care challenge, and the psychological significance of hair loss has only recently found appreciation in the medical community.	1.2121490050734804
They may pose a vexing problem for non-specialized physicians, who tend to trivialize such complaints, although the patient's perception of abnormality determines whether or not advice is sought.	1.0488819664312792
Perception of a hair problem is subject to sociocultural standards; films and advertisements help determine the threshold for "normality" and what is "healthy" and "beautiful", and the media provide an abundance of undiscriminating information with respect to hair care.	1.0972032221888646
Patients with hair problems frequently consult the hairdresser prior to the medical specialist.	0.8628029576032937
Thus additional areas of competence should be incorporated into the hairdresser's training qualifications.	0.7761085494343758
Besides manual, creative and psychological aptitudes, "trichological competence" relating to the recognition of most important hair disorders, recognition of personal limitations and cooperation with the medical specialist are required.	1.0366647395942865
To optimize the interaction between the physician, hairdressers and the media, more effective communication and public activities from the medical profession are desirable, with success depending on full identification of the set goals, qualification and adherance to the standards determined by the medical speciality.	1.0717878330547468
We reexamined biopsy and resection specimens from seven patients with histologically established primary diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) which showed previously undetected adenocarcinomatous differentiation after chemotherapy.	0.9878091309963541
Adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in the same part of the lung as was SCLC before treatment in five cases and in contralateral location in two.	1.2005153542508047
Two tumors showed heterogeneous differentiation with small-cell and adenocarcinomatous components, and five had only adenocarcinoma.	1.1374176277011818
The interval between histological evidence of SCLC and adenocarcinoma was 3 months-5 years.	1.000360611129345
From the specific findings in the respective patients we can offer two possible explanations for changing differentiation in SCLC after chemotherapy: (a) a primarily heterogeneously differentiated tumor with selection of adenocarcinomatous component under chemotherapy, and (b) an independently developed adenocarcinoma after successful chemotherapy of SCLC, as patients with treated SCLC are known to have an increased risk of non-SCLC.	1.1210920567904281
However, therapy-induced alteration of differentiation seems much more unlikely.	1.206903139954234
These findings should be considered in diagnosis and therapy of SCLC to allow early and appropriate reaction to non-SCLC components.	1.03786491263949
Demonstration of BDV-specific serum antibodies, the isolation of BDV from cerebrospinal fluid of neuropsychiatric patients, and the recent demonstration of BDV antigen and BDV-RNA in human brain tissue strongly suggest that BDV can infect humans.	1.0907554004246547
Isolation of BD virus from brain tissue is needed for final proof.	0.7964292891600562
There is still great controversy about the question of whether BDV antigen, BDV-RNA or BDV can be detected in peripheral blood monocytes or not.	1.0335140273232999
Overall, the question of pathogenicity of BDV infection for humans is wide open.	0.9841641765690001
Investigations of human cerebrospinal fluid indicate that BDV might cause human lymphocytic meningoencephalitis and so-called symptomatic psychoses in rare cases.	0.7933983285527162
Seroepidemiological studies suggest a widely non-specific but possibly pathogenic role of BDV in a spectrum of psychiatric disorders.	0.9839592817987308
In a controlled prospective study we compared the efficacy of combined salt water bath and UVA/B phototherapy to a UVA/B mono-phototherapy in patients with subacute atopic dermatitis (AD).	0.9098655704867407
The patients in the balneophototherapy group (n=16) were treated with baths containing 3-5% of the synthetic salt Psori-sal, followed immediately by UVA/B irradiation, while the other treatment arm (n=12) received UVA/B phototherapy alone.	1.184838061264543
After 20 treatments the balneophototherapy group showed a statistically significant (p<=0.0015) reduction of the SCORAD score from 69.5 before to 36.8 after therapy.	1.040721056656576
No statistically significant reduction in the SCORAD score could be observed in the UVA/B phototherapy group (50.6 before to 44.3 after therapy).	1.1156250037937443
The cumulative UVB dose was significantly lower in the balneophototherapy group (0.9 J/cm2) as compared to the UVA/B monotherapy group (2.0 J/cm2).	1.1134215976950652
Balneophototherapy was well tolerated by patients with atopic dermatitis and no side effects were observed.	0.8662190987620929
We conclude that balneophototherapy expands the therapeutic options for patients with subacute atopic dermatitis.	1.0439828904965283
Five percent of all human tumors are found in the head and neck region with an increasing rate.	1.034069202379657
Head and neck tumors are not only a significant problem because of the large number of people affected.	1.3340924934185983
The functional and cosmetic disadvantages and stigmas related to the therapy influence the medical recommendations for each individual patient.	0.9411316136484296
Background and purpose: Only a few clinical reports about the routine use of intravenous rt-PA for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke have been published.	1.2562379896919935
Wether the perfusion of the extracranial parts of the internal carotid artery influences the outcome of the patients is still unknown, because the two major studies about systemic thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA in stroke (ECASS and NINDS) did not formally assess the status of the extracranial vessels.	1.1091385875031705
Introduction: Chronic pain is an individually variable experience, incorporating physical, psychological and social dimensions.	1.2376597828568532
Chronic pain occurs in a broad spectrum of severity; therefore, a grading procedure is of crucial importance in clinical research and in epidemiologic studies.	1.0426705418219941
It is mandatory to differentiate between traumatic and atraumatic instability when treating shoulder instability.	0.8297398924367223
The traumatic instability is characterized by secondary lesions (Bankart lesion, Hill-Sachs lesion, overstretching of the capsule), which are caused at the time of primary dislocation.	1.192241584444597
The quality of the capsule has to be considered in close relationship to the appearance of the Bankart lesion.	1.1521749900891674
The stronger the capsule, the greater the external force has to be in order to surmount the resistance caused by the capsule.	1.0865845444137672
The damage to the glenoid rim makes it possible to draw conclusions about the condition of the capsule.	0.9093130457717079
In cases of atraumatic instability, secondary lesions are normally absent.	0.8360826792520596
These instabilities are often caused by laxity of the capsule.	0.7151546865367834
When stabilizing, a shoulder two criteria have to be taken into consideration: stability and function.	1.014605717239828
Reattachment of the labrum alone will not guarantee stability.	0.821513974039205
Additionally, the overstretched capsule has to be shortened or shifted.	0.8816552351707228
Both criteria are decisive for the success of the stabilizing operation.	0.8156124289532124
In benign goiter, thyroidectomy is only indicated in patients with nodular alterations of the complete thyroid gland.	0.9286107133347429
There is no evidence indicating that total thyroidectomy could improve the postoperative results in patients with Graves' disease.	1.0790434796736443
In Germany, thyroidectomy with cervicocentral lymph node dissection is the standard procedure for all differentiated thyroid carcinomas.	0.9853352668421724
However, there are no data to prove that this approach is superior to less radical procedures.	1.2384620564354898
Avoidance of reoperations and optimal conditions for effective postoperative radioiodine therapy are arguments for this aggressive strategy.	0.8288310351878444
In patients with medullary carcinoma or with detected ret-proto-oncogene mutations, thyroidectomy with cervicocentral lymphadenectomy should be the initial operation.	0.8919196060705002
The cervicolateral and mediastinal compartments should be dissected when clinically obvious lymph node metastases are present in patients with differentiated carcinomas.	0.9091662282292533
In patients with medullary carcinomas, persistently increased calcitonin levels after the initial operation are sufficient indication for this procedure.	1.0020400107627856
Thyroidectomy is an important part of the multimodal approach in patients with anaplastic carcinomas.	0.9071420029542772
The operative technique of thyroidectomy is presented as well as the technique of cervical lymphadenectomy in consideration of the lymphatic drainage of the thyroid gland.	1.2288296975173216
Tyrosinemia type I is an autosomal recessively inherited deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase resulting in accumulation of tyrosin and its degradation products (succinylacetoacetone mainly).	0.8717695580356909
Typical clinical features include liver and kidney failure as well as central nervous system involvement.	1.0117621102312235
There are three main forms of the disease: the acute form with manifestation in newborn infants and the subacute and the chronic form in children older than one year of age.	1.0666556672867116
Experimental data and clinical as well as postmortem experiences have indicated that subdural hematomas are less frequent in acceleration injuries in traffic accidents compared to falls or assaults.	0.892292147628392
The present report demonstrates that this does not hold true in the same way for bridging vein ruptures (one of the predominant causes for subdural bleedings).	1.0636651600689746
Ruptures of these vessels without subdural bleeding (SDB) are only seldom mentioned in the literature.	0.9178592012900346
However, if no SDB is present, no one will look for these structures.	1.3706309900848899
In our institute a systematic analysis of the bridging veins in all cases of lethal blunt head injury is made: prior to the careful morphological preparation we investigate these vessels by radiographic imaging after filling with contrast medium.	0.9744873243290137
6 car passengers (age between 4 and 31 years) which suffered a lethal head injury were examined in the last year.	1.2507875964184207
2 victims had impressed fractures with cerebral compression injuries.	0.7115249698055097
In 1 case the base of the skull was broken and in 3 cases no skull fracture was present; no serious focal brain injury had occured in these 4 cases, but 3 victims had signs of diffuse brain injury.	1.168184498524897
In 5 cases a direct impact of the head against the interior of the car was obvious.	1.1766031683838059
In 5 cases ruptures of serveral bridging veins could be demonstrated.	0.8083389276936574
In one case (survival for 3 days) a minor SDB (20 ml) was present and the ruptures had been closed by thrombosis; another victim died at the scene.	1.2952756259507712
The other 3 victims survived between 4 and 15 hours without developing SDB and without closing of the ruptures by thrombosis.	0.8943106496932358
This combination is surprising and shows that our knowledge concerning the relationship between bridging vein ruptures and SDB is restrictred.	0.8789419641463694
The frequency of bridging vein lesions in severe head injuries is likely underestimated in the clinical as well as in the postmortem literature.	1.0738002077426165
A rapid increase of intracranial pressure after the accident resulting in a collapse of the cerebral circulation is probably responsible for the absence of the SDB in the presented cases.	1.1373967619969074
Implantable hearing aids can form the basis of new surgical techniques for dealing with hearing problems originating in the inner ear, provided they are fully implantable.	1.0191059793681108
Accordingly, a comprehensive, interdisciplinary, combined project was initiated at the ENT clinic of the University of Tübingen which was to conclude with operations to improve hearing via fully implantable hearing aids.	1.0984268554651848
A novel electromechanical transducer for implantable hearing aids based on the piezoelectric principle is described.	0.888074577039967
Unlike the piezoelectric transducers reported so far, this transducer does not rely on the bimorphic principle but on a circle-shaped, heteromorphic combination system consisting of a piezoceramic disc and metal membrane.	0.9062857758190161
The transducer can be hermetically sealed and is designed for implantation into the mastoid.	0.7827765436124409
Transfer of mechanical oscillations to an ossicle in the middle ear is effected by a directly fixed coupling rod or via suitable coupling elements.	0.8948603259247361
The transducer is highly tuned with a resonance frequency at the upper end of the spectral transfer range (greater than 10 kHz).	0.9945980050405949
Below this resonance and down to low frequencies, the frequency response of elongation is smooth with amplitudes of around 20 nm.	1.0183729790648335
At low and middle frequencies of up to 1 kHz, these vibration amplitudes correspond to sound-pressure levels of around 90 dB SPL.	0.9290939620042816
At higher frequencies of up to 10 kHz, the output level increases to about 130 dB SPL.	1.0061479064995305
Nonlinear distortions are also very small at the highest levels (less than 0.1%) throughout the whole transfer range.	1.0160013451779437
Electric power consumption at maximum levels is in the range of a few microwatts and is therefore significantly lower than that of electromagnetic systems.	1.0666306072136298
Particularly, this makes it possible to use the transducer in fully implantable hearing aids for rehabilitation of sensorineural hearing loss.	1.0080110752184428
In craniomaxillofacial traumatology, surgical oncology and craniomaxillofacial reconstruction, a surgeon's aim may interfere with the prechiasmatic visual pathway.	0.9845548665219325
Precise concepts and therapeutic strategies are mandatory to detect and deal with anterior visual pathway disorders.	0.9810598608208693
In order to develop these strategies, knowledge of the pathomechanisms of potential optic nerve trauma, primary radiological investigations, and further diagnostic measures are important.	1.0995164493644367
Due to the difficulties in neuroophthalmological testing of visual pathway functioning in severely injured patients or even during craniomaxillofacial reconstructions, we established flash-evoked visual potentials (VEP) and the electroretinogram (ERG) as reliable electrophysiological methods to gather specific information as to whether the visual pathway function is intact, even if pathological, but still present or absent.	1.1972032045223318
Case reports show that subjectively or objectively confirmed unilateral amaurosis does not neccessarily mean irreversible vision loss.	0.696526636958789
The electrophysiological evaluation together with multiplanar computer tomography (CT) are important for the immediate identification of optic nerve trauma.	1.0368352187083625
The results of this evaluation will provide the diagnostic information on whether surgical intervention and/or conservative therapy is required to prevent secondary optic nerve damage.	1.177590383243069
The conservative therapy of choice for the treatment of traumatic optic nerve lesions is the methylprednisolone-megadosis regimen (30 mg Urbason/kg bodyweight i.v.	1.0301010796671815
and 5.4 mg/kg bodyweight/h i.v.	1.0788196251674342
for the following 47 h).	0.683696449397636
Surgical therapy involves decompression of the orbital compartment in case of retrobulbar hematoma or decompression of the intracanalicular part of the optic nerve in the traumatized optic canal or posterior orbit as confirmed by CT.	0.91715455027169
Prospective analysis of our trauma patients and the international literature on traumatic optic nerve lesions show that the time factor in when to start therapy has been greatly underestimated.	1.1725716825933914
To fulfill modern treatment concepts in craniomaxillofacial surgery, sound diagnostic and therapeutic knowledge on the maintenance of visual pathway function is required.	0.9713280272653219
In the presence of preterm labor, premature rupture of the membranes, and preterm maturation of the cervix, there is an increased risk for premature birth.	1.1671938496958194
There is a combination of endocrine as well as paracrine regulations which are responsible for the events associated with preterm labor, maturation of the cervix, and preterm rupture of the membranes.	1.0713897520374804
Apart from classical hormones, various pro-inflammatory cytokines act as mediators.	0.8549184416172337
At the fetal-maternal interface - which is formed by the placenta with the chorioamnion on the fetal side and the decidua, myometrium, and the cervix on the maternal side - an intense interaction between endocrine and immunological reactions has been observed.	1.2256966758757917
Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a hormone with multiple functions in humans, produced by the pineal gland and stimulated by -adrenergic receptors.	1.1925813011339923
Serum melatonin levels exhibit a circadian rhythm with low levels during the day, rise in the evening and maximum levels at night between 2 and 4 a.m.. Melatonin participates in the regulation of several physiological processes such as seasonal biological rhythm, daily sleep induction, aging and modulation of immunobiological defence reactions.	0.9494943982446677
Furthermore, melatonin has a highly lipophilic molecular structure facilitating penetration of cell membranes and serving as an extra- and intracellular free radical scavenger.	1.0819689315407837
Melatonin seems to quench mainly hydroxyl radicals, the most damaging of all free radicals.	1.0412844469256015
Melatonin may play a role in the etiology and treatment of several dermatoses e.g.	0.9345125272740935
atopic eczema, psoriasis and malignant melanoma.	0.7162474194218674
The influence of melatonin on hair growth is another aspect.	0.830553481289471
Topical application of melatonin inhibits the development of UV-erythema.	0.8490534176953334
Penetration through skin after topical application and oral bioavailability auxit further investigations on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic actions of melatonin.	0.8209540902663454
Lung dust analyses were performed on tumor-free lung tissue from surgical samples of 28 carcinoid tumors.	0.9824177803626061
The measured levels in one surgical sample may easily be correlated with the increased asbestos load of the lung due to the patients' occupation as stone mason.	1.0521035004409227
No evidence supporting the correlation of increased chronic asbestos load of the lungs and the development of typical carcinoid tumors of the lung was found.	1.0163457390836572
Analysis of 147 repeat arthroscopies of the knee performed at the Department of Surgery at the Herz-Jesu Krankenhaus, Fulda, from 1990 to 1995, showed that meniscal lesions were the most common (n = 89, 60.5%).	1.1719595627201793
The majority of meniscal lesions (n = 45, 50.6%) occurred in menisci that had already been partially resected.	1.258492634354729
The most common localization was the posterior third of the medial meniscus in ipsilateral lesions.	1.1270493567994804
Conversely, contralateral meniscal injuries were only documented in 18 cases (20.2%), while de-novo lesions occurred in 29 cases (29.2%).	1.1419103560745227
A coincidence of meniscal injury with first- or second-grade cartilage damage was documented  in 35 patients (39.3%), whereas 54 patients (60.7%) had normal intra-articular cartilage.	1.2892766267989122
Cartilage damage was most frequent in patients who had previously undergone partial meniscectomy.	1.1016406607975704
The most common therapeutic consequences were partial meniscectomy and cartilage-shaving.	0.9757660517334894
Concerning patients' postoperative satisfaction and evaluation of the results by OAK score, the majority of patients attained significant improvement in function (65.2%) and showed good or excellent outcome in the OAK score (88.8%).	1.1490635155496383
Patients without accompanying cartilage damage had better results in comparison to patients with cartilage damage in the affected area (p < 0.05).	0.812876022855154
In conclusion, in patients with positive meniscal signs and a history of previous meniscal surgery, repeat arthroscopy is generally and early indicated and can be recommended as a valid method to assess cartilage damage objectively.	1.1416261915503647
However, patients with cartilage damage do not have the same benefit.	1.2885567567173244
The present study examined the effectiveness of combined dermatological and behavioural medicine therapy on the skin status and disease-specific stress of eighty-six patients with psoriasis and fifty-eight patients with atopic dermatitis who were hospitalized in the PsoriSol Clinic, Hersbruck, Germany.	1.1079723479388361
In addition to receiving instruction about their stain disease, the patients were offered, practice in relaxation techniques, social contacts and scratching control as well as individual psychological counselling.	1.1603327672443091
The clinical change was assessed by PASI and SCORAD, respectively.	0.7246905116912827
The Marburg questionnaire for coping with skin diseases (MHF) and a questionnaire for health-related control attributes (GKÜ-S) served as psychometric measures.	1.088103029589023
Patients showed significant improvement in skin status and psychosocial parameters in pre-post comparison.	0.8321707219726578
Social fears, avoidance and helplessness were reduced by significant improvement of the emotional status in both groups.	0.9042672354111769
Patients with psoriasis also showed an increase in internal control attributes.	0.8979788162864505
Dermatological treatment combined with behavioural medicine therapy can be considered an effective method in patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.	0.9714106639413186
Treatment of chronic cancer pain with strong opioids is indicated in about 60-70 % of patients.	1.137642071431278
Surprisingly, these very potent analgesics are prescribed with great reservations in many countries, including Germany.	1.1291844666712443
The aim of our investigation was to analyse the supply of opioid analgesics to outpatients with cancer pain in the region of Hannover, which has about 1.1 million inhabitants.	1.3695730019440635
In Germany special prescription forms, i. e. triplicate forms, have to be used for the prescription of strong opioids.	0.9591440871783717
At the time when our investigation took place prescriptions for outpatients had to be renewed every 7 days.	0.944299904435546
For two observation periods of 6 months lasting from January to June 1988 and from January to June 1991 all of the opioid prescription forms that had been issued by general practitioners for clients of the AOK Hannover (one of the major medical insurance companies) were evaluated.	1.1326266836666643
The reasons for prescribing opioids were analysed by recording the diagnosis.	0.8969246527285547
The individual treatment period on an outpatient basis during these 6 months was determined, excluding, e. g. days of hospitalization.	1.0365367886198502
During the two observation periods only 16.2 % (1988) and 19.5 % (1991) of the practitioners in the region of Hannover prescribed strong opioids to outpatients.	1.1779078496761433
The majority of the practitioners consisted of general practitioners and specialists in internal medicine.	1.0483682137445842
Although these two groups mainly function as family doctors who are responsible for the basic therapeutical needs of their patients, only 22.6-33.8 % of these doctors prescribed opioids to outpatients.	1.1764296972823989
In two-thirds of the patients, cancer pain was the reason for prescribing the drug.	0.8706726137719959
The total number of patients with a prescription for cancer pain was 164 in 1988 and 196 in 1991.	0.9562471103508831
Altogether 1002 prescription forms in 1988 and 1065 prescription forms in 1991 had been issued for these patients.	0.8072828768675754
Applied to the individual treatment period as an outpatient, only 36.0 % of the patients in 1988 and 32.1 % in 1991 received a regular prescription of strong opioids every 7 days.	1.2806558386603917
The mean time interval between separate prescriptions was 16.8  +/-  25.4 days in 1988 and 19.4  +/-  29.1 days in 1991.	1.2354311692714728
Accordingly, the majority of patients with chronic cancer pain had been supplied with opioids only occasionally.	1.1210918542678117
Our data indicate a significant undertreatment of outpatients suffering from cancer pain.	0.7974922717375384
Taking into account the estimated total number of patients suffering from cancer, only 14.5 % (1988) and 19.0 % (1991) of all outpatients in need of strong opioids were supplied sufficiently with those analgesics.	1.254070460978966
Comparing the results from the observation period in 1988 with the results from 1991 it becomes obvious that the situation has not changed.	1.1277532735457256
There are different reasons for the insufficiency of opioid treatment: many physicians as well as their patients are still afraid of the side effects of strong opioids.	1.0882819974246618
Therefore, it is necessary to improve education concerning this issue.	1.1181325312872845
The legal restrictions on the use of narcotics and their complexity are another important reason for doctors not to prescribe strong opioids.	0.8308310241929774
In 1993 the regulations were simplified; nevertheless, this has not led to a profound change in the attitude of the prescribing practitioners.	1.0967079572279599
Thus, further changes in legislation seem to be necessary so that the requirements for the prescription of strong opioids do not differ from other drugs.	1.1796351324363326
The long-term functional results of acetabular fractures are assessed in terms of the corresponding criteria of Merle-D'Aubigné and Postel (pain, mobility, walking).	0.9343903682962841
Other essential criteria include the quality of reduction and the radiological appearance.	1.0382413041432157
A 53 year old female patient developed a keratoacanthoma, present on the left side of her nose for two months.	1.158497931912976
After repeated unsuccessful trials with cryotherapy, she was treated with intralesional injection of methotrexate performed twice with a weekly internal.	0.9215219801713335
This led to complete resolution within 5 weeks.	0.8408661119135566
Although controlled studies on the effect of methotrexate in keratoacanthoma are not available, the rapid regression and the good cosmetic result suggest that this therapy may play a beneficial role in treating these lesions especially in problem locations.	1.0858642662797144
Between January 1995 and June 1996, 24 inpatients at our hospital (mean age 55.6 years) were treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).	1.108088018598954
Clinical improvement was observed in 80% of the patients, including those without risk factors (NRG, n=16), as well as those with concomitant cardiovascular diseases (RG, n=8).	1.0723458028986195
During a mean period of observation of 224 days after the end of ECT 7 patients (35%) relapsed.	1.1292779683812817
The rate of relapse was higher in RG than in NRG patients (57.1 vs 23.1%).	0.9851394974262049
In all cases ECT was well tolerated; 285 applications of ECT did not result in mortality or persistent morbidity.	0.9301064094117389
However, RG patients may be at increased risk for the development of minor cardiovascular complications, which were noted in three RG patients (37.5%), but only in one patient (6.2%) in the NRG (Fisher's test, P=0.09).	1.3491113138619435
Taken together, our results demonstrate that ECT is a safe treatment regimen for depression even in medically ill patients of old age.	0.997642666213296
On 21.11.1811 the poet Heinrich von Kleist and his companion Henriette Vogel were found dead in a small hollow by the Wannsee.	0.8748078877440484
The autopsy revealed that Kleist was shot in the mouth and Vogel died from a close-contact shot to the chest.	0.8930143154002963
The tragedy, which was reflected in letters and documents ended in a suicide pact.	1.0395723743168743
The conclusions of the pathologists were influenced by current medical opinions which were based on interpretations of the ancient humoral doctrine of Hypocrates.	0.800130606256285
Subjective and objective opinions were mixed together.	0.6399483918135978
Some forensic and historical aspects of this suicide pact are highlighted.	0.7951863119566372
There is no doubt that a single emergency phone number is desirable, but in contrast to other countries, in Germany different emergency phone numbers and dispatching centers exist for the fire brigade (FB), the emergency medical service system (EMS), and the general practitioners' emergency service (GPS).	1.278751405854363
Due to this fact, valuable time is often wasted by connecting or transferring emergency calls from one dispatching center to another.	0.7739334796648717
The purpose of this study was to analyse all calls received by the different dispatching centers in the city and county area of Mainz with respect to total number, fraction of emergency calls, and specificity.	1.0928229638480425
Further, the total number of calls potentially referring to a hypothetic single dispatching center with a general emergency phone number (112) was calculated.	1.1086795572393422
During a 4-month period, all telephone calls were registered and related to day, time, and origin of the call (city or county) and classified as non-urgent or emergency calls, calls appropriate to the dispatching center dialed, emergency calls to be transferred, or unspecific calls.	1.1067844570684653
A total of 80 987 calls were received (city area 84.3%, county area 15.7%), most of them directed to the FB of Mainz (33 086).	1.2008935260515259
The EMS dispatching center received 31 286 calls, the five GPS-centers 15 256 calls; 1359 emergency calls that were directed to the police or FB needed transfer to the EMS.	0.9052716139047167
During weekdays the EMS and FB received the most calls, with a reduced frequency on Saturdays and Sundays (Table 2).	1.0087045792394063
Nevertheless, the highest total numbers of calls were received on Saturdays due to multiple calls directed to the GPS.	0.9750963147724231
The FB had the highest specificity of calls; more than 50% of the calls to the GPS were unspecific (Fig.	1.0193061380177206
Of all calls, 4.37% were classified as emergency calls; two-thirds of these came from the area of Mainz during the daytime.	1.0678584300590686
During off-duty hours of the GPS in the city, 51% of the emergency calls reached the EMS directly; 49% had to be connected by the police or FB.	1.2083381461886902
During duty hours of the GPS, the fraction of calls directed to the EMS decreased significantly to 35%.	0.9800853378072361
During duty hours of the GPS centers in the county area, only 14% of the urgent emergency calls reached the EMS dispatcher directly (Fig.	1.0133781007903409
Compared to the multiple-center mode, a hypothetic single dispatching center for all systems would probably be followed by a slight increase in total number of calls due to the fact that the GPS numbers would be answered 24 h a day, but there would be only minimal differences in the total number received on most days; only on Sundays would a decrease be expected.	1.1133623018636312
The EMS area of Mainz, with a total of 13 different telephone numbers for 7 dispatching centers, can be regarded as typical of the German situation.	1.215287913516699
The high number of emergency calls to be transferred (up to 86% under special circumstances) demonstrated that this weak point in the German EMS system must be eliminated by introducing a single emergency number.	1.040988039595137
This should occur when a Europe-wide three-digit number "112" will be instituted, probably in 1995.	0.9420989944748988
Additionally, the continued existence of 5- or 10-digit telephone numbers for non-urgent calls may be useful for allowing non-verbal differentiation of calls.	1.1176093654101102
In any case, all telephone numbers, including the latter calls, have to enter one dispatching center.	1.2312846302909612
The main advantage of a single dispatching center would be avoidance of the time-consuming transfer of emergency calls from one dispatching center to the other.	1.0109166555377278
In addition to elevated intraocular pressure, a compromised ocular blood supply has been implicated in the pathogenesis of primary open-angle glaucoma (PCOG).	0.971401167662497
The ongoing change of demographic and economic structures does not undermine employment (as many believe), but this change indeed induces problems with the mandatory old-age security system in Germany.	1.1179419617218755
This paper discusses some popular reform proposals and concludes with another proposal which takes into account economic incentives.	0.8192909722177633
Especially the gerontological aim of a longer lifetime employment is adressed.	0.8034459006668996
Epidemiologic data suggest that an underlying genetic disposition can be detected in up to 10 % of all colorectal cancer patients and autosomal dominantly inherited hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is the entity most frequently identified.	1.2388412795184647
It was described first by A. Warthin in 1895 in "Family G" and is characterized by a predisposition to an early onset of colorectal cancer and other intestinal or genitourinary tumors.	1.094170811956216
We report the case of a 61-year-old woman with five different cancers.	0.924533227042158
Although the strict Amsterdam Criteria were not fulfilled, molecular analysis revealed HNPCC; further genetic testing in the family confirmed that the 36-year-old and so far healthy son had inherited the germline mutation of his affected mother.	1.055948521529687
Genetic testing in clinically suspected HNPCC cases is recommended for patients with colorectal cancer meeting the Amsterdam Criteria.	1.0101565559811838
In patients meeting one of Bethesda Criteria 2-7 without meeting the Amsterdam Criteria, germline mutation analysis is recommended only in MSI-positive tumors.	0.9002182761519966
Introduction: The Pura-Vario stent features 2 newly designed "bridging segments" for enhanced longitudinal flexibility, in order to allow easier and safer stent implantation.	0.9736520499128022
The median palatine suture has long been regarded as having the greatest resistance to dilatation of the maxilla.	0.8194034200352398
In 1984 Glassman [3] presented a conservative-surgical method of division of the palatineal suture in which only the lateral and anterior support of the maxilla is debilitated surgically.	0.9969484740730128
An orthodontic apparatus cemented in place preoperatively is already used intraoperatively for dilatation of the maxilla.	0.7803403675021469
In the period from 1991 to 1997, 16 patients with a leptomaxilla and various dysnathic findings have been operated on at our clinic by the method described by Glassman [3].	1.093141040502784
Sometimes the maxilla was dilated intraoperatively using the apparatus cemented in place by the method of Derichsweiler and dilatation was continued postoperatively until the described result was achieved.	0.9908456855228289
After successful dilatation of the maxilla and a stabilizing phase, a mono- or bimaxillary operation was performed.	1.1560105044849112
The use of this method led to the desired result in 15 patients.	1.1185064240677536
Dilatation of the maxilla was objectivized by determining the pre- and postoperative width of the anterior and posterior dental arch using models and X-ray of the occlusal overlay of the maxilla.	1.0827838428238197
In one patient who was operated on at the age of 38 years, a fracture of the alveolar process of the maxilla occurred unilaterally due to the completed ossification of the median palatine suture.	1.2644390025647816
The method of surgically aided dilatation of the maxilla at the level of Le Fort I plane is suitable for patients up to the age of 30.	1.0273749052222891
In older patients, the median palatine suture should be transsected as well.	0.9314235431284078
Osteoarthritis is the most common joint disease.	1.0698078043315256
In addition to known risk factors e.g.	0.7915006652619068
genetics, age and hormonal status it has been suggested that chronic-repetitive micro- and substantial (macro-) injury may play an important pathogenetic role.	1.24871603175161
In a longitudinal case-study we examined Judo-players for clinical and radiological changes of the finger joints over the course of 16 years.	0.9831533486485345
Arteriovenous fistula is a rare complication following vascular trauma.	0.9378220765457443
We report a case of an arteriovenous fistula of the neck after a penetrating injury.	1.1123058401180193
The only presenting symptoms were a thrill and a machinery murmur.	0.7532794539231374
There were no signs of cardiac insufficiency.	0.8387982717912416
Duplex scan and arteriography detected an arteriovenous fistula between the superior thyroid artery and the superior thyroid vein.	0.9514974974527665
Treatment should be carried out as soon as possible, and is then usually simple and successful.	1.148779697281844
Pathogenesis: Arteriosclerosis and Mönckeberg's disease mediasclerosis are vascular diseases associated with calcification of the artery wall.	0.821658194481306
While mediasclerosis in most cases develops in type 2 diabetic patients, arteriosclerosis is the result of a combination of different vascular risk factors.	1.0073852303359934
Möncheberg's mediasclerosis typically involves the tunica media, whereas arteriosclerosis-associated calcifications primarily involve the intima.	0.8931670755257096
The new technique of non-invasive magnetic resonance (MR) sialography was evaluated for normal and various pathologic conditions of the parotid gland.	0.9297339024970205
Ten volunteers and 15 patients with various symptomatic diseases of the parotid gland were tested in the present study.	1.0917364869790458
Diseases included pleomorphic adenoma, cystadenolymphoma, carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma, ductal carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, lymphoepithelial carcinoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, sialolithiasis, sialadenitis, Heerfordt's syndrome and congenital duct ectasies.	0.8748189808316192
In addition to the usually performed T1 and T2 cross-sectional sequences a heavily weighted T2 sequence (TR 3600, TE 800) was performed and allowed depiction of a fluid-filled parotid duct.	1.0586074765869644
Results showed that the main parotid and primary branching ducts were depicted reliably in all normal cases and all patients, except one with sicca syndrome.	0.9875298155414013
Pathological conditions such as duct dilatations, duct strictures, obstructing duct calculus and irregular shapes and courses of the ductal system were demonstrable.	0.7548648347235561
While X-ray sialography obtained a higher resolution, only MR sialography was able to depict dilated ducts proximal from a complete obstruction, as well as all ductal cysts.	0.9835384760112194
Our findings show that MR sialography can be applied successfully to investigations of the parotid gland system.	0.9240804342192247
There have been no contraindications or complications to date because MR sialography is non-invasive.	0.9236629683562319
The technique will also allow the salivary ducts and lesions to be differentiated from the course of the facial nerve.	0.9286750517748926
Substantial improvement in conformal radiotherapy is possible using modulated irradiation fields.	0.7768676590994018
Such modulated fields may be generated even with conventional accelerators by means of individual metal compensators or with the recently available dynamic multileaf collimators (MLC).	0.8552881082241295
For treatment planning a new kind of planning program is required that can calculate the 2 D-intensity matrices for each photon field.	0.9120982735197396
At the German Cancer Research Center (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum) such a program has been developed under the name of "KonRad" (Conformal Radiotherapy).	1.074486560027983
Although it is an independent application, it is proposed for clinical usage to supplement a planning system that is already present.	1.1767128051079028
So-called inverse planning differs from conventional 3 D planning, as the trial-and-error approach for finding good field parameters is nearly completely avoided.	0.9971284457259368
Instead, the radio-oncologist is given the chance directly to specify medically oriented criteria like the prescription dose in the target volume, maximal tolerance dose values for each organ at risk and their weighting factors.	1.0549775114517859
In addition, the so-called DVH optimization allows aimed, partial overdosage, especially in parallelly structured organs in order to obtain better overall planning results.	1.0734305450573267
The Problem Six-year old boy with unilateral Type-II cleftfoot, oligodactyly and clinodactyly of the 2nd toe.	1.027984113523479
The marked splaying of the forefoot not only causes painful pressure points but also problems with fitting of shoes.	0.894487398750307
A child with typical signs of the cat eye-syndrom except the characteristic feature of a cat eye is reported.	0.8587050147209987
In a chromosome analysis (47,xx, + mar de novo) an extrachromosome was detected.	0.8609807603688416
Using fluorescence in situ hybridization the supernumerary marker refered to chromosome 22.	0.7580263282048253
In the literature only a few cases show all the characteristic features of cat eye syndrome.	1.171462343416673
However, there are only two case reports of children without any ocular alterations.	1.3217582380144945
The great variability in the phenotype probably depends on different sizes of the marker chromosome or asymmetric breakpoints on the long arm of chromosome 22.	0.8449844079131223
According to new literature reports there is no correlation between the phenotypic variability and the size of the marker chromosome.	0.9490701550561966
Probably the degree of severity is correlated with the percentage of the patients lymphocytes that contain the extrachromosome.	1.0809359342678686
Introduction: Children with ALL frequently present with skeletal pain at the time of diagnosis.	1.1141477471813073
We retrospectively analyzed the incidence and clinical features of skeletal pain and the correlation between pain and radiographic findings.	1.1246871063714932
Objective: Elevated levels of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) have been reported after cardiac operation, during inflammatory process and cardiac allograft rejection.	1.2285583173251677
Although several groups proved the evidence of a negative inotropic effect, the actual mechanism is not completely understood.	1.088216023407448
Speaking generally it is possible that low molecular weight proteins are capable of altering myocardial contractility on the level of the contractile apparatus.	0.8604678467348115
Therefore this study analyzes whether IL-1 and/or IL-6 influence myocardial contractility on the level of the contractile apparatus.	0.9015646319937355
Methods: During aorto-coronary bypass operation, human muscle fibers were excised (n=32) and skinned using Triton-X-100.	1.1068251929305546
The experimental skinned fiber model excludes membrane-related factors such as receptor activation and provides direct examination of the contractile apparatus itself.	0.8767799264969595
Different concentrations of IL-1 and IL-6 were applied (pIL-1/IL-6 1-2x10-5-10-11M).	0.9027904485416587
Force generation, calcium sensitivity, and velocity of force generation and relaxation were measured.	0.9828089698637571
(Experiments were carried out at optimal length, bath temperature 23 °C, and isometric conditions.)	0.8854833387696192
Results: None of the skinned muscle preparations of the human myocardium showed under the given experimental setup a significant change in contractility and relaxation after exposure to IL-1 and IL-6.	1.0040124317741803
Despite using nonphysiologic concentrations of IL-1 and IL-6 (pIL-1/IL-6 10-5M) no significant effect occurred.	0.9280043585628248
Furthermore no difference in calcium-sensitivity of the contractile proteins following addition of IL-1 and IL-6 could be observed.	1.0001479876899964
Conclusions: Thus, there is no experimental evidence for direct modulation of the contractile apparatus by IL-1 or IL-6.	1.2853315384343402
Given these results it is possible to exclude some potentially negative inotropic cascades that are mediated on the level of the contractile apparatus as the molecular mechanism.	1.0314056537314902
These data show that therapies which support myocardial contractility during sepsis by stimulation of the contractile proteins do not seem to be very promising.	0.9521428236901904
Indications for intercarpal and radiocarpal resectionarthroplasty and fusions are osteoarthritis, KIEHNBÖCK'S disease, rheumatoid arthritis and several posttraumatic disorders of the wrist joint.	0.731919273908067
The resection of carpal bones leads to severe instability patterns of the wrist.	0.8702489679890678
In conclusion we recommend resection-arthroplasty just for treatment of the thumb carpo-metacarpal osteoarthritis.	0.9751100089188847
Implant resection arthroplasty of the lunate and scaphoid or total wrist implants are still causing multiple problems regarding heavy load.	0.9723521881690089
Therefore this implants should be confined to rheumatoid patients.	0.5631227448608215
Of the limited carpal arthrodeses the scaphotrapezium-trapezoid arthrodeses is the most frequent performed procedure.	0.907408261616578
It can be indicated for STT-osteoarthritis, KIEHNBÖCK's disease, scapho-lunate instability and scaphoid pseudarthrosis if other surgical procedures had failed presuming there are no signs of arthrosis in the radiocarpal joint.	0.9483861491683843
Persisting pain especially in heavy work is quite frequent after limited arthrodesis but can be greatly releaved by simultaneous wrist denervation.	0.8245797739586945
In advanced cases of osteoarthritis total wrist arthrodesis is still the best choice for the patient.	1.0809778260134786
Increasing numbers of monitors at the anaesthesiologist's workplace, providing more than 20 different parameters of the patient's condition, have already made it impossible to record all the values in a handwritten form.	1.139236493535804
Consequently, this most common method of record-keeping must be incomplete and inaccurate.	1.0295113085819434
In recent years computerised data-acquisition systems have been introduced into clinical practice in order to produce more reliable records.	1.038945694211
But after a 7-year experience in the use of such a system in cardiac anaesthesia, we have recognised certain problems that remain to be solved before automated record-keeping will achieve wider acceptance.	1.1217396134395783
The first is the handling problem, which was discussed in a previous paper [11].	1.0067707430254553
The second major problem is the appearance of artifacts, caused mainly by mechanical manipulations during the operation.	0.9508241614635553
In this paper, 300 courses of anaesthesia that were recorded on-line during different cardiac surgery procedures were examined and the incidence as well as the kind of artifacts occurring were evaluated.	1.1536974383642251
Algorithms were developed for each haemodynamic parameter to suppress these artifacts automatically by a subsequent analysing process; the efficiency of that "artifact filter" was validated in 35 of the 300 cases.	0.9948889718457463
Based on more than 30,000 values for each parameter, the incidence of artifacts was 3%-7%.	1.3361710354464813
However, only 0.1%-0.5% of the artifacts could not be eliminated by the filter.	1.3454960992925808
The method described here provided acceptable graphic printouts of the most important haemodynamic parameters (Figs.	0.9104984738619252
1b and 2b) and would also be suitable to serve as an input filter for automatically running anaesthesia data-examination processes, which are currently being developed in our clinic.	1.1546356889250364
Extracorporal shock wave application (ESWA) has been used in the treatment of stones located in kidneys, bile, pancreas and the glandula parotis.	0.7059774830682316
In the last 2 years several studies have shown the benefit of the ESWA on the treatment of soft tissue disorders.	0.9431986516145119
The aim of this study was to explore the effect of high energy extracorporal shock waves in patients with painful calcaneus spurs.	0.9769094460778133
83 patients who underwent medicophysical treatment without benefit were treated with 3000 impulses of 0,30 mJ/mm2.	0.942395840793881
Follow-ups after 12 weeks and 12 months showed that 51 of 83 patients became pain-free and 20 patients improved from the treatment.	1.143904555785224
The results are showing the benefit of the high energy extracorporal shock wave application in the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis.	1.3262055215847641
In developed countries, medical conditions, rather than lack of food, are the main contributors to malnutrition.	1.0641372841091723
Undernutrition is especially common in older persons, occuring in 5-12 % of community-dwelling older persons, in 30-61 % of hospitalized older persons, and in 40-85 % of persons in long-term care institutions.	1.4241325083918424
The multi-factorial nature of undernutrition in the elderly forces a structured differential diagnostic approach to determine underlying causes.	1.00091350677443
Heightened physician awareness of nutritional problems and prompt risk assessment is imperative to prevent the sequalae of undernutrition.	0.879360226278889
This structured approach to the differential diagnosis is essential to evaluate potentially reversible causes of malnutrition.	1.1399478288274931
The number of surgical procedures performed as day surgery has significantly increased in recent years.	0.9880092149116201
Therefore, a safe and short postoperative recovery period has become increasingly important.	1.2349043275614575
The aim of the present study was to investigate perioperative cognitive and physiological function after oral premedication with low-dose midazolam (3.75 mg), especially during the postoperative period.	1.3561477352677571
Heart failure may be defined as a reduced physical per-formance frequently caused by a defect in myocardial contraction.	0.9947281302856293
According to the New York Heart Association, the severity of heart failure is classified into four grades (NYHA I-IV).	1.0788601282101111
Predominantly underlying causes are coronary artery disease, hypertension, cardiomyopathies and valvular heart diseases.	0.7512990267406219
Psychic disorders were studied with a naturalistic design in 125 consecutive patients of a medical-geriatric department in a general hospital.	1.0581545205391631
Based on the clinical examination and the values of the Mini-Mental-State-Examination (2), 51 patients were classified as unable for diagnostic procedures concerning psychic state.	1.1342415799902044
The other 74 patients underwent these diagnostic procedures including clinical investigation and three screening-scales (Geriatric Depression Scale (11); Hospital Anxiety and Depression-Scale (4)).	0.9771258124763047
If these examinations led to the suspicion that a patient suffered from a psychic disorder, an interview was performed by a psychotherapist with experience in gerontopsychosomatic treatment and information was collected from the medical and nursing staff.	1.162938643002597
Dementia was detected or excluded by neuropsychological tests.	0.6930234261518243
Psychic disorders were found in 41 patients, mostly adaptation disorders and depressions, the disorder was estimated to be relevant for the whole hospital therapy.	1.1853018480324717
The screening instruments turned out to be reliable, so they can be recommended for further use.	1.1754858749150363
Difficult to answer remains the question, how the treatment of the psychic disorders - in our sample necessary for each 5th to 6th patient - can be implemented in a medical-geriatric department.	1.279590717395821
Based on the "Trauma Registry" of the German Society of Trauma Surgery, an interclinical quality management (QM) system was implemented.	1.237616225316556
The principles of the QM system as well as the differences in the quality of outcome and treatment are presented.	1.1850159666396902
The analysis uses the data on 2,069 severely injured (ISS = 22  +/-  14) patients from 20 hospitals collected prospectively and anonymously between 2/93 and 12/97.	1.1142980791173107
Outcome quality was analyzed by the TRISS method and Z-statistics.	0.8251653852910585
The Z-value of the whole series was -0.24.	1.1096023278033889
There were three hospitals with more than 150 patients that had a Ps value calculated by the TRISS method.	0.9861472478150104
Clinic A had a good (-2.49), clinic B an average (-0.3) and clinic C (3.62) an adverse Z-value.	1.4136689622868053
The assessment of treatment quality was performed by criteria concerning both preclinical and acute clinical phases.	1.012810600112326
Clinic C had a prolonged preclinical treatment time (90 min vs 62 min in clinic A) for severely injured (ISS > 15) patients.	1.0674783256571823
At the same time, the preclinical intubation rate for severe thoracic trauma (AIS > 3) was lower (44 %) in clinic C than in A (62 %).	1.1888573427355411
With 14 min clinic A had the shortest time until basic radiological and ultrasound diagnostics were completed (X-rays of chest and pelvis and abdominal ultrasound) in cases of severe blunt trauma (ISS > 15), compared to 54 min in clinic B or 31 min in clinic C. Also, cranial computed tomography for severe traumatic brain injury (GCS < 9) was applied significantly faster in clinic A (after 36 min) than in clinic C (after 62 min).	1.2394538111094737
Delayed diagnoses were defined as the difference between the ISS at discharge and the ISS at completion of diagnostics in the emergency department; this criterion was met best by clinic A with an ISS difference of two patients compared to five in clinic B and four in clinic C.	1.0893801621522712
For invasive catheter procedures both ionic and nonionic contrast media (CM) with excellent tolerability are available.	0.9538021922027831
The governing practical factors for CM are X-ray opacity and biocompatibility.	0.8143653872326405
Tolerability of a contrast medium is governed among its physical properties by its viscosity, osmolality, and ionic concentration.	0.982283405174342
In Germany the nonionic CM are currently preferred.	0.7967234788015038
Because of its low thrombotic complications, the ionic CM Ioxaglat is an important alternative in high risk interventions.	1.1133261844115947
In patients with known CM incompatibility, the prophylactic application of H1-receptor antagonists and corticosteroids allows catheterization safely without complications.	1.0000317343135217
In impaired renal function, hydration is the most effective prophylactic measure to be taken.	1.119541159575467
Background: In the present study we evaluated the influence of topical miotics on intraocular pressure and the blood-aqueous barrier after uncomplicated phacoemulsification and PC-IOL implantation.	1.1303817808281198
A judgement on the patient's quality of life cannot be based solely on the information about the clinical severity of a disease.	1.1068060498163141
Very often there is no correlation between these parameters.	0.9024953549099752
It is necessary to assess the quality of life by a health status question-naire since non-life threatening diseases common in dermatology influence the quality of life very much.	0.9891971957601182
The most frequently used questionnaires are the SF-36 and the Nottingham Health Profile.	0.913785994911516
However, these forms do not evaluate all dermatologic patients adequately.	1.1424179570268
Therefore specific tools such as the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index) and Skindex have been established for dermatology.	1.0347178798585863
Further disease-specific questionnaires have been created to mea-sure time related changes in dermatological patients.	0.87038802879782
We surgically treated twenty patients with axillary hyperhidrosis by liposuction using tumescent regional anesthesia.	0.7544096201640415
After a description of the surgical technique results are presented.	1.061138049233955
Except for trivial hematomas, no complications were seen.	0.9550866028593774
Every patient noted a significant reduction of sweat gland activity in the follow up period.	0.9582666845428092
Long-term results remain to be seen.	1.1340449567427853
The value of cytogenetics performed simultaneously with histopathology was evaluated in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).	0.8771710437048089
Clonal karyotype changes of the bone marrow cells supporting the histological diagnosis were found in 38/69 cases (55 %).	1.060133586174088
The chromosome aberrations, especially complex changes, were significantly correlated to distinct histopathological findings such as atypias of the haematopoietic cell lines and myelosclerosis.	1.1101149065116518
Complex karyotype changes were further associated with short survival of the MDS patients.	0.8522479504081409
Our results demonstrate that cytogenetic analyses are helpful in supplementing the histopathological diagnoses.	0.6851876366775608
Recent developments in molecular cytogenetics even allow the detection of chromosomal aberrations in non-dividing cells from cytological preparations or tissue sections which may become available for routine diagnosis.	0.9362047918015249
In the course of 1 year, Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, which may lead to pseudomembranous colitis and therefore may be very harmful in frail elderly people, was diagnosed in six patients of a geriatric clinic.	1.0898827861492058
The disease is associated with antibiotic therapy, due to an overgrowth of the intestinal flora with Clostridium difficile.	1.0070836175064788
Symptoms varied from a state of asymptomatic carriage or benign diarrhea to acute stages of the disease with severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever and acute phase response.	1.0597554906214273
Diagnosis of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea was established when, in addition to typical clinical symptoms, a toxin-positive stool specimen was found.	1.0112149905886236
Oral vancomycin was effective in all cases, leading to a stop in the diarrhea and an amelioration of systemic inflammatory parameters.	0.9306469056528915
According to recent results, in order to prevent the induction of vancomycin-resistance and in view of higher treatment costs, metronidazole is considered as the drug of choice in mildly and moderately ill patients.	1.0719935439654131
This report analyzes 46 cases of personnel-to-patient transmissions of hepatitis B (HB), hepatitis C (HC) and HIV in health care settings.	1.0141087987767794
Similar circumstances were found for transmission of HB (40 cases, 404 infected patients), HC (4 cases, 224 infected patients) and HIV (2 cases, 7 infected patients).	1.3325268752186752
Cases with the highest number of transmissions (one anesthesiologist with 217 HC transmissions, and one EEG technologist with 75 HB transmissions) were attributed to poor infection control practices.	1.1364049228899387
As long as infected health care workers (HCW) adhere to general infection control measures, a risk for transmission to patients exists only from infected surgeons who perform'xposure-prone invasive procedures'.	0.9010398911545904
Whether changes in duties of infected HCW are necessary should be decided on an individual basis.	0.8262488235775022
Often, the infected personnel were assumed to have acquired the disease occupationally.	0.9557983083225134
Medical practices and devices bearing a risk of infection should constantly be reviewed with regard to risk for patients and personnel.	1.1098872876796957
The healthy newborn infant also has the right to optimal monitoring in order to detect any disturbance in postnatal adaptation as early as possible.	0.9222112876317494
The introduction of painless, simple, and yet reliable methods, e.g., pulse oximetry and transcutaneous bilirubin screening, has considerably improved the situation for obstetricians and midwives.	1.0754663998946876
Injuries of the spine in children rarely occur.	1.0376647680685889
They amount to about 0.2 % of all fractures and dislocation and to 1.5 to 3 % of all lesions of the spine.	1.5495733011138948
The younger an injured child is, the more likely it has sustained a lesion of the upper cervical spine.	1.1417411144599205
This spinal segment in comparison to adults is concerned more often and accounts for 50 % of all C-spine injuries.	1.1713032837192026
Important differences between the adult spine and the spine in the child disappear with the age of 10 years.	1.101688220229404
Later diagnostics, classification and treatment correspond widely with the principles valid in adults.	0.8793547725438523
The knowledge of the normal shape and development of the spine are crucial in avoiding misinterpretations of X-ray films.	1.0937792809381344
Typical examples include the confusion of synchondrosis with fractures or of subluxations of the atlas and the C2/C3 segment with "true" instabilities.	0.9108821052301919
Relevant lesions always are accompanied by clear clinical symptoms.	0.6029628977171168
Specific injuries of the growing axial skeleton are lesions of the cartilaginous endplates and "fractures" of the synchondrosis.	1.1583397444376273
Although a variety of histologic entities were described, primary tumors of the trachea are rare findings.	1.1020645032092937
Over a period of 20 years, 30 patients underwent 31 tracheal resections in two hospitals for thoracic surgery.	0.8898480274492085
Among them 4 patients had thyroid carcinoma involving the trachea.	0.7391305642372483
In these patients a strumectomy combined with tracheal resection was performed.	0.863863220476227
One re-operation for erosion bleeding of the innominate artery on the 8th postoperative day was successfully performed.	0.8460980220704108
All patients showed excellent long-term survival.	1.1439289993175268
Principles, methods and results of percutaneous therapy in acute and chronic vascular alterations of the subclavian artery and its branches.	1.015749166089439
Speculations concerning a possible association between temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) and ear symptoms of otalgia and tinnitus have been made in the dental and medical literature for a long time.	1.0060241021546175
Current understanding of this association is reviewed.	0.6211002377173012
An analysis of relevant studies published between 1947 and 1996 shows that a relatively high percentage of TMD patients reported the presence of ear pain and noise.	0.9614273386556731
However, a cause-effect relationship has not been established to date.	1.3304878495791006
Theories that try to explain the concurrence of TMD symptoms and ear symptoms (particularly tinnitus) by a common underlying cause remain speculative.	0.991731940998494
It has to be taken into consideration that due to their high prevalence, TMDs and ear symptoms in a given patient may be present by chance alone.	0.9590983288292391
A methodological weakness of most of the studies available is the fact that control groups were not considered.	1.0036436075666453
Owing to the lack of prospective, controlled, and randomized studies, statements regarding the effectiveness of certain dental measures for the treatment of otalgia and tinnitus in TMD patients are not well supported.	1.0255143477854147
Our report describes a 46-year-old woman with self-inflicted oedema of the left leg and the left arm.	1.1134740298094103
She induced leg oedema by an elastic bandage tourniquet and arm oedema by holding her arm dependent and immobile.	0.7876711112825249
A preexisting disorder of the affected leg (postthrombotic syndrome) and of the affected arm (hypoesthesia subsequent to surgical injury of the plexus brachialis) delayed the diagnostic proceedings.	1.0960437010670883
Our case report shows that: -  Confirmed presence of organic disease does not exclude limb oedema of self-inflicted origin.	1.157994659484144
-  Oedema resulting from a tourniquet and "hysterical oedema" can be developed by one and the same patient.	1.3227947507201068
-  Effective care of such patients is only possible if dermatologist and psychiatrist work together all the time (liaison psychiatry).	1.089529632188994
Purpose: This study was conducted to control improvement in the high preoperative prevalence of TMJ symptoms in patients treated by long-term orthodontic therapy for class II malocclusion.	1.3757450106404867
Patients and methods: A total of 57 patients were examined at least 8 years after surgery, 37 having received orthodontic treatment and orthognathic surgery and 20 surgery but without orthodontic treatment.	1.0440100033195643
Myofunctional, disk and condylar symptoms were recorded according to the Krough-Poulsen scheme.	0.841199604014248
Results: Both groups showed a normal maximal interincisal distance.	1.189678213896068
The deviation during the opening movement was mainly sigmoidal in the group with orthodontic treatment and terminal in the other group.	1.0851406043019505
Muscular pain predominated in the group without orthodontic treatment.	0.8765474256099937
Clicking sounds of the TMJ were registered in 70% of both groups.	1.165624367093752
Occlusal interference and a higher interocclusal distance when speaking were found more often in patients without orthodontic treatment.	1.052913395595369
Preoperatively, clicking and crepitation sounds had been recorded in 60% of both patients groups.	1.1119700790269875
Conclusion: In conclusion, a high postoperative prevalence of TMJ dysfunction symptoms was found in patients with class II malocclusion 8-10 years after orthognathic surgery with or without orthodontic treatment.	1.3203677996684038
Both groups often exhibited TMJ clicking and crepitation sounds, whereas the patients that had not received orthodontic treatment had a higher prevalence of occlusal interference and muscular pain.	1.0414330756113879
The synthesis of pS 2 protein is induced through estrogen-dependent transcription of the pS 2 gene.	0.8307813265909193
The presence of the pS 2 protein in breast cancer is thought to be as valuable as receptor status, or even more so, in predicting the response to hormonal therapy.	1.1635172072353088
Furthermore, pS 2 appears to be a prognostic factor for primary breast cancer.	1.2878587530231218
In 162 cases of primary breast cancer, pS 2 was tested by immunohistochemical procedures on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues.	0.8559517225589006
Staining was evaluated semiquantitatively using an immunoreactive score (IRS).	0.7491599172325342
The concentrations of pS 2 in tumor cytosol were determined using an immunoradiometric assay.	0.8855291009666739
Positive staining for pS 2 (IRS >= 2) was seen in 27 % of the tumors.	1.339245068729441
Comparison of immunohistochemical and biochemical detection (26 % of tumors had pS 2 cytosol concentrations above the cut-off value of 26 ng/mg cell protein) revealed an 81 % concordance rate (r = 0.76; P < 0.0001).	1.0823160455442118
Univariate analysis showed no significant correlation of immunohistochemical pS 2 detection and age or menopausal status of patients, tumor size, tumor grade or nodal status.	1.0994959905582258
However, the immunohistochemical pS 2 status correlated significantly with the immunohistochemical detection of the estrogen (ER; P < 0.001) and progesterone receptor status (PR; P < 0.0001).	0.9794115720176458
pS 2-positive tumors were ER-positive in 66 % of cases and PR-positive in 73 %; 89 % of pS 2-positive tumors were positive for ER and/or PR.	1.2241177610604423
The incidence of immunohistochemical pS 2 detection was 41 % in the group of steroid receptor positive carcinomas (ER- and/or PR-positive) in contrast to 7 % in steroid receptor negative tumors (ER- and PR-negative).	1.2107682054392699
Patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass grafting may develop acute myocardial infarction late after surgery.	1.0794862757945938
It is not exactly known in these patients whether acute infarction is predominantly caused by occlusion of bypass or native vessels.	1.0319811828314556
Also, there is no systematic and prospective data available with respect to an invasive, revascularizing therapeutic approach.	0.9522337466216887
Therefore, acute coronary angiograms were obtained in 21 consecutive patients with acute infarctions and remote bypass grafting to elucidate mechanisms causing myocardial infarction in these patients, and to assess results of catheter-based recanalization.	1.361936083886894
We report the clinical and laboratory results of a family where one boy and one girl presented with a clinical picture resembling the X-linked agammaglobulinemia known as Bruton's disease.	1.279142431166093
Both children showed severe bacterial infections starting at the age of around 6 months, a lack of all immunoglobulin classes and absence of mature B-cells in the peripheral blood.	0.9931031084430754
With respect to reports from the literature these results are yet another indicator for the existence of an autosomal-recessiv disorder with the same clinical make-up as Bruton's disease.	0.9924177556148536
A deletion on chromosome 14 leading to the disorder was identified.	0.8766986393033949
Conservative treatment of genuine stress urinary incontinence in females gained more and more interest.	0.8183344234722871
The use of mini-devices is one of the newly developed therapeutical options however, its clinical relevance and longterm-results are still under debate.	1.232756641803206
This review article gives a critical evaluation of the available urethral plugs and regulators and new developments as well according to the longterm-follow-up studies in the literature and own experience with those devices.	1.2295364658490646
The continence rates that can be obtained with the different plugs or regulators are dependent upon the degree of stress incontinence, ability to insert the plug and compliance of the patient.	0.9816935173190421
Reported longterm results vary between 48 % and 100 %.	1.2365454314213422
The most frequent side effects are urinary infection, haematuria and/or handling problems with the devices.	1.0368024901568156
According to the published material it is impossible to give therapeutical standards for treatment of female stress urinary incontinence with urethral mini-devices.	0.9288479030709051
Although proper Patient selection might give excellent longterm-results in patient continence rates.	0.8161558758580932
Background: In contrast to the correction of simple myopia there is no widely accepted technique for the correction of myopic astigmatism.	1.148529265346031
Currently two techniques are available: the photoastigmatic refractive keratectomy (PARK) and the combination of arcuate keratotomies with standard PRK (PRK-T).	1.1318988295377572
Although there are randomized data for CABG vs. medical therapy and CABG vs. PTCA in primary therapy of CAD, there is few evidence on the appropriate therapy of recurrent angina after prior CABG.	1.0918325055468994
We analyzed data from 1265 consecutive patients (PTS.)	0.9188158023509547
presenting for recurrent angina after previous CABG who required either re-CABG (n=67), PTCA (n=768) or medical therapy alone (medRx) (n=430) at our institution during 1986 through 1996.	1.1621949627352093
Outcome after index therapy is monitored during 45  +/-  34 months.	0.9697078292096448
The 3 therapeutic groups were similar with respect to gender (84 % male), age at therapy (60 years), prevalence of diabetes (22 %), and time to first ischemic event after primary CABG (37 months).	1.2684662393366941
Actuarial survival was significantly higher in the PTCA-group at 1, 5 and 10 years after therapy of recurrent angina, despite the freedom from subsequent re-intervention was significantly lower (1-year-survival 95 % [37 %] vs. 95 % [3] medRx vs. 79 % [4 %] re-CABG, 5-year-survival 87 % [57 %] vs 78 % [17 %] medRx vs. 50 % [4 %] re-CABG and 10-year-survival 72 % [65 %] vs. 63 % [31 %] medRx vs. 50 % [15 %] re-CABG resp., p < 0.0001, [numbers in brackets represent corresponding values for incidence of re-intervention, p < 0.0001]).	1.359428045400521
These findings were similar after adjustment for different baseline characteristics.	0.8958057574516919
Due to advances in surgical methods, such as miniplate and lag screw osteosynthesis, there is current discussion about the adequate therapy of condylar fractures.	1.0060493474399803
Regarding the insufficient outcome of conservative treatment confirmed by refined methods of functional diagnosis, there is a trend towards surgical therapy, at least in cases of condylar displacement out of the fossa.	1.0756345614656282
This trend was also prompted when surgeons learned that the condyle determines local growth but does not serve as a growth center of the mandible.	0.95528479187676
Along with increased interest in temporomandibular function and surgical therapy of internal disorders, surgical therapy of traumatic soft tissue lesions was emphasized.	1.0207025109872672
This consequently led to surgical restoration of intraarticular fractures.	0.7056607516014889
Conservative treatment will nonetheless be sufficient in cases of minor displacement due to a higher ability of remodeling, even more so in children.	1.1347352937863895
A case of a 37-year-old woman with symmetrical bilateral apocrine hidrocystomas at the lateral margins of the eyelids is presented.	1.0926946735167722
The symmetrical, simultaneous and bilateral appearance of the lesions, the lack of association with other abnormalities and the absence of the lesion in the family history make this case remarkable.	1.1675642404809004
The situation of intensive care units (ICU) in Germany was analyzed by a national survey.	1.2507470193943522
Questionnaires consisting of multiple-choice and short-answer questions were sent to ICUs of university hosptitals, hospitals with >1000 beds, 500-1000 beds, and hospitals with <500 beds separately with regard to the different disciplines (anesthesia ICUs, surgical ICUs, cardiac surgical ICUs, neurosurgical ICUs, neurological ICUs, mixed-surgical ICUs, internal ICUs, interdiscipline ICUs).	1.1026936112744434
The personality organisation and the process of therapy of drug-addicted patients are examined by the comparative analysis of 15 single cases.	0.9926813993511927
The antisocial tendency is emphasised as the main clinical feature.	0.8849289116821176
It is related to specific genetic traumata and the externalisation of parts of the superego.	0.7470010287902296
During the therapeutical process, the antisocial tendency destroys the therapeutical relation.	0.9515869148394437
If it is possible to continue therapy beyond this point, the patients can now enter into a process, in which new identifications and the integration of parts of the superego are involved.	1.2232985124675249
Approaching the end of the therapy, patients, again, tend to destroy the results of therapy if one does not consider specific problems of the separation process.	1.1872249938864534
Objective: The Uppsala-definition of leukoplakia has recently redefined oral leukoplakia.	0.8567784468654117
Based on this definition, the aim of our study was to reevaluate the prevalence of oral leukoplakia in patients with histologically proven primary oral cancer.	1.012241139530169
Design: A total of 101 inpatients in four tumor centers in Berlin were interviewed and clinically examined just prior to surgery of an oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).	0.9706080086309068
Results: The prevalence of leukoplakia immediately adjacent to the carcinoma was 15.8%.	1.0139492183243994
Additional leukoplakias without relation to the carcinoma were found in 4% of the patients.	1.0772501368085747
There were no significant differences in age- or sex-distribution, history of tobacco habits or diet  between patients with or without leukoplakia.	1.1079294169982175
T1 carcinomas were found in 62.5% of patients with, and 24.4% of patients without associated leukoplakia, whereas a balanced distribution was found for the pre-operative staging of the tumor.	1.2677016171088986
Conclusions: The prevalence of oral leukoplakia in patients with OSCC was low, compared to retrospective studies.	0.8519598605233792
The presence or absence of leukoplakia indicated no influence on the prognosis of the tumor, except of tumor size.	0.972971031969276
The results emphasize that most OSCC develop from healthy appearing oral mucosa.	0.7117383660394704
Cutaneous angiosarcomas mainly arise on the scalp and face of older patients.	0.8522046937955441
They present with reddish nodules or plaques and tend to bleed and ulcerate.	0.6781987716822707
Angiosarcomas show an aggressive and recurrent course and have a high potential for metastasis.	1.0730500095383357
We report on a 48-year-old patient with unilateral eyelid edema as the first manifestation of an angiosarcoma.	1.1257091529393901
The clinical presentation, the history of contact allergy, the presence of antinuclear antibodies, and abnormal thyroid function tests favoured a non-neoplastic disease.	1.152551724143947
However, multiple biopsies confirmed the diagnosis of a highly differentiated angiosarcoma.	1.5433782877465185
Staging of the patient revealed no metastasis.	1.3259006324003484
After radical surgery including orbital exenteration and postoperative radiation therapy, no recurrence was observed with a follow up of 26 months.	1.0729507467264996
This case underlines the importance of including angiosarcoma in the differential diagnosis of unilateral eyelid edema.	0.6966042479936124
The Marburg Cardiomyopathy Study (MACAS) is a prospective observational study designed to determine the value of the following potential non-invasive arrhythmia risk predictors in more than 200 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) over a 5-year-follow-up period: New York Heart Association functional class, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and ejection fraction, left bundle branch block and atrial fibrillation on ECG, QTc and JTc-dispersion on 12-lead ECG, abnormal time-domain analysis and spectral turbulence analysis of the signal-averaged ECG, ventricular arrhythmias and heart-rate variability on 24-hour Holter ECG, baroreflex sensitivity, and microvolt T wave alternans during exercise.	1.1006458411094615
Abstract   The observation of extremely variable clinical courses for patients with renal cell carcinomas of an identical pathological stage as well as a comparable histological differentiation resp.	1.2265749555892027
growth pattern strongly indicates the existence of tumors harboring different biological aggressiveness.	0.7152832492824892
Currently available histopathological classification systems do not predict the biological behaviour of renal cell cancer as sufficiently as the establishment of a therapeutical strategy adjusted to the individual patient would require.	1.0759890884057797
The need for a more refined characterization of the biological potential of the indidual tumor results from the introduction of modified operative strategies as organ-preserving surgery, for example, as well as from the recently suggested application of an adjuvant systemic therapy adapted to the individual risk for tumor recurrence resp.	1.0838149027680914
the development of progressive disease.	0.7122513197707615
Therefore, the clinically orientated basic scientist and the basic scientifically orientated clinician intensively try to determine prognostically important biological variables which would allow to better predict the biological aggressiveness of a single tumor in addition to "classical" prognostic parameters (T-stage, histological grading, growth patterns).	1.1307003772490025
In this context, several biological parameters including the identification of alterations on the DNA-, RNA- and protein level have been discussed as possible biological prognostic markers for renal cell cancer.	1.1596248468797488
The present review tries to reflect currently available biological characteristics of RCC which might gain clinical importance with regard to an individualized therapy in the near future.	0.915681700517818
Until now reports of factitious disease have not been found in the ENT literature.	1.067100347537964
In contrast, the dermatologic literature estimates an incidence from 0.01 to 0.26%.	1.1803841996451243
In order to achieve effective treatment for these patients, knowledge of the characteristic symptoms is fundamental.	0.9870084694291128
The present paper describes the variety of disease possible, using three cases treated between 1992 and 1994 in the ENT Department of Cologne.	1.0470223029021954
According to the literature, females are involved in a ratio of 9:1, with the majority working in medically related professions.	1.1280236798567487
Depression and anorexia are typical symptoms.	0.5736788620820805
When a factitious disease is suspected, psychiatric consultation is essential.	0.8871658236570552
Confrontation of a suspect patient by the otolaryngologist is not often considered because several reports quote suicidal behavior in up to 25% of self-manipulating patients and tendencies to refuse to follow psychiatric treatment are considerable.	0.9866197568099313
Numerous different diseases lead to scarring alopecia with irreversible follicular destruction as a common ending.	0.871280131386675
Current classifications are based on clinical, histopathological or prognostic parameters, as well as on pathogenetic criteria which allow only a rough assessment because the precise mechanisms leading to scarring alopecia are still unknown.	0.8753330318318089
Inadequacies of the established classifications are obvious when regarding special forms of scarring alopecia like lichen planopilaris or pseudopelade Brocq.	0.8129333377400172
In order to develop more satisfying classifications, recent insights into biology and pathology of the hair follicle and follicular cycling have to be considered.	1.0034508552379142
The most important structures for the survival of the hair follicle are the epithelial stem cells which reside in the follicular bulge and the fibroblasts of the dermal papilla including the molecular communication between these two cell populations.	1.0663454911865422
Research in the field of scarring alopecia should aim at defining the pathological processes on any of the above mentioned levels which will lead to an irreversible damage of the hair follicle thus allowing the development of new therapeutic agents.	1.0932631251847642
Rheumatoid neutrophilic dermatitis is a rare dermatologic disorder seen in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis.	1.0500180499007754
Clinically firm erythematous 3-5 mm papules are found mainly on the arms, the hips and the proximal thighs.	1.1416125753703192
The lesions may be pruritic leading to excoriations and crusts.	0.660597322627077
Histology reveals a dense dermal infiltrate with neutrophilic granulocytes, while leukocytoclasia may be seen, vasculitits is not observed.	0.8994671107279805
This overview of rheumatoid neutrophilic dermatitis may help remind the practioner to include this uncommon disorder in the differential diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis-related dermatoses.	0.9192532175239869
Background: The rehabilitation of low vision patients is of increasing importance since the number of these patients has grown rapidly.	1.1665924597124249
We wanted to evaluate the actual spectrum of patients concerning age and diagnoses and the appropriate low vision aids (LVA) in 1 year.	1.0900895392512688
It is generally accepted that most inguinal hernias should be operated electively.	0.7652485472543724
This study presents a risk calculation challenging this view.	0.7091312539843029
Three strategies are presented: prophylactic indication on principle (A), elective operation in every second case (B), and operation in case of strangulation only (C).	1.058379322159013
On the basis of available epidemiological data it is calculated that, for the male German population aged 65 years and over 69 954 (A), 36 292 (B), and 2630 (C) inguinal hernia repairs would be necessary annually; 167 (A), 145 (B) and 123 (C) perioperative deaths would occur, connected with 1702 (A), 1373 (B) and 1048 (C) years of life lost, respectively.	1.0584339225402393
Thus, operation of every inguinal hernia would result in a (small) reduction of life expectancy.	1.2694069224423377
These data provide evidence that in elderly patients the indication for operative treatment of inguinal hernias should depend upon symptoms and suffering.	0.9804220952404554
There is no reason to operate on asymptomatic patients because of a presumed risk of strangulation.	1.008140373042994
Since first described by Kibler (1955) hyperalgetic areas of the skin in company with arthropathy or diseases of internal organs are known to be a useful sign to define the affected segment.	1.153064279708186
While seldom utilized by physicians, physiotherapists frequently make use of these special findings concerning the skin as a common part of their daily work.	1.0560282119973905
A certain problem exists in ranging correctly the corresponding segment of the spine, this mostly caused by the inaccurate idea of anatomical facts.	0.9450448623022217
The actual as well as the former literature in this field shows very different views and opinions, all of them rather in contrast to the real anatomical findings.	1.3320019293378094
In the following the topographic-anatomic conditions are presented of which exact knowledge is necessary to evaluate the palpation's result "Kibler's plica positive" relative to its diagnostic valence.	1.0455330083390413
Aim of the study and methods: In the present study the correlation between ischemia induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias and a dynamic behavior of ventricular late potentials was investigated.	1.25226669262447
In 16 patients with significant coronary artery disease and survived sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia an electrophysiologic study (EPS) was performed.	0.9823663605767966
Before EPS (t1), at every stimulation interval and after induction of a ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) the lactate concentration was measured in arterial blood and in the coronary sinus for calculation of the myocardial lactate extraction.	1.2608268989823643
Furthermore, before investigation, after induction of a VT/VF and after a 10 minute recovery phase an analysis of the signal averaged ECG was performed.	1.2115613969252776
Nine patients showed a so-called "lactate reversal", i.e., an increase of the lactate concentration in the coronary sinus over the concentration of the arterial blood as an expression of ischemia development, during inducibility of a VT/VF (group A).	1.0955108269929195
The control group consisted of 7 patients without ischemia related VT/VF (group B).	0.8891850192299119
Results: In group A significant changes of the three late potential criteria were found between t1 and t2 (QRS:115.61 +/- 13.86 vs. 126.06 +/- 16.74, p=0.08; RMS: 25.81 +/- 22.26 vs. 13.11 +/- 10.72, p=0.01; LAS: 37.72 +/- 19.26 vs. 50.06 +/- 10.72, p=0.01).	1.0883923372573743
In group B, no significant changes could be measured.	1.101418627949433
Furthermore, the prevalence of late potentials increased in group A from 66% (t1) to 89% (t2), whereas in group B no increase was detectable.	1.3566452618048936
Conclusions: These data suggest a dynamic behavior of ventricular late potentials in correlation with the inducibility of ventricular tycharrhythmias due to ischemic circumstances.	1.1058566680695878
Therefore the dynamic behavior of ventricular late potentials can be an expression of a modification of the arrhythmogenic substrate in arrhythmia endangered patients.	0.8241229249547208
Recent studies and reviews continue to report a high mortality associated with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which involves a severe inflammatory reaction within the whole lung that is frequently associated with multiple-organ failure.	1.0514474668767728
Important factors contributing to the poor results in severe ARDS are the aggressive procedures required to maintain sufficient arterial oxygenation, such as mechanical ventilation with high inspiratory pressures and high inspired oxygen concentrations (FiO2) which themselves contribute to the progression of the disease.	0.9889924544234079
As no specific therapy that reduces or prevents the general inflammatory reaction is known, current therapy is limited to procedures that minimize peak inspiratory pressures and FiO2.	0.988177617608018
Therefore, pressure- and volume-limited ventilation modes with positive end-expiratory pressure, controlled hypercapnia, differential lung ventilation when appropriate, positioning (particularly prone), and aggressive dehydration are used.	1.2339150168902027
Should these procedures fail to improve arterial gas exchange, the patients may be additionally treated by veno-venous extracorporeal gas exchange.	0.9478371597367752
To reduce the risk of severe haemorrhagic complications due to high levels of systemic heparinization, systems internally coated with covalently bound heparin, which allow a lower level of systemic anticoagulation, should be used.	0.9541416275031722
From April 1989 to August 1993, 89 patients were transferred to our intensive care unit for treatment of severe ARDS; 52 were treated by combining the described conventional methods without artificial gas exchange (survival rate 88%) and 37 additionally underwent artificial gas exchange (survival rate 57%).	1.0196278834110817
The overall survival rate was 75%.	0.8144968214385702
On the basis of these experiences, we conclude that this step-by-step approach may improve survival in patients with severe ARDS.	1.1845456380275416
Cutis marmorata teleangiectatica congenita (CMTC) is a rare congenital vascular disorder of the venous system.	1.0758494508937373
In 50% of cases there are associated anomalies of other organ systems.	1.1197734626312892
Clinical improvement of the cutaneous manifestations is noted in most cases and usually occurs during the first year of life.	1.150754056978156
We present a patient with CMTC with a band-like pattern following the L3 dermatome.	1.0088277898038616
At the age of 13 years, the skin manifestations worsened, with ulcerations and intermittent claudication.	1.1794049665978257
Angiographic imaging revealed stenosis of the deep femoral artery, and the circumflex femoral artery and the first perforating arteries were not visualized.	1.1361050617063067
To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of CMTC with anomalies of the large arteries.	0.9252929475325862
Introduction: The efficacy of vascular surgery in the treatment of popliteal arterial aneurysms (PAA) and the justification of conservative therapy was investigated in the present study.	1.32975794904479
Materials and methods: From January 1985 to December 1996, 87 patients were operated on for PAA.	1.0220661085090494
The clinical records were reviewed retrospectively and patients were categorized concerning PAA-related symptoms, vascular run-off, and material used for vascular reconstruction.	1.0998364425630085
Patients were examined, and the patency of the vascular reconstruction was checked by palpation and Doppler sonography.	1.1985860992228412
Results: The cumulative survival calculated using the Kaplan-Meier curve was 70% after 10 years.	1.238088391683773
Asymptomatic patients had the best results and patients with acute ischemia, the worst.	1.3629779910373572
The outcome concerning patent vs. occluded run-off and autologous vs. heterologous bypass material was similar.	0.8682410387510959
Conclusion: Asymptomatic and uncomplicated PAA should be treated surgically.	1.0841829135282597
Only PAA with a diameter less than 2 cm, and without thrombus on the vessel walls can be treated conservatively.	1.0811773646254543
Collodion baby is a clinical description for a transient condition of the newborn which is caused by various disorders of cornification.	1.051546232379249
The majority of cases are due to autosomal recessive lamellar ichthyosis.	0.9150223386846329
In up to 10% of cases "self-healing" of the skin occurs.	1.4534522982216695
We report about a mature male baby who at birth was covered entirely with a shining, collodion-like membrane.	0.9010033703716934
There also were marked ectropion of the eyelids and eversion of the lips.	0.8728686095648509
After shedding of the membrane almost complete clearing of the skin occurred until the age of three months.	1.1018561565090932
In the case reported here skin biopsies taken on the 20th day of life showed discrete and non-specific ultrastructural changes, with no features of lamellar ichthyosis or other cornification disorders.	1.1440194099973227
Past research on the phenomenon of enhanced pain sensitivity in fibromyalgia syndome (FS) revealed evidence for both a higher pain magnitude in response to nociceptive stimuli (hyperalgesia) and a general perceptual amplification of sensations (hypervigilance).	1.062786051522062
In order to distinguish between these two aspects of disturbed sensory processing in FS, cerebral evoked potentials after brief painful laser and auditory stimuli were measured in 10 FS patients.	0.9523248131832219
Results were compared with those from age-matched painfree controls.	0.9475901213955947
Amplitudes of middle-latency (N1) and long-latency (P2) laser evoked potentials (LEPs) were significantly higher in FS than in controls.	1.0347461335589714
Furthermore, laser intensity at pain but not at sensation threshold was lower in FS than in controls.	1.042988644026876
However, auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) did not differ between groups.	1.1193204377852588
Enhanced N1 and P2 amplitudes of LEPs suggest stronger sensory and attentional processing of nociceptive information in FS, respectively.	0.7667434853354941
The concept of hypervigilance is challenged by the failure to find differences in auditory perception among FS and control patients.	0.8837070362372428
Yet, the importance of unpleasant intensities of auditory stimulation, not applied in this study, to reveal abnormal non-nociceptive perceptual amplification in FS is discussed.	1.0861737340071072
In a prospective study, 53 fractures of the distal fifth of the tibia were stabilized by unreamed nailing.	1.1331053015906554
Additional involvement of the ankle joint occurred in 18 patients.	0.8631078895859999
50 patients returned for follow-up.	0.6562999089649543
In 30 patients tibia and fibula were fractured at the same (distal) level; in 20 patients the fracture of the fibula was located more proximally.	1.1112466364578761
In 12 patients the fractures extended into the tibial pilon.	0.8969845506622357
Severe soft tissue damage was seen in 24 fractures (18 open, 6 closed).	1.1415890232623374
Ninety percent of all fractures healed uneventfully without further surgical intervention after unreamed nailing.	0.9572834711426796
In two patients the unreamed nail had to be exchanged for a reamed tibial nail.	0.8785034528432222
Bone grafting and secondary dynamization of the nail by removal of a proximal interlocking bolt were performed in one case each.	1.1834242036750706
Thirty-one fractures healed in anatomical position.	0.9092375907978316
Valgus or varus angulation of less than 5  ° occurred in 18 patients.	0.844686294637931
One fracture healed with rotatory angulation of 15  °.	0.7257361374474737
The highest rate of complications (22 %) was seen in patients with distal fractures of the fibula without additional plating (of the fibula).	1.2325063207377869
There was no deep infection.	0.8645762960067617
Tibial fractures close to the ankle joint can be managed by unreamed nailing.	0.9896383949016696
Distal fractures of the fibula should be stabilized by additional plating.	0.9582230214806713
Because of the unreamed technique of implantation this procedure can also be used in grade II or III open fractures.	1.1197646356885638
Complex mechanisms have evolved in mammalian cells for regulating cellular lifespan.	0.7160078172579193
Normal cells demonstrate a strictly limited growth potential and senescence after a defined number of cell divisions.	0.8559186175785563
In contrast, tumor cells often exhibit an apparently unlimited proliferation potential and are termed immortalized.	1.0132378973197642
It has been proposed that the progressive shortening of the tips of the eukaryotic chromosomes - the telomeres - is an important component of senescence and is involved in the control of cell cycle.	1.2718957801711581
The enzyme telomerase adds TTAGGG repeats onto mammalian telomeres, preventing their shortening.	0.8141662395273997
Telomerase is normally inactive in most somatic cells, but detectable in tumor cells.	0.991381911036341
The activation of telomerase in malignant cancers seems to be an important step in tumorigenesis in order to gain the ability of indefinite proliferation and to become immortal.	1.0619500502675612
This review describes the present knowledge of telomeres and telomerase and their role in cellular senescence and human aging.	0.7923743411597011
It summarizes aspects of telomerase in cancer and its function as a diagnostic and prognostic tumor marker.	1.0365224740251828
PCR-based diagnosis of infectious diseases has developed into an important method in surgical pathology.	0.8223050539497218
We summarize our experience in this area based on 3500 analyses performed during the past 5 years.	1.1692971225947248
The peculiarity of material from a pathological laboratory is the risk of DNA fragmentation as a consequence of tissue fixation.	1.0304103752650535
For this reason the assays used must be adapted to this particular situation.	1.0186759950189817
PCR-based diagnosis of infectious diseases, if performed according to appropriate quality standards, is a safe and effective technique with high sensitivity and specificity and results in an etiologically based diagnosis.	1.1033490103384873
The shift of age distribution within the population of industrialized societies has led to an increased need of treating diseases in elderly patients and at the same time in a higher number of patients bearing an increased operative risk.	1.1397374150192872
Today, the development of surgical techniques and intensive care treatment enables us to carry out numerous procedures in geriatric patients.	1.0159828920405176
Innovative surgical techniques like minimal invasive surgery with minor trauma due to the surgical approach changed patient's categories, also.	1.1252991427403314
Taken together with other procedures causing less operative stress indications for patients who were not operable previously have changed.	1.0118531426450175
New developments such as organ transplantation and immunosuppression also generated totally new groups of patients with very distinct conditions for the operative procedure.	0.95292488749302
Vanishing indications or selection of patients as in peptic ulcer disease changed the surgical approach completely: Negative selection has shifted elective operative interventions in ulcer disease to emergency procedures.	1.0109707480865724
Contrasting experiences made in most other countries and especially in the third world, in Germany economic restrictions have not been encountered as of yet.	1.2494390984490062
Economical conditions, an increase in surgical procedures in elderly patients and advances in medical science will continue to change the surgical patient's characteristics profoundly.	1.1323318863296656
From the physicians viewpoint we have to actively participate in this development by personal interaction with the patient, by interdisciplinary cooperation and prompt social and political action.	1.080561238829972
Osteoid osteomas are tumors with intense clinical symptoms and extensive reactive bone changes far exceeding the volume of the lesion itself.	1.034482057304623
Because of their small size they can be approached by minimally invasive surgical procedures.	0.8789283451266597
We treated ten symptomatic patients with osteoid osteomas (n 6 hip point, n 1 iliac bone, n 1 femoral diaphysis, n2 tibial diaphysis) by excision of the nidus with a 3-mm Harlow-Wood needle using a percutaneous CT-guided approach.	1.1428459085348905
Seven patients with residual tumor were treated with either thermocautery (n 2) or sclerosis with 1 ml of 96% ethanol (n 5).	1.4612333258632013
Six patients had instant and constant relief (3 years' observation) of their pain.	1.2618618555575754
In two patients a second transcutaneous intervention was successful.	0.9503128187420117
Only two patients needed open resection.	0.8741649516640347
Compared with the invasive open resection of the tumors, sometimes even putting the stability of the femoral neck at risk, transcutaneous CT-guided enucleation of the nidus of the osteoid osteoma with additional sclerotherapy is a good alternative method, especially in the region of the femoral neck.	1.1236601217865634
We live in an epoch that could be designated as the post-Gutenberg-era.	0.7806129974787767
Writing is no longer the dominant sign system.	0.8860671024455553
It is replaced by electronic signs.	0.5366260083810354
We consider approximately the year 1950 as the turning-point between these two epochs, because by then, in the years after the 2nd World War the American households were saturated with televisions.	1.1615799953935118
Thereby, the new sign system asserted itself.	1.1004329150666645
The topic of this article is the transformation of our sign system and thereby of our worlds of symbols, the leap from the world of written signs into the world of electronic signs, and the possibility born out of it to create electronic objects, which I prefer to call virtual objects.	1.1748485912288866
The manipulation of object-choice and object-relationships accompanying this change and the role assigned to analysts in this new world will be considered as well.	0.8859673316400002
These electronic signs developed quickly a life of their own.	0.842098666042946
A totally new class of objects came into being, the class of virtual objects.	0.9418327981788449
These are electronically transformed, completed or wholly electronically produced objects.	0.7178921936958828
This procedure is accompanied by an industrialization of object-choice and object-relationships.	0.7232718508380492
The manipulated object-choice and object-relationship is born and, moreover, a displacement of natural objects through virtual ones.	1.0680352743524624
A change of the socio-cultural understanding is also a consequence of this process.	1.0697872444971914
New patterns of socio-cultural understanding develop, that could be described as industrial feudalism.	0.9452659023526699
The goal of this article is to describe the transformation of our world of signs and the connected industrialization of object relationships, and to interprete them according to our present possibilities.	1.1331644058046484
In this article 34 randomized controlled trials examining peripherally mediated opioid effects after knee surgery are discussed.	0.9418138471532147
All studies examined small doses of morphine injected intraarticularly at the end of knee surgery, but not all studies did show an analgesic effect of the peripheral opioid.	1.1641208895665385
Because of differing study designs a meta-analysis of the data is not possible.	0.9213598128362196
Dysplastic epithelia represent potentially precancerous conditions in which the risk of progression to cancer is unknown in the individual case.	1.0290610936423488
The positive predictive value of mild and moderate dysplasias of the uterine cervix is only about 13%.	0.8246159107993691
Using DNA image cytometry on restained, conventional Pap-smears the cytometric equivalent of chromosomal aneuploidy can be detected as marker for neoplastic transformation of cells.	0.9082768306145349
The identification of DNA aneuploidy in dysplastic squamous epithelia can increase the predictive value for malignant transformation to over 90%.	0.8960234230672376
DNA aneuploidy qualifies squamous intraepithelial lesions as high grade (H-SIL) which have to be treated whereas lack of DNA aneuploidy characterizes low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (L-SIL) which have only to be controlled.	1.1281009782597904
The methodology is meanwhile internationally standardized concerning performance and diagnostic interpretation.	0.742443162052184
In this brief article I attempt to sketch a few salient insights from my career as a researcher and practitioner of psychotherapy: The key to successful therapy is undoubtedly the therapist's empathic listening, coupled with a series of other positive attributes and finely honed interpersonal skills.	0.9039709057289615
On the debit side, patients' hostility frequently evokes counterhostility from the therapist which not infrequently results in a negative outcome.	0.9678381123912391
Percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy is a procedure for inserting a tracheal cannula without a large incision, without extensive dissection of pretracheal tissue, and without exposure of the trachea.	1.0740972058224465
The early complications of the technique are usually minor and late complications are rare.	1.0611065664976564
Although it is a simple procedure, it is not a minor operation.	1.4712546026589821
Users must be familiar with the technique, the indications and contra-indications for the procedure, as well as the complications.	1.0518839952316574
Proper training of the operation and knowledge of the procedure will avoid unnecessary complications.	1.1722557465377044
Percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy is a relatively new technique for inserting a cannula in the tracheal lumen.	0.9533918806282541
It can be done at the patients bedside with only minimal complications.	0.9364099137890445
A short history, the indications and contraindications, the early and late complications of the technique, and comparisons with other techniques as well as with conventional open tracheotomy are reviewed.	1.1853954865240186
In this study, a histologic and histomorphometric analysis of delayed and immediate-placed implants was performed.	0.9645389365126842
An implantation of 16 self-cutting conical titanium screw implants was carried out in 8 beagle dogs.	0.9527989115104867
Of these implants, 8 were placed immediately after extraction of the second premolar and 8 implants were placed after 6 months of healing after extraction.	1.1142335318619685
For dynamic histomorphometry, fluorochrome bone markers were injected at two different times prior to euthanasia.	0.7894590635237763
The specimens were examined macroscopically and microscopically 8 months after implantation.	0.8710025442218899
A histologic, dynamic, and static histomorphometry was performed with the aid of different computer programs.	1.2363353705311733
A mean surface of osseointegration of 75.7% and a mean soft tissue implant contact surface of 24.2% was seen in immediate-placed implants.	1.1572306840553708
For delayed implantation, an osseointegrated surface of 80.7% and a soft tissue covering of 19.3% was examined.	1.353745015462472
The fibrogenic structures in the cervical implant part were more dense and there were more adhesive epithelial elements (hemidesmosomes) around delayed implants.	0.9739052806057784
The result of the dynamic and static histomorphometry showed no significant differences in the two groups (P < 0.1).	1.0633027274754119
In conclusion, it can be stated that a new steady-state of the soft and hard tissue around dental implants was seen 8 months after implant insertion in both groups.	1.1310839795351406
There was a pseudoankylotic healing in the osseous part.	0.9694764637232787
The lower level of osseointegration in immediate-placed implants was caused by early resorption of bone in the crestal part.	0.8047509454068653
Thus, a larger part of the implant was surrounded by soft tissue and a long epithelial attachment resulted.	1.1669638457495886
Polydactyly may be preaxial or tibial (halluxside), postaxial or ulnar (side of the little toe) and central (middle toes).	1.06553336237298
The duplication may appear at the distal and medial phalanges or at the whole digit.	0.9598798406133842
The metatarsal bone may be partwise or completely duplicated, the accessory toes may share only one metatarsal.	0.8660551753595044
Surgical intervention may be indicated in shoeproblems, for esthetic reasons or, especially in duplication of the metatarsales, because of secondary deviation of the toes and therefore shoeproblems or plantar callosities.	1.1501015749998231
Preoperative analysis including x-ray is of great importance to achieve good functional and cosmetic results.	1.013135343464083
Across centers, transfusion can vary eightfold for the same mediastinal drainage after adult cardiac operations.	0.8276566894652269
Excessive blood drainage resulting in increased transfusions occurs in 29 % of patients.	0.8560376439270699
Various strategies have been proposed to decrease bleeding and allogenic transfusion requirements in the perioperative period of heart surgery.	1.0704334789049788
Blood conservation methods were reviewed critically.	0.6619307518060513
Avoidance of preoperative anemia, tolerance of low hemoglobin concentrations, the use of autologous blood, and adherence to a strict transfusion protocol will reduce the use of allogenic transfusions.	1.051059783584058
Perioperatively, maintenance of normothermia contributes to improved hemostasis.	0.7139452736810962
Injections with botulinum toxin type A (BTX) are considered the first-line treatment for spasmodic torticollis (ST), blepharospasm (BL) and hemifacial spasm (HFS).	1.0884044494611032
Because BTX brings only temporary and partial relief, patients frequently try other additional therapies to minimize their symptoms.	0.9318738799353881
The subjective rating of all therapies ever tried by patients with ST, BL and HFS was evaluated by using a simple questionnaire.	0.8947910562538612
Two hundred questionnaires were considered (112 TS, 54 BL, 34 HFS).	0.986263987593208
BTX was rated subjectively the best therapy in all three diagnostic groups (median: 2=good effect).	1.0428373802596826
Despite Citalopram and physiotherapy (median: 3=average effect), all other therapies were rated with a median of >=4 (=minimal effect).	1.162501688369447
Patients with ST tried 7.7, patients with BL 2.4 and patients with HFS 2.6 different types of therapy.	1.2376175250956218
In conclusion, BTX is the most effective treatment for patients with ST, BL and HFS, as rated subjectively.	1.019677545986328
Further evaluation of therapies additional to BTX injections is recommended.	0.7531553102521248
The perioperative morbidity and mortality is mainly influenced by the type and duration of surgery as well as the patient's preoperative state of health.	1.2767526698686733
Anesthesia per se, however, may also result in severe perioperative (patho)physiological changes, which may be both desired (e.g.	1.077605231281429
analgesia, vasodilation in vascular surgery) or detrimental (e.g.	0.7250041813189292
hypothermia, ventilatory depression) and which may differ depending on the anesthetic technique used (e.g.	0.8836218522388782
general anesthesia vs. regional anesthesia).	0.7889111284163203
Yet, all anesthestic techniques have in common, that their effects are not limited to the duration of the surgical intervention, but may expand far into the postoperative period.	1.3617917417137406
Therefore, many trials have been performed in the past aiming to compare the impact of different anesthetic techniques on the incidence of postoperative techniques, no significant advantage of one or the other technique has been identified up to now with respect to postoperative mortality or severe morbidity.	1.3186546232956617
This finding may be due to at least three factors.	0.7908151270118118
1) Many side-effects related to anesthesia - due to close postoperative monitoring - are detected and treated early in the postoperative phase (e.g.	1.20366644644066
in the recovery room), thereby preventing serious complications.	1.1502521364744966
2) Postoperative mortality related exclusively to anesthesia probably is so low, that huge patient numbers would be required to demonstrate any significant differences between different techniques.	1.1294177970756625
3) Besides the factor 'anesthesia', may other factors contribute to the anesthesia related morbidity and mortality (e.g.	0.9837648172058661
the factor 'anesthetist') which are hardly quantified.	1.1988460732455757
The fact that clear advantages for a single technique have not yet been demonstrated must not, however, result in anesthetic 'nihilism'.	1.0942652749455963
Rather there may be good reasons in the individual patient (e.g.	0.9286805142131783
lack of a recovery room), to prefer a certain anesthetic technique or drug over another, in order to lower the individual risk of anesthesia.	1.1052441404846747
Whether the use of a certain technique - e.g.	0.9222140097028318
spinal or epidural anesthesia - may contribute to a reduction of specific postoperative surgical complications (e.g.	0.913285306382354
rate of reocclusion subsequent to peripheral vascular surgery) is presently under investigation.	0.9225038075819666
This paper first describes how the project study on the regulation and monitoring of medical treatment arose.	0.9664680065780773
We then introduce its objectives, the members of the study group, the composition of the collective and selection of cases, and the methods used for ascertainment and recording of data.	1.186282454933918
Results are then presented with reference to the various hypotheses put forward.	0.9257248182320288
After some introductory remarks about the traumatizing experience many parents have after the birth of a very small preterm baby (<= 1500 g), a developmental risk model is presented.	1.1317881584830027
This is the basis for an early beginning preventive psychotherapeutic intervention.	1.1847173233088082
In the Ulm Study the comprehensive parent-centered intervention program includes insight oriented focal individual psychotherapy, supportive group psychotherapy, a home visit and a video-based sensitivity training.	0.9554233490947973
The intervention aims to improve parental coping, the process of attachment and parent-infant interaction.	0.8739775111519567
The theoretical implications, the design and the methods of this prospective randomized longitudinal study will be discussed.	1.2079002674069477
We report the case of a 55-year-old male patient who underwent transanal endoscopic microsurgery for recurrent benign rectal adenoma.	0.8970608880111496
He developed severe postoperative retroperitoneal phlegmon and sepsis and died 28 days after the operation due to untreatable diffuse intraabdominal bleeding caused by persistent thrombocytopenia.	0.9260244481001579
Rudolf Nissen was born in Neisse, Schlesien, 9 September 1896.	0.8933808466171524
From 1921 to 1933 he was the favorite pupil of Ferdinand Sauerbruch in Munich and Berlin.	0.7750951346705999
1930 he became professor of surgery at the Charité.	0.5586160886063616
The assumption of power by the Nazi-regime forced Nissen to resign his position and end his career in Germany.	0.8476857335909819
He took over the surgical chair in Istanbul, Turkey.	0.7388284868908946
Emigrating in 1939 to the USA, he held surgical positions in hospitals at New York and accepted in 1952 the chair of Surgery at the University of Basel, Switzerland.	0.9888640678900669
Nissen died in Riehen/Basel on 22 January 1981.	0.6752409798447458
Nissen was a critical observant clinician, an efficient and popular physician, a teacher and a speaker.	1.0404088278464914
Of historical significance are pioneering works in thoracic surgery, the first successful pneumectomy in man, the classical works about the treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and hiatus hernia.	1.1223592234952098
The Nissen-Rossetti type of fundoplication has remained the standard procedure in Europe and the USA.	0.9325013304460134
This study describes the approach that is necessary in outpatient surgery in order to carry out the operation safely.	1.0013445858471524
The particular procedure is discussed, and the necessity of strict postoperative management is shown.	1.1479601752448054
Between 1994 and 1997, the author supervised 4588 outpatient operations, of which 3020 were arthroscopic.	1.0193102606309468
The observed complications are listed and evaluated.	0.6921589092280089
Overall, outpatient surgery is well accepted by the patients.	1.1754235943685292
The criteria for denying a patient surgery on an outpatient basis are laid out.	0.9094120099912815
The Schering Atlas is a teaching file in CT and MRI anatomy designed for physicians and students.	0.8403160482653339
It is available on CD-ROM, shows good image quality, and is easy to use in medium-price-range personal computer systems.	1.0510197729627782
Because of the amount and quality of image material, the Schering Atlas's price is appropriate for institutions, but not for private users.	1.166103357511884
M. Linehan developed "dialectical behavioral therapy" specifically to treat chronically suicidal borderline patients.	0.6958459340924692
It rests on a biosocial model that assumes a disorder in the regulation of emotions and in tolerance of stress.	0.8524137213723264
The numerous dysfunctional patterns of behavior such as self-destructive behavior, inability to govern impulses or severe dissociative phenomena are regarded as attempts at problem-solving.	0.7565054361427509
This concept of therapy focuses on the continuing balance between the necessity of accepting maladaptive behavior patterns in both an intrapsychic and an interactional context while still working to change them.	0.8927440709025608
A comprehensive manual outlines the clearly structured therapy and integrates a wide choice of therapeutic strategies.	0.7885674057252295
Parallel to development of the therapy itself, a method also was developed for testing therapist adherence to the manual's guidelines, thus providing a basis for empirical evaluation.	1.171289515361959
An initial controlled, randomized study demonstrated the significant superiority of this method to methods of unspecific psychotherapy at various levels.	1.0636264906571242
In the current endeavor to develop disorder-specific approaches to the treatment of personality disorders, "dialectical behavioral therapy" is a noteworthy model.	1.1611823337965326
Complications associated with the application of a halo device are not infrequent; however, osteomyelitis of the skull with a consecutive subdural abscess is a rare but severe complication.	1.1637426667965796
We present the case of a patient with a subdural abscess as a result of a local pin-track infection of the halo device, in whom pathological behavior was the primary clinical finding.	1.2014396538588383
The possible complications associated with the halo device are discussed with emphasis on associated head injuries and preexisting neurological diseases, as well as indications for the halo, clinical symptoms of pin-track infections, necessary diagnostic measurements and the appropriate treatment.	1.1021337748307316
The attempt was made to explain dysfunctions of the motor system - analogical to electronic data processing systems - as a speciality of the regulation part of the motor system.	1.1760391184360968
Thereby dysfunctions can be seen as misplaced variables in the regulation software with not defined or unknown values of afferences or combination of afferences.	0.9813589686501323
This leads to a failure of the corresponding software modul that results in the loss of function which is regulated through this modul.	1.0394206860113702
Especially with changing of afference through manual treatment or through needling, a replacement of the variables can be reached and this leads to normal function.	1.0512586752588688
With this hypothesis all phenomens of dysfunctions can be explained.	0.7622247351699198
Empirical data on costs of care for chronically mentally ill patients in Germany are rare.	0.833867724105941
There is a lack of cross-sectional studies as well as of any analysis of the long-term course of mental health care costs.	1.0671677789664715
This study combines data from two cost-studies on patients with schizophrenia, conducted in the same catchment area at an interval of 15 years, to draw conclusions about the long-term course of these costs.	1.1155240690449912
The direct costs of comprehensive community based mental health care had increased by 77.0% during 15 years, while the costs of a permanents stay in a long-term ward of a psychiatric hospital had increased by 78.5% in the same period.	1.1297674780172813
This increase was 27 and 28.5 per cent higher than the general rise in cost of living in Germany during the interval between the two studies.	1.129687481376458
This higher-than-average increase in mental health care costs was accompanied by a much higher cost-effectiveness.	0.934115604081644
Thus, this rise of costs must be seen as a consequence of the great deficits and the resulting basic improvement of care for chronically mentally ill patients in Germany, which was demanded by an expert-commission of the government in the mid-seventies.	1.2067632938908266
Background: The usefulness of Holter monitoring to detect rarely occuring symptoms seems to be limited.	0.9431143987986673
In adults the event recorder has already been a precise diagnostic tool in evaluating palpitations and syncopes.	0.9213920409286901
There have been few reports of the implementation of cardiac monitoring with an event recorder in children.	0.9127813993023897
The immunomodulating effect of primary surgical intervention was investigated in 33 patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, pharynx and larynx.	0.9138759871399285
An operation time longer than 7 h was significantly associated with a decrease in lymphocytes, CD4+ T-lymphocytes and CD8+ T-lymphocytes.	0.9661640336886556
The CD4/CD8-ratio as a marker for the down-regulation of the cellular immune response was slightly decreased but was still in the normal range.	0.9629752707019821
CD4-lymphocyte counts increased 7 days after operation while CD8 lymphocytes were found elevated 4 weeks after sugery.	0.9443300096678872
The in vitro stimulation of the lymphocytes was impaired for 1 to 4 weeks.	0.9485802893935988
Interleukins, interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor did not show any changes after surgery.	0.9899276169057418
Decreases of lymphocytes, especially CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, were significantly associated with the time of operation and the volume of blood loss.	1.3349559640363693
Extensive trauma, age, different kinds of anesthesia and intensive care interventions were not associated with specific immunomodulating effects, although these factors might be responsible for suppressing cytokine responses.	1.0248780799736217
Both preclinical and clinical evidence support the usefulness of antidepressants in chronic pain treatment.	0.8575563585432155
Monoamine uptake inhibitors influence the neurotransmissions of noradrenaline (NA) and/or serotonin (5-HT); their effect on nociception is thought to take place predominantly within the spinal cord.	1.1028590456127945
Antidepressant drugs seem to differ in their properties as analgesics and as thymoleptics.	0.8482732848136271
The present work is aimed at correlating the special mechanism of action of antidepressants in diminishing nocicepetion with the pharmacological profile of these drugs in clinical pain treatment.	0.945555201886413
From a preclinical, experimental point of view, it can be expected, that mixed type uptake blockers should be superior to selective NA or 5-HT uptake inhibitors.	1.0716602254098104
The analgesic profile of antidepressants was established by a metaanalysis of clinical trials on the effect of these drugs, given alone or in combination with other analgetics, in chronic pain syndromes.	1.1772742540240824
57 Clinical trials were separated into 5 groups according to their scientific quality: [1] placebo-controlled double-blind studies with high power; [2] placebo-controlled double-blind studies with low power; [3-4] open controlled studies or studies with historical controls; [5] case reports.	1.1569490245298992
A study was positive if the tested antidepressant was more effective than placebo or the compared drug or seemed beneficial with respect to the interval of its previous absence.	1.0718546091069443
The most effective antidepressants in chronic pain treatment only included unselective monoamine reuptake inhibitors in the following rank order: amitriptyline > clomipramine >= desipramine >= imipramine >= doxepin.	1.1291575948091819
A statement about the appropriate dosage of these drugs in chronic pain treatment, however, must wait for properly conducted dose finding studies which include the measurement of plasma concentrations.	1.1518499776703284
Intensive care medicine for both surgical and medical patients has a common scientific and clinical basis.	1.1283277070613793
In critically ill patients the medical conditions are complex and can be managed only by specialists thoroughly trained in intensive care medicine.	0.9233785156248928
Therefore, surgeons as well as anesthesiologists must have a detailed theoretical and clinical knowledge of intensive care medicine.	1.1212895839363453
Surgical training places the emphasis on operative skills, while intraoperative management of the patient by the anesthesiologist calls for skills involved in intensive care medicine.	1.040226448494376
Interdisciplinary cooperation between specialists is essential to improve the quality of intensive care medicine further.	1.0105300579214331
The cooperation that already exists between surgeons and anesthesiologists makes closer collaboration in the future a logical step.	0.9251202162614394
In this review article data of retrospective studies on the therapeutic effects of oxygen are summarized and possible indications for this therapy suggested.	1.2255163055806493
Studies in infants with chronic lung disease (CLD) showed that (i) if SaO2 was kept >= 93 % via generous prescription of home oxygen, rates of sudden death were much lower than in studies where this was less generously prescribed, (ii) weight gain was significantly better with O2 therapy than without it, (iii) increasing SaO2 from 82 to 93 % by providing low-flow oxygen resulted in a 50 % reduction of pulmonary artery pressure, (iv) hypoxia could cause a significant increase in airway resistance, and (v) low-flow oxygen reduced the frequency of intermittent falls in SaO2 to < 85 % even in infants who had values of >= 90 % at rest.	1.2813925926279417
These data suggest that oxygen therapy should be considered in CLD infants if baseline SaO2 is < 93 %.	0.9972211961674203
For older infants, particularly with CF, only few data are available.	1.1100614862036546
In these patients oxygen may only be given if SaO2 is < 90 % unless there are clinical symptoms related to hypoxaemia, e. g. pulmonary hypertension.	1.099828123099371
Regarding the practical aspects of home oxygen therapy, provision of liquid oxygen via nasal cannulae appears to be the method of choice.	0.9201456804474071
Side effects include the risk of CO2 retention, which occurs occasionally in children with CF or sleep-related upper airway obstruction, but has not been reported for infants with CLD.	1.1392484836882375
To identify this potential side effect and to determine the exact amount of oxygen required, performance of a sleep recording of SaO2 and CO2 with and without oxygen is suggested.	0.9573764149090364
In infants with CLD, home monitoring of oxygenation should also be considered.	0.9662658358679688
Fractures of the distal radius represent one of the most common fractures and do have high social-economic relevance.	1.1428840401293787
For treatement they need practicable classification and therapeutic standards.	0.727887946382408
The demand for stable osteosynthesis of A3-, B2-B3 and C1-C2-fractures is connected to dorsal or volar internal fixation with plate and practical autogenous cancellous bone grafting, even for the elder patient.	1.0562351390640339
The isolated external fixation with K-wires represent special situation.	0.7943210987243156
Supply of implants and biodegradable materials will support this development.	0.6611837060708438
Introduction: Pheochromocytoma during pregnancy is rare and represents a high risk for mother and fetus.	1.1885614781656955
Due to the variable clinical presentation it may be mistaken for preeclampsia.	0.914812241685679
Case: A 34-year-old primiapara with hypertension up to 240/120 mmHg.	1.0139615648336888
After diagnosis of a pheochromocytoma its resection together with lymph node metastasis in the 17th week of gestation was performed.	1.0014974159852255
Conclusion: The definitive diagnosis is confirmed by elevation of serum catecholamines and their metabolites in a 24-h urine collection.	1.1490151158336837
Localization during pregnancy can be made by ultrasound and MRI.	1.0720280529378534
The definitive treatment is surgical removal after administration of adrenergic blockers.	0.7374548598219817
If discovered later in pregnancy, delivery by elective caesarean section followed by tumor resection is recommended.	0.7453643847988229
Since about 10 % of pheochromocytomas are malignant, postpartum screening is required to detect and treat extraadrenal or metastatic tumors by MIBG scintigraphy, chemotherapy or surgical procedures.	1.06575652161219
Ionizing radiation from natural or man-made sources may affect human health.	0.74607852866111
The main consequence of low and moderate radiation doses is the induction of cancer.	0.8687221017774259
To quantify these effects both epidemiological studies and experimental radiobiological research are needed.	0.7900652818180788
The ensuing results of the studies are used to establish radiation protection principles and dose limits to protect the public from the effects of ionizing radiation.	1.027128513075053
Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is associated with premature atherosclerosis and early cardiovascular death if untreated.	0.8042961225347843
In an asymptomatic 13-year-old girl we discovered an extensive hypoplasia of the abdominal aorta and the Aa.	1.1342542093563799
iliacae, a combination which so far has not been described, that has not been reported before.	1.2902426739009376
The vascular hypoplasia was asymptomatic.	0.5219137242324586
Angiography additionally showed severe atherosclerosis of the Aa.	0.7065936065367322
After 13 months of low-density-lipoprotein(LDL)-apheresis angiographically there was no pregression, but even slight improvement of vascular the disease.	1.2321747531654206
Discussion: Since severe atheromatous changes of systemic arteries may be missed by clinical examination, we strongly recommend complete imaging of all major systemic arteries in children with homozygous familial hypercholesterinemia.	1.10183983438677
LDL-apheresis is the treatment of choice in these patients.	0.9585011817999445
Since 1993 almost 400 patients with port wine stains have been treated with the flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser.	0.7962311083558671
The therapeutic effect on 61 adult patients was evaluated.	0.9009793092249092
After a mean of 2.16 treatments the colour lightened by between 33% and 100% in 70% of these patients.	1.3559660625925052
The best results were obtained in patients with plain pink port wine stains.	0.8797441020893947
In this kind of port wine stains the argon laser has proved to be far less successful.	0.6769994502820013
The rate of adverse effects amounted to only 5%.	0.8726207806140364
The results are expected to be improved by further laser sessions.	1.1738646027703161
The flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser is an important advance in the treatment of port wine stains.	0.8400378754513714
Most craniofacial malformations result from a premature fusion of skull sutures.	0.8435469223618077
Depending on the scope of the sutures affected, the results are more or less distinct deformations of the facial and cranial skull with substantial negative effects on functional as well as esthetic aspects.	1.168835613063139
The etiopathology is still unclear.	0.43426578858327675
Various therapies have been developed over the past 100 years.	0.963295818281204
However, Tessier's technique of fronto-orbital advancement has been an important milestone in the treatment of these malformations.	1.2925691635158125
Numerous adjustments have since perfected this operational technique.	0.5776559299286277
It is now possible to treat practically all skull malformations with the surgical techniques available today.	1.0101452078140927
At the same time, these techniques have also aided the advancements in tumor surgery and traumatology.	0.9780060019169446
Injuries of the flexor tendon are usually open injuries.	0.8222791539669154
In most cases primary treatment is therefore seldom performed by orthopaedic surgeons.	0.9110114622876673
This is different for injuries of the extensor tendon.	0.6822275277959451
Three quarters of injuries of the extensor tendon are closed injuries.	0.8683642558279479
Therefore we do go into primary and secondary reconstruction of the flexor tendon, but focus on primary and secondary reconstruction of the extensor tendon in the most common zones (1, Th I, 3, Th III).	1.1589574245643293
The Shouldice operation has evolved to become the classic procedure for open pure tissue repair for inguinal hernias.	0.885320308358085
The operation is an important part of a surgeon's repertoire as he may need to perform the procedure at some critical time, especially when faced with strangulation, when tension-free prosthetic repairs and laparoscopic approaches fail.	1.1307515423897156
When properly done, the Shouldice repair yields results that have set standards for all other techniques to emulate.	0.9808490514820786
Other particular advantages of the technique are: safety, the use of local anaesthesia, benign postoperative complications and the cost, which is the most reasonable of all surgical techniques.	1.2580742206278623
Acute occlusive mesenteric ischemia is caused by a local impairment of splanchnic blood flow and poses a particular surgical challenge.	0.8989256197127595
Acute superior mesenteric occlusion is a medical/surgical emergency mandating prompt diagnosis (clinical awareness, angiography) and therapy (exploratory laparotomy with possible arterial reconstruction; embolectomy, thrombectomy; and/or bowel resection).	0.9710608224564276
The difficulty of early diagnosis is probably the most important cause of the high mortality which varies from 70 % to 90 % in arterial and functional mesenteric ischemia and from 20 % to 70 % in an acute thrombosis of the mesenteric veins.	1.516959946894583
Improved survival from nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia is dependent upon the identification of high-risk groups and on aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic measures (intra-arterial infusion of papaverine through the angiographic catheter with or without bowel resection).	0.9603460007548534
For assessment of bowel viability, the clinical judgement during first- or second-look exploration is still the most reliable parameter.	1.2556569259878478
The surgical management of chronic mesenteric ischemia includes aortomesenteric grafting and transaortic endarterectomy in the majority of patients with comorbidity of cardiovascular arteriosclerotic diseases and results in a high rate of symptom-free patients.	1.010462004055358
Prophylactic reconstruction of visceral arteries is indicated only in certain limited circumstances.	0.8817994238681569
Thirty-nine of 63 patients undergoing deep anterior rectal resection received a straight coloanal anastomosis (CAA); the remaining 24 patients additionally had a colon-j-pouch (CPA) constructed.	0.9304043877964199
After pouch-anal anastomosis, local septic complications occurred in 12.5 % of patients compared to 20.5 % after coloanal anastomosis.	1.2109970266490515
Stool frequency after pouch-anal anastomosis was 3.3 per 24 h compared to 5.2 per 24 h after straight anastomosis within the first year after ileostomy closure (P = 0.053).	1.1407773257341
Continence was slightly better in the pouch group (n. s.), and anal manometry showed a significant postoperative decrease only in resting pressure after straight coloanal anastomosis (P < 0.001).	0.9641988196851728
This study supports the construction of a colon-j-pouch after deep rectal resection, as the pouch-anal anastomosis has fewer local septic complications and seems to improve functional outcome.	1.0256425476016922
The introduction of flow-directed pulmonary artery (PA) catheters has helped to improve our knowledge of cardiovascular physiology.	0.8996346215349078
There have been several developments of this equipment in recent years, including continuous monitoring of mixed-venous O2 saturation (Sv\=O2) and cardiac output (CO).	1.0383302146694593
The high purchase price, however, is an obstacle to its use in the critically ill.	1.1874292467716638
The aim of the present study was to analyse the actual costs of these devices in comparison to standardly used intermittent monitoring of Sv\=O2 and CO.	0.942067752572366
Purpose: Persistent hypotony with maculo-pathy is a severe complication of mitomycin C when used during filtration surgery.	1.036667446359847
We wanted to know whether this complication can be controlled by a surgical reintervention yielding tight closure of the initial sclerostomy.	1.052559893073565
The detection of cytokines may elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms that produce early systemic complications in acute interstitial (i) or necrotizing (n) pancreatitis (AP).	1.0030290771683406
The increase in the level of cytokines in the blood of patients with AP may correlate with the severity of the disease.	1.1478297619822388
In a prospective clinical trial from October 1992 to August 1993, 23 patients with AP were recruited and blood samples taken for cytokine detection by commercially available Elisa kits and C-reactive protein (CRP) by laser nephelometry.	0.9868755609097075
Six of 11 patients with nAP died either early (n = 1) or of late septic complications.	1.0443789421768008
The peak of cytokine and CRP level in the first 3 days of hospitalization was used for calculation.	1.2221406089415652
The IL-6 concentration in the blood reached up to 2600 pg/ml in the 1st few days, depending on the severity of AP, and dropped to almost zero in the next days, independently of the clinical course.	1.0056287016530878
The differentiation of i- versus nAP, using a cutoff line of 600 pg/ml, was correct in 20 patients [87 %, sensitivity (SE): 82 %, specificity (SP): 91 %, P < 0.001].	1.2768402056882615
The blood levels of IL-8 reached a maximum of 1381 pg/ml in the 1st few days, depending on the severity of AP, and showed a correlation with the clinical course in the following days.	0.9999895678940425
The peak of IL-8 blood levels indicated correctly the severity of AP in 18 out of 23 patients using a cutoff level of 200 pg/ml (accuracy: 78 %, SE: 82 %, SP: 75 %, P < 0.01).	1.1299571498474013
The CRP levels increased up to a maximum of 535 mg/l and indicated the course of AP correctly in 18 out of 22 patients (SE and SP 82 %, P < 0.01).	0.9799675053678795
There was no correlation between cytokine blood levels and mortality.	0.8940286767501582
In the blood samples of five patients with i- or nAP, no TNF- was detectable.	1.3046878644529794
The blood levels of IL-6, and to a lesser extent of IL-8 and CRP, can predict the severity and early systemic complications of AP.	1.2238977544279406
The excessive rise in cytokines can be explained by the stimulation of immunological cells (macrophages, lymphocytes and endothelial cells) in the course of AP, inducing early systemic complications.	0.9990066262482116
The surface area and the microporosity of bone regeneration materials influence their chemical and biological properties.	0.7947924661177909
Therefore, the size of the specific surface area and the distribution of the pore diameters (pores < 1 µm) of bone regeneration materials were analyzed within this study.	1.1035348350684635
The analyzed hydroxyapatites were of synthetic, bovine, and phytotroph origin.	0.9841177037781679
The tricalcium phosphates and the bioglasses included only synthetic materials.	0.6513238440115616
The gas adsorption of each specimen was analyzed using a volumetric N2/Kr system (ASAP 2010, Micromeritics).	0.7954164025779932
Additionally, for materials with a specific surface area (> 2 m2/g) the pore size distribution was evaluated by the BJH-method.	1.2650222855968198
Two of the materials evaluated astonishingly large dimensions of the specific surface area (BioOss 79.7 m2/g, Algipore new 14.6 m2/g).	0.7585612286591594
A medium surface area was found for Algipore old (4.9 m2/g) and Interpore200 (2.64 m2/g).	1.2617190800949953
All other included materials showed only small sizes of the specific surface area (Ceros80 1.8 m2/g, Ceros82 1.31 m2/g, Cerasorb 1.2 m2/g, Biobase 0.7 m2/g, Endobone 0.7 m2/g, Perioglas 0.6 m2/g, Allotropat50 0.23 m2/g, Biogran 0.2 m2/g).	0.9253088667813583
The materials with large and medium sizes of the specific surface area evaluated the following pore diameters: BioOss 2-50 nm, Algipore new 2-100 nm, Algipore old 5-50 nm, Interpore200 2-100 nm.	0.9230765818383883
Pore sizes less than 2 nm were not found in relevant numbers.	0.9119708063880443
The materials BioOss, old and new Algipore, and Interpore200 contain a large interconnecting mesopore system (diameter < 1 µm).	1.0547552890785177
For the materials Biobase, Endobone, Perioglas, Allotropat 50, and Biogran this cannot be assumed.	0.9392777033701826
The materials Ceros80, Ceros82, and Cerasorb evaluated a specific surface area between those and might include only a small part of these interconnecting pores.	1.0558500798590438
An influence of the interconnecting porosity and the different sizes of the specific surface areas on the biological behavior of the bone regeneration materials can be suggested.	1.0944029332253924
The literature on the psychosocial aspects of head and neck cancer surgery from 1950 to 1995 was reviewed in four parts.	0.4997128130755671
In the present Part 4 ten possibly useful targets for future research are formulated:...	0.9950412094346848
Radiotherapy unequivocally has to be regarded as standard therapy in stage I and IIA/B testicular seminoma.	0.9171916331601399
Using low dose abdominal irradiation tumour control rates of 95-98 % in stage I disease and 80-95 % in stage IIA/B can be achieved.	1.2699085022648873
Disease specific survival reaches 100 %.	0.6699854501248564
Likewise, radiotherapy is treatment of first choice in case of testicular intraepithelial neoplasia (TIN) in a solitary testis or in case of a double-sided TIN yielding safe eradication of the in-situ carcinoma of the testis.	1.2316960882619064
Objectives of further clinical research in radiotherapy of testicular malignancies aim at reduction of treatment intensity in order to minimize acute and late side effects of irradiation without compromising tumour control rates.	1.0217304495206498
A forty year old healthy adult man was admitted to our out-patient department because of a highly elevanted rheumatoid factor.	0.9998003824273908
Since the person was planning an extended stay in Africa, we performed an extensive history, clinical and laboratory examination to rule out oligosymptomatic inflammatory diseases.	1.1646523059731766
We further analyzed if the person presented genetic risk factors to develop rheumatic diseases in the future or if the presence of the rheumatoid factor could be a reaction to multiple immunizations.	1.114554392960838
Possible explanations for an elevated rheumatoid factor including the genetic risk factors are discussed.	0.9283604147140102
A multifactorial etiology underlies the  majority of cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD).	0.8109171953919175
Both ill-defined environmental and genetic factors contribute to the development of the disease.	0.8086229900617492
Allele 4 of ApoE is a genetic risk factor.	0.8033046883799813
Its presence increases the risk of developing AD.	0.8856547777661233
However, presence of e4 is neither necessary nor sufficient for the disease to arise.	1.2368674073032346
Apart from the common multifactorial forms of the disease, there are rare variants which are inherited as Mendelian traits.	1.094142625907111
To date three genes are known that can be  mutated in these rare forms of AD.	0.8498465086293959
Of these, mutations in the gene presenilin 1 on chromosome 14 are most frequent.	0.855800457466354
In addition, mutations in the gene presenilin 2 on chromosome 1 and in the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP on chromosome 21) occur in autosomal dominant AD.	1.0097051253960183
This article reviews our present knowledge of the genetics of AD and discusses its relevance for patients with AD and their relatives.	1.0936685879742907
In recent years female psychoanalysts provided fertile approaches to an understanding of the mother-daughter-relationship with the conceptions of the 'lesbian complex' (Poluda-Korte), the 'symbiotic illusion' (Halberstadt-Freud), the 'higher permeability of the ego-boundaries' (Rohde-Dachser), and the 'conflict of separation-individuation which has to be resolved again and again throughout life' (Berger).	1.0159571688768907
In the light of these conceptions it is hypothesized that in analyses with both participants being of equal gender (female-female psychoanalyses) a specific intensity and quality of female aggression may manifest itself when certain threshold situations of the pre-oedipal mother-daughter-relationship are revided.	0.944839290450169
Case vignettes and a literary example illustrate the risks as well as possible resolutions engendered by these early relationship dynamics, as these are reactivated in the here and now of the analyst's relationship towards her patient.	1.0569800135757927
There has been a marked increase in the incidence of pelvic fractures over the last few years.	0.9798217367146691
Associated injuries to the urogenital and vascular system as well as nerve injuries worsen the prognosis.	0.8528244507698348
Over a five year period 126 patients with severe pelvic trauma were treated.	0.972646778905734
Out of these 39 (30.9%) sustained additional peripelvic injuries and represent the study sample.	1.1619462628523909
Type B injuries according to the AO classification occurred in 16 (41%) patients, type C fractures in 23 (59%) patients.	1.2321243876340982
The spleen, liver and kidney were the most frequently injured organs (58.9%), followed by urogenital lesions (46.6%), nerve injuries (25.6%) and vascular lesions (15.3%).	1.1561987321423728
The most common extrapelvic lesions were thoracic injuries in 56.4% and severe head injuries (GCS<8) in 33.3%.	1.2278092712210662
The mean Hannover Polytraumascore was 35.6 points, the mean Injury Severity Score 27.6 points.	1.19825807115685
Osteosnthesis was performed in 21 pelvic ring fractures (53%), eight procedures (50%) in type B fractures and 13 (56%) in type C fractures.	1.309065766158859
In type B injuries the anterior pelvic ring was stabilized with a tension band wiring in four cases, in two patients with an external fixator and with plate osteosynthesis in one case.	1.2510612725391304
In type C injuries the external fixator was applied as the only stabilizing procedure in six patients.	1.0709919121798896
In four cases the anterior ring was fixed with tension band wiring or plates and the dorsal aspect of the pelvic ring with sacral bars.	1.0355367715916117
Three patients had their additional acetabular fracture plated through a anterior approach.	0.8554232316044477
All surviving 28 patients were followed up for an average of 18 months (range 7--59 months) after the trauma.	1.2831071639079732
The patients were classified using the pelvic outcome score proposed by the German Society of Trauma Surgery.	1.0560736952697931
53.4% of the type B fractures showed a good clinical outcome, 47.6% a poor outcome.	1.2589397426380413
15.4% with type C fractures presented with a good outcome, 84.6% with a poor outcome.	1.2726672224818723
80% of the type B and 23% of the type C fractures had a good radiological outcome.	1.3660571440961935
20% of type B and 77% of type C injuries had a poor radiological outcome.	1.4045130216648898
Five patients (12.8%) sustained persistent urological symptoms.	1.1405445002966008
Three of these had urinary dysfunction, two used permanent cystotomies due to their severe neurolgical deficit after a head injury.	0.943629501332923
Ten patients with nerve injuries at the time of trauma suffered long term neurological dysfunction of the lumbosacral plexus.	1.0066045153649879
The mortality rate was 28%.	0.9962764292684259
Seven patients died in the emergency room due to uncontrollable bleeding, four in the intensive care unit from multi-organ failure.	0.9300649116842896
The management of complex pelvic trauma consists of fracture treatment and interdisciplinary treatment of the associated injury.	1.0760698752126994
Lesions of the abdominal organs or of major vessels must be addressed first if hemodynamic instability is present.	0.974108453047837
Injuries to smaller vessels can be embolized percutaneously.	0.6038839004185547
Urinary bladder ruptures are treated as an emergency, urethral lesions electively after four to six weeks .We recommend external fixation of the pelvis in the acute phase for control of both the osseous instability and control of haemorrhage through external compression.	1.1487353994738267
The treatment of choice for the anterior pelvic ring is tension band wiring or plating.	1.0480377133254184
If this is contraindicated due to an open fracture external fixation is the treatment of choice.	1.097679931585925
Type C fractures require posterior ring stabilization which should be postponed until four days post admission.	0.7766708225220222
Dysfunction of serotonergic neurotransmission has been associated with two different psychopathological syndromes - impulsive aggressivity resulting form a lack of stimulation of the "behavior inhibition system" on the one hand and the manifestation of clinical depression and compulsive syndromes on the other.	1.003028213448404
The examination of primate behavior provides a model which may reconciliate these seemingly contradictory hypotheses.	0.8006519458328403
According to primate experiments, monoaminergic depletion results in anxious and desperate behavior only if the individual has previously been exposed to social isolation stress, which in turn induces a decrease in the central serotonin turnover rate.	0.9989150107924497
Young non-human primates who experience early social separation stress are anxious and fearful, while as adults they tend to be aggressive, consume excessive amounts of alcohol and are less intoxicated by alcohol intake.	0.9175876522605098
These observation indicate the importance of social separation stress in the pathogenesis of alcoholism and antisocial behavior and may point to prophylactic and pharmacological treatment strategies.	0.926227155824933
The implantation of transsclerally sutured posterior chamber lenses (PCL) leads to greater trauma to the eye than endocapsular PCL implantation.	0.7144067718223549
Persistent breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier might impair the postoperative long-term prognosis.	0.9904846412489213
Using laser-tyndallometry, we quantified the disorder of the barrier function during the early postoperative phase and in the long-term postoperative course for both surgical procedures.	1.2194786483718163
During the first 3 postoperative days, flare values were three times higher in the group with transsclerally sutured PCL than in the conventional PCL group.	1.1984797301373826
Cell counts after transscleral suture fixation (27.7 +/- 18.3/0.075 mm3) decreased slightly during the first 5 postoperative days.	1.0398940409520863
In contrast, the conventional PCL group regained the preoperative level (2.5 +/- 5.1) after 3 days.	1.2325456767654654
After 3 months, no significant differences in flare values and cell counts were seen between the two groups.	0.9427781212265336
After implantation of transsclerally sutured posterior chamber lenses, breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier was initially more pronounced than in conventional PCL implantation.	0.890697493572983
However, the barrier function was re-established equally in both groups in the long term.	1.0907617156196994
No signs of a persistent disorder of the barrier were found.	0.9201681210885289
There is clear evidence for obstructive sleep apnea as an independent cause of arterial hypertension.	0.9394716147936322
We report a case of intracranial hemorrhage with systemic hypertension resistant to antihypertensive medication, which could only be adjusted after effective treatment of coexisting sleep-disordered breathing.	1.0169324313680563
The 36 year old male (body mass index 31 kg/m2) was admitted to hospital three weeks before for intracranial bleeding at the left external capsule.	1.0716437475909275
Diagnosis of primary hypertension was made after extensive work-up in the acute hospital.	1.2797046258476024
Blood pressure was adjusted with five-fold antihypertensive medication at the time of admission to neurological rehabilitation, but was still elevated with "non-dipping" as determined by long-term measurement despite medications above the recommended dosages.	1.1194367577179067
Polysomnography confirmed the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea.	0.7718785554655617
10 days after initiation of treatment with nasal CPAP blood pressure control was easier with normal dipping at night.	0.953525583122574
Medication could be reduced during rehabilitation with further reduction after discharge.	0.9122714687521284
Moderate obstructive sleep apnea appears to be the cause of severe hypertension resistant to pharmacological therapy in this patient.	0.9769351894548179
The case underlines the impact of diagnosis and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing for the secondary prevention of stroke.	0.979337100510452
The possibility of a specific origin of joint infection should be considered in finding the diagnosis.	1.1040336152403127
This is demonstrated in a case of tuberculosis of the hip treated in the Dept.	1.2633283103229636
of Trauma Surgery in collaboration with the Medical Dept.	1.0240002499718943
Microbiological and imaging examinations are essential to plan and perform a combined therapy of hip arthroplasty and concomittant medical antituberculous therapy.	0.9531814830655897
In accordance to a literature review, this procedure proved successful for both eliminating the local infection and the functional outcome of the operation.	1.2708498836981563
The purpose of our studies was to investigate experimentally the dose-dependent effects of extracorporeal shock waves on tendon and bone and to unveil therapeutic possibilities in tendopathies and pseudarthroses.	1.2201517878158523
From January 1994 to January 1996, 18 patients underwent vitrectomy as a result of endophthalmitis.	1.0753343228074608
All patients received intraocular and systemic antibiotics in accordance with the first group of patients in the Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study.	1.2027494026091023
The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze the visual outcome of surgical treatment.	1.169065728318574
Tracheostomy is considered the airway management of choice in long-term ventilated ICU patients.	1.175343797731551
In the last few years, percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) has been established as an attractive and safe alternative to conventional open tracheostomy.	1.131236410128847
Recently, there is another percutaneous technique according to Fantoni with translaryngeal airway access (TLT) available.	1.0754982754314595
Our study seeks to evaluate TLT in terms of complications and practicability.	0.7851151123761079
In 47 patients of our surgical ICU, elective TLT was performed.	0.8869954367458467
Mean operative time was 9.8 +/- 10.9 (range 6-27) minutes.	1.114309329329789
Severe complications, such as bleeding, aspiration or infection of the tracheostoma have never been noted.	0.8789757731499337
A slight detoriation of arterial oxygen tension occured in 25 patients intraoperatively, demanding to rise the concentration of inspired oxygen temporarily.	0.9112498534091644
However, no patient became hypoxic during the procedure.Since during the procedure gas exchange may worsen, TLT should not be employed in patients whose inspired oxygen concentration exceeds 80%.	1.1568954189777934
Despite the fact that severe complications associated with TLT have recently not yet been reported, physicians who perform TLT should be well-trained in the technique of conventional open tracheostomy, too.	1.0248086151123896
According to our present data, TLT seems to be an attractive and safe alternative to PDT.	1.0357877725843556
Nevertheless, for a definiteve evaluation of TLT, further investigations in larger groups of patients and in the long term seem to be necessary.	1.4792292012429473
There are no direct associations between testosterone levels and sexual function in the aging male.	0.9753635378312546
A study of 169 patients focusing on the relations of hormone levels and sexual dysfunction did not reveal associations between testosterone levels and the risk of altered sexual functions.	0.9581183085247859
In volunteers, in whom a hypogonadism was generated by the application of GnRH, no alteration in sexual reactions occurred.	1.0841487917626818
It is possible that other testosterone fractions are more meaningful than the total testosterone.	0.9896909730300141
However, all the known fractions correlate closely.	1.4033694680523656
The significance of a normal testosterone level for a normal erection has been rarely considered up to now.	1.1042299539071474
In an animal experiment, the intracavernous pressure, the density of -receptors, and the PDES activity depended on normal testosterone levels.	1.2884734766921864
It is not known whether different testosterone levels influence the effectiveness of treatment procedures for erectile dysfunction in humans.	1.0400512298765459
In a 65 years old male patient 38 cc of a 7.45% potassium chloride-solution was inadvertently infused within 3 hours into an epidural catheter on the first postoperative day.	1.0996837382799691
The epidural potassium chloride administration resulted in a paresis and painful paraesthesia of the patient's legs and a level of sensory blockade to TH 11.	0.9795544537252345
Furthermore vegetative symptoms like hypertension and tachycardia were observed.	0.6507292559034934
For therapy a single bolus of 40 mg dexamethasone was administered intravenously followed by an epidural infusion of sodiumchloride 0,9% 99 cc/h for several hours.	0.9873725396141767
About 6 hours after the start of infusion all symptoms had disappeared.	0.6482840512491789
It is proposed that the use of colour-coded epidural catheter devices and coloured electrolyte solutions as well as infusion-pumps with a larger reservoir that reduce the frequency of syringe changes would be helpful in avoiding such complications.	0.9363213913419779
This paper reviews respiratory muscle/circulation interaction in congestive heart failure.	0.8753853110734696
Respiratory muscle dysfunction consisting of both reduced pressure - generating capacity and reduced endurance is well documented in these patients.	0.9315726048303682
The mechanisms underlying its development and the potential consequences especially in the development of dyspnea are then presented.	0.986334831773013
Not only are respiratory muscles dysfunctioning in these patients, but under specific circumstances they can impede the circulation, such as during weaning from mechanical ventilation.	0.897499324163503
The underlying pathophysiology and the theoretical model explaining this interesting interaction is finally discussed.	0.8330151839638771
Traumatic, perilunate dislocations are rare lesions, and one third of them are associated with perilunate dislocation fractures.	1.0398174479793703
Unfortunately, one quarter of all such fractures go unrecognized, although conventional X-rays can allow their diagnosis in as many as 48% of cases, which can be improved by performing CT or bone scan in addition to 62% and 95%, repectively.	1.2787061311770578
Forced extension seems to be the most frequent trauma mechanism.	1.0946289536696419
The treatment consists of open reduction, predominantly of the lunate bone, and internal fixation.	1.0799827962830544
Huge carpal fragments such as the scaphoid and capitatum are ideally fixed by means of compression screws, while smaller fragments can only be aligned with Kirschner wires.	0.9346668681453499
Osteochondral chips are best reinserted into the bone by means of anchoring systems.	0.7747902268682931
In cases of complex carpal instability supplementary stabilization may be achieved with an external fixator.	1.016557794201953
The best results on the Martini evaluation score were achieved in simple perilunate dislocations that were reset early by open surgical procedures and were accompanied by minimal involvement of/damage to different tissues.	0.9702875033623353
Although we had a nonunion rate of approximately 20% in our series of 11 mixed traumatized patients in all, the Martini classification of hand function seems to be a reliable score system for practical clinical follow-ups.	1.257423153528766
Maternal anxiety in the event of a false positive result is an argument against universal hearing screening in newborns.	0.8884566211513263
The aim of this study was to investigate the mothers' attitudes towards neonatal hearing screening and their anxiety in case of a positive result.	0.989155485337214
Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon- (IFN-) were both administered subcutaneously (SC) in combination with intravenously (IV) applied 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for the treatment of patients with metastasized renal cell carcinoma (RCC).	1.1610292726846518
The therapy protocol consisted of a treatment cycle of 8 weeks, which could be carried out in an outpatient regimen.	1.0983068624281278
The IFN- was given in each of the 8 weeks (6-9 MU/m2 once to three times weekly SC) combined sequentially with IL-2 (5-20 MU/m2 three times weekly SC for 4 weeks) and 5-FU (750 mg/m2 IV weekly for 4 weeks).	1.2277050208767322
Among the 30 consecutive patients treated, in 2 cases a complete, and in 9 cases a partial, remission was achieved in patients with mostly lung and skeletal metastases, with an overall objective response rate of 37 %.	1.2713615284517383
Mean response duration was 8 months (range 3-18 months).	0.9282718290643649
A stable state of the disease lasting 3-18 months was observed in 10 cases.	1.3265705524036613
The side effects were only slight and corresponded to toxicity grade I (n = 2), grade II (n = 22) and grade III (n = 6), according to the WHO classification.	1.245226241203656
In conclusion, this triple-drug biochemotherapy demonstrated significant clinical effectiveness comparable with that of an aggressive IL-2 treatment regimen (applied IV), but without its high toxicity.	1.2613364754933578
Compression therapy was employed for 4 weeks 20 patients with chronic venous insufficiency stage CVI I and CVI II according to Widmer's classification.	1.0097569050272497
Compression bandaging for 2 weeks was followed by compression stockings for 2 more weeks.	0.8104510988527628
The cutaneous microcirculation was evaluated before therapy, after 2 weeks and after finishing compression therapy after 4 weeks.	1.0566341880679098
Marked improvement in symptoms such as pain and itching was observed after 4 weeks, along with a significant reduction in lower limb volume.	0.9791296837402146
Video capillary microscopy revealed an increase in capillary density associated with a decrease in capillary diameter and pericapillary halo diameter.	0.9050500216495093
Compression treatment achieves at least part of its effect by improving the function of the skin microcirculation.	1.0237732592460496
The efficacy of bandaging and stockings was similar.	0.5960916373635944
The splanchnic perfusion is reduced early in the course of any shock.	0.7761317573095246
The mucosa of the gut suffers most as it experiences a high oxygen demand even in the steady state.	0.9545317382365205
The specific arrangement of the micro vessels within the villus of the mucosa exposes the tip of the villus at the highest risk for ischemia, particularly in low flow states.	1.00527155547959
As a consequence the integrity of the mucosal layer is compromised and dysfunction of the mucosal barrier may allow bacteria and toxins to translocate from the gut lumen.	1.0744093918880082
Activation of leukocytes and stimulation of cytokine synthesis may comprise a sustained inflammatory response syndrome.	0.7523105255979717
So far there is a good body of evidence that the splanchnic region may play an important role in the pathophysiological sequence from shock to organ dysfunction.	1.0137969610061133
As pacing impedance is inversely related to pacing current, the increase of pacing impedance additionally decreases pacing current.	0.9044746864012536
Whether the impedance measurement at implantation predicts the outcome during follow-up, was studied in 87 patients who received the VDD-single lead UniPass 425 connected to the pacemaker Unity (Sulzer Intermedics).	0.9976862969360518
The impedance changes between implantation and 6 months follow-up were assessed for each patient.	1.1265802414165624
Similar impedance values were defined, if the two measurements were within a range <= -100 to +100 .	1.278246098856285
Six-months impedance was lower or higher compared to implantation, if the difference exceeded > -100 or > +100 .	1.2095802153791892
At implantation, impedance was 535  +/-  98  (range: 333-811 ) and significantly increased to 604  +/-  160  (range: 361-1150 ) after 6 months.	1.2906985566604205
Mean difference between the two measurements was 69  +/-  162  (range: -336 bis +560 ).	1.3011279849076665
Similar impedance had 43 (implantation: 527  +/-  75 , 6 months: 531  +/-  87 ), lower values 11 (implantation: 660  +/-  83 , 6 months: 494  +/-  73 ) and higher values 33 patients (implantation: 503  +/-  99 , 6 months: 735  +/-  168 ).	1.255887025799481
Compared to the patients with similar impedance patients with lower impedance had a significantly higher impedance values at implantation.	1.1518629395940796
Conclusions: Pacing impedance increased significantly within 6 months after implantation.	1.074034701166088
Pacing impedance changed > 100  in 51% of the patients.	1.0163571037650854
The long-term follow-up of pacing impedance can be predicted generally, but not for the individual patient.	1.2155345661201744
Endothelin has both vasoconstrictor and mitogenic properties and might, therefore, play a role in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes and coronary atherosclerosis.	0.9554784335859364
The aim of the study was to characterize the mechanisms and kinetics of cardiac endothelin-1 (ET-1) release following a local endothelial injury during PTCA (group A) and after sustained myocardial ischemia (group B).	1.1825771015375295
Additionally, the precision of agreement between measurements in coronary sinus and peripheral venous samples should be analyzed.	0.9547178056212859
Since first described in the early 1990s, coronary magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has evolved as a promising noninvasive modality for imaging of the coronary arteries and evaluation of coronary artery disease.	1.2460461566656633
Despite technical limitations, coronary MRA has established value for imaging of anomalous coronary artery and assessment of bypass graft patency.	0.987242695916163
Current research focuses on the development of optimal respiratory compensation strategies, improved spatial and temporal resolution and faster acquisition of image data.	0.8571947148400574
The accurate detection of stenoses and assessment of the severity of coronary atherosclerosis is presently being evaluated with large multicenter studies.	1.024787172343767
With further technique enhancements and more clinical experience, coronary MRA is likely to become the dominant noninvasive modality in clinical cardiology.	0.89393067654476
Which consequences can be ascribed to the intraarticular position of devices in the operative treatment of a slipped capital femoral epiphysis?	0.9241528620650258
Which steps are to define as a standard of a careful procedure?	1.0765994764178837
A digitised three-dimensional (3-D) image of the face has many valuable uses.	1.2337652503189833
These include accurate measurements of facial morphology, clinical documentation and objective analyses of surgical procedures.	1.0155735134704833
A new system presented here, based on stereophotogrammetric techniques, instantaneously captures digitised images using high-resolution cameras.	0.8999115495875304
It has an accuracy of more than 0.5 mm RMS and creates the 3-D image from approximately 20,000 points.	1.0521722406717435
The principles of the image capturing are demonstrated and the potential uses discussed.	0.9602170473212777
Surgical changes of the soft tissue in two patients following orthognathic surgery are also illustrated.	1.0404314269391397
This new capturing and measurement system provides a simple method of determining 3-D changes in soft tissue following surgery and is a useful tool for clinical purposes.	1.0731710226497677
A potential impact of tricyclic antidepressants on oral anticoagulation is controversial.	0.7009769071754813
Phenprocoumon - the most commonly used anticoagulant in Germany - is rarely considered in clinical trials.	1.452252680297071
In the present study, a potential drug-drug interaction between phenprocoumon and tricyclics, causing an alteration in prothrombinemic effects, has been investigated.	1.1417746803762694
To analyse the possible injuries of vertebral segments, especially the disc, after unstable thoracolumbar fractures stabilised with AO internal fixator, we performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the traumatised region after implant removal.	1.209976983048408
There were two aspects of disc degeneration (DD): (1) biochemical changes and (2) structural damage.	1.0337112514027842
MRI detects biochemical processes as one aspect of DD that is often small even in the presence of greater structural damage of the nucleus pulposus caused by fracture.	0.915879501406395
None of the patients presented with structural failure of the anulus fibrosus, which is the essential structural component of the vertebral segments with regard to stability.	1.2579434724064205
We observed biochemical changes more often in the lower of the two fracture-adjacent discs and alterations of discal shape more often in the upper of the two, whereas loss of height concerned both discs to approximately the same degree.	1.2344653596101571
The supporters of upper-disc resection in thoracolumbar fractures justify their procedure among other things with the structural disc damage, such as alteration of shape and loss of height (altogether more frequent in the upper disc).	0.9964786743592896
Our observations that a disc with a structurally altered nucleus pulposus can be biochemically intact and can show an intact anulus fibrosus are arguments in favour of disc preservation.	0.8831807746760062
With regard to the upper disc, the widespread opinion that complete and regular disc damage requires a resection has to be revised.	1.1525211828544246
The question of whether the lower disc should be resected more often because of its greater biochemical changes cannot be answered by the present study alone.	1.138820078617324
Besides the excellent static information in all anatomical structures of the vertebral column available by MRI, a repeat examination in a prone position yields dynamic information on the spinal cord in the case of suspected dorsal adhesions.	1.119222706594845
To study the frequency and clinical aspects of cold urticaria in Central Europe, patient data from a university dermatology clinic and a private dermatology office between 1984-94 were analysed and the patients reexamined if possible.	1.0522559743309516
The incidence of cold urticaria was found to be 0.05%.	1.0896638829965923
Of the 56 patients with cold urticaria (31 women, 25 men), 49 had idiopathic cold urticaria.	1.1500294951135632
The mean age was 41.0 +/- 15.6 year, the mean duration of disease 7.9 +/- 5.8 years.	1.2428516344978637
Atopy was found in 46.5% of patients, and 23.2% of the patients suffered from other types of urticaria (cholinergic, chronic idiopathic, dermographic, aquagenic and heat-induced).	1.0854786131128902
Laboratory examinations were only rarely abnormal.	0.7149098201041626
44 patients were treated with antihistamines, with generally only moderate symptomatic improvement.	1.0250532846096179
Treatment with antibiotics (penicillin, 1-2 mil IU/d over 2-4 weeks, n=18, or tetracyclines, 2 g/d over 2 weeks, n=10) induced full remission in 13 patients and symptomatic improvement in 8.	1.1078832402058532
During an average of 6.5 year-follow-up, 20 of 43 symptomatic patients went into spontaneous remission.	1.109832572854369
The good therapeutic response to antibiotics in this study underlines the need for a better elucidation of the cause of cold urticaria, in view of possible infectious causes.	1.1964320007368645
Background: Since its first implantation as an eyeball replacement in the United States in 1985, hydroxyapatite has been rarely used as an orbital implant in Germany.	1.1046762446624725
The aim of the study was to collect data on long-term tolerance, postoperative complications and the cosmetic end results.	1.016099268039452
A 37-year-old woman had intensive care for 105 days and artificial ventilation for 72 days because of a lung transplantation and multiple postoperative complications.	1.0446970516325778
She developed severe heterotopic ossification of both shoulders, the right elbow and both hip joints.	1.0612394847361
Owing to complete joint stiffness, she was immobilized and unable to eat or drink without help.	0.7680148994093049
Operative treatment was performed in two procedures.	0.9912646700459808
The right shoulder and right elbow were operated on first; the right hip and later the left hip were operated on after recovery from the previous surgical procedures.	1.1075020041252501
After 22 months, there was a good functional result; the patient took part in all activities of daily life and was pain-free.	1.244801316188302
The present knowledge on heterotopic ossifications is summarized, as well as possible prophylactic measurements.	0.9762339788415585
Background: Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) is one of the most common forms of supraventricular tachycardia in the pediatric population.	1.1645833368529834
Patients and methods: 41 children with a mean age of 9.6 (3.7-16) years with recurrent atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) refractory to medical treatment (n=38) and recurrent syncope (n=3) underwent electrophysiologic (EP) study.	1.189995957268007
In all patients dual AV-nodal physiology could be demonstrated during EP study and typical form of AVNRT (mean heart rate 220/min) could be induced by programmed atrial stimulation.	1.1073062819725819
A steerable 7 F ablation catheter was placed at the inferoparaseptal region of the tricupid valve annulus close to the orifice of the coronary sinus with the intention to record a late fractionated local atrial electrogram during sinus rhythm.	0.9834137449858813
Starting at this point radiofrequency current (500 kHz) with a target temperature of 70 °C was delivered with the intention to ablate the slow pathway.	1.0007939218570312
If a slowly accelerated junctional rhythm (<120/min) occurred during energy discharge, programmed atrial stimulation was repeated.	1.043383977543364
Otherwise radiofrequency current was delivered step by step up to a septal position next to the tricuspid valve annulus.	0.8582928935049392
Slow pathway ablation was defined as lack of evidence of dual AV nodal pathways during repeated atrial stimulation.	0.8591814149947121
Slow pathway modulation was defined as maximal one atrial echoimpulse after ablation.	0.7326647669844291
Results: The number of energy applications ranged from 1-19 (median 6).	1.1488052376781597
In 35/41 patients slow pathway ablation could be achieved; in six patients the slow pathway was modulated.	1.00042107828781
In none of the patients permanent high grade AV block was observed.	1.0351416247519565
During follow-up (mean 4.1 years) two patients had a recurrent episode of AVNRT after slow pathway modulation.	1.2593626649289051
All other patients are still free of AVNRT without medical treatment.	0.9256135072619983
Conclusion: Selective radiofrequency current ablation/modulation of the slow pathway is a safe and curative treatment of AVNRT in young patients.	1.065801431839585
Since we had the impression that there was an increase in blood loss during mammaplasties after a change in the anesthesiology department responsible, we conducted a study to compare 28 cases from each anesthesiology department.	1.1747049881531317
All operations were carried out by the first author in succession using the same operative technique.	1.0615086036809496
The two groups did not differ in age, BMI, operative time, weight of resected tissue or preoperative laboratory.	1.1913226395661247
Blood loss was calculated from the perioperative drop in hemoglobin and patient's blood volume.	0.9153535081406989
Blood pressure, heart rate, medication and intravenous fluid supply were obtained from the anesthetic protocols.	0.7849890624915714
Results (means and standard deviations): Group I (n = 28) and [Group II (n = 28)]: total resected tissue 1862  +/-  928 g [1912  +/-  791 g]; Hb-preop.	1.1267777444560236
13.6  +/-  0.9 g/dl [13.8  +/-  0.8 g/dl]; Hb-postop.	1.1550576739397793
10.8  +/-  1.3 g/dl [9.7  +/-  1.3 g/dl] P = 0.006; Blood loss 970  +/-  339 ml [1443  +/-  456 ml] P < 0.001.	1.0913483640849202
After exclusion of surgical or biological causes hemodynamic effects of the anesthetic techniques were suspected as the reason for the significant difference in blood loss.	1.10195506240919
MAP was elevated only initially, while the heart rate was considerably elevated throughout the procedures in group II.	1.2782889621780926
During anesthesia with nitrous oxide and enflurane, the dose of enflurane in group I could be limited to 0.3-0.5 % after initial i. v. administration of 60 to 100 µg sufentanil, while in group II without opioids doses of 0.5-2 % were required.	1.3460114851931393
The well-known dose-dependend effect of enflurane on the peripheral vascular tone was not masked by vasoconstrictors at the operative site.	0.9170791447487558
Conclusions: Blood loss during mammaplasties can be affected considerably by the anaesthetic technique - even without deliberate hypotension.	1.2623909805529256
Sufentanil can indirectly reduce the blood loss by lowering the necessary dose of enflurane.	1.0041724427202994
Blood transfusions can be avoided at mammaplasties.	0.9424428074796511
Continuous epidural infusion of bupivacaine with the opioid fentanyl represents an effective analgesic method in the therapy of strong postoperative pain after major surgery.	1.0228204169759454
Preparation of the required infusion solution in syringes with a volume of 50 ml immediately prior to administration is routinely performed by nursing staff in Germany.	0.8942048735815726
The effort required for the preparation is associated with logistical and pharmaceutical difficulties.	0.8398589221471777
The preparation of a mixture of bupivacaine hydrochloride 0.06% and fentanyl 0.0002% in 250 ml infusion bags at the pharmacy of the University Hospital Mainz is described.	0.9850155699144013
To determine the physicochemical stability, the concentration of bupivacaine-HCl and fentanyl was assessed using HPLC over a period of 32 days; in addition the pH values were determined.	1.0596126671422368
After 32 days 95% of the bupivacaine hydrochloride and fentanyl baseline values were recorded.	1.0531624335955527
The pH baseline value had decreased from 5.48-5.52 to 0.5-0.7 units.	1.2252642211821059
The measured values confirm the physicochemical stability of the mixture of bupivacaine hydrochloride 0.06% and fentanyl 0.0002% over a period of 32 days.	0.8180096552307071
The infusion bag can be stored for 4 weeks at room temperature.	0.747978995461603
The programming of a cochlear implant speech processor used by young children is often difficult, especially when the stimulus level associated with maximum auditory loudness (MAL) needs to be determined.	0.9341167607584946
Excessively high stimulation should be avoided as this can have a traumatic effect.	0.9713899425728781
The aim of this study was to determine if a relationship exists between the intraoperatively determined electrical stapedius reflex threshold (ESRT) and the postoperatively determined MAL and hearing threshold for 27 patients, each having one of three implant types.	1.1077780736670193
The question of whether the ESRT provides a practical technique to simplify, improve and accelerate speech processor programming was investigated.	0.8879804977749385
For the monopolar stimulation mode used for the Med-El and Clarion implant systems, the average MAL and threshold was expressed as a percentage of the average ESRT across all electrodes.	1.0083939436015856
For the "common ground" stimulation mode used for the Nucleus implant system, a parabolic transformation was used to relate MAL and ESRT to one another.	1.0176410025111302
These transformations between MAL values calculated from the ESRT and the actual MAL values, determined psychoacoustically, diverged considerably from one another.	0.9170449986470802
Therefore, it was not possible to determine the MAL from the ESRT with certainty.	1.2452239708840147
The ESRT does, however, provide a means to estimate an approximate upper boundary for the MAL, apart from its use to control implant function.	1.0528862808764319
The determination of the exact MAL will still need to be determined using behavioural techniques.	0.9472159923519078
Movements and vibrations of intraocular structures can be observed during vitrectomy with mechanical cutting systems.	0.871510472852265
We experimentally compared these intraocular motion artifacts between mechanical and erbium:YAG laser vitrectomy.	0.7299722914169755
Spontaneous rupture und false aneurysms of the non-arteriosclerotic aorta are rare.	0.6725391557511254
We report on a 53-year-old patient with false aneurysm due to covered rupture of the thoraco abdominal aorta following sarcoidosis initially repaired by semicircumferential aortic end-to-end anastomosis.	0.9853368520030799
After 6 months local recurrence occurred and the afflicted aorta was replaced by autologous arterial graft, transferring the right iliac artery as aortic patch.	0.9235672306667403
The iliac reconstruction was performed by PTFE interposition.	0.8901709960494887
There was no specific therapy for sarcoidosis.	0.9623876757676056
At 1 year follow-up there was no recurrence and the patient is free of symptoms.	1.2709122104398498
In this biomechanical study the implanted Unreamed Humeral Nail (UHN) has been tested concerning bending and torsional stiffnesses.	0.9300431785823531
In literature other intramedullary implants have been critisized for insufficient rotatory stability especially in transverse and short oblique fractures of the humeral shaft.	0.9151358983410058
This study examined, whether the implanted UHN, as well as the UHN implanted with interfragmentary compression through a specific compression device, is able to augment torsional stiffness significantly.	1.0710262943152145
To evaluate bending and torsional stiffnesses, the UHN has been compared biomechanically to the Russell-Taylor humeral nail (RT) in paired mid-shaft osteotomized cadaveric humeri.	1.0073699866366166
Identic paired comparison has been performed with the UHN without and UHN with interfragmentary compression.	0.8676325172669673
In anterior-posterior, as well as medio-lateral direction stiffness under four-point-bending is significantly higher in stabilizing with the RT.	0.7844458054478093
Under torsional loading with moments of 4 Nm, 6 Nm and 8 Nm the UHN reached more than the double torsional stiffness.	0.8595115154237891
The RT, which is only dynamically interlocked, owns a high initial "play" between bolts and nail itself.	1.0620345808897458
Through additional interfragmentary compression stiffness of the UHN under four-point-bending in anterior-posterior, as well as medio-lateral direction augments significantly.	0.695083852399455
Also under torsional loading with moments of 4 Nm, 6 Nm und 8 Nm torsional stiffness increases with interfragmentary compression significantly.	0.7491930134361451
In comparison to other biomechanical studies of different autorship it is clear, that this statically interlocked intramedullary nailing of the humeral shaft is superior to non-statically interlocked types of nailing concerning their stabilizing potency in torsion and serves especially for fracture types, which are critically under rotation, as transverse or short oblique humeral shaft fractures.	1.0845187965925447
While the different national health systems merge structurally, cost expansion in health care is a global challenge.	0.9420603536141015
Structural reforms have been developed during recent years in the USA which can be summarized as "managed care".	1.0365734824603912
They are characterized by the evolution of an economically orientated system, in which units of medical therapy are generally handled like conventional economical goods.	1.0920116913991451
In managed-care models, patients are deliberately directed to the most economic forms of therapy.	1.0951475191190916
The spectrum of medical interventions as well as diagnostic or therapeutic patterns are predefined by a system of contracted guidelines, which lead to a standardization of processes.	1.0605698250656737
Financing and medical executive responsibilities fuse.	0.5871916031282585
The autonomy of medical decisions is clearly reduced to enforce an integrated and economically oriented steering of the health system.	0.8840784912819828
Leadership is no longer primarily confined to doctors or scientists.	0.8386834191901343
It is progressively shifting to financing institutions, managing directors or insurance companies.	0.6486923047674388
Structural changes currently are expanding rapidly in the U. S. and have meanwhile led to marked regional reductions of medical costs.	0.8842803404805721
Nevertheless, the US model is still far more expensive compared to the German system.	1.1989177157152593
Historical development, current concepts of US-managed care, its potential influence and general applicability to the German situation are discussed in an overview.	1.095845258219361
On the subject of natriuretic peptides there is a great deal of controversy, and intensive research efforts have been made studying their effects on electrolyte homeostasis.	1.1774082445267695
In the early 1980s, a peptide that caused diuresis, natriuresis, and had a relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle was discovered independently by several groups.	1.156113590731938
This was the breakthrough for the identification of natriuretic peptides, followed by the characterisation of the amino-acid sequences of several species.	0.8733707455466935
Synthesis of the peptide, cloning of the encoding gene, identification and characterisation of specific receptors, as well as the development of antibodies and radioimmunoassays were rapidly accomplished.	0.9621358494410391
Research on the immunohistochemistry of cardiodilatin/atrial natriuretic peptide (CDD/ANP) and the regulation of CDD/ANP gene expression led to detection of the peptide in extra-atrial tissues.	1.0855793515820944
Later on, two new peptides were discovered brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP).	0.9718985282350843
These peptides share structural features with CDD/ANP with regard to their 17-amino-acid-exhibiting loop bridged by a disulfide bond.	0.8533285906476699
Another recently discovered peptide is urodilatin (URO), a renal-borne new member of A-type natriuretic peptide.	1.0370157511531504
URO was isolated from human urine and consists of the same sequence as CDD/ANP, containing the 17-amino-acid residue loop of the circulating hormone with 4 additional amino acids located at the NH2-terminus of the peptide.	0.9414709885485103
Regarding physiological actions, data strongly support a close association between URO and urinary sodium excretion.	0.9247287421174707
The application of URO in animals revealed a stronger diuresis and natriuresis with a lower influence on arterial blood pressure compared to CDD/ANP-99-126.	0.9019440711881744
These results were encouraging for the use of URO in clinical trials as a tool to prevent acute renal failure (ARF) in patients following heart transplantation and for treatment of incipient ARF in patients following liver transplantation.	1.1690199737916245
Summarising the results of these two studies, URO represents a new approach for not only prevention, but also for treatment of ARF following organ transplantation.	1.2057006352855637
This opens up new possibilities for the treatment of ARF of other origins in intensive care medicine.	0.7975562636102842
Dermatomyositis in a 7 year old girl was diagnosed two months prior to admission to our pediatric rheumatology program.	1.017891386663085
Serological and molecular biology methods were used to investigate the evidence for a recent coxsackie-B-virusinfection.	1.1103768296381793
Objectives Wide approach to the posterior aspect of the scapula for internal fixation of unstable fractures of neck of scapula and glenoid.	1.0172426216098316
The guideline "Joint Swelling" is addressed to primary care physicians - general practitioners, internists or orthopedists without special experience in rheumatology.	1.0513259910117185
It provides a framework for interviewing patients, as well as for physical, laboratory and imaging examinations and for selection of treatment appropriate to the level of primary care.	1.0736223144862582
Situations which call for urgent evaluation and criteria for referral to rheumatologists are described.	0.7412153816493742
The appendix contains comments on signs and symptoms to differentiate arthralgia from joint swelling and on the diagnostic value of a history of joint swelling without confirmation by the physician.	1.0057191630590079
Further recommendations for the evaluation of patient history and physical and technical examinations are given in a tabular form.	1.0271047633897816
The significance of laboratory and imaging procedures is discussed.	0.8243922194388832
Introduction: Bile duct complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy occur twice to three times more frequently than after an open procedure.	1.0449898043852515
Four different types of lesions may be differentiated by the Siewert classification: postoperative bile fistulas (type I), late strictures (type II), tangential injuries of the bile duct (type III) and defect lesions (type IV).	1.1352546815194655
The diagnostic and therapeutic management is demonstrated in relation to our own experience and the literature.	1.1518887562288218
Methods: Eleven patients (median age 43.8  +/-  17.2) with bile duct complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy were operatively treated between November 1993 and December 1998.	1.1750310306409506
Nine patients (four type-II lesions, five type-IV lesions) were referred from another hospital; 2 defect lesions out of 410 laparoscopic cholecystectomies (0.5 %) were documented in our own patient group.	1.144724657488718
Results: Four patients with late strictures were operatively treated with a hepaticocholedochostomy (n = 2) or hepaticojejunostomy (n = 2) after 14.3  +/-  8.4 months and were discharged from hospital after 10.6  +/-  3.8 days.	1.2935616265860805
In both cases with type-IV lesion and a short defect, an end-to-end anastomosis was successful (hospital stay 11.6  +/-  1.0 days).	1.119383549140075
However, a retrocolic Roux-Y end-to-side hepaticojejunostomy was perfomed in all cases with a larger defect (n = 5; hospital stay 14.8  +/-  2.0 days).	1.196135685347489
The two defect lesions in our own group were detected by intraoperative cholangiography and immediately treated after conversion either with hepaticocholedocho-stomy or hepaticojejunostomy (hospital stay 11.2  +/-  0.6 days).	1.0090716652251617
Conclusions: The incidence of bile duct complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy might be kept down by anatomic preparation, selective intraoperative cholangiography and early consideration of conversion to open procedure.	0.8812510985858651
The clinical course after biliary tract injury can be positively influenced only by a standard diagnostic and operative procedure and by an early transfer to a specialized center.	1.1327786922023224
In the last years the incidence of renal cell carcinoma diagnosis increased about 15-20 %.	1.012036751705367
The main aim of this study was to analyse the reason of the increase of incidence.	0.9685735353460946
In the present autopsy series comprising 23.801 autopsies the percentage of patients who died of renal cell carcinoma is 1,77 % in Jena and 1,55 % in Königgrätz (200.000 inhabitants each).	1.3141036977527956
Over this time the incidence of renal cell carcinoma in autopsies has increased.	0.9333552982243036
With the advent of atypical antipsychotics, quality of life for patients with schizophrenia has improved significantly.	1.0205817082771051
The positive effects are based not only on the compliance-enhancing reduction of extrapyramidal side effects but also due to improved cognitive function and social integration, shorter duration, and overall reduction of hospital treatment.	1.0555245760680905
The mortality of perioperative myocardial infarction is still high and according to recently published data amounts to 17 to 42%.	0.9894712554399391
In the seventies introduction of thrombolytic therapy has led to a dramatic reduction in mortality of non-perioperative myocardial infarction.	0.8772932639390502
However, in the perioperative situation thrombolytic therapy remains to be problematic in most cases because of expected severe bleeding complications.	1.2140913522386574
In the last 4-6 years acute-PTCA has been established in the therapy of acute myocardial infarction.	1.1088387041255618
Up to date no data are available concerning the effect of acute-PTCA on mortality of perioperative myocardial infarction.	0.8669232328363201
Nevertheless it can be assumed, that acute-PTCA will lead to a considerable reduction in mortality of perioperative myocardial infarction.	1.0375096051167227
Therefore, in patients with significant perioperative myocardial infarction immediate coronary angiography and, if indicated, acute-PTCA should be performed.	1.2797156116415056
In principle, thrombolytic therapy is considered to be contraindicated in the intra- or postoperative situation.	1.0278115619252213
However, if coronary angiography and PTCA are not possible, thrombolysis might be taken into consideration, in particular if the expected bleeding complications are small in relation to the expected benefit of thrombolysis.	1.3202098595848326
Since acute-PTCA has been shown to remarkably reduce mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock after acute myocardial infarction, this group of patients should be especially considered.	1.045912106830486
Medical theories and practices concerning illness and health in old age as well as several aspects of society that do influence the aging process are described from a historical perspective integrating classical antiquity, middle ages, and modern times.	0.9858343609208525
From the present state of research it is distinguished between "primary illnesses in old age" and chronical diseases which might principally also begin in younger ages but take a different course in old age.	1.0275860179542295
Even if the frequency of disease and multimorbidity is increasing, negative stereotypes of the aging process have to be invalidated.	1.0843934785392293
Advances in medical sciences are a good pre-condition for increasing physical and mental health in old age.	0.8869257441112639
The analysis of wall motion abnormalities with dobutamine stress echocardiography is an established method for the detection of myocardial ischemia.	0.9475901677065072
With ultrafast magnetic resonance tomography, the application of identical stress protocols as used for echocardiography is possible.	0.94077676992211
Transvaginal ultrasound provides an early and accurate technique to assess first trimester pregnancy.	0.8969486091538823
Beginning with the demonstration of an intrauterine gestational sac, sonography enables further evaluation of normal pregnancy development, such as identification of the embryo, visualization of the yolk sac, and the presence of fetal cardiac activity as a reassurance of fetal viability.	1.0932266178864634
Furthermore it allows closed sonographic monitoring of early intrauterine pregnancy and distinction between normal and abnormal development of pregnancy.	0.8842055240399365
A prediction in terms of pregnancy outcome can be made regarding pregnancy complications or specific risks like vaginal bleeding, the demonstration of intrauterine hematoma, advanced maternal age, early growth delay or fetal bradycardia.	1.0347476965544835
Because of the marked heterogeneity of patient groups and the diverse causes of obstruction, surgical therapy of the small-bowel ileus is difficult to standardize.	1.1709539048659976
A homogeneous strategy of intraoperative handling of the obstructed bowel (decompression, endoluminal splinting) as well as abdominal closure would be desirable.	0.8697966045502932
Adhesiolysis remains the most common procedure.	1.1081881491523031
Small bowel plication is still used by a minority of surgeons with the Noble's technique replaced by the Child-Phillips' technique and its modifications.	0.9138485564992406
However, as a result of the lack of controlled studies, there is no large body of evidence available to support the use of plication, long tubes or any other specific surgical intervention.	1.1930532541234602
This is an important task for the future, especially in view of incidence and economic importance of small bowel-ileus.	1.2331214551285645
Purpose: The purpose of our study was to determine the value of MRI in monitoring laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy (LITT) of cerebral neoplasms.	0.9607347605448091
A 70-year-old woman with severely symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy was unresponsive to drug treatment.	0.7924349593374627
She had recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias and syncope and was at high risk for sudden death; a dual chamber pacemaker defibrillator (DDD-ICS) was implanted.	1.0392525541472286
Her initial left ventricular outflow tract gradient was 80 mmHg and fell to 40 mmHg during dual-chamber pacing at an atrial ventricular delay of 140 ms.	0.9172089312033781
In the follow-up over six months she was asymptomatic with respect to angina pectoris; ventricular tachycardias could be successfully terminated by antitachycardia pacing or by shocks.	0.9410470689906834
A dual chamber pacemaker defibrillator is an important therapeutic option for patients with symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and ventricular tachyarrhythmias.	0.9484992369282288
Morbihan's disease was first reported as a distinct entity in 1957 by Degos, describing a chronic persistent erythema and oedema of the upper half of the face.	1.0553344181094588
Such conditions have been noted in the literature designated as chronic lymphoedema or solid persistent facial oedema in acne or rosacea.	0.9524213281787216
The characteristic features are a chronic course, a typical clinical picture, lack of specific laboratory and histological findings and refractoriness to therapeutic measures.	1.166508840929529
Paediatric cardiac transplantation (pHTX) has gained widespread acceptance as a therapy in end-stage myocardial failure and some forms of congenital heart disease, particularly hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS).	0.976147462189022
The major problems to the anaesthesiologist in these patients are induction of anaesthesia in infants with HLHS and treatment of pulmonary hypertension in the early post-bypass period.	1.3536672986373566
Objective: Thirty years ago, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was primarily developed for otherwise healthy individuals who experienced sudden cardiac arrest.	1.0042845699613927
Today, CPR is widely viewed as an emergency procedure that can be attempted on any person who undergoes a cessation of cardiorespiratory function.	0.9470693193426594
Therefore, the appropriateness of CPR has been questioned as a matter of the outcome, the patient's preferences, and the cost.	1.4361778274132317
The objective of this article is to analyse ethical issues in prehospital resuscitation.	0.9366294838885111
Arguments: CPR is bound by moral considerations that surround the use of any medical treatment.	0.9216924226152194
According to Beauchamp and Childress, the hierarchy of justification in biomedical ethics consists of ethical theories, principles, rules, and particular judgements and actions.	0.9679418948720108
The decision to start CPR is based on the medical judgement that a person is suffering from circulatory arrest.	1.0242615503815669
The decision is justified by the moral rule that the victim of a cardiac arrest has the right to survive and to receive CPR.	1.0680295318032644
Moral rules are more specific to contexts and are based on ethical principles.	0.8806278888646324
The principle of beneficence means the provision of benefits for the promotion of welfare.	0.7399139313539617
Talking about beneficence in resuscitation means once again reporting stories of success, as many victims of pre- and in-hospital sudden death have been saved in the past.	1.1377724416099342
Nevertheless, resuscitative efforts still remain unsuccessful in the majority of cases, involving the principle of nonmaleficence.	1.0369080827860266
There is potential harm in CPR.	0.540187319006227
Survivors may recover cardiac function, but sustain severe hypoxic brain damage, at worst surviving without awakening for months or years.	0.9981158381327744
In particular, post-traumatic CPR is associated with an extremely poor outcome, leading to the issue of futility.	1.0761942345312794
However, futility should be defined in a strict fashion, as there might be an individual chance of survival.	1.2801534812441304
The principle of respect for autonomy means the right of a patient to accept or reject medical treatment, which continues in emergency conditions and after the patient has lost consciousness.	1.2142500836659005
The time frame in CPR requires medical decision-making within seconds, and CPR is usually initiated without the patient's involvement.	1.0330844084693116
If the patient's wish's can be ascertained later on, life-sustaining therapies might be withdrawn at that time.	0.9416949655030106
Terminally ill but still competent patients should be encouraged to write a no-CPR document, which does not deny patients relief from severe symptoms, but might facilitate withholding resuscitative efforts at the scene.	1.0090652009755023
The principle of justice affects priorities in the allocation of health care resources.	0.7541977678815887
The decision made for a particular patient might delay or prevent emergency treatment in other patients who could receive greater benefit.	0.9904446129457696
Conclusions: The standard of care remains the prompt initiation of CPR.	1.1167239194679446
However, ethical principles such as beneficene, nonmaleficence, autonomy, and justice have to be applied in the unique setting of emergency medicine.	1.2308145851370325
Physicians have to consider the therapeutic efficacy of CPR, the potential risks, and the patient's preferences.	1.4031844571835526
Acting within the context of the therapeutic process is often equated with acting-out.	1.0612892798088511
Subtile behaviour, too, as a part of the "complex system of sending and receiving unconscious signals" (Sandler) which serve for the patient to induce behavior of the transference object in the analyst or fulfilling his unconscious wishes is seen as acting-out or microacting-out (Treuniet).	1.1180358733740192
However, this delicate acting has no meaning, it is not symbolic or communicative action.	1.196671117542719
It is aimed at inducing effects and interactions.	0.6090605887213189
It appears both on the side of the analyst and of the patient and is part of the unconscious communication in the therapeutic process.	1.2100230274715935
Diverse interactive means and ways will be demonstrated, how the analyst is moved to unnoticed acting and to handling the patient in an unnoticed manner in a certain way.	1.0113338044140845
The acting-reactions of the analyst may have the character of interpretations, by which he unintentionally demonstrates, in what a way he understands the patient.	1.1081417502636008
Background: The therapy of phimosis is circumcision.	1.1099485019351243
Since many years it has been discussed, whether phimosis is treatable with local estrogen application analogous to the treatment of labial synechia in girls.	1.0340303001535829
This conservative treatment depends on the presence of estrogen receptors (er-alpha) in male prepuce-cells.	0.9962945088661085
Findings in previous investigations have indicated that contrast-enhanced colour Doppler can be used to improve the demonstration of characteristic features of neovascularization in malignancies.	0.9195949090831138
However, the quantification of the increase in colour Doppler signals after Levovist in the cited study relied only on descriptive criteria defined by the investigator, resulting in a subjective scoring system.	1.0344596009503704
A computer-assisted method for quantitative analysis of colour pixel density is a novel approach for objective assessment of colour Doppler signal after contrast media administration.	0.9989351809530355
After microbubble contrast medium injection in 47 patients, carcinomas and benign lesions behaved differently regarding degree, onset and duration of Doppler enhancement.	0.9137274172502236
However, the high interindividual variability and the temporal variations of the Doppler signal still limit the value of these criteria for prospective diagnosis.	1.1468175060257932
Rapid image-acquisition techniques are needed in order to apply the necessary mathematical processing before the contrast kinetics can be used for diagnostic purposes.	1.0679692158206453
Recent studies have shown that increased intraocular pressure following keratoplasty may cause progressive endothelial cell loss and thereby lead to early transplant failure.	0.8385437829037142
This study examined risk groups for development of postoperative glaucoma and thereby transplant failure.	0.900410516782303
Dysphagia is a common complaint following surgical intervention in the oral cavity and hypopharynx, often leading to prolonged postoperative recovery.	1.09237261826526
Videofluoroscopy allows detailed visualization of deglutition, demonstrating the morphology as well as the functional aspects.	1.1301840038179032
Therefore, videofluoroscopy provides the basis for further therapeutic management.	1.2844857140596124
We discuss the pathology of deglutition in 19 patients recovering from tumor surgery of the oro- and hypopharynx.	0.9827013453407338
In most cases the results demonstrated severe impairment of both the oral and pharyngeal phase of deglutition.	1.1403320981510998
Our data emphasize the importance of the oral phase of deglutition for preparation and initiation of the following phases.	1.1439214169906786
People who suffer a stroke most often experience a major crisis in their lives.	0.86022670017567
This leads to psychological problems which are likely to influence the patient's life satisfaction, long-term rehabilitation outcome, and quality of life as much as the physical consequences caused by the stroke.	1.0894614340065574
The patient's ability to accept the new reality created by a disability as a part of their future life is therefore essential.	1.013663205687011
This necessitates an individual coping strategy in the center of which is a mourning process, which unfolds in the same way as other experiences of vital threat, e.g.	1.0525956378592516
confrontation with one's own dying.	0.7352382505432261
Different stages of mourning that can also be found in stroke patients are nonacceptance of the facts, erupting emotions, parting with the former and finding of a new self as well as new perspectives for one's future.	1.0275452291591638
Whether a coping process is successful does not depend on the type of the defense mechanisms or stages, but essentially on their persistence.	0.9954953933491848
It is the task of the therapeutical team to support this process by applying a basic therapeutic behavior, stage-consistent interventions and a positive feedback.	1.1459069489565534
A failed process of coping may be one of the causes of the high prevalence of psychological disorders like depression and anxiety disorders in patients having sufferd a stroke.	1.1208905035535472
A 63-year-old woman developed a pruritic exanthema on the extremities after one hour of work in her garden pond in Planegg, Southern Bavaria.	0.9573873796746555
As the appropriate vectors (ducks and snails) were present, we made the tentative diagnosis of cercarial dermatitis (swimmer's itch).	0.9925506071228739
By different serological methods (cercarial fluorescent antibody test, cercarial Hüllen reaction, circumoval precipitin test) antibodies against cercariae could be demonstrated in the serum of the patient 14 days later.	0.9817542499659406
Cercarial dermatitis appears worldwide, but in Central Europe the disease is often not recognized.	1.2892062781185847
The current adjustment of cochlear implant (CI) speech processors is based on a knowledge of the lower and upper limits (T- and C-levels) for electrical stimulus currents.	1.1410428165104871
These data are usually acquired from subjective classifications of individual patients.	0.8797516847689022
In cases with non-reliable patient responses, objective methods are necessary.	0.7179962750098519
Especially for the estimation of correct T-levels, auditory evoked potentials (AEP) can be applied, since they allow the determination of response thresholds in a frequency-specific manner.	1.0773366204905181
By determining the AEP of different latencies, late cortical responses can be registered almost without artifact contamination.	0.8726981442012978
These patients have been examined in 20 patients provided with 22- or 8-channel CI-systems (Nucleus or Med-El implants).	1.0243899606730984
In all cases, clear responses and clearly discernible threshold transitions could be detected.	0.7937365809172148
By making use of acoustical stimulation in a free sound field, subjective hearing threshold and the T-levels of electrical stimulation could be verified.	0.9591599324880932
Since late responses are generated in the primary auditory cortex, their assessment permits a nearly integral functional control of the aided hearing system.	0.9734549468200205
To date, no problems have occured from maturation or attentional effects in either pediatric or adult patients.	0.9622764065738005
The applicability in very young children remains to be explored.	0.7093254080521345
Laparoscopic gastric banding has become a common procedure in bariatric surgery.	0.8961239572183796
Early as well as late complications are, in comparison to conventional techniques, rare.	1.0996339069005039
Complications arising from the operative technique are: perforation, early pouch dilatation, gastric slippage, infections of the port and the band, erosion and defects of the band tube.	1.048330320125608
Insufficient weight loss and late pouch dilatation arise from unsatisfactory compliance on the part of the patient.	0.8087391375517262
In 7.5 % of 146 cases, reoperations were necessary.	1.121741115549464
Obstruction of the pouch stoma and a slippage resulted in total food intolerance.	0.8363224109462993
After radiologic diagnosis the band system should be deflated first and a naso-gastric tube applied.	0.7366766422103121
If this does not result in the pouch collapsing, a revision operation is needed.	1.0560193716399957
The significant legal and ecomonic ramifications of a positive drug test produce an incentive among users of illicit drugs to escape detection.	0.8177427251306094
Therefore, being the easiest body fluid to handle for drug screening urine is very often manipulated to test clean.	1.0948068198450498
Methods available to cause a negative result range from substitution of urine, adulteration of the collected specimen by various chemical agents and in-vivo manipulations.	0.9838328963792964
Among these, the preferred strategy is to increase fluid intake and urine flow so as to dilute the concentration of drugs below the threshold of detection.	0.9825583685980581
To determine the extent of possible specimen dilution the urinary creatinine concentration is generally determined.	0.8881523323081868
Based on data from uncontrolled and controlled fluid intake studies in the literature and physiological conditions of urinary excretion, the meaningfulness of creatinine concentration in randomly obtained urine samples is discussed.	1.0801340331490554
A low creatinine concentration not clearly proving an intentional dilution of the sample, the application of GC/MS analysis or the concentration of the urine prior to drug screening is recommended for specimens exhibiting a "suspect" urinary creatinine concentration.	1.0141490385038119
Goal: Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring has a key role within the neuromonitoring, although ICP does not monitor processes of the central neuron directly and only with delay.	1.045914761233577
One of the important factors in ICP monitoring is measurement accuracy.	1.0473844517040376
For a better understanding of ICP probes and their differences, the function and principles of intracranial pressure transducers should be evaluated from a technical point of view.	1.0482341714719081
The therapy for spontaneous or artificial perforation of the esophagus remains a controversial matter.	0.9663949039212961
The following case report deals with the medical history of an artificial esophageal perforation after operative treatment of cervical disc disease.	1.0708684052845578
A 68-year-old male patient underwent a C4/C5 and C5/C6 discectomy with interbody fusion of C7-T1 vertebral body, according to Smith-Robinson.	0.8146245025823873
During this operation, a 3-cm-long lesion was made in the posterior wall of the esophagus, which was treated 24 h later with a primary suture.	1.2995928586999996
The clinical follow-up was complicated by mediastinitis with subsequent multiorgan failure.	0.9668189807191913
After recovery from this critical condition the patient complained of severe dysphagia, which was related to a persistent lesion in the posterior esophageal wall with endoscopically demonstrated dislocation of a screw.	1.1626263487502129
After removal of the screw, the lesion was covered by means of sternocleidomastoid myoplasty.	0.9948236914321579
Moderate postoperative dysphagia was successfully treated by bougienage.	0.8499325360024806
Introduction: The loss of functional capacity by peripheral nerve lesion is easy to be estimated: A certain neurologic dysfunction results in a characteristic reduction of the former individual capacity.	1.2052271148127185
In contrast, the effect of accompanying pain to every-day life and working ability is not known exactly.	0.9577196906227153
In this study, we compared the results of judgement in nerve lesions under the circumstances of additional pain syndromes.	1.1084989022564689
The guidelines of the International Union against Cancer are generally used to assess malignancy of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.	1.0439304333990924
Beside TNM-staging, histological grading is performed.	0.8261733789175664
This system has been extended by a selection of histological parameters which were studied with respect to prognosis, based on a review of 184 patients with squamous cell carcinoma.	1.0711779450421777
An increased malignancy was found in carcinomas with the following features: clinical diameter greater than 2 cm, low degree of keratinization, high degree of cellular polymorphism, high mitotic index and high tumor thickness index (metastases only from tumor thickness 2,4 mm and subcutaneous infiltration), desmoplasia and ulceration.	1.148834938874883
Consideration of histological tumor parameters improved prognosis assessment.	0.7188960602132357
Multivariate analyses with large case series are necessary to determine ranks of the prognostic factors.	0.9446220332062203
Therefore, the data analysis of all centers that contribute to the carcinoma registry will make a precise difinition of high- and low-risk carcinomas possible and can thus influence therapy and follow-up procedures.	1.251813243819079
Surgical closure of atrial septal defects can nowadays be performed without preoperative cardiac catheterization.	0.8698856238704443
For a transcatheter closure, however, x-ray exposure has been indispensable.	1.029985897201146
We report a closure of an atrial septal defect under transesophageal echocardiography without fluoroscopy.	0.9555113781304019
In field research, training intensity was tested during three different dances by recording the exercise heart rates.	0.8622284611104613
The subjects (twelve women from 59 to 77 years old) were tested once a week three times, over three minutes with a break of three minutes, three weeks in all.	1.102125574976773
The sequence of the dances changed every week.	0.7268105213136609
Measurement of baroreflex sensitivity is a new method to identify patients after myocardial infarction with a high risk for sudden cardiac death, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.	1.1470762722758954
In this retrospective study the baroreflex sensitivity was obtained noninvasively by measuring the systolic blood pressure with a FINAPRES-device and correlating this with the R-R intervals of the ECG after raising blood pressure with an intravenous dose of Norfenefrinhydrochlorid (Novadral).	1.0150901494872517
According to other investigators a correlation of >0.7 with a significance of p<0.05 was recommended for evaluable results with a baroreflex sensitivity <3 ms/mm Hg being judged as decreased.	1.0836326074556806
We investigated 302 patients (mean age 59 +/- 17 years, 224 males, 78 females).	1.0097147612842028
75% of the investigations showed acceptable results.	1.1260437991151446
In 77 cases (25%) reasonable results could not be achieved.	0.9539827109252306
We found premature ventricular beats to be responsible in 18 investigations (6% of all investigations).	1.2529512769896256
41 (13.1%) of all investigations were not evaluable because of bad correlation for unknown reason.	1.1966471153678093
When we looked closely at these nonevaluable results, we found a significantly higher number of patients with impaired left ventricular ejection fraction (<40%), diabetes or inducible sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia in the electrophysiologic study in this group.	1.2266891201545507
Embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas of the female genital tract usually occur during infancy in the vagina.	0.8472936373367036
Only in rare cases can they be found in the cervix, where they are most commonly seen in adolescence.	1.1332109085231972
Their prognosis seems to be good since the introduction of a combination of surgery and chemotherapy.	0.9107022666549076
We report a case of cervical embryonal rhabdomysarcoma in IRS stage Ia in a 32-year-old female.	0.9214031560876085
After surgical resection and chemotherapy there has been no evidence of disease for 7 months.	1.1016924115731035
The case is compared with the published literature and prognostically relevant features, and possible problems in the differential diagnosis in biopsies are discussed.	1.18655970266288
Between 1987 and 1993, 41 grade 3B open tibial shaft fractures were treated with the unreamed tibial nail (URTN n = 22) or an external fixator (FIX n = 19).	1.0347040188949495
The method of treatment was left to the choice of the operating surgeon.	1.250715586773499
Three below the knee amputations were performed, three patients died, and three were lost to follow-up.	1.2083869809981869
In all, 32 patients were followed up to union or at least for 1 year.	1.0443540055934835
There were no significant statistical differences between the two groups (P<0.2, chi-squared, t-test) with respect to fracture type, fracture location, age, gender or accompanying injuries.	1.1091164464230692
The URTN group showed significantly better results regarding time to full weight-bearing (URTN 11 +/- 4 weeks; FIX 20 +/- 11 weeks, P<0.01 M-W) Mann-Whitney Test, number of reoperations (URTN 1.04; FIX 2.89; P<0.01 M-W), isolated bone grafting (URTN 3/22; FIX 8/19; P<0.05 chi-squared), and average Karlström and Olerud score (URTN 30 +/- 4; FIX 26 +/- 5; P<0.05 M-W).	1.075797335106555
In all, 15/17 URTN patients and only 6/15 FIX patients achieved unlimited walking distance (P<0.01 M-W).	0.906722702627299
Time to bony union, infection, and nonunion were not significantly different between groups.	0.8985728354416115
By varying the light spectrum, impulse length, impulse sequences and fluences, the PhotoDermVL allows a large choice of individual treatment parameters.	1.0071708647670525
Superficial as well as deeper localized vascular malformations (essential telangiectases, port-wine stains, Poikiloderma of Civatte, hemangiomatous malformations) and cosmetically bothering hypertrichosis can be treated successfully with this high intensity polychromatic pulsed light source.	0.9635360421347966
Catheter ablation is an established method to treat paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.	0.9348860750270367
However, the risks of catheter ablation have to bee weight against antiarrhythmic therapy.	1.0354571574059923
With catheter ablation AV-block III °, pulmonary embolism, pericardial tamponade (in some cases followed by death), arterial embolism as well as other complications have been described.	1.2229124726788037
Especially the long term consequences of prolonged fluoroscopy time are an increased risk for fatal malignancies in young patients.	1.0043813011730172
On the other hand the efficacy of antiarrhythmic therapy in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia has been shown.	1.0523748390523404
The risk of proarrhythmia associated with the treatment with class 1 and class 3 antiarrhythmic drugs that has been documented in patients after mayocardial infarction and in heart failure patients cannot be transferred to patients without structural heart disease.	1.109303012164917
It is concluded that drug therapy is still an important form of treatment in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.	1.0998004700518562
Background: Chloroquine keratopathy is known as a disease with epithelial deposits in the cornea.	1.1701065211293875
The appearance of corneal changes does not seem to be related to dose and duration of treatment.	0.7345363255231059
The purpose of this study was to investigate microscopic changes of corneal morphology in patients treated with chloroquine in vivo.	0.9192371716777353
Dermatological rehabilitation treatment can take different forms: climato-therapy, baths, phototherapy and psychosomatic treatments.	0.8484331464267267
Which of these treatments is of most benefit to any one patient depends on his or her illness.	0.8945671397413226
Accordingly, a psychosomatic approach to dermatological illness is indicated mainly when a psychological disorder and a dermatological disease coincide.	0.9738908504563274
In addtion, dermatoses with psychological triggers or overlays, and also depression, pre-existing emotional disorders and special motivation for psychotherapy should be considered for psychosomatic treatment.	1.103866938332576
Finally, patients who are having trouble accepting or confronting malignant skin tumours may also benefit.	1.216196619250852
We report about the possibility of electrophysiological diagnosis and therapy in the treatment of a symptomatic left ventricular tachycardia which could not be treated effectively by oral medical therapy in a 10 year old boy with no obvious structural heart disease.	1.1702749016416862
By right bundle-bloc-like QRS-complexes in the surface-ECG, the diagnosis of the ventricular origin of the tachycardia was confirmed by transesophageal-ECG.	1.091901822429676
This was followed by the first electrophysiological examination that showed increased leftventricular vulnerability.	0.9361483135335771
During this electrophysiological examination the tachycardia was terminated by stimulated singular premature beats.	0.716625087817689
An oral medical therapy with sotalol was started.	0.6960223649153543
After the phase of saturation the next ventricular stimulation was done, that showed no sufficient protection of sotalol against VT.	0.9856990304252436
So the decision was made for ventricular ablation.	0.7890342670474982
After 5 high frequency-applications no furhter ventricular tachycardia could be induced.	0.7815163570520853
Since this intervention the patient lives without symptoms.	0.7281352272743195
The vertebral bodies and vertebral arches show a characteristic distribution of cortical and cancellous bone.	0.833213090031015
The pedicles are loaded by uniplanar bending that is reflected by the arrangement of the Corticalis.	0.7483543025512465
The ligaments of the vertebral column consist of longitudinal and (with exception of the lig.	1.2302030020178425
longitudinale anterius) horizontal/oblique segmental ligament bundles.	0.6799127289086185
In combination with the anulus fibrosus, the ligaments work as a kind of gear system.	0.9225585014596924
They regulate the process of movements of adjactent vertebral bodies in a very precise manner and control the final phase of motion.	1.0066466247820471
Besides maintaining the necessary amount of pretension the intervertebral disc distributes the loads uniformly onto the adjacent vertebral bodies.	0.7530136294716422
The intervertebral joints are important for guided motion, by restricting the extent in specific planes and directions.	1.0312558846681326
Because of their position, they are able to take up the shear forces and to simultaneously restrict them in different planes.	1.01948067218751
The integrity of the fascia thoracolumbalis warrants the protective function of the autochthonuos muscles.	0.790991675234639
Prolonged immobilization or physical inactivity has been shown to produce increased bone resorption due to enhanced osteoclastic activity and diminished bone formation.	0.9045586961809247
These skeletal changes are a typical complication in tetraplegic patients, who are at risk of developing hypocalcemia.	1.0734794242700068
Hypercalciuria is the most characteristic symptom.	0.9564509282920942
Risk factors for development of malignant melanoma have been investigated in several case control studies during the last decade, with some variation in results, partly with geographical region.	1.1190825668605775
Four studies have been conducted under the auspices of the Central Malignant Melanoma Registry of the German Dermatological Society; these have yielded consistent results allowing the identification of risk factors for melanoma development.	1.0386101521738356
The numbers of common melanocytic naevi, of atypical melanocytic naevi and the frequency of actinic lentigines were found by multivariate regression analysis to be the most important independent risk factors for melanoma development.	1.0285830872614505
Additional factors were hair colour, skin type and a history of naevus growth.	0.9172904218297214
A classification of relative risks was established by considering the first three risk factors mentioned, without any clear improvement of classification when further additional significant factors were taken into accout.	1.0552439831105536
For example, in individuals with more than 50 common melanocytic naevi, 5 or more atypical melanocytic naevi and simultaneous presence of actinic lentigines the risk of developing melanoma was found to be 100-fold that in persons with 10 common melanocytic naevi or fewer and without atypical melanocytic naevi or actinic lentigines.	1.0822640698052395
Early recognition of melanomas may be substantially improved if these risk factors are considered.	0.8922228510555054
Furthermore, intermittent intensive sun exposure (sunburns as indicator) before the age of 20 induces the development of melanocytic naevi, and after the age of 20 it contributes to the development of actinic lentigines; both factors are associated with an increased risk of melanoma development.	1.2005459103747569
Problem: Clinical and ultrasound data of neonatal hips were analysed to answer the question whether a neonatal screening is necessary or not.	1.0968134488353478
Method: Children born between 1.	1.0600889454938134
1995 were examined clinically and by ultrasound.	0.7658175412746291
The data were analysed by SPSS/PC.	0.8704782883679485
Results: 5069 children with 10 138 hips were examined.	0.9568488534947833
85 % were mature (type I), 14 % were physiologically immature (type IIa) and 1.2 % were pathological (IIc, D, IIIa).	1.4559673135666789
The comparison shows, that from 119 hips with pathological ultrasound findings only 44 (37 %) had positive clinical findings.	1.1145035170661446
A screening that is restricted to children with positive risk factors (positive family history or breech position) would result in half of the newborns with pathological hips not being treated in time.	0.9332363338705586
The interpretation of three-dimensional (3D) structures of the coronary tree and the myocardium by a clinician demands a subjective visual integration of two-dimensional (2D) images of cardiac diagnostic procedures like coronary angiography and myocardial scintigraphy.	0.9955378800779725
Although in the conventional analysis of 2D display scintigraphic myocardial perfusion segments are arbitrarily assigned to three major coronary artery systems, the standard myocardial perfusion distribution territories correspond with the individual pathologic-anatomic coronary tree in only 50-60% of the patients.	1.0204026057895208
Hence, the mental integration ob both 2D images of coronary angiography and myocardial scintigraphy does not necessarily allow an accurate assignment of particular myocardial perfusion regions to the corresponding vessels.	1.0209768830879589
For an objective assignment of each vessel segment of the coronary tree to the corresponding myocardial regions, we have developed a 3D "fusion image" technique and applied it to patients with coronary artery disease.	1.1163551345370193
Cause-and-effect relationships may be more obvious with 3D data fusion and may enable an easier comparison of anatomy and physiology.	0.8808406199721436
The physician's duty of professional discretion is one of the basic tenets at the heart of the doctor's profession.	1.01539187262025
It is laid down in the physicians' professional code and determined ultimately by the patient's right to self-determination, which is regulated in §203 of the German Criminal Code.	1.118543148301224
It is established in the ordinance governing physicians' work and has its origin in the patient's right of self-determination.	1.034632991922028
It is also regulated in §203 of the German Criminal Code.	0.7725602185874267
An exception can be made to the duty of professional secrecy if a patient gives express permission for this or if it is allowed or required by law.	1.0165345545136864
Some such exceptions are also specified in the German Social Code, although the physician's duty of disclosure is then always precisely stated, particularly when medical data in the strictest sense of the phrase are concerned.	1.133789872387549
Borderline cases are described to illustrate how the rules of professional medical discretion are breached in the course of day-to-day business transacted between the statutory accident insurance firms and the physicians under contract to them, and some hints are given on how this can be avoided.	1.0400721156876012
We report on a 56-year-old renal allograft recipient receiving cyclosporin A immunosuppression.	0.8987766754669567
During this therapy he subsequently developed the following cutaneous neoplasms: squamous cell carcinomas, basal cell carcinomas, Bowen's disease, actinic keratosis, sebaceous hyperplasia, a dysplastic naevus and, finally a nodular malignant melanoma.	0.9386259766652668
Adverse effects of the cyclosporin A therapy are discussed, with special reference to dermatologic effects and the implications for patient and doctor.	1.2116546756438238
With Multislice Spiral Computed Tomography (MSCT), existing indications for performing CT of the chest are strengthened and new applications are emerging.	1.1183598191862243
The high speed of MSCT improves efficiency, image quality and patient comfort of "routine"- imaging of the chest.	1.1481197037813333
The ability to cover large volumes with thin slices improves the evaluation of mediastinal lymph nodes and pulmonary nodules and allows for high-quality secondary reconstruction.	1.0148993051980657
If a comprehensive diagnosis of the mediastinal structures and the pulmonary parenchyma is desired, MSCT for the first time allows reconstruction of contiguous and high- resolution (HRCT) sections from the same set of thin-collimation raw data.	1.117921452965063
This way, contiguous chest images of superior and HRCT sections of equal image quality compared to conventional CT scanning can be obtained.	0.8868410760636262
Vascular protocols greatly benefit from the high speed of MSCT: For imaging the thoracic aorta or pulmonary emboli (PE), the amount of contrast material can be substantially reduced.	1.0605609010248942
Owing to thin collimation, the detection-rate of small peripheral emboli can be significantly increased.	1.0057770565711814
If indicated, the entire subphrenic venous system can be evaluated during the same session, without additional contrast material.	1.092828678519194
Abstract   Basis of the modern shoulder implants is the Neer II-system, a non constrained total shoulder prosthesis with conforming radii of curvature and improved protection against dislocation.	1.1241452410697668
The second generation of shoulder prosthesis is based on the geometric shaft design of the Neer II prosthesis and offers not only a variety of modular head- and shaft-sizes but also through different radii a physiologic rotation-translation-mechanism.	1.0180810379388894
The third generation of humeral head prosthesis carries the concept of an anatomic reconstruction one step further and enables the surgeon to adjust the inclination and the eccentric offset of the humeral head to restore the centre of rotation.	0.9836770543025594
The latest development in shoulder arthroplasty are humeral head prosthesis with a fully variable 3-dimensional modularity to independently adjust the prosthestic head position regardless of the individual shaft geometry.	0.9635466035087412
This achieves a 3-dimensional adaptability of the prosthetic head about the stem axis in the coronary and in the sagittal plane.	1.1384521053634102
Besides of the humeral shaft prosthesis an alternative concept of shoulder joint replacement is established - the replacement of the humeral head articular surface.	1.185876495199895
A hemispheric surface prosthesis - cup arthroplasty - is cemented onto the residual humeral head, which eliminates the obligatory humeral head resection and the reaming of the medullary canal.	1.0905381975583297
Bipolar shoulder prosthesis are humeral shaft prosthesis with a bi-rotational head system.	0.780576378892407
Their indication is limited to pre-existing lesions of the rotator cuff and/or the glenoid surface.	1.0566265354559805
The inverse total shoulder prosthesis reverses the articular surface morphology of the humeral head and the glenoid.	0.9868891388201197
The hemispheric glenoid component serves as the centre of rotation for the concave epiphyseal proximal humerus component.	0.8349607383534237
This implant is especially used in cases of massive rotator cuff deficiences.	0.8757934587434312
The role of shoulder prosthesis in treating acute humeral head fractures needs special consideration.	0.8445999102849874
A fracture prosthesis has to restore the exact length of the humerus, the centre of rotation, and the anatomical retroversion.	1.2773383920143373
Positioning of the tubercula and their adequate osteosynthesis is most critical and fundamental to ensure a correct healing process.	0.8968798452424359
A failed consolidation of the tubercula does not lead to a satisfying result.	0.8165120826355263
The shoulder joint replacement can be sufficiently fixated in cemented, cementless or hybrid techniques.	0.9730147030076357
Today several component design variations of cemented glenoid implants exist.	0.6789568530051571
Their main distinction is the fixation system which can be divided into two main groups - the keel - and the peg-shaped glenoid components.	1.3947857186191062
The peg-shaped anchorage system shall guarantee a greater stability against shear-forces.	0.7362572476853354
Cementless glenoid components consist of a polyethylen inlay and a surface treated metal-back with an integrated fixation system.	0.8645355467969235
These fixation systems are object of intensive biomechanical research and range from conventional screw fixation to specialised cone systems and self-cutting cage-screw-systems.	0.8965658011435059
The critical area of cementless glenoid components is the transition zone of the PE-inlay and the metal-back because of high force development.	0.9433521272720685
The question of implanting a hemi- or total shoulder prosthesis is answered by the morphologic changes of the glenoid articular surface, which includes the size of the subchondral defect and the underlying etiology of the shoulder joint disease, and the age of the patient.	1.357181080587192
Preoperative planning must consist of an adequate radiologic work-up - X-ray, CT or MRI - to accurately assess the glenoid morphology.	1.2182766149510742
G. Walch categorised the different glenoid lesions and developed a very important classification of possible glenoid deformations.	1.0241507342142813
To compare and evaluate the operative results one must consider the different shoulder prosthesis and the discrepancies between a hemi- and a total shoulder prosthetic replacement.	1.1631442256769138
Looking at the loosening and survival rate of the implant the results are related to the type of prosthesis and the preoperative diagnosis.	1.219728501487033
The Neer total shoulder prosthesis has a 15 year survival rate of 87 %, compared to 74 % of the hemi-prosthesis.	1.216820288623168
The objective for the future has to be to further advance the development of prosthetic components, especially for primary joint replacement in acute humeral head fractures.	1.15605145257519
Another point of interest is how to reduce the still existing high loosening rates of the glenoid components.	0.9708219902556025
A fairly new research-field is the computer-assisted surgery, e. g. navigation systems and robotics.	0.9422456946041124
The computer-assisted navigation could be of great advantage to accurately find the individual resection plane (inclination and restroversion) of the humeral head.	1.0969264936180774
The use of a surgery-robot could be very helpful to reproducibly achieve the desired conformity of the articular surface when preparing the glenoid.	1.0079721240626802
Two patients with complete paralysis of the axillary nerve are reported on.	1.0334482530829108
One case is well documented.	0.7761094784821815
In both cases there was very good functional adaptation, resulting from hypertrophy of the rotator cuff so that there was only a slight or no loss of movement.	1.0911130354004037
The rotator cuff should therefore be exercised at an early stage when there is isolated axillary nerve damage.	0.9908619952385456
The function of the supraspinous muscle is also discussed.	0.6535310931075806
Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach (1792-1847) is generally known as the founder of modern plastic surgery.	0.9386412275101957
One focus of his work, apart from the physiology of transplantation and operative techniques, was reconstructive oral and maxillofacial surgery.	1.023257304447613
This special aspect of plastic surgery as well as Dieffenbach's biography is presented in this historic article.	0.8442363953239491
When a lifeless person is found in a bath tub, the emergency physician is obliged to give medical assistance.	1.0640692335662685
If the patient is dead on arrival, the manner of death will in most cases unsettled.	1.0649188708837478
In these cases the physician should inform the police immediately.	1.0275439384148863
Any alteration of the scene of death should be avoided.	0.8216549479497097
The purpose of this review is to outline the laparoscopic-endoscopic procedures that we perform for early gastric cancer.	0.8715588067071598
These procedures were applied to 29 patients.	0.8218857888244175
Preoperative work-up included gastric endoscopy, barium X-ray examination, endoscopic ultrasonography, and histological examination, and surgery was performed in patients diagnosed as having mucosal gastric cancer for which endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) was difficult.	1.1832482286817727
Laparoscopic wedge resection of the stomach using the lesion-lifting method, by which a wedge resection is made while pulling up the full-thickness gastric wall, was carried out in the 16 patients with lesions of the anterior wall, lesser curvature, and greater curvature of the stomach.	1.1633507409970485
On pathological examination of resected specimens, the surgical margin and lymphatic or venous invasion were negative in all these patients.	1.0659764852365938
The histological depth of the lesions was m (mucosal cancer) in 15 patients and sm1 (slight cancer infiltration into the submucosal layer) in one.	1.2066975434735572
This one patient later underwent gastrectomy but no lymph node metastases were found.	0.8576428895929608
Oral nutrition was resumed for a mean ( +/-  SD) of 2.9  +/-  0.8 days after operation, and the duration of hospitalization after operation was 12.3  +/-  3.4 days.	1.157647808641192
The 13 patients with lesions of the posterior wall of the stomach and near the cardia or the pylorus received laparoscopic intragastric mucosal resection.	0.8865696270636458
Laparotomy was required in 1 of these patients due to intraoperative hemorrhage.	1.0497315508591032
The surgical margins were negative in all 12 patients in whom laparoscopic intragastric mucosal resection was successful.	0.9603436220068079
Lymphatic or venous invasion was positive in 2, both of whom had sm1 cancer lesions of both of these patients were located in the cardiac region, total gastrectomy was avoided, and careful observation is continued.	1.2189314999348053
Oral nutrition was resumed 4.0  +/-  1.6 days after operation, and the duration of hospitalization after operation was 12.0  +/-  3.5 days.	1.1407137459945977
In addition, no postoperative complication was noted after either procedure, and all patients have been recurrence free for a follow-up period of 460 months.	1.2565193379080317
Selected properly, these laparoscopic endoscopic procedures are considered to be curative and minimally invasive treatments for early gastric cancer.	0.8978479255300654
Between 1988 and 1997, tumor resection was carried out in 18 irradiated patients (group 1: 36-72 Gy, 83 implants) and 22 nonirradiated patients (group 2: 92 implants) in the mandible and floor of the mouth, and these patients subsequently underwent mandibular endosseous implant rehabilitation.	1.2625886353993712
A total of 23 patients were treated with exclusively implant-supported prostheses, and 16 with implant tissue-supported constructions.	1.0936725075491456
Between 1988 and 1991, group 1 and 2 patients received implant tissue-supported prostheses (using two to four implants).	1.101304457921596
Due to prosthesis-related pressure lesions, the strategy has now been changed.	0.9128428508129262
Since 1992, group 1 patients have received exclusively implant-supported prostheses (using five to six implants), while group 2 patients have received implant tissue-supported constructions (using four implants).	1.1192206132117521
Special criteria for the success of implant-supported maxillofacial prosthetics were drawn up.	0.9066631429783253
With an average follow-up period of 37 months, 160 fixtures (91%) were clinically osseointegrated.	1.1011783643378086
Both types of restoration provided sufficient oral rehabilitation.	0.6010386008323161
However, only completely implant-supported prostheses avoided soft tissue ulcers.	1.2328427180093655
The overall success rate was about 77% after 7 years in group 1 and about 87% after 9 years in group 2.	1.304665161878032
With regard to implants placed after strategy change, the 5-year success rate was approximately 86% (group 1) and 94% (group 2).	1.1799316506978288
In irradiated patients, an exclusively implant-supported prosthesis without any mucosal contact (thus avoiding soft tissue ulcers with a potential to develop osteoradionecrosis) should therefore be fabricated.	1.071519556277298
Implant tissue-supported restoration is also possible in nonirradiated oral cancer patients.	0.940569643287737
Extracorporal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has been postulated as an additional therapeutic option in nonunion after fracture treatment.	1.0627398329110063
We have reexamined patients with nonunions treated at our institution to evaluate the efficacy of the method.	0.9529143929936574
In a prospective nonrandomized study patients were investigated with a minimum duration of nonunion of 6 months.	1.2147664118097259
Following 2 cycles of ESWT with 2000 impulses/18 kV, the reevaluation was performed at 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment.	1.1506292727133365
A total of 27 pseudarthroses was reevaluated, in 11 one or more reosteosyntheses had been performed prior to ESWT.	1.1328928357558459
Following ESWT we found a success rate of 41 % (n = 11).	1.321205699173174
The clinical evidence of subjective, clinical improvement was found in 5 of these patients within 1 month, in all of these patients within a period of 3 months.	1.2661800237383634
Radiologic evidence of improvement occurred in none of these patients within 1 month, in all of these patients within 6 months.	1.0630374888233998
ESWT appears to represent an additional treatment option in patients with longstanding nonunion.	0.9598542770096137
If no improvement occurs, the maximum delay of reosteosynthesis is three months.	0.9739209784904271
Over a period of 11 years a total of 140 liver resections for non-colorectal, non-neuroendocrine hepatic metastases were performed in 127 patients (73 women, 54 men; median age 53 years).	1.0529210108972364
There were 120 first, 14 second and 6 third liver resections.	0.9863781523861376
Primary tumors were: breast cancer (n = 34), leiomyosarcoma (n = 20), pancreatic cancer (n = 16), renal cell carcinoma (n = 13), melanoma (n = 9), gastric cancer (n = 9), lung cancer (n = 6) and adrenal cancer (n = 6) and miscellaneous tumors (n = 14).	1.3095287568688363
Extrahepatic tumor manifestation (including synchronous primary tumors) was found in 69/140 cases (49 %); 61 of 120 patients with a first liver resection had extrahepatic tumor (51 %).	1.209549988876799
In the 120 first liver resections, 82 (68 %) R0, 13 (11 %) R1 and 25 (21 %) R2 excisions were possible.	1.2694096237562909
Median survival after first liver resection was 20 months; after R0 resection a median survival of 28 months and after R1/2 resection of 8 months was achieved.	0.946771579866472
The 5-year survival rate was 16 % for the total group, 24 % in patients with R0 resection and 0 % for R1/2 resections.	1.4389918368470076
After a second liver resection (n = 14) there was a median survival of 28 months (5-year-survival-rate of 21 %) for all patients and of 41 months (5-year survival rate 38 %) after R0 resection.	1.2854857218158038
Morbidity and mortality after the first liver resection were 32.5 % and 5.8 %, respectively.	1.4035169625685882
In patients without extrahepatic tumor at the time of the first liver resection a median survival of 32 months (5-year survival rate 25 %) and 7 months was achieved after R0 resection and R1/2 resection, respectively.	1.1517036383683967
In case of extrahepatic tumor the median survival was 24 months (5-year survival rate 23 %) for R0 resection compared to 8 months after R1/2 resection.	1.128022203584535
These data suggest that not the presence of extrahepatic tumor but rather the possibility of a R0 resection is most decisive for the prognosis after liver resection.	1.0809572174519229
We conclude that patients with liver metastases of non-colorectal, non-neuroendocrine tumors may benefit from liver resection.	1.0299697275288082
Similar to colorectal metastases, a second or third liver resection can be worthwhile in selected cases.	0.9217612630919193
Even in more unfavorable tumor entities, several cases of long-term survival were observed after surgical therapy.	1.215522959695843
Therefore, the indication for liver resection should be considered carefully in every single case.	1.052873233658443
Generalizations about the outcomes of psychotherapy are essentially based on research on brief therapies with quite short follow-up.	0.8710507008012038
The present paper is a survey of some of the findings in an effectiveness study of psychoanalysis and long-term psychotherapy, typically psychoanalytically oriented, in private practice.	1.1412580831595907
The design was a three-wave panel comprising more than 700 patients.	0.8989167942904527
At the end of the third wave, 418 patients in different phases of treatment remained in the sample.	0.8650081629977552
Across a reconstructed time scale covering roughly seven years, before, during, and after treatment, the 74 psychoanalysis cases described a very positive development, whereas the development among the 331 psychotherapy cases was moderately positive.	1.179413412321432
The findings emphasize the importance of extended follow-up.	0.8044812344243438
When therapist variables are considered, therapeutic experience had complex or mixed associations with patients outcome.	0.9445065547186358
Especially positive were high age and many years, in private practice, after licensing.	1.0421641511470905
Therapeutic ideals and attitudes divided the therapist group in three subgroups, one of which was characterized by purely classical psychoanalytic views on the values of support, friendliness etc.	0.9566910300306731
Therapists in the classically psychoanalytic cluster were found to do poorly with patients in psychotherapy, in contrast to patients in psychoanalysis.	1.1728119461630477
It is concluded that psychoanalysis and psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy are qualitatively different.	0.7865095513780975
Experimental studies and open clinical trials have suggested intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) as a potentially effective treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS).	1.0003934011557654
The Austrian Immunoglobulin in Multiple Sclerosis (AIMS) study tested this assumption by examining 148 patients with relapsing-remitting MS in a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled fashion (75 IVIg, 73 placebo).	0.9331569384812356
Monthly administration of IVIg in a dosage of 0.15-0.20 g/kg over a period of 2 years slowed the progression of or even reversed disability as evident in a total of 24% of patients and almost halved the number of relapses in comparison to placebo treatment.	1.1266743511752524
Therapeutic efficacy was noted within the first 6 months of treatment and was not correlated to the severity of disability (mild neurological sins without disability to ambulatory with assistance) at study entry.	1.1308835047469745
Overall the magnitude of treatment effects of IVIg was comparable to that reported for beta-interferon and copolymer 1.	1.0036124152605421
Further ongoing studies will have to clarify the future role of IVIg in the treatment of MS, in particular in the progressive forms of the disease.	1.1223615611808355
Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is a rare cause of ischemic heart disease.	0.9071920310729852
Incidence, etiology and optimal treatment are ill-defined.	0.7768292949814913
Between July 1995 and December 1997, we prospectively identified 42 patients (36 men, six women, mean age 59 +/- 12 years) with spontaneous coronary artery dissection among 3803 consecutive angiographic examinations in which the diagnosis of coronary artery disease was established for the first time (incidence 1.1%).	1.134290859453956
In comparison to the remaining study population with stable angina pectoris (8 cases of spontaneous coronary artery dissection among 2852 patients; incidence: 0.3%), the incidence of spontaneous coronary artery dissection was significantly higher in the patient subgroups with acute myocardial infarction (13/450; 2.9%) and with unstable angina pectoris or postinfarction angina (21/501; 4.2%).	1.1846167264709218
Dissection was most frequently located in the left anterior descending coronary artery (19 cases), followed by the right coronary artery (15 cases) and the left circumflex coronary artery (8 cases).	1.3280813587431155
Because of an ambiguous angiographic lesion appearance intravascular ultrasound imaging was performed in 13 patients to confirm the diagnosis.	0.9412027229767324
The presumed etiology of spontaneous coronary artery dissection was atherosclerotic plaque rupture in 35 cases, heavy physical exercise in four cases and hormonal influences related to pregnancy and contraception in one case.	0.9809165679497387
In two cases, no obvious risk factor could be identified.	0.9210967682547426
Therapy consisted of intracoronary stenting in 24 patients (including ten patients with acute myocardial infarction), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 8 patients and balloon angioplasty (PTCA) in seven patients.	1.2118388906897695
Three patients were treated conservatively.	1.0555569617807328
Introduction: Since the introduction of laparoscopic hernioplasty the TAPP procedure (transabdominal preperitoneal approach) has become the most widely used technique.	1.1541208263532043
Many surgeons have changed to the total extraperitoneal approach (TEP), because they fear the consequences of a peritoneal lesion.	1.187144216248566
Method: We evaluated our results with TAPP in a retrospective study, with special attention to complications caused by the approach.	1.298372080726509
We operated on 460 hernias in 390 patients in a period of 5 years.	1.0153939525453028
Results: Complication rates and recurrence rates were similar to those after TEP.	1.1027777576017677
There was a marked learning curve with decrease of both rates during the evaluated years.	1.001923252415068
There were no complications related to the transabdominal approach other than trocar hernias, the rate of which could be reduced by eliminating the learning curve and by using smaller trocar diameter.	1.0699536662876423
Conclusion: We see no reason to change from TAPP to the TEP technique.	1.1211634370945653
This article examines the use and acceptance of ticket machines, automatic teller machines (ATMs) and telephone cards by the elderly in four European regions.	0.9492796430632243
The analyses are based on data from an international project entitled "Keeping the Elderly Mobile", collected in Mannheim (former West Germany; N=404 home-dwelling respondents), Chemnitz (former East Germany; N=400), Ancona (Italy; N=600), and Jyväskylä (Finland; N=618).	1.1033026879596188
The random sample was stratified by age and gender in each country.	0.7964953716389223
Two generations of men and women (aged 55-74 and 75+ years, respectively) participated in the study.	0.9879295031631912
Results show that respondents generally made little use of the three technologies under investigation: in fact, the majority of respondents does not use them at all.	1.1677377697869447
The most frequently used devices were ATMs in Chemnitz and ticket machines and telephone cards in Mannheim.	0.7564806802164095
On the basis of logistic regression analysis, age was the most important explanatory factor for the three technologies and for all four regions, i.e., the users were mostly the "young-old."	1.1026357614591857
Education was a more important variable than gender.	0.8760530224798065
In all four regions, the majority of the respondents who used the technologies assessed felt that each of them made life easier; nevertheless, ticket machines make life more difficult to almost every third user in Mannheim.	1.0382236791965718
Interesting differences and similarities among the towns were also found.	0.6947787861327769
The present study exhibits preliminary results regarding elderly and technology which future research should investigate in greater depth.	1.014159090110285
In order to examine the efficacy of whole body acupuncture additionally applied to drug treatment in depression, a single-blind placebo-controlled study with 70 inpatients administered to three different treatment groups has been carried out.	1.0899920675308503
All patients were pharmacologically treated with the tetracyclic antidepressant mianserin.	1.04656982205924
The verum group (n=22) received acupuncture at specific points considered to be effective in the treatment of depression.	1.0122348852750482
The placebo group (n=24) was treated with acupuncture at non-specific locations and the control group (n=24) received only pharmacological treatment.	0.9693082342207388
Acupuncture was applied three times a week over a period of four weeks.	0.9637705093570715
Psychopathology was rated by judges blind to verum/placebo conditions twice a week over eight weeks with the CGI, GAS, BRMS and BfS rating scales.	0.8360372780560116
Additionally applied acupuncture improved the course of depression more than pharmacological treatment with mianserin did by itself.	0.9098210770480729
However, we could not detect any differences between placebo and verum acupuncture.	1.320738768491623
Acute heart failure consists of decompensated chronic heart failure, acute pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock.	0.8260321650718141
While decompensated heart failure shows little therapeutic difficulties therapy of pulmonary edema is more sophisticated.	0.9132589489081057
Cardiogenic shock, however is still a therapeutic challenge.	1.1765501179825955
For therapy of cardiogenic shock positive inotropes, phosphodiesterase-inhibitors and various assist devices are currently in use.	0.922966576421822
If it is not possible to correct underlying diseases, mortality of cardiogenic shock is still high.	1.139225080560531
Two years after the diagnosis of Sézary syndrome, a 50-year old female patient experienced attacks of painful ischemia of both hands and feet, leading to acral necrosis.	1.1001970252295024
Another 59-year old patient presented with severe pain in his feet, secondary to ischemia.	1.1952402870481726
This was the first symptom of a T-cell-chronic lymphocytic leukemia.	1.0844009823747605
Similar cases have only occasionally been described.	0.7812470439547173
The relationship between acral ischemia and T-cell-lymphoma is not clear but is discussed in this article.	1.104818650994177
The clinical features of progression sensorineural hearing loss and vertigo in combina-tion with the radiologic finding of a contrast- enhancing mass within the inner auditory canal are suggestive of an acoustic neuroma.	1.0157221593792747
We report our findings in a 57-year-old woman with known mixed connective tissue disease who was presumed to have a neuroma.	1.0623373774869829
A large malignant lymphoma of the cerebellopontine angle presented clinically with a primary acoustic none palsy and no other central neurological deficits.	0.9096756098697124
Both the primary radiological examinations and the exclusively peripheral nerve palsy failed to indicate manifestationes of a lymphoma.	0.8946554069182272
The development of a progressive facial palsy within 8 weeks of presentation and an atypi-cal occipital headache were uncommon findings for an acoustic neuroma.	0.9844786664537237
Such changes in symptoms despite the occurrence of car-dinal symptoms require further diagnostic measures.	0.8079705366627664
Manifestations of a malignant lymphoma in the cerebellopontine angle are extremely rare.	0.9002835180586578
To our knowledge a case of an intracerebral lymphoma in a patient with Sjögren's syndrome has never been reported before.	1.2093355468044142
Cutaneous blisters on a corpse are not only of forensic interest regarding their etiology and genesis but also the time of origin, particularly the problem of vital, agonal, supravital or postmortem occurrence of cutaneous blisters could be of forensic value.	1.147104308829306
The aim of this work was to summarize the causative spectrum of cutaneous blisters, including poisonous plants and animals, drugs and toxic substances.	1.1483222104449387
The time of origin of cutaneous blisters were evaluated in selected forensically relevant cases.	1.0607621587868072
The purpose of the present study was to compare two sedation regimens with either propofol (P) or methohexital (M) for elective magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in children with respect to safety, side effects, recovery, and discharge time.	1.1788439727219675
Pharmacological thrombolysis is a valuable therapeutic modality for embolic arterial occlusion.	0.8960982025626051
Nevertheless, thorough evaluation of the indications is imperative to avoid serious complications.	1.1690759099034642
The most frequent complication is hemorrhage.	1.0410609741080648
Of these, the intracerebral hemorrhages are rare, but when they do occur they are an immediate threat to life they are accompanied by very severe complications, and they have an extremely poor prognosis.	1.0969074765183295
Within 58 months 361 patients were treated at our neurosurgical clinic with intracerebral hematomas.	1.0288693627158672
In 22 patients (6.1%) the hematoma developed as a complication of systemic thrombolysis.	1.1485619610402944
Two of these patients had been treated for occlusion of the central retinal artery.	1.3294626482411869
One patient died: the other survived but was severely disabled.	1.1875887285222733
The latter patient experienced no benefit from the thrombolysis as for as the underlying ophthalmologic disease was concerned.	0.9450357186355262
These worrying examples stress the necessity for careful evaluation of risk factors and the natural history of the underlying disease for which systemic thrombolysis is indicated.	1.0734086166992252
Local selective (or superselective) thrombolysis is preferable to the systemic procedure, provided that the indications are equally strictly observed and are less likely to lead to severe complications.	1.1036208984664089
We report on a 61-year-old patient with considerable insufficiency of a quadricuspid aortic valve and coronary three vessel disease.	0.985989692126044
The congenital quadricuspid aortic valve has become symptomatic due to the development of (post-endocarditic) insufficiency only in the advanced stage of life.	1.0124522064726107
It was treated by replacement of the aortic valve and bypass myocardial revascularization.	0.9080307191566863
The physiopathology of quadricuspid aortic valve will be discussed.	0.5368959152979672
Due to its high prevalence, atopic dermatitis is an important problem in the dermatologic practice.	1.0786925488159307
The chronicity of the disease together with numerous triggering factors of varying individual impact create a complex situation which is difficult to manage under the current circumstances in our health care system.	1.0032744582291666
We describe the concept of an outpatient clinic especially for atopic dermatitis as established in our Department of Dermatology.	1.2574176180054981
A high degree of standardization is combined with a high measure of individual care.	0.975024330142571
The aims of this clinic are an optimized outpatient management of atopic dermatitis, the gathering of epidemiologic data, the performance of controlled studies, and potentially the reduction of costs.	1.0767427735070454
Abstract:  Traumatic cerebral aneurysms are rare in severely head-injured patients.	0.99765601863556
We present the first case of a traumatic aneurysm of the A1/A2 junction.	1.1171751851341405
Purpose: Although the relationship between optic pits and macular lesions was described nearly a century ago, the pathology and pathogenesis of macular detachment remain unclear.	1.2080105028527828
Recent OCT studies have shown schisislike spaces in connection with the disc.	0.880896181516001
None of the hypotheses of pathogenesis proposed so far could have been proven.	0.9250990276364529
Besides the hypothesis of exudation, the role of the vitreoretinal interface is kept in the background of discussion.	0.9528401202726197
We describe a case of macular detachment associated with optic pit that regained full vision after pars plana vitrectomy with laser coagulation and gas tamponade over a follow-up of 26 months.	0.9562145109270646
The purpose of our case report is to emphasize the role of the vitreoretinal interface in the pathogenesis of macular detachment associated with optic pits.	1.0664432391301106
Sclerosing adenosis of the prostate is a benign lesion, which was not recognized until a few years ago.	1.1982706764797055
As in sclerosing adenosis of the breast, a background of various hyperplastic changes is commonly also present in the prostate.	1.0828506103432087
An incidence of 2.8 % was reported in one series of resected hyperplastic prostatic glands.	1.1976137404629794
As demonstrated in this case report, the main problem lies in the differential diagnosis between sclerosing adenosis and highly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the prostate.	1.120224288636721
Histological diagnosis of sclerosing adenosis based on routine HE sections is supplemented by immunohistochemical methods.	0.7702957676883121
Important diagnostic criteria of sclerosing adenosis are the presence of basal cell differentiation, which is demonstrated by cytokeratin 903, and signs of possible myoepithelial differentiation, with expression of S-100 and/or smooth muscle actin.	1.2008291484598894
These antibody expressions are lacking with in the presence of adenocarcinoma of the prostate.	0.8014151322342603
Nevertheless, in a small number of cases this differential diagnosis remains impossible, even after the application of immunohistochemical methods.	1.381600163613105
Further studies are needed to shed some light on the relations between sclerosing adenosis, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma of the prostate.	0.784298984384603
So far, there appears to be no evidence of a direct relationship between sclerosing adenosis of the prostate and an elevated risk of carcinoma.	1.2216899830077195
Benign intracavitary cardiac tumors lead to "malignant" complications, so early diagnosis and adequate treatment are of vital importance.	1.0693770854039357
Our investigation summarizes a 10-year experience after surgical treatment of 29 patients suffering from benign intracavitary cardiac tumors.	1.0021137785185341
The postoperative histological examination revealed a myxoma in 27 cases; in 2 cases a papillary fibroelastoma was diagnosed.	1.004057806480181
The main symptom in 19 patients was dyspnea.	0.898807614408325
In 8 cases an embolic event occurred.	0.8275024999164173
All patients underwent extirpation of the tumor.	0.8634692214397217
Early mortality was 10 %, while late mortality was 4 %.	1.1359720899053471
The treatment of choice of benign intracavitary cardiac tumors is extirpation, which, due to unpredictable embolic complications, is to be carried out immediately should the tumor have a lobulated tuberous surface.	1.2030610468050311
In such cases the descriptive function of echocardiography is of considerable importance.	0.9350638446092249
We present a case of a 48 year old man who complained of progressive dyspnoe.	1.134854992028414
Radiograph revealed a large tumor in the left lung.	1.1640696882928334
Biopsy was performed and revealed beneath a normal bronchial epithelium polymorph tumor cells admixed with some histiocytes.	0.878274058086252
These tumor cells were strongly pigmented and expressed HMB-45 and protein S-100 immunohistochemically.	0.9400643143465679
Malignant melanoma of the bronchus was included in the differential diagnosis.	0.8228946653807468
A thoracotomy and left lower lobe resection was performed.	0.7592007223991184
The lung is an uncommon localisation of angiomyolipoma with so far three reported cases.	0.9687611403642504
Lipoma, leiomyoma and lymphangioleiomyomatosis have to be included in the differential diagnosis.	0.7125630190030124
The peculiarity of this case is the presence of multiple pigmented tumor cells that express HMB-45.	1.074775061506815
This has not been reported yet.	1.0501901190380944
Background: The maximum number of cell divisions of a certain cell population is genetically fixed so that aging cells become non-dividing (senescent) at least.	1.1347257656885308
This replicative life span, also known as "hayflick limit", is probably defined by a "critical" length of the telomeres.	1.0772593553048193
Telomeres are special DNA-sequences located at the four ends of the chromosomes which are shortened with each cell cycle.	0.8899906755541103
Cells of most, but not all malignant tumours have been shown to reactivate the enzyme telomerase so that telomeres can be reconstructed, "Hayflick limit" can be overcome, and unlimited cell division can be established.	1.1993524264769415
This study was undertaken to elucidate whether telomerase reactivation is used by uveal melanoma cells.	0.9270706384185946
A total of 113 patients with acute and chronic instability of the ulnar collateral ligament metacarpal phalangeal (MP) joint of the thumb were treated surgically between 1980 and 1985; 82 patients were followed up after a mean period of 10 years.	1.1375553549921606
Of 59 patients with acute injuries, 52 were painfree with full stability of the MP joint; 23 patients with chronic instability and tendon grafting also showed restoration of stability.	1.0660479743751885
Nevertheless, the range of motion was reduced severely and opposition of the thumb was impaired.	1.117475381559804
The results of follow-up reveal that acute reattachment of the injured ulnar collateral ligament is more effective.	1.1234869733472115
The purpose of this study was to assess the role of spiral computed tomography (SCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the preoperative work-up of patients with pancreatic carcinoma, regarding local resectability and vascular involvement.	0.976665322648568
Methods and materials: A total of 28 patients (19 men and 9 women; mean age 58 years) with known or highly suspected carcinoma of the pancreas were included in this study.	1.249929816893956
All patients prospectively underwent MRI ( +/-  gadolinium-DTPA) and SCT (3-phase examination) as preoperative diagnostic imaging studies, and laparotomy was carried out within 7 days, irrespective of the MRI or SCT findings.	1.151063929769873
SCT and MR studies were reviewed independently by two radiologists, without knowing the results of the surgical exploration.	1.1639397496684207
Standardized image analysis was correlated with findings at laparatomy.	0.7356358860621917
Results: Laparotomy identified 10 patients to be suitable for surgical resection and 18 pancreatic carcinomas to be unresectable.	1.1185181512661753
In 17 of 18 non-resectable carcinomas MRI and SCT were able to obtain correct information about unresectability (sensitivity 94 %), in 7 (MRI), resp.	1.2377940502301974
8 (SCT) carcinomas were correctly considered to be resectable (sensitivity 70 % for MRI and 80 % for SCT).	1.322240816276083
The presence of vascular involvement was depicted by SCT with a sensitivity of 82-100 % and 62-100 % by MRI.	1.2125793669036256
The specificity varied between 85-100 % for SCT and 77-100 % for MRI.	1.2642972480944619
Conclusion: Both MRI and SCT are good techniques for the preoperative work-up of pancreatic carcinomas in order to obtain a correct assessment of local resectability.	1.318579292424592
Pancreatic pseudocysts occur as a complication in the natural course of acute or chronic pancreatitis, with a spontaneous resolution rate of 40 % to 60 %.	1.25670291070257
The incidence of pseudocysts in the course of chronic pancreatitis amounts to 60 %.	0.9150972940036481
Pseudocysts have to be differentiated from neoplastic or congenital pancreatic cystic lesions.	0.7861539261576544
Careful diagnostic work-up including ERCP and CT scanning is mandatory in the management of pancreatic pseudocysts.	0.8869478528390587
The indication for treatment depends on the development of symptoms or complications.	0.9236058888223475
Pain is present in up to 90 % of all patients, and the rate of complications varies between 2 % and 55 %.	1.2638408216993449
Pancreatic pseudocysts are usually an epiphenomenon of chronic pancreatitis.	0.8542811630280186
Pancreatic resection therefore represents a causative treatment.	0.5706202186756776
New percutaneous and endoscopic techniques for draining pseudocysts are challenging the previous hegemony of the surgeon.	0.8421932268202108
However, so far no prospectively collected data are available comparing the results of interventional and surgical drainage procedures.	1.3485388294249785
Therefore, in most symptomatic cases surgery is considered the treatment of choice.	1.3923255790559779
A 28-year-old drug addict who had injected intravenously died of hepatic failure and coma caused by fulminant hepatitis (simultaneously: hepatitis A, persistent hepatitis B, hepatitis C and superinfection by delta hepatitis).	0.9602438450451113
Liver histology disclosed cirrhosis with severe necrotizing hepatitis and extensive microvesicular steatosis, compatible with a delta virus infection.	0.7756063263586546
Moderate pulmonary fat embolism (grade I-II according to Falzi) was accompanied by fat deposits in alveolar macrophages.	0.9545824748076769
It is postulated that protracted fat mobilization from necrotizing hepatocytes may be the cause of pulmonary fat embolism; the extravasation of fat from the vessels into the alveoli results in phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages.	0.8888382276312656
Suicide on railways (either by being run over by or jumping in front of a train) is one of the 'hardest' suicide methods.	0.9965089363776908
In Austria, 617 suicides or attempted suicides on railways were registered between 1990 and 1994.	0.7004296466700524
This amounts to 5.73 % of all suicides committed in this period with women showing a higher percentage than men.	1.1827515711753367
In both men and women there was a predominance of younger age groups; the mean age was higher in women than in men (48.0 vs 40.4 years).	1.230408653999163
There was a significant increase in suicides or attempted suicides on railways after a television report on the stress suffered by train drivers concerning possible suicides.	0.9472660109029012
Persuading the mass media to treat the subject of 'suicide' with reserve and with greater caution, even when not presenting a distinct suicide model, may be of importance in general suicide prevention.	1.1350432706914604
For decades the results of elective lymph node dissection (ELND) are differently discussed, so that it is not definitely recommended at present the less so since the morbidity of this operation can't be neglected.	1.0765646152163506
Since the beginning of 1995 we practice a gamma-probe guided sentinel lymphonodectomy (SLNE) on patients with melanoma from a Breslow tumor thickness of 1 mm upward, after injecting a colloidal 99m-Tc labelled tin (II) - sulfid solution around the tumor or the scar, if the tumor has been excided before.	1.0249540792069503
By this method, that allows a selection of patients who according clinically to a stage I or II (UICC) but even histopathologically to a stage III and who are profiting of a removal of the regional lymph nodes, the sentinel node can be exactly localised, tissue-sparing removed at minimal complication rates and the completeness of the removal can be verified by measurements of the radioactivity.	1.1752824619888476
When finding metastases in the histopathological examination of the node a dissection of the whole region follows.	0.926536118355011
During rehabilitation of patients suffering from a recent hip fracture, we evaluated the development of several aspects of their subjective well-being (n=87, age: 70 to 94).	1.050633619132547
In most cases, a deterioration of subjective well-being due to the consequences of the hip fracture could be prevented; the well-being improved in most cases.	1.1547703813073102
When discharged, the subjective well-being of our patients was comparable to the well-being of similar-aged people living at home.	1.2442097773399752
Antidepressants are used in demented patients for treating depressive symptoms as well as other non-cognitive symptoms including agitation, aggression and irritability.	0.9186598347132346
As patients are usually elderly, a dose adjustment is mandatory for all classes of antidepressants.	1.010699370639645
New antidepressants such as the SSRIs and the reversible MAO inhibitors should be the first-line agents in these patients, because their efficacy is not different from that of classic TCA, but they have advantages regarding frequency of adverse effects, ease of use and safety.	1.1088449217416068
Improvement in cognitive performance, however, may not be expected from the new antidepressants.	1.049357800220872
For the treatment of agitation, aggression and irritabiltiy, antipychotics and benzodiazepines are in frequent use, although their adverse effects are particularly problematic in demented patiens.	0.9505117193014957
Good alternatives are the antidepressant trazodone and citalopram.	0.6628337647061795
All medications mentioned have been studied on small patient samples, so treatment recommendations must be given cautiously.	1.0311575881251502
The application of laser energy to joint capsular tissues resulted in the reduction of the joint capsule.	0.9154745556665984
Primary clinical results of combined laser-assisted capsular shrinkage (LACS) and multiple suture repair (Caspari) for arthroscopic stabilization procedure of anterior shoulder instability are presented.	1.1412573986980894
From July 1997 to October 1998, 18 patients (2 female, 16 male; mean age 27.9 years; range 16-42 years) with anterior instability and recurrent dislocations of the shoulder received a combined arthroscopic stabilization procedure.	1.2365385181756705
The operative technique involved the use of transglenoid sutures to repair the labrum and shift the capsule (Caspari) and LACS.	0.9478829053652599
Laser energy was applied using a Ho: YAG laser (10 W, 1 J, 10 pulses/s, total energy: 1500-2000 J).	1.0851764625644837
The patients were followed for an average of 9 months (range 4-20 months).	1.2426585251455742
From June 1992 to Februrary 1996, arthroscopic suture stabilization without laser shrinkage was performed on 17 patients (2 female, 15 male; age 25.9 years/range 18-37 years).	1.0776831801820288
The average follow-up in this group was 4.5 years (range 2-5.5 years), and we found 41.2% (7/17) recurrent dislocations.	1.4298388684883947
After combined arthroscopic procedure of multiple suture repair (Caspari) and LACS, a significantly (chi-squared test, P = 0.05) lower recurrence rate was obtained.	1.0124965687223646
Only in one patient (5.6%, 1/18) did we find this failure.	1.374629582342178
No complications occurred in either group.	0.32744016273516596
The combination of arthroscopic LACS and Caspari's technique of multiple suture repair in cases of posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability and recurrent dislocations is promising.	0.9978681109560793
Although, no long-term results are available, the method seems to be suitable for associating low recurrence rates with the advantages of arthroscopic surgery.	1.1827338275312402
Simple bone cysts are asymptomatic, benign lesions which are usually an incidental finding on a radiograph.	1.0431285499419225
Etiology and treatment are controversially discussed.	0.8605790525862392
The weightbearing status of the calcaneus and possible pathologic fracturing lead many authors to recommend therapeutic measures after diagnosis has been made.	0.993300441902542
We present a case report of an intact unicameral bone cyst of the calcaneus concomitant with tibial and talar fractures following crush trauma.	1.1207875916175236
Several types of treatment for simple bone cysts of the calcaneus have been suggested.	1.0479503046975704
The question whether treatment is unconditionally necessary is controversially discussed.	0.8022636650644214
It is the author's opinion, that asymptomatic bone cysts of the calcaneus require no further treatment.	1.1395836557037442
Facial neuromyography is an objective electrophysiologic measurement used to assess prognosis for recovery from facial paralysis.	0.9083405856308289
In the present study variability over time of the amplitude ratio in healthy subjects was investigated.	1.2448461242724058
Twenty healthy subjects underwent four neuromyographic tests at intervals of one week.	0.7186900331219813
The study group consisted of 12 males and 8 females.	0.9080295722396886
Ages ranged from 23 to 36 years.	0.5227264185024856
The stimulation intensity required for supramaximal stimulation was 14.6 mA on average.	0.8567909467740484
The mean of the intra-individual side-to-side difference of the evoked compound action potential was 32.5%.	0.9715957280452238
Results of the four repeated tests ranged from no to 80% side-to-side differences in the same individual.	1.0709869503640153
The hypothesis of symmetrical evoked facial compound potentials was not supported by our data.	0.7773514424752662
As with previous investigators we found significant side-to-side differences in healthy subjects.	0.8761572012031128
Furthermore, we could also show for the first time that the amplitude ratio was not constant in every individual at repeated measurements.	1.225704409522047
We conclude that there is a physiological variability that must be taken into account in the interpretation of facial nerve neuromyography.	1.0421826335765694
To compare patient dose and image quality of electron-beam-CT vs. spiral-CT by means of phantom measurements.	1.0202795223474923
An EBCT scanner (C-150 XP) and a spiral-CT scanner (GE  HiSpeed Advantage) were used to scan three different phantoms.	1.216030332238202
Administered dose, high contrast (HC) resolution, low contrast (LC) lesion detectability and the width of the radiation beams were measured.	1.0238708858146677
EBCT showed 25-35% lower HC resolution in comparison to spiral-CT. LC lesion detectability showed equivalent results for S/N vs. patient dose using 3 mm collimation with EBCT and spiral-CT, whereas spiral-CT was superior for 1,5 and 6 mm collimation.	1.0867357333227106
Dose measurements revealed a 2 fold higher patient dose using EBCT with 1,5 mm or 6 mm collimation compared to spiral-CT using equivalent scan parameters.	0.9651703363502383
No differences were seen using 3 mm collimation.	0.885697222921061
Differences were due to insufficient beamside collimation of the EBCT.	0.6816026021922101
The use of EBCT with 6 mm collimation should be avoided, because of impaired performance.	1.1437053370207184
Using 3 mm collimation, EBCT showed comparable performance like state of the art spiral-CT despite lower HC resolution.	0.9528912931688099
In an experimental study, the biomechanical qualities of the combined Kirschner wire osteosynthesis (KWO) in the unstable Colles' fracture were analyzed.	1.0579389662140937
This type of pin fixation is our preferred osteosynthesis in the treatment of unstable Colles' fracture because it allows immediate functional therapy.	0.9879515140755667
It represents a modification of Kapandji's dynamic KWO, compensating for the insufficient volar stability by means of the conventional static KWO.	0.9318974632588088
Clinical experience according to the anatomical and functional results, was very encouraging suggesting that a clinical concept based on the biomechanical principles of combined KWO and its single components should be constituted.	1.139263594934345
Simulation of the unstable Colles' fracture was realized by dorsal wedge osteotomy of the distal end of the radius using cadaveric material.	0.9289418265742264
This fracture model was subsequently pinned using the different KWO types and tested by a standardized vector energy testing device regarding its stability in the four main loading directions.	0.9885313398001707
The combined KWO unifies the advantage of volar stability of the conventional KWO with the high dorsal stability of dynamic KWO.	1.0096678621511914
The main functional principle of dynamic KWO with regard to its axial stability consists in the repositioning of the dorsal bone fragmentation zone and hence the reconstitution of cortical load transmission.	0.9462953365462241
Besides its good stabilization, dynamic KWO also leads to optimal alignment of the distal metaphyseal fragment.	0.980183683008677
Furthermore, the experiments yielded important information about technical aspects of the surgical procedure, which helps us to avoid anatomical and functional deficiencies.	1.1161732361858927
Based on these experimental findings, the surgical technique of combined KWO was standardized.	1.287965775827545
Purpose: It is difficult to measure the topography of the cornea with high resolution and visualize it on a map displaying refraction.	1.1746044915266538
This is demonstrated by the ongoing improvement and further development of different methods and by the fact that users of these techniques are not always satisfied.	1.225514340957946
We present the case of a 2-year-old boy who was brought to hospital with extensive scalding of the face.	1.0946111631445261
The clinicians raised the suspicion of a physical maltreatment of the child.	0.7754157224569549
Because of the morphological findings the medico-legal expert came to the conclusion that maltreatment was proven.	0.9069008725409727
During the criminal proceedings at the appeal court contrary opinions on the morphological findings of the injury between the clinical expert and the medico-legal expert became obvious.	1.035993875282938
Findings of the physical examination of the child and the experimental studies on immersion and pouring of water and the influence of clothing in case of wetting with hot water were presented which confirmed that the injury was caused by maltreatment.	0.9787561262817487
The opinion of the clinical expert which supported the case of the accused could be refuted.	1.1668878804388239
During the final legal proceedings the opinions of the clinical expert had been sufficient for the court to justify an acquittal "in dubio pro reo".	0.9568438468877929
Anterior thoracoscopic interbody stabilization and fusion was performed in 163 patients.	0.8412590207353013
Lesions treated were located between T4 and L3, most frequently occuring at T12/L2.	0.9293574288685497
Operative time decreased dramatically as experience was gained with the procedure.	0.7350084101600064
2 patients early in the series successfully were converted to an open procedure.	0.707648044263973
One positioning related pressure harm on the thoracodorsal nerve and one irritation of the L1 root at the entrance site were both transitory.	0.8148740980287578
Postoperative control by X-ray and CTscan showed correct positioning of the bone graft, as well as the fixation device in all patients.	1.1770560911463948
Our experience with this minimally invasive procedure demonstrated the feasibility of the method.	0.8864906287578499
Major advantages compared to the open procedure are reduced morbidity of the approach, postoperative pain reduction, early recovery of function and shortened hospital stay.	1.1196699695539103
In order to restore function and esthetics in mandibular hypoplasia, transplantation of osteochondral grafts and the distraction osteogenesis technique are used alternatively.	0.915661783073763
In a retrospective study the indication, growth and complication rate of osteochondral graft and distraction osteogenesis cases in mandibular hypoplasia were compared.	1.0515091399187948
In total, 12 patients (4-14 years old; 7 female, 5 male) with different grades of mandibular hypoplasia received osteochondral grafts (7 costochondral, 5 iliac crest; observation period 4-9 years).	1.1546875928431073
In 5 patients (10-12 years old; 1 female, 4 male), distraction osteogenesis was performed (observation period 10 months to 3 1/2 years).	1.205847288432158
In the results, according to the literature, the range of growth after osteochondral grafting varied considerably, approximate normal growth was noticed in only two cases.	0.9292347851328893
On the other hand, all patients treated by distraction osteogenesis showed a stable increase of bone length as expected.	1.0830023574394378
After osteochondral grafts, adequate growth is to be expected in the minority of cases and it does not seem predictable in individual cases.	1.0385926886772627
Therefore, the indication for osteochondral grafts should be restricted to severe hypoplasia, where the local amount of bone does not allow the use of a distraction device, and to cases where support of the mandibula at the skull base is necessary.	1.1491408093436164
In all other cases of mandibular hypoplasia in children, distraction osteogenesis should be discussed as the primary option, even if in the long term a second surgical procedure should be necesssary.	1.1626899105439734
To evaluate the predictive value of MRI in the early postoperative course after cruciate ligament replacement, a prospective study was performed.	1.287890808196621
Twenty patients with reconstructed anterior and/or posterior cruciate ligament were examined clinically and with contrast-enhanced MRI 2, 12, 24 weeks, 1 and 2 years postoperatively.	1.1847638340018785
The clinical examinations were evaluated according to the scores by Lysholm, OAK and IKDC.	0.7667788104199411
The MRI scans (SP 63, 1.5 Tesla) were evaluated regarding the quality and signal intensity of the reconstructed ligament.	1.2355498267824367
During the first postoperative year a significant increase in signal intensity and inhomogeneity of the neoligament in MRI was observed in 16 patients with an average value for signal/noise of 1.1 2 weeks postoperatively up to 6.9 1 year postoperatively.	1.2506076694511403
In 12 patients the reconstructed ligament could not be evaluated in the 1-year postoperative MRI, whereas none of these patients was suspected clinically of having instability.	1.2070957074110844
In the 2-year postoperative MRI, the signal intensity of the neoligament was found to be decreasing again with improvement in judgement.	1.0819802833467196
Miniplate osteosynthesis is a standard method for the surgical treatment of mandible fractures today.	1.0348757145934149
Apart from easy handling, in the majority of cases it also ensures adequate fracture stability.	1.1060326462383487
The treatment of fractures of very atrophic mandibles as well as mandibular defects and comminuted fractures with miniplates and rigid plates is often difficult or only possible to an inadequate extent.	1.041584868175876
Titanium mesh has proved successful for the treatment of such fractures.	0.9645609943229232
Compared with conventional miniplates this mesh is outstanding for its considerably higher stability due to its given geometry.	0.8767895749331235
The titanium mesh can be adapted and screwed individually in any situation, in contrast to miniplates and rigid plates.	0.9922202921300559
As a result, complications such as fracture gap infections and pseudoarthrosis can be avoided to a great extent.	1.0212118095848661
Non-invasive methods to identify absent or persistent myocardial viability have gained increasing importance in the therapeutic management and risk stratification of patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction.	1.0656258193377386
Myocardial scintigraphy using thallium-201 and positron emission tomography with metabolic imaging of myocardial glucose metabolism, using fluorine-18 fluoro-deoxyglucose, are today the most widely used nuclear methods for the assessment of myocardial viability.	0.9792362076282661
Besides the prediction of reversible regional and global myocardial dysfunction following coronary revascularization, both methods have demonstrated the ability to identify patient subgroups who will benefit most with regard to cardiac prognosis and survival and those patients in whom coronary revascularization has a limited effect with regard to survival and cardiac events.	1.0728223259899559
This short review summarizes the clinical impact of both imaging modalities on todays diagnostic approach in patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction.	0.8047534676393779
An elderly woman was found dead in her farm house lying in a pool of blood and was partially unclothed.	0.8828429590431942
Blood was also discovered in several rooms on the first floor.	0.9284679940739237
The investigation at the scene led to the conclusion of a sexual murder.	1.1978981636097574
The autopsy however revealed the source of the hemorrhage to be a renal artery aneurysm which had ruptured in the adjacent renal pelvis.	1.0890510310847759
The woman has obviously been surprised by the sudden bleeding which produced the impressive pattern of blood stains on the floor and finally a fatal hemorrhage.	0.8719403474766158
A similar case of a ruptured renal artery aneurysm and bleeding to death via the urinary tract has not yet been described.	1.140518327548525
In the ankle (talocrural) joint, the lower end of the tibia and fibula embrace the trochlea tali.	1.1973289042681552
Thus, an approximately uniaxial joint is formed which permits dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of the foot against the leg.	1.1331232682874137
Due to the geometry of the trochlea tali, conjunct lateral rotation of the fibula against the tibia occurs at the tibiofibular articulations synchronously with active dorsiflexion at the ankle joint.	0.9122808387688373
Movements at the talocrural joints are mainly limited by the opposing muscles as well as by strong collateral ligaments.	0.9629614149755593
Talus and calcaneus form a functional unit connected by posterior and anterior articulations.	0.843101079241109
The posterior articulation is the subtalar (talocalcaneal) joint; in the anterior articulation, talar facets of the calcaneus together with the posterior surface of the navicular and the superior fibrocartilaginous surface of the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament form a concavity for the talar head.	1.0642219780697024
Thus, the talocalcaneonavicular joint is a compound and - like the subtalar joint - a multiaxial articulation.	1.2304644467015833
On the weight-bearing foot, the distal tarsus and metatarsus are pronated and supinated against the talus in order to maintain plantigrade contact.	0.9408531132293496
When the foot is off the ground, these movements are modified to eversion and inversion, also involving the calcaneocuboid joint.	0.9906250518340478
In addition, movements between the calcaneus and cuboid also occur during pronative or supinative changes between the fore- and hindfoot.	1.1012617017741828
Limitation of movements is due to leg muscles as well as strong ligaments.	0.7424999088354886
Finally, the cuneonavicular, cuboideonavicular, intercuneiform and cuneocuboid joints permit some additional alterations of the loaded foot in contact with the ground.	0.9077567234912076
A case of primary splenic angiosarcoma with involvement of two accessory spleens is presented.	0.9405953125259435
The tumor cells are immunoreactive for endothelial markers (CD 31, CD 34, factor VIII associated antigen) and express also histiocytic antigens (CD 68, lysozyme, Cathepsin D, alpha-1-antitrypsin, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin) as well as CD 8.	1.0157719859622576
This marker profile suggests that the presented angiosarcoma originates from sinus cells with  histiocytic and endothelial differentiation and may be regarded as the malignant variant of littoral cells angioma.	0.9503724560719065
Despite major advances in knowledge and development of efficient techniques for pain control, many patients on surgical wards suffer from modest to severe pain following surgery or trauma.	0.960141850650596
Therefore, in the University Hospital of Kiel, Germany, an anaesthesiology-based acute pain service (APS) was started in 1985 to improve this situation.	1.2293371599548666
The anaesthesiologist in training who manages the recovery unit serves as an APS for surgical wards and is supervised by a consultant.	0.9233305215892006
The anaesthesists on call are responsible after regular working hours.	0.6874862956106212
The activities of the APS are as follows: 1.	0.7766527576335956
Induction of sufficient postoperative analgesia in the recovery unit for all surgical patients.	0.8955570629257037
Clinical rounds on all patients receiving epidural analgesia (EA), other forms of regional analgesia, or patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) every morning and throughout the day if necessary.	1.102734693615158
Additional consultations for postoperative pain management for other patients on request.	1.0088745003764774
Assessment and documentation of the clinical status of the patient, quality of analgesia, and side effects.	1.0497529392304314
Writing orders for further treatment.	0.5530618451245979
Continuing consultations and informal education for ward nurses, physiotherapists, and surgical staff; formal medical training for ward nurses in postoperative pain management.	0.9502787284097746
From 1985 to 1992, 1947 patients on normal wards were treated (EA: 1736, PCA: 183).	0.9042417634394233
Epidural analgesia was performed using a standard protocol with bupivacaine 0.175% - 0.25% infused continuously with top-ups if needed (mean 240 mg/day, range 75 - 600 mg; median duration 7 days, range 1 - 53, Table 1).	1.1772576587323964
Demand for further treatment was proved by day-to-day withdrawal.	0.913278912123505
Since the introduction of an APS, complications of EA such as hypotension (1985/1986: 5.1%; 1987/1992: 0.5%, Table 3) and insufficient analgesia due to dislocation or other technical complications could be reduced significantly (Table 3).	1.2036587938212937
Dermal infections were seen in 2.6% of patients, with a significantly higher incidence in patients with arteriosclerotic diseases (4.1%).	1.2076134619211618
Epidural opioids were used in only 46 selected cases on surgical wards.	0.8595358728759934
Nevertheless, 2 cases of marked respiratory depression occurred.	1.3420753607693643
The overall risk of complications during postoperative EA could be reduced from 1 : 11 cases in the first 2 years to 1 : 20 in the last 6 years since introducing the APS.	1.1790055634393535
For other regional procedures (e.g., interpleural analgesia) no complications were recorded.	0.9028762172999827
PCA was performed using a standard protocol with tramadol or piritramide without background infusion (Table 6).	0.9433211746309328
The loading dose was titrated in the recovery unit.	0.8186837787433582
The median duration of PCA was 4 days (range 1 - 23); the median dose of piritramide was 45 mg/day (range 3 - 226 mg).	1.1771477011959224
Two cases of somnolence and respiratory depression occurred.	0.7758911280742811
In this period there were 8 potential life-threatening complications due to postoperative pain therapy; 4 occurred during standard surgical pain management (3 cases of severe respiratory depression after i.m.	1.2342787240932411
piritramide (unsuccessfull resuscitation), tramadol, and buprenorphine; 1 small child with multiorgan failure after paracetamol intoxication).	1.014792798369834
In those cases the APS was not involved.	0.7913048938995079
There are insufficient data for comparison of the incidence of complications following standard management of postoperative pain relief without an APS, i.e., i.m.	1.147182467698087
injections of opioids on request, but severe and sometimes lethal complications have been reported.	0.9760692113712575
Since the majority of patients used EA or PCA for several days, it is again emphasised that these techniques should not be restricted to high-dependency areas such as intensive care or recovery units.	1.1164540986917693
The introduction of an APS is an adequate approach to more efficient and safer pain management on surgical wards.	0.8910010316743019
This requires standard protocols (Table 7), standardised monitoring and trained ward nurses.	1.1479632615093573
Lambdoid synostosis can manifest unilaterally, bilaterally or in combination with other craniosynostoses.	0.8161371806444903
Using the concept of fronto-orbital advancement we developed occipital advancement in order to correct unilateral or bilateral lambdoid synostosis.	0.9062776860551213
The process involves striped transversal osteotomy, removal, remodelling and advancement of the occipital region.	0.8200996453481221
It allows precise, reproducible and predictable positioning of the segments.	0.8563353188381145
Artificial sutures are created as a result of the osteotomy.	0.8708378561165084
The remodelling leads to a well-proportioned skull shape and advancement to an increase in the intracranial volume.	0.9104049481865459
This article presents the operative method and the results of 14 patients.	1.1022969148449666
Melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy is a rare neoplasm of neural crest origin.	0.9601284606522918
It almost always occurs in children younger than one year of age with a predilection for the anterior maxillary ridge.	0.9723493948592766
Although it usually follows a benign course, local destruction as well as metastasis and death may result from the tumor.	1.0998894792781455
Melanotic neuroectodermal tumor is most commonly treated by surgery.	0.813228535078433
10-15% of the lesions recur.	1.4852656111982223
We report the case of a 2-month-old infant suffering from melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy of the premaxilla who was successfully treated with a combination of various chemotherapeutic agents in order to spare the child a mutilating operation or the late effects of radiation.	1.005345568279925
Computer-assisted techniques were introduced in spine surgery in the 1990s to improve accuracy and safety of operative procedures.	1.0498918341467476
Several reports on clinical results of computer-aided screw insertion in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine as well as the sacro-iliac joints are available.	1.2186281408684263
They show a significant decrease of screw malplacement rates as compared to conventional insertion techniques.	1.0275780854564365
Over the past years, antioxidants, and particularly vitamin E, have received considerable attention in the treatment of human diseases.	1.2154501626882857
In rheumatology, interest has been given to the treatment and prevention of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.	1.1433606035144488
However, the concept of using antioxidant nutrients as potential remedies is not new.	0.9354028093412868
As early as the sixties, first case reports have described beneficial effects of vitamin E in the therapy of osteoarthritis.	0.9919295883999292
Nonetheless, most of the following studies were not conducted properly, thus, not allowing valid inferences about the efficacy of vitamin E. Newer studies with sound methodology have shown a beneficial effect in rheumatic diseases, mainly in the reduction of pain.	1.2291186087770896
This paper reviews current and past studies about vitamin E in the treatment of rheumatic diseases.	1.0081590302928192
Patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (i.v.-PCA) represents the gold standard in the management of acute postoperative pain.	0.9434574783295677
However, in many countries i.v.-PCA is rarely used.	1.2433625102261974
Recent clinical studies demonstrated that intranasal fentanyl titration provides a rapid and safe form and pain management.	0.9502031984858001
In the present study we investigated patients' acceptance and assessment of patient-controlled intranasal analgesia (PCINA) and compared it to intravenous PCA and the customarily prescribed pain therapy.	1.0828141033509802
Unreamed nailing with solid tibial nails is an accepted method of treatment for open tibial shaft fractures up to grade III and of closed tibial fractures with severe soft tissue damage.	1.0055240747032346
However, fatigue failure of the distal locking bolts is a frequent complication.	1.534648380202743
We report a mechanical study investigating the fatigue limit of six different types of locking bolts used in solid tibial nails (Biorigid Tibial nail/aap, UTN/ace, STN/Howmedica, TLN/Howmedica, R & T Tibial nail/Smith & Nephew, AO/ASIF UTN/Synthes).	0.9053204754463202
Our results prove a direct correlation between the bolt's diameter and mechanical properties.	0.8719556069731664
Further more we found that bolts with a continuing thread were weaker than bolts of the same diameter with only a short thread and an increased diameter at the nail's aperture.	1.0479489012836185
Our results suggest that mobilization with half of the average body weight (350N) allows osseous consolidation without fatigue failure of any of the tested locking bolts.	0.9352423680257071
Some of the tested locking bolts may even withstand full weight-bearing in a physiological walking cycle, but will not withstand the stress of a running cycle.	0.9843319475695346
Voiding dysfunctions secondary to failure of adequate relaxation of the striated urinary sphincter or the smooth bladder neck should be considered in children with urinary day time incontinence and/or enuresis and recurrent urinary tract infections.	1.0089335025741215
The urodynamic findings resemble to those obtained in neuropathic bladders, but only a minority of the children suffer from neurologic disorders or anatomical obstruction.	1.1132698237252963
In the majority of cases a developmental delay of the central nervous system responsible for urinary control is assumed.	0.9750203675711149
Behavioural disturbances play another important etiological role.	0.6118051787861042
Therapy is based on behavioural modification.	0.5415146410202849
We report on two patients with granulomatous rosacea and another patient with granulomatous perioral dermatitis who responded well to dapsone.	0.949812888169115
Dapsone has a pharmacological double function as both an antibiotic and an antiphlogistic drug.	0.8481321516449222
Before the introduction of isotretinoin, dapsone had its place in the treatment of severe acne.	0.9800669351712368
To date, its use in granulomatous rosacea has not been described.	1.079394810529134
When hematologic parameters are monitored, dapsone is considered a safe and cost-effective drug, especially in countries where isotretinoin is not readily available.	1.1224504428452766
However, the definite value of dapsone in granulomatous rosacea should be established by a controlled study.	0.9786703963960526
Anaesthesia both for adenotomy (AT) and for tonsillectomy (TE) frequently presents a challenge.	1.1078917261049
On one hand, children scheduled for adenotomy often have upper airway infections and are thus at risk of laryngo- and bronchospasm; on the other hand the ENT surgeon and the anaesthetist have to share the "workspace" in the patient's mouth.	1.2618998379875355
Since the succinyl choline debate in the early 1990s, the question of the best muscle relaxant has gone hand in hand with that of the most appropriate means of securing the airway.	1.1259358241849384
The concept of the laryngeal mask as airway was initially greeted with scepticism.	0.8648963369741453
Following several years' use of the mask for this purpose in AT and TE in young children, we report our experience and summarise the literature on this topic.	1.2038771323732191
The laryngeal mask represents a safe alternative to intubation, provided there is close cooperation with the ENT surgeon.	1.0525903881792884
Topical corticosteroids (CS) are frequently used to treat of allergic contact dermatitis, so that their own potential for sensitization is rarely detected.	1.1294774007530681
However, increasing numbers of hypersensitivity reactions to corticosteroids have been reported during the last 10 years, and allergic skin reactions to over 50 particular compounds have been observed.	1.2990213747648105
CS must now be regarded as a rather frequent contact allergen, the prevalence being twice as high in women as in men.	1.1090385844997424
Contact allergy to CS is clinically characterized by a chronic and persistent, corticosteroid-resistant dermatitis.	0.8856981098299945
In general, hypersensitivity to CS is a type I and/or type IV mediated allergic reaction.	0.9231782599363647
Cross-sensitivity between individual corticosteroid preparations has been described owing to their closely related chemical structures (e.g.	0.7943568184959172
hydrocortisone and tixocortol pivalate).	0.46444570852355543
Contact allergy to CS can be confirmed by patch-tests, intradermal injection tests or application tests; because of the delayed appearance of positive skin reactions a prolonged evaluation period of up to 120 h is recommended.	0.9041202162994336
For routine screening the use of the patient's own material and of tixocortol pivalate and budesonide as test marker substances seems appropriate.	1.0242729861455007
The development of further marker substances is a target for ongoing research.	0.8825965281498921
The alliance concepts are defined as being the description of the dynamic interaction of all cognitive and emotional factors which promote the analytic process.	0.9963604216996754
The historical significance and the development of the three predominant alliance concepts, these being the implicit "standard alliance" of Freud, Zetzel's therapeutic alliance and Greenson's working alliance, are to be described.	1.0998908832193535
All alliance concepts refer to a general, essentially reality-oriented relationship anchored in the personal and the human domain, which forms the background for the therapeutic process and the basis for the analytic interpretation work.	1.1606997692300887
Nonetheless, the dynamic force of the alliances is substantiated by factors of the transference.	1.1168752938261775
The alliances are therefore not faced with the transference, but rather with the resistance.	1.0966678077811751
We report on a 15-months-old girl with a history of recurrent phlegmones of the lower eyelid, dacryocystitides, conjunctivities and mucositis together with growth-retardation, chronic obstipation and anal prolaps.	1.054909288229658
During a period of 19 days absolute neutropenia was observed.	0.7782466745171347
Retrospectively, neutrophil counts were between 0-500/µl from birth on.	0.857610236481007
Bone marrow biopsy revealed an arrest of maturation of granulopoiesis at the stage of promyelocytes.	0.8667514973430068
Continuous therapy with 10  µg/kg/d of recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) induced 12-day oscillations of blood neutrophil counts.	1.0973975153288127
There were no oscillations of counts of other blood cell lines.	1.0098483913198353
Growth retardation and prolaps of anus normalized, and few intercurrent bacterial infections, pneumonia and impetigo contagiosa occurred.	0.8586975829297576
A mutation in the G-CSF-receptor gene was not found in this patient.	1.0427447434051735
After 2 years of therapy, a reduction of rhG-CSF dose (application every 2 days) lead to a severe neutropenia.	1.0154278257545943
We report a 31-year-old renal transplant patient treated with cyclosporin A who developed an unusual sebaceous gland hyperplasia accompanied by a disseminated follicular spiny hyperkeratosis.	1.1258059191990173
Those alterations were most evident on his face and limbs.	0.7410222125571259
In some locations hairy hyperkeratosis with authentic hair neogenesis was found.	0.5996214176195654
The histology of these alterations showed a marked hyperkeratosis of the hair follicles with formation of hair-like spikes either alone or in connection with hairs.	1.0724094144817253
The presence of true hairs distinguishes our case from the morphologically similar disseminated spiked hyperkeratosis and other spiny keratinization disorders.	0.80944304089754
Scanning electron microscopy helped to demonstrate the hair-like structure of these keratoses.	0.8950058317934084
Some of the sebaceous glands showed cystic widening of their lumina, which were filled with abundant amorphous eosinophilic material, a finding similar to earlier observations.	1.077028091919256
Our case demonstrates that these skin alterations should be classified as side effects of cyclosporin A and that they are apparently dose-dependent.	0.9080408751074747
Background: Since increased intraoperative iris irritation can lead to increased postoperative inflammation, we are interested in postoperative reactions to several varied surgical procedures.	1.141213457790167
We performed pupil stretching, iridotomy with iris suture, and partial sphincterectomy.	0.9325765202990163
Reports of accidental alkaloid-intoxications with plants of the nightshade family, in  particular Datura-species are well known in pediatric care.	0.938525715861793
The intentional abuse as a hallucinogenic drug in adolescents became more frequent in recent years.	0.8167825727534014
Two patients, a 14- resp.	0.9406216248916571
16-year old boy were admitted to the intensive care units of our hospitals  because of a severe central anticholinergic syndrome after ingestion of tea from Angel's Trumpet blossoms for experimental reasons.	1.119779370526928
Patient's history in the first somnolent patient was not available at the time of admission, a routine immunological drug screening of the patient's urine had been negative.	1.2642366841918053
In the present case of a granular cell tumor an abdomino-thoracal resection of the esophagus was performed in a 41-year-old patient after preoperative diagnosis had suggested esophageal cancer.	1.2652500148034802
Granular cell tumors (Abrikossoff's tumor) of the esophagus are rather rare tumors of neuroectodermal benign histogenesis.	1.0920753515574715
Diagnosis can be obtained by endoscopic and histological study and immunohistochemical forceps biopsy.	0.9663505869853789
Because of the peculiar histological feature of the tumor, it can be mistaken for an squamous cell carcinoma.	0.9748082231246339
In the guidelines for determination of the blood alcohol level for forensic purposes, a correction factor of 1.2 has been established for the conversion of serum alcohol into blood alcohol based on the relationship of the water content between serum and whole blood.	1.260221453470991
The reliability of the determination of the blood alcohol level is dependent on the possible minimum and maximum values of this correction factor.	0.9400830024398336
In a comprehensive multicenter study consisting of 833 samples, which can be considered representative of persons involved in offences under the drinking and driving act, an average quotient of 1.16 was found with minimum and maximum values of 1.08 and 1.21 respectively.	1.1132098320330166
In 96% of the cases the quotient was between 1.13 and 1.19 and the deviation of the quotient from the average value was less than 3%.	1.1826889074420746
From these results it can be assumed that the determination of blood alcohol is obviously more reliable than previously presumed.	1.0664720328566035
In Germany, if the dermatologist has definite proof that a patient's skin disorder is severe or chronic, work-related and requiring a change in occupation, then he or she must issue a Berufskrankheitenanzeige (loosely translated as occupational disease notification).	1.0299518204945823
The patient's consent is not required for this mandatory form, which has to be submitted even if the patient is opposed.	1.2780116760425515
On the other hand, if there is only a possible connection between the occupation and the skin disorder, or if the skin disease is neither severe nor chronic nor threatening pursuit of the occupation, then the dermatologist needs only write a Hautarztbericht (dermatologist's report).	1.0821723813564808
The patient's permission is required for this less formal document.	1.0354723498333167
Bone marrow involvement is often observed in patients with hematological malignancies and solid tumors.	0.9280903389198907
Sensitive immunological and molecular biological methods allow the detection of isolated transformed cells in bone marrow samples.	0.8498243030354993
Like normal hematopoietic cells, tumor cells interact with bone marrow stroma through adhesion molecules.	0.9030658446828554
Since adhesion mulecules play an essential role in the invasion and proliferation of malignant cells, new therapeutic approaches involving the inhibition of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions are conceivable.	0.9494138936869551
With the development of powerful computer systems, computer-assisted medical diagnosis and therapy have become common over the last 10 years.	1.011615721100351
Even in the surgical field, computer- and robotic-assisted techniques are becoming practical but are not yet used on a daily basis.	1.0392967229770158
In the orthopaedic field, computer and robotic assistance is used in planning and performing demanding three-dimensional osteotomies, setting pedicle screws in the spine and milling the femoral medullary canal in total hip replacement.	1.0005729069613138
This article introduces a computer- and robotic-assisted system for performing arthroplasty in total knee replacement procedures.	0.9130208197254145
The hand is very exposed to injuries in the daily man's work.	0.9505502608729754
The multiple functions of the hand are based on vitality, sensibility, motor function and stability.	0.9797411856800968
In severe hand injuries the functional results of the repair are often very poor.	1.071035930843007
In a complex injury of the hand we are faced with the damage of the soft tissue and bone and the loss of vitality and function of the hand.	1.027824673370582
The cause of hand injuries are mainly a crush trauma or the rotating saw.	0.8689437542382739
Basically, we recommend an extended primary repair.	1.3216489898147303
After the radical debridement we have to reconstruct the damaged structures.	0.8281344553271827
We start doing the osteosynthesis and stabilization of the joints.	0.8760942348072618
Thereafter, suturing of extensor and flexor tendons.	0.8027431321857146
Then, we do the microsurgical reconstructions of vessels and nerves.	1.0269023765359706
In case tendons and bones are exposed we have to cover the defect with a pedicled or a free flap.	0.9415100977798018
In a long ischemic time we have to change our concept and do the reconstruction of the vessels first.	1.1162846775400688
Our results in vitality and sensibility are listed.	0.63415063457566
In the result of a complex hand injury each single functional restoration is very important.	1.0124093053561902
Therefore, it is necessary that severe hand injuries are treated at well established centres for hand surgery.	1.1671071128049406
A 34-year-old women had a hen's egg-sized supernumerary mammary gland with no nipple or areola in the left anterior axillary line for the last 8 years.	0.9731690935008639
The main complaint about the axillary "lump" was that it was aesthetically displeasing, and it was excised.	1.160223802037729
The importance of an axillary breast lies in the possibility that pathologic changes could develop in its substance and that clinically it could be confused with a lipoma.	0.9845144213441281
Early diagnosis and correct excision are usually recommended.	0.7789901928348728
Paclitaxel and docetaxel are potent drugs that are effective in the treatment of malignant tumors.	0.9080709036291594
The cytotoxic action of these drugs is not fully understood, but it appears to be mediated mainly through mitotic arrest and subsequent apoptosis.	1.126700111883804
Because no information is available on the antiangiogenesis action of docetaxel, the investigations were performed to determine whether inhibition of neoangiogenesis plays a role in docetaxel's antitumor efficacy.	1.1023182229387194
Four different mouse tumors, two squamous cell carcinomas (SCC-IV; SCC-VII) and two adenocarcinomas (MCA-4; MCA-29) were assayed for angiogenic activity using the in vivo i.c.	1.0366485843481226
Tumor cells (5 x 105) were injected i.c.	1.190869500308984
into the skin flap over the abdominal wall, and the number of new blood vessels at the tumor cell injection site was determined 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 days later.	1.2153606201896223
The mice were treated with docetaxel (Taxotere - 31.3 mg/kg i.v.)	0.9692922106039469
1 or 4 days after tumor cell injection.	0.8854771706956622
The number of new blood vessels increased with time.	0.7582848321362428
Docetaxel reduced the number of newly formed blood vessels in MCAs, but not in SCCs.	1.2188912319102654
The reduction was associated with slower tumor growth.	0.6329123359165066
In a separate set of experiments we observed that docetaxel's inhibitory effect on the two MCAs was histologically associated with massive tumor cell destruction by means of both apoptosis and necrosis.	0.9592690523557271
This was not observed for the two SCCs.	1.1483175228574092
Since no reduction in blood vessels occurred in tumors unresponsive to docetaxel, the inhibition of neoangiogenesis in docetaxel-responsive tumors was likely the result of a decrease in angiogenic stimuli due to docetaxel's destruction of tumor cells.	0.9857943325427547
A patient on long term parenteral nutrition developed acrodermatitis enteropathica-like skin changes.	0.7649375097583934
Just as in the autosomal recessive disorder, acrodermatitis enteropathica, the lesions in our patient were caused by zinc deficiency.	1.0720709257083532
Replacement therapy with zinc led to rapid improvement.	0.6598665991410747
A measurement system was developed that permits objective comparisons of the sound conduction of middle ear implants.	0.8712693595575015
The implants are fitted into a mechanical middle ear model which approximates the impedances of the eardrum and the inner ear.	0.7931173838463033
A defined signal within the frequency range of 0-5 kHz is provided by a miniaturized loudspeaker at the input to the model and is  measured by a probe microphone.	1.0488312897284755
Displacement of an artificial stapes footplate at the output of the model is measured by a fiberoptic probe with a sensitivity of 5 nm.	0.9147886312949491
The transmission function is calculated as the quotient of the output and the input signal.	0.8689049449984886
This system can be used to evaluate the sound-transmitting properties of different middle ear implants excepting other influences, such as surgical techniques.	1.032601834085531
This work details the measurement system and demonstrates basic influences on the sound-transmission of middle ear implants.	0.8434615412295964
In acute myocardial infarction intracoronary stenting is superior to PTCA regarding interventional success and occurrence of cardiac events.	0.7341860493993891
It is, however, uncertain whether myocardial function also improves with stenting.	0.9211533607799733
We, therefore, assessed angiographic parameters of myocardial function in patients with acute myocardial infarction who were treated with primary PTCA and received additional stenting in case of an unsatisfactory angiographic result (provisional stenting).	1.2152051791936371
In order to perform accurate low-flow anaesthesia ventilation, it is desirable to avoid the influence of fresh gas flow (FGF) and inspiration duration (ID) on the resulting minute volume (MV).	1.2107118783052624
The Sulla 808V anaesthesia ventilator (Draeger, Luebeck, Germany) is originally not equipped with a fresh-gas decoupling (FGD) device.	0.937959725094755
Therefore, changes of FGF and ID settings applied during controlled ventilation may lead to alterations of the resulting MV.	1.1090432862758075
Recently, a low-cost FGD device (Carbamed, Bern-Liebefeld, Switzerland) has been developed, which can be inserted into the circle system.	0.9849660974891178
We investigated the effect of this device on MV in the Sulla 808V anaesthesia apparatus.	0.8985639288066402
Background: In a multicenter study the association of psychosocial stress and the use of psychosocial support in patients with diabetes mellitus was evaluated.	1.1404917554395821
The diagnosis Prader-Willi-Syndrome (PWS) in the neonate is difficult because features like neonatal hypotonia and feeding problems are easily misdiagnosed as a consequence of peripartal asphyxia.	1.0037288203332515
Craniofacial abnormalities like narrow bifrontal diameter, almond shaped palpebral fissures and openend downturned mouth are underdiagnosed especially if respiratory treatment is necessary.	0.7174821305814194
Hypogonadism in girls and in milder expression in boys (for example cryptorchism) are common and unspecific signs at that age.	1.049759134198424

Diagnostic criteria and therapeutic intervention are discussed.	0.8540544831285264
Hydrops fetalis as a seldom feature in PWS has to be taken into consideration.	0.6645875603574705
Diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) are an instrument for classification of inpatient cases.	1.1116428740293927
DRGs are finding ever broader implementation internationally.	0.4948951333771368
Targets for using DRGs are hospital financing and budgeting, cost accounting and quality assurance.	0.8562275056681949
The present survey covering 18 countries shows that so far DRGs are most frequently used for budgeting purposes.	0.971870737051872
In addition to DRG-based reimbursement, further quality assurance is necessary, but this is only being implemented with hesitation.	1.1600504748279903
The coverage planned for all inpatient cases through DRG-based reimbursement in Germany from 2003 on is a pioneering challenge internationally.	0.8717826523754141

Sinde the introduction of the bladder drainage technique, the number of pancreas transplants performed has now reached 1000/year worldwide.	0.9976711573334827
Most of these transplants have been performed in the United States.	0.9155927854868988
In contrast, the number of pancreas transplants performed in the Eurotransplant community has remained at a low level for several years.	0.9509576710893418
The results of a consecutive series of 20 simultaneous pancreas/kidney grafts (SPK) performed between June 1994 and October 1995 demonstrate that high graft function rates of 83.5 % for pancreas and kidney grafts can be achieved.	1.120609337085497
Therefore SPK can be recommended as a standard procedure for patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease in Germany, too.	1.0226715412784508
Intubation and Positive End Expiratory Pressure Ventilation (PEEP) is a well established therapeutic strategy for impaired lung function, particularly following blunt chest trauma.	1.1036255084117812
Complications of this regime are however also well known and pose the question why non-invasive forms of respiratory assistance such as Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) have only gained minor popularity.	1.0605759791306049
In a prospective study, 30 patients who had suffered blunt chest trauma were treated with CPAP administered by mask.	1.0899350941128065
The regime consisted of continuous administration of CPAP by a face-mask, with gradually increasing periods of spontaneous breathing.	0.9576032436983056
Initially a FiO2 of 0.33 (range 0,28-0,38) proved necessary.	1.172874785372616
The initial CPAP level was 7 mbar (range 5-8) with an (Assisted Spontaneous Breathing) ASB of 15 mbar (range 13-18).	1.2345916963826535
FiO2 and CPAP/ASB levels were subsequently gradually reduced until no longer necessary.	0.7632942379409161
In all patients intubation and ventilation was avoided by this regimen.	1.0331682004008786
The treatment was well accepted by all patients and common ventilation associated complications such as pneumonia did not occur.	0.9284836773209154
In comparison with the former standard method of treatment the average ICU stay was dramatically reduced, principally due to not having to gradually wean patients from ventilation and sedation.	1.0145180798262357
Other positive benefits include normal communication and feeding with active early mobilisation leading to faster recovery, both physical and psychological.	0.9492378094697961
We conclude that non-invasive respiratory techniques should be used more frequently and recommend further studies are undertaken to define the indications.	1.093975415121668
Abstract:  Clinical findings and the correct assessment of the morphology and degree of stenosis is a decidant point in the conservative and operative therapy of carotid stenosis.	1.1306622229013081
Diagnosis should be reached fast, sure and cost-effective with a high sensitivity and specifity.	1.0504186478088038
Current methods for articular cartilage repair are unpredictable with respect to clinical success.	0.8953005956486207
In the present study, we investigated the ability of cells from articular cartilage, perichondrium, and costochondral resting zone to form new cartilage when loaded onto biodegradable scaffolds and implanted into calf muscle pouches of nu/nu mice.	0.9876765166453121
Prior in vitro studies showed that platelet derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), but not transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-1), basic fibroblast growth factor, or bone morphogenetic protein-2 promoted proliferation and extracellular matrix sulfation of resting zone chondrocytes without causing the cells to exhibit a hypertrophic chondrocyte phenotype.	1.1596683511172625
TGF-1 has also been shown to stimulate chondrogenesis by multipotent chondroprogenitor cells like those in the perichondrium.	0.9314102790252093
In addition, PDGF-BB has been shown to modulate chondrogensis by resting zone cells implanted in poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) scaffolds.	1.1056238112249772
In the present study we examined whether the cartilage formation is dependent on state of chondrocyte maturation and whether the pretreatment of chondrocytes with growth factors has an influence on the cartilage formation.	1.1121689144084395
Scaffolds were manufactured from 80 % PLG with a 75:25 lactide:glycolide ratio and 20 % modified PLG with a 50:50 lactide:glycolide ratio (PLG-H scaffolds).	1.0898497416527313
For each experimental group, four nude mice received two identical implants, one in each calf muscle resulting in an N = 8 implants: PLG-H scaffolds alone; PLG-H scaffolds with cells derived from either the femoral articular cartilage, costochondral periochondrium, or costochondral resting zone cartilage of 125 g male Sprague-Dawley rats; PLG-H scaffolds with either articular chondrocytes or resting zone chondrocytes that were pretreated with 37,5 ng/ml rhPDGF-BB for 4 h or 24 h before implantation, or with perichondrial cells treated with PDGF-BB plus 0,22 ng/ml rhTGF-1 for 4 h and 24 h. At 4 or 8 weeks after implantation, samples were harvested and analyzed histomorphometrically for new cartilage formed, area of residual implant and area of fibrous connective tissue.	0.9986116835801689
Only resting zone cells showed the ability to form new cartilage at a heterotopic site in this study.	0.958526294253858
There was no neocartilage found in nude mice with implants loaded with either articular chondrocytes or perichondrial cells.	0.766830138430179
Pretreatment of resting zone chondrocytes for 4 h prior to implantation significantly increased the amount of newly formed cartilage after 8 weeks and suppressed chondrocyte hypertrophy.	0.9600259148480739
The amount of fibrous connective tissue around implants containing either articular chondrocytes or perichondrial cells decreased with time, whereas the amount of fibrous connective tissue around implants containing resting zone chondrocytes pretreated with PDGF-BB was increased.	0.7994563442657253
The results showed that resting zone cells can be successfully incorporated into biodegradable porous PLG scaffolds and can induce new cartilage formation in a non-weight-bearing site.	0.9262986207264644
Articular chondrocytes as well as perichondrial cells did not have the capacity for neochondrogenesis when implanted heterotopically in this model.	0.9043685323410218
Bone tumors represent a group of tumors of various dignity.	0.8317245741408908
In spite of this single tumor entities may display strong morphological resemblance to each other which can in turn result in profound difficulties in differential diagnosis.	0.8704600486074612
The biological behaviour of a tumor is mainly determined by its rate of proliferation.	1.086357677370434
In this study the rate of proliferation of 64 bone tumors (30 high-grade central osteosarcomas, 6 low-grade osteosarcomas, 8 giant cell tumors, 8 aneurysmatic bone cysts, 5 osteoidosteomas/osteoblastomas, 7 fibrous dysplasias and 5 cases of a myositis ossificans) were analysed.	1.3133298470014099
Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue sections using the MIB-1 monoclonal antibody.	1.0088296858183985
MIB-1 recognizes the proliferation-associated Ki-67 protein which is expressed during the active phases of the cell cycle but cannot be detected in senescent cells.	0.9771023894270784
Among high-grade central osteosarcomas a significantly higher rate of proliferation (average value 30 %) was found in comparison with low-grade osteosarcomas and other benign intraosseous bone tumors.	1.3258468635326637
This approach proved to be very useful in the distinction between high-grade and low-grade osteosarcomas as well as bone-forming intraosseous tumors.	1.2283138625816812
However distinguishing low-grade osteosarcomas from benign bone tumors by determining only the rate of proliferation was not possible, although interestingly, the proliferative rate of myositis ossificans, a purely reactive lesion, was in the range of the values determined for high-grade osteosarcoma.	1.2698360831165938
Over the past century numerous graft materials have been used for the reconstruction of the cruciate ligament of the knee.	0.9818618371183317
Among the autologous tissues that are currently recommended as graft materials, the central bone patellar tendon bone graft, a quadrupled hamstring graft and the central quadriceps tendon graft have the greatest clinical significance.	1.032726782132002
With some limitations, allograft materials can also be used.	0.7804957180514855
Each of the three mentioned grafts has specific features regarding morphological and structural properties, graft fixation and graft incorporation.	0.9454637457884086
Clinical studies have failed to identify any of the three grafts as superior to the others.	1.0191482353983476
When choosing the graft for surgery the different anatomy and function of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments have to be considered.	0.9625359001059364
For the treatment of multiple ligament injuries and for revision cases, thorough preoperative planning is necessary and modified graft selection may be required.	1.066693729779875
Myasthenic crisis is a lifethreatening complication of myasthenia gravis due to respiratory failure and inability to swallow and cough up secretions.	0.8555119261083127
Frequent causes are intercurrent infections, fluctuations due to the natural history of the disease and insufficient immunosuppressive treatment prior to the crisis.	1.0444134321093685
Early referral to an experienced neurologist is essential.	0.6701542896565084
Specific therapy consists of symptomatic treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors, crisis management with plasmapheresis or immunoglobulins and immunosuppression with clucocorticoids.	0.8031911615573794
Infections must be treated vigorously.	0.5927506719035168
Thymectomy in patients with previously unrecognized myasthenia gravis is never urgently indicated and should be postponed until the patient is stabilized.	0.9668290415855565
In cases of impending respiratory failure and severe swallowing difficulties, early and elective admission to a specialized neurological intensive care unit and elective intubation should be performed.	1.056704988798663
Adequate nursing care of intubated patients and a set of prophylactic measures are essential to avoid complications adversely affecting prognosis.	0.930911918869109
Whenever it can be achieved, the best therapy of myasthenic crisis is its prevention by appropriate long-term management and follow-up of patients with myasthenia gravis.	1.3025827683838869
In a retrospective analysis we evaluated 48 patients who had been arthroscopically treated for tendinitis calcarea.	1.0483646766959958
The calcific deposit was removed whenever possible and all patients were treated by arthroscopic subacromial decompression.	1.123609499716304
In subjects who showed subacromial stenosis by X-ray or by intraoperative findings, an arthroscopic acromioplasty was performed.	1.007897165942957
At follow-up all patients were evaluated according to the Constant score.	1.0450344340250086
Additionally all pre- and postoperative X-rays were reviewed.	1.0916392102623331
After surgery the Constant score significantly improved.	0.8017849920676657
In all cases where acromioplasty was performed, a flattening of the bony configuration was achieved.	1.0482186962406945
The X-ray analysis showed that no calcific deposit with blurred borders converted to sharp borders.	0.7960034522493787
There was also no deposit that converted from a transparent appearance to a dense structure.	0.8855208283407279
Patients with disappearance of the calcific deposit postoperatively had significantly better outcome than patients with no change in the X-ray.	0.8162165221506975
An additional acromioplasty did not improve the results.	0.5616334483802509
The aim of arthroscopic treatment of calcific tendinitis has to be the removal of the calcific deposit.	1.3413179922325815
Acromioplasty does not lead to further improvement of the result.	0.9457643957610273
Preventive strategies aim to reduce gastric acidity (H2ms (sucralfate, antacids, pirenzepine) and to normalize gastric mucosal microcirculation (sucralfate, pirenzepine).	0.9468136256130418
Thus, the most important prophylactic measure is an optimized emergency and ICU regime aiming to improve oxygenation and microcirculation.	1.1066893701494778
All specific drugs used for stress ulcer prophylaxis have been shown to be effective in prospective controlled studies.	0.8920925948866234
Furthermore, pirenzepine has been found to be superior to H2-antagonists, at least in neurosurgical patients.	1.0945996618196887
Insufficient or no data exist to support the use of prostaglandins or omeprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis.	0.8010454129750164
The most important adverse effect of stress ulcer prophylaxis is nosocomial pneumonia due to gastric alkalinization.	0.9136792334413206
This may occur in long-term ventilated patients with a gastric pH>4 and may account for up to 50% of all nosocomial pneumonias in certain groups of patients.	1.119888592780314
Mortality is not influenced by antacids or H2-antagonists, while sucralfate has been shown to reduce mortality, most probably by inhibition of bacterial translocation.	1.0365331688309707
Three years after heart transplantation and immunosuppressive therapy, a 66-year-old man suffered from dyspnea and showed symptoms mainly due to right heart failure.	0.8876025114577746
Malignant tumor cells were discovered within extensive pleural effusion.	0.8461489144393413
Computed tomography revealed two lesions of the liver suspicious of metastases, and recurrent blood in the stools was evident.	1.074633044105638
The patient deteriorated rapidly and died 3 weeks after admission.	0.7741805807293695
Autopsy findings included an adenocarcinoma of the cecum (grade II) with metastases to the liver.	1.252328364737402
High-grade immunoblastic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of plasmoblastic differentiation was diagnosed, located within the mediastinal soft tissue and infiltrating the peri- and myocardium.	0.9402860191959244
Mesenteric lymph nodes were enlarged with histological verification of malignant lymphoma.	0.812664691383953
The lymphatic tumor masses had caused considerable compression of the heart and vessels, leading to the signs of cardiac failure.	0.9935127277933951
The development of metastasizing colonic carcinoma and high-grade immunoblastic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 3 years after heart transplantation and immunosuppressive therapy must be considered an unusual combination.	0.9676365490381875
Malignant lymphomas following heart transplantation have been described several times.	0.919859148328462
Infection rates are important markers for clinical quality assurance.	0.7853595756668141
For internal control, they may only be used under the condition of homogeneous data collection and evaluation according to identical standard operating procedures during the entire investigation period.	0.9571005183095692
For inter-hospital comparison, they may only be used if additionally the observed patient groups are well defined and comparable.	0.9756134392976318
A survey of the infection rates published during the last 6 years in the German traumatological literature (n = 71) indeed shows (concerning series later than 1985) similar infection rates for procedures in less and in more problematic anatomical regions and in clean and contaminated situations of about 2 - 3%, after open injuries sporadically max.	1.250330415143551
Finally, it is demonstrated that conclusions concerning a general "risk of infection" based on infection rates for specific surgical procedures are not possible and vice versa.	1.3143391839786331
We strongly recommend the future application of a standardized definition of wound infection.	0.9155626274521748
The differentiation between deep and superficial infection should be abandoned.	0.8181926220351965
For all mentioned "infection rates" it should be indicated whether it is with reference to the risk of infection of a specific procedure or only a general statement.	1.0775614423595776
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) are useful techniques for the objective documentation of the relation between the femoral head and the acetabulum after closed or open reduction of a developmental dislocation of the hip joint.	1.068493189369237
Before the ossification nucleus of the femoral head is sufficiently developed, MRI is preferred.	1.0529141877712933
For the evaluation of reduction from the 2nd year on, MRI and CT are equivalent.	1.080412019530404
However, in older children MRI may also be indicated for the evaluation of cartilaginous structures or the diagnosis of femoral head necrosis.	1.2642309992385794
CT in older patients may also be useful for 30 analysis of bony structures, e. g. for planning complex osteotomies.	0.9944210208225293
Careful diagnostic and early therapy are especially important in cases of scaphoid fractures.	0.9455444478969952
This is due to the patients being mostly young and the high number of non-unions of these carpal bones.	0.9793907769745206
Conservative and various operative treatments are therapeutical options.	0.7197888615984825
Out of the patients who underwent surgery from January 1993 to February 1999 42 patients with a scaphoid fracture and 88 patients with a scaphoid non-union were, in addition to standard X-ray examination, examined clinically and by MRI pre- and post-operatively.	1.2496491898930822
Fractures of the scaphoid were treated by Herbert screw fixtion.	1.01712115461388
When there is a possibility that tissue samples have been interchanged, DNA analysis of the histological specimens can be carried out to correctly assign the specimens to a patient.	1.0666577277034195
The use of polymerase chain reaction enables results to be obtained even from degraded DNA in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples.	0.7544488171816911
A review of 110 children with Burkitt's lymphoma admitted to the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu during a 7-year period revealed a preponderance of males over females (1.9 : 1) and a peak incidence at five years.	1.1761130603127348
The main sites affected initially by the tumour in order of frequency were the face and abdomen.	0.9786766913803623
The spinal column, spleen, and lungs were less affected.	1.078333806757764
It is postulated that an interaction between malarial and Epstein-Barr virus infections and malnutrition are important in the aetiology of the tumour.	0.9795912149090504
The most effective drug is cyclophosphamide.	0.9721136104001519
A combination of this drug with vincristine and methotrexate is equally effective in inducing remissions, but is better than the single agent in preventing systemic relapse.	1.1182438826847891
Follow-up of the patients revealed good survival.	1.5121040030982293
The consumption of the jet set drug Ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymetamphetamine, abbreviated to MDMA) by young people is increasing markedly.	1.131501652434581
Parallel to this developement, there is a large number of reports on severe neurological, psychiatric and medical complications following the use of Ecstasy.	1.0502260552343656
Seizures are among the most common clinical complications of the CNS following the ingestion of Ecstasy.	1.0428792092839136
The term "mild cognitive impairment" refers to cognitive deficits which exceed normal physiological aging processes, but do not fulfill the criteria for dementia.	0.9422221918937488
The prevalence rates of four current concepts were compared in a sample of 202 healthy 60-64 year-old participants recruited from the interdisciplinary longitudinal study on adult development and aging (ILSE).	1.0140401477668515
Furthermore, the relationships between cognitive deficits and psychological and sociodemographic variables were examined.	0.97387776571102
The following prevalence rates were determined: 13.5% for age-associated memory impairment, 6.5% for age-consistent memory impairment, 1.5% for late-life forgetfulness and 23.5% for aging-associated cognitive decline.	1.2571161667445667
Subjective cognitive complaints did not correlate with results obtained from neuropsychological tests.	0.9239032323132199
Significant correlations were however found between subjective cognitive complaints and higher scores on depression and neuroticism scales.	0.9268978462856595
Significant correlations were also found between a reduced test performance and a lower educational level and socioeconomic status.	1.067859578812265
Longitudinal studies are warranted to further elucidate the predictive value of these diagnostic concepts.	0.8655797254897151
In a retrospective study, we evaluated 180 patients treated for painful spondylolisthesis with combined anterior and posterior fusion.	1.1631660476078192
Group I included 90 patients treated by anterior fusion with the transperitoneal approach.	0.8830819428886684
Group II included 90 patients operated on with a retroperitoneal approach.	0.8094605627001957
Group II showed a higher incidence of pseudarthrosis L5/S1 (4 %), tear of the common iliac vein (1 %), postsympathectomy syndrome (4 %) and reversible L4 nerve-root lesion (3 %).	1.2033610996646953
On the basis of our findings, we recommend the transperitoneal approach for anterior interbody fusion L5 to S1 or L4 to S1.	0.97789456015362
Coronary surgery is at this point of time the standard therapy of unprotected left main coronary artery stenosis.	1.1679325329840926
Coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is performed only in bail out situations.	0.8304520720299245
The number of publications of successful percutaneous intervention in unprotected left main coronary stenosis is increasing because of increasing use of stents and ticlopidine to avoid stent-thrombosis.	0.9544204963206993
Within the context of an extensive study of electroconvulsive therapy at the Psychiatric Clinic of the University of Bonn 15 patients suffering from therapy-resistent Major depression (DSM III-R) were examined with a detailed psychometric test battery, containing memory- and nonmemory tests.	1.1265678826789083
The test battery had been applied short time before, during and after the treatment with 10 ECT applied unilateral over the nondominant hemisphere.	1.040627487841348
Comparing the test performances before and 1-2 days after the end of the series there were only few remarkable changes: a significant decrease was diagnosed exclusively in 30 min delayed recall of verbal items, while visual short-term memory and visual-constructive performance showed a significant improvement (in spite of unilateral stimulation on the right side).	1.2732549999033074
None of the other cognitive functions inclusively speed of performances and reaction time was detracted short time after the end of the ECT-treatment, instead all the measures improved albeit not significantly.	1.0054056372032385
Between responders to treatment (50% improvement in HAMD) and non-responders no significant differences neither before nor after the treatment were detected.	1.1144798048406797
The non-responders had in nearly all of the tests some better (but not significantly) results despite being older than the group of responders.	1.0764765226307285
In this study we assessed the drawing abilities in 37 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria.	0.9736933375268351
Drawing abilities (drawing: house, flower, clock; Rey-Osterrieth figure; copying: MMST-figure; Rey-Osterrieth figure) were quantified with different rating schemes and related to other neuropsychological assessments.	0.8420835595961522
All patients underwent a positron emission tomography with 18-FDG.	1.1053845979812782
Drawing performance was highly correlated with severity of dementia - expressed in MMST scores (r=0.78; p<0.0001) - with visuo-spatial short-term memory (r=-0.69; p=0.001), and writing abilities (r=-0.77; p<0.0001).	1.0422002921954359
The summarized drawing score showed a statistically significant correlation with the rate of temporoparietal glucose metabolism measured with positron emission tomography and 18-FDG (r=0.39; p=0.017).	1.0062451839768176
In the drawings of AD patients omittings and simplifications were typical, whereas perseverations rarely occured.	0.922019476323857
In severely demented patients closing-in phenomenons could be de- scribed, too.	0.7386184286264985
A subgroup of AD patients with visuo-constructive impairment as the leading symptom could not be identified.	0.9273628132189978
Since the first dermatological outpatient clinic was started in Dresden in 1869, it has seen the practice of dermatology in the broadest sense, with scientific research activity and innovation.	1.1541123534242455
The good working relationship between the dermatologists in private practice and those in the clinics has been the main factor in this successful development.	1.0238317162658588
The traditional background of the following sectors is highlighted: outpatient clinic, X-ray and UV ligth treatment, allergology and occupational dermatology, psychosomatic dermatology, dermatosurgery, and phlebology.	1.01515162621216
A 12-year-old girl from Zaire with Aids (CDC: P2 D1) presented with a generalized molluscum contagiosum infection.	1.0057775307803012
She had suffered from systemic cryptococcosis and from cryptosporidiosis several months before admission.	0.697551329700859
While molluscum contagiosum infection is usually a self-limiting disease in immunocompetent persons, a fulminant appearance and persistence of giant mollusca occurs with advanced immunodeficiency.	0.9703876593920913
Histological and immunohistological examinations showed a severe diminution of Langerhans and T cell populations that might enhance the dissemination of the infection.	0.8711439097971272
Molluscum-like lesions of cryptococci have been described, and cutaneous cryptococcosis is the main condition to be considered in the differential diagnosis.	1.0744061701994236
Further differential diagnoses should include American and African histoplasmosis, and the cutaneous manifestations of mycobacterial infections, of toxoplasmosis and of Pneumocystis carinii infection.	1.0827323805950113
The search for vascular structures in skin tumors by incident light microscopy has revealed a surprisingly high proportion of vascularized tumours.	0.8201173434292802
Characteristic vascular patterns, in some cases highly tumour-specific, have been defined.	1.0728036013856803
The vascular structure is a valuable feature for characterization and differentiation of skin tumours, especially for amelanotic malignant melanoma.	1.1266426355591628
We propose a flowchart procedure for analysis and diagnosis of skin tumours using incident light microscopy, which appears to be valuable for advanced image analytic techniques.	0.9728702675062936
Introduction: The treatment of full-thickness cartilage defects still represents a problem that has not yet been solved satisfactorily.	1.1073059695179557
Current methods used to cover defects in the knee joint are osteochondral cylinder transplantation (OCT) and autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT).	0.9747149202299825
Methods: With a prospective clinical investigation, at the time being with 2-year results, we have examined ACT in comparison to OCT in 20 patients with regard to clinical and histomorphological (histology, immunohistochemistry, RES) outcome.	1.3954872392703424
Results: We found equally good results with both methods in Lysholm, Meyers and Tegner Activity Scores.	1.1326412586056394
Histomorphologic evaluation of biopsies obtained by arthroscopy after ACT showed a defect filling in all cases, mainly with fibrous cartilage, while localized areas of hyalinelike regenerative cartilage were documented near the base.We did not see any histomorphologically visible change in the transplants after OCT.	0.9690319542759203
Conclusion: At the time we prefer OCT instead of ACT given the correct indication.	1.1668244469597693
This case report intends to focus attention on hemodynamic TIAs as cause of repetitive involuntary movements (RIMs) as differential diagnosis of simple partial motor seizures.	1.0523794602204424
We report two patients with episodic unilateral limb shaking lasting up to several minutes and which could be triggered by orthostasis, heat or physical exertion.	0.945530762202586
Repeated EEG recordings revealed no epileptic discharges.	0.6326153861935443
In both patients, duplex ultrasonography revealed an occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) contralateral to the side of the RIMs.	0.8538236010387458
Blood flow velocities in the middle cerebral artery ipsilateral to ICA occlusion were reduced and vasomotor reactivity to hypercapnia was absent.	0.8645071228906885
After elevation of blood pressure both patients became asymptomatic.	0.9811283950790518
We suggest that in patients with episodes of RIMs, Doppler sonography and tests of cerebral vascular reserve capacity should be performed to search for a hemodynamic origin of these symptoms.	1.0712803025875564
Ethylene dichloride (EDC) is used as a solvent and in the rubber, plastic, and insecticide industry.	1.1177632377953535
The fatal adult dose is below 20 ml.	0.6453314643983045
Poisoning can occur from inhalation, ingestion or skin absorption.	0.7917720285315627
EDC depresses almost all cells, but essentially those of the central nervous system, liver, kidneys, and heart.	1.0428945327624715
Death is usually due to liver or central nervous failure.	0.8258120323384742
Retrospectively analyzing the history of three patients with gastrointesinal stromal tumors (GIST) treated over a period of 1 year in the surgical department of our regional hospital, we tried to answer the following questions: using the current recommendations in the literature, how are the macro- and microscopic features and clinical presentation to be interpreted?	1.1511747517974829
Which prognostic and therapeutic conclusions should we draw, giving special consideration to practice-orientated management of such cases.	0.9999993846346278
The patients were 65, 75 and 88 years old respectively, and in each case the GIST manifested as recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding.	1.298987394841652
During surgical treatment four gastric tumors ranging in cross section between 2.5 and 8 cm were found.	1.029441152969063
The GIST diagnosis was established after light microscopic and immunohistochemical examinations.	0.8258558118018703
Going through the current literature, a large number of structural and immunohistochemical criteria have come to light for determining its classification and potential malignancy.	1.0170135042125783
On the other hand, very few subsequent recommendations concerning therapy and prognosis can be found and follow-up recomendations are almost unavailable.	1.0456997230848328
We conclude that GISTs are difficult to diagnose because of their locality and that their clinical behavior is uncertain.	1.0587960222607355
The potential malignancy, on the other hand, requires a well-founded diagnostic procedure in the form of the best possible pre-therapeutic staging.	1.038362212031262
Furthermore, initially radical surgical treatment should be adopted and the follow-up should be adapted to the risk involved.	1.2035919266987387
The latter is arbitrary and further clinical studies are required.	0.9219766457267717
In animal experiments and clinical studies liquid ventilation with perfluorcarbons improves gas exchange and breathing mechanics in damaged lungs.	0.9893017178665916
According to the data on the toxicity of perfluorcarbons available today, it could potentially be applied in infants in the future, too.	1.2858660482218924
However, the catalogue of unanswered questions is still too long for controlled clinical phase III studies to be conducted.	0.9542068213036417
Further possible applications of liquid ventilation offer hope of solving open therapeutic and diagnostic problems.	0.8437784884075166
Taking into account all available data about liquid ventilation with perfluorcarbons today, we still do not know whether it is a real alternative method for respiratory support; however, further studies to investigate whether the method is an alternative strategy for artificial ventilation in neonates are justified.	1.2695797487766511
The role of elective lymph node dissection (ELND) in primary malignant melanoma is controversial.	0.9303610495998506
Our purpose was to evaluate the benefit of ELND regarding survival and disease-free survival in malignant melanoma of the trunk and extremities.	0.9905755448461249
By matched-pair analysis, 375 patients treated by wide local excision (WLE) plus ELND were compared to 375 patients treated by WLE only.	0.9915104659619647
There was no difference in survival between the two treatment groups; however, the disease-free interval was significantly higher in the collective treated by WLE plus ELND (P<0.05).	1.0438140875137771
Increased survival rates were noted for intermediate tumor thickness of 1.51-4.0 mm for the WLE+ELND group although the difference was not significant (P=0.14), and disease-free survival was significantly improved in this group (P<0.001).	1.184407353106567
ELND elicited a higher benefit in male patients with intermediate thickness melanoma.	0.8196544673634736
Our results confirm the findings of several studies that ELND improves the outcome after primary treament of malignant melanoma of intermediate tumor thickness.	1.021799206701793
7 patients (5 female, 2 male; age:  22-81 years; average age=58,1 J) with recurrent necrotizing ANCA-negative, non leucocytoclastic vasculitis, were enrolled into this study.	1.2314376179829862
Disease was resistant to prior conservative therapy, and therefore patients received high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) - (dose: 1,0 g/kg body weight daily dose 0,25 g/kg body weight over 4 consecutive days).	1.1479544962348294
All patients responded rapidly to this therapeutic regimen.	0.7334174619361138
Specifically immediate pain relief was striking.	0.6886572253888922
Complete clearance of disease was observed in 5 out of 7 patients within 6 months while receiving IVIG (0,5 g/kg body weight) every 4 weeks for one year.	1.1683793442687174
In 2 out of 5 patients ulceration and vasculitis healed completly and therapy could be stopped after 6 months.	0.8651346755579332
In one patient treatment had to be discontinued due to decreasing kidney function.	0.9393518213841803
The data presented demonstrate that IVIG is an  effective and valuable therapeutic modality in treatment of severe vasculitis resistant to conventional therapy.	0.9825406580569885
However consideration of costs, effectiveness and possible side effects is needed for this therapeutic regime.	1.0207028672646947
After orthopedic surgery, skeletal muscle will enter the rehabilitation process in weakened condition due to the following characteristics.	0.9779930854681647
After use of a tourniquet during surgery, the muscle suffers ischemia/reperfusion damage due to oxidative stress, resulting in structural impairment.	1.0403498843537815
The resulting immobilization leads to muscular atrophy, with a loss of calcium homeostasis and oxidative stress being of etiological significance.	0.9470420766059264
Degeneration of muscle fibers as well as regeneration occurs in muscle while still immobilized.	0.8417672118903634
After remobilization, the muscle has impaired functional capacity and frequently shows disturbances in its innervation pattern.	0.9986492997885589
High mechanical loading should therefore be avoided, and electrical stimulation may be applied to facilitate recovery.	1.0241764764539507
Considering the role of oxygen radicals, supplementation with vitamin E appears generally recommendable.	0.7591242821571418
The timing of surgery and postoperative radiotherapy - especially if combined with chemotherapy - has been a subject of interest over the past years.	1.4230700500035494
This analysis was based on a literature review of mostly retrospective publications.	0.9801566621727281
Data concerning the interval between surgery and radiotherapy were correlated with the locoregional control, incidence of distant metastases and prognosis of breast cancer, lung carcinoma, and head and neck carcinomas.	1.039679976094664
The reviewed data did not show a clear relationship of the time interval between surgery and start of radiotherapy and locoregional control.	0.9881255896581438
However, evaluation of the data was difficult, because in most publications, retrospective analyses were performed and other prognostically more relevant parameters may influence locoregional control stronger than the time interval.	1.2571367842737102
In patients with head and neck carcinomas, there is a negative effect of time interval between surgery and radiotherapy on local control if unfavorable factors exist, i. e., close surgical margins, unfavorable pathohistological parameters and low radiation dose.	1.0359738490482813
In patients with breast cancer who do not receive chemotherapy, there are inconsistent reports in the literature.	0.954305632578525
If additional chemotherapy is necessary, the sequence surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy seems adequate.	1.0042415411600496
Although some data suggest that delaying the initiation of radiotherapy due to chemotherapy may increase the risk or local recurrences, there may, on the other hand, be an increased likelihood of systemic metastases, if radiotherapy is applied before chemotherapy.	1.1387972574260723
Concerning lung cancer, only one retrospective analysis exists suggesting a better survival of patients with an interval of more than 36 days between surgery and radiotherapy as compared to patients with a shorter interval.	1.2354908892546652
The treatment of severely injured patients is a challenge for preclinical and clinical treatment concepts, causing financial aspects of increasing importance for the German health care system.	1.0713808424191178
A total of 32,500 polytraumatized patients (PTS III and IV) are managed in trauma center levels I-IV in Germany.	1.2173926320336437
Trauma center levels I or II are by definition capable of supporting the full range of treatment for the severely injured.	0.8663330498927663
With the baseline calculation of 64,000 DM per patient and 104 polytrauma treated per year in the Berlin Virchow Clinic, 6.66 million DM primary costs must be spent for treatment.	0.9729619501105978
The total annual costs of this center are nearly 24 million DM for emergency cases and 7 million DM fixed costs per year, for a trauma center level I.	0.9865078001581946
In Europe the distribution of trauma center levels I or II is sufficient and can be specified with 1 center per 1 million inhabitants.	0.864513764111637
Nevertheless, the european air medical service could support more intensive use of these central trauma institutions.	1.0307799746565474
This was shown by comparing the number of polytrauma patients and the number of trauma centers.	0.9582368072904623
Less then half of these patients are treated in levels I or II trauma centers.	1.1046071964232143
The financial pressure on the health system and the rising quality must lead to better utilization of trauma centers.	0.9053253972684354
To meet this goal a annual treatment rate of 300-400 polytrauma patients should be aimed at.	0.7718930108899209
The claim of the American College of Surgeons that a trauma surgeon should treat 50 severely injured patients per year would then be possible.	0.9529931656802794
This report is a retrospective investigation of the efficacy of bioenergetic therapies given to adults in a private practice setting and furthermore a study of the stability of the therapeutic results achieved.	1.0934759818983508
In the spring of 1997 a total of 16 bioenergetic therapists (6 of them medical doctors and 10 psychologists), all members of the Swiss Society of Bioenergetic Therapists (SGBAT), provided upon request a number of data on 319 patients who had terminated their therapies after a minimum of 20 sessions 6 months to 6 years earlier.	1.2064709511258502
A self-evaluating questionnaire was then constructed, to be answered anonymously, and was sent to these 319 patients in late summer 1997; 290 of them could be reached and 142 (49%) returned it.	1.1571438379228836
The questionnaire contained questions related to the psychic and physical condition, to interpersonal and psychosomatic problems, and to the effect of body work on physical consciousness, cognitive insights and changes of the quality of life.	1.211727774078564
Regarding the efficacy of bioenergetic therapies, the statistical analysis of the returned questionnaires showed significant positive changes in all areas questioned.	0.9593909644634707
Bioenergetic body work was judged to be important and indispensable by about half of the patients.	0.9770638584851902
Regarding the stability of the therapeutic result, 107 patients indicated a stable or even improved condition.	0.9233774605178086
Of the 35 patients who since termination of the bioenergetic therapy had chosen to undergo further therapy, 16 opted again for a body-oriented psychotherapy.	0.9694990422122785
Purpose: In a clinical study 35 patients with intracranial aneurysms were examined using CT-angiography, MR-angiography (MRA) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA).	1.2520003058474407
The aim of the study was to establish the ability of noninvasive techniques to detect intracranial aneurysms.	1.126867504053022
"Classic" choroidal neovascularization (CNV) has a relatively uniform appearance in fluorescein angiography.	1.0264663300539438
In contrast, indocyanine green (ICG) angiography shows variable features of well-defined CNV.	0.9935219335791642
We examined 31 classic CNV patients secondary to age-related macular degeneration using a confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscope (Heidelberg Retina Angiograph) in order to determine ICG characteristics of classic CNV.	0.9096600999102902
Vascular patterns (97%), a hypofluorescent rim (84%), a hyperfluorescent margin (42%), late ICG leakage (32%) and "feeder vessels" were identified in variable frequency.	1.2081155455445316
Some of the ICG characteristics may correlate with histological features of the membrane and reflect proliferative activity.	0.8926815184003216
Extrafoveal "feeder vessels" may be amenable to laser photocoagulation in the presence of subfoveal CNV.	0.8730096781339055
In situ polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR in situ hybridization are new diagnostic tools in dermatopathology.	0.8435808616175682
These techniques can combine the sensitivity of PCR with the advantage of in situ hybridization to localize specific cellular structures.	0.99271296883834
With optical control of the PCR reaction product in these techniques, false-positive results due to contamination can be minimized.	1.036225655980675
Several working protocols have been established which allow detection of DNA and RNA sequences in a rapid and reproducible manner.	0.9480265317793197
Two different methods have been established to detect the amplification product, the indirect PCR in situ hybridization (PCRisHyb), and the direct in situ PCR (is PCR).	1.2015060939172375
An easy and reproducible method for PCRisHyb and isPCR in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue is described and the two techniques are compared.	0.8430557391208888
Using both isPCR and PCRisHyb, the amplification product can be visualized with an optimal morphological preservation of the tissue.	0.963857717400462
Indirect PCRisHyb showed a slightly higher specificity whereas direct isPCR was the quicker, easier and less expensive method.	0.7904688020886494
In a randomized study 30 patients with chronic stationary psoriasis were treated with 3 different topical schemes.	1.1602129642634216
Group 1 (n=10) received monotherapy (dithranol (D) twice a day, D/D), group 2 (n=10) calcipotriol mornings/dithranol evenings (calcipotriol (C)/dithranol (D) C/D) and 3 (mometasone (M) mornings/dithranol (D) evenings, M/D).	1.0038051698170454
During the therapy period of 4 weeks we documented the PASI-Score as well as infiltration, erythema and desquamation weekly.	0.9806632092724225
The M/D group revealed in the first week a significantly faster reduction of the PASI-score (5,3) than in the D/D group (PASI 13,22).	1.2142469438043686
The C/D group (PASI 10,5) show a not significantly faster reduction.	0.9467521852298943
After 4 weeks of treatment and after a follow period of 6 weeks there were similar PASI-Scores in all groups.	1.1830274729661128
There were less side-effects in the M/D group than in the others.	1.1090163890779776
The beginning, more anti-psoriatic effectiveness was achieved by the mometasone/dithranol combination than the other schemes.	0.9744905231447131
In the long term, the effects were similar.	1.1966065230522906
This report describes a distinctive pattern of findings in peripheral sensory-nociceptive afferent nerves after spinal injury.	0.8534496611978112
Subsequent to trauma there was segmental, multisegmental or hemilateral hypoaesthesia with refractory, intenseful painful symptoms.	0.7484354879387742
None of the classical neurological causes for such hypoaesthesia were present.	0.9651030842915084
"Normal" therapy resulted in more severe symptoms.	0.8519323396277763
Depending on the distribution of the hypo- or anaesthesia, there were also efferent symptoms (coordination problems, impairments of proprioception, etc.).	1.0387534418660538
Colleagues who have made similar observations or are familiar with these symptoms are cordially invited to assist with the interpretation of this clinical picture.	0.938589670578828
The pharynx, being part of the digestive as well as the respiratory system, is embedded in the complex spatial anatomy of the neck and, due to its function and location, represents a very sophisticated region.	1.1896514927463828
Cisatracurium (51W89, Nimbex, Glaxo-Wellcome), an intermediate-acting non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent, is a stereoisomer of atracurium.	1.0599762359648428
Histamine releasing propensities and serum tryptase level have been investigated after administration of cisatracurium (3xED95, 5xED95) or vecuronium (3xED90) in surgical patients.	1.017307661535317
Methods: After approval by our institutional review board, 62 patients (ASA I-II) were randomly assigned to three groups to receive either 3xED95 or 5xED95 cisatracurium, or 3xED90 vecuronium as a rapid bolus.	0.9595208082581038
A prick test was done the day before by scarification of the skin in the forearm.	1.0383556136770813
After premedication with 2 mg lormetazepam, anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone (4-12 mg/kg) and maintained with O2/N2O and isoflurane (1.5-2 vol.%).	0.9019776093210389
Six minutes after thiopentone, the patients received the relaxant, and after further 6 min 0.1-0.2 mg fentanyl was given and the trachea was intubated.	1.2219113010531903
Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were monitored every minute.	0.7578047312481697
Blood samples for histamine were withdrawn 5 min prior 3 and 5 min after each drug administration (thiopentone, relaxants).	0.9317586879378488
Plasma histamine was measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) with a sensitivity of approximately 10 pg/ml.	1.0479471752667866
Additionally, serum tryptase was measured by RIA at baseline (-10 and  -1 min) and 15 and 60 min after the relaxant administration.	1.6048368287502612
Levels for histamine >1000 pg/ml and for tryptase >2 µg/ml were considered significant.	1.0765198490013697
Cutaneous signs of histamine release were documented.	0.4833540781190302
Results: Ten patients showed a positive prick-test reaction.	1.124072097305855
Only after thiopentone some cutaneous signs (4 flush, 1 erythema) of histamine release were observed.	1.2463084060463534
There were no cutaneous signs of histamine release correlating with cardiovascular changes.	0.9222904410248274
Analysis of the blood samples demonstrated no significant increase in the histamine level in all three groups.	1.2595514895792745
Only in 1 patient was a significant higher histamine level (1133 pg/ml) measured 5 min after 5xED95 cisatracurium.	1.0619975761286937
All measurements of serum tryptase were within the physiological limits.	0.9103889546088065
Discussion: In this study, with the particular time course of drug administration, neither cisatracurium nor vecuronium increased plasma histamine levels.	1.1965637143156354
Only after 5xED95 cisatracurium was 1 elevated histamine level documented after 5 min.	0.7470907375336958
In several studies increased histamine levels have been described, but without clinical manifestations.	1.188213469025759
It is known that cutaneous signs can occur without increased plasma histamine levels due to the structural heterogeneity of mast cells.	0.9491944263554161
The cutaneous reactions in this study were caused by thiopentone.	1.1481369351812196
The tryptase values were within normal limits even in the patient with histamine release.	1.1131554995308848
No relationship between the positive results in the prick test and the incidence of cutaneous reactions and/or histamine release for drugs used in the induction of anaesthesia was observed.	1.097607269735272
Whether cisatracurium has a potential for immunologic release is unknown.	0.8212049255106035
We report on a psychosis caused by application of a transdermal scopolamine patch for over 15 days.	0.9840635289666566
In the literature there is no mention of a case in which scopolamine had such an influence nor are any cases reported in which paranoid-hallucinatory symptoms cortinued 11 days after removing the patch.	1.060897493470675
Bone and joint tuberculosis, as all other types of tuberculosis is generally treated with antituberculotic combination chemotherapy.	0.9774374272893185
This has to be continued for a minimum of six months, or nine months in case of extensive spreading.	1.1141942069713535
A two- to three-month initial phase with four or five different drugs (H, R, Z, and additionally E and/or S) is followed by a four- to six-month therapy with H and R alone, provided the pathogen is fully susceptible to a standard regimen.	1.2064938782296688
The main side effects are hepatotoxic or allergic reactions.	0.8352022191378291
A frequent contra-indication is existing, often toxicity-induced, liver damage.	0.9968668141730984
The main local complications requiring surgery are spinal instability or neurologic deficiencies.	0.7506019700514034
This report concerns the case of a patient who had suffered a massive pulmonary embolus and for whom, despite immediately administered thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA it became necessary to initiate reanimation procedures.	1.0993471708263767
The patient was subsequently admitted to our cardiac surgery clinic for the purpose of operative intervention.	1.2546097414240327
After femorofemoral coupling on the heart-lung machine, right ventricular relieve was rapidly attained.	0.8665921336411466
During the course of a 3-hour period of extracorporal circulation, the initially significantly elevated pulmonary pressures were able to be reduced to moderate levels.	1.1479546166990908
Correspondingly, right ventricular recovery could be echocardiographically determined.	0.8024924120005608
As a consequence of this development, and after preclusion the presence of any large thrombotic masses which might have been situated in the pulmonary trunk, it was possible to forego thoracotomy and embolectomy.	1.1934408546117001
This procedure allowed, on the one hand, the avoidance of imminent right ventricular failure through the use of the heart-lung machine.	1.069678487499923
On the other, due to the lessening of the degree of surgical intervention, the risk of grave hemorrhaging as a result of concurrent thrombolytic therapy could be minimalized.	1.0300081096981821
After an uneventful course, the patient was able to be transferred on the second postoperative day with normal pulmonary pressure values.	1.238126071350368

Septic abortion remains one of the most serious threats to the health and life of women throughout the world.	1.050148896923062
Morbidity and mortality are infrequent in countries where induced abortion is legal and medically well organized, but widespread in many developing countries where it is either illegal or inaccessible.	1.0203766402859216
We observed two patients with stone formation in the renal pelvis two and five years after pyeloplasty.	1.000174629175551
In both cases there was no obstruction of the pyeloureteral junction detectable.	0.9230107196442895
We consider the use of Polyglactin (Vicryl) for the pelvis suture as reason for the stone formation.	1.082458353675164
For stone removal we favourite an endoscopic procedure, in which a removal of residuums of the suture is even possible as the verification of the pyeloureteral junction.	1.0501738508851752
Aim of the study: The aim was to determine the efficiency of a secure control of ventilation in emergency medicine by using capnometry.	1.100351560047953
This question was of special interest for mechanically ventilated patients with cerebral diseases, because here hyperventilation as well as hypoventilation can result in severe consequences.	1.0825008026816538
The advent of the excimer laser has brought about the potential for improved vision in many individuals with myopia and astigmatism.	0.8912859109307334
However, photoastigmatic refractive keratectomy (PARK) remains a matter of controversy.	0.9978025926930435
The purpose of our study was to determine the predictability of VISX 20/20 excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy in the treatment of myopic astigmatism.	0.8219754681316979
In Germany, insect allergies cause about 10-40 death per year.	0.8202696172026918
Starting a specific immunotherapy (SIT) and its maintenance may be lifesaving for the allergic patients.	1.059420289516718
Performing a prospective study, we exactly documented effects and side effects during the induction phase of SIT using a purified aqueous yellow jacket venom preparation in 20 patients allergic to yellow jacket venom (clinical degree II-IV).	0.963433681037541
Indication for the therapy was defined individually for each patient and was based on a score incorporating the following criteria: a) clinical symptoms, b) in-vivo- and in-vitro testing, c) risk of re-sting.	1.3473945841813109
SIT was started under inpatient conditions following a standardized 8 day protocol.	0.8060092763837852
At the end of the induction phase all patients tolerated the maintenance dose of 100 µg of yellow jacket venom without complications even though all showed local side effects (threshold doses 0.01-10 µg, median value 0.2 µg).	1.1084694090465117
40% of all patients showed subjective side effects (median value of threshold dose 30 µg, range 0.2-60 µg) and 30% showed objective side effects (median value of threshold dose 55 µg, range 20-80 µg); however, all side effects were clinically mild.	1.33013742537188
When objective systemic side effects were seen, the cumulative daily dose was 39-210 µg (median value 135 µg), exceeding 100 µg in 83% of patients.	1.2037241866298922
Our prospective study confirmed that the chosen protocol for SIT is effective in inducing tolerance to the venom preparation.	0.8978631415094313
However, using a purified aqueous yellow jacket preparation did not result in reduction of side effects.	1.0635234208052926
A 76 year old patient with actinic reticuloid was treated with Cyclosporin A.	0.9605722180841909
11 months after beginning the immunosuppressive therapy, he developed lymphoedema and livid nodular skin lesions of the right leg, which histologically showed Kaposi's sarcoma.	1.0855507203160701
After stopping the Cyclosporin A and intralesional therapy with Interferon alpha, no regression of the Kaposi sarcoma could be seen.	1.00803557540108
The characteristics of Kaposi sarcoma arising during immunosuppressive therapy and the differences in incidence, risk groups and distribution pattern compared to the classic sporadic and the AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma will be described.	1.0542566470379697
The development of Kaposi sarcoma during immunosuppressive therapy for actinic reticuloid has not been previously described.	0.8030060779759628
This analysis was undertaken to review the outcome and toxicity of postoperative adjuvant therapy for Stage II and III rectal cancer.	1.0063603057639128
We reviewed 112 patients treated with radiotherapy (44 patients) and radiochemotherapy (68 patients) after potentially curative (R0) surgery for rectal cancer (UICC Stages II and III), between 1983 and 1994 at the University Clinic of Würzburg.	1.2668922681985857
Median radiation dose was 56 Gy (range: 45 to 66 Gy).	0.9122106281132718
Chemotherapy consisted of 4 to 6 courses of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (420 mg/m2/d) and leucovorin (200 mg/m2/d).	1.0809737891748061
Median follow-up was 37 months.	1.0765769703160313
The overall survival was 84% for patients with UICC Stage II and 45% for patients with UICC Stage III disease (p = 0.0045).	0.939187127797786
There were no statistically significant differences between patients treated with radiochemotherapy vs radiotherapy in terms of 5-year survival (63% after radiochemotherapy vs 53% after radiotherapy, p = 0.16), relapse-free survival (52% vs 50%) and locoregional control (69% vs 67%).	1.2622334980623044
UICC Stage III disease was associated with high failure rates (40% pelvic recurrences and 53% distant metastases).	0.9322182579883085
There was a statistically significant difference in terms of the incidence of distant metastases between the 2 treatment modalities for patients with Stage III disease (49% 5-year probability for developing distant metastases after radiochemotherapy vs 66% after radiotherapy, p = 0.047).	1.0309502912343056
In a multivariate analysis, the addition of chemotherapy, lymph node stage and grading were independent prognostic factors for survival.	0.9349924531772226
Severe late toxicity was documented in 5% of treated patients.	1.1855713640102914
Prognosis of patients with UICC Stage III rectal cancer remains poor after "standard" surgery followed by postoperative adjuvant treatment (pelvic radiotherapy and bolus intravenous injection of 5-FU and leucovorin).	0.99986592473154
Major efforts should be made in order to improve prognosis for these patients, including optimization of surgical treatment and systemic treatment.	1.26596311673308
More effective multimodality treatment strategies should be investigated in prospective randomized trials.	0.8576116786751335
Andy Warhol underwent dermabrasion in 1957 because of a nasal skin lesion, which is best diagnosed as a rhinophyma on the basis of the available biographical literature.	1.1718822469568377
Throughout his creative life, the artist worked on different aspects of plastic surgery especially in the nasal area.	1.047347196652659
As one of the founders of Pop-Art, Warhol left essential marks on the modern society and influenced our standards of aesthetic shapes.	0.8063928267687835
Objective: The clinical activity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is not reliably reflected by laboratory measures.	1.1701870892738617
Proteolytic enzymes involved in the cascade of joint destruction are potentially useful parameters to monitor the extent of joint inflammation in RA.	0.937468500073702
This study compares the validity of two classes of proteolytic enzymes, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and lysosomal cysteine proteinases (cathepsin B, H, and L) as well as their respective inhibitors to serve as parameters of RA disease activity.	1.0294722252886261

Invasive selective coronary angiography as a clinical method is about 40 years old.	0.9390263009858353
This article surveying this period, written by an R&D engineer, deals with four parts: first the situation before 1965 is touched upon.	0.8780408832233435
For the time after 1965 the second and third parts describe the development of the procedure and of the technique with special reference to the work of Prof. Dr. K. Bachmann and to the facility, which in 1967 was designed together with him and further developed.	1.2468772620349493
K. Bachmann had already taken up the method of invasive coronary angiography around 1965, which makes him one of the group of pioneering users who developed the fundamentals of the procedure and led coronary angiography to its self-evident use today.	1.1280401576587824
The first clinical application of high resolution image intensifiers with the input screen produced from evaporated cesium iodide in 1971 appears as one of the highlights of the continuous improvements of the facility.	0.9227049105728815
The fourth part of the article sketches the status of today and, considering the new methods using MRI, EBCT as well as CT, it predicts that the invasive coronary angiography will remain an indispensable method at least for the medium-term future.	1.0908724733550512
Proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole) have revolutionized the therapy of peptic disease of the upper gastrointestinal tract and reduced the indications for surgical intervention.	1.1002514256315874
These substances inhibit the H+/K+-ATPase in the parietal cells with an acid suppressing potency that is much higher than that of H2-receptor-antagonists.	0.8962337421191351
The first proton pump inhibitor, omeprazole, has been introduced ten years ago.	0.9587867544187922
Since then, sufficient experience with this drug in children has accumulated.	1.0865781322948964
Omeprazole is released for children aged one year or older.	0.8078343872018955
A new formulation makes the drug applicable in tube fed patients.	0.7200348467016577
The main indications for the use of omeprazole are endoscopically verified peptic esophagitis and gastric and duodenal ulcerations of different etiologies.	0.9042707123544699
In the treatment of Helicobacter pylori-infection a sufficient acid suppression is essential for the efficacy of the antibiotics.	0.93717470067507
The recommended pediatric dose ranges between 0,7-1,4 mg/kg bodyweight and day.	1.152164590387262
However, some children with ulcerative esophagitis may need daily doses up to 3.5 mg/kg.	1.2588095337409808
Healing of the esophageal mucosa should be monitored by endoscopy.	0.8481203688931057
After remission, doses can often be reduced for maintenance therapy.	0.8584155321242003
Side effects are rare and do not seem to increase with higher doses.	1.1619456537120567
Possibly interactions with other medications, i.e.	0.5103897731034364
antiepileptic drugs, may occur.	0.7220430865115464
A long-term therapy lasting more than 6 months in a child should be monitored by an experienced pediatric gastroenterologist.	1.139402934842075
Nosocomial urinary tract infections (UTI) are frequent complications after transurethral prostatectomy.	0.9807511481624148
The resection itself, postoperative catheterization and the prostate are possible causes of these infections.	1.094774295692185
In this prospective study we investigated the influence of bacterial prostatic colonization on the incidence of postoperative urinary tract infections and inflammatory complications.	1.0157882181732671
In 78 patients we observed in 42 cases (53,8%) a bacterial prostatitis.	1.3519453529938925
In 14 patients (17,9%) we found nosocomial UTI's and in 12 patients (15,4%) inflammatory complications.	1.3379157845680294
The incidence of postoperative UTI's increase significantly in patients with positive prostate-cultures.	1.0266333087320545
On the other hand we only found corresponding prostate- and postoperative urine-cultures in less than 50%.	1.228212569190014
The presented data are not sufficient to conclude the kind of relevance of bacterial prostatic colonization for postoperative UTI's in transurethral prostatectomy.	0.8974038800027153
Under consideration of the significant increase of nosocomial UTI's in patients with positive prostate cultures a perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis seems to be required in general.	1.0313824377840095
Apnea, bradycardia and oxygen desaturation in infants with very low birth weight are common findings in neonatal intensive care.	0.8911068123335948
The prognostic significance of their intensity and frequency and the principles of treatment, however, are controversial.	1.1071000573976808
The universal aim, in order to prevent traumatization of the lung, is to ventilate infants with very low birth weight for as short a time as possible.	1.1010206934860307
Therefore drugs such as theophylline, aminophylline and doxapram and techniques such as nasal CPAP have been studied in our neonatal intensive care unit.	0.8384857802054753
In these studies we developed a treatment algorithm.	0.9351992867744325
In two clinically controlled studies performed successively we first proved that sodium acetate theophylline given intravenously has the same efficacy as aminophylline.	0.8164632181297098
As aminophylline has more side effects, sodium acetate theophylline is preferable.	0.6771924330016995
Bradycardia, apnea and desaturation were registered from the print-out of the monitoring system's trend analysis and in a polysomnographic study during steady-state conditions.	0.943009340685514
In a historical study we were able to prove that intravenous injection of aminophylline is superior to oral administration.	0.8849477541390044
We demonstrated equal efficacy of doxapram and theophylline; however, doxapram reduced the rate of apnea significantly more during the first 3 days of treatment.	1.0690380098673178
In a retrospective study we analyzed the efficacy of nasal CPAP as the third level of treatment.	1.0710390782852868
The rate of bradycardia, apnea and desaturation was significantly reduced during CPAP and respiratory rate and oxygenation improved.	0.9011135728946285
The algorithm developed established theophylline with 5 mg/ kg as bolus infusion over 20 min, followed by 3 mg/kg BID as the first line of treatment.	1.0135159349112672
Only if a quick therapeutic response was desirable was doxapram the first drug of choice (indication >=4 bradycardias below 80/min, 4 desaturations below 80% or 2 apneas of >=20 s over 2 h).	1.0944533536503909
After 48 h an additional second drug was added if we could still observe >=3 apneas, 15 bradycardias or 15 desaturations over this period.	0.9359021282999214
Nasal CPAP was introduced as the third line of treatment.	0.8237339630255307
With this treatment algorithm we were able to reduce the time on a respirator of infants with very low birth weight from 4.9 to 3.4 days (P<0.01).	0.9628035161008498
An evaluation of similar treatment algorithms in multi-institutional studies is indicated.	0.6999181280224311
Background: Associations between back pain, the quality of sleep and the quality of matresses have not yet been investigated systematically.	1.1952766033783186
Methods: At check-out we asked 265 consecutive guests of a trade fair hotel about the subjective quality of sleep in the previous night.	1.1094342513040012
Nine rooms had been equipped with new mattresses of three different qualities and prices, but this was kept blind to the hotel staff and the guests.	1.081705949288922
Sleep quality was assessed on an analog scale between 1 (very good) and 5 (very bad) and was analyzed in comparison to the remaining 8-year old mattresses of the hotel, but also with respect to social (e.g.	1.3895670998451441
private vs. professional reason for the stay) as well as personal (e.g.	0.7720599843304392
previous experience with low back and sleep complaints) characteristics of the guests.	0.9248935973923085
Results: The three qualities of the mattresses correlated significantly and positively with the perceived quality of sleep, but the difference to the "old" mattresses was most pronounced for those guests who were staying overnight for professional reasons, or who frequently were suffering from low back pain or sleep disturbances.	1.1164033601806622
Conclusion: At least for chronic sufferers from back pain and sleep problems, the association between sleep quality and quality of the mattress is significant.	1.2854362056842261
Body oriented psychotherapy is used nowadays in in-patient and out-patient settings, individually or in groups, alone or combined with other methods.	0.9869087208833818
These methods have special importance in patients whose body feeling is reduced, who are restricted in their emotions, or for those who are difficult to reach because of resistances of character.	1.1170865330975763
Short examples are given as an introduction to the methods used often the most nowadays, reference is made to other procedures.	1.0265700357010756
The connection of emotions to the vegetative and autonomic nervous system inter alia and the link between emotional and physical processes which is especially strong to the beginning of life and which combines with the specifically experienced form of interaction and has psychobiological consequences are mentioned as active factors.	0.9842173340391415
In later development, the body and certain parts of the body acquire a symbolical meaning too, which is important for the therapy.	1.222497200002387
The relationship of body oriented procedures to verbal psychotherapy and especially to psychoanalysis shall also be discussed.	0.9898703821407872
Approaches to empirical research are pointed out.	0.5521864211709442
Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes are rare diseases that occur in relation to cancer.	0.8805283327771225
Supporting the hypothesis of an autoimmune mechanism, specific antineuronal antibodies have sometimes been detected.	0.9244587236086373
The current possibilities for treatment are limited.	0.8201166467941008
A female patient, aged 57, suffering from a breast cancer, developed a severe paraneoplastic cerebellar syndrome and limbic encephalitis within a few weeks.	1.0112452485130068
It is possible that the impressive partial remission that occurred during the ensuing 6 months was not due to therapy.	1.0605553801134497
Although the patient was still bound to a wheelchair, discharge from hospital was possible because she was still able to perform daily tasks by herself.	1.0892078387585173
A recurrence of the cerebellar symptoms with mild alterations of mental status occurred 2 months later but again showed a good remission.	0.9689595092313925
The outcome in 163 patients treated for an abdominal aortic aneurysm in the department for vascular and thoracic surgery since its institution 5 years ago is investigated.	1.1368109331480702
Some 142 patients underwent operative aneurysm repair; 21 (13%) were excluded from operation.	1.0984093617870403
In 108 (66%) an elective procedure was performed, an emergency operation for rupture 34 times (21%).	1.143874733307222
In 16% of cases one or both renal arteries or the inferior mesenteric or the internal iliac artery were reimplanted.	1.1880842676578167
For further analysis the patients were split in three groups: elective group 1, symptomatic group 2, ruptured group 3.	1.0577114329375237
Significant differences were found in the aneurysmal diameter, distribution of gender (128 M, 14 F), renal artery involvement, or concomitant peripheral arteriosclerosis as well as for the risk factors tobacco smoking, hyperlipidemia, renal insufficiency, and the presence of multiple risk factors.	1.2032481047724974
Group 1 had a significantly higher preoperative hospital stay than group 2; whereas the intensive care stay was significantly longer in group 3 than in the other two groups.	1.1426467131889257
Sixty-four percent of patients had no, 11% had more than one complication.	1.3653167455174136
Mortality was 0 in groups 1 and 2, but 35.3% in group 3.	1.2856925092791835
The most frequent complication in groups 1 and 2 was pneumonia (13.9%) followed by cardiac complications (4.6%), and renal insufficiency (3.7%).	1.2783109386167255
In group 3 respiratory insufficiency demonstrated the highest incidence (23.5%), followed by renal insufficiency (21%) and pneumonia (17.6%).	1.085743353356276
No patient of the nonoperated group suffered an aneurysm rupture; aneurysm diameters, except one, did not increase during the follow-up period.	0.9662756465495582
Of the 130 operated and discharged patients 31 died; in no case was death related to the operative procedure.	0.9064925400783905
No important complications were observed during the follow-up of 37.2 +/- 17.9 months.	1.13188828217981
Furthermore, the results are compared with those of the literature.	1.4458418779680124
Based on their observations the authors conclude that this retrospective quality check was rather awkward and involved giving partly incomplete data for lack of a prospective evaluation.	1.0122988911088737
Nevertheless, the results compared well with those in the literature and were satisfactory.	1.4346197672844943
We report on a 32-year-old male patient with advanced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), who had severe candidiasis of the gastrointestinal tract.	1.1614849596849832
Treatment with fluconazole, 200 mg/day, was introduced.	0.9251457400352977
After oral intake of fluconazole over 5 months itraconazole 200 mg/day was given for 1 month.	0.9670394183987281
However, fungal infection still persisted.	1.2019211718868865
The antifungal activity of fluconazole, itraconazole and ketoconazole against Candida albicans was evaluated by means of the microdilution test by determining the 90% inhibitory concentrations of each drugs.	0.9540287650716696
A high minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was detected for fluconazole (50 µg/ml) revealing fluconazole resistance.	1.0905487645734848
The susceptibility to itraconazole was borderline (MIC 0.125 µg/ml) and that to ketoconazole was markedly lowered (MIC 0.25 µg/ml).	0.9285206093125802
Plasma levels of itraconazole were also found to be lowered.	1.0145350627338077
In HIV patients the gastrointestinal absorption of azole derivatives is often reduced.	0.8381177848202199
Therefore, the clinical resistance of Candida albicans to itraconazole can be explained by reduced susceptibility after azole therapy and also by the decreased absorption of the drug in HIV patients.	1.2159236935745905
Patients suffering from soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities may sometimes require vascular reconstruction to remove the tumor with adequate margins of clearance.	0.9063911053703998
Besides this, recurrent lymph node metastases are often affixed to neighboring vessels.	0.9519485234419413
MRI and angiography represent the adequate diagnostic procedures.	0.7639595257269097
Vessel-invasive sarcoma can hardly be treated by surgical resection with curative intent alone.	0.9683951717665268
If there is doubt about invasion of arteries and veins, the vessels should be resected and replaced by autologous vein graft.	0.982549171534873
Soft tissue coverage is of major importance, particularly if prosthetic grafts are used or the resection is within an area of irradiated tissue.	1.0612938996840426
After radical resection and combined modality therapy, one can expect local recurrence rates similar to those without vessel invasion.	1.0467377779223195
To achieve this goal, surgical oncologists, vascular surgeons and plastic surgeons must work together.	1.1070847345342962
Today, amputation can hardly be justified even in vessel-invasive soft tissue tumors.	0.956588518047401
The study aimed to evaluate whether superimposed high-frequency jet ventilation (SHFJV) is a useful tool in intensive care medicine to ventilate patients with pulmonary insufficiency.	1.2052562808407155
Surgery on the lacrimal system in 296 children was performed at the Münster University Eye Hospital from 1987 to 1992.	0.903007348034913
The dermatology clinic in Krefeld has treated a wide range of patients since its founding in 1845.	0.9195359331867474
Nowadays the spectrum consists of allergology, occupational dermatology, phototherapy, dermatosurgery, phlebology and proctology as well as special clinics for andrology, sexually transmitted diseases and patients with HIV-infection.	0.8748030931703894
Background: Dapiprazole hydrochloride is an alpha-1-adrenergic inhibitor that anticipates the mydriatic effect of phenylephrine in dilator muscle receptors in a competitive way.	1.0456563752112156
The aim of this study was to determine for which indications for mydriasis pupil dilation by phenylephrine alone is sufficient and if the reversal by dapiprazole is convenient and the practical.	0.905524546796171
The Quality Assurance programmes of the social security insurance authorities are presented from the point of view of psychosomatic rehabilitation.	1.1080442161185045
This presentation attempts to introduce aspects of both Quality Assurance and Quality Management into the field of medical rehabilitation.	1.0280756965331066
The consequences of the programme for political order are emphasized.	0.709240122796333
The special features of the individual programme objectives are elaborated.	0.9315133466037335
In addition, the importance of each of these objectives for psychosomatic rehabilitation is examined.	0.9021008941303101
This field will inevitably have to adopt concepts of time and resource optimization.	0.8165745213845702
For many years the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome has been on the top of medical articles about the intensive care patient.	0.9813057575649466
While severity scores deal with the 1st ICU day physiology, the organ dysfunction systems aim to take in account the duration type and severity of physiologic disturbances during the ICU stay.	1.0108705941585008
Most of the published systems have been created by a panel of experts, giving to each dysfunction a number of points, usually 1 to 4, according to the severity.	1.0692802011740317
Only 2 systems are different: the MODS of Marshall et al.	0.8328043482423377
and the Logistic Organ Dysfunction LOD system of Le Gall et al., both published recently (1995 and 1996).	1.1011126762233192
They differ from the others because first they were created either from a literature review (MDOS) or from a logistic regression (LOD), and secondly, because neither takes into account the therapy.	1.1877168934703886
Besides, the LOD system, when used on the 1st ICU day, has statistical qualities which are very promising.	1.27099563930304
The LOD system is now used each consecutive day on septic patients in an European multicenter study.	0.8648084164008003
The relationsship between the growth of tumors and the expression of the protooncogen Bcl-2 could be shown in epithelial tumors.	1.035180824153782
A bcl-2 expression leads to a prolonged cell survival due to an inhibition of apoptosis.	1.0144455506461143
The potential meaning of bcl-2 expression in mesenchymal tumors remains still unknown.	0.7599878077033513
The fact, that the heterogenous group of osteosarkoma is not sufficiently characterized at present, suggested to investigate the bcl-2 expression in osteosarcoma.	1.0635951105466064
Thus, immunohistochemistry was used to analyze 47 specimens of different osteosarcomas of 36 patients.	1.1821242189498247
Sixteen cases (46 %) showed a strong expression of bcl-2 and 13 cases (35 %) were moderately positiv for bcl-2.	1.1364739325347073
Seven cases (19 %) were negative for bcl-2.	1.0625411997573597
The heterogenous, negative up to strong expression of bcl-2 yield clues, that the Bcl-2 controlled regulation of programmed cell death could be an important factor of cellular kinetics.	1.0845774097216343
Additionally the cellular proliferationrate was determined with the monoklonal antibody MIB 1, directed against the Ki-67 epitop.	0.8248836790757451
The data of bcl-2 expression and cellular proliferationrate lead to a classification correlating with the histological classification.	1.0751430550894305
To verify the importance of apoptosis in the genesis of mesenchymal tumors and whether Bcl-2 may play an important role as a predictive factor for the prognosis of osteosarcoma, further investigations will be needed.	1.0615180493140592
During a period of two weeks in hot dry midsummer 3 patients presented in our pediatric outpatient clinic after a bath in a small lake.	1.0491064772214238
They had an extremely itching, elevated exanthema mainly on their legs.	0.8997337516194345
The single efflorescence had a diameter of about 1-3 cm.	0.9232229351946495
There were no signs of infection or fever.	0.9554358064757495
Intussusception of the appendix vermiformis in adults is an uncommon event.	1.0548118832739977
The combination of a mucinous cystadenoma with an intussuscepted appendix is extremely rare.	0.7892051568744204
Clinical symptoms are nonspecific; in most cases the correct diagnosis is not made before surgical exploration.	1.1100115361778264
With the radiologic and endoscopic presentation of a polypoid lesion of the caecum, a neoplasm is often considered.	1.059112306998013
Endoscopic appendectomy or disinvagination by enema have been described.	0.5742928438293374
Thus the definitive therapy is surgery and depends on the histological diagnosis.	0.8814764252316635
There are some case reports about excessive heat production in the absorbent canister when sevoflurane or enflurane are washed into a circle containing dried soda lime.	0.8286951282605634
This observation was often made in the DRÄGER ISO 8 circle system with the gas inlet upstream of the soda lime canister with the gas-flow from bottom to top.	0.8889374085284683
Abstract:  MR-imaging of the spinal column using Turbo-Spin-Echo-Sequences (TSE) often shows flow-void structures resembling intraspinal vessels.	1.1262594124590026
Due to misinterpretation of those phenomenons invasive diagnostic procedures may be performed to diagnose an arteriovenous malformation (myelography, spinal angiography).	0.9724630523298887
Purpose: To compare the effectiveness of spiral CT versus conventional CT in the preoperative assessment of metallic intraocular foreign bodies.	1.0982347175817244
Surgery is still the primary therapeutic approach in treatment of tumors in the head and neck area, dating back to the early nineteenth century.	1.0173201880262175
More than 150 years ago, hemimaxillectomies and mandibular resections as well as hemiglossectomies were already performed by leading surgeons.	0.8614569705854581
The block principle we are now following dates back to Crile, who also established the principle of cervical lymph node dissection.	1.0180866566985078
Ablative oncologic surgery has always been closely linked with plastic and reconstructive surgery, rendering radical surgical interventions possible without disfiguring patients.	0.8862941426289593
The development of facial reconstructive surgery proceeded in stages, in the first instance as secondary reconstruction using tube pedicled flaps.	1.130040363768939
The change to the concept of primary reconstruction occurred via arterialized skin flaps and myocutaneous flaps to the widely accepted and performed free tissue transfer.	0.9041901169105948
Free bone grafting, inaugurated earlier and still representing the majority of bone grafting, has been supplemented for certain reconstructive purposes by free vascularized bone transfer from various donor sites.	1.003643081743759
Although the five-year-survival rate of carcinoma of the oral cavity has remained unchanged in the past 30 years, distinctive improvements in tumor surgery can be recorded.	1.1056162875001965
This is primarily based on improved diagnostics such as modern imaging techniques and the refinement of surgical techniques.	1.0106851232080845
The DÖSAK has worked out distinctive guidelines for effective ablative oncologic surgery.	0.7736684958768595
Surgical approaches offering wide exposure and carrying low morbidity play a decisive role in radical resections.	0.8010290748098312
For this reason, midfacial degloving offers an essential improvement for the resection of midface tumors, especially from an aesthetic point of view.	1.0577486747681866
Tumors situated deep behind the viscerocranium at the skull base can be clearly exposed either through a lateral approach following a temporary osteotomy of the mandibular ramus or a transmandibular, transmaxillar, or transfacial approach with minimal morbidity.	0.9166698405229335
Concerning the concept of neck dissection, radical techniques are more and more abandoned in favor of a more conservative procedure.	0.9180089626024324
Actual inquiries concerning present surgical procedures as to the surgical strategy in "No-neck" or marginal and segmental resection in mandibular adherent carcinomas demand scientific clarification.	1.0513245358870047
Laser treatment of various skin changes has become common clinical practice in recent years.	1.0312790283219344
Due to its physical properties, the CO2 laser is particularly well suited for cutting and ablating tissue.	0.9783343543089739
The high absorption of its wavelength in water (=10600 nm) is responsible for its low penetration depth in biological tissue.	0.9072127318866349
Shortening the exposure time minimizes thermal side effects, such as carbonization and coagulation.	0.799179579949756
This effect can be lessened with the SilkTouch scanner, since the focussed laser beam is moved over a defined area by rapidly rotating mirrors.	0.9395914863155708
This enables a controlled and reliable removal of various dermal lesions.	0.8505319580467804
Particularly well-suited for treatment hypertrophic scars, post-acne scarring, perioral and periorbital wrinkles, rhinophymas and benign neoplasms including verruca vulgaris.	0.801449726234554
Cosmetically favorable reepithelialization of the treated skin surfaces occurs within a very short time after treatment.	0.8927375089620245
Periorbital resurfacing and correction of a rhinophyma are used as examples of dermal treatment with the CO2 laser and the SilkTouch scanner.	1.010598501533796
Acute spinal cord injury affects more than 3000 individuals per year with predominantly young people between 15 and 20 years of age being involved.	0.8950716192588029
Analysis of the modern emergency management has revealed that the prognosis of acute spinal trauma depends decisively on the initial treatment at the accident site as well as good acute emergency care.	1.1110779209316037
Therefore, there is the urgent need to brain the medical staff so that injuries are diagnosed correctly and appropriate treatment be performed.	1.2958058511434083
The first hours after the accident are decisive, because injuries due to the primary and especially secondary trauma are difficult to correct later.	1.154566825321256
Besides the fate of the individual patient, the care provider has to be aware of the high economic impact caused by intensive care, long lasting rehabilitation, as well as post rehabilitative care.	1.1119812463430057
Chronic or repeated stress can induce a damage of neurons, expecially in hippocampus, by which the degree of damage differs in various species.	0.954865646147175
Sapolski has reported that there is a correlation between hippocampal degeneration, disturbed feed-back reaction, and hypersecretion of glucocorticoids.	0.9391847600461531
The aim of this study was to investigate if the signal transmission via glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in the brain of male wistar rats of two age groups (5-6 and 17-24 months, respectively) is changed in aging and which cytoplasmic factors/modulators participate in this process.	1.2062965575126614
Introduction: The treatment of soft tissue defects of the foot and ankle region remains a challenge, because special anatomical and physiological properties have to be considered.	1.1067254623678944
Patients and methods: The data of 52 patients, who were treated between 1994 and 1998, were analyzed.	1.1695797968581987
48 % were posttraumatic defects and were located in the weight bearing zone in 37 %.	1.132977136595405
Results: Fifty-nine procedures were used, including skin transplantation in 16 patients, local flaps in 3 cases, regional flaps in 14 cases, and microvascular procedures in 17 cases.	1.2774706061651089
Amputation was required in 4 patients.	0.7884004230019324
The overall success rate was 92 %.	0.5455712157158261
Complications occurred in 18 patients.	0.4316630221772633
Conclusions: Using these data and evaluation of the actual literature lead to the development of an algorithm for the treatment of defects in this area.	1.282089636035296
The modern armamentarium of plastic surgery offers the possible different treatment modalities.	0.7636695882344271
The conventional multichannel electroencephalogram is quite inconvenient for long-term monitoring in the operating theatre or intensive care unit.	0.8852691814093857
Recording of the EEG would be easier if a small number of channels was sufficient.	0.8272208977508921
Aiming at reduction of channels, leads from different regions of the scalp were analysed visually and with regard to their spectral content.	0.9955939836099155
APC resistance was first discovered in 1993.	0.6687773670532376
It is the most frequent cause of thrombophilia in Europe and North America.	0.960500317166146
In more than 90% of cases, the underlying cause of APC resistance is a single point mutation in the factor V gene.	1.0427426181867074
Heterozygous patients have a between five- and ten-fold higher risk of developing venous thrombosis, while in homozygous patients the risk is increased up to between 50- and 100-fold.	1.2806719079773017
Where there is a previous history of thrombosis, a careful investigation of the coagulation system, in particular a determination of the APC ratio, is recommended prior to surgery.	1.3247899920178614
In patients with APC resistance, a body-weight-specific thrombosis prophylaxis with heparin is recommended.	1.0909160647985765
Heterozygous patients only need anticoagulation when additional risk conditions are present, while homozygous patients with thromboembolic disease should be anticoagulated over a long period of time.	0.9594257263511212
Primary varicosis of the saphenous system should be treated promptly by surgery to minimize the additional risk of thrombotic complications.	0.9940045907216157

Since the patients symptoms and the clinical and laboratory findings are relatively unspecific, the clinical diagnosis of pyomyositis can present difficulties.	1.3873247535237878
Furthermore, cases of pyomyositis are rare in non-tropical countries and some physicians may not be familiar with it.	1.1770629720879733
If not diagnosed and treated properly, pyomyositis can lead to sepsis and death.	0.7819766581566125
Although the pathogenesis of the disease has not yet been clarified, some predisposing factors of forensic interest are well known: (trivial) trauma or vigorous exercise of the affected skeletal muscles, small potentially "septic" foci in other tissues or internal organs and a preexisting immunodeficiency, e. g. in diabetes mellitus, intravenous drug abusers or individuals suffering from HIV.	1.173774997618351
Three cases of "non-tropical" pyomyositis with fatal outcome are presented and the literature on the subject is reviewed with special reference to epidemiological and etiological factors, taking forensic aspects, histomorphologic findings and the problems of post-mortem diagnosis of pyomyositis into consideration.	1.1613371135142305
Aim of the study: The etiology of persistent crying during early infancy has been only insufficiently elucidated.	0.9410503801480216
Based upon recent data from the "Munich Interdisciplinary Research and Intervention Program (MIRIP)", this paper shall discuss and challenge well known explanatory models.	1.142883317730188
In addition, novel approaches of intervention shall be presented.	1.0026549784408028
Because tumour cell invasion is a three-dimensional process involving tumour cells as well as stromal cells, tumour invasion models should include equivalents of both compartments in a spatially defined organisation.	0.9735522946459613
Aims: Evaluation of differentiation and invasive potential in relation to basement membrane (BM) formation of new human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines under the influence of fibromatosis fibroblasts in a 3D co-culture system (collagen type I/fibroblast-containing matrix).	0.9356742365945421
Material and methods: OSCC cell lines were established and cultured on collagen type I matrix with and without the inclusion of fibro-/myofibroblasts derived from nodular palmar fibromatosis).	0.94511454072259
Evaluation of invasion was done by conventional H & E staining after paraffin embedding; immunohistochemistry was performed for cytokeratins (MNF 116), involucrin (Sy5), vimentin (V9), collagen type IV (CIV22), laminin (1-chain, 4C7), and Ki-67 (MIB1); and electron microscopy followed.	1.2586390454981158
Results: The OSCC cell lines PE/CA-PJ15, PE/CA-PJ34, PE/CA-PJ41 were invasive exclusively on gels containing fibroblasts with stratification of the multilayerd OSCC cell coat and polarised expression of cytokeratin and involucrin.	0.8410299451216208
There was no evidence for BM, either by immunohistochemistry or by electron microscopy, although OSCC are immunohistochemically positive for collagen type IV and laminin in the 2D cell culture.	1.064193507314326
There were no differences in proliferative activity of the gels with and without fibroblasts.	0.8951251667342436
Conclusions: Carcinoma cell invasion depends on the presence of fibroblasts in the gel indicating the important role of tumor stromal fibro-/myofibroblasts during carcinomic invasion.	1.0886506257075805
The absence of a BM does not, per se, imply an invasive tumour growth.	0.8713079216119619
Moreover, stratification and terminanl differentiation of epithelial tumour cells occur independently of a structural BM.	1.0379725776491169
Interfragmentary movement and size of the fracture gap influence fracture healing.	0.9833159188568817
Limited movements promote callus formation and may result in increased mechanical stability.	0.8204598008934537
Although larger movements still promote callus formation, the bony consolidation of the fracture is hampered.	1.121563265011085
Fracture healing is also hampered if the size of the fracture gap is too large.	1.0006140348025379
A combination of large movement and large gap bears the risk of non-union.	0.8604850188181583
Therefore, having in mind a minimally invasive surgical approach, one should strive for good reduction of the fracture ends and flexible yet stable osteosynthesis.	1.2247891743191797
Dynamization of the fracture by enabling axial movement will close the fracture gap, stimulate tissue differentiation and possibly accelerate the healing process.	0.9695562000325431
External mechanical stimulation, however, has not been shown to effectively enhance the healing process under flexible fixation or in load-bearing patients.	1.1336525441519911
Although ketamine has been in clinical use for 3 decades, the neuropharmacological basis of its analgesic, anaesthetic, sympathomimetic, and psychotomimetic effects is still a subject of controversial discussion and intensive investigational efforts.	1.0875226882541575
In recent years, however, new experimental approaches to its effects on the cellular and molecular level and the availability of pure ketamine enantiomers contributed substantially to the understanding of its complex neuropharmacology.	1.0438552310727673
This article reviews the current knowledge of ketamine effects on ligand-operated and voltage-operated transmembrane ion channels, G-protein-coupled receptors, transmitter uptake, and the NO-cGMP system in neurons.	1.0625786243019542
With regard to its potential clinical relevance and supposed relative role among the complex mechanisms involved in pain perception, analgesia, anaesthesia, and psychotomimesis, the contributions of recent experimental and clinical findings to the identification of major target sites of ketamine are summarised.	1.086151665671302
In contrast to the uncertainty surrounding the potential role of opioid receptors, there is now considerable evidence that NMDA antagonism is a central mechanism that contributes to the amnesic, analgesic, anaesthetic, and psychotomimetic as well as the neuroprotective actions of ketamine.	1.1892032799938685
Moreover, the involvement of non-NMDA glutamate receptors, muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic transmission, interactions with 5-HT receptors, and L-Type Ca2+ channels may account for some of its anaesthetic and neuroprotective properties.	1.004591497342333
There is undoubtedly a need for a safe disinfection method of optical instruments used by ENT specialists.	0.9693176691364338
So far, a standard method that sufficiently covers the risk of infection for patients and medical staff alike while serving the need of practicability in daily routine has not been established.	1.1884365103458194
Therefore, in the ENT departments of the hospitals of Mannheim, Kaiserslautern, and Tübingen, studies on the disinfection of rigid optical instruments without working channel were performed between February 1999 and May 1999.	1.2201958177622723
Instruments were wiped either with an aldehyde or alcohol (ethanol 80%) and germs were detected by quantitative swab cultures.	0.9491888466282178
As discussed in the article, disinfection with ethanol proved to be at least equally efficient if not better than disinfection with aldehyde.	0.9566436347767988
Therefore, it fully serves the requirements of a safe method for disinfection optical instruments without working channels.	1.103881802115756
White piedra is a rare hair infection of man and certain animals, caused by the widespread Trichosporon fungi.	0.9717366832567519
The infection is characterized clinically by whitish, soft and easily removable coating of the hair shafts; however, the shafts may be destroyed by the pathogens invading at localized points.	0.9956727247636198
While all body hair may be affected, the pubic hair is most frequently affected.	1.0090853105592767
This paper is the first report genital white piedra in a 34-year-old Central European man.	1.104596616519812
In all, 22 cases have been described world-wide in young men ranging in age from 20 to 40 years.	1.0405239957831485
Only 2 men, aged 42 and 53 years, do not fall in this range.	0.891582488900793
Recently, a major African study disclosed this disease in women for the first time.	1.0775500762992847
In moderate latitudes, however, this infection appears to occur almost exclusively in young men.	1.030079814139984
In open fractures the rate of infected non-union defects has in recent years decreased due to the increased primary application of external fixation.	1.037316085789483
In spite of this positive state of affairs the condition is still encountered often enough to warrant specific treatment strategies and techniques.	0.9832464818646826
In the treatment of infected pseudarthroses the general principles of osteitis treatment are applied.	0.8772138081232798
This includes radical excision of infected pseudarthrotic bone and of the diseased surrounding soft tissue, provides mechanical stability in the non-union area and requires effective local treatment of the infection in combination with systemic, target-specific and temporary well-defined antibiotic therapy as well as procedures to improve local circulation.	1.1239754673414921
The incorporation of autogenous bone transplants in defects appears to depend on close contact between the transplant and the vascularized receiving site and on the quantity of the transplanted osseous material.	0.9530132292219345
A promising alternative method of dealing with extensive bone defects is osteogenesis produced by callus distraction; therefore special attention is given to Ilizarov's ring fixation system.	0.936431920765147
Unstable scar formation demands local muscular flaps or microvascularized free flap transfer, which seems to be superior to other methods.	0.9583549834250624
Aim of the study: Using phantom studies, a dedicated low-field MR system with 0.2 T and a whole-body MR-scanner with 1.0 T were compared.	1.2574021111104756
Many different mechanisms contribute to the etiopathogenesis of the so-called diabetic foot syndrome.	0.882382135016774
Among chronic complications, the diabetic foot syndrome is one of the most frequent causes of hospitalization.	1.0141265704584042
The relative risk of diabetic patients requiring an amputation is up to 45 times greater than in normal subjects.	0.8485880597857909
Sensory neuropathy, ischemia, and infection are the principal pathogenetic factors in the diabetic foot syndrome.	0.8672898392889594
In most cases, a painless trauma is the initial condition that leads to an ulcer.	0.9848355699117497
In this article, an overview of the different causes, clinical manifestations, and treatment options for a multidisciplinary team are discussed.	1.2396549108026196
Lung resection offers the best prospect of long-term survival in patients with nonmetastatic pulmonary neoplasia.	0.9200595302601643
In view of the dismal prognosis of unresected bronchial cancer, surgical resection should be encouraged even in patients with reduced cardiopulmonary function.	0.9973585643471138
Accurate estimation of the postoperative cardiopulmonary function is therefore desirable to avoid (a) refusal of potentially curative treatment and (b) severe postoperative disability.	1.0167202124651387
The origins of postresection morbidity and mortality are multifactorial.	0.8767150348889838
Thus, no single pulmonary function test or hemodynamic measurement can accurately and reliably predict postoperative cardiorespiratory complications.	1.1133963345555025
Criteria of functional operability should be based on percent of predicted value, so that patient's age, sex, and height will be taken into consideration.	0.9883268381598161
Exercise testing offers the advantage that both pulmonary and cardiac risk can be evaluated simultaneously.	0.9171445179476623
The high predictive value of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) in assessing postoperative morbidity and mortality is established.	1.0761956983212302
The calculation of predicted postoperative lung function (ppo) is of importance.	0.9900936167992158
The postoperative values for the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1-ppo), the transfer factor (TL,CO-ppo), and VO2max-ppo can be predicted by using the same formula.	1.0326090090585376
Patients with nearly normal lung function (FEV1, TL,CO > 75 % predicted) and no concomitant cardiac disease can undergo lung resection right up to pneumonectomy without further diagnostic procedures.	1.11520963425497
In the others, FEV1-ppo and TL,CO-ppo should be estimated first by taking into account the number of segments to be resected.	0.8574830479092745
Patients with values < 30 % predicted are usually regarded as being inoperable, whereas values > 40 % predicted qualify for resection without the need for further diagnostics.	1.2554635779411243
VO2max < 10 ml/kg/min or < 40 % predicted are prohibitive for surgery.	1.1676946682133789
If VO2max is > 20 ml/kg/min or > 75 % predicted, functional operability without limitation is given.	1.137012994914522
For those cases where diagnostic uncertainty still remains, FEV1-ppo, TL,CO-ppo, and VO2max-ppo can be calculated by means of quantitative lung scans.	0.849195253284046
Patients with either FEV1-ppo and TL,CO-ppo < 30 % predicted or VO2max-ppo < 8 ml/kg/min or < 35 % predicted are deemed inoperable.	1.1237613245008988
The treatment of acute of Achilles tendon rupture experienced a dynamic development in the last ten years.	1.0974674328470568
Decisive for this development was the application of MRI and above all the ultrasonography in the diagnostics of the pathological changes and injuries of tendons.	1.0724560707278816
The question of ruptue morphology as well as different courses of healing could be now evaluated objectively.	0.8759902127725746
These advances led consequently to new modalities in treatment concepts and rehabilitation protocols.	0.8682560565605449
The decisive input for improvements of the outcome results and particularly the shortening of the rehabilitation period came with introduction of the early functional treatment in contrast to immobilizing plaster treatment.	1.122631549240269
In a prospective randomized study (1987-1989) at the Trauma Dept.	1.1416943267897668
of the Hannover Medical School could show no statistical differences comparing functional non-operative with functional operative therapy with a special therapy boot (Variostabil/Adidas).	0.9773635528865636
The crucial criteria for therapy selection results from the sonografically measured position of the tendon stumps in plantar flexion (20  °).	1.0191536427068613
With complete adaptation of the tendons' ends surgical treatment does not achieve better results than non-operative functional treatment in term of tendon healing and functional outcome.	0.9252892274898876
Regarding the current therapeutic standards each method has is advantages and disadvantages.	0.8709422510623127
Both, the operative and non-operative functional treatment enable a stable tendon healing with a low risk of rerupture (1-2 %).	1.1504581219720598
Meanwhile there is consensus for early functional aftertreatment of the operated Achilles' tendons.	0.8587965965292103
There seems to be a trend towards non-operative functional treatment in cases of adaquate sonografical findings, or to minimal invasive surgical techniques.	1.100444140783235
Based on a case report, we offer brief guidelines on the perioperative management of patients with Sleep-Apnea-Syndrome (SAS) who present with a high incidence of a difficult airway and a high risk of respiratory depression during the perioperative period.	1.1906069206539853
A 39 year old male patient with a body mass index of 34,22 kg/m2 and receiving continuous-positive-airway-pressure- (CPAP) therapy for known SAS was scheduled for elective plastic surgery.	1.1620896979113138
After induction of anaesthesia and direct laryngoscopy no adequate airway could be established and the patient became hypoxic, hypercapnic and developed hypotension and bradycardia.	1.0327044834327914
With the use of a laryngeal mask airway the patient was stabilized and did not show neurologic sequale after immediate awakening.	1.0323513631161019
The following fiberoptic intubation of the awake patient, still showing tendency of upper airway obstruction, confirmed the difficult anatomical structures.	0.9431744962730572
The subsequent general anesthesia was uneventful.	0.6347875588834564
The patient received CPAP therapy and was monitored during the first postoperative night in the Intensive Care Unit.	1.0183893316082742
He made an uneventful recovery.	0.5703653833095059
He was advised to have regional anaesthesia or planned fiberoptic intubation, where possible, in the case of further anesthetic intervention.	1.079981387269783
SAS has major implications for the anaesthesiologist and whenever patients exhibiting the high risk factors (obesity, male sex, history of intense snoring, impaired daytime performance, nonrefreshing daytime naps) are presented for surgery this condition should be considered.	1.0498561519128364
Elective surgery should be postponed until after adequate examination and treatment when necessary.	0.8354431591919826
Patients with SAS should always be suspected of having cardiopulmonary dysfunctions such as hypertension, cardiac dysrhythmia or cor pulmonale.	0.8780323916220908
It is most important to avoid sedative premedication, to initiate CPAP therapy preoperatively, to encourage regional anaesthesia if possible and to ensure close monitoring over the complete perioperative period.	1.1426116625958873
Planned fiberoptic intubation, preferably with surgical personnel available for an emergency airway, is a safe method for the induction of anaesthesia.	1.0928369101080249
Postoperatively, patients are at high risk from respiratory depression, even in the awake state.	1.1322630581131543
Postoperative opioid analgesia, no matter what route, should only be given under close monitoring.	1.1136867673590352
Independently of regional or general anaesthesia there is an increased risk of respiratory depression in the middle of the first postoperative week, suspected to be caused by the catching up on lost REM-sleep, due to shifts in the normal sleep pattern during the first postoperative days.	1.1661005921578698
Life style measures (weight reduction and control, reduction of total fat calories to <30% of total calories, modification of fat intake to increased monounsaturated vegetable fat, increased intake of dietary fibers, increased physical activity, controlled stress relaxation) are the basis of longterm therapy of coronary heart disease.	1.1715144035222498
For transformation to daily life both patient and doctor need motivation, information, patience, and realistic aimes.	0.9633360744528692
For realization the 10 rules of medical information should be followed.	0.8873267646579875
The patient must be informed that the "new lifestyle" is not punishing but means a new quality of life.	1.092092050441191
With respect to the most important metabolic syndrome with hyperinsulinemia due to insulin resistance, weight reduction is the most important measure for preventing complications of atherosclerosis.	1.163498701139202
The patient should use a diary for weight control and blood pressure selfmeasurement.	0.8949626860201729
IOL implantation in childhood is still controversial.	0.6874028718972041
Background: Increases in serum calcium are often detected by chance.	1.224852988945222
They warrant a prompt diagnostic work-up to identify the underlying cause.	1.0346219070690656
In the present review we describe our experience with debridement in necrotizing pancreatitis, with particular emphasis on the indications for surgery and the outcome in patients with infected and sterile necrosis.	1.3737445397144423
Within 7 years 64 patients with necrotizing pancreatitis underwent surgery with a median preoperative APACHE II score of 9.	1.0033193316421838
The indications for surgery were either proven infection or persistence of symptoms.	0.8628404238159116
Thirty-six patients were found to have infected necrosis, while 28 patients had sterile necrosis.	1.1215283883603147
There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding pre- and postoperative parameters.	1.0851795478423547
The surgical technique involved a blunt necrosectomy followed by closed packing with Penrose drains.	0.849938368633133
This technique produced the lowest reported mortality of 6.2 % with a reoperation rate of only 17 %, demonstrating that even with sterile necrosis surgical management can be carried out safely.	1.2212447309786838
The incidence of postoperative myocardial infarction (MI) is proportional to the incidence of myocardial ischaemic episodes.	1.0664795400630944
Therefore, the prevention of such episodes is of great clinical importance.	1.1679717135156817
The absorption of large volumes of irrigation fluid is a major problem in transurethral prostatic surgery (TUR-P).	0.890645631155823
Various indicators have been tested to monitor fluid absorption with regard to continuous registration and sufficient accuracy.	0.8978649308553899
The volumetric fluid balance is not suitable as a routine method because of its inaccuracy.	0.9720284642455392
Easily accessible parameters are unspecific because of surgical bleeding (haematocrit [Hct]), or are interfered with by physiological counter-regulatory actions (serum sodium [Na] concentration).	0.9629768504768405
In 1986 Hulten et al.	0.4566999557294927
suggested adding 2% ethanol to the irrigation fluid as a marker and investigated it intermittently in the expired air with an alcohol-test appliance.	1.0308964755076626
In a prospective clinical study of 17 patients undergoing TUR-P under spinal anaesthesia, expiratory concentrations of alcohol that was added to the irrigation fluid (2% ethanol in Purisole, Fresenius, Bad Homburg) were monitored.	1.236219545561746
Gas was continuously sampled from the nasopharynx through a nasal cannula and the ethanol concentration was measured using a modified diverting anaesthetic gas monitor (Normac, Datex, Helsinki) that allows continuous as well as early detection of the absorbed irrigation fluid with reliable accuracy for clinical use.	0.9970267715267601
In addition, at intervals of 10 minutes we measured blood alcohol, endtidal alcohol (Alcotest 7110, Drauml;ger, Lübeck), haematocrit, serum Na concentration, and blood gases.	1.1727600746827325
Sixty-eight measurements were obtained from the 17 patients.	0.8285783501105016
As shown in other studies, serum Na (r2 = 0.68) and Hct (r2 = 0.39) correlated poorly with the irrigation fluid as determined by serum alcohol levels.	0.9472306970440976
In contrast, the expiratory alcohol measurements with the alcotest 7110 (r2 = 0.93) and Normac devices (r2 = 0.85) were closely related.	1.0313482129662506
Continuous monitoring of the expiratory alcohol concentration with a Normac monitor closely reflects blood alcohol concentrations, and may hence serve as a useful semiquantitative monitor of irrigation fluid absorption during TUR-P.	0.9710281892596693
Between 1986 and 1996, 21 patients had a tibiocalcanear arthrodesis.	0.9131294692098587
Indications for surgery were in all cases either osteomyelitis or avascular necrosis of the talus.	1.0756312922468323
External stabilisation was used in 17 patients due to severe soft tissue damage or extensive infection of the talus, internal screw fixation was used in four patients.	1.1795750032815124
There were eight complications in seven patients, one patient had a below the knee amputation.	1.128396900452981
The leg length discrepancies after resection of the talus was equalised in four cases with callus distraction using an Ilisarov ring fixator.	1.0334273553688111
Follow up evaluation was available in 18 patients after an average of 38 months (12-86 mo.).	1.0708654049231958
There were no infectious recurrenies during the follow up period and a solid fusion was achieved in all patients that were followed.	1.3644096084433122
According to a modified Kitaoka score, results were excellent and good in 12 of the 18patients.	1.1218400558577595
External stabilisation, especially the Ilisarov ring fixator is the primary method of treatment in cases with severe infection or soft tissue damage.	1.2980435211266985
Intraoperative autotransfusion (MAT), preoperative autologous blood donation, and preoperative normovolaemic haemodilution are three different methods to avoid homologous blood transfusion during surgical procedures.	1.1321727125798229
The controversial use of MAT via cell saver in tumour surgery as well as contamination of the operative field with urine illustrate the particular difficulties of autologous blood transfusion in connection with radical prostatectomy.	0.946703671482997
We investigated changes in the osmotic resistance of the retransfused red blood cells (RBC), bacterial contamination, changes in coagulation parameters, and the presence of tumour cells.	1.1385407347963485
Orbital pseudotumor is a nonspecific inflammatory process of unknown etiology that can be divided histopathologically into three basic types: granulomatous, lymphoid, and sclerosing.	1.1231134856260157
Between 1995 and 1998, 12 patients with pseudotumor orbitae were treated in the ENT Department of the University of Saarland.	0.9881946220117281
Histopathological examination showed granulomatous type of pseudotumor in six, lymphoid in three, and sclerosing in three patients.	1.1320905646107642
In seven cases the pseudotumor orbitae were medially located and in four cases laterally.	0.828568145331528
In one patient nearly all orbital structures were infiltrated.	0.8876800098315589
A number of different mapping systems have been published for the lymph-node staging in lung cancer.	0.9471556123400833
The use of a reproducible map is an essential prerequisite for correct determination of the TNM status and comparing the surgical results.	1.1462401924925674
In order to evaluate the current status of lymph-node mapping and lymph-node dissection in Germany, we performed a mail survey involving 90 hospitals performing operations for lung cancer.	1.01680260516868
Responses were obtained from 61 (67.7 %) hospitals.	1.202829474391852
Currently, the majority of the departments (43 %) use the German staging system (according to the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Thorax-, Herz- und Gefäßchirurgie/Pneumologie), 23 % lymph-node mapping according to Naruke, and 25 % an individual description of the resected lymph nodes.	1.3842610852693567
The number of resected lymph nodes is reported in 75 % of the departments, the quotient of involved/not involved lymph nodes in 33 %.	1.233205724542056
Mediastinal lymph-node sampling guided by the intraoperative aspect of lymph nodes is performed in 59 % of the departments.	1.2151841783452009
A systematic mediastinal "en-bloc" resection is accomplished in 41 %.	0.871798462026329
The results of this survey represent the current status of lymph-node mapping and lymphadenectomy in lung cancer in Germany and might be useful for the development of a uniform staging system.	1.1016810938010164
In a 4-year period two right-sided empyemas occurred following a total of 39 pneumonectomies for lung cancer.	1.0411990746462805
In another case pneumonectomy was performed for left-sided lung cancer with concomitant empyema as an emergency procedure in a patient referred from an outside hospital.	1.1335901563581976
Empyema was treated with repeated thoracoscopic debridements and intermittent lavage with polyvinylpyrrolidine-iodine solution and streptocinase/streptodornase.	0.7699071977189577
Three to seven thoracoscopies were required to sterilize the pleural cavity.	0.6821589224785906
After a median follow-up of 14 months all three patients are well and without any evidence of infection.	1.1371231930326249
VATS is suitable for definitive treatment of postpneumonectomy empyema and is associated with excellent functional and cosmetic results.	0.7906513146376087
Injuries to the spine and the spinal cord are an important problem.	0.9200588861176602
In the present paper the application of external transpedicular fixation of the spinal column for surgical treatment of patients in the acute phase of spinal cord injuries is described.	1.3623098644527263
The results of treatment obtained in 54 patients in the acute phase are presented.	1.0913992794487613
Decompression of the spinal cord can be accomplished by way of a dorsal approach.	0.8947979145757118
In this way it is possible to remove the compressing factor in stages.	1.182913090333047
Positive results were achieved in the late phase in 84.22% of patients with acute spinal and spinal cord injuries.	1.20189874994445
Objectives: Children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or non-hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) show retarded growth.	1.014931129847883
The question arose as to whether proportionate catch-up growth follows.	0.7754958421752269
Background: The fundus autofluorescence imaging technique has been modified allowing improved image resolution (768 x 572 pixel).	0.8750640145942765
We present results of fundus autofluorescence studies using this technique.	0.6891335716630308
Certain intra-articular fractures of the knee can be managed by arthroscopically assisted reduction and  fixation.	0.9380991920403411
The known benefits of arthroscopy include better visualization of the entire joint, limited dissection, and thorough irrigation.	1.0793982363924135
The purpose of this paper is to present our experience with arthroscopically assisted reduction and fixation of certain intra-articular fractures of the knee.	0.9891580998054483
From May 1995 to November 1997, 34 patients with intra-articular fractures of the knee were treated by arthroscopic reduction and fixation.	1.0763420318302577
We treated 11 patients with tibial plateau fracture type I, II and III (according to J. Schatzker classification), 20 patients with avulsion fracture of the tibial insertion of the anterior cruciate ligament (intercondylar eminence) type II, III and IV (according to Meyers, McKeever and Zariczny classification), two patients with completely dislocated osteochondral flake fractures of the femoral condyle, and one patient with a minimally displaced fracture of the patella.	1.1765518409813542
Postoperatively they were all allowed passive motion exercises.	0.7179518879522013
Patients with avulsion fractures of the ACL and the patient with fracture of the patella were allowed immediate weight bearing, while patients with tibial plateau fractures and osteochondral fractures were allowed weight bearing only after 12 weeks.	1.2171123778216977
Results: Of the 11 tibial plateau fractures, 8 were anatomically reduced, and in 2 the dislocation was less than 2 mm.	1.42796124576826
No further dislocation of the fragment followed.	0.8401180969042502
All patients but one reported stable knees and they all had a full range of motion at follow-up.	0.8209118554776492
Of the 20 patients with avulsion fracture of the anterior cruciate ligament, 19 were anatomically reduced.	0.8058445976259383
Except in one patient, functional results were excellent (KT1000 was 1.3 mm, average loss of flexion was 2.5 °, loss of extension was 1.3 °).	1.1916388316602144
In two cases of osteochondral fractures of the femoral condyle, reduction was anatomical.	1.302121700835569
The fractures healed, the patients were free of pain and had full ROM at the follow-up.	1.0531982580470405
The fracture of the patella healed in 4 weeks with full ROM of the knee.	0.9328912770742078
There was one case of aseptic synovitis and no other major complications.	1.1136611601201243
Conclusions: Arthroscopic reduction and fixation are technically possible in certain types of intra-articular fractures of the knee.	1.0082692538867517
Provided indications are good, results of arthroscopic treatment are better than in classical surgical treatment through arthrotomy.	1.0440433920969405
There is less postoperative morbidity, and hospitalization and total rehabilitation times are shorter.	1.0250646223054185
Some technical hints are presented.	0.5027320073650977
A healthy 38-year-old woman suffered a sudden cardiac arrest 2 days after a vaginal hysterectomy.	1.0717793407441802
Although standard cardiac life support (CPR) was instituted immediately after the event, it was not possible to re-establish a spontaneous circulation for about 40 min.	1.0657538916737277
Systemic intravenous thrombolytic therapy with slow injection of 1.5 million IU urokinase was performed as a final life-maintaining measure because of the high probability that the underlying cause was a pulmonary embolus; 10 min later (after 60 min of ongoing CPR) the patient regained a stable circulation.	1.3055238873460668
She survived without neurological deficit in spite of the long duration of CPR.	1.1876961478199632
In 348 patients with an initial diagnosis of rectal carcinoma operated on between 1985 and 1994 we investigated the quality of lymph node dissection, its influence on the perioperative risk and tumor staging.	1.2596259882730498
The same histopathological work-up was carried out in all cases.	1.0287009983462494
Whether resections or extirpations were performed, the number of dissected lymph nodes increased from 5.3 and (1985/1986) to 16.7 and 17.3 (1991/1992) and to 15.8 and 17.3 (1993/1994) respectively.	1.324020688738515
Neither the type of operation nor the surgeon's experience had a significant influence on the number of lymph nodes dissected.	0.937596882298874
The increase in the number of lymph nodes dissected had no negative effect on the length of the operation, the amount of blood infused during the operation or the perioperative risk.	1.0598262906015117
We found a significant correlation between the number of lymph nodes dissected and the number of lymph node metastases (P = 0.02) and between an increase in UICC stage III (P = 0.005) and pN2 tumors (P = 0.000) and an increase in the number of lymph nodes dissected.	1.1332507354881987
Central lymph node dissection by high ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery did not increase the perioperative risk in spite of the fact that in recent years we have observed more patients with multiple diseases.	1.2818073741622666
With the institution of the Protection against infection Act, case definitions will be officially introduced for the routine transmission of notifiable infectious diseases from local health departments to state and national health institutions in Germany for the first time.	0.889083492399661
Case definitions link the disease entity with a defined description of the disease.	0.8518559536629073
The abstraction thereby required leads to the creation of nosological entities.	0.700836081574717
The case definitions, which were developed by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) according to the Protection against infection Act, enable the local health departments to assess and categorise reported cases, deaths and laboratory reports of pathogens according to uniform criteria prior to transmission to the RKI via the state health institutions.The quality of surveillance data will be significantly improved, as each reported case/infection will fulfil defined criteria, thereby enabling unclear cases/diagnoses to be separated from those that are confirmed.	1.0535364068984172
Endosseous osseointegrated implants have become an integral part of the treatment scheme for the prosthetic reconstruction and rehabilitation of masticatory function following scientific studies of the reactions between implant and soft and hard tissues.	1.0505643968273133
Furthermore, implants offer good chances for prosthetic rehabilitation in the insufficient bone site, if the extremely atrophic jaw is to be reconstructed by grafting procedures with avascular and vascular grafts, by guided bone regeneration, by distraction osteogenesis, by bone substitutes and in the future by osteoinductive proteins in order to prepare the conditions for implant insertion.	1.2370299761115655
Those reconstruction procedures combined with implants become often necessary, if  complicated hard and soft tissue defects of the skull have to be reconstructed to create the prerequisites for the stabilisation of epitheses or to insert implant-supported devices.	1.0428866846622207
A 58-year-old woman was initially externally diagnosed in 1983 with a presacral mass, which was subsequently treated as an abcess.	1.149468252234901
Thereafter, the patient experienced recurrent perianal fistulas.	1.306567330944935
Further diagnostic studies revealed a cystic tumor, considered to be an epidermoid cyst, which was located in the inferior pelvis and was consequently removed.	1.1611252182743363
Histologically, cystic scar tissue was found with a highly differentiated adenocarcinoma which measured 4 cm.	1.0849701024676568
Later on, the patient again experienced perianal fistulas originating from a renewed presacral mass.	1.0609707864231948
As a result, an abdominal-perianal rectum extirpation and a partial resection of the sacrum with placement of a descendostomy were done.	0.9794447187628893
Histologically, adenocarcinoma tissue was found at the base of a tail-gut cyst.	1.0636984227622304
One year following her operation, the patient is free from any complaints and relapses.	1.187259236306979
The tail-gut cyst is a very rare entity which arises from the inadequate involution of the tail-gut during embryonal development.	0.8820722901694152
A malignant transformation occurs in 10 % of the cases.	0.8077463893412495
In the case of recurrent perianal fistulas and cystic masses between the rectum and os sacrum or os coccygeum, a tail-gut cyst should be taken into consideration, the goal being its complete removal.	1.0819606564768212
The German Social Law has required quality assurance (QA) procedures since 1989.	0.8946707878487993
The measures must be suitable to allow "comparing investigations".	0.8200828733894968
In 1992 the German Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine published recommendations for QA in anaesthesia: most problems during an anaesthetic should be documented in a standardised manner, and thus, a list of 63 pitfalls, events, and complications (PECs) and five degrees of severity were defined.	1.182319435976539
The goal of this study was to determine the frequency of PECs in anaesthesia and to correlate PECs with procedures and preoperative health status.	0.9324358261524511
Using the diary method, the correlation between daily mood and everyday activities is analyzed.	0.9045721915459922
Positive and negative affect were used as indicator of daily mood.	0.8089812792784677
Duration of social activities and resting during the day were used as indicator of daily activities.	0.8972162576387631
A total of 55 elderly persons kept a activity and mood diary for at least 50 days.	0.9228025191091235
The data were analyzed interindividually (using regression analyses) and intraindividually (using time series analyses).	1.1998595768289895
While positive affect and duration of social activities correlate positively in both inter- and intraindividual perspective, there is a relationship between negative affect and duration of rest only in interindividual perspective.	0.9922021101500769
Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.	1.0647573509777621
Purpose: Regional hyperthermia in combination with chemotherapy or/and radiotherapy is a promising treatment concept for locally advanced, deep-seated tumors.	1.1110873843958675
The purpose of the project is the optimization of the therapy using non-invasive, three-dimensional imaging of tissue changes or of the temperature distribution during regional hyperthermia.	1.160792034796399
The purpose of the Transfusion Law, which came into force on 7 July 1998, is to ensure the supply with safe blood products, to reinforce the confidence in the blood transfusion system, and to support self sufficiency with blood and plasma.	1.2482295117893099
In order to reach this goal, the law regulates the essential reqirements for the adequate collection of blood and blood constituents, as well for safe usage of blood products.	1.2037124875006544
Moreover it lays down rules for look-back procedures, prescribes the collection of data on the epidemiology in donor populations, creates a legal basis for the advisory group 'Arbeitskreis Blut', and fosters the self sufficiency with blood and plasma by several prescriptions.	0.9005461355491946
In the last decades back pain has reached dramatic proportions in industrialized countries.	0.9657539743785145
Disorders of the back are nowadays the leading cause of direct and indirect health care costs.	0.7706845832566832
Accurate prevalence estimates are needed to serve as a basis for health care evaluations.	0.8274616104391421
A review of epidemiologic studies in the general population reveals that back pain has reached a prevalence of 40 % for current pain.	1.2252334864189414
7 to 18 % are "frequently", "often", "daily" or "constantly" affected.	1.3628551586321471
75 % of the adult population suffers from back pain during the last year.	1.0642887008415283
80 to 90 % of the adult population in industrialized countries experience back pain ever.	1.038151562344607
Gender specific differences are only present in severe, chronic forms which are more often experienced by women.	1.0350367583029114
Back pain has a prevalence maximum at 50 to 64 years.	0.8655394267007166
Older persons display lower prevalence estimates.	0.5394721138472194
The prevalence maximum in men is one decade earlier than in women.	0.7882582115789857
There are several potential explanations for this prevalence pattern that are discussed in the article.	1.0202188728164432
Back pain can be classified by location, temporal characteristics, pain intensity and pain history.	0.9401986040386304
Currently, for none of these dimensions generally accepted, uniformly employed and validated definitions are available.	1.1417067182908798
In most of the industrialized countries back pain is one of the most expensive symptoms.	1.0490190571037432
75-90 % of the direct and indirect health care costs were caused by those 5-10 % of patients who are disabled.	1.2740228999689687
As predictors of back pain a history of back pain and job satisfaction play by far a more important role than the extensively studied mechanical factors.	0.885025892985997
For a first episode of back pain the prognosis is favorable.	0.8581533541897914
If the pain persist for more than three months the prognosis is unfavorable.	0.9906528137138817
After six months of absenteeism because of back pain more than half of the afflicted never return to work.	0.8352412269285814
Rarely back pain is present as a single symptom.	1.0123855076138608
In more than 80 % back pain is associated with pain in at least one joint.	1.1847882885647802
It remains to be studied if back pain may be viewed as an entity or as part of a more complex pain syndrome.	0.9957948198385833
Chronic low back pain can be considered to be one of the most frequently treated and most costly diseases in modern industrial societies.	0.9953400846173742
Dysfunctions and imbalances of the spine-supporting muscles increase the risk of low back pain.	0.8143704802701857
Consequently preventive treatment and rehabilitation have to aim at preserving and restoring the full capacity of the spine-supporting muscles as well as training coordination and spine-friendly behaviour.	0.9426757397327556
In addition to various measures of pain therapy, physiotherapeutic treatment including neuro-physiotherapy, physical treatment (eg electrotherapy), balneotherapy and supportive behavioural training, medical rehabilitation therapy (MRT) ranks among the most effective ways of treating low back pain.	1.1053450519611123
MRT applies guidelines and methods of exercise methodology within medically indicated programmes of preventive treatment and rehabilitation.	0.7975636728694133
Various objectives of MRT are outlined with special regard to the stages of MRT treatment, emphasizing positive adaptation of the neuro-muscular system in the course of rehabilitation.	0.9243189547535214
Physicians are responsible for MRT diagnosis and control.	0.7000699049946086
Taking into account the base disorder and the progress of therapy physiotherapists and the physicians in charge determine MRT objectives and treatment strategies.	0.9838420890361751
A 39-year-old female patient presented with an intense allergic reaction and shock after ingesting sunflower seeds and simultaneously acetylsalicylic acid (ASA).	0.7866395635247099
Skin tests and CAP specific.	0.5896699986521181
IgE demonstrated an IgE-mediated sensibilization to sunflower seeds.	0.6845192820594391
When sunflower seeds were eaten alone, only discrete paresthesias of the oral mucosa occurred.	0.99511387030646
Surprisingly, an oral challenge with ASA was well tolerated.	1.052814351323619
The supplementary centribution of ASA to the allergic reaction was done-dependent.	0.8245327361823733
The quantity of the allergen also modified the intensity of the symptoms.	0.8135972375441803
This surprising effect of ASA may be attributed to increased gastric resorption of the allergens.	0.8306322762358266
During the course of this reaction, eosinophil-cationic-protein was released.	0.764672078047858
Axillary lymph node dissection for node sampling is one of the most important staging procedures when mammary carcinoma is treated surgically.	0.9719364984062439
Periprosthetic femoral fractures present the problem of fracture treatment and prosthetic stability.	0.9541287212867885
Various treatment options are recommended for managing these fractures.	0.8509807784847379
We treated 51 patients with 54 periprosthetic fractures between 1985 and 1995.	0.7211450157328166
Of these, 42 (78 %) fractures were treated with a plate, eight (14 %), with a revision prosthesis, two (4 %), with retrograde nailing, and two (4 %), conservatively due to poor medical condition.	1.346111305324026
The choice of fracture management was dependent on the type and location of the fracture and on the stability of the prosthesis.	1.1903728882727456
A total of 50 fractures healed primarily.	0.9180288498194211
Complications included three cases of plate loosening, one further fracture, one deep infection, one broken bolt and one varus deformity.	1.118669465869231
Four patients died in the postoperative period, an additional 19 were dead at the time of the evaluation.	1.091236149928838
Fractures with a stable implant can be treated with plate fixation.	1.0199156978390322
Cases of a loose implant require revision.	0.787743718230099
Distal fractures are stabilized with a plate or with a retrograde nail.	0.9283256504874046
A young patient who underwent renewed aortic valve replacement after already open blasting of the aortic valve and following valve replacement with enlargement of the ascending thoracic aorty by using a pericardium patch had taken place is reported.	1.010222688554148
In the area of this enlargement by the pericardium patch, the development of an aneurysm was seen and was resected in the same setting without any difficulties.	1.1868934811634397
The particular items with special regard to the postoperative course are delineated in the following report.	1.1606095348304057
The situation of oncological surgery in Germany was evaluated by sending a questionnaire in January 1998 to 1979 registered surgical clinics.	0.9898440558593301
A total of 938 responded and stated that they are involved in that field.	0.942963896498933
In 72 % of the departments oncological surgery adds up to 10-30 % of their overall work.	1.2399101103352514
The proportion of oncological surgery correlated to hospital size and is highest in university clinics.	0.8441469476279759
Colorectal surgery is 93 % and is the leading topographical field in oncological surgery.	1.362623471726241
73 % of the hospitals regularly perform gastric tumor surgery.	1.1204694972670242
The proportion of hospitals with breast surgery is surprisingly high (45 %).	0.9549914864837411
Many hospitals (54.6 %) report neoadjuvant treatment regimens.	1.006923108682554
Together with adjuvant therapy this rate amounts to 85.2 %.	0.7294921115829116
The diagnostic spectrum of the hospitals involved in the inquiry is statisfactory.	1.0051783005382717
However, the modern possibilities of network and telecommunication are not sufficiently used.	1.0412770275358219
A second opinion is required predominantly in their own department or clinic, but not between centers.	1.1610395511580847
The surgeon's position concerning the speciality "surgical oncology" is ambivalent: only 35.3 % of the department chiefs support this speciality - and over 90 % of the departments reject the structural independence of "surgical oncology" from "visceral surgery".	1.147323209623368
Cryosurgery is a widely accepted modality for the treatment of capillary hemangiomas of the newborn.	1.0975531952827096
However, no studies clearly supporting its effectivity are available.	1.0962799103317697
A considerable number of patients with cardiovascular diseases suffer from advanced heart failure.	0.805202193480959
Actuarial 6-12 month survival of such patients is reduced to 50-75%.	0.9477587860021711
Since introduction of triple immunosuppression including cyclosporine, azathioprine and corticosteroids heart transplantation has been established as treatment of choice for patients with advanced heart failure refractory to medical treatment.	0.9936878513054128
However, the increasing imbalance between demand and supply of suitable donor organs limits the number of patients for this therapeutic option and requires a more restrictive listing of patients for heart transplantation.	1.2273365031024013
During the last few years promising new conservativ and alternativ surgical therapies have been developed.	1.0091021846193762
The conservativ medical therapy was improved by application of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and anticongestive betablockers.	0.762785386247791
Alternativ surgical therapies of advanced heart failure include high risk bypass surgery, high risk valve surgery, mechanical assist devices, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, partial left ventriculectomy, cardiomyoplasty and multisite-pacing.	0.9978147568451947
They serve as bridge to transplantation or medium- and long-term alternatives to heart transplantation.	0.8508815422439007
The therapeutic success is determined by adequate selection of patients for the respective therapy.	1.105922957066126
This requires the implementation of risk scores on the basis of national and international registries of patients with advanced heart failure.	0.8981623924982461
Motion analysis of the cervical spine is a sensitive tool in the fields of preventive and clinical biomechanics of whiplash.	0.9592576525021101
In the field of preventive biomechanics motion analysis contributes to validation and optimisation of dummy based crash test experiments and simulations.	0.7918379959275267
In the clinical field motion analysis up to now is of restricted value.	1.0710766364142197
Data exist about restrictions and pathologies of movement and motion of the cervical spine, coordinative disturbances, postural control, TMJ-function and oculomotor disturbances after whiplash.	0.8326276602483395
The standardisation of technical and clinical set-ups is necessary to establish a well proven biomechnical model of whiplash and whiplash related biomechanical dysfunction.	0.9606385531324324
Without this model the value of motion analysis for clinical use will be restricted due to lack of comparable data on sensitivity and specificity although motion analysis of the cervical spine is neither cost- nor time consuming and free of adverse effects.	1.021580044462885
Within a prospective series of 28 patients (14 m/ 14 f) with a follow-up to six weeks we were lucky to describe numerically two different types of reaction to low energy (v < 20 km/h) rear end collision: Type I with disturbances in complex movements only, Type II with overall restriction of movement.	1.1559016634215977
Control of angular velocity during cyclic movements of the head was disturbed by oscillations of higher frequency in all patients.	0.9393266684567846
Recovery from whiplash within 6 weeks could be monitored.	0.7510423207406384
Diagnosis of parasomnias in the sleep laboratory is difficult since the nocturnal behavior reported by the patients often does not show up in the laboratory.	0.9975466141120193
To test the efficacy of sleep deprivation as a tool to provoke somnambulism we investigated ten patients (three women and seven men, mean age 27 +/- 3.4) with somnambulism.	1.1301326505324323
Their standard polysomnographies and videomonitored nocturnal behavior was compared to that of sex- and age-matched controls and to polysomnography and behavior after sleep deprivation.	1.0007298121823858
Patients with parasomnias and controls did not show significant differences in sleep parameters with the exception of longer arousal duration in controls, which was nonsignificant.	1.2079682059635721
In magnetic resonance tomography, patients with parasomnias did not reveal abnormality of the brain that might explain release of nocturnal behavior.	1.1777027797964361
Sleep deprivation led to significantly reduced number of arousals, reduced arousal index, significantly prolonged arousal duration and more stage shifts from all sleep stages (nonsignificant).	1.0072457371497572
Complex behavior during sleep increased under sleep deprivation, whereas sleepwalking did not increase.	0.9754779198645332
The majority of complex behavior during sleep is triggered by stage shifts and not by arousal in the sense of the arousal definition of the American Sleep Disorder Society.	1.0822672784442888
Complex behavior in sleep is stereotypical and nonviolent.	0.6255134379595806
Its complexity seems to depend on the duration and intensity of arousals.	0.8540979745818847
Sleep deprivation can be recommended as an efficacious method of increasing complex behavior in sleep, which is a preliminary stage of sleepwalking.	1.1706978705496074
Concerning the underlying pathology it seems to be important to register the quality and duration of stimuli that trigger arousals instead of focusing the number of arousals alone.	1.0326143151947087
Introduction: In order to investigate whether operative technique determines the 5-year recurrence and survival rates, we analysed the results obtained by two surgical departments using two different operative techniques.	1.3008177936594854
Department A: Removal of the tumour and a number of lymph nodes; department B: En-bloc resection in accordance with the requirements of standardised tumour surgery.	0.9440372407328067
Patients and methods: The surgical results obtained with all patients with colorectal carcinoma operated on between 1984 and 1988 (department A: 152 colon and 53 rectal carcinomas; department B: 124 colon and 177 rectal carcinomas).	1.0267445378966398
Results: The local recurrence rate achieved by department A was signicantly higher (colon carcinoma: department A 25 %; department B 10 %; rectal carcinoma: department A 54 %; department B 16 %).	1.1735491895386019
The 5-year survival rate for colon carcinoma was 65 % in department A, and 66 % in department B, the corresponding figures for rectal carcinoma being 49 % and 72 %, respectively.	1.400623209846876
Conclusion: The results indicate that carcinoma of the colorectum should be operated on only at an institution that complies with the standards required for surgery of colorectal carcinoma.	1.183488697781305
Definition of the problem: Ethics consultation is one of the most important ways in which clinical ethicists can support both health-care providers and patients and their relatives in coping with ethical and existential challenges.	0.9745916191645111
The practice of ethics consultation, as performed at the Freiburg University Hospital is described and illustrated by a case report about the problem of treatment termination.	1.1320224605993288
The range of subject matters that come up in ethics consultations is analyzed.	0.818110655768466
A research program in clinical ethics is summarized that has been undertaken to pave the way for a specific and interdisciplinary analysis of needs; from there on, the investigation aims at further developing clinical ethics support services.	1.0235199615976838
Suggestions for criteria of competence for ethics consultants are formulated on the basis of both the author's and international work.	1.0318768763671216
Finally, the issues of structural conditions for establishing clinical ethics in the German-speaking world are raised and the long-term prospect of ethics consultation as an instrument for learning and teaching ethics in the health-care system is highlighted.	1.052053684667106
Objectives Bridging of an extensive bone defect with a long stem revision prosthesis anchored in the diaphysis to restore a pain free function of the limb.	1.017871294853503
A total of 205 patients suffering from stage I and stage II melanoma were investigated with reference to psychosocial stress, social support and attitude to offers of psychotherapeutic support.	1.0777425464860497
Additional counselling by their dermatologist was considered helpful by 59% of the patients, and interviews with a psychotherapist, by 20%.	1.10176606012257
Patients who where more anxious about a progression of the cancer and thought they had not been given sufficient information about their illness preferred to seek help from the dermatologist.	0.976609431225535
Patients who appreciated additional counselling by a psychotherapist were usually those with a poorer prognosis for their melanoma and those on whom psychosocial distress weighed especially heavily and who had less social support.	0.9668621391911756
The original structure of the synovial membrane is completely destroyed in the rheumatoid synovium and is characterized by mononuclear cell infiltration, synoviocyte proliferation, neo-vascularization, and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins.	0.8560615201716582
Adhesion molecules play an important role in the development of these pathologic changes.	0.7500217698426331
In this review we discuss the role of the adhesion receptors of the selectin, integrin and immunglobulin families and of the CD44 molecule in the cell-cell and cell-matrix interaction in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory changes in rheumatoid arthritis.	1.0056422035974812
During the last five years several authors have reported largely satisfactory results, using the steroid intravenous anaesthetic eltanolone (pregnanolone) for induction of anaesthesia after administering a bolus dose.	1.045255552463006
Until now, however, no investigations have been undertaken, dealing with the infusion pharmacokinetics of eltanolone after arterial blood sampling and using slow induction to quantify the concentration-effect relationship.	1.005671249817456
Secondary objectives were to assess the haemodynamic and respiratory effects.	0.8418192857906109
Background: Intraoperative measurements of local intracapillary hemoglobin oxygenation of the human cochlea via the round window membrane have been shown to be possible using the Erlangen microlight-guided spectrophotometer.	1.1576051048838285
The aim of the present study was to develop a new microlight guide suitable for measurements in the round window niche and to evaluate electrophysiologically the possible impact of the procedure on the cochlea.	1.0867510278308952
High-dose UVA1 therapy is an effective treatment of patients with acute atopic dermatitis.	1.2686578541325046
However, some patients do not respond well to this new therapy.	1.1391623206766741
We attempted to further characterize the non-responder population in a retrospective study.	0.9042311684174794
Two closely matched groups of responders (n=20) and non-responders (n=20) were compared.	0.9555145286174596
No significant differences were observed between both groups with respect to the following parameters: skin type, minimal erythema dose, single and cumulative doses of UVA1, and peripheral blood eosinophils.	1.2165304905454988
However, non-responders were characterized by a highly elevated atopic score, and by high levels of total IgE and of specific IgE.	1.3489941542024224
Furthermore, colonization of the skin with Staphylococcus aureus occured at higher densities, and intestinal growth of Candida albicans was more frequently observed.	1.2999178780451743
These data indicate that high-dose UVA1 irradiation is not effective in all patients suffering from atopic dermatitis.	1.1623761167077322
We conclude that non-responders with complicating infections might benefit from the combination of high-dose UVA1 therapy and antibiotic or antimycotic treatment.	1.0558792712803
Introduction: Many causes are given as  the main reason for inadequate pain therapy.	1.327999344024878
The objective of our study was to demonstrate the current position of doctors in general practice all over Austria who prescribe prescriptions.	0.9457100078073893
We report a woman with erythema palmare hereditarium, an anomaly not documented so far in the German literature.	1.1271760829081947
It is characterized by a bright erythema of the palms, usually persistent since birth.	0.911546472724944
It is transmitted in an autosomal-recessive mode and has a benign course.	0.9668078184283359
In our patient it was possible to trace the palmar erythema over three generations.	1.0143556440808694
The decline of STD in the region of Rostock, Germany, since 1945 is explained by a decreasing incidence of gonorrhoea and trichomoniasis.	0.9860387582154293
On the other hand chlamydial and candidal infections have increased.	0.9496424259599062
The rate of chlamydia infections was about 45% in our venerological patients, as common as gonorrhea used to be.	1.214496837036623
Genital candidal infections were to be found in 23%.	0.735842918486522
Mycoplasmas were identified in 15%, usually combined with other pathogens except in some cases of vaginitis.	1.2568894285658323
The role of radiotherapy in the treatment of Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has changed considerably in the last few decades.	1.0888039266226068
Clinical observation of mainly unicentric pathogenesis with continuous expansion and subclinical involvement of adjoining regions of lymph nodes has resulted in the introduction of a large-field technique with total nodal irradiation (TNI) or total lymphatic irradiation (TLI).	1.05113716843989
The introduction of polychemotherapy has led to further improvement in the cure rate and in considerations concerning using both methods and adapting them to the stage and risk.	1.0192494521986109
Today the combination of radiation and chemotherapy leads to a reduction in the amount of radiation required in the affected regions (involved field irradiation = IFI).	0.9684179227083098
The German Society of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery was founded by Martin Waßmund in 1951.	0.8452854886832597
One of the main reasons was the need for scientific representation in the council at a medical convention.	1.1385742927801539
The Society, originally composed of 52 members, was first called "The German Society of Maxillofacial Surgery".	1.0894164270826199
In 1972, it extended its title to include the term "oral" ("Mund") and currently comprises 620 members.	1.3309614488495485
A scientific conference is held annually on a specific topic.	0.7495647331214101
The lectures given there have been published since 1954 in "Fortschritte der Kiefer- und Gesichts-Chirurgie" (Progress in Maxillofacial Surgery) by Thieme Verlag; since 1997, they have appeared as a Springer-Verlag supplement.	1.0976656060408556
Topics of choice are published in "Mund,- Kiefer- und Gesichtschirurgie" ("Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery"), originally by Hanser in Munich and now by Springer-Verlag in Heidelberg.	1.262819541254525
In this manner, it was possible to completely document the scientific activities and progress in this specialty.	0.9953853506389294
Each year since 1957, a prize named after M. Waßmund, has been given for outstanding scientific accomplishment.	1.060115290941219
The presidents, convention locations, topics, and prizewinners are listed in a table.	0.9143629310606781
Since the founding of the Society of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, close cooperation has existed with the National Association of German Oral and Maxillary-Facial Surgeons (Bundesverband der Deutschen Ärzte für Mund-Kiefer-Gesichts-Chirurgie).	0.8625436583929103
In order to intertwine scientific and political interests, a fusion of these two organizations is planned for the year 2000.	1.1012579985125022
The hepatorenal syndrome is defined as the development of renal failure in patients with severe liver disease in the absence of any other identifiable cause of renal functional impairment.	1.155225855109897
The pathogenesis of this obviously functional renal failure is complex and not completely understood.	0.9660846902465879
Of importance seems to be a peripheral and systemic vasodilatation with redistribution of blood volume.	0.9981988727203894
Nitric oxide seems to play a major role as a possible primary mediator.	1.0211966691212566
As a consequence changes in several different pathophysiological mechanisms (sympathetic nervous system, renin-angiotensin system, vasopressin, endothelin, prostanoids, natriuretic peptides) lead to a functional renal impairment which is characterized by renal cortical vasoconstriction.	0.977582371927627
Supportive treatment and intensive monitoring of the cardiovascular circulation is the main goal in the care of these patients.	1.228189850683647
The mortality is still high exceeding 90%.	0.8790666619765206
Renal extracorporeal support should be initiated using a continuous method when recovery of liver function is expected (acute liver failure, waiting for liver transplantation).	0.9674398349143877
The only effective and permanent treatment is orthotopic liver transplantation.	0.8071468184931777
A 16 year old patient with the typical clinical signs of Albright's hereditary dystrophia developed series of epileptic seizures with loss of consciousness, tonic muscle contractions and bite of the tongue.	1.008234484182173
After termination of the seizures there was coma without focal neurological signs.	0.6584931586760016
CT scan revealed diffuse brain edema.	0.5314800476022356
Electroencephalographic studies showed generalized slowing.	0.6198127183425842
In laboratory tests the only abnormalities were marked hypocalcemia (1.15 mmol/l) and hyperphosphatemia.	1.1361076525988674
Blood parathyroid hormone (PTH) was elevated.	0.8649392115974641
PTH-Test confirmed the diagnosis of pseudohypoparathyroidism.	0.8424463935855789
The patient was treated with calcium and 1,25-dihydroxy-cholecalciferol.	1.091168319774902
After few days the severe encephalopathy, CT and electroencephalographic changes were completely reversible.	0.9729333816147546
Hereditary disturbances of the parathyroid hormone metabolism are rare diseases.	0.9731923879549244
Hypocalcemia must be included into the differential diagnosis of seizures and brain edema to avoid invasive diagnostic and irrational treatment.	0.9986811422804541
An adequate increase of uterine blood flow throughout gestation is essential for uterine, placental and fetal growth.	0.8372773980606695
Maternal cardiovascular adaptation has to provide the uterine perfusion that is necessary to meet the requirements of the developing and growing fetus by providing transport of nutrients and oxygen to the placenta and the fetus.	1.0419384129749616
Thus uterine blood flow is inextricably linked to fetal growth and survival.	0.8594911653142316
Reductions of uterine blood flow can occur under acute or chronic conditions or in a combination of both.	0.8754725947647679
Chronic reductions of uterine blood flow can be observed in pregnancy induced hyertension (PIH), diabetes mellitus in pregnancy and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).	0.9973451046279744
Chronic restrictions in uterine blood flow will elicit a placental and fetal response in the form of growth adaptation to the reduced supply of oxygen and nutrients to the conceptus.	0.9386951874284211
If compensatory growth restriction reaches its limits intrauterine fetal distress can ensue.	0.7320159115141263
In view of a possible Stent implantation, 20 infrarenal abdominal aneurysms obtained consecutively during postmortem examinations were investigated.	1.0563624880143954
Measurements were performed according to toporegional criteria on the proximal and distal necks of the aneurysms as well as on their lengths and diameters.	0.943372294926943
Then we correlated the extent of the proximal and distal necks to the aneurysmal lengths and diameters, respectively.	0.9484502680329456
The following results were obtained: 1.	0.8950892628414971
Depending on the increase in length of the infrarenal abdominal aneurysm, there is an inproportional shortening of the proximal and distal neck.	1.2246293201668
Up to an aneurysmal length of 4 cm both proximal and distant necks are suitable for stent fixation in all cases.	0.7898577027070304
With lengths of more than 4 cm according to the morphological results, the distal neck is almost always unsuitable for fixation of a simple Tube-Stent.	1.0745135687546807
The proximal neck is suitable for stent fixation in all cases up to an aneurysmal length of 10 cm.	0.8329999310684061
For longer aneurysms, only a quarter of all cases is suitable for stent implantation.	1.1011206060928709
In all cases investigated there were severe arteriosclerotic changes with atheromatous ulcerations and secondary wall-adherent thrombi of up to three centimeter thickness in the aneurysmal and para-aneurysmal regions.	0.9206279591552475
These findings have to be considered, with respect to the transluminal transport of the prosthesis as well as in the regions of the supposed implantation in the proximal and distal necks of the aneurysm with individually variable arteriosclerotic changes of the aorta.	1.1955786825943189
We report on a case of paraganglioma of the cauda equina in a 48-year-old man.	1.037657743191604
These slow-growing, mostly benign and encapsulated intradural-extramedullar tumours are clinically characterized by lumbago, paraesthesia and motor deficits as well as occasi-onally by incontinence.	0.8841161823054089
Paragangliomas of the cauda equina show monomorphous (main) cells arranged in a typical cell cluster pattern, demonstrating a lobular architecture and a fine net of connective tissue formed by so-called sustentacular cells; some tumours show focal ganglionic differentiation.	0.9024135308844488
Because of their morphological similarity to the more common ependymomas, paragangliomas of the cauda equina are sometimes misdiagnosed so that their incidence is likely to be higher than previously estimated.	0.9694657218330185
Immunohistochemistry findings are positive for neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin and other neuronal markers as well as neuropeptides (main cells) and S-100 protein (sustentacular cells) while widely lacking reactivity for GFAP.	1.0434021072900335
Paragangliomas of the cauda equina represent a rare entity, of which only 80 cases have been described in the literature.	1.0286970392385508
Because they only occur sporadically, they are often not included in the differential diagnosis of mass lesions of the region of the cauda equina.	1.0581484766655218
Approximately one out of every three patients with carcinoma of the cervix must be expected to experience a recurrence.	1.105781116632345
The treatment of such relapses is dependent on the site and extension of the recurrence, the type of primary therapy administered and the patient's general condition.	1.2571615247319994
The limit conditions for the application of the established forms of therapy available - surgical operation, radiotherapy, chemotherapy - are complex and seldom documented by randomized studies.	1.1952438120892135
In general, empiric observations and historical analyses determine the backdrop against which therapy is planned.	0.8069381512009024
The main experiences available are compiled in this paper to give a basis for individual treatment of patients with recurrences.	1.14886029186859
Post-traumatic pyogenic liver abscess is a rare disease.	0.9711414517154584
We present the case of a 38-year-old man with multilocular liver abscess and pleural empyema following blunt abdominal trauma.	0.9368217192836825
The patient had a prodrome lasting 3 months before presenting in our department.	0.8212928663836955
The therapy included partial hepatectomy and pleural drainage.	0.5872741868124033
Clinical signs, diagnosis and possible therapy are discussed in this case report.	1.2968597236528974
The dream of every hospital computer scientist is a completely computerized flow of information in his/her facility: admission, diagnosis, treatment, transfer, and discharge of patients.	0.9392747902511892
However, in developing such general hospital information systems, one runs into the following problems: (1) medical and administrative information systems form a very heterogeneous environment; (2) the structure of medical information is extremely complex, except for certain limited administrative data (admission, transfer, and discharge, for example) needed by the clinic administration.	1.1761634778293613
As a result it is nearly impossible to transfer medical information from one system to another without a loss of data.	1.0413912756264423
One cannot expect a universal solution to this problem within the next few years.	0.7952756407116516
Therefore we present a concept which, based on existing tools, allows communication between medical information systems.	1.1353323295524267
Shave excision of nevi is a technique still under debate.	0.6816953884995015
Speed, simplicity, and the fact that it provides excised material for histologic examination are contrasted with the lack of excision margins and a higher rate of nevus recurrences.	1.126093147651452
In this study, the pros and cons of shave excision were evaluated.	0.8578870315618325
The congenital dyserythropoietic anemias represent a group of rare inborn errors with ineffective erythropoiesis as the predominant mechanism of anemia.	0.7899301851949247
They are primarily classified into three types on the basis of characteristic abnormalities of the erythroblasts as shown by light and electron microscopy.	0.9100782433336353
There are distinct associated features such as pattern of heredity, cell kinetics and abnormalities of the cell membrane.	0.942217381130672
In addition, patients with apparent CDA of heterogenous phenotype are observed, that cannot be attributed to any of the three types.	1.2176488340054041
Recently variant genes have been localized to different regions on chromosome 15 or 22.	0.7953012742321925
Cases of CDA were reported from many ethnics, in particular in families of meditarranean origin.	1.0451627952235851
Many patients load iron necessitating iron depletion.	0.5634448076747661
Gallstones are a frequent complication and are observed in childhood or adolescence.	0.978820233495344
Therapeutic measures such as splenectomy, treatment by Interferon  or allogeneic bome marrow transplantation depend on the type and the severity of clinical expression, which shows large variations both within and between affected kindreds.	1.0658964489760245
Sarcopenia is a constant in aging.	0.7026607719569612
Observed over long periods, it can reach 1% per year.	1.199046046030399
But it is such a tenuous phenomenon that it cannot be observed over short periods at steady state.	0.8835256192107953
The aging phenomenon mainly hits fibers, Type II but on aged muscle thin, normal, and hypertrophic fibers cohabit with sclerosis and fat increases.	0.9556681325893271
Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is characterised by stage-dependent microangiopathy.	0.9512594724538005
With increasing severity there is a decrease in the number of skin capillaries and the oxygen partial pressure.	0.9250747986962372
The cutaneous vascular reserve, which is measured by laser-doppler fluxmetry, is reduced.	1.216904595681049
Cutaneous microangiopathy is one of the main causes of the trophic disturbances associated with CVI.	0.9477279078121927
Low frequency pulsed current improves cutaneous microcirculation and thus nutrition as well as accelerating the formation of granulation tissue.	0.805273003339637
In a open prospective pilot study, 15 patients suffering from CVI with persistent leg ulcers were treated with low frequency pulsed current (Dermapulse), which is thought to improve particularly the tissue microcirculation.	1.1751849859220118
The average age of the patients was 70.3 years and the average duration of ulceration was 79.1 months.	1.2977792906526104
The patients were treated over a period of 38 days.	1.182535009456224
With this treatmen, 2 ulcers healed completely and 13 showed a reduction of size of on average 63%.	0.9715627192874183
Capillary density increased by 43.5%, while transcutaneous oxygen partial pressure increased by 82.4%.	1.067017998514977
Electrostimulation is a treatment with few or no side effects.	0.9499780893347117
From 1986 to 1996, we implanted a total of 92 hip arthroplasties (86 cementless, 4 hybrid and 2 cemented) in 65 patients with rheumatoid arthritis.	1.1131300743681556
Of the 89 uncemented cups, 59 were threaded cups (Hofer-Imhof n = 45, Zweymüller n = 7, Mecring n = 5, PM n = 2) and 30 were hemispherical cups of the Harris Galante type I and II.	0.9998612213047253
87 stems were implanted without cement (Zweymüller SL n = 58, Uni n = 16, Schenker n = 9, Zweymüller I n = 4) and 5 with cement.	1.0720903121444247
One patient died postoperatively and three (4 implants) within the first year.	1.295429884603725
To date, one cup of each threaded type had to be revised because of loosening (revision rate approx.	1.0228359634043735
6.8 %); Up to now, three of 87 (approx.	1.1347816515764118
3.4 %) stem revisions (1 x Zweymüller I, 1 x Schenker, 1 x Zweymüller SL) have been undertaken.	1.4285697807255502
Ten patients with twelve hip arthroplasties did not return for follow-up; some of them had a poor general health status.	1.0882255844549542
The clinical and radiological results of the arthroplasties of 52 patients showed a Harris Hip Score averaging 72 after an average of 54 months (min.	1.1452275053077001
Ten patients had minor complaints in the hip region.	0.7803007721016797
79 % of the uncemented implants (70 out of 89 cups, 69 out of 87 stems) were assessed radiologically.	1.1827634499029513
Two threaded cups showed slight migration after cancellous bone grafting in the presence of acetabular protrusion that was present in a total of 13 hip joints.	0.9412428715752524
This subsided markedly after filling with cancellous bone and recentering of the hip joint.	0.7077737522489292
Homogeneous incorporation of the bone grafting und thus remodelling of the medial wall was achieved, with the bone graft exhibiting marked reduction.	1.2737851380850373
At final follow-up, approx.	0.7825373192948569
75 % of the cementless cups had complete bone ingrowth without any evidence of radiolucency (type I), approx.	1.0485583561473764

Abstract   The 5th edition of the TNM classification entails a number of changes concerning head and neck tumors.	0.9849845231625102
The division of stage IV tumors into three subcategories marks a significant expansion of the stage grouping procedure.	0.8150602888979981
Methods: In a retrospective study the clinical course of 3247 patients with head and neck carcinomas were comparatively evaluated according to the 4th and 5th editions of the new TNM classification.	1.142720826251445
In particular it was the aim of the study to test the prognostic relevance of the subdivision of stage IV especially in mucosal cancer.	0.9941033255151526
Results: In classifying the primary tumor the most extensive changes were noted for supraglottic and salivary gland tumors.	1.1313240929199901
On the basis of the 4th edition of the TNM classification the following recurrence-free 5-year survival rates for 3033 cases of mucosal cancer were calculated: stage I 91,0%, stage II 78,6%, stage III 61,4%, stage IV 31,0%.	1.152748206264477
The calculations based on the 5th edition yielded: stage I 91,0%, stage II 77,2%, stage III 61,2%, stage IVA 32,4%, stage IVB 25,3%, stage IVC 3,6%.	1.2845699855194674
Conclusions: The adequacy of the revised stage classification in establishing a prognostic hierarchy was confirmed.	0.9021446840685786
However, a significant prognostic distinction between N2- (stage IVA) and N3-metastasis (stage IVB) could not be found.	1.4720992479182364
The microcirculation is the organ that provides the direct link between blood and tissue, and thereby between the whole organism and the single cell.	1.1132285001806923
Modern microcirculation research in experimental surgery is characterized by the use of high-resolution video fluorescence microscopy and quantitative computer-assisted image analysis coupled with the techniques of molecular biology and transgenic or knock-out gene technology.	0.9842086939119377
These advances should improve knowledge about surgically relevant physiologic and pathophysiologic phenomena at the interface between blood and tissues and help us to understand the initial molecular mechanisms leading to organ dysfunction following inflammation, ischemia-reperfusion, and transplantation.	0.9678099594656273
Legal and moral considerations hinder the introduction of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in Germany.	0.9064890035024923
This article presents and discusses the ethical arguments for and against PGD.	0.9199084422203525
In the autor's view neither the fact that PGD is not a well established technique nor the danger that single-cell-analysis may lead to misdiagnosis convincingly demonstrates that PGD is morally inacceptable.	1.01186661802346
Inconsistencies in ethical positions which defend abortions but do not accept PGD are highlighted.	0.6812674020559083
The use of arguments dealing with the prediction of negative social consequences after establishing PGD is criticised.	0.8011032946946596
Extensive counselling prior to PGD should be implemented in order to help couples which want to use the new technique to make an autonomous decision.	0.9831400559012355
The SOFA score, a new system for patients with sepsis-related diseases, was introduced in 1994 by the "Working Group on Sepsis-Related Problems of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine."	1.2080350543448488
The purpose of this study was to compare the new SOFA score with the APACHE II and MOD scores.	0.7931637632205718
The data on 874 patients from a surgical intensive care unit in an university hospital were analyzed using commercially available software (SPSS for Windows, Version 7.5.2 and MS Excel '97).	1.1151544460137492
To compare the different scores, receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) - analyses were applied.	1.0002979308222921
The study demonstrated a clear correlation between an elevated SOFA score and the mortality of the patients during their ICU stay (score 0 -> mortality 0 %, 1 -> 3.6 %, 2 -> 22.5 %, 3 -> 86,7 %, respectively r = 0.445; P = 0,01).	1.4039024413648085
The ROC analyses of the APACHE II, the MOD and the SOFA scores were comparable (area under the curve: APACHE II 0.73, MOD 0.77, SOFA 0.71).	0.9275647957112734
In conclusion, the SOFA score is reliable and might be useful in the daily routine of an intensive care unit.	1.015478437267463
In individual patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), established prognostic factors do not satisfactorily predict clinical outcome.	0.991679803434023
For the first time we investigated a total of 100 HNSCC by Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) to define chromosomal alterations that are associated with the patients prognosis.	1.1748062091150935
Patients were followed for at latest 4 but at least 2 years after surgery or until death.	1.1064043480421994
During this observation period twenty-nine of them died because of cancer disease.	1.0624397950593822
The Kaplan-Meier method was used plotting survival curves for every single chromosomal alteration as well as every clinico-pathological parameter.	0.8423955350617388
The curves were tested for significance by the log rank as well as the Breslow test.	1.0986816666924146
Significance of particular prognostic parameters was then evaluated by the Cox regression model.	0.8581729908197333
The overall survival time as well as the recurrence free survival time were significantly lower in patients who's tumors showed amplifications of the chromosomal region 11q13 (p=0.0008 for LR and p=0.0024 for B).	1.078878184092184
The survival time of the patients was also lower if the carcinomas carried overrepresentations of chromosome 3q (p=0.0299 for LR and p=0.0546 for B).	1.032525010292641
Multivariate analysis (Cox's proportional hazards model) revealed both alterations as most important independent prognostic factors in HNSCC.	0.9310488248873875
None of the conventional clinico-pathological parameters (pT-, pN-status, UICC stage, grading) achieved statistical significance in the multivariate model.	1.1223382207888397
These results suggest that in HNSCC the occurence of 11q13 amplification and 3q overrepresentation are highly significant independent prognostic markers and of better value than the established TNM and grading criteria.	0.9227580161773319
We report a coincidence of balloon cell melanoma and balloon cell transformation in a dermal nevus of a 56 years old female patient.	1.2515550112272578
The foamy cells in both tumors with different dignity expressed S-100 and Vimentin.	0.9812361500141595
HMB45 was expressed in all balloon cells of the melanoma.	0.8848093530954142
Detection of HMB45 in some of the nevus-associated balloon cells was considered as an expression of cellular activation.	0.9010787617006782
We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of a malignant, primary plaque-type blue naevus in a 61-year-old male.	1.1689244618535108
Two biopsy specimens had been examined within 13 years, and revealed a common and cellular blue variant as a precursor.	1.0484877350807944
Locally invasive growth and regional lymph node swelling were present, but these alone could not confirm malignancy before evaluation of all clinical and histopathological features, as they are known to occur with benign cellular blue naevi.	1.2003277746992211
The recent literature and our case indicate that there is a malignant potential in every histological and clinical variant of blue naevus.	1.0772210093563457
It is difficult to provide valid data with regard to changes in incidence and prevalence of acute pancreatitis in Germany.	0.9198339329571174
The lack of information is due to strict legal regulations to protect personal data, a certain lack of interest in epidemiological research and the lack of exact statistics of diseases treated in hospitals.	1.0444208689901628
The incidence of acute pancreatitis in other industrialized Western countries is about 10 new cases per year and 100,000 inhabitants.	0.9785659460761545
The increase of alcohol consumption over the last 30 years is associated with an increase of ethanol-induced pancreatitis.	1.0932022710065017
One may speculate that due to improved diagnostic possibilities, such as CT scan, cases where acute pancreatitis is diagnosed at autopsy are rare.	1.0028008034294074
Due to the increase in alcohol consumption it can be assume that the incidence and prevalence of chronic pancreatitis have increased in Germany similar to well-documented data from Denmark.	1.191092320019482
Since alcohol consumption is slightly decreasing in Germany it is likely that the present incidence of about 10 cases of chronic pancreatitis per 100,000 inhabitants will also decrease.	1.085544828924697
Process-Experiential (PE) therapy is a neo-humanistic treatment that strives to maintain a creative tension between a client-centered emphasis on a genuine, estecming, empathic relationship and the active, task-focused process-directive style of Gestalt therapie.	0.5338090966963029
This form of treatment is scientifically validated (Grawe 1997).	0.7685588396244816
Its theory of function and dysfunction has been updated via contributions from contemporary psychological theory.	0.3499117596910416
It incorporates a set of key therapeutic tasks, each of which is characterized by specific client marker and resolution state, series of steps clients pass through on their way to resolution, and therapist interventions used to facilitate client progress through those steps.	0.5168164423549803
This second part of the review provides an overview of specific therapeutic tasks.	0.8170130070725798
At last suggestions for practical implementation are discussed, and available outcome data is summarized.	0.9251887240019036
The human arterial blood pressure shows not only exogenic alterations, but also spontaneous fluctuations.	1.081572663208976
This blood pressure variability has both scientific and clinical relevance.	0.9448362295777385
A well-known phenomenon is the so-called "white coat hyptertension" which may severely affect diagnosis and therapy of essential hypertension.	1.0403978996049603
Furthermore, several studies have provided evidence that the degree of end-organ damage in hypertensive patients is closely related to the circardian blood pressure variability.	1.2457418887311205
Therefore, it is tempting to suggest that an optimal antihypertensive treatment should take an improvement of the blood pressure variability into consideration.	1.2978579969443336
The faeces sign is a recently described computed tomography (CT) feature of small-bowel obstruction and is seen as a mottled, faeces-like content within the lumen of the dilated loops above the level of the obstacle.	0.9713584339230433
To evaluate its prevalence, significance, and diagnostic value we retrospectively reviewed 94 consecutive cases of small-intestine obstruction studied with CT in the last 6 years.	1.0905992907390842
The faeces sign was recognizable in 7 cases (7.4 %) and was localized within ileal loops in all these subjects.	1.1060001966413568
In 6 of the 7 cases there was a simple and progressive obstruction, while there was a sudden onset with intestinal strangulation in only 1.	1.1890580048898165
The faeces sign is due to the intraluminal stagnation of enteric material and is generally recognizable in subjects with subacute obstruction.	0.8802185239251902
In our experience it is relatively uncommon.	0.7568736418425434
Nevertheless, it seems to be rather specific and may be a valuable accessory feature in the CT study of small-bowel obstruction.	1.3438342366627252
A case report is presented to illustrate the cutaneous manifestations in essential thrombocythaemia.	1.0724818794541788
Knowledge of the related skin lesions may lead to earlier detection of this myeloproliferative disorder.	0.8920223508983084
Treatment may prevent severe haemorrhagic or thrombotic complications.	0.6597624596743273
Erythromelalgia is causally related to thrombocythaemia; prompt relief of painful symptoms after treatment with aspirin is typical.	0.8768256941836621
Surgical treatment of proximal aortic disease traditionally consists of composite replacement of valve and aorta.	0.8415245622237292
Recent reconstructive procedures on the aortic root allow for treatment of aortic dilatation and concomitant aortic valve regurgitation without the associated disadvanteages of mechanical heart valves.	0.918284235900379
Two psychotic patients developed hyperglycaemia several weeks after starting olanzapine.	0.7697933218311737
In one case the elevated glucose concentrations returned to normal soon after withdrawal of olanzapine.	0.9410009474390622
In the second case severe ketoacidosis with letal outcome occured.	0.8240638782090819
Profilometry is a novel procedure allowing precise analysis of skin surface structure.	0.9098428615730854
With the help of a synthetic material a negative image of a defined area of the skin is taken.	1.1962122134369528
During the subsequent analytical procedure the roughness is determined by means of a profilometer.	0.9364054968884197
A commercially available statistics software program is used for statistical analysis of the results.	0.8810481084743386
This procedure was applied to check for to evaluate positive effects of oestrogen creams on the structure of the skin surface on the face.	1.1281691826342608
This article describes the historic roots of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) from the first experiments at 1800 until the introduction into the pharmaceutical market in 1899.	0.9345733994855959
In 1869, Hermann Kolbe enlightened the chemical structure of salicylic acid, which was used at that time as an analgetic and antipyretic drug.	0.9135993156838259
Because of the side effects, for example the irritation of the stomach, analytical chemists and pharmacologists searched for chemical modifications.	0.9357458986106728
In August 1897 Felix Hoffmann (1868-1946) was successful in acetylizing the salicylic acid to acetylsalicyl acid (ASA).	0.8217602768629307
Between 1897 and 1899 Kurt Witthauer (1865-1911) collected clinical data and experiences on the efficiency of ASA as an analgetic and antipyretic drug.	0.7794315012061561
In 1899 ASA was introduced into the pharamaceutical market as Aspirin and became soon one of the most successful drugs of its time.	0.994133219152144
The indication exceeds analgesia in the mean time and to prophylaxis of myocardial ischaemia or cerebral stroke, among others.	1.033791054904019
Background: The results of the Cryo-ROP group showed that cryotherapy significantly reduces the rate of adverse morphological and functional outcome of eyes with threshold retinopathy of prematurity.	1.0295237834603996
Structural status and visual acuity of 48 eyes which consecutively underwent cryocoagulation in our hospital between 1990 and 1994 were examined at 2 years corrected gestational age.	1.0315154891107166
Despite wide-spread immunisation programs epidemic influenza continues to cause ten thousands of deaths worldwide, every year, especially in the high risk groups of elderly or immunocompromised persons.	0.9869247450823063
At present, amantadine and rimantadine are the only approved agents available for prophylactic and therapeutic use, yet, the deployment of these substances is problematic: neither of the two drugs is effective against influenza B, their use is accompanied by rapid development of viral resistance, and they show many adverse effects.	1.1647074840428002
In contrast, zanamivir and GS4071/GS4104 are rationally developed influenza-specific neuraminidase inhibitors, proving prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy against influenza A and B, as well in vitro as in animal models, and in experimental human studies.	1.1523676483189724
Zanamivir and GS4071/GS4104 are well tolerated without adverse reactions after topic and oral administration, respectively.	0.7576587031437404
Resistant viral strains have been found in cell culture in the presence of both drugs, but the frequency of resistance emergence during clinical use is unclear.	1.2206502815213143
To date, the biggest recognizable disadvantage of neuraminidase inhibitors and Amantadin/Rimantadin alike is that they need to be given within 30-48 h after onset of symptoms, but seeking medical attention at this stage of infection does not seem to be realistic in medical practice.	0.9325470095301859
As neuraminidase inhibitors up to now could mainly be assessed by experimental data, specifically performed clinical trials will have to prove the positive influence of these drugs on the morbidity, course of infection, and mortality of high risk persons when administered for prophylaxis as well as for therapy.	1.1582770922144683
Background and purpose: Without recanalisation, acute basilar artery (BA) occlusion has a mortality of 90 %, which is reduced to 50 % if recanalisation is achieved.	1.2609785034193384
Fast diagnosis of BA occlusion is necessary in order to start thrombolytic therapy without delay.	0.8298507223080616
We wanted to assess the role of CT angiography (CTA) in the diagnostic evaluation of suspected acute BA occlusion.	1.2043313145703258
25 patients with coronary heart disease (CHD, 62  +/-  9 years) and 18 subjects free from cardiovascular disease (28  +/-  9 years) were tested on a cycle ergometer using a graded incremental test protocol: a) in the common upright position, b) as dynamic stress echocardiography in a semi-supine position.	1.1413300553883263
Whereas no relevant differences could be detected between the two conditions for the healthy subjects concerning heart rate, blood pressure, and rate-pressure product (2 x 3 ANOVA, t-test with -adjustment), the CHD patients showed both significantly higher heart rates as well as a significantly higher rate-pressure product (50 W: 15 300  +/-  2973 mmHg/min vs. 13 822  +/-  3042 mmHg/min; 75 W: 18 028  +/-  3479 mmHg/min vs 16 337  +/-  2619 mmHg/min) on equivalent stages during stress echocardiography if compared to the sitting position.	1.1573981524997026
There were no differences for systolic blood pressure in this group; the diastolic values were higher in the sitting position at rest and during 50 W. Lactate concentrations (determined only in the healthy subjects) were significantly higher on all stages during dynamic stress echocardiography.	1.201177724466699
The workload at the individual anaerobic threshold (IAT) was significantly lower.	1.126967313204372
A new stoechiometric mixture of 27% dicalcium-phosphate (DCPA) and 73% tetra-calcium-phosphate (TTCP) can be prepared with water intraoperatively to a paste that subsequently sets to a structurally stabile implant composed of hydroxyapatite (HA).	0.9220696976486087
Primary setting time is about 20 min; pH during setting ranges from 6.5 to 8.5.	1.1069005822017404
There is no relevant curing heat or expansion or contraction.	0.8213924476150667
Compressive strength is about 50 MPa, tensile strength about 8 MPa.	0.7869884536523086
Over a period of about 4 h in physiological milieu, the cement converts to hydroxyapatite.	1.0201779176650811
This product is no longer redissolvable  in normal body fluid.	0.886831595222239
This cement can be used for non-load-bearing applications especially in craniofacial bone surgery.	0.8719794869608797
Cranial defects due to tumour or trauma as well as deficits in the facial skeleton may be reconstructed using this new biomaterial.	0.9792224895114682
In nine of ten patients we used the hydroxyapatite cement successfully for reconstructions in the craniofacial area.	0.8892890359495385
Fluid control of the operation field and implant site is extremely important and sometimes difficult to achieve.	1.0659729050356601
Further applications could be all non-load-bearing augmentations such as filling of blocked paranasal sinuses, of dentoalveolar cysts and defects following dental apectomy or fixation of implanted hearing-aid electrodes.	0.8532724254174745
The perspectives for the hydroxyapatite cement include its application as a carrier for osteogenic protein preparations, especially because of its isothermic reaction and intrinsic osteoconductive characteristics.	0.9747273127555317
We present a non-invasive epilepsy surgery protocol, which includes EEG-video-monitoring, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), interictal positron emission tomography (PET) and ictal single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT).	1.0260724365627634
According to this non-invasive protocol 50 of 173 patients with medically intractable focal epilepsy underwent resective surgery.	0.8836826266898035
The localization of the epileptogenic zone was based on the congruence of the localizing results of EEG-video-montoring, MRI, interictal PET and ictal SPECT.	0.9019856088318379
46 (92%) of the patients had temporal and 4 (8%) had extratemporal epilepsies.	1.2833042673066102
78% (n=39) of all patients operated according to our non-invasive protocol were postoperatively completely or almost seizure free.	1.2373859092086097
Extramesiotemporal resections could be carried out without invasive EEG-recording if the epileptogenic zone was not adjacent to the eloquent cortex.	0.8046955904800157
We conclude from our results that in a considerable number of patients with medically intractable particularly temporal focal epilepsies, resective epilepsy surgery can be based on non-invasive EEG-evaluations and the risk of invasive recordings can be avoided.	1.0123911593539243
Necrolytic migratory erythema (NME) is mostly associated with a pancreatic-A-cell-glucagonoma and is considered to be a well-defined cutaneous paraneoplastic syndrome.	1.142495169201952
We report on a 74-year old female who atypically developed a NME after surgical treatment of a rectal adenocarcinoma.	1.2301630180110914
Continuous staging and laboratory investigation over four years gave no evidence of any metastasis or further neoplasia.	0.9427510164903686
Hair samples and perspiration collected from long term drug addicts (n = 18) under constant methadone treatment were investigated.	0.9593979020265672
Hair segments representing the individual hair growth of 4 weeks were analyzed for methadone, opiates and cocaine by GC/MS.	0.9416287765313074
The results obtained from the transdermal collection devices confirmed the presence of drug substances in variable amounts on the skin surface, methadone being the main analyte.	1.1225492409198399
The perspiration test period lasted for 4 days.	0.7239052569716472
For six persons illicit drugs similar to those in the corresponding hair samples were found.	0.8349730598713092
Overall, a poor relationship (r = 0,602) was found between the methadone dose under steady state conditions and the methadone level in hair.	1.2583007406774638
The results are discussed in the light of pharmacokinetic aspects, drug uptake by perspiration and forensic interpretation.	1.0887986864459562
Bilateral carotid artery dissection is a rare and unusual complication of blunt cervicofacial trauma.	0.9565181900245153
The diagnosis of a carotid injury is rarely suspected in trauma patients with neurological deficits.	1.0581165448746077
Neurological symptoms may develop in a delayed fashion.	0.8186479652775547
Angiography should be considered in trauma patients with hemiplegia and a normal mental status and in patients with blunt cervical trauma with an abnormal neurological examination.	1.186403766278726
Initial heparinisation can prevent arterial thrombosis and neurological deterioration.	0.7673045607170091
The authors report their findings which are based on 10 years of interdisciplinary cooperation in the treatment of chronic pain patients.	1.1063825547319295
They point out the practical use of their findings in daily practice.	0.8911173902803926
Abdominal compartment syndrome is defined by increased intraabdominal pressure above 20 mmHg with increased pulmonary peak pressure and oliguria.	0.9299142319316884
In primary abdominal compartment syndrome the increased intraabdominal pressure is caused directly by peritonitis, ileus or abdominal and pelvic trauma.	0.8969173371378966
Secondary compartment syndrome is a result of forced closure of the abdominal wall after abdominal surgery.	0.9704050901813711
The effects are decreased cardiac output, pulmonary atelectasis, oliguria to anuria and hepatic as well as intestinal reduction of perfusion.	0.9536818876115568
Effective monitoring is done by standardised measuring of urinary bladder pressure.	0.8488413264476987
Normal values are between 0 and 7 cm H2O, after elective laparotomies 5-12 cm H20.	1.1048632767571331
Above 25 cm H20 they are definitely pathological.	0.7285292156851302
For the prevention and therapy of manifested abdominal compartment syndrome the application of a laparostomy using a resorbable mesh is recommended.	1.0552127570594874
Between 1988 and 1999 we applied a laparostomy to lower the intraabdominal pressure in 377 patients.	0.9355727706422
In 16 % of the cases it was indicated by primary abdominal compartment syndrome with a bladder pressure of 31  +/-  4 cm H20 preoperatively, which could be lowered to 17  +/-  4 cm H20 by laparostomy.	1.1383393979427872
An early reconstruction of the abdominal wall could be performed in 18 % of the cases.	1.1339081987502797
Conclusions: The abdominal compartment syndrome is an often underestimated problem in abdominal surgery involving multiple organ systems.	1.0040386729282975
The temporary laparostomy lowering intraabdominal pressure rather than a forced closure of the abdominal wall should be used in all circumstances.	0.9900474693579011
In general, assessment of the correct placement of a central venous catheter is performed by fluoroscopy or by postinsertional chest X-ray.	0.8969613980215925
We report a case of intraaortic malposition of a central venous catheter in a 59-year-old male patient that was not detectable in chest films.	0.9888536536858293
Further exploration of this patient revealed a left-sided superior vena cava.	0.8049035137662729
Definition of the problem: In 1997, Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) was performed in 138.001 cases in Germany.	0.9707288701662229
The standard indications, single vessel disease and badly controlled angina, are more and more extended to multivessel disease with and without severe angina, unstable or preinfarction angina, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) itself.	0.9778039143080128
Dilating asymptomatic stenoses of more than 70-80% is a widely used indication, intending prophylaxis of complete occlusion and AMI.	1.1284123878459307
Actually there is no generally accepted guideline for the different new indications, conservative versus invasive treatment schedule.	0.9764442758246135
It is difficult for the patient to get appropriate information before his decision between mechanical procedures and conservative methods; authentic informed consent actually seems to be in a very bad position.	1.153375571157228
In 1992 the working group called "Arbeitsgemeinschaft leitender kardiologischer Krankenhausärzte (ALKK)" decided to start a registry of all PTCA procedures, in order to gain knowledge about the present status of PTCA in Germany.	1.0517226440536396
Up to March 1999, 198.608 PTCA are logged.	0.6586199024218756
Two children developed multiple melanocytic naevi after polychemotherapy administered for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in one and for non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the other.	0.9837089700678079
Induction of naevi does not seem to be related to specific agents used in chemotherapy, but rather to the immunosuppression resulting from multiple-agent chemotherapy.	0.9323319586788469
There are reports in the literature of both intrinsically and iatrogenically immunosuppressed patients who have developed multiple melanocytic naevi.	1.0290757062604556
Many small randomized studies with <beta>-blockers in patients with chronic heart failure have been published in recent years.	0.9321159796892284
A large meta-analysis by Lechat combining 18 studies with 3023 patients showed a 32% reduction in mortality in patients treated with <beta>-blockers.	0.8391787317786323
Mortality and hospitalization together were reduced by 37%.	0.7297527103222005
In 1998 two large randomized trials investigating Bisoprolol (CIBIS II) and Metoprolol (MERIT-HF) were finished.	0.9924263381390935
Both studies show a significant reduction in mortality in patients treated with <beta>-blockers.	0.7574281237943465
The ongoing COMET study compares <beta>1-selective blockers like metoprolol with vasodilatative <beta>-blockers like carvedilol in patients with chronic heart failure.	0.9169566874454183
Large clinical registries demonstrate clinical practicability of <beta>-blocker treatment of patients with chronic heart failure.	0.8676738743088243
All patients with stabel chronic heart failure ought to be treated with <beta>-blockers additional to a basic therapy with ACE inhibitors, diuretics, and digitalis.	1.016227907268648
The <beta>-blocker therapy regimen is to start with low doses and to increase the dose carefully:"Start low and go slow".	0.9537781324868347
Purpose: Cardiac imaging includes determination of the size and structure of the cardiac chambers, valves, great vessels and the coronary arteries, chamber and valvular function, myocardial perfusion, viability and metabolism.	1.1005102274761656
A 52-year-old patient presenting with severe thoracic pain of more than 30 minutes duration and ST-segment elevation > 1 mV in leads V1-3 was given 100 mg rt-PA. With persisting thoracic pain and ST-segment elevation, coronary angiography was performed 90 minutes after administration of thrombolytic therapy.	1.0740013598042275
Surprisingly, angiography revealed normal coronary arteries in presence of marked hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.	1.0544279404776953
New onset of thoracic pain after four hours led to chest raiograph demonstrating increased mediastinal widening and new pleural effusion as compared to a baseline chest film prior to rt-PA. Spiral computed tomography revealed overt Type B aortic dissection with an intimal flap and communication distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery with signs of a mediastinal hematoma.	1.0272532045685898
Immediate cardiac surgery with replacement of the dissected aortic segment was successfully performed.	0.8057119426667765
A literature review revealed 4% of aortic dissection to present with electrocardiographic signs of acute myocardial infarction and 13% to have concomitant coronary artery disease; moreover 34 cases of aortic dissection were misdiagnosed as infarction and subjected to thrombolytic agents with a mortality of 64% underlining the importance of exclusion of dissection prior to thombolytic therapy.	1.119673679461439
Between 1984 and 1996 we performed a Mason gastroplasty for the treatment of morbid obesity: 14 patients (average age 40 (26-48) years, body mass index (BMI) 48 (37-71) kg/m2, excessive body weight 67 (41-116) kg).	1.0237731974563968
Since the end of 1996 we now apply adjustable laparoscopic gastric banding (lab band): 73 patients (average age 39 (22-64) years, BMI 45 (32-69) kg/m2, excessive body weight 66 (41-116) kg).	1.0258827838336697
We compared the early and late results of both methods.	0.9351971287599813
Early results: no relevant morbidity or mortality for neither method.	1.0783333473218217
Late/intermediate results: reoperation rate for both methods 15 %.	1.1044166588656987
After an average of 3.7 years the excessive body weight loss (EWL) for gastroplasty was 54 (22-96) %.	1.2356329680774176
The EWL after lab band for 24 patients after 12 months was 47 (11-127) % and for 8 patients after 18 months 51 (28-139) %.	1.357709960874028
Since the introduction of the lap band the number of bariatric operations has greatly increased.	0.8097009719289916
Nevertheless, the perioperative complication rate has remained low, and the long-term outcome is similar for both methods.	1.3635773767636203
We investigated the relationships between prolactin (PRL) levels and antibody occurrence in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).	0.8117815797272759
No significant association between PRL levels and the majority of the autoantibodies studied (anti-U1 RNP, anti-rRNP, anti-Sm, anti-dsDNA, anti-DNP, auto-LCA, anti-EACA) could be confirmed (P > 0.05), anti-Ro/SSA antibodies being an exception.	1.1243001823488366
Our results showed significantly increased frequencies of these antibodies in the group of female SLE patients with normal PRL levels (< 20 µg/L): anti Ro/SSA in 53% (P < 0.025, 2 = 5.80, RR = 4.0) and anti-Ro/SSA + anti-Ro/La in 60% (P < 0.05, 2 = 4.05) compared with female SLE patients with hyperprolactinemia.	1.131869668579871
An echinococcal cyst of the heart is a rare cause of acute cardiac tamponade.	1.015050819771109
We report on a 24 year old male from the Kosovo who was brought in an emergency state from a provincial hospital complaining of severe dyspnea, thoracic pain, dizziness, and a short period of unconsciousness.	1.2168081204081538
Surgical decompression had to be performed urgently, because the pericardium could not be punctuated due to the position of the hydatid cyst.	1.0956541111509057
We report on the case of a 51-year-old female patient who had been suffering from multiple itching nodules for 3 years.	1.071398628232959
Some of these lesions were classified clinically and histologically as keratoacanthomas (KA), whereas the multiple smaller nodules were found on histological examination to be either early stage KA or lesions of prurigo simplex subacuta.	1.1929341584904996
In two KA, HPV subtype 2 was identified by in situ hybridization.	0.9430611727616149
Treatment with etretinate resulted in remission of the fully developed KA and reduced the occurrence of new ones.	0.8503205601686037
The outbreak of multiple KA in our patient resembled a rare subtype described by Witten and Zak.	0.9015759834228998
Postclinical follow-up for 28 months to date has revealed that the KA arise from the subacute prurigo lesions.	1.042456237585709
This mode of prurigo-dependent KA development has not previously been reported.	0.8461382054380563
We describe a rare case of a papillary fibroelastoma of the aortic valve occurring simultaneously with a cystic tumor (a so-called mesothelioma) of the atrioventricular nodal region.	1.3320402864108645
At autopsy the tumor was found to prolapse into and occlude the right coronary ostium, leading to an acute, recurring myocardial infarction.	1.1810060665520734
Histological examination of the grossly unremarkable conduction system of the heart revealed a cystic tumor in the region of the atrioventricular node.	1.0544404383469521
To our knowledge, this is the first report of coexistence of these two rare cardiac tumors.	0.8788754431322989
Although still rare, pregnancy and delivery in women with spinal cord injuries is becoming more frequent (Table 2).	1.0306020050311355
In 85%-90% of patients with lesions above T6 symptoms of autonomic hyperreflexia (Table 1), especially paroxysmal and excessive increases in arterial blood pressure, may occur.	1.2117122084408598
In anaesthesising a 31-year-old paraplegic primigravida with a complete transverse spinal lesion at T4 for an elective caesarean section, no indication of hypertonic cardiovascular dysregulation either intra- or postoperatively was observed after repeated epidural administration of bupivacaine.	1.0719338484719716
Distinct intraoperative spasticity of the abdominal wall muscles was, however, not influenced by the dosages selected.	1.0674886726127046
Repetitive magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive, painless method to induce transient activation in circumscript regions of the human cortex.	0.9845563875011945
In contrast to TMS with single pulses rTMS allows a more effective stimulation of association cortex and temporary interference with the proper functioning of stimulated areas.	0.9564512388567807
Possible applications for examination of the functional anatomy of language lateralisation, memory functions and visual perception are discussed.	0.9762790134372784
Possible therapeutic for movement  disorders and depression are discussed.	0.8110797586447812
On the basis of theoretical considerations  and current experience rTMS induced epileptogenic effects are discussed and safety  recommendations are given.	1.0156775575783705
An unusual shaped piece of skin was found in the oral cavity of a woman who had been stabbed to death.	1.0150805310366118
Physical examination of the victim's numerous male acquaintances revealed one to have an injury of the same shape on the ventral surface of the left ring finger.	1.109512801618109
Molecular biological investigations showed that this suspect and the piece of skin exhibited corresponding DNA patterns (frequency 1 : 700 000).	0.8294870331569512
This case underlines the importance of physical examination as a preliminary to further detailed investigation.	0.8025819219703288
Nineteen men with post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence grade II and III (mean follow-up 12.7 months) underwent periurethral injections of collagen.	1.1060990457845912
In all, 37 procedures were performed; 58 % of the patients underwent the procedure at least twice.	1.1237466584287306
A mean of 16 ml collagen was injected.	0.796923761220484
The results were successful directly after injections, leaving all patients continent; however, after 3 months the treatment failed and all patients returned to their incontinence status as seen preoperatively.	1.2137266560019762
No perioperative complications were noted.	0.6554691626246537
Despite the simple and safe nature of this procedure, men with severe postoperative stress incontinence do not benefit from periurethral collagen injections.	0.9023136757129805
After a short review of the literature, some aspects of the psychodynamics and therapy of trichotillomania with an adolescent patient are presented that up to now have not been described in great detail.	1.1861945339807987
Against the backdrop of previous fears of being abandoned, the patient feels threatened that while coping with the developmental tasks of sexuality and aggressiveness she will be dropped once again.	1.0312079657803501
This psychodynamically oriented therapy makes it possible for the patient to accept and verbalize the corresponding feelings in a relationship that gives a feeling of security.	1.0121558491562996
Therefore, the symptoms that previously served the purpose of regulating diffuse inner tensions and fears may be abandoned.	1.1120040920839829
According to sonographic criteria, 55 patients underwent surgical treatment with mobilisation in a lower leg plaster or conservative treatment with early mobilisation in heel pad (3 cm) shoes when an acute Achilles tendon rupture (ATR) was diagnosed.	1.1367421911143447
The follow-up period in 51 patients was 2.4 years (operated group = 28 patients, conservative group = 23 patients) with clinical examination and testing of isokinetic muscle strength in knee joint flexion.	1.298184133683374
After surgical treatment, minor wound infections occurred in 10.6 %.	0.8585480036739791
Reruptures occurred in 13 % of the conservative group.	1.2395658019874571
Following conservative treatment, the rate of stress-related achillodynia was significantly higher (P = 0.019).	0.9560710877598295
In the operated group mean isokinetic muscle strength was 13.7 % lower than in the uninvolved leg and decreased significantly with non-operative treatment to 75.3 % (P = 0.012).	1.1013698965375824
We recommend surgical treatment of acute ATR.	1.059434362935209
The indications for conservative treatment depend on the extent of the rupture (measured by ultrasound in the equinus position), the desired level of daily activity and the patient's degree of compliance.	1.1795443837455808
"MicroSort" promises to become a reliable method for preselecting the sex of our children.	0.8816569523038564
As so many innovations in the field of assisted reproductive technology, however, sex selection raises difficult moral and legal issues.	1.0520887901340727
In this paper, we focus on the question whether or not sex selection calls for a legal ban.	1.0217514345433087
Since it does not seem to imply any serious harm to others, we argue in favour of the legalization of sex selection.	0.9987811823076062
Acute limb ischemia is an emergency which regularly requires operative treatment in departments of general surgery.	0.973581324393525
In about 70 % of cases there is an embolic reason for acute ischemia.	1.244799514666159
In the majority of cases urgent operative desobliteration is required to guarantee limb salvage.	0.9433977400174614
The introduction of balloon catheters reduced the surgical trauma significantly in cases of long secondary thromboses.	0.9778566449952412
More complex procedures are required in patients with preexisting chronic arterial occlusive disease.	0.8787662873415318
The mortality of these emergency operations is still 10-20 % with a limb salvage rate of 80-90 %.	1.158894004276485
Infectious complications related to acquired neutropenia have become a major medical issue, often requiring intensive care management.	0.9441681820388593
These infections may be lethal if empirical broad-spectrum treatment is not rapidly started at the first sign of infection (i.e., fever), and this concept is now widely recognized a standard practice.	1.1095220024205747
However, the choice of antibiotics has generated considerable controversy for nearly 25 years.	0.9751491195536418
After reviewing some particularities of infection in neutropenic patients, this paper will discuss the options and present comprehensive algorithm for non-infectious diseases specialist, including recent advances about early IV-oral switch and the selection of low risk patients for outpatient management.	1.1069388805467182
Background: It has been suggested that inflammatory processes play a role in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes (ACS).	1.1109164322059537
C-reactive protein (CRP) is a classic acute phase protein.	0.7906376128625364
It is yet unclear whether, in addition to established markers as troponin T (TnT), determination of CRP in patients admitted for ACS contributes significantly to the diagnosis and prognosis of ACS.Patients and Methods: We investigated 50 patients with ACS (59.4 SD 13.9 years) in the first hour after admission and 4-24h later with respect to TnT (Elecsys, Roche Diagnostics) and CRP (biokit, modified Quantex CRP plus, analytical sensitivity 0.02mg/dL).	1.1926413776093747
Fifty percent of the patients were classified as having unstable angina retrospectively.	1.1280695791514068
All patients were followed in the 6 weeks post discharge regarding death and recurrent ACS.Results: The cumulative event rate at 6 weeks after discharge was 62.5% for patients being CRP and TnT positive compared to 35.3% in TnT positive and CRP negative patients.	1.2104173881474036
In TnT negative patients a positive CRP test predicted 33.3% of events and 28.8% of patients negative for CRP and TnT had events at 42 days post discharge.	1.1786977314380962
Logistic regression analysis regarding the primary endpoint including TnT and CRP (4-24h values), age, gender and diagnosis resulted in independent prediction of ACS or death by TnT (cutoff 0.1µg/L, p=0.048, odds ratio=7.5) and CRP (cutoff 0.862mg/dL, p=0.026, odds ratio=5.3).	1.051416656688573
Sensitivity/specificity for AMI diagnosis were 69.6%/75% for TnT and 12%/72% for CRP in the first hour and 91.3%/68.2% for TnT and 68%/72% for CRP 4-24h later.Conclusions: Besides TnT, high sensitivity CRP determination has no additional value for early AMI diagnosis.	1.2487946627366104
The prognosis of these patients during the first 24 hours is significantly and independently predicted by CRP measurements in addition to troponin T.	1.2393128433289855
Purpose: Evaluation of clinical and morphological results in 44 consecutive patients with 45 aneurysms of the posterior circulation.	1.2304344436677876
Following coronary artery bypass grafting repeat ischemia mandatory for reintervention occurs in 2 to 30% of cases, depending mainly on graft age.	1.0900299698629086
Selection of a suitable strategy for revascularisation - transcatheter angioplasty or reoperation - depends on various parameters including coronary morphology, left ventricular performance, comorbidity and availability of graft material.	1.0364192342775986
Catheterbased interventions on saphenous vein bypass grafts are feasible, but lower primary success rates and a higher incidence of restenosis - compared with native coronary arteries - have to be expected.	1.182139623705389
Repeat coronary artery bypass graft operations are associated with a significantly higher perioperative morbidity and mortality, patency rates are lower and late clinical outcome is worse than in primary surgery.	0.9643104190220457
We report on a patient who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting 4 years ago revealing a high grade ostial stenosis in a jump-graft supplying RCA, LAD and Cx sequentially, making reintervention necessary.	1.062887198106032
As a prerequisite serial balloon angioplasty of two native vessels was performed prior to ostial intervention.	0.8133940028742902
Intravascular-ultrasound guided directional coronary atherectomy was performed with good primary and long-term result.	1.0532071182857925
Our case demonstrates that, if all relevant clinical parameters and different therapeutic options are taken into account, complex transcatheter angioplasty procedures are feasible and associated with a reasonable amount of risk, thus avoiding repeat coronary artery bypass graft operations.	1.1749496867353932
In recent years the indication for a mastectomy for breast cancer has been increasingly restricted.	1.0580921192740185
The use of plastic reconstructive techniques enhances the rate of breast-conserving therapy even for large breast tumors with excellent cosmetic results and oncological safety.	0.9754530458293333
The breast-to-tumor ratio and locally complete resection with free tumor margins of 1-2 cm are the most important factors in breast-conserving surgery.	1.1300155951935495
Different techniques of reduction mammoplasty within the concept of oncological breast surgery not only allow large tumors in large breasts to be resected, but also relatively large tumors in normal sized or even smaller breasts to be resected.	1.0750116300378008
Other advantages are the reduction of breast size and therefore target volume before postoperative radiation procedures as well as in cancer prophylaxis and risk reduction by reducing ipsi- and contralateral breast tissue.	1.0934675816435457
Reduction mammoplasty techniques with different resection areas have to be selected for individual tumor locations.	0.883695734806122
The best symmetry is achieved by bilateral mammoplasty in a one step procedure with lumpectomy and axillary dissection.	0.8595957276652322
Oncoplastic or reconstructive surgery in the target breast is often followed by procedures to improve symmetry by contralateral reduction.	0.9648026890458092
Whenever possible, mammoplasty techniques with minimal scarring should be chosen out of a variety of reduction procedures.	0.8667283186376548
Epidermoid cysts are rare, benign tumors of the testis or, less frequently, the inguinal cord.	1.1262644948001481
Generally, they affect males between 10 and 39 years.	1.0934802767440208
In newborns they are rare.	0.657371848958304
We report on a newborn with an epidermoid cyst of the right testis that had been diagnosed in utero and was removed with preservation of the testicle.	1.11110468109487
Although there are various published descriptions of the dura mater spinalis [4, 7, 9, 11, 16], some points relating to the texture of the collagen fibres in the dura have still not been adequately explained.	1.1686043100939758
In this study the orientation of the collagen fibril bundles was revealed with the aid of scanning electron microscopy, and our observations have yielded new insights into the three-dimensional structure of the human dura mater spinalis.	1.1257018624016895
Reconstructive plastic surgery is not always possible or advisable for nasal defects following tumor resections.	0.9501547326622872
Facial prostheses offer an alternative therapy.	0.5032250212717285
Since 1991, 37 patients with nasal defects after tumor surgery were treated in the Berlin Center of Facial Prostheses: 28 received "soft" silicone facial prostheses and 9 "solid" polymethylmetacrylate facial prostheses.	1.0740140659181643
In 35 patients protheses were bone-anchored: Brånemark implants were used in 12 patients and an Epitec frame construction in 23 patients.	1.044614168604847
Glue-on prostheses were applied to only two patients.	0.815265857073994
No intraoperative complications occurred at implant insertion.	0.7034945715714365
During following visits only minor inflammations were observed around implants and were treated locally.	0.8625608261880985
The implant success rate was 78% for the Brånemark implants (89.7% in non- radiated areas and 50% in radiated areas) and 100% in radiated and non-radiated areas for the Epitec system.	1.2922351880145593
Our investigation shows that given the right indication, the bone-anchored facial prosthesis is safe, cosmetically acceptable, uncomplicated and not stressful for the patient.	0.9806353866583771
We report a patient who developed malignant transformation of a cellular blue nevus.	0.9176527057165742
At the age of 19 years the congenital, pigmented tumor on the left buttock was histopathologically diagnosed as cellular blue nevus.	0.9947516992146404
Thirty years later the tumor dramatically increased in size, involving the entire left buttock within several months.	0.9346764208048454
Multiple biopsies revealed the presence of a cellular blue nevus within the papillary dermis and an invasive, pleomorphic pigmented sarcoma in the depth of the tissue spreading into subcutis and skeletal muscle.	0.9298606999347565
Both benign and malignant cells were S100+, vimentin+ and HMB-45+, but only the malignant tumor cells stained positive for the proliferating cell nuclear antigen.	1.058411401698724
General examination disclosed multiple metastases in the paraaortal lymph nodes and the retroperitoneum as well as a single brain metastasis.	1.1531968620353095
Despite palliative therapy with ionizing radiation and chemotherapy, the patient developed generalized metastases and died within weeks.	1.21247681559772
This case clearly confirms that cellular blue nevi have the potential for malignant transformation and that the malignant variant may behave aggressively just as a malignant melanoma.	1.0150514495071297
(Acitve alert) Hypnosis and sports in the psychotherapy of out-patients with anxiety disorders.	0.8484263723511484
A process-oriented approach combining hypnotherapeutic with cognitive-behavioral concepts within a systemic model of psychotherapy for the outpatient treatment of anxiety disorders is outlined.	1.0148859436004563
The use of active alert hypnosis (hypnosis by bicycle ergometry) combining elements of hypnotherapy and sports therapy is adapted to patients characteristics and the process of therapy.	0.9042265192511338
Relaxation and active alert hypnosis and different sports are used as methods of cue exposure respectively training of competence.	0.8989851167200531
The treatment is sequentially structured (motivation, symptom-control, conflict, integration).	0.8925618374298104
Active alert hypnosis catalyses the therapeutic process within the stage of symptom-control (reduction of anxiety and depression) and of conflict (modifcation of intrapsychic conficts or traumata within trance induced by physical exercises).	0.9885903518900389
Therapeutic goals and techniques for each stage are specified by case examples.	0.8201792862221178
Endoscopic techniques in the spine have become possible with improvements in instrumentation.	0.9088695830799268
Other minimally invasive techniques are limited to intradiscal surgery, not at the site of the pathology.	1.044968781891687
With the transforaminal approach, treatment in the epidural space has become possible.	1.0465030172785001
In a pilot study we investigated the pitfalls, risks, and complications of transforaminal surgery.	0.9332825056166311
Patient satisfaction and acceptance of the method were documented.	0.9947790007910486
Some 27 patients with disk pathologies at the level of the disk space, excluding extremely medially situated herniations, were treated.	0.9571278929039555
We used a standard posterolateral approach under local anesthesia combined with spinal morphine anesthesia.	0.9252714604509037
The treated levels were L5/S1 (11), L4/5 (12), L3/4 (3), and L2/3 (1).	1.2744412868012676
All areas could be reached by this approach.	0.7047081368336049
One procedure had to be abandoned because of instrumentation problems.	0.7706396940133472
One patient had recurrent disk herniation and had an open procedure.	0.8282044023372781
Two patients were reoperated because of persistent pain.	0.9244744936797071
No signs of reherniation could be found in these cases, but there was swelling of the nerve root and minimal scarring.	1.0745079780452842
Minor complications were trancient root paresthesia and headache postoperatively.	0.6801083914324134
Postoperative MRI or CT scans revealed only little scar tissue.	0.8177878660526825
This impression was supported in the open revisions we performed.	0.8444579199738539
Clinical acceptance of the procedure was excellent and the patients recovered very quickly.	1.1733588016617542
Endoscopic transforaminal surgery has a considerable learning curve, even when surgeons are acquainted with the posterolateral approach and arthroskopic surgery.	1.0194194213455778
However, it offers a good alternative to other minimally invasive procedures and has to be seen as a good alternative to open disk surgery, too.	1.2551979623075766
Quality management in a rescue coordination center (RCC) not only needs an evaluation of quantitative parameters (such as time intervals), but also an examination of the correlation between suspected and real found emergency situations.	1.1249222496730331
For that purpose it is necessary to request feedback informations about kind and severity of the emergency situation from the emergency medical team working at the scene.	1.0436967695645847
The case of a fatal catheter-induced cardiac tamponade in a 81-year-old woman is reported.	1.0169785453757256
Death occurred after a delay of 18 h following placement of a central venous catheter for parenteral feeding.	0.9093516141542368
According to the clinical and histological findings, placement of the catheter caused a primary perforation.	1.129894707522522
Confirmation of proper placement of the catheter tip was not performed.	0.8273512536220587
Despite clinical indications on the forthcoming complication, sufficient emergency treatment was not carried out.	0.9284311526771806
Background: The rapid integration of new technology into ophthalmologic practice, e. g. LASIK (laser in situ keratomileusis), is associated with new complications.	1.129395785241454
The limitations of the new technology cannot be precisely determined.	0.9058273764987341
During lamellar cuts with microkeratomes intraocular pressure (IOP) elevations occur.	0.7590861415683903
The IOP elevation during the lamellar cut cannot be determined by conventional tonometry.	0.8137830636476177
Due to its superior soft tissue contrast conventional MRI is the imaging method of  choice in the evaluation of ankle joint disorders.	0.9585593958231812
Conventional MR imaging can accurately demonstrate normal or acutely injured ligaments; however, in subacute and chronic injury joint fluid necessary for delineation of injured ligaments is absent and MR arthrography should be performed.	0.9790579580218836
MR arthrography uses the intraarticular injection of contrast material to distend the joint, yielding improved discrimination of intraarticular structures.	0.8505211000491422
This joint distension with MR arthrography is also helpful in the staging of osteochondritis dissecans, since in cases of unstable lesions tracking of contrast material into the interface can be more easily demonstrated.	1.0311414118215596
Finally, high contrast and joint distension by MR arthrography improves the detection of intraarticular loose bodies, which often require surgery.	1.2238266370502304
MR arthrography, although invasive, may provide additional information in various ankle joint disorders.	1.0643461388971311
Several studies have demonstrated an association Chlamydia pneumoniae with coronary artery disease, suggesting that infection with C. pneumoniae increases the risk for coronary artery disease by factor 2 or more.	1.1612852260143511
Since atherosclerosis is considered to be a chronic inflammatory process, these data would fit into the response-to-injury hypothesis of atherosclerosis rather than representing a completely novel concept.	1.0623047228986593
Several pathomechanisms as increased cytokine synthesis, proliferative and proaggregatory effects could transmit the effects of chronic C. pneumoniae infection.	0.9249809660727465
Animal models and first clinical trials using antibiotic therapy seem to support an etiological role of C. pneumoniae in coronary artery disease.	0.8982921886650582
In this paper the current knowledge of the role of C- pneumoniae in coronary artery disease is reviewed and possible pathomechanisms are discussed.	1.0825484540971337
Preeclampsia is a disorder specific to pregnancy which can affect all maternal organs.	0.8595631144732077
Cerebral involvement with the occurence of convulsions is the defining factor for eclampsia.	0.8119672696910551
The most prominent signs of cerebral dysfunction include headache, hyperreflexia, visual disturbances, confusion and/or altered state of consciousness.	0.9487338311091414
Patients usually recover completely however some patients remain disabled due to cerebrovascular damage.	0.7316618404516781
Intracerebral and subarachnoidal hemorrhage are severe however rare complications of eclampsia.	0.7320054308780213
TCD investigations regularly find vasospasm in all great cerebral arteries.	0.6927176413052369
Reversible hypodense lesions in the white matter on early CT-scans and increased signal intensities on T2-weighted MRT images indicate local edema.	0.8910410290166143
The etiology of preeclampsia and eclampsia remains unknown and its current pathophysiology is still hypothetical.	0.9140397705671423
The clinical picture may best be explained by an endothelial dysfunction with increased vascular sensivity to circulating pressure agents as well as by a structural endothelial lesion with fluid loss from the intravascular compartment.	1.0460991871214274
This article reviews the surgical treatment of chronic posterior knee instability.	0.923182970134378
The treatment rationale includes exact definition of the instability pattern ("envelope-of-motion" of the tibia) by clinical examination, arthrometry and stress radiography.	1.3173600421957505
Exact evaluation of the osseous anatomy is mandatory to identify an eventual varus morphotype.	0.9072607982279518
This osseous variant in combination with posterior/posterolateral instability should be treated by an osteotomy in every case.	0.9760749473133716
The technique of additive osteotomy to correct varus and increase the sagittal tilt of the proximal tibia is described.	0.9905970196585955
Ligament reconstruction in chronic posterior knee instability must address the posterior cruciate ligament and the lateral/posterolateral structures in many cases.	1.007913184052418
Patellar tendon grafts, quadriceps tendon grafts or hamstrings can be used for posterior cruciate ligament replacement.	0.9956618948694358
Arthroscopic or mini-open techniques may be used for graft placement, direct posterior fixation of the graft via a posterior incision is an option for patellar tendon grafts.	1.047676818632212
Bousquet's biceps plasty or Clancy's biceps tenodesis may be used for posterolateral stabilization; a biceps tendon strip can also be used for lateral collateral ligament reconstruction.	0.9440831295050491
Results of surgery are still moderate.	0.7636361512774406
In the author's series of chronic posterior/posterolateral instability, 26 cases were treated with posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and biceps tenodesis.	1.0864341281710492
Follow-up at 18 months demonstrated increased stability (mean residual posterior drawer 8 mm at 70  ° and 20 lb force) and improved knee function (33 % IKDC B, 67 % IKDC C).	1.2515279305056195
Presently, surgical treatment of chronic posterior knee instability should be restricted to centers devoted to this problem.	1.0864530555259226
This article reviews the current state of consensus reached for the diagnosis of myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy on the basis of conventional histopathological and immunohistochemical methods for inflammatory infiltrates in addition to molecular biological methods for persistence of viral genome in endomyocardial biopsies.	1.0220277758054506
Health policy in Germany has in recent years given priority to the self-administration of physicians, sickness funds, and hospital associations.	1.0194307756082228
Hence, legal regulations on quality assurance have focused on defining responsibilities and areas of primary importance, while precise processes are being defined by the self-administration.	1.0308692691234147
As prices for health care are increasingly restricted by lump sum payments, quality and quality assurance become more important as a factor in competition between health care providers.	1.005064610318709
To support the implementation of quality assurance in the health care system, the German Federal Ministry of Health has funded model-projects, e.g., to support the adaptation of successful strategies of total quality management for health care.	1.1617128343048915
The research field of tissue engineering combines cells biology, biomaterial science, and surgery.	1.0363186162243232
Major long-term goals are tissue and organ replacement therapies using the patients' own cells.	1.115397729740331
Our work is focused on the treatment of severe joint defects and on plastic surgery using in vitro engineered cartilage tissues.	0.93355802723732
The practical approaches in cartilage engineering face problems with three-dimensional cell distribution or cell immobilization raising biocompatibility problems.	0.8156805692003571
The tissue engineering of cartilage is based on combining biocompatible cell embedding substances such as fibrin, agarose, alginate, hyaluronic acid and fiber fleece scaffolds of poly -hydroxy acids (PLLA/PGLA).	0.8490023516936247
Different technical approaches were established: a) three-dimensional in vitro cultures of chondrocytes for the development of vital tissue transplants and b) interacting three-dimensional cultures consisting of different cell populations, such as BMP-transfected mesenchymal cells.	1.0353319470470268
The preshaped artificial tissue constructs were cultured in perfusion chambers to maintain a stable diffusion of nutrients during the in vitro pre-formation step.	0.9146317090124121
Subsequently, pre-formed tissues were implanted into nude mice and into 4mm articular joint defects of rabbits.	0.8675510484941352
Transplants were found to produce cartilage typic morphological patterns and matrix.	0.9218382157014755
80% of the transplants remained stable in vivo.	1.0422776664113529
However, 20% of the tissues are resorbed or replaced by a fibrous tissue.	1.2884176705747974
These results demonstrate that current artificial cartilage transplants are already feasible for plastic reconstruction.	0.7374131615443481
The treatment of severe joint defects, however, faces additional problems which are addressed in ongoing studies: (a) the fixation of engineered cartilage in joints, (b) the protection against chronic inflammatory degradation, and (c) the required enormous mechanical stability.	1.2114297732503994
Background: Silicon-rubber central venous catheters have become commonplace in the care of premature infants.	1.0784616174307065
We report on a rare complication, fracture and cardiac embolization of a silicone-rubber catheter and its interventional retrieval.	1.1069523733205184
The ARO multicenter study intended to show clinical and radiological differences with regard to different systems of fixation and designs of the prothesis in total hip replacement in patients with hip dysplasia, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.	0.9725240714092624
In 1987 and 1988 5255 total hip prothesis were implanted by the 24 hospitals which took part in the study.	0.8681162842834451
3133 prothesis (95,6 %) were clinically and radiologically examined.	1.119530423320582
The follow-up period averaged 6.9 years.	1.289217641649995
The results of the Aro multicenter-study showed that despite difficult preoperative conditions especially in cases of rheumatoid arthritis the satisfaction rate improved remarkably.	0.9704793945922604
During the operation less complications arose in comparison to patients with hip dysplasia and osteoarthritis.	0.9163102156273876
Regarding the rate of infection after operation there were no differences between the 3 groups.	1.146634745378507
Only the rate of postoperative luxation concerning rheumatoid patients turned out to be twice the number of the others.	0.9804012519524681
In our opinion this is due to the fact that these rheumatics were operated by posterior approach.	0.9428165098963058
Patients with rheumatoid arthritis were satisfied most with their surgeries.	0.7180477864564606
Results of rheumatic patients according to Harris hip score were slightly worse than the results of the two other groups.	1.0438586279433821
This was due to systemic involvement and bad preoperative function of the hip.	0.8650084015867087
As a result of the study there were no differences in using cemented or cementless techniques for rheumatic hip replacement.	1.1393041605011798
The decision for the method of fixation should depend on the patient's ability to relief the prothesis after operation.	1.03953553336542
The study has shown that cementless implantation can also be used for young rheumatics provided that a suitable design of prothesis will be selected.	0.9254499627595592
Sepsis developing on the basis of a postoperative infection is a rare, but life-threatening event.	1.1503576337900847
Early diagnosis of postoperative complications usually facilitates decisive intervention and a favorable prognosis.	0.9928801244252344
If the right moment is missed, endothelial damage leads to the release of inflammatory mediators and generalized systemic infection (SIRS).	0.8911362126601566
For the subsequentially developing septic shock, often combined with multiple organ failure (MOF), it is not important whether the starting point was an uncontrollable infections focus, ischemic damage following hypovolemic shock, or massive bacterial translocation with postoperative bowel obstruction.	1.0556536649220176
The collapse of the immune system results in immune paralysis and explains the inability of the organism to defend itself against systemic infections.	0.8577275163624063
For early recognition of the developing septic complication and its effective treatment, pathophysiological and clinical issues are discussed.	0.8636066335497962
The comparison of prediction of mortality and sepsis by different score systems was the objective of this retrospective study in 51 patients.	1.1558839793684221
Specific scores for burned patients - "Abbreviated Burn Severity Index" (ABSI) and the "Baltimore Sepsis Scale" (BSS) were compared with the general intensive score systems: "Mortality Prediction Model" (MPM II), "Simplified Acute Physiology Score" (SAPS II), APACHE II (ApII), "Hannover Intensive Score" (HIS) and the sepsis score developed by Elebute and Stoner (ES).	1.3693819791482864
On days 1 and 3 the true-positive ratio (sensitivity) was plotted against false-positive ratio (1-specifity) for each score.	1.1691790361981247
The area under the curve (max.	0.7193999772067945
0.5) correlates with the quality of the score system.	1.1302116481287243
We also tested the discrimination of septic and nonseptic patients by using the different scores.	0.9747994265628627
Bilateral symmetric changes in the cerebral hemispheric white matter are found with increasing frequency using CT and MRI techniques.	0.962459088627328
These unspecific canges of the white matter signal are often called leukoaraiosis.	0.7272067003034857
They differ from the normal white matter signal.	0.7729157356544248
These changes are found with increasing frequency in persons older than 60 years and also patients with dementia and cerebrovascular diseases.	0.981437835719737
The pathogenesis, clinical significance and morphological substrate are unclear.	0.9051230550442381
The aim of this review is to summarise the actual knowledge about the etiology and clinical signs and symptoms found in patients with leukoaraiosis.	1.1658565132372163
This term should not be used when white matter changes are found in patients younger than 35 years, with an unilateral onset, asymmetric distribution, and extensive changes all over the infra- and supratentorial white matter area.	1.1772069075681284
Neuroradiological and clinical criteria are given to differentiate between leukoaraiosis and diseases of the white matter, especially enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces, lacunar infarction, subcortical arteriosclerotic angiopathy (Binswanger's disease), leukoencephalopathy of different origin, and demyelinating diseases.	1.0820719629202995
A case with various skeletal abnormalities, soft tissue masses and skin lesions diagnosed as Proteus syndrome is reported.	0.9633010224196499
Proteus syndrome is included in the differential diagnosis of many disorders, because of the polymorphous nature of its clinical manifestations.	0.9366271062198971
It is a rare disorder and leads to functional disabilities as well as cosmetic and psychological problems.	1.1448580797634462
Early diagnosis and careful follow-up with appropriate surgical interventions is important in preventing long-term complications.	1.1497180331344445
The value of elective PTA in stenoses of the supraaortic vessels and especially of the carotid artery is still under discussion.	0.8957410064023893
Stenoses after surgical and/or radiation therapy and a high cardio-vascular risk for a surgical procedure, however, justify minimal-invasive techniques.	1.2052204308295562
Profiles of fundamental frequency sound pressure levels and voice duration are measured separately in clinical practice.	0.8015061146185297
It was the aim of the present study to combine the two examinations, in order to estimate the relationship between pitch, sound pressure level and voice duration and to develop a new computer-assisted graph.	1.0658622688666695
A three-dimensional (3D) wireframe phonogram was constructed based on SPL profiles to obtain a general view of the parameters recorded.	0.9289463516917148
We have termed this "phonetography".	0.6254498639845337
Variable further projections were selected for the analysis of different aspects of parametric relationships.	0.8138985290777337
The results in 21 healthy volunteers and 4 patients with hyperfunctional dysphonias demonstrated that there were three typical figures of the 3D phonograms produced, depending on the relationship between voice duration when soft ("piano") compared to loud ("forte").	1.20336290570278
In one-third of the healthy volunteers, the values of the piano voice duration were greater than those of forte for almost all pitches examined.	1.0451506132889234
In two-thirds of the healthy subjects the values of forte voice duration were partly greater, as were those of piano voice duration.	1.0160519026677268
All of the patients showed voice duration values greater for forte than for piano.	1.062187949355259
The results of the study demonstrate that the 3D phonogram is a useful tool for obtaining new insights into various relationships of voice parameters.	1.0929102169415126
Sinus histiocytosis is as a rule a benign disease of lymph nodes, infiltrated by large histiocytes.	1.0567854097867069
These cells show typical cytophagocytosis, particularly lymphophagocytosis.	0.9072856053022103
Other organs may be also involved by this disease, often including the skin.	0.9498639234245574
Exclusive cutaneous sinus histiocytosis without infiltration of lymph nodes seems to be very rare.	0.9919579867986823
To exclude other non-X histiocytoses or histiocytosis-X, it is advisable to use immunohistochemistry.	1.028667803555849
We report on a patient with sinus histiocytosis and discuss the problems of differential diagnosis.	0.9877527615897688
The case of a five-year-old girl with intractable fluor vaginalis and recurrent perianal fistulas is reported.	0.9788655537233446
A presacral dermoid cyst was shown to be the cause of these symptoms.	0.9485747853883649
Extensive radiological investigation revealed the cyst and the associated fistulas extending into the perianal region and the vagina.	0.8255208551785332
After verification of the anatomical situation, an uneventful surgical procedure was carried out.	1.161798851209414
Positron emission tomography (PET) is a noninvasive functional method for the study of solid tumor perfusion, metabolism and interaction with different therapeutic agents.	1.0231149024694328
The aim of the study was the investigation of the metabolism of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and the kinetics during a treatment with intratumoral ethanol by PET.	1.1195450732181287
The ongoing study includes seven patients with child A cirrhosis and HCC (UICC stage III-IVA; tumor size 3-6 cm).	1.0265841829636149
Dynamic PET studies (60 min) with 18F-fluordeoxyglucose (FDG) were performed prior to therapy to assess tumor viability.	1.2619051540586843
The evaluation of the FDG data demonstrated a liver-equivalent uptake in six of the tumors (well and moderately differentiated HCC), which were poorly delineated against the normal liver parenchyma.	1.1788401532632267
One moderately differentiated HCC showed an increased FDG metabolism, indicating no correlation between histology and metabolism.	0.9709356656298147
A dose of 37-80 MBq 11C-ethanol was applied together with a nonlabelled therapeutic dose of the drug via a puncture needle positioned under sonography.	0.9732153409179968
Five out of seven tumors demonstrated a high 11C uptake shortly after the end of the ethanol injection followed by constant 11C-ethanol concentration during the whole study period of 45 min.	0.9798296274135978
The PET data demonstrated no significant elimination of the 11C-ethanol from the tumor and no accumulation in the surrounding liver tissue.	1.0523396385568216
One case showed a decrease of the intratumoral 11C-ethanol concentration due to a punkture of a tumor vein, and in another case the surrounding liver parenchyma demonstrated significant 11C uptake in the early phase following paratumoral injection of the drug.	1.21614039178687
In conclusion, PET is a useful tool for the study of the mechanism and the kinetics of percutaneous intratumoral ethanol injection of HCC.	1.150018133994826
During the last decade, many investigations were conducted in order to understand the mechanisms involved in the development of acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).	0.9318098165136328
However, the increasing knowledge, instead of clarification, leads us to realize that these terms may assemble a wide variety of lung pathologies.	1.0933092452054887
Indeed, many circumstances can result in these syndromes and no particular factor has been defined to distinguish ARDS of one etiology from another.	1.0576905537197587
We are still ignorant about which factors lead to the extended inflammation from pneumonia to ARDS, while it is not clear whether the timing of events are determined by some mediators.	1.113733284594631
Furthermore, in the clinical arena, there is no clear distinction between pneumonia, severe pneumonia which may lead to ALI and then ARDS.	1.3437291652952226
Finally, the results of all these studies should have allowed us to investigate new therapeutical approaches while none seems to emerge.	1.0614661079644219
This review is an analysis by an ICU clinician of the different points of view of these syndromes and intends to give a global vision of the numerous factors implied, emphasizing the complex interactions between them.	1.1208401788959574
The present state about new potential treatments directed on mediators is summarized.	0.8217187924511278
The aim of the study was to evaluate if a combined physiologic-therapeutic scoring system (MARIS = Marburger Intensive Score) offers better outcome prediction compared to scoring systems, which are based either only physiologically (APACHE II = Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) or only therapeutically (TISS = Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System) in medical intensive care medicine.	1.1325615945324266
Main outcome parameters employed were hospital mortality, severity of disease classification and length of hospital stay.	0.9252007151451643
During a 12-months period (1993/94), 531 consecutive patients (ICU stay >4 hours) being admitted to a medical ICU of a tertiary care university hospital were prospectively investigated.	1.1178067771424234
The day-1-scores of MARIS, APACHE II, and TISS were determined and the patients were followed until hospital discharge or death.	1.1891579762073823
There was no advantage in using the combined scoring system (MARIS) neither in discrimination between survival and non-survival (hospital mortality; areas under the ROC-curve: MARIS = 0.84, APACHE II = 0.86, TISS = 0.78) nor in severity classification (relationship between day-1-scores and hospital mortality: p<0.001 (chi2-Test) in all three systems).	1.1004686573252096
In contrast only for the combined system (MARIS), a dependence of length of hospital stay from day-1-scores in the analysis of survivors only and in the analysis of all patients (survivors and non-survivors) (p<0.001; ANOVA) could be demonstrated.	1.0904781956961824
In conclusion the combined physiologic-therapeutic scoring system (MARIS) did not offer a better outcome prediction concerning hospital mortality and severity classification compared to the established systems in critically ill patients.	0.8972750541787823
Its use may be advantageous in evaluating the relationship between day-1-scores and length of hospital stay, which for economical reasons has become a parameter of growing interest in intensive care medicine.	0.9838648077087017
A 23 month old boy was admitted to hospital because of anemia, mainly truncal rash and unclear pain.	0.8930755741854
Previously he had shown fever, conjunctivitis and desquamations of hands and feet.	0.6800163308931487
Laboratory findings were moderate leucocytosis, thrombocytosis, anemia, and an elevation of ESR and gamma-globulins.	0.9542627754356837
No bacterial infection was found.	0.6097981667776842
The ECG showed signs of a myocardial ischemia.	0.9416783723753793
The sonography of the heart detected an aneurysm of the left coronary artery.	1.11606957205608
The boy died of a sudden cardiac arrest.	0.7464868331059589
The autopsy verified the diagnosis of Kawasaki-syndrome and revealed two coronary aneurysms blocked by thrombosis and a necrotic panarteriitis.	0.9732009986959528
The etiology of the painful hip in children is widespread.	0.944393216159576
In this paper, predominants cases without previous trauma are discussed in detail.	0.8355947075435302
Depending on age, history, clinical picture and laboratory results, an imaging diagnostic algorithm is presented, which should avoid unnecessary tests and lead to the necessary therapeutic measure.	1.2426324899880974
Several common as well as uncommon clinical entities are illustrated by representative examples.	0.8050896869335705
The present study exemplifies the method of quantitative reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction (cRT-PCR) by quantifying, in bovine tissues, the specific mRNAs for the two key proteins which regulate cellular cholesterol metabolism, the low density lipoprotein (LDL) -receptor and the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase.	1.2223634802597012
Our data reveal a broad range of expression for both mRNAs.	0.7949784204579683
The LDL-receptor mRNA expression was highest in the adrenal gland (6.7 x 104 molecules/ug cellular RNA) followed by the corpus luteum of the ovary, intermediate in the liver (8.6 x 102 molecules/ug cellular RNA) and not detectable in the large intestine.	0.9652756248977539
Expression of the HMG-CoA reductase almost paralleled LDL-receptor values.	0.7713685784382233
It was found to be highest in the ovary (6.1 x 106 molecules/ug cellular RNA) followed by the adrenal gland, intermediate in the liver (3.1 x 105 molecules/ug cellular RNA) and lowest in the large intestine (9.9 x 104 molecules/ug cellular RNA).	1.0129806675369353
These data are consistent with other reports concerning the quantitative analysis of the expression of both proteins as determined by other experimental approaches.	0.869217827680366
Thus cRT-PCR is a valuable tool for the quantitative analysis of the LDL-receptor and the HMG-CoA reductase.	0.8526397619595563
Spinal opioids are effective analgesics for surgical and non-surgical pain.	0.8268402492226574
Central and systemic side effects are less frequent than with epidural local anaesthetics or parenteral opioids.	0.9052879225354209
This review focuses on the analgesic efficacy of spinal opioids and their combination with local anaesthetics for postoperative analgesia, including patient-controlled epidural analgesia.	1.1144472668142122
Intrathecal administration of opioids has some advantages over their administration by the epidural route.	0.8769268563630208
Several factors may influence selection of the opioid; however, in most situations morphine is the drug of choice.	1.1346672445859636
Thoracic epidural administration of opioids seems to have no clinically important advantages over the lumbar route in terms of quality of analgesia, adverse effects, doses required or pulmonary function.	0.9687227890638292
However, evidence suggesting that effective postoperative analgesia can significantly improve postoperative morbidity in patients at risk is accumulating.	1.270382317153257
In such patients, combined use of epidural local anaesthetics and opioids may become the technique of choice for postoperative analgesia.	1.227571212369807
However, there is no evidence that this would have any clinically relevant benefit in low-risk patients.	1.16200762534481
This contribution summarizes a discussion of several experts on the field of clinical nutrition, which was held in Evangelische Akademie Loccum, Germany, May 20-21, 1998.	1.1506133089186408
Nutrition can be considered a medical treatment, which justifies assessment of benefits according to outcome parameters.	1.098285546739006
With regard to nutritional support of the cancer patient, evaluation of quality of life (QL) is more appropriate than morbidity and survival related parameters.	1.1119392721682966
Quality of life is a multidimensional construct which can be measured by standardized questionnaires.	0.9545664851891603
The QL Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), is an established and validated instrument which provides reliable information with regard to disease-related limitations of QL.	1.3344022304891483
The measurement of QL can be extended by appropriate modules for specific problems according to the underlying cancer disease and special therapies (e.g., percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy).	1.0184544064062642
In the individual case, the interpretation of the role of nutritional parameters for QL may be confounded by other parameters, such as disease or personal changes.	1.0130654506873518
However, the information supports decision making about the indication, the route of nutritional therapy, as well as individual follow-up.	1.0769197745317116
Using QL as an outcome parameter, carefully designed prospective trials might be feasible in order to investigate the outcome of nutritional therapy in patients with advanced cancer.	1.0555369442701161
The inclusion of a control group is questionable from the ethical viewpoint.	0.7619008711544861
The treatment of distal fractures of the lower arm can be conservative or operative.	1.1789632377570949
The immediate aims of any treatment are anatomical realignment and the avoidance of trophic impairments, with the ultimate objective of unrestricted function of the hand and wrist.	1.0973817194576572
A graduated treatment scheme based on the ASIF classification is necessary to do justice to the different forms of fracture that can occur.	1.068360823223283
The majority of injuries can still be successfully treated by conservative means; operative treatment becomes more important when there are signs of unusually high levels of instability or joint involvement.	1.0590353104473194
The authors' own patient population is presented in this paper: in these patients fixation with Kirschner wires has proved to be the most successful of the operative procedures used, followed by palmar plate fixation with or without cancellous bone plasty, and for C-type fractures according to the ASIF classification or when there is severe soft-tissue damage, application of a fixateur externe spanning the joint has proved best.	1.1667811534935595
Treatment strategy, risks, complications and results are presented.	0.8524958798581623
Many couples have to cope with periods of involuntary childlessness and they often ask for medical help.	0.7535422828661641
In the Heidelberg Project of involuntary childlessness in men, andrological patients were surveyed from the time before diagnosis till the end of 1 year's andrological treatment.	0.9779611599901592
Cardiac complications remain an important cause of perioperative morbidity and mortality with noncardiac surgery, despite improvement in surgical techniques and anaesthetic management.	1.0130541627907301
Therefore preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment plays a pivotal role in management of patients prior to noncardiac surgery.	0.8777104275736342
Thorough history-taking and careful examination are essential to consider further diagnostic steps in order to predict the patient's individual perioperative cardiac risk as accurately as possible.	1.0530752032008297
Besides elaboration of medical therapy, cardiac catherization and even balloon angioplasty or bypass surgery must be considered if indicated by preoperative cardiac testing.	1.0315582678223232
According to the literature, chronic ankle instability occurs after acute rupture of the lateral ankle ligaments in 10-20 % of the cases.	1.026669530698351
The etiology of the instability are ligamentous damage and functional neuromuscular disorder of the peroneal muscles.	1.0035837285168419
The standards of diagnostics are the history with the frequency of inversion trauma per period and the interval from the primary trauma, the clinical examination and radiological stress tests.	1.2154092678661004
Newer diagnostic methods, up to now not well established in clinical routine, include stabilometry, cybex-measurements of the pronator muscles, the evaluation of peroneal reaction time on a tilting platform and dynamic pedography.	1.0071604037979882
Conservative management of chronic ankle instability consists of wearing ankle braces and rehabilitation programs concerned with peroneal muscle strengthening and coordination training.	0.8156881849056185
The indication for surgical reconstruction of the ankle ligaments are a well-documented mechanical instability with the neuromuscular reflexes intact and a failed physiotherapeutic training program.	1.127135723586886
The surgical procedure should be selected according to a priority list: 1. anatomical repair, eventually augmented with periosteum from the fibula, 2.	1.1432962560858828
Watson-Jones tenodesis, and 3.	0.8647385489465081
Chrisman-Snook tenodesis to treat a concomittant subtalar instability.	0.6605400832890226
No other disease has exhibited such a significant influence on the behaviour of health care workers (HCW) as the AIDS pandemic.	1.0019342992482978
Numerous epidemiological data, however, have proven that the overall risk of transmission of the human deficiency virus (HIV) during surgical interventions is low; it is 0.3 % for all types of percutaneous exposures.	1.2936357329236527
Nevertheless, there still is a need for wider adoption of safer surgical techniques to reduce the chances of HIV transmission in the operation theatre, which additionally minimize the risk of transmission of other blood-borne pathogens.	1.2147272643873601
In the case of occupational exposure to HIV-contaminated blood or body secretions post-exposure prophylaxis should be recommended stratified by the type of exposure and source material.	0.9589878501510952
Abstract   Pachyonychia congenita (PC) comprises a heterogeneous group of autosomal dominantly inherited conditions showing characteristic nail thickening and associated signs such as palmoplantar keratoderma, follicular keratoses, and mucosal leukokeratoses.	0.88990600619262
Less frequently epidermal cysts, hairshaft abnormalities, natal teeth and laryngeal involvement may be seen.	0.7298725564589049
Phenotypically and genetically two major forms of PC are recognized, pachyonychia congenita Jadassohn- Lewandowsky/PC type I (Medelian inheritance in man - MIM - 167200) and pachyonychia congenita Jackson-Lawler/PC type II (MIM 167210).	0.9653391152932019
Both conditions show nail deformities, focal palmoplantar keratoderma, and follicular hyperkeratoses.	0.9708818147483718
Diagnostically relevant are leukokeratoses of the oral mucosa in patients with PC type I.	0.9450585779200157
In contrast individuals affected with PC type II show premature dentition and multiple pilosebaceous cysts predominantely affecting the upper trunk.	0.8089434325030131
The latter closely resemble eruptive vellus hair cysts and steatocystoma multiplex.	0.6254499598954173
By mutational analysis keratin K6a and K16 gene mutations have been detected in patients with PC type I, and keratin K6b and K17 gene mutations have been shown to be the underlying genetic defect in patients with PC type II.	0.9554119719130115
We investigated the incidence of postoperative chest tube bleeding, administration of blood products, and changes in coagulation tests in patients with diltiazem (DIL) administration for reduction of myocardial ischemic episodes during elective CABG.	1.0497153977033227
We retrospectively analyzed the surgical and ICU records of CABG patients who had recieved DIL (27 pats.)	0.9782628788330876
or nitroglycerin (NTG; 26 pats.)	0.6759162547626599
or a combination thereof (COM; 25 pats.).	0.7359885046122577
Data investigated included the amount of postoperative chest tube bleeding (CTB), frequency of administration of packed red blood cells (RBC) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and changes in hemoglobin (Hb), thrombocyte (Th) levels as well as changes in prothrombin- (PT) and partial thromboplastine time (PTT).	1.1442906692199977
There were no significant differences among the three groups with regard to biometrical or operative data.	0.9626805765696828
The amount of CTB as well as the use of RBC and FFP were not significantly different between the groups.	1.0662992673495952
Also, there were no significant differences with regard to Hb or Th and PT or PTT, both in the early phase after the operation in ICU as well as after 24 hours in the ICU.	1.1602311851488003
The perioperative administration of the calcium entery blocker DIL reduces the incidence of myocardial ischemia during CABG surgery.	0.9296874258377685
This administration during CABG surgery does not increase the risk of postoperative bleeding.	0.7596847027268753
As compared to NTG, DIL does not have negative effects on Hb and Th levels or the commonly used coagulation parameters in the first 24 hours in the ICU after CABG surgery.	1.0019122382596244
Depression and fibromyalgia (FM) share common symptoms, indicating a close relationship between both disorders.	0.8586144573606858
FM patients frequently present symptoms of major depression.	0.7617351019851583
Genetic epidemiological studies show that genetic transmission is one important component.	0.8390402023563833
Molecular genetic studies are on the way; the serotonin transporter promoter gene seems to be associated with neurotic anxiety and FM.	0.9479412861337435
Biochemical studies related to the serotonin and norepinephrine neurotransmission are disturbed in both disorders.	0.8373219415257978
This view is supported by the response to treatment with antidepressants.	0.8802298941147862
At our hospital, closed dislocations of the elbow without neurovascular or osseous lesion are treated conservatively after successful reduction in the absence of a tendency to redislocation.	1.1011639581297756
Indications for surgery are irreducible dislocations and those with a tendency to redislocation as well as open soft tissue injuries, neurovascular and osseous concomitant injuries.	1.0160500096817784
During a period of 10 years 113 patients were treated according to this strategy.	1.012306101343029
Of these patients, 46 had simple dislocations of the elbow and 67 suffered from dislocations with osseous lesions.	0.9451850140475555
In 95 patients follow-ups could be performed after a mean period of 55 months.	1.1105717179086498
In more than 75 % of cases good or excellent functional results were documented; unfavourable results were seen only in patients with osseous lesions.	1.1681828956720655
Nearly all of the patients had a stable elbow joint at the end of therapy.	1.204877573615108
The present study investigated the frequency and influencing factors of petechial bleeding (PET) in the conjunctivae and eyelids in different causes of death except strangulation.	1.0792205280845304
In a series of 473 autopsies the over all occurrence of PET was 13.3%.	0.7700624698617279
The highest frequencies were found in fire victims (31%), persons who had died after intensive care (24%), cardiac death (22%), drowning and intoxication (16% each).	1.2331587510912325
The frequency of PET decreased with increasing age and increased with the body mass.	1.033034877278231
At first sight cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) seemed to influence the occurrence of PET, because the rate was 11% without and 19% with CPR (x2: p < 0.05); an aspect which has been mentioned in the literature.	1.0270749439492541
However, further analysis showed that a higher rate of PET could only be observed in causes of death where PET are often fround irrespective of CPR, whereas in the other groups PET (with or without CPR) are uncommon.	1.3148079245337922
Furthermore, a case-by-case analysis showed that in several cases with PET after CPR the causes could clearly be attributed to conditions other than CPR.	1.2222504471480764
In a second series of autopsy cases with only cardiac deaths (181 cases), the influence of age and body mass on the rate of PET was statistically significant and there was a tendency for more frequent PET with increasing heart weight.	1.1449621688098812
On the other hand, no statistically significant influence of CPR on the rate of PET could be found in this relatively homogeneous group.	1.084015130977702
Media reports convey the impression that the incidence of fatal accidents in the European Alps has been increasing yearly at an alarming rate.	0.9001544697787973
Although objective data is lacking, the annual reports of the mountain rescue services in Germany, Austria, the southern Tirol, Switzerland and the Chamonix region in France were analysed with respect to the fatal and non-fatal accidents which occurred between 1987 and 1997.	1.096587635813542
Because of varying definitions of "mountain accident" used in these countries, available data about the number of fatalities are not comparable.	0.9708753660433185
A 75-year-old man had painless, slowly enlarging tumors in the right and left infrascapular regions.	1.1001453874763107
Clinically, the tumors were nontender and semimobile.	0.9386797772930713
MR imaging and the operative exploration revealed tumors infiltrating the lateral thoracic muscles and periost of the scapula and underlying ribs.	0.9139955991779906
At surgery, the tumors were thought to be malignant, most likely liposarcomas.	1.1688287910850348
The histological examination showed the characteristic appearance of elastofibromas with spindle-shaped fibroblasts, which were separated by thick eosinophilic collagenous and elastic fibers.	1.0637388768593492
Elastofibromas are benign mesenchymal soft-tissue lesions that mainly affect elderly women.	0.8041118897469312
In 10 % of the patients bilateral, often asynchronous tumors are seen.	1.0931338862059614
Ninety-nine percent of the lesions are located in the subscapular region.	0.9032620291319802
Occasional elastofibromas have been described in the extremities, head, and in the abdominal and thoracic cavities.	1.2731736305671273
The relative success of thrombolytic versus surgical therapy of thrombus in transit has not yet been evaluated in clinical studies.	1.0234170136287934
Only case reports of one or more patients exist.	0.9079266708076459
Optimal therapy, therefore, remains controversial, and conclusive recommendations in favor of one choice of therapy over the other cannot be given.	1.147870235395203
Nevertheless, in current practice thrombolysis as a noninvasive and quickly available form of therapy is preferred, if no contraindications exist.	1.263141311758722
Two cases are presented together with a literature review.	0.9864030859649985
The Comèl-Netherton syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive hereditary disease.	0.8190011078151179
A 23-year old female presented with the classical triad of ichthyosis linearis circumflexa, trichorrhexis invaginata with bamboo hairs of up to 12 cm length and atopic diathesis.	0.915686528409882
Nevertheless, more than 20 years passed before the final diagnosis was established.	1.2935432656430075
In addition, the patient was slightly mentally retarded and suffered from a genital papillomatosis, minimal hypergammaglobulinaemia and a marked bilateral eyelid ectropion, more severe than previously reported.	1.175431861602107
Oral therapy with Acitretin was quite successful.	0.7114477910636721
Background: Recent studies have shown the usefulness of pars plana vitrectomy with the use of growth factors in the treatment of macular holes.	1.1537193333784759
Autologous platelet concentrates contain many growth factors to stimulate glial wound healing.	0.7672728142746725
In vitro fertilisation IVF and intrazytoplasmic sperm injection ICSI are the most commonly used methods of assisted reproduction.	0.8536645454900024
Whereas classic indications for both treatment options are widely accepted, for example severe tubal damage which cannot be microsurgically repaired, cryptozoospermia, severe OAT syndrome and repeated failure of fertilisation in normal IVF, ICSI might be indicated in a wider range of indications as well.	0.9915142988958473
In this paper a number of additional ICSI indications are defined, for example minor forms of andrological subfertility, reinsemination of nonfertilised oocytes on the day after conventional IVF, reduced motility of cryopreserved sperms, reduced quality of oocytes or ICSI after one cycle of unexplained fertilisation failure in IVF.	1.0866609972423553
Load on the human body can be influenced by shoes and surfaces which is important both in sports and rehabilitation.	1.0021793312760119
The loading which can primarily be influenced are impact situations and friction as well as the stability of the foot.	0.9724357823211857
This stability is of main interest in the prevention of pain and injury.	0.9420896522921361
However, a certain amount of loading is necessary to improve strength and structure of biological materials.	1.2540991442875715
In the past, the development of shoe and surface materials has hardly been perceived under this aspect, but may be increasingly important in the future.	0.9958509195521336
With optimal clinical management of patients with Marfan syndrome, life expectancy may be improved substantially from 32 years to a nearly normal life span.	1.0163288004428452
Cornerstones of clinical management comprise genetic counseling, life-style management, and cardiovascular surveillance, which includes regular aortic imaging and endocarditis prophylaxis.	1.106609458483298
Prophylactic use of beta-blocking agents as well as timing of elective surgery and the choice of the optimal surgical technique are difficult issues that obviously need to be individualized.	1.0032131531875597
Juvenile or postoperative patients as well as pregnant patients with Marfan syndrome pose particular problems.	0.7674119266791133
This review intends both to facilitate differential decision making based on referenced evidence and to provide guidelines for therapeutic strategies.	0.9234143630206404

In Germany, good clinical multicenter studies that are not supported by pharmaceutical companies are rarely performed.	0.991755874246875
Good supranational industry-sponsored studies are usually aimed at the registration of new (expensive) drugs.	0.864098875148285
The preconditions for co-operation in conducting industry-independent studies which are of interest for the scientific community have been improved substantially in Germany by instituting the working group of co-operating arthritis centers, the so-called core documentation where 32000 patients with rheumatic conditions were documented in 1997 and the institution of a sophisticated information system ("RheumaNet").	1.0606408838151677
The executive board of the German Rheumatology Association has set up an "ad hoc commission" that agreed to institute a "Committee for the Coordination of Clinical Studies in Rheumatic Diseases".	0.9628644868822342
In this committee rheumatologists subspecialized from medicine, orthopedic, pediatrics working in universities, hospitals and private practice as well as specialists in statistics and epidemiology shall be represented.	0.9119763947269007
In principle this committee is independent of the co-operating arthritis centers and the RheumaNet.	0.7699270168983446
All members of the German Rheumatology Association are invited to cooperate with this committee by contributing to the clinically important questions and participating in clinical studies.	0.865498696941181
The committee has to define key questions in rheumatology and shall plan and organize multicenter studies to answer these questions.	0.8440947147436413
In addition, study protocols of pharmaceutical companies may be examined as to their importance, quality, and feasibility.	1.1079627088205055
Abnormal uterine bleeding is a gynecological problem frequently seen in women from adolescence to the postmenopausal period.	0.894257851030528
Nearly 70% of patients' visits to the gynecologist in the peri- and postmenopausal period are due to abnormal uterine bleeding.	1.150816769166212
According to the "speed"-hypothesis of cognitive development, the slowing of information processing in old age is at the core of negative age differences in psychometric intelligence.	0.9905078114936184
The present study investigates the "speed"-hypothesis for fluid intelligence at the individual level using Latent Growth Curve Methodology.	1.0721421276164436
Date on 4 measurement points come from the Bonn Longitudinal Study of aging (N=128, mean age 67.2, 53% women).	0.9414780851266608
Based on principal factor analysis, markers of mental speed were the WAIS Digit Symbol Test and simple psychomotor task.	0.8123762582067333
As indicators of fluid intelligence the WAIS Object Assembly and Block Design were used.	0.7291203625229651
After separately fitting Latent Growth Curve Models for the trajectory of mental speed and fluid intelligence, a combined model showed no statistically significant improvement of fit for freeing the covariance between the two slope-factors.	1.0047637741833604
Interpreting this result, contrary to the "speed"-hypothesis the intraindividual change of fluid intelligence does not relate to the according change of mental speed.	0.8821043730392516
For patients with dilative cardiomyopathy (DCM), the prognosis is highly unfavorable, even under conditions of optimal medication.	1.088532896432952

Since there is increasing evidence that modifications of the immune system accompanied by the production of autoantibodies, e.g., against 1 ad-renergic or muscarinergic receptors, are involved in the pathogenesis of DCM, the elucidation of the possible functional significance of these autoantibodies has attracted increasing interest.	1.049419728180367
In addition to the role of autoantibodies as markers for an autoimmune process, discussion of the possible pathogenetic mechanisms has centered on direct toxicity as well as on negative influencing of myocardial contractility and energy metabolism.	1.0774163595096817
The effects gained through removal of autoantibodies by immunoadsorption therapy for DCM patients sheds light on the functional importance of autoantibodies in this syndrome.	0.8744657305672732
The principle of this form of therapy is based on the binding of circulating antibodies to sepharose columns, to which polyclonal antibodies against human immunoglobulin are linked.	0.962154403471207
A pilot study conducted among DCM patients disclosed that immunadsorption took place in simultaneous conjunction with a reduction in the immunoglobulin level and with significant hemodynamic and clinical improvement.	0.9889783757759559
These results may be interpreted as indicating that autoantibodies play an active role in DCM and that their removal by immunadsorption possibly represents a highly promising future therapeutic concept.	0.9314540084613814
Active unspecific immunotherapy in an adjuvant or palliative setting has been shown to enhance survival in melanoma patients, and gene therapy now offers new perspectives for active specific immunotherapy.	1.0209811355896965
Gene therapy includes the transfer of genetic material performed by either viral or non-viral methods and in vivo or ex vivo.	0.95816528073511
For melanoma the following approaches are suggested: vaccination with tumour-specific, HLA-associated antigens using peptides or `naked DNA', vaccination with melanoma cells transfected with cytokine genes or B7, adoptive immunotherapy with specific T-lymphocytes or transfected tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, or transfection of tumour cells with a tumour suppressor gene whose dysfunction plays a crucial role in melanoma.	0.9146541882258111
Since 1995, a total of 115 patients with pseudarthrosis or delayed bone fracture healing have each undergone a single session of shock wave treatment.	0.9584039759249066
After the treatment the fractures were correctly set according to the rules of conservative bone fracture treatment.	1.0435348640904
The mean follow-up period for all patients was 31 months (range 3-50 months.	1.2479197297783418
In 87 cases (75.7%) bony consolidation was achieved with simultaneous reduction in the symptoms.	1.1952139227672807
Apart from low-grade local reactions (swelling, haematoma, petechiae) no complications were observed.	0.8987448938497209
The treatment is noninvasive and requires little investment in terms of personnel or technology.	0.8868558870621467
Extracorporeal shock wave therapy should therefore be considered before an elaborate operative procedure is initiated in the treatment of pseudarthrosis and of delayed fracture healing.	1.029549456443871
The sound transmission properties of three different commercially available middle ear implants and the prototype of a complete middle ear prosthesis (CoMEP) were evaluated with a special measurement system that permits standardized conditions.	1.124872148706448
This system uses a mechanical middle ear model (MMM) which approximates the impedances of the tympanic membrane and inner ear.	0.9101140211909231
The implants were fitted under defined conditions into the MMM.	0.7370680141774163
Displacement of the artificial stapes footplate of the MMM was measured with an optical probe.	0.9306684468842183
The measurements of different middle ear prostheses showed that the mass of the implant was the most important factor for optimum high frequency transmission.	1.1334867790907956
The lightest implant (4 mg, titanium) showed the best results.	1.2241667632079984
The CoMEP revealed the highest sensitivity because of a slight enlargement of the diameter of the artificial tympanic membrane.	0.9920300943805674
These findings show that the CoMEP is able to restore sound transmission to a normal range.	0.9051027464597934
In a second experiment one of the implants was fitted into the MMM with different forces.	1.1973405108655168
The increase of stiffness produced a slightly better high frequency transmission at the expense of low frequency sensitivity.	0.9283500876182377
Hence, the fitting of the implant may not be too stiff because of its loss of mobility within a significant frequency range.	1.1289545457448151
Angiomyolipomas are hamartomas that may be found sporadically or associated with tuberous sclerosis (M. Bourneville-Pringle).	0.8940364977004079
Clinically, this long-term asymptomatic tumor becomes evident as an acute retroperitoneal hemorrhage or by symptoms of a flank mass.	1.2175507564161536
Due to the high percentage of fat components in this tumor type, computed tomography is far superior to other radiological procedures.	1.0481149918149792
In view of two of our own case reports, the therapeutic strategies are discussed, paying regard to the actual literature in this field.	1.3724077557413958
The excact pathogenesis of Peyronie's Disease (PD) is still unknown.	0.8967723190504898
Histopathological investigations suggest, that the metabolism of the collogenious tissue plays an important role.	0.9664891525648853
Therefore, we started a prospective study in order to evaluate the metabolic situation of 11 patients with PD and 11 healthy controls.	1.3258513083981276
We mesured biochemical parameters of penile and venous blood, wich correspond to the collagen metabolism (procollagen III [P III P], PMN-elastase [PMN-E], fibronectin [FN], fibronectinreceptor [FN-R] und -1-proteinase-inhibitor [-1-PI]).	1.1417267745353068
There was no difference in PMN-E, P III P, FN and FN-R in all samples.	0.999499808725245
There was no difference in penile and venous blood as well.	0.807530043200551
But we found out a highly significant lower concentration of -1-PI in patients with PD (158,55 mg/dl) than in controls (214,82 mg/dl).	1.1914405293137271
Closed rupture of the anterior tibial tendon is rare.	0.8534944538969358
Fewer than 50 cases have been reported in the literature, perhaps because the symptoms are often neglected by the patient as well as by the doctor.	1.1576906441030166
Most often the rupture occurs as a consequence of a sudden plantar flexion of the ankle and pre-existing degenerative changes of the tendon tissue due to systemic disease or iatrogenic local corticoid injections.	1.127009881186905
Clinically, the tendon rupture presents as acute weakness of the ankle extensors without reddening, swelling or neurological signs.	1.0482054565280554
Differential diagnoses such as anterior tibial syndrome and peroneal nerve palsy can thus be excluded.	0.8357691335302462
During the clinical examination the distal stump and the discontinuity of the anterior tibial tendon are often palpable.	1.1301545820136083
The clinical diagnosis can be confirmed by an ultrasound examination.	0.8618891359394816
An operation may be undertaken up to 3 months after the injury.	0.9670066185760172
Preferred procedures are end-to-end anastomosis and transosseous refixation of the tendon, followed by a plaster cast for 6 weeks postoperatively.	1.0001333002168382
High-risk patients can be treated conservatively, but the functional results are less satisfactory.	1.5106523923086421
We describe a case of an acute closed rupture of the anterior tibial tendon.	1.1965302993438938
A yet unpublished method of osseous reinsertion of the tendon is presented.	0.8928575824569068
In this four-part review article, an update of Psychological Gerontology since 1988 in German speaking countries is given.	0.9684774120812899
Part II of this review focuses an personality development in old age.	1.060302057048781
In accordance with their current relevance within research on personality development, concepts and empirical studies concerned with coping, psychological resilience and development regulation in old age are addressed in the first part of this review (contributions to basic research).	1.0173659387847611
First, research based on the two-process-model of coping, the personality theory of Thomae and the life-span theory of control is summarized.	1.1267347614952035
Next, work on subjective well-being, self and self-regulation are highlighted.	0.9796617042902254
In the second part of the review (contribution to applied research), an overview of the scope of potential of psychotherapeutic intervention in old age is given.	1.1622852595387856
Background: According to literature, 30-60 % of pacemaker patients suffer from paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF).	1.273863051794572
As rapid tracking of PAF may cause severe symptoms in patients with dual chamber pacemakers, refined algorithms providing AV synchronous pacing during periods of sinus rhythm and preventing high ventricular rates during PAF are highly desirable.	0.9017902572394547
Aim and method: This comprehensive paper introduces a new mode switching (MS) algorithm which uses either a fixed (Inos2CLS) or programmable (Logos) number of short intervals out of 8 consecutive atrial intervals to detect PAF.	1.0030937540133085
If the MS criterion is fulfilled, a switch from AV synchronous pacing to nontracking mode is automatically performed.	0.8473931687834215
The algorithm is described together with a discussion on optimization of the programming of parameters which may indirectly influence the MS sensitivity and specificity.	0.976716682736018
Results: This MS concept maintains the high sensitivity and fast reactivity towards PAF of the "mode conversion" in Actros and Kairos pacemaker systems, preventing a long time delay between onset of PAF, detection of the arrhythmia, and switch to nontracking mode.	1.1591322459219828
In addition, adequeate sensing and short blanking periods in the new MS concept enable reliable MS.	0.9833293509972589
The occurrence of atrial oversensing should be tested, as it may lead to inappropriate MS. Programmability of the MS algorithm may be advantageous for individual programming with respect to the patients' arrhythmia rate and atrial sensing performance, but the use of very restrictive or very liberal criteria should be avoided as both may lead to mode oscillations.	1.1608647990190981
Finally, examples of stored diagnostic data are presented to assess MS reliability, identify possible problems, and optimize MS function during follow-up.	1.0749880620499397
Purpose: To evaluate MR imaging at 1.5 Tesla in patients suffering from acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) using proton-density weighted (PDW) fast spin echo (FSE) and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences.	1.0814484395107757
A number of infectious agents has been newly detected in the last 10 years.	0.9839787565658028
Climatic hanges and migration have been the most important factors in the emergence of new and old infections.	1.006087963807487
Additionally, new methods for the detection of DNA and RNA have played an important role in the detection of agents difficult to culture.	1.0512777837841496
So far medical requirements for aviators have been defined by national licensing authorities.	0.8001200866929852
For a long while ophthalmological problems, insufficiencies in vision, refraction or color vision, have been responsible for approximately 50 % of rejection of applicants for medical reasons.	1.050175907871526
Introduction: Coronary arterty disease still remains the primary cause of death in the western industrialized world.	1.2165472518344316
Although the clinical value of selective coronary angiography (SCA) is beyond dispute, the associated risk of an invasive approach, the inherent costs and the necessary hospitalization have lead to the development and investigation of novel non-invasive techniques for coronary imaging.	1.2327955202664347
Intravenous coronary angiography (ICA) has been shown to permit non-invasive imaging of the coronary arteries.	0.9855003686638135
We report nine case histories of patients admitted to a psychiatric hospital for severe somatic disorders.	0.9429091954558214
The somatic disease was either the cause of the psychiatric symptomatology, or it occurred in addition to a well-known psychiatric disorder.	1.1711044395342407
For general practitioners and psychiatrists it can be difficult to differentiate between symptoms due to psychiatric disorders and symptoms that indicate somatic disorders.	0.8811849535243024
If patients refuse the necessary diagnostic or therapeutic procedures and show behaviour that is not related to good health, there is increased risk for complications and increased morbidity.	1.1545238383928413
Penetrating neck injuries are potentially life-threatening injuries.	0.8612385474432653
Management is controversial despite decades of discussion in the literature.	0.6846975839521214
An algorithm for diagnosis and therapy is needed because of the potential risk of mortality.	1.0603087675739071
In the Department of Trauma Surgery of Vienna Medical School, mandatory surgical exploration after noninvasive investigations is practiced.	0.9258161942450804
Thirty-one patients with this kind of injury were treated between August 1992 and September 1999.	1.0363491154598024
Injuries were caused in seven cases by gunshots, in eight cases by broken glass, in one case by an iron rod, in one case by a spear, in one case by a branch and in 13 cases the penetrating injuries were stab wounds caused by knives.	1.2431130925316949
Complications like pseudoaneurysms and fistulas were not seen.	0.6620504452571709
No patient came to death.	0.47017916276465616
During a 18-year-period 93 patients (f=76, m=17) with a factitious disorder were identified in the psychiatric consultation service of a university hospital (incidence: 0.62%).	1.1559581901197178
50% of women were working in medical professions whereas only 6% of men.	1.3879934919350914
Chronic courses of illness were prevailing, but at least one quarter of female patients showed an intermittent type.	1.1993550855559714
There was a classical Munchhausen syndrome in 11% of patients.	1.0247745072049126
Depressive and anxiety disorders (10%, 4%) were to be respected as psychiatric comorbidity.	1.321711553689261
Ca 25% of the patients suffered from a somatic illness in addition to the factitious disorder, and one third of the women had symptoms of psychosomatic, especially of eating disorders.	1.2419071774132366
Previous somatoform disorders, deliberate self harm and attempts of suicide were to be noted in the psychiatric history of many patients.	0.970660600528232
There were frequent traumatizing events (foster home, disturbing family disharmony, physical and sexual abuse, early losses, serious illnesses) in the early biography.	1.1062004948742805
Various psychosocial stressors could be identified in the actual eliciting situation.	0.9818079314636644
The results are discussed in respect of epidemiology, development and clinical phenomenology of factitious disorders, psychodynamics and psychopathology of deception and self harm, and therapeutic options in the psychiatric consultation service.	1.047267244612364
In a long-term follow-up we evaluated 40 patients out of 55 (73 %) with a subtalar fusion.	1.1531927194353737
The operations took place from 5/84 to 5/91.	0.8116337245269194
In all cases the indication for the fusion was a post-traumatic arthritis after an intra-articular os calcis fracture.	1.1345221586094494
The evaluation of the overall results was carried out with three different scoring systems: a.	1.1464259066147784
The Outcome-questionnaire, rating patient's complaints and the functional status based on the severity-symptom scale and functional status described for Carpaltunnel-syndrome by Levine et al.	1.0621948223074478
c. The clinical rating system (CRS) described by Kitaoka et al.	1.1109119916503074
The statistical evaluation was performed by analysis of variance (ANOVA).	0.8962825032568621
Level of significance was based on P = 0.05 and calculation of Pearson's correlation coefficient.	1.007243796715351
The Os calcis fracture was the cause for the subtalar arthritis in all 40 patients (33 males and 7 females).	1.0299249337406182
The primary treatment of the calcaneal fracture was conservative (cons.)	0.9210917900403879
using a plaster in 23 patients (57.5 %), while 17 patients (42.5 %) underwent open reduction and plate fixation (op.).	1.1287649310623613
The interval between trauma and subtalar fusion averaged 3.5 years (3 months to 20 years).	1.1433392279872971
The interval between subtalar fusion and follow-up averaged 5.2 years (4-14 years).	1.0564305103319913
The mean age at the time of reexamination was 47 years (26-61 years).	0.9380767824580472
In the present study, complete pain relief could be achieved in 21 (52.5 %; 58 % op., 50 % cons.)	1.2204385120772583
A relevant restriction in the range of motion in the ankle joint was found in 26 (65 %; 76 % op., 58 % cons.).	1.2496630435005975
In 23 patients (62 %; 65 % op., 59 % cons.)	1.106901167095233
the radiological evaluation revealed a grade 1  ° arthritis of the ankle joint, in the talonavicular joint in 17 patients (42.5 %; 41 % op., 45 % cons.	1.1796081901170157
), and in the calcaneo-cuboid joint in 14 patients (35 %; 47 %., 27 % cons.).	1.3803852443013265
The statistical analysis revealed a better outcome in the operative group compared with the conservative group, although the operated os calcis fractures in the majority were the more severe fracture types.	1.3939104231934802
In all evaluation systems a score between 61 and 69 points could be achieved with no significant difference between the operatively and conservatively treated groups and between the newly developed questionaire and the clinical-radiological scoring systems.	1.032728954317123
For the questionaire this fulfills the requirements for a reliable outcome evaluation.	0.8094923896587483

Non-palpable breast-lesions like microcalcifications often fail an exact diagnosis.	0.7939449716999957
Accurate treatment is difficult by conventional marking and operating procedures since freehand positionin of al localization wire is often suboptimal.	0.8589101680625519
The consequences are larger tissue-defects leading to an insufficient cosmetic result.	0.8424152109734949

Digital mammography coupled with stereotactic biopsy procedures gives more accurate results with minimal invasive techniques.	0.8186472428824749
The advantages and disadvantages of the advanced breast biopsy intstrumentation (ABBI) procedure versus vacuum biopsy systems are summarized and compared.	0.8582988471690983
Either of those systems is highly accepted by the patients due to the outpatient manner of its application and the convincing results regarding sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the methods.	1.0996747044665023
Chondroid syringoma belongs to the group of so-called mixed tumors, like pleomorphic adenomas of the lacrimal and salivary glands.	0.9665890077374297
The histogenesis of this tumour is still disputed, in particular with respect to its stromal component.	1.2298813149095185
The distribution of cytokeratins (CKs), CEA, EMA, vimentin, S-100 protein, desmin and actin [-smooth muscle actin (-SMA)] was investigated by immunohistological examination of paraffin sections from a chondroid syringoma of the apocrine type.	1.0880468362190359
The neoplastic formations have been classified into tubuloalveolar structures, solid nests/aggregations and stromal cells of varying morphology.	0.8299785383915178
The innermost cells of tubuloalveolar structures were characterized by marked expression of CKs (KL1 and MNF116), CEA and EMA, while in the outer ones there was moderate expression of vimentin, S-100 was expressed to a lesser extent and KL1, weakly but there was marked and consistent expression of MNF116.	1.0455400381259734
Whereas the solid nests expressed vimentin, S-100 protein, MNF116 markedly and KL1 weakly, the stromal cells were consistently positive for vimentin, S-100 protein and, focally, CKs and -SMA.	0.933265371347143
Anti--SMA specifically detects myoepithelial cells.	0.5347532692494127
In addition, the partly overlapping immunoreactivity of the intermediate filaments, membrane proteins and proteins in the different structures may indicate a common clonal origin of all neoplastic cells in chondroid syringoma.	0.9844947000029278
Leg ulcers may be caused by many different diseases.	0.6263980603181188
Most frequently, they are due to vasculopathies, to a lesser extent to metabolic, neuropathic or hematologic diseases.	1.0257223151669626
Neoplasms, connective tissue diseases, infections, trauma, and panniculitis should also be included in the differential diagnosis.	0.8057372735074705
A 38-year-old Caucasian female patient with hereditary prolidase deficiency developed progressive and very painful leg ulcers.	1.0086515569131016
The ulcers first appeared in childhood and did not respond to various treatments.	0.8338952617113726
Additional features of prolidase deficiency included mental retardation, short stature, extensive dental caries, and multiple malar teleangiectases.	0.9349298459426101
Hereditary prolidase deficiency is a very rare autosomal recessive disease.	0.8360754182816698
It is caused by heterogeneous mutations of the prolidase gene and affects many aspects of protein metabolism.	0.7586629114740874

In this paper the basic features of acute, subacute and chronic types of osteomyelitis, skeletal tuberculosis and some special forms of osteomyelitis are described.	1.0716728359784384
The diagnosis of osteomyelitis is established using clinical signs and symptoms, culture studies, laboratory studies and radiological signs.	1.0544580967343733
The common conservative and surgical treatments are discussed.	0.7251924947422438
In the treatment of post-traumatic/postoperative osteitis severe problems are encountered as a result of an increasing number of orthopaedic traumatologic surgical techniques using a variety of implants and because of a generally increasing occurrence of multiresistant strains.	1.027474748276571
Thanks to modern treatment and the increased use of antibiotics, a considerable decrease in morbidity and mortality is observed.	1.203470303310771
Despite this improved prognosis, an established infection remains one of the most challenging problems for the orthopaedic surgeon.	1.0997148981243707
Besides an exponential growth in possibilities for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention in reproductive medicine and genetics, the synergistic effects of modern health technologies have led to the necessity of fast transfer of knowledge into the public domain in order to develop a common social consensus.	1.0595579955952934
Thus, physicians and scientists have enormous obligations not only for the development of medical technology but also of medical and societal ethics.	1.1272264607716138
Very early, i. e. in 1984, the German Medical Association developed professional laws for reproductive medicine.	1.0858354837825355
In addition, the German government saw the need in 1990 for an "Embryo Protection Law" (Embryonenschutzgesetz).	1.1097027187064283
Today, in the light of European integration, the medical profession's and state's obligations are challenged in different ways.	1.17289771467332
Whereas the German Medical Association continuously works on professional guidelines for reproductive medicine and genetics - currently the case with preimplantation genetic diagnosis - the government must develop the sociolegal framework for ethically sound reproductive medicine, i. e. , in the areas of inheritance law, adoption law, family law, and law of succession, the latter especially in the case of discrepancies between genetic vs. social paternity in heterologous insemination.	1.2000738718711903
In Crohn's disease, some concomitant neurological illnesses such as cerebral ischemia following arterial or venous thrombosis, subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord following malabsorption of vitamin B12 or folic acid, opticus neuropathy, and polyneuropathy have been described.	0.9667462393127444
Cerebral vasculitis secondary to Crohn's disease seems to be a very rare phenomenon.	1.152225220726774
We report on three such cases in three female patients (aged 26, 29, and 61 years).	1.2571044906731352
All patients became symptomatic with a hemiparesis; one complained additionally of a speech disorder, headache, and intermittent loss of orientation.	0.9747243015445988
In CT and MRI scans, multiple lesions were detected; cerebral angiography showed multiple stenoses of middle- and large-sized vessels that were compatible with cerebral vasculitis.	1.0486384849862898
Serologic tests concerning vasculitis were inconspicuous at that time.	0.6025800744179356
Under anticoagulation (in two cases) and immunosuppressive therapy, neurologic symptoms disappeared.	1.1623879038368718
In the following 6 to 12 months, no new neurological symptoms appeared.	1.145709688070037
In two cases, Doppler sonographic controls showed stationary and, in one case, progressive intracranial stenoses.	1.0337054316818273
The serin protease tryptase (ECNr.	0.6162325569080949
3.4.21.59), which is almost exclusively expressed in mast cells, is released by mast cell degranulation in an enzymatically active form together with other mediators, e.g.	1.086034872978205
histamine, into the extracellular space and the circulation.	0.8590154170252713
The capability of the enzyme to directly stimulate several cell types as well as to cleave polypeptide hormones and to activate pro-enzymes suggests a role for tryptase in inflammatory and tissue-remodeling processes.	0.9838370468034343
Therefore, in the skin, a role of tryptase is suggested not only in mastocytosis and immediate type hypersensitivity reactions, but also in other inflammatory diseases, degenerative or neoplastic conditions as well as in wound healing, where an accumulation and/or activation of mast cells is found.	1.2286288540692367
Extracellular tryptase may be superior to histamine as a parameter for the onset and course of immediate type reactions and as an indicator for the activation of mast cells in other conditions.	0.9963985712588441
Its absence during histamine-liberating reactions may suggest basophil activation.	0.6408013780142608
In addition, tryptase has been shown to be a sensitive and specific marker for the localization of mast cells in tissues.	1.1445422971846009
Background: Since the development of lacrimal endoscopes with which the mucosa and disorders of the lacrimal drainage system can be examined directly, the choice of surgical technique has changed decisively.	1.2139738612091948
Flexible miniendoscopes can be combined with a laser for the first time, allowing for exact localization of the stenosis and subsequent therapy.	1.0024251626121243
Surgery of tibial plateau fractures with joint involvement (AO classification 41 A1, B1-B3 and C1- C3) makes high demands on traumatological management.	0.9109748937384626
By using modern, minimally invasive operative techniques for juxta-articular fractures, it is possible to prevent soft tissue injuries that might affect the functional result.	1.1642748365810298
The aim of this technique is to achieve the exercise stability obtained with standard procedures.	1.3159147211230824
Arthroscopically assisted osteosynthesis not only minimizes the surgical soft tissue trauma, but also enables a precise assessment of the articular surfaces under the operation, as well as the simultaneous treatment of concomitant intra-articular injuries, a particular advantage as compared to conventional operative methods.	1.2091772286607971
From a total of 54 patients with tibial plateau fractures, arthroscopically assisted osteosynthesis was performed in 34 patients at our clinic from September 1994 to January 1998.	0.9639613500800528
The follow-up of a total of 17 patients revealed good recoveries when assayed by means of the Lysholm and Delamarter score.	1.084787499582702
We suggest that arthroscopically assisted, minimally invasive osteosynthesis can also be used in selected patients for the treatment of AO classification 41 C1-C3 fractures.	1.0715620711075686
Dorsal tension band fixation is a wide-spread technique of finger arthrodesis.	0.8770885879367895
When using a resorbable PDS-suture as tension band fixation a costly implant removal is not needed.	0.8551280779604508
Aim of this study is the investigation of the primary stability of this technique in combination with the cup-in-cone-procedure.	1.3321783731458008
Freeze-preserved fingers with thread tension band fixation using the PDS-material (series 1), the same fixating method on formaldehyde preserved fingers (series 3), freeze-preserved fingers with a standard tension band fixating (wire loop, series 2) are load in a four-point-bending in the direction of palmarflexion.	1.1464727413447102
From 6 degrees onwards the wire-tension-system requires a higher torque for bending, but in case of higher torque frequently leads to fracture.	1.0257410933160058
The examination shows that the thread-tension-band method by PDS-loop for the stabilisation of finger joint arthrodesis has a sufficient initial stability against bending forces.	0.9042556311615612
Modern medicine has succeeded in achieving enormous technical developments.	0.6397747690295981
One recent highlight has been the introduction of postmortem organ transplantation.	0.8055122591012808
At the same time, serious objections have been raised concerning the radical changes in the cultural conception of the inviolable body.	0.8460920059161121
One major objection arises from the conflict of considering a brain-dead person as dead.	0.787853786486518
The presence of brain death is a prerequisite for post-mortem organ donation, because only during this phase of dying does the individual quality as dead while the organs, other than the brain, remain viable.	1.0866675747040624
The objection implies scepticism as to the physician's ability to distinguish a dead from a living person.	0.9445005336208039
On the other hand, even the critics must rely on the physician's ability to discriminate, e.g., when to discontinue resuscitation.	1.0825847473932402
The medical community has not found reasons to restrict the definition of irreversible coma 25 years after its first formulation.	0.9813722261595104
It must be clearly recognised that reasons other than medical ones can be decisive for refusing organ donation.	0.8368647749380083
One ethical problem is the therapeutic benefit of organ transplantation.	0.8309860890928278
The beneficiary of the treatment is not the donor, but another person, the recipient.	1.4468004674999257
The concept of human dignity does not allow the use of a person fur purposes other than the ones he/she consents to, as Immanuel Kant stated.	1.0172891746023753
Although the human corpse is not a person in the full sense, even if it is protected by the thought of respect for the former person, the life-interest of the organ recipient had to be considered legitimate.	1.1973282972719805
The resulting conflict between the respect for the donor and the life-interest of the recipient should be balanced by seeking the donor's consent as far as possible.	0.8822064357456914
The proposed information model seems adequate at the moment.	0.7726108508112712
A common report of both churches in Germany in 1990 supported postmortem organ transplantation.	0.868703665489374
The report dealt with the medical problems and harmonized them with the Christian value of solidarity.	0.9127425430808069
The ethical alternatives to organ transplantation, however, are not mentioned.	1.0794559113058255
Within this limitation, the report seems to adequately express the aim to strengthen individual competence and plead for fair perception of the neighbour's life-interest.	0.9946848134637123
Starting point for this analysis are the mobility needs and requirements of elderly, as well as problems concerning access and use of public transport.	0.902804567573282
Elderly people as car drivers suffer from several performance deficits which are currently compensated by mobility restrictions and changed driving behaviour.	0.832137986657688
Driver assistance systems, just available or soon on the market, are demonstrated and analysed with respect to their impact on elderly drivers.	0.9857965511806841
An expert evaluation comes to the conclusion that the most important systems for elderly are: emergency systems, enhanced vision systems and parking aids.	1.0295954670174066
Emergency systems can call rescue teams automatically or at driver's request, and direct them to the emergency location.	0.9960361870841914
Self imposed restrictions of elderly concerning night driving can partly be compensated by means of curve lightning and automatic dipping.	0.7560143895957762
Parking aids, using cameras or infrared technique are especially helpful for persons with movability problems.	0.9125982029826757
The group of helpful, but not highly important driver assistance systems covers several means for longitudinal and lateral control of the car, comprising autonomous cruise control, antilock systems and electronic stability programmes.	1.0903960580615966
The value and impact of these systems are analysed in the light of risk homeostasis theory.	1.0837993423863304
Reduced work load and ease of mobility will at last result from user centered navigation systems, helping the elder driver also to move to new areas without orientational problems.	0.8129515667998098
The article demonstrates the particular importance of specific layouts of the man-machine-interface for elderly, to guarantee high acceptance and minimal distraction from traffic.	1.013212524640865
Causal treatment regimens of proven effectiveness in controlled studies are only available for cases of male infertility resulting from hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.	0.9847395465340981
Drug treatment of retrograde ejaculation is also effective but has so far not been tested in double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized studies.	0.914119345314034
The results of immunosuppressive therapy in cases of immunological male infertility are still controversial .	1.0191769838143305
In addition, antiphlogistic and antibiotic treatment of chronic male genital tract infections has not been shown to improve male fertility.	1.274918310374218
Inconsistent results have been obtained with empirical therapy - e.g., with kallikein, tamoxifen, clomiphene, pentoxifylline, mast cell blockers, testolacton, vitamin E, captopril, alpha receptor blockers, glutathione, indometacin, interferon alpha, growth hormone, zinc salts, ketoprofen, mesterone or testosterone undecanoate - or the studies performed are not sufficient to allow a final judgement.	1.0951830636988638
Recent studies have indicated a possible impairment of sperm function by pure FSH, while GnrH and FSH have no influence on spermatogenesis in normogonadotropic men.	1.027975710161194
In 40 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), in 5 patients with non-AD dementia and in 36 cognitively normal controls the concentration of protein tau was determined in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).	1.0289616858431831
Of the AD patients, 19 were very mildly demented (MMSE score from 25 to 28).	0.8620046020919219
Even in these patients, CSF tau was significantly more elevated than in controls.	0.799348634948853
In the non-AD patients protein tau was less increased.	0.7321132946582138
Among the AD patients there was no association between CSF tau and severity of cognitive impairment or deficit in cerebral blood flow, determined by SPECT.	0.9442807906697414
Our findings suggest that CSF tau may be elevated even at the predementia stage of AD and be useful as a biological marker for the early recognition of the disease.	0.9043346425722502
The aim of our review is to summarize relevant data on the perioperative use of anti-ischaemic drugs in patients at risk for or with proven coronary heart disease.	1.0536740004488772
The accessible medical literature according to current electronic information sources was explored.	0.7187000990833142
One in every eight general anaesthetics is administered to a patient at risk for or with proven coronary heart disease.	0.7525792342759948
Of these patients, it is estimated that 20% - 40% have perioperative myocardial ischaemia (PMI), the majority being nonsymptomatic.	1.3631502835193636
This figure correlates with the occurrence of postoperative cardiac complications and myocardial infarction.	0.7748007528161687
The anaesthetist therefore has an important role to play in reducing the rate of perioperative cardiac sequelae.	1.028291683246814
This can be achieved with good control of haemodynamic stability and the timely and appropriate use of antiischaemic drugs.	1.015625314060993
Nitrocompounds (nitrates, molsidomine) serve as the gold standard in current angina pectoris treatment.	0.9163773156187507
Acting as coronary and systemic vasodilators, they effect an immediate reduction in preload and have been shown to be the drugs of first choice for intraoperative myocardial ischaemia.	1.1503318974858583
Beta-blockers reduce the rate of PMI to a greater extent than nitrates.	0.9164492823791416
They are also effective in myocardial ischaemia not accompanied by an increased heart rate.	1.0175376815424473
Single pre-operative administration of beta-blockers has also been shown to be beneficial in reducing theincidence of perioperative tachycardia, hypertension, and PMI.	1.0278213993896879
Consequently, such one-time medication can be considered for previously untreated high-risk patients presenting for surgery.	1.357134516118495
The continuation of oral calcium channel blockers to the morning of surgery also reduces the rate of PMI and myocardial infarction in coronary-bypass patients, and combination with beta-blockers enhances this effect.	1.0407419314288475
Intra-operative diltiazem infusions are similarly advantageous in this patient group.	0.785962531115067
In addition to nitrates, calcium antagonists are the drug of choice for coronary vasospasm.	1.1282924929950389
Drugs inhibiting platelet aggregation have a particular role in patients with coronary heart disease, however, they also cause increased perioperative bleeding.	1.0611344961696436
Consequently, it is recommended that these medications be discontinued 5 - 10 days prior to major surgery, with the exception of high-risk patients.	1.287941866877009
Pilot studies using alpha2-agonists have shown reduced anaesthetic requirements and a reduction in PMI.	0.8121782677790161
The perioperative relevance of these drugs is currently being investigated.	0.9422036749528492
Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, and possibly alpha2-agonists lead to reduced rates of PMI and other cardiac complications in risk patients.	0.969184915373414
Current anti-anginal medications, with the exception of anti-platelet agents, should be maintained to the day of surgery and continued as soon as possible thereafter.	1.0929572655149502
All of these drugs except anti-platelet agents may also be used intra-operatively, however, possible interactions with anaesthetic agents should be carefully considered.	1.236474045953999
Inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) were thought to be psychosomatic disorders.	0.7596670471293648
However, this argument has recently been questioned by many researchers.	1.1911840941624594
At the same time, biomedical factors have been described that were claimed to play a role in the aetiology and modulation of the course of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).	0.9750519825240226
In the present paper, the state of research regarding both biomedical and psychosomatic factors of the aetiology and course of IBD is reviewed and critically evaluated from a methodological perspective.	1.1919064936467878
Results covering the following topics are presented: epidemiology; sociodemographic variables; genetic factors; dietary factors and cigarette smoking; drugs; permeability of bowel epithelia; immunological factors; microbiological factors; psychiatric disorders, affective symptoms, personality factors; life events and psychosocial stress; quality of life; and coping with the illness.	0.9354333563404761
Among biomedical factors, a genetically based pathological immune reaction is highly probable.	0.9622359359068112
However, the findings of immunological disturbances are of a more descriptive nature and seem to explain not the aetiological process of the development of the disease, but rather a kind of disposition.	1.2197426354189544
The question of which agents trigger the pathological immune cascade is still under investigation.	0.9964694427393963
Interesting findings can possibly be expected of the psycho-neuro-immunological research in this area.	0.7459612273238909
Results of research on psychological pathology (psychiatric disorders, personality factors) are inconclusive.	0.9466346174128191
In particular, some modern, well-controlled studies have not been able to confirm the findings of the older literature.	1.1363639406218855
Part of the high rate of psychiatric morbidity might be due to effects of selective sampling of more disturbed subjects.	0.9945031302199371
Research pertaining to the influence of distressing life events has also yielded inconsistent results.	0.8071686060083221
Prospective studies about the association of psychosocial stress and somatic symptomatology mostly demonstrated cross-sectional correlations which did not allow for causal interpretations.	0.8589757964897485
However, coping research has shown interesting results that point to the mediating influence of coping strategies on the course of the disease.	1.0132762116789662
Finally, perspectives for future research are suggested.	1.0795756284494278
Genital infection, particularly bacterial vaginosis (BV), increases the relative risk of prematurity.	1.224519729908063
Detection of disturbances of vaginal milieu at an early stage and the use of suitable countermeasures such as intervention with antimicrobial substances can reduce the preterm birth rate.	0.8651797933784768
A pregnancy with a partial or complete hydatidiform mole and a coexistent living fetus is a rare condition.	0.9760483189023453
Most cases are consistent with a twin pregnancy, with distinct borders between placenta and mole on sonography.	0.9777066091927772
We report a case with a single placenta with cystic structures resembling histologically a complete hydatidiform mole.	1.1751514370039016
The pregnancy resulted in a diploid female fetus in the 34th week of gestation with marked hypotrophy.	0.7891819188012383
The non-molar part of the placenta showed a complex alteration of villous maturity resulting in intrauterine growth retardation but a living fetus.	0.8666645786234521
No malignancy occured post partum.	0.5022268459089266
The clinical and pathogenetic aspects of this rare entity are discussed.	1.1813709571671895
So far, necrosis of the lunate bone has been interpreted in the literature as a phenomenon with a traumatic, primarily vascular-arterial or mechanical causation.	1.027319724862541
These models seem problematic, since neither the patients' histories nor the macroscopic-radiographical or histological appearances can be reconciled with them.	0.9929435642768305
In contrast, the model of a primarily venous aetiopathogenesis accepted for idiopathic necrosis of the femoral head is now examined.	1.0136402365456938
Evaluation of 125 cases of lunate bone necrosis treated in the Department of Orthopaedics at the University Hospital in Heidelberg between 1958 and 1993 made it possible to reconstruct the spontaneous course of the condition.	1.0683879554091786
X-Ray material, core spin tomographic images and material from a prospective study carried out in 49 patients with unexplained painful conditions of the wrist were available.	1.0956868764909777
A stage-by-stage progression emerged, which initially caused alterations only in the MR image, while the X-ray picture remained unremarkable.	1.2000009677854864
It was recognized from the spontaneous course that subsequent changes in the shape of the diseased lunate bones were always the result of the necrotic transformation process and never the cause of it.	1.0468619439478235
This meant that fractures were excluded as a possible cause of necrosis of the lunate bone.	0.8073656005943848
The spontaneous course was used as the basis of a stage-related classification for lunate bone necrosis.	1.1798394747179284
In a pressure measurement test, the behaviour of the intraosseous pressure in 16 necrotic lunate bones, 16 healthy lunate bones and 16 healthy capitate bones was tested under various functional conditions.	1.0441012822407383
The pressure fluctuations in the capitate bones were very slight, while in the healthy lunate bones pressure increased significantly during extension of the wrist.	0.9877642344431239
The position-dependent pressure increases in the lunate bones indicated that the venous drainage was constantly in jeopardy.	1.0206599612919285
The pressure increases in necrotic lunate bones were significantly in excess of those in healthy ones; in some cases they were far in excess of the systolic blood pressure.	0.9600101204199865
It was also concluded that necrotic lunate bones were mechanically deformed on movement.	0.8169650584217761
The anatomical causes of the pronounced pressure increases were examined experimentally.	0.8559221986488027
After staining of both the arteries and the veins, epoxy sheet plastination was used to fix six fresh cadaver arms in the neutral position and six in extension.	0.9269655025518149
Visualization of the vessels showed that capsular-ligamentous structures that were stretched on the palmar side and slackly turned back on themselves on the dorsal side still allowed the blood supply from the arteries, but substantially hindered venous drainage.	1.0395798965506546
The anatomical preparations made it possible to see that venous drainage from the lunate bone was being prevented; this explained the pronounced pressure increases.	0.9363732888422729
The unphysiological position of the base of the radius inclined in the palmar direction relative to the hand axis when it was extended dorsally was the crucial factor in the development of necrosis.	1.0138058073561687
Evaluation of the histories of the patients with necrosis of the lunate bone made it clear that trauma was not significantly involved in the causation, while manual work had an important role.	1.1948218550689227
Most manual activites are performed with the wrist in extension.	0.8582360874973368
Any extension favours triggering of bone necrosis through congestion in the venous trunk.	0.8417222762340314
Thus, our investigations have shown that the beginning of this illness starts with congestion such as occurs with every extension of the wrist, which is initially physiological, before further factors favouring the process cause it to take a pathologic course.	1.2930551656453042
The results of the German National Health Interview and Examination Survey 1998 confirm allergies as widespread diseases in Germany.	0.9239692711855391
In total 40 to 43 % of the adult population have or have had an allergic disease.	1.0555808546537493
The morbidity was assessed using a self-administered questionnaire and a personal interview performed by a physician.	0.9972370470140292
The agreement between questionnaire and interview data is greater than 90 % for allergic rhinitis, food allergy and urticaria and about 80 % for contact dermatitis and asthma.	1.2008098501765754
The results of both assessment methods showed remarkable differences between East and West Germany.	0.9403279423123421
Using the interview data 17 % of the West but only 11 % of the East German adults have/had e.g.	1.0765446895138586
Comparable differences exist for contact dermatitis.	0.5767950009782555
Many people with allergies suffer or have suffered from several allergies.	0.7418376107814709
Frequent patterns of combination are food allergy/allergic rhinitis and asthma/allergic rhinitis.	0.7100501228107181
In comparison with former studies we observed an increase of 70 % in the prevalence of allergic rhinitis between 1990/92 and 1998.	1.1787008066486226
The relative increase is higher in East than in West.	0.7922434910164068
The time trend in prevalence of asthma could only be calculated for the West German population.	0.7834252026836057
The results show a remarkable increase here, too.	0.9202069974191431

X-ray of the chest showed a marked enlargement of the heart extending to the right.	1.2594963562581463
Echocardiography revealed an impressive displacement of the heart chambers to the left caused by a large aneurysm (11x5x5 cm) located anteriorly and medially from the right heart communicating with the right atrium.	1.1019671852066735
Pronounced compression of the basal part of the right ventricle was present.	1.1921654130651282
Within the aneurysmatic cavity several highly mobile thrombi and extensive spontaneous echo contrast were demonstrated.	0.699191081452557
On magnetic resonance imaging and right heart angiocardiography the aneurysm was visualized as well.	1.0438102835973981
Coronary angiography revealed a marked curved displacement of the right coronary artery to the left side.	1.0370649944389263

Possible influences of skin functions such as resorption, excretion and as a temporary reservoir for drug substances on hair analysis is discussed.	0.8922308062779482
The relevance of skin secretions and their interactions with keratinized hair fibers is outlined.	0.7537479068584771
For the emergency treatment of sustained, hemodynamically stable ventricular tachycardia, antiarrhythmic drugs are the therapy of choice.	0.9039485426948695
Mostly class I antiarrhythmic drugs, such as lidocaine or ajmaline, are preferred.	0.9935450664395823
In hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia, electrical cardioversion should be applied, in case of recurrences, followed by pharmaclogical treatment with class I antiarrhythmic drugs or amiodarone.	1.0048005149050963
For the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death, -blockers and/or amiodarone are the only effective drugs.	1.22210106206175
In the secondary prevention, only the implantable cardioverter/defibrillator has proved to improve the prognosis of the patients.	1.1961963555369837
Insular carcinoma of the thyroid is a low differentiated type constituting about 5 % of all thyroid cancers.	1.241281848521733
Higher aggressiveness has been suggested as an important clinical feature.	1.062996307465124
The value of preoperative fine-needle aspiration biopsy is not clearly proven for insular carcinoma.	0.8273795250475989
The criteria for histological diagnosis have been outlined by Carcangiu et al.	0.7780002113574647
Because of its aggressiveness, radical treatment at primary surgery appears advisable.	0.9091621796957768
Its clear distinction from undifferentiated (anaplastic) and medullary (C cell) cancers is important, as thyroglobulin is regularly synthesized by cancer cells.	1.0701810505244442

Follow-up should be performed as in highly differentiated papillary and follicular thyroid cancer.	1.1313774011029203
A patient series of eight cases is presented.	0.7574361128610957
While all cancers were advanced at the initial diagnosis, the observed disease courses were in agreement with the assumption that insular carcinoma is a more aggressive form of differentiated thyroid cancer.	1.0254282954367118
The result of an investigation of 128 from 283 (45,2%) medical and psychological psychotherapists established in the city of Hannover is presented.	1.2163288880240033
The aim of the study is to characterize the situation of psychotherapeutical care not only by the number of psychotherapists in relation to inhabitants but also by the working time spent for psychotherapy.	1.0198752425970445
Besides we found gender, school of psychotherapy and professional experience as factor influencing the patients waiting time for beginning a psychotherapy.	0.9599988741723525
In contrast to other studies, the number of medical and psychological psychotherapists is not different, nevertheless the psychotherapeutical care in Hannover is not ensured.	1.128978382545554
Objectives Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament in children without creating permanent damage to the tibial or femoral physes.	0.895847357526643
The semitendinosus tendon, left attached distally, is passed through a tunnel in the tibial epiphysis, led through the joint, passed behind the lateral femoral condyle and fixed to the outer aspect of the femur with a staple.	1.0309168855786564
The anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is one of the rarest coronary anomalies which often remains asymptomatic until the patients achieve advanced age but may also be clinically manifest already in infants and lead to sudden death.	1.0240699460935725
We report the diagnostics and surgical treatment in a 15-month-old asymptomatic child and the necessity of surgical repair.	1.245608234875579
The diagnosis was incidentally made during an echocardiographic procedure and confirmed by coronary angiography.	0.9545941203766397
A reimplantation of the ano origin of the coronary artery was carried out wihtout using extra-corporal circulation.	0.9435841361152203
There were no postoperative complications.	0.8648281965682211
Due to the coronary steal phenomenon and the related coronary risk, surgical repair is recommended also for asymptomatic cases.	1.0983025097866628
The surgical management of vesicovaginal fistulae (VVF) is a matter of controversy.	0.9466274407824067
This study deals with our experience with transvaginally treated patients suffering from VVF.	0.8256328158979968
Between 1966 and 1996, 64 patients with VVF were treated surgically.	0.88344917692104
The VVF occurred in the course of hysterectomy in 54 patients, was due to radiotherapy in 7, was a result of obstetric complications in 2 patients, and occurred after colporrhaphy in 1 patient.	1.1591088064427162
In 60 of these 64 patients closure of the fistula was carried out transvaginally.	0.9216838239562307
Fourteen of these 60 patients (23 %) had undergone prior surgical attempts to close the VVF (1 to 3 procedures).	1.0933307383985467
Transvaginal surgery was successful at first attempt in 55 of these 60 patients (92 %).	0.8667970649123075
The other 5 patients were successfully treated by a second procedure (again transvaginal: n = 3; transabdominal: n = 2).	0.9748991897626952
In conclusion, the transvaginal approach to close VVF is of advantage, avoiding an abdominal incision and reducing postoperative morbidity.	0.9581013369686837
In the vast majority of the cases isolated VVF can be treated successfully by transvaginal repair.	1.2332725301228742
Myotonic dystrophy is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder involving muscle, brain, heart, eyes, and endocrine organs.	0.9842159030599674
The underlying mutation is an expanding trinucleotide CTG repeat in the 3'prime untranslated region of a serine-threonine kinase gene on chromosome 19q.	0.7867106380447283
A statistical correlation exists between the CTG copy number and the severity of the disease.	0.7617815613341871
Infants with severe congenital myotonic dystrophy have been shown to have on average a greater amplification of the CTG repeat than is seen in the non-congenital myotonic dystrophy population.	0.9547295456389548
However, not all patients with many CTG copies develop congenital myotonic dystrophy.	1.1412745529700339
We present 13 patients with more than 1500 CTG trinucleotide repeats and show their variable clinical course.	0.8189418861371921
Whilst the incidence of psychiatric disorders decreases during pregnancy, the risk during the postpartum period increases significantly, often leading to the necessity of psychopharmacological intervention during the puerperium, and subsequently during lactation and breast-feeding.	1.1609615693751174
The necessity for lithium prophylaxis in manic-depressive women after childbirth has been identified, and it is recommended that weaning rather than omission of psychopharmacological treatment is preferable during the puerperium.	1.0167178623020838
Objectives Arthrodesis of the Chopart joint.	0.5902146228188822

Elimination of painful functional disturbances and reduced need for custom-made shoes.	0.7817443877613567
In 300 patients with 339 coronary lesions the percent diameter stenosis (%-DS) was assessed both by visual estimation and by digital quantitative coronary angiography (DQCA) by use of an on-line computer workstation.	1.2476810607816675
The decision for coronary angioplasty in the same setting ("prima vista"-PTCA) was based on history, evidence of ischemia and visual estimation of %-DS.	1.3882306711352825
DQCA measurements of the 339 stenoses revealed a normal distribution of lesion severity with a mean of 58.4  +/-  11.3%.	1.1761045026405184
In contrast to DQCA visual estimation led to a bimodal distribution with a nadir at ~55% between two peaks at ~45% and ~75% and a mean of 70.5  +/-  19.6%.	1.2990670770078028
Visual estimation underestimated lesions in the range of 30-55% and overestimated the %-DS between 55-99%.	1.2766013713764635
Visual estimation revealed a %-DS >= 60% in 251 stenoses (74.0%) of the 339 lesions, an estimate that led to subsequent "prima vista"-PTCA.	1.1945376665916547
Conversely, DQCA revealed only 184 stenoses (54.3%) with a %-DS >= 60%; thus, 86 stenoses (25.3%) did not meet the morphologic indication criteria for PTCA.	1.1992066511994468
The bimodal distribution of stenosis severity according to visual analysis with an overestimation of borderline stenosis severity reflects a tendency for "self-referral" of patients for PTCA.	1.1092903736978705
DQCA serves as an objective tool in the decision-making process for PTCA and may reduce "cosmetic" interventions or justify to defer PTCA.	1.0131723306440428
Especially in the selection process for "prima vista"-PTCA DQCA-quantification of stenosis severity is recommended.	0.9248434049593256
S-100 protein and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) serum concentrations serve as markers of cerebral damage in cardiac surgery, neurology, or after head injury.	1.0153157702034303
In these circumstances, S-100 and NSE levels correspond with the results of neuropsychological tests.	0.9266210368057507
The present study investigated the diagnostic value in orthopaedic patients after joint replacement.	1.0641488387050861
Since its introduction in clinical use more than ten years ago, propofol is well appreciated for sedation and supplemental hypnosis in anaesthesia.	0.9388973070139512
However the substance is approved only for anaesthesia in children elder than three years.	0.8191334009807107
As can be substantiated by many data reported in literature, there are no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic reasons whatsoever to withhold propofol from the younger children; this applies both to the use as a narcotic supplement and as a short term hypnotic for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.	1.0470102487057513
Orthostatic circulatory disorders are frequently the cause of orthostatic intolerance, syncope or dangerous falls.	0.8991772004712446
A sufficient therapy should be based on a differential diagnosis by means of an active standing test or a tilt-table test.	1.023970962866527
Three typical pathological reactions of blood pressure and heart rate can be differentiated.	0.8348386122313526
The hypoadrenergic orthostatic hypotension is characterised by an immediate drop in blood pressure (systolic drop >20 mmHg below base line within 3 min) with or without compensatory tachycardia.	1.0243925393294393
It is caused by peripheral or central sympathetic dysfunction.	0.6027286158866912
Tachycardia (>30 beats per minute above base line within 10 min) without significant blood pressure drop but with a fall of cerebral blood flow indicates a postural tachycardia syndrome.	1.151278162414599
In general, there is no further somatic dysfunction.	0.9152639632608608
Increased venous pooling is thought to be the assumed pathomechanism.	0.9821272512067453
A reflex mechanism evokes the neurocardiogenic syncope after a certain time of standing: sympathetic inhibition yields a strong blood pressure drop and vagal activation bradycardia.	0.8503812025064855
Proved therapies include use of the mineralocorticoide fludrocortison (hypoadrenergic orthostatic hypotension), of the a-agonist midodrin (postural tachycardia syndrome) and of b-blockers (neurocardiogenic syncope).	1.2086133508790036
There are numerous diseases which can irreversibly stiffen the whole spine or parts of the axial skeleton.	0.8640737792689768
Due to didactic reasons one can distinguish 3 gropus of such disorders: -  Paradigmatic diseases of the spine with an inherent proneness to stiffness.	1.0681432345559039
-  Rare diseases which involve a certain danger of stiffening the spine.	1.073129075032054
-  Rigidity of the spine due to scientifically unrecognised morphologic phenomena.	1.1854079678910199
Modern approaches in knee endoprosthetics using computer-assisted navigation systems are based on matching procedures which refer to osseous anatomical landmarks.	0.8426953921582
However, surface replacement techniques require a correct position of the implants in relation to the bone, as well as an optimal postoperative interaction of the ligaments and the surface design of the endoprosthesis.	1.1892246724056468
Functional aspects are of elementary importance.	0.6724654642638972
A 79-year-old man died of fatal haemorrhage into the soft tissue of the true pelvis 2 days after transrectal ultrasound-guided prostatic biopsy.	1.0692842482439697
Autopsy revealed a perforation of the left prostatic lobe with ruptures of the periprostatic vessels.	0.8997599060647424
A similar case of transrectal prostatic biopsy-associated complication has not been described previously.	0.9897974385022895
The judicial enquiries were discontinued.	0.41352584155923217
Several different theories exist about the orign of kinetosis and the space adaption syndrome, with individual sensitivities differing significantly.	0.8940649435890266
One explanation involves the hypothesis of a different otolith mass between the right and left statolith organ and especially a difference in the utricles.	0.9901305481047556
A difference in mass results in a different sensitivity to acceleration.	0.9706381517742524
For this reason we measured interindividual variances in saccular and utricular otolith mass.	0.7655292757897431
Since the anatomy of the vestibular organ in vertebrates is based as similar principles, we selected fish (salmon and trout) as our study model to facilitation preparations.	1.0108644209654134
The maximum difference in mass in the saccule was 17% and was generally smaller in the utricle, although in individual cases was much higher.	1.2071514839933188
We assume that a misbalanced sensitivity of the statolith organs occurs but is totally compensated for by the vestibular system as long as physiological motion patterns take place.	0.9126849026433729
Decompensation leads to kinetosis under non-physiological motion patterns.	0.6316598109565535
When the vestibular system is better balanced and has an equally distributed otolith mass to both sides, the possibility for developing kinetosis or space adaption syndrome is much less likely.	1.0264497856232515
The clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of haematogenous multifocal osteomyelitis, a rare illness, are described.	1.090417256426244
Of clinical note are the pain, pseudoparalyses and restriction of movement.	0.633638404503576
Staphylococcus aureus was the pathogen in both of the cases we described.	1.0584399999387277
Sonography is a useful diagnostic tool for the localization of subperiosteal abscesses; scintigraphy is a supplementary examination for cases where it is difficult to establish a diagnosis.	0.9558727540289811
MR-tomography is the most reliable method for examination of proximal infected foci (spondylitis, pelvis osteomyelitis).	0.9207977603671256
In our view, the earliest possible removal of all infected foci by means of operation and parenteral antibiotics mare the most important treatment.	1.100055408308577
Interactions between the endocrine and immune systems are well known with special regard to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.	0.9474649465711615
Little of the literature focuses on the complex effects of cytokines on tissue responsiveness to glucocorticoids (GC).	0.9853974294538971
In bone tissue, osteoblasts represent a valuable model for studying GC-cytokine interactions.	0.8734727886294638
Hence, we have studied two human osteosarcoma cell lines (Saos-2 and MG-63) with different degrees of differentiation and different constitutive IL-6 production (3.4 +/- 0.3 (mean  +/- SE) and 3309 +/- 578 pg/106 cells).	1.2643022369009798
We measured glucocorticoid receptor (GR) number and affinity as a function of the exposure of cells to different amounts of IL-6.	0.9169957489408749
Incubation for 20 h with IL-6 at increasing concentrations up to 2000 pg/ml yielded a significant increase of GR binding sites in both cell lines.	0.9341431863091113
IL-6 was also able to reverse the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone (1 µmol/l) on GR in both cell lines.	1.0711925152949946
In MG-63 cells, expressing higher concentrations of GR, IL-6 deprivation via a specific anti-IL-6 antibody (100 ng/ml) significantly decreased GR.	1.0088104266623876
In Saos-2 cells, expressing lower concentrations of GR, a 40 h treatment with human IL-1 (10 ng/ml) significantly increased both IL-6 production and GR.	1.10807098400506
This latter effect was completely abolished by co-treating the cells with the anti-IL-6 antibody.	0.8700017999338231
Our results provide evidence that IL-6 is an autocrine positive modulator of GR number in human osteoblasts.	0.8840841572507114
Tumor debulking of gastrointestinal tumors for the reduction of tumor mass is intended to improve subsequent treatment efficacy.	0.8710329401376103
However, in advanced malignant disease, this therapy is often associated with increased morbidity and lethality.	1.353354750185194
Adjuvant therapies cannot be initiated when needed.	0.6062468368019035
Therefore, long-term survival remains unaffected.	1.3884112846572654
Advances in biomedical science provide preliminary explanations for these therapeutic problems.	0.7503052274319236
Modern therapeutic concepts like neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced tumors are based on these findings.	0.951265201853243
The probability of complete R0 resections, necessary to improve long-term survival, can be enhanced by these therapies.	1.131205275943071
The ongoing prospective neoadjuvant studies for gastrointestinal tumors are already very encouraging.	0.7740660350422766
The simulation of unilateral deafness is very rare.	0.7650806425312814
Objective findings are of special interest if it happens.	0.9699342558063021
A patient with alleged deafness on the left-hand side due to commotio cerebri was treated in our hospital.	0.850516940058527
Pure tone audiometry showed deafness on the left-hand side and normal hearing on the right-hand side.	0.9326680649531163
However, stapedius reflexes were found ipsilaterally left as well as contralaterally right, at 0.5 to 2 kHz with a stimulation of approxamately 90 dB SPL.	1.2085918584494253
Transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) were measured.	0.9854571453624734
The TEOAE had the same reproducibility but a very low response on both sides, such that inner ear function could not be evaluated.	1.1031285760052207
In comparison, the DP gram showed clear DP amplitudes over the whole frequency range on both sides.	0.9437395429499136
Nonphysiological DPs could be excluded by assessing the DP growth rate at three different frequencies.	0.9215473564104294
By means of brainstem electric response audiometry (BERA), with which the IV/V complex was detectable up to stimulation with 20 dB SPL clicks, and the Stenger test, a neural or central hearing loss could be excluded.	1.120945865898857
Normal hearing on the left-hand side was thus confirmed.	0.7140542745704962
In cases of simulated deafness it is possible to prove a normal inner ear function by DPOAE.	0.9989059806644757
DPOAE therefore complements the list of potential audiological simulation tests.	0.6498301451795437
Controlled studies of adrenal steroids in premenopausal women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have revealed subtle and inconsistent decreases in glucocorticosteroid (GCS) function, but prominent deficiencies of adrenal androgens (AA).	0.9746962308117785
Such findings have suggested that hypoandrogenicity may predispose to RA in younger women.	0.8253856943087176
However, recent prospective studies of serum cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels before (x = 12 yrs) the onset of the disease (pre-RA) offer an alternative perspective.	1.2795913236326173
Significant dissociation of serum cortisol and DHEAS levels was found only in the subgroup of premenopausal women who developed RA before age 50.	0.8397601450246777
This subgroup alone had significant deficiency in serum DHEAS levels.	0.7075837926502758
A growing number of casualties and the increasing restrictions of funding will lead as a consequence to changes within the field of trauma surgery.	1.0232341732312307
Despite these developments trauma surgery must maintain its major responsibility towards the victims of accidents.	0.8165175169252663
Therefore the German Society for Trauma Surgery (DGU) has to face the future economic and social challenges to influence the coming changes.	1.1371529261963649
This role compromises the engagement in a continuous struggle for the high and global standard of injury care in Germany, for quality assessment, education and training, research and adequate public relations.	1.1678589245470639
This paper outlines the aspects and visions of future trauma surgery and the means which may continue to guaranty international acknowledged standard of trauma care in Germany.	0.8917823343452975
Radiofrequency catheter ablation is the treatment of choice in atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia.	1.062230162842106
Electrophysiologic investigations in 623 patients revealed eight mechanisms of tachycardia ablation: Ablation of fast (I) or slow(II), modification of fast (III) or slow AV nodal pathways (IV), modification of both pathways (V), ablation of fast and modification of slow (VI), ablation of slow and modification of fast pathways (VII) and ablation of both pathways (VIII).	1.1131375649922912
The criteria of diagnosis of these eight mechanisms of tachycardia ablation are described.	0.9279361173256013
Follow-up showed fewer relapses in patients with ablation (0-2%) in comparison to patients with modification of a single AV nodal pathway (8-12%).	1.2519871838551706
Alteration of both pathways includes an increasing risk of total AV nodal block, which occured in 7 patients (1.1%).	1.1057000921099154
Detailed analysis of the mechanism of catheter ablation is recommended in all patients after radiofrequency current delivery for AV nodal reentrant tachycardia to estimate the risk of relapsing during follow-up or development of total AV block in the particular patient in case of a further ablation procedure.	1.219459073833996
An increasing life expectancy leads to a higher number of persons aged 70-84 years and persons aged 85 years and older.	0.8422221531063543
Information concerning changes in the spectrum of psychiatric morbidity is rare.	0.8802597579469036
The Berlin Aging Study was based on a representative age- and gender-stratified sample (n = 516) of Berlin citizens aged 70-100 years and older.	1.1797924879537895
In this interdisciplinary study, an intensive investigation was carried out by psychologists, sociologists, internists and psychiatrists.	1.0879043355589801
This report focuses on subjectively reported complaints (Beschwerdeliste, BL), observed psychopathological symptomatology (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, BPRS) and psychiatric diagnoses following the criteria of DSM-III-R (based on the Geriatric Mental State Examination, GMS-A).	1.0003797042458078
On the self-rating scale (BL) 10 % of all persons reported severe subjective complaints, 32 % moderate complaints.	1.0185530083116776
On the BPRS, 17 % showed severe psychopathological symptomatology, 75 % at least mild symptoms.	1.4070698609929069
Following the criteria of DSM-III-R, 23.5 % of all persons had a psychiatric disease, 4.2 % a disease of severe intensity.	1.2601423496152304
When the DSM-III-R diagnoses "Not Otherwise Specified" (NOS) were included 40.4 % of all subjects were diagnosed by the clinical judgement of the psychiatrists to have a psychiatric disease.	1.2194164450806466
The most frequent psychiatric diseases were insomnia (18.8 %), depression NOS (17.8 %) and dementia (13.8 %).	1.1760821015411589
Dementia showed the well-known age-related increase, whereas no other incidences of psychiatric morbidity were age-related.	1.080045971923522
Persons aged 70-84 years did not differ in the investigated psychiatric variables from persons aged 85 years and older, the only exception being the prevalence of dementia.	1.0247353704184543
A first overview concerning developmentary risk factors and protective factors for later psychic and psychosomatic disease is presented.	0.891490074623
Problems within the context of the collection of data and evaluation are discussed.	0.9971224728118705
We analyzed how psoriasis patients sought professional help and correlated it to their illness attitudes and feelings of stigmatization.	0.796231813526422
Semi-structured interviews of 400 patients were reanalyzed to identify homogeneous groups concerning initial reactions at first manifestations of the disease.	0.824493039894222
Four groups ("isolated", "stigmatized", "socially supported" and "non-stigmatized" patients) were found and cross-tabulated with five resulting groups of a second cluster-analysis concerning the "style" of the seeking behaviour of professional and paraprofessional help and medical measures against the psoriasis ("multi-users", "arranged mini-users", "waiting-room patients", "optimists" and "self- therapists").	1.3244905588300846
We were able to describe typical courses of illness behaviour depending on the initial reaction.	0.9258490218130346
The results are discussed with regard to the desirable identification of problematic patients within professional care units.	0.8748630401774271
The sonographic diagnosis of malignant lymphoma in childhood is described.	1.0503622686405487
Malignant lymphomas are sonographically relatively uniform: initial enlargement of the lymph nodes and organs involved and disturbance of normal echo texture by mainly hypoechoic lesions can be found.	0.9064246780659906
Generally, four sonographic patterns of infiltration are described: diffuse, small nodular, large nodular and bulky type.	1.1033490364727263
Secondary, tumor-related or inflammatory complications (e. g. dislocation or compression of vessels, thoracic inlet syndrome, venous thrombosis, ileus, urinary retention, abscess and effusion) can be sonographically evaluated.	1.130855505416571
Response to therapy correlates with normalization of size and echo texture and recovery from tumor-related complications.	0.9593880231453497
Differential diagnosis with ultrasound is based on the topographic distribution and echo pattern of infiltration and, with certain restrictions, on the echogenicity of lesions and perfusion feasible with Doppler sonography.	1.099844690659358
The primary diagnosis has to be established histologically.	0.9654945105190291
The treatment of acute posterior instabilities can involve a reconstructive procedure as well as an antidislocation augmentation.	1.1246209522798474
Tibial bony avulsion ruptures must be reconstructed.	0.5736247397272276
For the treatment of chronic posterior instabilities we used the patella tendon graft, which can be implanted by an anterior or posterior approach.	1.1228727128807563
In cases of posterolateral instabilities, additional procedures are necessary.	0.8826832549449958
Ultrasound of the Achilles tendon is a suitable means of differentiating various diseases of the tendon and the surrounding tissue.	1.006623524778504
Different forms of degenerative disease (tendinitis, peritendinitis or bursitis, fibroosteitis, and Haglund's disease) can be discriminated from rheumatic and metabolic diseases.	0.9355047788554063
Congenital and developmental abnormalities can also be detected.	0.7305183920893722
Tendon degeneration mainly occurs in the ventral part of the medial third of the tendon ("critical zone").	1.2629030763171363
Immature tissue in this area leads to temorary instability of the tendon with a high risk of rupture ("vulnerable phase").	1.2131583926050074
With sonography, lesions of the Achilles tendon are visible early in the course of the disease.	0.7734970923285487
The German social security legislation has recognized only recently the concern of quality assessment in the field of social and medical services.	0.9607268689612944
The legal frame for quality assessment in the field of medical treatment was enacted in the sickness insurance provision (Social Code - Book V) only in 1989.	1.0598015180247764
Quality assessment is considered to be a part of the production of medical services and, therefore, is regulated in the context of providing medical services.	1.0894081745882958
The legal provisions do not establish standards for quality and quality assessment.	0.8132274855404227
Due to the variety of medical services, quality assessment is not regulated in an exhaustive or systematic manner.	1.049312120362579
According to the law, providers of medical services (doctors, hospitals) are bound to participate in quality assessment.	1.0524656412827853
As internal quality assessment prevails in the definition of the various measures of quality assessment and the control of quality in all fields of medical treatment, external quality assessment is also prescribed for hospitals.	1.2399419314707014
Because the establishment of quality assessment is considered to be a part of the service production organization, consumers (patients) or their representatives are not involved in the definition, establishment, and control of quality assessment.	1.1227191910458916
The participation of patients should be provided by law.	0.7303409056552319
Introduction: Because of an increasing number of endoscopic hernia procedures, it is important to look into the possibility of standardizing these techniques helping surgeons to acquire the operative skills necessary.	1.1595408906406612
Material and Methods: To discuss these aspects, the documented data on TAPP operations that have been carried out in this department since 1993 were analyzed.	1.1111367691898943
The results of teaching procedures were compared with those of experts after they had gotten past the learning and development curve.	1.0072672012865886
Results: A total of 778 teaching procedures were performed by 10 surgeons with an individual experience of 30.5 operations (median).	1.1816686443268964
Before starting the first procedure, 89 were done by assistants operating the camera.	0.9066346266387703
The morbidity of teaching operations was 1.9 % compared to 1.4 % for those performed by experts.	1.2113609233147553
After a median follow-up of 23 months there were two recurrences (0.23 %) in the expert group and none in the teaching group (follow-up 16 months).	1.2453933791023972
Conclusion: Because of the potentials of standardization of the TAPP technique, the results of teaching were equal to expert operations.	1.1878947021880288
Therefore, TAPP is suitable for application in a routine setting.	1.1657743997663688
In spite of the high and lasting efficiency of transurethral prostatectomy, intraoperative blood loss results in increased morbidity in this procedure.	1.130860679595026
This led to the development of many alternative treatment modalities in the last years.	1.0124854129246685
To minimize the risk of bleeding, we improved the high-frequency technology in several steps.	1.1119544127782108
To achieve this, the output signals of commercially available high-frequency generators were modulated to the effect that each cut results in an efficient coagulation zone in the tissue at excellent cutting quality.	1.150008797219488
Laboratory and in vitro studies using porcine kidneys as well as clinical trials showed good cutting characteristics accompanied by a significant reduction of bleeding.	1.149428532448327
As a result, blood transfusions were less necessary, the transurethral catheter could be removed earlier in the postoperative period, and hospitalization time was significantly reduced.	1.1301149118257128
In conclusion, the improved high-frequency technology in form of the "coagulating intermittent cutting" results in a blood-sparing tissue resection with a consecutive reduction of morbidity.	1.0838165044183756
An accurate assessment of the duration of the ability to act following fatal poisoning can be of major importance in reconstructing circumstances leading to death, especially in determining whether the poisoning was accidental, self-inflicted, or the result of a criminal act.	1.205842995399434
Clinical publications have scarcely dealt with this problem.	0.6118834899701295
We therefore examined 20 legal autopsies performed at the Institutes of Forensic Medicine of the Universities of Würzburg and Leipzig as well as the respective records of the police and prosecuting attorney's offices in an effort to clarify this question.	0.9648767919440226
As a rule the victims retained the ability to act for 10-15 min.	0.8973571315972184
However, the material we examined and the literature also contain cases in which the ability to act lasted considerably longer.	1.2021188797953315
The present study is intended to provide expert witnesses with guidelines for clarification of cases of fatal intoxication.	1.0974236991587367
Androgenablation is the therapy of choice for the treatment of advanced and metastatic prostate cancer.	0.9139498743108334
However, in more than half of the patients the disease will ultimately progress within 2 years.	1.2594110391303373
Intermittent androgenablation through medical castration maintains the apoptotic potential.	0.6038986730915912
By periodically changing phases on and off treatment the quality of life of the patients is improved.	1.2045760689914167
Apart from reduced toxicity treatment costs are lowered and tumor progression is possibly delayed.	0.8284925353286329
In how far survival is influenced is presently not clear and remains to be evaluated in further clinical trials.	0.9125631656073152
During pressure support ventilation (PSV), the timing of the breathing cycle is mainly controlled by the patient.	1.0849839255226115
Therefore, the delivered flow pattern during PSV might be better synchronised with the patient's demands than during volume-assisted ventilation.	1.1140727351724193
In several modern ventilators, inspiration is terminated when the inspiratory flow decreases to 25% of the initial peak value.	1.027925739758693
However, this timing algorithm might cause premature inspiration termination if the initial peak flow is high.	1.1544464430873358
This could result not only in an increased risk of dyssynchronization between the patient and the ventilator, but also in reduced ventilatory support.	1.241126437802424
On the other hand, a decreased peak flow might inappropriately increase the patient's inspiratory effort.	1.014137735727984
The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of the variation of the initial peak-flow rate during PSV on respiratory pattern and mechanical work of breathing.	1.016679212673109
To date, positron emission tomography (PET) is the most powerful tool for the non-invasive study of biochemical processes.	0.984877250187025
Besides its usefulness for basic research PET has been proven to be superior to conventional diagnostic methods in several clinical indications.	0.9716634432410713
However, the introduction of PET into clinical practice has been hindered considerably by its costs.	1.0659939182832028
Several American studies lend support to the hypothesis that PET may be more cost-effective than the conventional diagnostic work-up - at least for some of its clinical indications.	1.1844612127094984
In Germany, however, this hypothesis has still not been verified.	1.0942330092611827
The rapid growth, development and organ differentiation during early human development depend on an adequate and balanced substrate availability.	0.888684615538951
It is well known that early nutrition has short term effects (e.g.	0.7237891746864852
on growth), and that marked metabolic imbalances in infancy (e.g.	0.8839784562110571
hypoglycaemia, phenylketonuria) have long term effects on child development.	1.0602779265526108
More recent studies indicate that also variations of metabolic conditions within the normal range, which occur during sensitive periods of early human development, may have marked long term effects on later prognosis and disease risks in adulthood.	1.0607849894763735
This metabolic programming was demonstrated in epidemiologic studies indicating close relationships between indicators of early growth and the disease incidence and the mortality of coronary heart disease in late adulthood.	1.0548314291109577
Long term effects of infant feeding on immunological functions are indicated by the effects of infant feeds on later prevalence of allergic disease and by the difference in morbidity for diabetes mellitus, Crohn's disease and malignant lymphoma between previously breast fed and formula fed infants.	1.0632698724148466
An improved understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that modulate these observed long term effects is required to enable effective preventive interventions.	1.0148793314274431
Already the available information indicates a great potential for actively improving long term child health and development by an improved substrate supply during pregnancy and infancy.	0.9293050022444639
Persons who cross international boundaries are at increased risk of contracting infectious diseases.	0.8160365164604
An analysis of the reported communicable diseases in Germany shows: A large number of cases of typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, shigella infections, trichinellosis and brucellosis notified during the last years in Germany originated from foreign countries.	1.0003571363768653
Intervention measures are necessary, above all, with regard to gastrointestinal infections and vaccine-preventable diseases.	0.8956522873902332
Bilateral testicular tumors account for approximately 3,5 % of all testicular malignancies and to our knowlegde about 800 cases are reported in the literature.	1.0207099053719708
An even more seldom event is the appearance of a testicular germ cell tumor with a contralateral benign non-germ cell tumor.	0.9163014601499473
We report the 6th case of such a coincidence.	1.2106011107159973
The dignity of a contralateral tumor should be assured by frozen section and in case of benign histology organ preserving therapy is indicated.	0.838837925964213
Even in cases of bilateral testis cancer tumor enucleation may be considered, if the strict conditions for resection and follow-up are respected.	1.006691622636291
Most sudden cardiac deaths are arrhythmic.	0.6736811137056092
Besides the known effects of beta-blockers, among true antiarrhythmic drugs only amiodarone seemed to reduce total cardiac mortality in patients at risk.	0.8640995320820595
Reevaluation of amiodarone with or without a beta-blocker in primary prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death after review of recent publications.	0.7758618213180482
Only augmentation of case numbers by meta-analyses of controlled trials could demonstrate that amiodarone not only reduces sudden cardiac death but also diminishes total cardiac mortality.	0.9300252824524937
However, the number of avoided sudden deaths is small in comparison to the number of treated cases.	1.1219390962787534
This and specific side effects of amiodarone contradict a general primary prophylaxis with this drug.	0.9983068091398627
An additional benefit by combining amiodarone with beta-blockers seems to exist but has to be proven by further studies.	0.9738788238971545
At present, primary prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death with amiodarone with or without a beta-blocker is an individual decision in all cases with special risk considerations.	0.9423232068849704
As a result of a critical review of the literature and a survey at German epilepsy centers of usual pre- and postoperative drug treatment, the following strategy is recommended:	1.3533690119375608
An ecological theory of remembering is formulated which is based on the patterns of meaningfulness in the social and spatial environment.	0.8730733205303086
The specific ecological relationship to the environment is affinitive, and also opens access to the ressources of the past.	1.0174966680620816
In the present study, conditions for this access (in particular with older people) were investigated.	1.2326639719255108
It is assumed that older people, especially, when they lose someone with whom they had a fixed relationship seek counselling and that abrupt changes in the spatial environment, such as moving to a home, are rejected by older people.	1.1385463395620694
These hypotheses were checked on the basis of material (N=120) gathered in a counselling service for the aged and they were essentially confirmed.	0.9269962451473454
To make matters clear, "typical" and thus every-day experiences of maintenance and loss of competence are cited from the material.	1.0902258300001058
Finally, practical conclusions are drawn with regard to work with the aged.	0.9934307512467458
Following Shouldice repair of a primary inguinal hernia 50 patients were given subcutaneous Redon drains, while another 50 patients underwent operations without drains in a prospective randomized trial.	1.071323703031166
The amount of postoperative wound secretion in the drainage bottle was added to fluid retention established by sonographic volumetric analysis.	0.8454540965147873
The degree of personal impairment was estimated by a visual analogue score.	0.8625658173042616
Inflammation parameters were recorded as well as the rate of complications.	1.2652652545410772
The drain group showed significantly increased fluid production in comparison to the group without drains on the 1st postoperative day (36.0 vs. 2.5 ml).	1.256697105667424
Wound sepsis was found in two patients in the drain group.	1.1276657375780577
Seven patients with drains and eight patients without underwent percutaneous seroma puncture.	0.8022660718894905
The drain only slightly affected personal impairment (25.6 % vs 21.4 %, visual analogue score).	1.2264330028523707
Body temperature was elevated in the drain group on the 3rd day after operation (37.2 vs 36.7  °C).	1.1208605567430319
We believe there is no indication for the routine use of a Redon drain in the repair of a primary inguinal hernia.	1.102133774446274
Instead, percutaneous puncture of subcutaneous fluid retentions should be performed.	0.9690821323545307
We report on three arterial thromboses of the external iliac artery following total hip replacement.	1.0825544915001588
As a result of implanted cement/spongiosa or protrusion of the acetabular component, the iliac vessels were compressed.	1.0721510581914424
Furthermore, we report about one intraoperative arterial vessel lesion in a 65-year-old patient during a revision operation.	1.3985906941771347
We recommend that in case of acute ischemic syndromes of lower limbs following total hip replacement, an angiography should be performed in order to exclude an extravascular cause of thrombosis.	1.1581175933344123
For therapy in those cases extra-anatomic bypasses should be preferred to thrombectomies.	0.8829803715200774
One of the most important occupations of manual therapists is the treatment of hypomobilities of intervertebral joints.	0.9657503616019901
Such hypomobilities of the spine are treated with different kind of manipulations or mobilisations.	1.00664365962624
The pathophysiological basis of hypomobilities is subject of discussion.	0.755769731212952
Objective criteria for the diagnosis of disturbed spinal mobility are missing.	0.8890497117471664
They are not detectable in X-ray, computertomography or NMR.	0.8562351434213377
In this article, we report on a family in which five examined members showed clinical signs of Fechtner syndrome, a condition which consists of hearing loss (49%), macrothrombocytopenia (100%), leukocyte inclusion bodies (100%), eye anomalies (54.3%), and nephritis (38.7%).	1.1437302446628805
This article describes how tissue culture has developed from an observing method to a powerful analytical technique for oncology and for pathological cell changes such as metabolic disorders and degenerative diseas es.	0.9731388968935317
Standard terms are defined and basic methods are explained.	0.768345049073687
Different models of in vitro culture - monolayer, three-dimensional tumor cultures, and organ cultures - are critically reviewed in respect of their significance for the interpret ation of in vivo tissue.	1.1673299448548913
Two important recent extensions of tissue culture, serum-free cell culture and the introduction of genetic material into cells, are described.	1.0233876824098902
The objective of this prospective, randomised study was to investigate the incidence of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting (PONV) during the first 24 h postoperatively.	1.0891887294632854
For a quality assurance study on PONV, we compared two established general anaesthetic procedures in 239 patients undergoing four different types of surgery (subtotal thyroidectomy, laparotomy for gynaecological procedures, laparoscopy, and surgery for extra-abdominal procedures).	1.0367040413015955
The historical opinion that the intima layer of a ruptured artery of muscular type could stop bleeding by "rolling in" should be controlled experimentally.	0.9676190945259944
Five segments of human femoral/popliteal artery (3-4 cm long) were overstretched until complete rupture occured.	1.185971753209271
Furthermore a longitudinally split and a partially oblique incised segment were ruptured.	0.7266772981276179
As morphological findings a sandclock deformity was observed in the region of rupture.	0.9685337691093776
This phenomenon was induced by adventitia layer, which closed the ends of ruptured media layer like a Chinese finger trap.	0.9746320936871599
In the longitudinally split segment a transverse rupture of the media layer could be observed, while the fibers of adventitia layer were pulled out when the traction was continued.	1.0082099548740544
Neither macroscopical nor microscopical signs could be found for "rolling in" of intima or media layer.	0.7355307292317919
The reason for spontaneous hemostasis after arterial rupture is more likely the activation of platelets by collagenous fibers of adventitia layer than "rolling in" of intima or media layer.	0.7913365537237764
If there is no finger trap mechanism of adventitia layer like in shot- or stabwounds a massive blood loss must be expected.	0.9890428891732383
Time and again a lack of staff in the field of people's nursing is discussed (chronic lack of nursing staff); this means that there are not enough people to do the available work) (1).	1.083309698283936
However, the time factor is also an important sociological dimension in old people's stationary care.	1.2070300060294714
First of all, this article points out the time dimension throughout life.	1.1069482909934116
This is followed by people's varying perceptions of the present and the related upsets and misunderstandings.	1.094369082120699
Hereby the contradictory abundance and limitation in time as felt by the elderly also becomes apparent.	0.8668537884885179
The old people's awareness of the dwindling remainder of their own lifespans conflicts with the seemingly endless time of each day that passes.	0.8355168852439475
Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has evolved to a research tool to an intrinsic part of modern invasive cardiology.	0.959596632689852
The main reason is the capability to obtain "in-vivo" micro anatomy by means of miniaturized echo-transducers with an outer diameter of 2.9-3.5 French.	1.152892954321299
For the first time it is possible to base decisions not only on lumenograms but also on vessel wall assessment.	1.2344621445400203
The capabilities of IVUS can be divided in its diagnostic and intervention associated potentials.	0.9594367692309894
The diagnostic strength of IVUS is the ability to monitor compensatory coronary artery enlargement as a response to arteriosclerosis, to assess intermediate lesions, to reveal occult left main stem disease, and angiographically "silent" arteriosclerosis.	1.136941019930491
In conjunction with the estimation of intracoronary flow reserve, patients with the diagnosis of coronary "syndrome X" can be better classified into those with or without early signs of arteriosclerosis.	1.1065448011162051
Additionally, IVUS is at present the only method allowing the classification of coronary artery lesions according to the AHA/ACC Stary classification.	1.138524551979987
Introduction: The chronic exertional compartment syndrome of the musculus tibialis anterior is thought to be responsible for a major part of complaints of the lower leg among active sportsmen.	1.093176244230485
There is an important role of tissue pressure measurement in diagnosing chronic anterior compartment syndrome during muscular activity.	1.211275730423674
However, there is a controversial debate about the relevant parameters.	1.1464169827962463
The development of frontal sinuses following bilateral fronto-orbital advancement is a topic of controversial discussion in the literature.	0.8343671970144665
In a retrospective study on 33 patients (15 girls and 18 boys) the development of the frontal sinus was examined radiologically.	1.1957680980206054
Only patients with a minimum age of 6 years and with at least 1 year of postoperative follow-up were included.	1.2461522861410494
The radiological reference for the frontal sinus development consisted of pneumatisation at or above the level of the supraorbital rims, as projected in postero-anterior cephalograms.	0.9427180534535843
According to these criteria a frontal sinus development was seen in 72.7% of our patients.	1.146556756493088
There was no statistically proven correlation between sinus development and the sex of the patient, age at surgery or the amount of advancement.	1.159043173154339
With the exception of severe cases of Crouzon's disease we usually expect normal development of the frontal sinus following bilateral fronto-orbital correction.	0.9946165607793763
Failures after ankle arthrodesis are, according to the literature and our own experience, more frequently seen with external fixation than with internal fixation methods.	1.1772086787072407
Favourable results can be obtained with the standard four-screw technique, preservation of the ankle and the biomechanical axes seeing only one non-union in 44 own cases with this technique.	1.126272539681151
A vital X-ray imaging technique in oral and craniomaxillofacial surgery is the panoramic X-ray.	0.9831967156045586
Due to its variety of special projections, including imaging of the transversal level and low exposure to radiation, it is suitable for answering many clinical questions and for diagnostics of various findings.	1.1260772598057345
It has become possible to minimize the necessary doses by further development of technology and devices, as well as of X-ray films and by new detection systems, such as sensors or screens.	1.133905054132526
In some clinical cases, the diagnostic deficiencies of conventional imaging techniques make computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging indispensable.	1.0070909693009384
Although MR is particularly suitable for soft tissue imaging, it has also become helpful in finding cortical changes by shorter measuring times.	1.0399233755156438
In certain cases, e. g., changes to bone metabolism, differentiated methods of nuclear medicine make image-aided analysis of function possible.	0.9330915542335552
Secondary haematogenous joint involvement is seen in less than 1 % of patients with Salmonella infections.	1.0537606970953817
These atypical infections are frequently encouraged by pre-existing local or systemic disease.	0.8787643255290337
We present a case of a patient with known alcohol abuse who developed a septic infection of her right hip requiring resection of the femoral head.	1.039687644765072
Histologic analysis showed signs of pre-existing osteonecrosis probably induced by alcohol intake.	0.7694284546067217
Cartilage and bone were invaded and destructed by an aggressive granulation tissue.	0.8297798295835273
Initially, a biopsy evaluated without knowledge of the positive bacteriological result had been interpreted as indicative of a tumour.	0.9727905877851583
The onset, clinical course, diagnosis and therapy of joint involvement by Salmonella are discussed with regard to our case and the relevant literature.	0.9821835388801229
This case illustrates the necessity for clinicians to share all their information about the patient with the pathologist.	0.9312857031183908
There are two types of diabetes mellitus.	0.8093809090635488
Type I, insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM), which becomes manifest before the age of 40, is the result of an absolute deficiency of insulin.	1.1881514854657569
Type II, the non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM), develops in the elderly and is caused by a relative insulin deficiency.	1.0535021173286834
Patients with type-I diabetes are prone to the development of ketoacidosis, while type II causes hyperglycaemic, hyperosmolar, nonketotic coma.	1.0101904526217713
Apart from these acute metabolic alterations, the long-term complications of diabetes are of concern to the anaesthesiologist.	1.0382099090791437
Hypertension, coronary artery disease, renal insufficiency and autonomic neuropathy are common and can result in myocardial ischaemia, cardiovascular instability and gastroparesis, with an increased risk of aspiration.	1.1622384686012857
Limited movement of the atlanto-occipital joint can cause difficult intubation.	0.7780568998358622
To avoid perioperative metabolic catastrophy, blood glucose concentration should be kept between 6.7 and 10 mmol - l-1 (120 - 180 mg - dl-1).	1.2032981731547496
Hypoglycaemia can result in neurological damage, whereas hyperglycaemia causes impaired wound healing and susceptibility to infections and worsens ischaemic damage to the myocardium and brain.	1.032020623061762
Perioperative diabetes management depends on the severity of the surgical procedure and the type of diabetes.	1.0135710833588372
All type-I diabetics, whatever operation being performed, need insulin.	0.9527704246953956
The intravenous route is recommended as it allows better adjustment.	0.9577087336817294
After determination of the fasting blood glucose level, insulin is given at a dosage of 0.5 - 1 U - h-1 (at gluc<11.1 mmol - l-1), 1.5 - 2 U - h-1 (at gluc 11.1 - 16.7 mmol - l-1) or 3  U - h-1 (at gluc>16.7 mmol - l-1).	1.1428058454475918
In addition, 5 - 10 g glucose - h-1 is given.	1.4525480269986046
In type-II diabetes the oral antidiabetic drug is withheld.	0.8305416566668016
During minor surgery the blood glucose concentration is monitored frequently, and if necessary insulin (with gluc>13.9 mmol - l-1) or glucose is given.	1.1615697927143316
In most cases of major surgery insulin therapy will be necessary.	0.9399988606978652
Administration should follow the guidelines listed for type-I diabetes.	0.8335436460486728
Whether the intravenous or the subcutaneous route is used for insulin, repeated glucose determinations are mandatory.	0.9256408811863717
If ketoacidosis develops the volume depletion is treated with normal saline.	0.8480479505809275
For hyperglycaemia and acidosis insulin (3 - 6 U - h-1) with 10 - 20 mmol - h-1 potassium phosphate is given.	1.28263449004651
Bicarbonate is only indicated when the serum pH is lower than 7.1.	1.0216438465648439
It must be borne in mind that perioperative management of diabetes does not end with postanaesthesia care.	0.8280190780220387
At the beginning of the 19 th century, institutional care for the insane was established by the various German states.	0.9045281770040366
At first, the separation of curable and incurable patients influenced psychiatric care and the construction of hospitals.	0.9842473247060937
The combination of care and cure in one hospital in Illenau was a turning point in institutional care.	0.9241470964143041
Contradictory tendencies characterized the second half of the 19 th century: the integration with general medicine in the cities, on the one hand, the social separation and cure in the seclusion of the countryside, on the other.	1.0586586801212838
The characteristic psychiatric construction in different countries was influenced by individual architects.	0.7250327647349792
The following building styles were dominant: in England, panoptic architecture; in the United States, linear staggered structures; in France, the "carrés isolés"; and in Germany, the structure of blocks with cross-axes.	1.173863593002606
At the end of the 19 th century, the system of pavilions was internationally accepted; occupational therapy and mental care in the countryside were introduced.	0.9205772475209469
From the First World War until the end of the 1960 s, a standstill in psychiatric buildings was noted in Germany, and institutional care came under increasing criticism.	1.0507668553389942
There was a reorientation from the middle of the 1970 s as a result of more effective therapeutic possibilities.	1.1063150845400407
A variety of complementary institutions, outpatient and partly inpatient therapies, which were recommended by the "Psychiatrie-Enquête", started to be realized.	1.0727836964974122
Smaller units and different models of integration of psychiatric care, such as building the hospital next to a general hospital or psychiatric wards within a general hospital, became relevant criteria for planning the construction of psychiatric hospitals, as did the integration into the community and the city.	1.1016355996718432
Principles of organization like the construction of a communicative quiet inner room, or grading the rooms from public to private, were structurally integrated.	0.9804583134422261
Specific structural requirements for the construction and design of psychiatric hospitals should be evaluated in more detail by post-occupancy methods.	1.0170478963198324
The coronal incision is a versatile approach to midface or skull base fractures.	0.7399259474057099
It allows the open reduction of complex fracture sites and facilitates canthopexy, marginotomy or calvarian bone harvesting.	0.844499895522504
By this method, primary treatment can be optimised and the rate of secondary corrective surgery can be reduced.	0.9220402269946736
All trauma patients who underwent this kind of intervention were re-examined to check functional and aesthetic results.	0.898450588679856
The complication rate was low and the advantages of these techniques are evident, so that it is suggested that the indication for this operative approach should be extended.	1.0729057897296042
One case of a newly described, rare odontogenic tumor is reported.	1.1697374225626738
A literature review of 19 cases lends support to the odontogenic origin and metastatic capability, both regionally and distantly, of the clear cell odontogenic tumor.	1.140726401248846
We conclude that this tumor is malignant, with a tendency to recur locally after surgery.	1.1859940046072126
It requires an aggressive surgical approach and should be referred to as a clear cell odontogenic carcinoma.	0.9257699967491474
In our patient we saw a clear cell odontogenic carcinoma and a squamous cell carcinoma, both with regional lymph node metastasis.	1.0485592357825606
The histological differentiation of this type of tumor from other clear cell tumors is difficult.	0.8792918192773382
As the elderly segment of our population expands, there is an increase of therapeutic problems considering this age group.	1.0014509103306384
The elderly patient is generally susceptible to infections because of the decline in host defense mechanisms that occurs with aging, and the underlying chronic diseases of these patients.	1.1543837224610576
Increasing numbers of elderly people are being treated in hospitals and are additionally at particular risk of acquiring nosocomial infections with antibiotic-resistant organisms.	0.9627130644989722
This article focuses on the epidemiological considerations, risk factors, types of infections that occur in elderly patients, and the guidelines for empiric therapy.	0.983186090117828
The most common infections of the elderly are respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, and skin and soft tissue infection.	1.1759445001725444
Empirical therapy should be broader in spectrum for elderly patients since the variety of infecting bacteria tends to be greater and the choice of antimicrobial therapy must be based on risk stratification (age, medical illnesses, and severity of presentation).	1.0139749030406817
Many additional aspects, e.g., route of administration, drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, drug toxicity and drug-drug interactions, compliance, and multiple underlying diseases (e.g., renal failure) must be considered in the rational selection of antibiotic regimen.	1.144777376213682
We present long-term results (minimum follow-up 5 years) in 145 patients with advanced non-seminomatous germ cell tumours, who underwent radical retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy (RPLA) after chemotherapy.	1.2683019771440467
We correlated patients' outcomes (death of disease) to different kinds of chemotherapy and to intraoperative findings.	1.0478064150063608
We found that patients who were treated by a modified Einhorn scheme with cisplatin, etoposide and bleomycin have a good prognosis.	0.9641940323503836
In all, 90 % showed no evidence of disease (NED).	1.121839716119259
The NED rate was significantly lower in patients who were treated by sequential alternative chemotherapy (DOD = 37 %).We determined the following prognostic factors which predict a poor outcome:...	1.2315398038328256
Follow-up studies after stent implantation of native coronary arteries have reported reduced rates of angiographic restenosis.	0.9845957217782249
In contrast, stent implantation in the treatment of obstructive disease of coronary artery bypass grafts is complicated by higher restenosis rates.	1.1264657188368747
We sought to determine, if different predictors contribute to the high restenosis rate following stent implantation of coronary artery bypass grafts.	1.195786806046591
We investigated long-term angiographic outcome of 205 stent implantations performed in 177 patients.	0.8987513793254555
Multivariate analysis correlated clinical, procedural and angiographic variables with the incidence of angiographic restenosis defined as diameter stenosis >50% at follow-up.	1.0306518204264987
Angiographic restenosis was observed in 34% of lesions treated.	1.2080513020489636
Multiple logistic regression analysis defined diabetes mellitus (OR 6.89, CI2.41-9.69), graft recanalization (OR 2.69, CI 1.08-6.63), lesion at the aortic anastomosis (OR6.98, CI2.76-19.25), lesion at the coronary anastomosis (OR 2.95, CI1.18-7.49), high diameter stenosis after stent placement (OR 7.01, CI 2.64-15.71), placement of long stents (OR2.78, CI1.11-7.36) and implantation of more than one stent (OR7.34, CI2.08-20.15) as independent predictors of graft in-stent restenosis.	1.2148719812051032
Critical consideration of these variables may help to identify patients who are poor candidates for stent implantation and who may benefit from different interventional approaches.	1.0801165083135906
To compare the conventional 2-D, the simulator-guided semi-3-D and the recently developed CT-guided 3-D brachytherapy treatment planning in the interstitial radiotherapy of breast cancer.	1.0861492556571264
In 103 patients with T1-2, N0-1 breast cancer the tumor bed was clipped during breast conserving surgery.	0.918062194066111
Fifty-two of them received boost brachytherapy after 46 to 50 Gy teletherapy and 51 patients were treated with brachytherapy alone via flexible implant tubes.	0.8936655301098417
Single, double and triple plane implant was used in 6, 89 and 8 cases, respectively.	1.175185892921432
The dose of boost brachytherapy and sole brachytherapy prescribed to dose reference points was 3 times, 4.75 Gy and 7 times 5.2 Gy, respectively.	1.0040447795054483
The positions of dose reference points varied according to the level (2-D, semi-3-D and 3-D) of treatment planning performed.	1.1283212923534907
The treatment planning was based on the 3-D reconstruction of the surgical clips, implant tubes and skin points.	1.120869463847712
In all cases the implantations were planned with a semi-3-D technique aided by simulator.	0.9728559386674925
In 10 cases a recently developed CT-guided 3-D planning system was used.	0.9915983764690831
The semi-3-D and 3-D treatment plans were compared to hypothetical 2-D plans using dose-volume histograms and dose non-uniformity ratios.	0.9880299652059824
The values of mean central dose, mean skin dose, minimal clip dose, proportion of underdosaged clips and mean target surface dose were evaluated.	0.9068464046449631
The accuracy of tumor bed localization and the conformity of planning target volume and treated volume were also analyzed in each technique.	0.9384972316434512
With the help of conformal semi-3-D and 3-D brachytherapy planing we could define reference dose points, active source positions and dwell times individually.	0.8404241326708467
This technique decreased the mean skin dose with 22.2% and reduced the possibility of geographical miss.	1.2071319823599662
We could achieve the best conformity between the planning target volume and the treated volume with the CT-image based 3-D treatment planning, at the cost of worse dose homogeneity.	1.1020543278287085
The mean treated volume was reduced by 25.1% with semi-3-D planning, however, it was increased by 16.2% with 3-D planning, compared to the 2-D planning.	1.323242766637163
The application of clips into the tumor bed and the conformal (semi-3-D and 3-d) planning help to avoid geographical miss.	0.9281733985974029
CT is suitable for 3-D brachytherapy planning.	1.0391715639379986
Better local control with less side effects might be achieved with these new techniques.	1.0132280830651916
Conformal 3-D brachytherapy calls for new treatment planning concepts, taking the irregular 3-D shape of the target volume into account.	1.143168630917101
The routine clinical application of image-based 3-D brachytherapy is a real aim in the very close future.	1.0776971145519811
Background: Staphylococci represent an important source of external infections of the eye.	1.119154195977356
In addition to acute staphylococcal conjunctivitis a spectrum of subacute or chronic disease may be found.	0.8810127261565392
According to Valenton und Okumoto, with this staphylococci-associated blepharo-kerato-conjunctivitis in culture-positive cases S. aureus is found in 31% and S. epidermidis in 69% of smears.	1.2224965552308047
Microbiallergic and toxic mechanisms are the underlying etiology.	0.8438823747300965
Multiple organ failure (MOF) may occur early or late after trauma.	0.8906058427516528
Besides direct physical injury of organs, compromise of the microcirculation by inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of MOF.	0.8145868613668054
Inflammation also induces counterregulatory responses which may end up in immunoparalysis.	0.7178645626958312
As a result, infection and sepsis with additional inflammatory damage to the microcirculation ensue thereby contributing to the late development of MOF.	0.9115177279857819
In addition to this biphasic model of posttraumatic MOF, there is evidence that inflammation and immunoparalysis do not only occur in sequence to each other but in parallel early after surgical procedures.	1.1014448818859786
The aim of the present brief review is to summarize the posttraumatic mechanisms of inflammation and immunoparalysis and to discuss how to differentiate between both pathophysiologic states.	1.099612479762259
Early enteral nutrition is widely accepted for its support of organ structure and function ("gut injury hypothesis") and reduction of infectious complications and hypermetabolism in critically ill postoperative or postinjury patients.	1.1478074729367076
Nineteen severely injured patients (Injury Severity Score 40.3+/-11.6) were studied for the feasibility of early enteral nutrition via a duodenal feeding tube.	1.080479338776881
Despite maxillary fractures, rhinoliquorrhea and blunt abdominal trauma the enteral feeding was mostly started immediately after trauma.	0.7918098816852349
Intermittent diarrhea or constipation resolved after reduction of the feeding rate within 1 or 2 days.	0.9167035297063667
Total enteral nutrition could not be realized in all cases; a central venous line was always additionally necessary.	1.0645338502348345
However, the goal was not complete enteral nutrition but a continuous enteral supply to maintain the integrity of the gut.	1.2250743019159582
The study has shown that early enteral nutrition via a duodenal feeding tube is also feasible in severely injured patients.	0.7258653773256896
The expenditure to overcome the technical and organizational problems seems to be justified.	0.9429389867703193
Enterally fed patients may have a better outcome that those in whom only parenteral is employed.	1.038308494863996
Definition of the problem: The rapid pace of medical progress has drawn renewed attention to the various possible ways of treating dead or brain-dead pregnant women since the 1980's.	1.031995627172159
The discussion today revolves around medical, social, legal and economic aspects.	0.8478857076664125
The historical areas of conflict which surrounded deliveries carried out on dead mothers (usually by means of a Sectio in mortua, nowadays known as a perimortem Caesarean section) and their significance in today's debate are, for the most part, regarded as being of little relevance.	1.1499079126137965
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is one of the most frequent infectious lung diseases in immunocompromised patients, especially in AIDS cases.	1.0719295695535584
The present case report describes pulmonary miliary microcalcifications with and without foreign-body reaction in a patient with successfully treated PCP who was known to have AIDS.	1.073864572283999
This form of residues of completely healed PCP tends to be rare.	0.7473316009176317
Other infectious granulomas, foreign-body granulomas and sarcoidosis must be differentially diagnosed.	0.8221211420856983
After cautious decalcification, pneumocysts can be demonstrated with methamine silver (Grocott).	0.8148245972292925
It is important to be aware that PCP can also undergo spontaneous cure, so that miliary microcalcifications may then be the sole pointer to the presence of AIDS.	1.0598239468197466
Background: In congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency high pre- and postnatal androgen levels are present and might influence psychosexual and psychosocial development in affected girls.	1.02482865223824
Methods: In order to study the impact of high androgen levels as well as chronic medication and repeated surgery on female patients life we performed a comprehensive quality-of-life study.	1.0220927788649952
We report on the results obtained by structured interviews of adult patients (45) and their mothers (35) covering difficulties and problems in general, most aspects of their medical histology, self image, body image and current life with or without a male or female partner.	1.3365096460724937
Results: The patients were socially competent with a well developed social network.	1.1445441011885424
However, regarding sexual contacts they were shy and reluctant.	1.1916145468641381
These resulted in significantly less patients live with a partner or are married.	0.7647704628623879
Existing partnerships were more stable and satisfactory than in the control population.	1.0974678545560879
The incidence of homosexuality was not increased.	0.7005696565061621
The number of women having children was significantly reduced.	0.8071798238776229
A substantial number of women suffered from androgen-dependent problems like irrgular menses and hirsutism.	0.780576500117613
Mothers and patients denied any sex-specific eduction, but the girls had preferred boy-specific toys and competitive outdoor games.	1.0235138822269763
However, school performance was average and comparable to the controls.	1.3166434783350636
Most mothers expressed problems and questions regarding their daughters intersexuality at birth.	0.7057863816676438
Even though they felt they had received good medical treatment, mothers as well as patients felt they would have needed more psychological help.	0.9215435371889538
Conclusions: It seems that adult female patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia are able to adapt to their impairment and chronic disease.	1.1621446217923213
Problems regarding partnership, sexuality, and fertility remain and have to be addressed.	0.9973897232085169
Introduction: Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) has become an accepted treatment for end-stage liver disease.	1.0528020781814162
However, postoperative complications result in significant patient morbidity and mortality.	1.2771516577658462
Early detection and treatment of these complications is therefore of utmost importance.	1.022575336014639
Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the postoperative complications of the patients who underwent OLT at our institution.	1.2811598565956626
Duplex Doppler sonography and cholangiography were the primary imaging modalities in postoperative evaluation of the transplanted liver.	1.1157349764020577
Other important techniques were CT, MRI, and angiography, which may contribute to a reliable diagnosis of vascular or biliary complications.	1.1711306985256071
Results: Second to primary organ dysfunction, vascular complications are the most frequent cause of graft loss.	1.2042440570669588
Thrombosis of the hepatic artery is the most common and most serious vascular complication, with a reported incidence from 4 to 42 %.	1.185878875941803
Bile duct sludge, leaks and strictures are frequent complications after liver transplantation, which can contribute to graft dysfunction.	1.0664818873580102
Biliary tract complications usually occur within the first 3 months and require interventional radiological or surgical therapy.	0.9843667831500699
Since liver transplant recipients undergo immunosuppressive therapy, they are at increased risk of developing late post-transplant malignancies, which are best depicted by US, CT or MRI.	1.1406304746233533
However, radiological diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disorder has to be confirmed by liver biopsy.	1.3418139476054642
Conclusion: Cholangiography and Duplex sonography are routinely used in the postoperative evaluation of patients with OLT.	1.2691011861063375
CT, MRI, and angiography are problem-solving tools in equivocal cases.	0.9465829924933158
Recurrence of colorectal carcinomas occurs in about 50 % of the cases with localized neoplasia.	1.127219470549236
It is understood that the tumor recurrence is due to residual micrometastases not found during surgery or extraregional (peripheral blood or bone marrow).	0.9776980962601998
We developed a procedure to detect non-visible, abdominal metastases using a radiolabeled anti-tumor cell antibody injected before the operation (radioimmunoguided surgery, RIGS).	0.9642517417402706
However, even with the best technique, it is not possible to remove all micrometastasis if a hematogenic dissemination happens.	1.3563688281652093
Based on the knowledge of disturbing humoral immune reaction is mounted against shed tumor associated antigens (TAA), we developed a new method to reduce and correct the B cell response and B cell recruitment due to chronic TAA immun complex presentation on follicular dendritic cells (immune corrective surgery, ICS).	1.016928185611255
This method is based on a selective lymphadenectomy.	1.118989539608593
The target lymph nodes were those loaded with TAA-immune complex.	0.7999207442072984
The detection method used was the injection of radiolabeled antibody able to recognize the immune complex.	0.8590289694023872
From 20 patients (stage I, II and III) treated with ICS, 17 survived more than 5 years ' showing a statistically significant increase of survival compared to patients treated with standard procedures.	1.161374915927094
In conclusion, these data show that surgery of colorectal cancer should be selectively extended to specific anatomical regions in order to remove hidden micrometastases, and more importantly, correct postoperative immune processes that could suppress the T cell response against residual tumor cells.	1.1712025307112985
Knowledge of normal and impaired pulmonary gas exchange is essential to the anaesthesiologist.	0.9570622484337574
Analysis of an arterial blood sample allows evaluation of whether or not pulmonary gas exchange is normal.	0.9202329927267373
For this purpose comparison with the oxygenation index or the alveolar-arterial PO2 difference is helpful.	1.0856550095655972
Pathological changes of these variables are mainly caused by ventilation-perfusion (V.A/Q.)	0.9281574786281422
In daily practice, venous admixture or intrapulmonary shunt can be calculated using arterial and mixed-venous blood.	1.0222236918780017
By analysing arterial and expired PCO2, dead-space ventilation can be determined, but extended analyses of V.A/Q.	0.8740216727980212
distribution are not possible in daily practice.	0.9278259690128887
However, knowledge of the principles of typical disturbances of pulmonary gas exchange in acute and chronic lung disease allows the use of therapeutic strategies based on the pathophysiological changes.	1.2039239716088717
Background: Infectious endocarditis can lead to embolic arterial retinal occlusions.	1.0974509135594603
The case of a 30 year old man with acatalasemia is presented.	1.0521560997422337
The congenital disorder  is charaterized by a lack or major reduction of catalase, an enzyme that catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water.	0.9155394018832794
The defect is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion.	0.7591477960726675
Occasionally the defect manifests as progressive oral gangrene or Takahara's, disease.	0.6884199632859169
Poor longterm success has been reported for penile vein ligation the last few years.	0.9177788338720129
Therefore, we decided to re-investigate our group of 147 patients who were operated on between 1987 and 1996.	1.0983285929381918
All patients showed a negative response to intracavernous injection therapy at the time of diagnosis and revealed a maintenance flow > 15 ml/min, as well as a pathological venous flow with pharmacocavernosometry or pharmacocavernosography.	1.0914910197884864
These patients underwent ligation of all superficial dorsal veins and resection of the deep dorsal vein of the penis.	0.9151030938692581
An up-to-date record of the success of the operation was kept either by a renewed clinical visit or by a standardized telephone interview or questionnaire.	1.0768520540407893
A total of 126 patients were available here for long-term follow-up.	0.9217824209622151
We divided the findings into three groups: complete spontaneous erection, postoperative response to cavernous auto-injection therapy and no changes in erectile competency postoperatively.	0.900399334753626
The short-term success rate for these groups after 1-3 months was an outcome of 31 (24.6 %), 25 (19.8 %) and 70 (55.6 %) patients; 86 % of the cases whose results deteriorated after the initial operation success rate had this happen within the first postoperative year (p K 0.001).	1.2921324791248072
Favorable prognostic factors were preoperative erectile dysfunction of K 7 years, a normal CC-EMG and a maintenance flow of K 45 ml/min.	0.9580405810679425
If all three parameters were present, the long-term success rate (spontaneous erection plus response to intracavernous injection) of 30 % of all patients was found to rise to 67 % in this selected group of patients (p K 0.001).	1.2504711568820368
This study reveals that long-term success for unselected patients undergoing penile venous surgery is disappointing; however, careful selection of patients by certain prognostic factors can improve long-term results.	1.1441427367729458
Pyoderma gangraenosum can cause great therapeutic problems.	0.6069428651790733
High dosed corticosteroids are the treatment of choice.	0.792471673871125
However, recalcitrant pyoderma gangraenosum or side effects from corticosteroid treatment may require therapeutic alternatives.	1.0545150216583077
Pyoderma gangraenosum responds excellently to treatment with cyclosporine A.	0.6495523538381718
Because of side effects and drug interactions, the patients must be selected and carefully and closely monitored.	1.17937274197281
Six patients with pyoderma gangraenosum, unresponsive to various topical and systemic therapies, were treated with oral cyclosporine A at mean daily doses of approximately 3 mg/kg.	0.9761022558267193
Marked improvement of the skin lesions and complete healing occurred in all patients over a period of 3-6 months.	1.3758455398804599
Only one patient suffered a relapse after discontinuation of the treatment.	0.9570914542060701
No severe irreversible side effects occurred.	0.631511831279898
The results show that low-dose cyclosporine A treatment can be considered a first-line treatment of pyoderma gangraenosum.	1.186012740551148
Medical treatment of injured patients by international missions of non-governmental organisations in crisis areas and out-of-area operations by troops, and also national disasters require special trauma management.	0.9806490874279787
Deviations from peacetime surgical guidelines are obligatory because of long-distance medical evacuation, the possibility of gaps in supply and the typical pattern of war injuries.	0.9607258564622881
Massive contamination combined with the high risk of infection is one typical attribute of wounds inflicted during a war or a disaster.	1.1050813813828757
In contrast to peacetime surgical guidelines, aggressive wound débridement is often needed.	0.9602011517926013
Timely and prophylactically prescription of a broad-spectrum antibiotic with a long half-life has great importance in the treatment of these wounds.	0.9554454207373817
Suitable antibiotics for these indications are: piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftriazon.	0.7129016339891338
Nevertheless the use of antimicrobial agents will only be effective with early surgical débridement.	0.904763657273343
Craniofacial development may be potentially implicated after vault corrections in cases of craniosynostosis.	0.7653736353560401
The aim of this prospective study was the investigation of the surgical effect on calvaria growth, correlating the percentiles of a group of patients before and after craniosynostosis correction in relation to the normal percentiles of growth.	1.0701962145213972
The patient population consisted of 71 children; the postoperative follow-up time in 57 patients was more than 12 months.	1.1667091792677273
Of the children followed up, 36 were male and 21 female.	1.1938776567104483
Thirty-six cases involved untreated non-syndromic craniosynostosis; the remaining 21 were syndrome cases.	1.0594142402017035
The patient ages ranged from 16 to 27 months.	0.6393041054681883
In 11 cases correction of an occipital craniosynostosis was carried out.	0.8558907973160051
The fronto-occipital circumference was registered in accordance with Prader's percentile table.	0.8213017084735551
The operative method included a fronto-parietal craniotomy, the temporary removal and shaping of the fronto-orbital band and a vault cranioplasty.	1.025036529243532
During follow-up 13 patients treated with fronto-orbital advancement in cases of isolated craniosynostosis remained in the registered percentile curve.	0.9770566990341009
In 13 patients a change to a lower percentile curve was confirmed; 1 patient changed to a higher curve.	1.1783994501521664
In cases of syndromic craniosynostosis 10 patients remained in the post-operatively registered percentile curve; 8 patients changed to a lower and 1 patient to a higher percentile curve.	1.066332622032991
No growth restriction of the reshaped calvaria after surgical correction of craniosynostosis was observed.	0.8300756148269126
No significant difference was found in the potential calvaria growth between syndromic and isolated craniosynostosis.	1.1214598500034447
Today a large number of operative procedures on retroperitoneal organs can be performed using minimally invasive techniques.	0.9298928243431133
The retroperitoneal space can be reached laparoscopically through the peritoneal cavity or by the direct retroperitoneoscopic approach.	0.9763006364027979
The correct anatomical placement of the first trocar is of particular importance in procedures with the patient in lateral decubitus position in order to avoid injuries.	1.1697718694251173
The overview is worse than in conventional surgery because of the magnifying effect of the laparoscope, which is, furthermore, positioned very close to the operative field.	1.2526297145284226
It is therefore of great importance for the surgeon to use anatomical structures for orientation.	1.0809459941953492
The decisive anatomical aspects and landmarks in different minimally invasive operations on retroperitoneal organs are outlined.	0.8087816358300278
Lipid peroxidation is considered a prominent feature of age-related retinal degeneration.	0.9218639758519822
It is known that lipid peroxides can oxidize benzidine.	0.7009249612141707
This property was used to localize lipid peroxides ultrastructurally in the retina.	0.8070590521040788
In a 73 year-old male patient with generalized atherosclerosis, known infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, renal artery stenosis, and coronary artery disease, an aneurysm of the proximal left subclavian artery was successfully excluded by implantation of a JOSTENTTM-Peripheral stent graft.	1.1630530529343654
Angiographic follow up after 6 and 12 months showed an excellent outcome with complete exclusion of the aneurysm.	1.0548662785298755
Intravascular ultrasound showed no neo-intimal hyperplasia within the stent.	0.66689856026115
A computed tomography revealed complete thrombosis of the aneurysm.	0.793047456243265
Based upon our increasing knowledge of mechanisms underlying tissue destruction in RA patients, new therapeutic principles have been developed, aimed at blocking proinflammatory cytokines or using antiinflammatory cytokines.	0.9527587649647026
Both principles, however, have proven to be very effective.	1.220305292433343
In addition, the availability of the methodology to transduce cells with genes has initiated first experiments in animal models to test whether gene therapy for arthritis is suitable, followed by a first, very carefully formulated protocol for human RA.	1.0770696852307728
Gene therapy for RA has to still be considered as an experimental form of therapy in a very early stage, not allowing even now any serious treatment offer to RA patients.	1.166685688628736
Several problems, such as the question of a suitable vector system have not yet been solved.	1.130609620921319
With more experiments this therapeutic principle might become available and might prove effective even in a disease with a systemic character like RA in the coming years.	0.9660253401939347
In the case of typical whiplash after low- energy rear-end collision we recommend a clear and structured therapeutic regimen to overcome and prevent neuromuscular deficits.	1.0562251969410754

The news of success in ether anesthesia on 16 October 1846 in Boston spread like wildfire through Europe.	0.7199839807590591
In the German-speaking countries, the national newspapers as conveyers of the development played a prominent role; this was especially the case for the Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung whose correspondent, Aloys Martin [1], was a medical professional.	1.1749862814175056
The function of local newspapers has not yet been investigated.	0.8985096634615207
This was to be remedied by examining both of Bamberg's local papers.	0.8368285704069611
All issues from 01.01. to 31.04.1847 were surveyed with respect to relevant announcements.	0.994573978940894
These were then catalogued according to date, extent and contents.	0.9169061331708368
Starting on 22.01.1847, the events outside of and in Bamberg were reported on in 26 notices and articles of just a few lines to half a page and in advertisements; Aloys Martin also appears on the scene.	1.001036449321031
Thus, the local press in Bamberg also informed its readers early and regularly on the discovery of ether and the succeeding events.	1.0000266780895322
True arterial aneurysms of the infrapopliteal vessels are a rare finding.	0.7660819445059626
During surgical treatment of convergent aneurysms of the popliteal artery and the tibiofibular trunk we discovered a complete spontaneous rupture of the thrombotic aneurysm of the right tibiofibular trunk.	1.0512940397546129
We describe the special features of diagnosis, histology, and the surgical treatment of aneurysms of the crural arteries.	1.203800331053862
We recommend that even asymptomatic aneurysms be electively operated on to prevent further complications.	0.9428632079259116
Dementia is going to be one of the major challenges of the next century for our societies due to the enormous burden on the health care systems.	1.008820883837415
Dementia is the major cause of death and the most important risk factor for disability and entry into a nursing home in elderly people.	1.087610967643002
Moreover, because of the progress in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, in particular with the cholinesterase inhibitors, demented people will be more often and detected earlier by general practitioners and families.	1.1564353347934133
Nowadays operative sperm retrieval in connection with assisted reproduction is a well-established procedure in urological-gynecological cooperative groups.	0.8991586572754954
Microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration (MESA) and testicular sperm extraction (TESE) are the fundamental procedures in cases of non-reconstructable obstructive azoospermia or testicular azoospermia.	1.0238065419564781
As they are often favored percutaneous techniques such as percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration (PESA) or percutaneous testicular sperm extraction (PTESE), need to be in Anglo-American countries and the countries of northern Europe, discussed regarding their efficacy (number of retrieved spermatozoa) and possible testicular injury due to blind or ultrasound-guided puncture.	1.0352813705443498
In Middle Franconia, one of the larger Bavarian administrative division (population 1994: 1,657,101), the number of patients suffering from cancer pain, chronic headache and chronic back pain is not known.	1.1499986414112724
Furthermore, there are no data on interdisciplinary organization of outpatient pain management.	1.2197069596162569
A 34-year-old HIV-infected African woman developed fever, weight loss and widespread papules on her trunk, arms and face.	1.009351586731838
Skin biopsy and culture revealed histoplasmosis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum varietas capsulatum (American histoplasmosis).	0.7442533836548042
Even though antimycotic treatment and intensive care were started immediately the patient died because of the systemic mycosis within a few days.	1.0833555826090473
Histoplasmosis is a rare disease in Europe but endemic in some areas of the USA (e.g.	0.9094595193723258
Ohio, Mississippi) and of Africa.	1.166935023630557
Additionally histoplasma capsulatum varietas duboisii is endemic in Central and South Africa.	0.7167243507564067
As a consequence of scientific advances, an increasing number of patients with advanced age, reduced myocardial performance, previous cardiac surgery, comorbidities, and emergency indications are referred for cardiac surgery.	1.1847982538790076
This requires risk stratification to predict "low", "moderate", and "high" operative risk.	1.231403291188198
Risk factors can be divided into pre-, intra-, and postoperative patient-, structure-, and procedure-related.	1.4710874131770049
On the basis of this risk prediction, the perioperative course can be optimized by an individually tailored multiprofessional and interdisciplinary management.	1.1281946018349442
Unnoticed, minor damage to the unidirectional respiratory valves of the Draeger respiratory circuit may lead to intermittent and unpredictable malfunction, resulting in rebreathing and hypercapnia.	0.8991893544015663
The damage may be so minor that normal visual and functional test routines may be insufficient to detect it.	0.8381808713577119
We report one case of a potential life-threatening malfunction of the inspiratory valve and also propose economical solutions utilizing altered construction, modified machine-check procedures, or a simple instrument that adds only one step to the machine-check procedure.	1.0966327391762536
The general problem of minor but functionally important damage to parts of ventilatory equipment - so-called borderline damage - may not be limited to this particular model or manufacturer.	1.0564208936265007
Most users of ventilatory equipment believe that equipment that goes through normal check procedures is either fully functional or non-functional.	0.8040282667934742
In reality, this is not the case.	1.456285901831624
Intermittent malfunctions due to slightly damaged equipment may be missed with normal machine-check procedures.	0.835793011600465
This problem results in a significant but incalculable increased in risk to patients.	0.9079310182313456
Because of unclear reproduceability of intermittent malfunctions caused by borderline damage, there also is an increased forensic risk for the anaesthesiologist.	1.1023687948790022
The risk of mechanical malfunction might be displaced by software problems in new-generation ventilators in the market.	0.8233402004350421
Purpose: To investigate whether the margins of microscopic tumors can be delineated better with monocrystalline iron oxide nanoparticles (MION), a superparamagnetic contrast medium, than with Gd-DTPA by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).	0.9175948640958449
Nonunion of the ankle malleoli is extremely rare these days.	1.033274301525263
This is probably due to the fact that primary osteosynthesis is performed in ankle fractures instead of the conservative treatment given up to 20 years ago.	1.051652884314327
Today nonunions of the malleoli are seen, if at all, is infected cases after surgical procedures.	1.156178621651767
Noninfected, stable and painless nonunions usually do not need any surgical correction.	0.8200127530019697
In painful cases, small fragments, especially of the medial malleolus, should be resected; larger fragments should be stabilized with two 3.5-mm cancellous screws.	1.2102966766782801
Alternatively, the tension banding technique, especially after Weber A fracture, produces high compression in the area of nonunion.	1.098870140848812
In cases of additional bony defects, a local upside down cortical-cancellous bone graft should be performed in addition.	1.1025144020122974
In summary, the therapeutic approach requires exact remodeling, bone-grafting and stabilization.	1.1902361950674196
Infected nonunions with loss of bone mass should be treated according to the guidelines for osteitis therapy.	1.0631824097774931
This study investigated the influence of the patients' educational level on indication for and duration of psychotherapy and the choice of treatment methods (psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy or psychoanalysis).	1.1398718069296039
We considered treatments that were conducted within the framework of the statutory health insurance in Germany.	0.7588883616465538
Data were collected from the therapists' case history (n=274), submitted to the first author as an expert of the statutory health insurance companies.	1.0231888041646806
We found a significant relationship between level of education and indication for psychotherapy.	0.9666403183524549
In our sample 43.5% had graduated from senior high school compared with 25.1% in the average German population.	1.05709720220383
This relationship is getting more clear if we discriminate between psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy and psychoanalysis.	0.7736043765368157
51.7% of the patients undergoing psychoanalysis had graduated from senior high school and only 13.2% from junior high school compared with 48.7% in the average German population.	1.1142828701251517
Also the duration of psychotherapy depends only on the level of education, not on gender, age or type of statutory health insurance.	1.2125418949097284
These results are discussed carefully and questions for further investigations are deduced.	1.0083186063857181
After the initial enthusiasm subsided lasercoagulation of the prostate has been criticized because the extent of tissue destruction cannot be controlled and many patients may be expected to have significant postoperative obstructive as well as irritative voiding symptoms which may last for weeks.	1.1213947279684844
Thanks to new laservaporization techniques these disadvantages have been largely eliminated.	0.7350658330996466
With the Holmium laser a real resection of prostatic tissue is possible allowing the surgeon to see the prostatectomy defect immediately and to assess tissue destruction during the operation ("what you see is what you get").	1.0339990384131454
The postoperative voiding disturbances are diminished and comparable to those after TUR-P.	0.8406421716137569
The classification of acetabular fractures and especially the diagnosis of additional lesions can be misleading, when the personal experience is limited and the decisions are based only on conventional radiographs.	1.0885213358677752
The introduction of Spiral-CT with multiplanar reformations and 3-D views has improved the quality of visualization.	0.9891993182550671
Due to their higher costs, the need of these additional diagnostic tools is frequently questioned.	1.0821548752325714
This paper discusses the relevance of plain radiographs, 2-D-CTs, 3-D-CTs and Femursubtraction-CTs (FsCT) for the classification of acetabular fractures, based on a controlled study.	1.102205438600198
Methods: Thirty physicians with different levels of experience in acetabular surgery were divided in three groups of 10 each: group I comprised residents without operative experience in acetabular surgery, group II was physicians with 3-10 years of operative experience, and group III was experts in acetabular surgery.	1.2552495786265037
A total of 10 complete radiographic cases of high quality providing all levels of preoperative diagnostics (plain radiographs, 2-D-CT, CT with multiplanar reformation, 3-D-CT, Fs-CT) of different acetabular fracture types were prepared.	1.1532251074072877
The task for each candidate was to classify the fracture according to Letournel and to identify all additional injuries within the hip joint (e. g. marginal impaction, head fractures, etc.).	0.9200807895023663
The different diagnostic "levels" could be ordered stepwise according to personal need and no time limit was given.	0.95379707094298
The case was finished when the candidate presented his final diagnosis.	0.7387358461913566
The use of the different radiographs, the preliminary diagnosis, the changes in diagnosis, and the final decisions were recorded.	1.4448351223669866
These findings were correlated with the different levels of experience and against a "consensus classification" which was generated by thorough discussion, and the use of intraoperative information and postoperative radiographs not accessible to the candidates.	1.2601526199408264
Results: The "correct" fracture classification based on plain radiographs was: group I, 11 %; group II, 32 %; group III, 61 %.	1.176849552369718
Based on 2-D-CT a "correct" diagnosis was reached by 30 % in group I, by 55 % in group II, and by 76 % in group III.	1.3410074358690844
With consideration of the "transient forms" in acetabular fractures based on Letournel and the 3-D-CT used mainly by group I, the rate of "correct" classifications rose to 65 % in group I, 64 % in group II and 83 % in group III.	1.1420202041322645
The modifiers were diagnosed "correctly" in group I by 37 %, in group II by 56 %, and in group III by 73 %.	1.377018696975255
The use of the 3-D-CT and especially the Fs-CT by group I resulted in an improvement in the rate of correct classifications to 61 %, whereas in group II the Fs-Ct was used only exceptionally.	1.2292883862438293
The 2-D-CT was the basis for the diagnosis of the additional lesions in acetabular fractures within all groups resulting in 73 % complete diagnoses in group III.	1.245903321617709
This study showed the importance of CT for the exact analysis and classification of acetabular fractures.	0.8856871448609772
In particular, the secondary reformations in CT and the 3-D-views dramatically improved the rate of "correct" classifications in the group of surgeons with limited personal experience in acetabular surgery.	1.0361607007222031
This allows the less experienced an acceptable level of "correct" diagnoses, so that the treatment options can be weighed correctly.	1.0120025996648763
Among the "experts" a rate of divergent classifcations of approximately 20 % was observed, especially in "transient" forms of acetabular fractures.	1.2005761242895938
Background: Iridodonesis is the clinical sign of lens subluxation.	1.1603973387813156
Acute glaucoma caused by a ciliolenticular block may develop.	0.7156904324710525
YAG iridotomy or peripheral iridectomy are rarely effective in controlling intraocular pressure.	0.7269576839790284
The results of phacoemulsification and posterior lens implantation for subluxated lens and glaucoma are reported.	0.7999075174903484
Cerebral perfusion reserve may be determined by assessing changes in cerebral blood flow using vasodilators.	0.8571588980552692
Transcranial Doppler (TCD) may be used to measure cerebral blood flow speed in response to such stimuli.	1.1389917337413469
The aim of this study was to analyze cerebral vasoreactivity in patients with high-grade carotid stenosis and to determine the short- and long-term effects of desobliteration.	1.0878357998865873
A total of 40 patients had bilateral preoperative studies done and 24 were re-evaluated 1 year later.	0.9388790728151358
The preoperative vasomotor capacity using TCD with CO2 was 57% +/- 45.	0.740387835713908
Hemodynamic reserve did not decrease significantly in the early postoperative period on the operated hemisphere, and 1 year later hemodynamic reserve had increased to to 102% +/- 80%.	1.129355603087379
One year later patients with unilateral stenosis (n=11) presented with a restitution of reactivity to 65% +/- 46% after initial postoperative ipsilateral decrease from 51% +/- 35% to 48% +/- 38%.	0.9083286791632713
Patients with bilateral stenoses (n=9) demonstrated an initial decrease from 70% +/- 60% to 48% +/- 21% and a significant rise to 115% +/- 77% 1 year later (P=0.02).	1.0442162187091437
Both the significant postoperative increase in the cerebral vasomotor capacity in patients with bilateral carotid stenoses registered in both hemispheres and long-term improvement in patients with unilateral stenosis underline the effectivity of carotid desobliteration in antiembolic prophylaxis and in cerebral blood flow increase, irrespective of the symptomatology.	0.9785343637674249
Chronic constipation can be divided in two large groups: slow-transit constipation, caused by pathological intestinal transit, and obstructive defecation disorder, caused by pelvic and rectal wall abnormalities.	0.9899951018232078
Videodefecography and defecoflowmetry are methods used to study dynamic evacuation of the rectum.	0.8037745346337439
Videodefecography also enables visual estimation of rectal evacuation.	0.7372865284228681
Defecoflowmetry allows analysis of anal and rectal pressures.	0.6866496444359398
Within this prospective study we utilized and compared these methods in 19 patients with slow transit and 30 patients with obstructive disease.	1.1379246513360408
In patients with slow transit, both investigations demonstrated a significantly higher defecation rate than in obstructive defecation disorder (slow transit: defecoflowmetry 65 %, videodefecography 80 %; obstructive defecation disorder: 50 % and 58 %).	1.1313502208762403
The evacuation time was pathologically prolonged in both types of constipation, with a range of 43-55 s. Rectoceles are demonstrated in 94 % of cases with slow transit and in 72 % with obstructive defecation disorder.	1.2641308255494363
Also, we often found obstructive components in slow-transit constipation patients.	1.103827044338015
Normal defecography or defecoflowmetry can rule out obstructive defecation disorder.	0.5711916903967179
We conclude that videodefecography and defecoflowmetry are important items in the complex diagnostic regimen needed in evaluation of chronic constipation.	1.0821412924536074
Absence of the septum pellucidum is a rare developmental disorder of the human brain.	1.1450276549318272
Previous reports focused on the association with other cerebral anomalies.	0.8741523122101499
We present MRI scans showing an isolated absence of the septum pellucidum.	0.803418470294683
The patient was suffering from a schizophrenic psychosis.	1.0162701570708599
Mental retardation or epileptic seizures, which are often found in more complex developmental brain disorders, were not observed.	1.2077554075022698
The septal area is part of the limbic system and aplasia of the septum pellucidum could indicate developmental anomalies of the limbic system.	0.7580752093265993
The concept of cerebral maldevelopment and the limbic system in schizophrenic psychosis is discussed.	0.8771651496912114
History and clinical findings: A 61 year old man presented with newly developed tachyarrhythmia.	1.1524902884628887
Echocardiographically a tumour of unclear origin in the left atrium was diagnosed.	0.9769600891262916
Investigations: The heart rate in the ECG was arrhythmic at 146/min; intermittently sinus rhythm was established.	0.9571992978875068
Transoesophageal echocardiography revealed a 90x50 mm tumour with sharp borders displacing both atria.	0.7141538138320659
The chest x-ray showed a mediastinal rounded mass in the dorsal part overlapping the right mediastinal border.	0.9084378068310448
Computer tomography was unable to discriminate the atrial wall from the tumour masses; hence the difference between an (intra-)cardiac tumour (i.e.	1.0035538536664712
myxoma) and a tumour of extracardiac (mediastinal) origin could not be established.	1.1448069852979785
Additional magnetic resonance tomography led to the most probable diagnosis of a bronchogenic cyst, which spread ventrally up to the ascending aorta and dorsally to the paravertebral region, thus displacing and shrinking the left pulmonary artery and the left atrium.	1.290313993440491
Therapy: For certain exclusion of malignancy and because of displacement of other thoracic structures the patient was operated on this mediastinal mass by anterolateral thoracotomy.	0.9938447921304389
Histologically a dysontogenetic, benign cyst with an inner layer of mesothel and nerval as well as vascular structures in the capsule was diagnosed.	0.9357710203206138
Since the operation the patient has persistent sinus rhythm without symptoms of relevant rhythm disorders.	1.00450080919907
An overview of different kinds of intrathoracical cysts is given.	0.760221369517825
Longstanding and untreated scaphoid fractures and scapholunate dissociations lead to painful destruction of the wrist with carpal collapse.	0.9213709225425801
The severity of degenerative arthrosis is classified in three stages and can be treated adaequate operatively.	1.0099946539230367
SNAC wrist (scaphoid nonunion advanced collapse) after failed fusion of the scaphoid and SLAC wrist (scapholunate advanced collapse) after scapholunate dissociation should be differentiated.	0.9480890959531006
The reconstruction of the scaphoid or scapholunate ligament in stage II and III is no reasonable option.	0.8861886891856069
Motion preserving procedures such as proximal row carpectomy or midcarpal arthrodesis are preferable in this situation.	0.7559750536125941
Thirty-one male patients (average 41 years) were treated for SNAC or SLAC wrist with midcarpal arthrodesis.	1.2299039071075861
All patients were reexamined, the mean follow-up was 15 months.	1.3362746711170415
Grip strength was measured with the Dexter-System, pain was evaluated by a visual analogue scale (VAS 0-100).	1.0483450707264126
Patients' daily activities and general quality of life were estimated with the DASH-questionnaire.	0.9698251628722792
Pain was reduced to 50% compared to the preoperative situation.	1.0791816190948242
Grip strength improved to 60% of the opposite side.	1.1526801024442082
Active range of motion reached 50% of the contralateral wrist.	1.2310871536289412
Nonunion at the fusion site necessitated additional surgery in four patients resulting in total wrist arthrodesis.	0.9459560501817843
80% of the patients returned to their original occupation.	1.0271306797743283
Midcarpal fusion is a reliable procedure for treating the difficult condition of advanced carpal collapse is proper realignement of the carpus is performed.	0.9261493265553735
The DASH-score reflects the subjective impressions of the patients in daily life and justifies the choice of a salvage procedure preserving wrist mobility.	1.147039288677169
Total wrist fusion represents the last line of defense.	0.6662784928204604
Stress fractures are one of the most common overuse injuries seen in athletes, accounting for up to 20 % of all injuries presented to sports medicine clinics.	1.210252014230351
Runners are particularly prone to these injuries, however, it is difficult to predict injury as there is usually a critical interplay between the athlete's biomechanical predisposition, training methods, and other factors such as diet, and muscle strength and flexibility.	1.1401462448725286
This article will discuss the key clinical findings for the majority of stress fractures encountered in a sports medicine practice.	1.022294201699695
A classification scheme will also be described that will allow the clinician to make appropriate treatment decisions based on the degree of risk for each injury.	0.9960897750312534
Today, enzyme therapy with proteolytic enzymes still only plays a minor role in clinical practice, partially due to the belief that intestinal resorption of macromolecules is impossible.	0.9062998634720837
However, there is scientific evidence of intestinal resorption and a subsequent increase in proteolytic serum activity, and placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials have demonstrated positive effects of enzyme therapy.	1.2587342938408213
The documented effects include the reduction of oedema and resorption of haematoma, resulting in pain reduction and better mobility.	0.9444861842860451
There are indications to use such therapies in the areas of general surgery, traumatology, plastic surgery, and dental surgery.	1.06242756524274
A further effect is higher tissue concentration of antibiotics in combination with proteolytic enzymes.	0.8519755287827696
In gynaecological treatments, enzymes are administered in breast surgery and to reduce the side effects of obstetrical injuries.	0.9108807057692611
Breast engorgement is a further indication for enzyme therapy.	0.7953503034010881
Further studies concerning enzyme therapy are justified because of the interesting possibilities offered by these substances and a favourable relationship between costs and benefits.	0.9532369476762209
High-frequency ventilation and inhaled nitric oxide represent - among others - two treatment options in hypoxemic respiratory failure of neonates.	1.1222741658837851
We report the case of a term infant with meconium aspiration syndrome, who only responded favorably to inhaled nitric oxide following the initiation of high-frequency ventilation.	0.9681699508185663
At an oxygenation index of 17 we started treatment with nitric oxide in order to reverse right-to-left shunting and improve oxygenation.	0.9290458933997995
How- ever the respiratory situation did not improve, the oxygenation index increased to 25.	0.9316526506145806
After discontinuation of nitric oxide the mode of ventilation was switched to HFV with mean airway pressures of 15 mbar.	0.7647581498238746
Again oxyena-tion was unaffected with an oxygenation index of meanwhile 31.	0.7556869967763215
At that stage of a second trial of inhaled nitric oxide was started at a concentration of 10 ppm while continuing high-frequency ventilation.	0.974957236642232
Immediately oxygenation improved significantly, the oxygenation index decreased to 9 within several minutes after restarting nitric oxide.	0.9184363300471455
This effect on oxygenation was sustained for the duration of several days during high-frequency ventilation until gradual weaning from iNO could be performed.	1.0378470895615088
Learning microsurgery of the middle ear requires preparations of temporal bones.	0.7301349908978612
Ethical and moral restrictions in obtaining specimens make training and research with temporal bone preparations increasingly more difficult.	0.7970788565732189
Due to the complex structure of the temporal bone with its communicating cavities, the manufacture of facsimiles up to now has been impossible.	1.0803229338091418
Rapid prototyping techniques must be able to produce identical objects from an original one.	0.7774052707190701
By using CT scans of temporal bones from anatomic preparations and patients we have been able to reconstruct 3D pictures on a CAD workstation.	0.9463775013107327
We are now able to incorporate data in a stereolithographic system to create an anatomic facsimile of the temporal bone.	0.9459586454750839
It is possible to produce a considerable number of these facsimiles from the same real object.	1.1717011654693985
With this method we can produce models of human structure for medical teaching, training and research.	1.028798343695555
Our artificial preparations of temporal bones correspond to both the material characteristics and anatomic details of human structures, allowing various surgical exercises to be carried out.	0.9118249623440611
During the past few years the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, the most frequent of the rheumatic inflammatory systemic diseases has improved a great deal.	1.3281680420016289
The treatment strategy is based on the one hand on the so-called prognostic factors and on the other hand on the extent of the inflammatory activities, especially during the first phase.	1.281450579255683
Numerous controlled studies and meta-analyses have enabled optimal application of the basic disease-modifying drugs, with regard to efficacy and side effects.	1.039684290848103
During the first stage of these disease, the immunobiological substances against pro-inflammatory cells are employed.	1.057695418751801
Improved knowledge of physiotherapeutic treatment, correct diet and careful observation of the patient's progress with the aid of questionnaires enable optimal care with regard to life quality.	1.0840653266875853
Intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEPi) occurring during mechanical ventilation depends on expiratory time constants, expiratory volume and expiration time as well as on external flow resistance (tubes, valves, etc.).	0.859394315416282
It is not routinely determined in mechanically ventilated patients, but it is necessary to optimize respirator settings.	1.2212951023390857
The aim of the present study was the validation of an automated PEEPi determination method implemented in the respirator EVITA (Drägerwerke, Lübeck) in mechanically ventilated patients with acute lung failure.	1.0983641636354093
The method was validated in ten sedated, myorelaxed patients with respiratory insufficiency of different etiologies (five with restrictive, and five with obstructive pulmonary disease).	1.1335280283584388
PEEPi was determined using the volume constant ventilatory mode at ZEEP or at an external PEEP of 5 as well as 10 cm H2O.	0.9714436347074148
PEEPi was first determined with the automated method implemented in the EVITA (five measurements at each end-expiratory pressure level; PEEPEvita).	0.9656891477268889
Steady-state was attained between each measurement.	0.6093007790794464
These values were compared to the results obtained with end-expiratory occlusion (external, computer-controlled valve in the inspiratory limb of the circuit) at the respective pressure levels (PEEPEEO).	1.1865258659195927
The average of five measurements at each PEEP level with each method was defined as PEEPi for the particular ventilatory situation.	0.948960770608474
Gas flow was measured at the proximal end of the endotracheal tube with a heated pneumotachometer (Fleisch no.	0.8596999301641627
2, Fleisch, Lausanne, Switzerland) and a differential pressure transducer.	1.0911332897424855
Tracheal pressure was determined in the same position with a further differential pressure transducer (Dr. Fenyves & Gut, Basel, Switzerland).	0.9547758828257317
After A/D conversion, data were sampled with a frequency of 20 Hz and processed on an IBM compatible PC.	0.9480591382272737
Software for data collection and processing as well as for control of the occlusion valve was self-programmed.	1.027916579935285
For the statistical analysis we used the Mann-Whitney U-test or Wilcoxon signed-ranks test; a P value less than 0.05 was considered significant.	0.9480400368330073
At the given respiratory setting and without PEEP patients with obstructive lung disease had a higher PEEPi (median: 6.4 cm H2O; range: 5.0 - 9.6 cm H2O) than those with restrictive pulmonary disease (median: 2.3 cm H2O; range: 0.8 - 3.0 cm H2O) (P<0.05).	1.3266083773962776
Increasing external PEEP to 5 or 10 cm H2O significantly decreased the pressure difference between PEEPi and external PEEP (P<0.05), but was unable to eliminate it completely.	1.0546861285804774
There was no statistically significant difference between PEEPEEO and PEEPEvita (P=0.43; Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests).	1.0579143108033633
Regression analysis showed a highly significant correlation between PEEPEEO and PEEPEvita values (r=0.985, P<0.001; y=1.03x-0.18).	0.9176784243774192
PEEPi occurs during ventilation in patients with obstructive and restrictive lung disease.	0.8994342914849882
The difference between external end-expiratory pressure and PEEPi decreases with increasing external PEEP.	0.9532265327363607
However, PEEPi may increase with increasing external PEEP in some instances.	1.2984373278051717
The reason for this may be that the PEEPi determined at the proximal end of the endotracheal tube represents only a mean value of different PEEPi values of various lung regions.	1.0214335506076384
Increasing external PEEP only partially alters this mean value due to an effect on PEEPi values lower than external PEEP.	0.9291691661350986
The PEEPi values measured by the EVITA respirator compared with classical end-expiratory occlusion with an external valve were nearly identical.	1.0264547173137788
Unfortunately, PEEPi measurement of the EVITA can only	1.0193561547808652
We report on the case of a 70-year-old caucasian woman with a large linear sebaceous naevus with multifocal intralesional basaliomas and a lipodermoid of the left eye.	1.1710176438249063
This rare finding has been preserved because of the special history of the patient.	0.9858080052776155
The naevus spread on the left side from parietal to retroauricular, nuchal and sternal.	0.8573384589126279
Because of the patient's cardio-pulmonary insufficiency we excised the basaliomas under local anaesthesia.	0.9387551094710159
We also made a partial stripped excision of the left-sided parietal parts of the naevus.	1.0681743254898284
We describe an HLA-B27 positive patient in whom posttraumatic pyogenic sacroilitis led to complete unilateral sacroiliac joint ankylosis in the absence of any signs indicative of HLA-B27 associated spondyloarthropathy.	0.9040304642754743
Ondansetron, a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, has recently been shown, in a dose of 8 mg, to be superior to 1.25 mg droperidol in preventing postoperative vomiting.	1.2374212722064057
There are indications that a dose of 4 mg of ondansetron may be just as effective in reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting as a dose of 8 mg [16].	1.0613774883523615
The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and the adverse effects of 4 mg ondansetron in the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting compared to droperidol in patients undergoing surgery with inhalation anaesthesia supplemented with alfentanil.	1.0079290951933395
Following institutional approval, 40 ASA physical status I and II women scheduled for minor gynaecological surgery gave informed consent to participate in this randomized, double-blind comparative study.	0.8882043001346082
Five minutes before induction of general anaesthesia, 20 patients received a single intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg of ondansetron and the remaining 20 received 1.25 mg droperidol IV.	1.0031870550492632
Anaesthesia was induced with 2.1 - 4 mg/kg of thiopental and 0.1 mg of alfentanil IV and maintained with 65% nitrous oxide and 1.5% - 3% enflurane in oxygen.	1.3672879153477693
On pain stimuli another 0.2 - 0.4 mg of alfentanil was given.	1.463912753700501
Total effective antiemetic response was defined as the absence of nausea and vomiting for 24 h postoperatively.	0.9147961377239167
The incidence of nausea, vomiting and the number of patients showing total antiemetic response as well as the incidence of adverse effects were compared with the chi2 test and P<0.05 was considered significant.	1.0742044161122362
Patients were similar with respect to age, height, body weight and total anaesthetic agents received.	0.8062971768537863
Duration of anaesthesia and the time until awakening was not significantly different among groups.	1.2369483913931811
Postoperatively 7 out of 20 patients given 4 mg of ondansetron and 3 out of 20 patients with droperidol vomited (n.s.).	0.9963394230229639
The incidence of nausea was 11 out of 20 in the ondansetron group, and 4 out of 20 in the droperidol group (P<0.05).	0.9199161287285889
Sixteen patients in the droperidol group and 8 patients in the ondansetron group showed a total effective antiemetic response (P<0.05).	0.8695279447553852
Postoperative sedation and well-being scores did not differ significantly among groups.	1.0572165363274642
Our results show that for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting 4 mg of ondansetron was inferior to 1.25 mg of droperidol.	0.9137291154699411
The drugs were given intravenously prior to general anaesthesia for minor gynaecological surgery with nitrous oxide and enflurane in oxygen supplemented with small boluses of alfentanil.	0.8777634116588504

Since 1993, 30 patients with acute distal intraarticular radius fractures have been treated under arthroscopic assistance.	0.7623869412427795
According to the AO classification there were 3 B- and 27 C-fractures, most of them Frykman VIII fractures.	1.0856752658731679
Of 30 fractures 23 showed additional lesions which could only be diagnosed under arthroscopic view.	0.8287058852013041
In particular, 12 partial or complete tears of the intracarpal ligaments were found.	1.04666758449662
Of 25 fractures 23 which were treated at least 12 months previously could be followed up radiologically and clinically.	1.052647449082131
X-rays included postero anterior and lateral views to evaluate the radial angles and the radial length and stress tests to check for instability, especially of the scapholunate ligaments.	1.0536873691362456
Clinical examination included range of motion and objective grip strength measured with a Jamar (Cedaron) tester.	0.8763712620402864
Each test was performed on both wrists for comparison.	0.9296486269103058
Subjective data included pain and function for daily activities.	0.7573486944772044
Data were evaluated by the Jakim and the Cooney scoring system and the demerit point system by Gartland and Werley as modified by Sarmiento et al.	0.6026719796579222
About 70% of our patients showed an excellent or good result; about 15% had a poor result.	1.268570096438235
However, we must mention that we were not able to reduce one C3-fracture under arthroscopic view and had to switch to a semi-open procedure with additional external fixateurs.	1.109974630761019
Arthroscopically assisted treatment of distal intraarticular fractures is not only useful to detect and manage additional carpal lesions, but seems to give good midterm results as well.	1.0652189423774527
Antitachycardia pacing techniques (ATP) have proved useful for termination of ventricular tachycardia (VT).	0.8791940417594681
However, little is known about the efficacy and safety off ATP during long-term follow-up in a larger study population.	1.1831321214426092
We analyzed the data of 80 ICD patients (pts) with spontaneous monormorphic VT, mean age 59  +/-  12 years, the mean follow-up was 26  +/-  17 months.	1.264159597904852
50 pts (62.5%) had coronary artery disease, 18 (22.5%) dilative cardiomyopathy (DCM), the remaining 12 pts (15%) had no or other cardiac diseases.	1.2232614884832986
2926 episodes of ventricular tachycardia (cycle length 349  +/-  51 ms, 240-520 ms) occurred in 64/80 pts (80%), overall efficacy of ATP was 89.9%, acceleration occurred in 4.1% of VTs.	1.1268250910862252
Success of ATP did not correlate with positive ATP testing on induced arrhythmias, LVEF, NYHA class or aneurysm.	0.8273840672972606
Neither underlying heart disease nor antiarrhythmic medication had an impact on the ATP success rate.	0.7584613451840919
ATP efficacy was linked significantly to short VT cycle length (VTCL, 240-300 ms, p < 0.01) and long coupling intervals (91-97%), p < 0.01).	0.8759933731058991
Acceleration occurred in 32% of pts and in 4.1% of VT episodes; it was also dependent on short VT cycle length (< 300 ms vs > 300 ms, p < 0.04) and short coupling intervals (< 81% vs >= 81%, p <= 0.01).	1.321488458956469
Methodological work was performed in the field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) in order to develop suitable tools for non-invasive characterization of hematopoetic bone marrow.	1.0236111324333017

Hydromorphone is a µ receptor agonist opioid.	0.632473834679711
According to WHO recommendations, hydromorphone is to be classified in step III of pain therapy.	0.9306542516419368
An oral formulation with a prolonged duration of action of 12 hours has been evaluated only recently.	0.976036417415967
The controlled release capsule is especially suited for the regular twice a day administration in cases of severe and persistent pain.	1.0405822114917873
The oral formulation of hydromorphone increases the number of opioid analgesics available for pain therapy in step III.	0.9385995038592148
Hydromorphone is recommended when morphine fails to produce sufficient pain relief (despite increase of doses) or causes intolerable side effects (despite treatment of symptoms).	0.9812768692528272
In principle, no differences in efficacy of morphine and hydromorphone are to be expected.	1.0216156509431251
However, clinical experience shows that changing one opioid analgesic to another one can improve the treatment of patients so that hydromorphone may replace another opioid analgesic to which a patient fails to respond well or develops side effects.	1.17956958691159
The dose of hydromorphone equivalent to 2 times 30 mg controlled release morphine is about 2 times 4 mg.	0.9563612192199511
The values for the absorption, bioavailability and maximum plasma concentration after the administration of controlled release hydromorphone every 12 hours -of three times the dose- are equivalent to those of an immediate release tablet given every 4 hours.	1.1015313745238493
In several open label and controlled studies, hydromorphone proved to be of good efficacy in the treatment of acute and persistent pain, especially in patients with severe cancer pain.	1.1804824066030744
With regard to the incidence of side effects, no significant differences between morphine and hydromorphone could be established.	1.077971418251055
In general, the side effects of hydromorphone are typical for opioid analgesics.	0.9823566568590949

As augmentation, materials autografts from the iliac crest (combined with alveolar ridge augmentations in 16 sinus lifts) were transplanted in 39 cases and osteoinductive, allogeneic bone powder (AAA bone (autolyzed, antigen-extracted, allogeneic bone): n = 8, DFDBA (demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft) and/or GraftonTM (demineralized bone matrix gel): n = 35) were used in 43 cases.	1.0162983176238984
Some 4-6 months after implantation, osteoinductive, allogeneic (demineralized) bone implants showed radio-opaque areas as an equivalent of bone formation.	1.1175757171376812
Histological examinations revealed that osteoinductive implants were completely transformed into patients' own bone tissue.	0.8610945841103049
The average augmentation height after autograft transplantations was 14 ( +/-  3) mm in comparison with 9 ( +/-  3) mm after allograft implantations.	1.0630080835799942
Histologically as well as radiologically no differences of the bone quality could be determined between the two augmentation materials.	1.1576476084466718
Endoscopic controls showed, in both groups, nonirritated mucous membranes.	0.8986251695671016
On an average 2 endosseous implants (Bone LockR or ITIR-screw implants) were inserted into the augmentated maxillary sinus floors in both groups.	0.9262836002590166
No osseointegration was achieved in 4 out of 67 dental implants when bone autografts were used and in 2 out of 74 dental implants of the allogeneic bone group.	1.026514904471621
Patients with bone autografts suffered from postoperative complaints on an average of 19 ( +/-  9) days (without consideration of 2 patients with postoperative complaints persisting for more than 90 days).	1.166899674283485
The average postoperative complaints of recipients of allogeneic bone implants continued for 3 ( +/-  5) days.	1.1158619353765165
The 13 patients who underwent an ambulant sinus lift procedure with allogeneic bone powder were already symptom-free several hours after the operation.	1.0352465883504682
Under critical consideration of all investigated parameters, osteoinductive bone implants are preferable to iliac bone autografts for maxillary sinus augmentations in those cases in which no additional alveolar ridge augmentation is required.	0.9083732769671573
We describe a patient with a primary renal plasmacytoma.	1.2137248038351145
In the literature available, only six clinical cases have been reported.	1.1807856280201376
A 64-year-old patient is presented who had the clinical signs of a renal cell carcinoma.	1.2537805949272525
Histological examination after nephrectomy, however, revealed a plasmacytoma.	1.1621844059829953
Based on this case, we discuss how one should proceed in this disease.	1.0845614395025187
Primary renal plasmacytoma can be tentatively diagnosed preoperatively only in the presence of paraproteinemia or Bence-Jones proteinuria, as it cannot be distinguished from other renal tumors by imaging procedures.	0.9909756586764534
Postoperatively, further staging procedures must rule out bone involvement (solitary myeloma or multiple myeloma).	0.8937703282723849
Nephrectomy is required in patients with plasmacytoma only if renal complications occur.	0.7427400700268619
Dissection of the ascending aorta (type A) following later after aortic valve replacement has been described with increasing frequency.	1.0926529426399052
This study analyzes the role of aortic valve replacement for the evolution of late dissection.	0.9478418826044431
Between December 1986 and November 1995, 222 patients with 225 acetabular fractures were treated operatively by three surgeons in the Department of Traumatology and Emergency Surgery of the University Hospitals of the Catholic University of Leuven.	1.0651238977824444
Indications for surgery were unstable fracture, displaced fracture through the acetabular dome and fracture with intra-acetabular fracture fragments.	0.8982359322121575
There were 37.3% A-fractures, 49.7% B-fractures, and 13% C fractures according to the AO Classification.	1.169151291902406
In 16.4% of fractures there were primary neurological deficits.	1.112986698991938
Patients were treated operatively after an average of 5.0 days.	1.4460701288123823
The Kocher-Langenbeck approach was used in 56.9% of cases, the ilio-inguinal approach in 27.1% and the extended iliofemoral approach in 4%.	1.1730726217013503
In 7.1% of patients, a primary total hip endoprosthesis was implanted.	1.1358230207192435
There was no intra- oder perioperative mortality.	0.9108214542154374
The average hospital stay was 26.1 days.	0.9593986966550221
In 7.1% of patients, we noted secondary neurological problems.	1.1079442531446884
Deep infections were present in 1.3%.	0.8867641844880328
In 11.1% of patients a second operative procedure was necessary.	1.3316506387029001
We were able to review 175 patients after an average of 2 years.	0.8670359214224862
Signs of arthrosis and periarticular ossification were noted on the x-rays: walking distance, hip mobility and pain intensity were asked about and recorded after the clinical examination.	1.0774584927839304
In 76% of patients an excellent or good result on the Merle-d'Aubigne scale was obtained.	1.1109240425111757
T-fractures and posterior wall fractures were followed by the worst results.	1.0227029585256773
During this 9-year period, changes have been made to the preoperative radiological examination carried out, the choice of operative approach and our policy on prevention of thrombosis prophylaxis and postoperative ossification.	1.2144417203749212
After thorough preoperative diagnosis and with a meticulous operative technique, it is possible to stabilise the vast majority of acetabular fractures through the three classical approaches.	1.1371725916768898
Because the fractures are relatively rare, their diagnosis complex and their surgical treatment difficult, specific training is essential for every acetabular surgeon.	1.1470129076841058
Diagnostic pitfalls exist when benign salivary gland diseases are mistakenly classified as malignant, with consequences for treatment and prognosis.	0.9925452824347178
Examples are necrotizing sialometaplasia, metaplastic Warthin tumour and sclerosing polycystic sialadenopathy.	0.7043189736615129
The proper diagnosis is of eminent importance to distinguish cases of primary tumours that have developed in salivary glands or their lymph nodes from cases of extraglandular tumours with metastases in these glands or their nodes.	1.011959863847252
In these cases clinical data and additional immunocytochemical methods are necessary to clarify the exact diagnosis, especially when the primary salivary gland tumours have a structure largely identical to the metastases (e.g.	1.0316960592322362
Nasopharyngeal or cervical chordomas can be mistaken for pleomorphic adenoma or mucinous adenocarcinoma.	0.7186424027827825
The initial stage of malignant MALT lymphomas in association with Sjögren's syndrome demands identification of clonal rearrangement for therapeutic implication.	0.7983718426338455
The diagnostic criteria for proper classification are analysed in detail.	0.8149163212735729
A 59-year-old male patient was transnasally operated on because of a pituitary adenoma with hypopituitarism.	0.923649571176216
A second operation and X-ray therapy followed a half year later due to recurrent tumor.	0.9894240962074369
Both neoplasmas were classified as sparsely granulated prolactin cell adenomas.	0.6000507336620226
Immunohistochemical studies revealed strong immunoreactivity for prolactin and FSH in the tumor cells of both the pituitary adenoma and the recurrent tumor.	1.1063113421271689
Two years later the prolactin plasma levels were extremely elevated.	0.8265633514564086
A tumor in the liver was identified.	0.844433361223945
Biopsy revealed a solid endocrine tumor containing prolactin by immunohistology.	0.6968159415244561
Due to structural and immunohistological similarities this tumor could be identified as a metastasis of the pituitary tumor.	0.9547219845402457
After 5 months of therapy the patient died from thrombembolism.	1.2394226816315
Post-mortem studies confirmed the diagnosis of a metastasizing prolactin-secreting pituitary carcinoma.	0.9331409143943541
Only six similar cases have been reported in the literature.	0.6474351857576008
Our case report confirms the experience with 35 definite pituitary carcinomas reparted in the current literature: malignant pituitary tumors develop after pituitary surgery and can be identified not from the pituitary tumor, but only from its metastases.	1.1461449648655333
Paraneoplastic markers in tumor patients may occur at various stages of the disease.	0.8939235862990277
While some disorders almost invariably herald an underlying malignancy (obligative marker), most only occasionally do so (facultative marker).	1.0236575929818648
The association of bullous pemphigoid with malignancy is controversial.	0.6997897964951156
There are only a few reports of bullous pemphigoid associated with a renal cell carcinoma.	0.857891722318453
We diagnosed a renal cell carcinoma in a 74 year old female patient, admitted to the hospital because of bullous pemphigoid.	0.889516502257092
Multiple metastases were found in her lymph nodes, liver, lung and skeleton.	1.1150740392832195
The patient died eleven weeks after the first symptoms of bullous pemphigoid appeared.	1.1810268475868178
Acute compartment syndrome of the thigh has been infrequently reported in the literature.	0.763350608236581
Closed femoral fractures and blunt soft tissue trauma are the main causes of this injury.	1.0860061424392675
The multiple injured patient in this case report developed a compartment syndrome of the thigh after intramedullary nailing of a comminuted fracture of the femur.	1.0552071871884396
Fasciotomy was performed two days after surgery because of extense swelling of the thigh in the ventilated and sedated patient.	0.8780585390519655
Sciatic and femoral nerve palsy was recognized after extubation of the patient nine days after the injury.	1.0568268810781598
During the following weeks the paresis of the femoral nerve recovered but neither motor nor sensory function of the sciatic nerve could be demonstrated.	1.0433477614805
Therefore an operative revision of the sciatic nerve was performed eighteen weeks after trauma.	0.7702003033316603
No direct nerve injury could be detected but there were adhesions around the nerve as a sign of compression neuropathy caused by the compartment syndrome.	0.9795973444566287
The tibial component of the sciatic nerve showed a complete recovery within the next months but there was a persisting peroneal nerve palsy.	1.0699905404055856
Conclusion: Early clinical symptoms of a compartment syndrome like pain, paresthesia and paresis can not be ascertained in a ventilated and sedated patient.	0.984167289298303
Tense swelling of the muscles is often the only detectable sign.	0.8871155524936465
Frequent measurements of compartment pressure should be done in these patients.	0.8672958114669197
We suggest early decompressive fasciotomy because the morbidity caused by fasciotomy in a borderline compartment syndrome is far outweighed by the morbidity that accompanies an undiagnosed untreated compartment syndrome with possible nerve palsy.	0.900798626372757
Aim: The long-term effect of DNase with cystic fibrosis was examined.	0.8580394195005858
Teeth are most important for the identification of unknown cadavers.	0.7332566738557372
The police publish difficult cases of unidentified bodies in dental print media.	0.6961581361078415
Using their records such as x-rays or documented dental work dentists can often recognize an unknown person and thus contribute to the identification.	0.9523762904095842
To evaluate the efficency of this procedure 177 cases published between 1975 and 1995 were examined.	0.9835214529527159
Only 3% of the examined cases could be identified due to a reaction to publishing in the dental print media.	1.0995451346244567
To improve the presentation of identification cases in the dental print media 500 dentists were asked to take part in a survey.	0.9127146055066759
According to these results a new concept of presentation sould be developed to improve the efficency of this odontoforensic method.	0.9813759279637753
New technological possibilities such as digital x-raying or online data transfer could open new ways for forensic identification.	0.7584743675102801
In a fatality after oral intake of a large amount of an insecticide spray consisting of propoxur, tetramethrine and the solvents isopropanol and benzyl alcohol, a coagulation nectrotic fixation of the oesophagus and stomach were the main morphological findings.	0.9507532608979268
The concentrations determined by HPLC and GC/MS in femoral blood, liver, kidney, vitreous humor and liquor were in the comatose lethal range for propoxur (< 0.3-18 µg/g), whereas tetrametrin (up to 0.1 µg/g) was almost completely decomposed.	1.121840601570404
The propoxur decomposition product o-isopropoxyphenol (2.8-56 µg/g), benzyl alcohol (18-58 µg/g) and its oxydation product benzoic acid (85-140 µg/g), isopropanol (0.45-1.1 mg/g) and acetone (0.01-0.03 mg/g) were also found.	1.2983745477814255
On the other hand, the concentrations in heart blood and lung tissue were up to 30 times higher.	0.992185589149298
As a reason for these immense concentration differences an agonale aspiration of the highly concentrated liquid stomach content after vomiting immediately before death is discussed.	0.8587422648346654
The extent of the metabolization of propoxur to o-isopropoxyphenol and of benzyl alcohol to benzoic acid, which is assumed to proceed mainly postmortem, was quite different in the materials investigated and was almost complete in the liver.	1.0882365963339973
The intoxication by the acetylcholine esterase inhibitor propoxur in combination with the neurotoxic effect of tetramethrine was determined as the cause of death.	0.8848478697740975
Background: Despite the fact that deep lamellar keratoplasty (DLKP) is less invasive than to penetrating keratoplasty (PKP), this procedure is rarely performed.	1.3212337574002033
We therefore investigated whether or not the DLKP technique we employed can achieve stable improvement of visual acuity.	0.8339414453027428
Palmoplantar keratodermia (PPK) varians and PPK punctata are considered different entities within the group of hereditary palmoplantar keratodermas.	0.8235026256894501
Keratosis punctata of the palmar creases constitutes a localized form of keratodermia palmoplantaris punctata.	0.7740880853799994
We describe a 31-year-old man exhibiting both nummular and papular keratoses on the soles, as well as small punctate keratoses confined to the palmar creases.	0.9841769151403794
In view of the co-occurrence of these two types of PPK, the question arises whether keratosis palmoplantaris of the varians and the punctate type represent distinct entities or represent variable manifestations of the same gene defect.	1.0643925203844986
The author gives a synoptic view on the paths and routes of emigration the jewish and/or political reasons persecuted psychoanalysts had to take in order to escape national socialist Germany.	0.8499311967662339
With reference to current studies on emigration, which for Germany differentiates three distinctive phases of emigration between 1933 and 1938, the immigration policy especially of the United States and Great Britain and its impact on the concrete circumstances and modalities for the emigration of the particular professional group of psychoanalysts is described and discussed.	1.0287939431970676
In this context, the major importance of the solidarity and help the refugees were granted by the international psychoanalytic community and performed in spite of partially major theoretical differences and institutional rivalries is emphasized.	1.0436185592736213
Acute suppurative thyroiditis is very rare in childhood.	0.7905048849309402
We describe the clinical signs and the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures of thyroid abscesses in children, and add 2 own cases of this rare disease.	1.2518035849869502
In the first case, diagnosis of piriform sinus fistula was made finally after repeated drainage for recurrent abscesses of the left thyroid.	1.239762643287521
Operative excision of the fistula was performed and the child is doing well since then.	1.0195173479542359
In the second case, a left sided thyroid abscess was treated by incision and drainage only.	1.1385691287197213
Seven years later, no recurrent abscess occurred in this child.	0.9738050520234528
In conclusion, especially in left sided and recurrent thyroid abscesses the patients should be examined for a piriform sinus fistula as a route of infection.	1.1405978696629455
If present, complete removal of the fistula is essential for permanent cure.	1.1245062713868903
The importance of spiral-CT is clinically accepted for diagnosing spreading disease and for making a decision about the therapy strategy for head and neck tumors.	0.4911276634169387
Its importance for follow-up after radiotherapy was examined in 26 patients with irradiated laryngeal tumors.	0.5413971412368318
Using spiral-CT multiple signs of alterations (n=98) can be diagnosed, which are not only important for tumour relapse, but also for assessment.	0.8593329620925828
Spiral-CT offers the possibility of achieviny various additional information about the larynx that cannot be obtained with laryngoscopy.	0.4802409930616585
In follow-up examinations after radiation, laryngoscopy and spiral-CT are recommended as an integrated neck examination using the breath-holding technique (separately reconstructed) and also as functional spiral-CT of the vocal cords in "I"-phonation.	0.6227970554241586
Simpson in Scotland was the first to describe the administration of ether for analgesia in painful deliveries.	0.9658723716927692
Only a few days later E.C.J.	1.0759044540197857
von Siebold (*1801 in Würzburg - \dagger1861 in Göttingen) performed the first systematic study on ether in obstetrics.	1.1824047205557975
Following a preceding evaluation of the action of ether on non-pregnant woman and on pregnant women not in active labour, he administered ether for analgesia during the second stage of labour in eight parturients.	0.9992402808030505
The first administration was on February 25th 1847.	0.6368956035008848
While he was satisfied with the good analgesia without sequelae of the new-born, he was discouraged by the termination of uterine contractions observed in all his patients.	1.0993239182736882
He concluded that ether was not a useful substance for analgesia during vaginal delivery, since it disturbed the natural course of labour.	1.0264165376275718
On the other hand, von Siebold was very pleased with the administration of ether for operative obstetric procedures such as forceps deliveries or placental retention.	0.8181127911219973
Background: Mode switching aims to maintain a ventricular rhythm that matches metabolic needs during both sinus rhythm and atrial tachyarrhythmias.	1.1047112979006999
This allows patients with atrial arrhythmias to benefit from AV synchronous pacing modes.Aim and method: Beat-to-beat mode switching in Diamond and Clarity pacemakers is designed to maintain a relatively stable ventricular rhythm, ensuring consistent ventricular filling patterns.	0.9925011566946624
Atrial tachyarrhythmia detection is based on a continuous analysis of the atrial rhythm.	1.1433449240135363
A too rapid increase of the atrial rate with a beat-to-beat acceleration > 15 bpm is considered to be an atrial tachyarrhythmia.	1.1719619656764864
Mode switching occurs on detection of the first premature atrial event: atrial tracking is stopped and the ventricular rate is determined by the rate indicated by the dual sensor (QT interval and activity).	0.9922882006721385
Atrial pacing restores AV synchrony immediately after cessation of the atrial tachyarrhythmia, effectively avoiding retrograde conduction.	0.9037656397641505
Dedicated diagnostic functions allow one to monitor the incidence of atrial tachyarrhythmias and to study atrial and ventricular events just prior to its onset.	1.0176052035438716
Both the mode switching and rate responsive function are fully automatic, rendering follow-up procedures easy and less time-consuming.	1.0516152223374902
Conclusion: Reliable detection of all atrial events is essential to guarantee appropriate mode switching.	1.1417431368472248
Therefore, the pacemaker stores the distribution of the amplitude of all atrial events, both during sinus rhythm and atrial tachyarrhythmias, which facilitates the appropriate programming of the atrial sensitivity.	1.2355288300453784
Introduction: Mediastinal diseases are mostly diagnosed by CT and MRI.	1.185391332305057
The applicability of ultrasound is limited by the surrounding air- and bone-containing thorax, which permits only restricted echo windows.	1.1700724074147142
Transesophageal endoscopic ultrasonography circumvents this problem and ensures visualization of parts of the mediastinum.	0.728598476730115
Blood glucose alterations prior to cerebral ischaemia are associated with poor neurologic outcome, possibly due to extensive lactic acidosis or energy failure.	0.9459023532790758
Cerebral effects of hyper- or hypoglycaemia during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are less well known.	0.9557999079914262
In addition, little information is available concerning cardiac effects of blood glucose alterations.	1.2071486229491903
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of pre-cardiac-arrest hypo- or hyperglycaemia compared to normoglycaemia upon haemodynamics, cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolism (CMRO2), and regional cardiac blood flow during CPR subsequent to 3 min of cardiac and respiratory arrest and after restoration of spontaneous circulation.	0.9931267447602599
After approval by the State Animal Investigation Committee, 29 mechanically ventilated, anaesthetised pigs were instrumented for haemodynamic monitoring and blood flow determination by the radiolabeled microsphere technique.	0.9485814337772326
The animals were randomly assigned to one of three groups: in group I (n=9) blood glucose was not manipulated; in group II (n=10) blood glucose was increased by slow infusion of 40% glucose to 319 +/- 13 mg/dl; in group III (n=10) blood glucose was lowered by careful titration with insulin to 34 +/- 2 mg/dl.	1.1447966045837572
After 3 min of untreated ventricular fibrillation and respiratory arrest, CPR (chest compressor/ventilator (Thumper) and epinephrine infusion) was commenced and continued for 8 min.	1.0183577773302281
Thereafter, defibrillation was attempted, and if successful, the animals were observed for another 240 min.	1.2594677245560726
Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), CBF, CMRO2, coronary perfusion pressure (CorPP), and regional cardiac blood flow were determined at control, after 3 min of CPR, and at 10, 30, and 240 min post-CPR.	1.1830280893834908
In group I, 4/9 animals (44%) could be successfully resuscitated; in group II 4/10 (40%); and in group III 0/10 (0%).	1.2896991449267727
Prior to cardiac arrest, mean arterial pressure, CPP, and CorPP in group III were significantly lower compared to groups I and II.	1.0996458345626552
In group I, CPP during CPR was 26 +/- 6 mmHg; CBF 31 +/- 9 ml/min/100 g CMRO2 3.8 +/- 1.2 ml/min/100 g; CorPP 18 +/- 5 mmHg; and left ventricular (LV) flow 35 +/- 15 ml/min/100 g. In group II: CPP=21 +/- 5; CBF 21 +/- 7; CMRO2 1.8 +/- 0.8; CorPP 16 +/- 6; and LV flow 22 +/- 9; and in group III: CPP 15 +/- 3; CBF 11 +/- 8; CMRO2 1.5 +/- 1.1; CorPP 4 +/- 2; and LV flow 19 +/- 10.	1.1199969940798165
During the 240-min post-resuscitation period, there were no differences in CBF, CMRO2, or LV flow between groups I and II.	1.0142829455175144
Hypoglycaemia prior to cardiac arrest appears to be predictive for a poor cardiac outcome, whereas hyperglycaemia does not impair resuscitability compared to normoglycaemia.	1.0008274549934897
In addition, hyperglycaemia did not affect LV flow, CBF, or CMRO2.	1.0667158121874685
However, it has to be kept in mind that haemodynamics and organ blood flow do not permit conclusions with respect to functional neurologic recovery or histopathologic damage to the brain, which is very likely to be associated with hyperglycaemia.	1.2122946083464716
Abstract  We present an algorithm for the rational diagnosis of glutaric aciduria type I (GA1).	0.9506975640737985
Normal urinary organic acids in patients with non-specific clinical features and normal results of brain imaging render the diagnosis highly unlikely, and no further investigations are required.	1.1014321661192243
In other patients, the diagnostic strategy depends on the individual clinical, neuroradiological and biochemical findings.	1.1778297479099833
GCDH enzyme analysis should be reserved for patients in whom GA1 is very likely.	0.8498650940304906

Nasal NK/T cell lymphoma is mainly found in the nose and paranasal sinuses and often, but not always, display an angiocentric growth pattern leading to coagulation necrosis.	1.092988021994928
The tumor cells consistently express CD56, CD2 and the EBER molecules encoded by the Epstein-Barr virus.	0.8324427496238143
Clonal T cell receptor gene rearrangements are often absent indicating, in the majority of cases, a derivation of these tumors from NK cells.	1.1081905571330128
Enteropathy-type intestinal T-cell lymphomas often arise in patients with celiac disease and have a dismal prognosis.	1.0527738923689334
The tumour cells express T cell antigens, CD103 and cytotoxic molecules, but are negative for CD4.	1.0520278416506164
Approximately 20% of the cases display CD56 mostly in combination with CD8.	1.0066762827384064
Recently, an early purely intraepithelial form of this tumour was identified.	1.281853569870055
Histologically these cases resemble celiac disease, however the intraepithelial lymphocytes often exhibit an abnormal immunophenotype with absent CD8 and T-cell-receptor protein expression, and, they are clonal by molecular analysis.	1.1125433775829099
Clinically, the patients suffer from refractory sprue or ulcerative jejunitis.	0.9770697127276665
The prognosis is bad with the patients often dying from malnutrition or an invasive tumour-forming T-cell lymphoma.	1.0501387619330582
Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma is defined by characteristic morphological findings (atypical lymphoid cells in part with pale cytoplasm, arborizing high endothelial venules and large FDC-meshworks) as well as clinical features (systemic symptoms, signs of a dysregulated immune response).	0.9776091098624321
Peripheral T-cell lymphomas, that do not fit into a distinct entity, are classified in the REAL and the new WHO classifications as peripheral T-cell lymphomas unspecified.	1.143340531826043
These display a broad morphological spectrum (including the T-cell lymphomas of different cell sizes, Lennert's lymphoma and T-zone lymphoma of the Kiel-classification) and in general are clinically aggressive.	1.2015414842925816
Causes and courses of the diseases are subjected to a change of an increasing life expectancy on the one hand and technically highly developed medicine on the other hand.	1.060320637966316
Since a growing number of elderly people is denying intensive medical interventions which serve the purpose of keeping them alive despite severe diseases, the problem of euthanasia imposes direct questions.	1.0501112603127607
A central role is played by the active-passive difference and its moralistic legitimacy.	0.9240851592031515
The difficulties of this difference are discussed below on the applicable level of ethical discussions.	0.8944596021604673
At the same time, knowledge of the danger is being made aware that in a maximal therapeutical orientated medical care system the desire for euthanasia may become identical with the reverse side of this care system.	0.9401682434838806
Isolated severe head trauma (SHT) or SHT in combination with multiple injuries are important factors for the prognosis of morbidity and mortality in patients suffering from the consequences of accidents.	1.1239868811789395
The prognosis mainly depends on the presence of primary mechanic brain injury and the development of secondary brain damage.	0.8350968725968343
Causes for the development of secondary brain damage are the intracranial space demand after traumatic injury and edema formation which may result in iscemia, as well as inflammatory processes.	0.8299570095559778
Both isolated SHT and polytrauma with or without brain damage may result in a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) due to the synthesis of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators which may cause a single or multiple organ failure (MOF).	0.996670418582395
Often the organism is able to survive isolated traumatic injuries and functional disturbances, but in combination or cumulation they may be lethal.	1.0954339674120128
The hypermetabolism after SHT is often regarded as an interaction between the central nervous system and the whole organism by the activation of the neuroendocrine axis.	1.005790162886345
In contrast to the consequences of SHT for the whole organism, multiple injuries after polytrauma may affect brain functions, such as the shock dependent disturbance of the brain perfusion accompanied by brain hypoxia which may lead to an aggravated prognosis.	1.128979339337684
Moreover, coagulation, metabolism and fracture healing are influenced by the onset of SIRS as well.	1.0343093706399253
Our knowledge about the bidirectional inflammatory interaction between brain and whole organism is still limited.	0.9345497207095074
In this context, the effects of secondary surgical interventions which may additionally stress a traumatized body have to be considered and are the subject for actual clinical discussions and experimental studies.	1.0865088382066934
This article tries to summarize some important aspects on this topic.	0.6491535157214735
Background: Chronic cough and thoracic pain, commonly caused by upper airway infections, are frequently seen symptoms in pediatrics.	1.218402396049736
These "benign" symptoms are very seldom caused by malignant disorders.	0.8553638385641325
Methods: In two patients (male, age 41/12 and 43/12 years) chronic cough and thoracic pain were due to a malignant pulmonary neoplasm (Pleuropulmonary blastoma).	1.0778799431686912
Results: Pleuropulmonary blastoma is a rare malignant primary pulmonary neoplasm in childhood with a poor prognosis.	1.1221950104284317
An incomplete resection was performed in both cases.	1.0696692054578654
Both patients received postoperative radiotherapy and combination chemotherapy.	0.7514026934118071
One boy died, the other one is alive and well more than 6 years after diagnosis without evidence of disease.	1.2196278307736126
Conclusion: Our findings indicate that even after incomplete resection subsequent multimodal therapy (adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy) can provide a long term remission.	1.1599313148880246
In 12 patients with systemic sclerosis the influence of hypnosis and autogenic training on the acral blood circulation and the coping with the disease was investigated in a pilot study.	1.1069820114874949
In the first step significant increases in the skin temperature of the fingers (mean +/- SD: 3.9 +/- 1.2  °C) could be found after relaxation hypnosis.	1.2380277213765913
In the second step six patients (study group) gained experience with autogenic training.	0.9704202238405298
The other six patients served as control group.	0.5510590477022933
In the study group, the skin temperature of the fingers (short-term effect) was significantly higher than in the control group (1.9 +/- 1.0  °C).	1.2386244017123784
Long-term effects of the autogenic training (mean acral rewarning time, duration and course of the Raynaud attacks, acral lesions of the hands, psychosomatic status of complaints, type of relation to the disease as precondition for coping with the disease) were not found within the relatively short follow-up period of 4 months.	1.2838510049117544
Two patients, however, reported that they could shorten the duration of Raynaud attacks by autogenic training.	0.9929527028704724
In our patients heterogenicity and an increased score of multiple psychosomatic complaints were registered at the outset.	1.0315235862982837
As far as the type of relation to the disease is concerned, the patients could be assessed as almost adapted.	1.261622973711389
Hypnosis and autogenic training can be recommended as complementary therapy in systemic sclerosis.	0.9194136647574825
Abstract The term acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) reflects an acute worsening of the stable state with an increase in dyspnea, cough, and count or purulence of sputum.	0.952747823785875
The management of an acute exacerbation is guided mainly clinical severity which has implications on the decision of outpatient management, hospital management or intensive care treatment.	1.0930389209883662
Cardiopulmonary comorbidity and the number of previous exacerbations are prognostic factors.	0.6901094048404178
The first-line therapy of each exacerbation is the intensification of drug-treatment with 2-agonists and anticholinergics.	1.057703309793695
Systemic steroids as a short-term course are advocated if hospital-treatment is necessary.	1.0707419498011341
Infections of the respiratory tract are a frequent cause of acute exacerbations.	1.1279995677854233
However, a colonization with potential pathogenic microorganisms is found in many patients in the stable state.	1.1960950820882557
Antibiotic treatment is justified if cardiopulmonary comorbidity and frequent previous exacerbations are present.	0.9297242493497843
The severity of airflow obstruction and the frequency of previous exacerbations are linked to the spectrum of the underlying microorganisms.	0.9952917287474617
This should be borne in mind for the choice of the antimicrobiotic treatment.	1.0295497872835064
Noninvasive ventilation in severe exacerbation is able to improve gas-exchange and to reduce the work of breathing.	0.8715528044457883
As a consequence the number of intubations and the attributable morbidity and mortality are reduced.	1.1112020076121945
If invasive mechanical ventilation is necessary, the potential of dynamic hyperinflation in acute exacerbation has to be considered.	1.0568165022337235
Background: In 1986 Prof. H. Olbing (University of Essen Pediatrics Department), supported by Prof. G. Stickler (Mayo Medical School, Minnesota), introduced a 4-weeks clinical skills lab for all students (annual class 250), based on self-instruction by means of computer-assisted, interactive, audiovisual learning materials, models, bedside teaching and seminars on special topics (partially peer-guided).	1.0630849833720306
Each year 14 chosen senior medical students get a two weeks intensive training in order to function as peer tutors for the bedside teaching.	0.8793936583667967
The peer tutors train the junior students in basic behaviour and clinical examination skills.	0.7781478821117117
Each tutor is active during 4-5 skills lab periods, and in each period he/she coaches two groups of two students each.	1.0919169827046544
During the bedside teaching phase each group examines and presents four patients.	0.6611151667883253
Spinal injuries referring to banal falls are common injuries in elderly persons.	0.7801299043908482
Up to 55 years of age spinal fractures are more frequent in men while its opposite in older persons.	0.9567545790812815
There are two typical lesions: odontoid fracture in the upper cervical spine and compression fracture in thoracolumbar spine.	1.0463632670647367
Odontoid fracture is the most frequent lesion in cervical spine in the elderly.	1.097719635969839
This is caused by trabecular structure of dens axis and spine's stiffness in old age.	0.6886848475766201
Instable fractures in extension type II are most common.	0.8778305599613236
In many cases the instability of the lesion is hidden and can be first seen in functional examination controlled by x-ray.	0.9894073658659522
Conservative treatment is efficient in stable lesions type III while there is a high risk for pseudarthrosis in treatment of instable lesions in elderly with Halo Fixateur e. g. We think that the best operation for these fractures is the anterior screw fixation.	1.10776434067226
If this is not sufficient because of low bone mass or early dislocation of the screws a dorsal fusion C1/C2 with transarticular screwing e. g. should be done.	1.064427084427888
Because of rare symptoms thoracolumbar fractures in osteoporosis are hidden frequently.	0.7490178246292234
In many cases it's not easy to distinguish acute lesions from healed fractures or tumor lesions.	0.9144106594119056
Therefore there are just few compression fractures (A type) that have to be treated operatively.	1.2291492736884588
Instable lesions type B and C must be operated as well in the elderly as in the young.	1.1646343940335195
Because of low bone mass in elderly the dorsal instrumentation should include more than just the two injured segments.	0.8586911343190039
An even more adequate stabilisation is done with an additional vertebral replacement.	0.9045212554555531
Following curative minimal-invasive laser resection of T1-T3 laryngeal carcinomas, patients were subjected to an intensive voice rehabilitation.	1.0003452018525498
Therapy was effected twice a day for approximately 2 months, utilizing the concept of functional voice therapy.	0.8753294910241817
Before and after rehabilitation, acoustic analyses were made by using two different computer-supported measuring systems: (1) the "multidimensional voice program" (Kay Elementrics Corp.) and (2) a novel software program developed in Göttingen that includes a new voice quality parameter based on correlations between frequency bands.	1.098690397673753
Acoustic analyses showed superiority of the glottal versus supraglottal compensatory phonation.	0.7143979840132152
Findings showed that not all acoustic parameters equally documented voice improvement after rehabilitation.	0.8117261626940163
The standard deviation of fundamental frequency was the only parameter showing a significant post-therapeutic improvement.	0.8587800384793673
A further suitable acoustic method proved to be the voice quality parameter that has been newly introduced by us.	0.9593717095169803
In contrast to analogous parameters of other methods, this approach is independent of the exact periodicity of the glottal excitation function, thus permitting reliable results to be obtained even with aphonic or heavily dysphonic voices.	1.08004408404878
Aseptic pseudarthrosis may occur after all kinds of traumatology treatment.	0.7777877079220752
Following conservative treatment, incomplete immobilisation or an unattached bone fragment can be causal.	0.7341766967034625
After plate osteosynthesis the biomechanical principles are not efficient or the circulatory damage delays healing.	0.8670584213946778
There are two broad types of pseudarthrosis: vascular and nonvascular.	0.9700023927644718
The extent of vascularisation can be demonstrated by bone scintigraphy as well as X-ray.	0.9961190286400385
The treatment of vascular nonunions is very common.	0.9639373252902858
Mechanical stability is required, therefore a new osteosynthesis is desirable.	1.0967519344172207
Osteoporosis caused by inactivity and dislocation increases the rate of complications.	0.8016081980554906
Much more difficult problems are encountered in treatment of unreactive and avital pseudarthrosis, particularly in cases with a defect of bone substance.	1.0975026325842845
These defects can be treated with a segment transfer and a fibula-to-tibia operation.	1.0270881131660667
Extracorporal lithotripsy has been established as a new method in treatment of active and vascular nonunions.	1.143765791435493
Former osteosynthesis is not a contraindication.	0.9109108514924521
Stability and immobilisation are necessary.	0.5234362020841601
Treatment in the low-frequency magnetic field shows no effect.	0.9579893551108528
Correct biomechanical and biological osteosynthesis with proper attention paid to location, quality of bone and asepsis can avoid the development of a pseudarthrosis.	1.0427097395061584
Aim of the study: The goal of this study was to assess the prevalence of ophthalmological abnormalities in 10 year old survivors with extremely low birthweight of 500-999 g. In addition the association between retinopathy of prematurity and other ophthalmological disorders was studied.	1.0473633472580988
Background: Although the majority of surgeons regard Hartmann's operation as therapeutic standard in perforations of the colon complicated by peritonitis this procedure has been critically discussed in recent years.	1.2928794815773557
Advocates of one-stage techniques criticized bad postoperative results (high morbidity and mortality) and long-term outcome (low rates of intestinal restoration).	1.2043610869798191
The aim of our study was to investigate whether the late results after Hartmann's operation justify this criticism.	0.9644465961075808
Method: From 1982 to 1997 Hartmann's operations were performed in 103 patients for colonic perforations.	1.1031257173702635
In 63 % of cases inflammatory diseases caused colonic complications.	1.1801791958604761
The average Mannheimer Peritonitis Index (MPI) was 19.	0.916377944116455
Seventeen patients died postoperatively (mortality: 16.5 %).	0.81002716164961
In 69 patients (80 %) intestinal restoration could be performed after an average interval of 122 days (complication rate: 6 %, no mortality).	1.3092272607883282
On follow-up, patients were asked to give information on their general state, changes of housing, abdominal complaints, and quality of life.	1.1025822786266255
Results: Data on 93 % of patients could be obtained.	1.352384369966637
The median follow-up time was 75 months.	0.8896245507354099
Eleven patients had died; the remaining 72 were investigated.	0.9965013900415903
86 % described the quality of their lives as good or very good; only 11 % indicated severe loss of activity.	1.0621886014582154
Quality of life did not differ between patients in whom intestinal continuity had been restored and those in whom it had not been restored.	1.122416431745408
Anastomotic strictures developed in 7 % of cases, always after stapled anastomosis.	0.964919351821675
Conclusions: According to our results, long-term outcome after Hartmann's operation is good.	1.2208727799678685
80 % of patients underwent intestinal restoration with low morbidity (6 %) and no mortality.	1.3722521576496647
A great majority of patients indicated the quality of their lives as good or very good: this assessment was not dependent on restoration of intestinal continuity.	0.9955640921585601
Tibial torsion defects are usually not clinically evident and, hence, are often overlooked.	1.0934300876433365
Clinical examination and CT scan have proved to be the best ways of measuring static tibial torsion, whereas dynamic measurements are usually performed in the clinic and the "gait laboratory."	1.1662653729193324
Only few studies have determined there to be a connection between a torsion defect in the lower leg and expected pathological conditions of the knee and ankle joints.	1.214122031825984
However, patellofemoral instability, Osgood-Schlatter disease, osteochondrosis dissecans are increasingly being found in cases of increased external tibial torsion and arthrosis in reduced torsion.	1.0757978692127201
The aim of this study was to ascertain to what extent homeless, mentally ill subjects in Munich take advantage of available psychosocial services.	0.9131771028105902
To obtain a representative picture of the situation, the first step was to ascertain how many people in Munich are actually homeless.	1.2235920665645628
The next step was to ascertain what proportion of them are in need of psychotherapy.	0.9849995207376099
Using the standardized Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS), 146 men and 32 women were interviewed.	0.9999438228686579
The results according to the DSM-III demonstrated high lifelong and 6-month prevalence of psychic disturbances.	0.9832461276614592
Medical and social services were often enjoyed, but mostly over a short period of time in particularly critical situations.	1.0492706481042555
Women were treated more often than men.	0.7889407057271727
Elements such as age and level of education hardly influenced patients' seeking help.	0.8731572451027457
Despite a high prevalence of addictive disease, alcohol and drug clinics were rarely consulted.	0.883108373681396
The increase in the number of diagnoses was paralleled by an increase in the number of patients seeking help.	0.841127733603203
Most treatments involved schizophrenia and anxiety.	0.5486071396691357
By means of logistic regression models, predictors of the extent to which these services were used were analysed.	0.8979654317575625
We conclude that new clinical models are needed and that the aversion to the present care system is too great.	1.1466084235875027
Continued treatment occurs only rarely.	0.5056177710689164
Electrocardiographic and clinical characteristics are currently used as diagnostic criteria for the long QT-syndrome.	0.9510977001069224
In borderline electrocardiographic findings associated with unclear syncope, it is often difficult to ensure or exclude long QT-syndrome.	1.0279532846821446
Schwartz and coworkers therefore created a point system as a guide in clinical decision making.	0.7993155898279654
In recent years genetic diagnostics have entered the arena of long-QT assessment.	0.9132597337944154
Aside from new insights into the pathophysiology of the long QT-disorder, it is expected that genetic diagnostics will offer substantial help to ascertain long QT-syndrome in patients with borderline electrocardiographic and clinical findings and improve risk stratification in long-QT family members.	1.173798737224986
Performing linkage analysis, coupling of autosomal-dominant congenital long QT-syndrome (Romano-Ward Syndrome) to chromosomes 11 (LQT1/11p15.5), 3 (LQT3/3p21), 7 (LQT2/7q35), and 4 (LQT4/4q25-27) was demonstrated.	1.2149867948468929
More recently, the disease genes in long QT-syndrome 1, 2, and 3 could be identified.	1.5112908200321418
Analysis of the base-pair sequence allowed detection of several different mutations in different families illustrating genetic heterogeneity.	0.930808400993645
Aside from diagnostic aspects, molecular genetics may also guide pharmacological therapy by identifying the specific ion-channel disorder leading to QT-prolongation and sudden death.	0.8779175416000016
During the past 4 years we have demonstrated in eyes with corneal pathology that applanation tonometry (Goldmann, Perkins) generally delivers falsely low measurements in comparison to intraocular needle tonometry.	0.9130696960957236
The aim of this study was to evaluate whether impression tonometry (Schioetz) is more precise than applanation tonometry in determinating the intraocular pressure in eyes with corneal disorders.	1.0025489414900948
The case of a 24-year-old woman with a plunging ranula is reported.	0.9588848886445501
Primarily, the patient noticed extensive swelling of the neck, which had developed 3 months previously.	1.441867012025328
The polycystic, firmly attached tumor and the sublingual and submandibular glands of the right side of the neck were surgically removed.	1.0478814460242034
Pathological examination showed a retention cyst by means of a plunging ranula.	0.8631038730774038
The etiology, pathogenesis, clinical aspect and diagnostic procedures for the plunging ranula are described.	0.8919072627640169
Various therapeutic possibilities are discussed in regard to their value.	1.0950191184353715
We prefer surgical treatment with a histological examination to verify the diagnosis.	1.083297649980809
The plunging ranula originates on the sublingual gland; therefore, its simultaneous extirpation is recommended to avoid recurrences.	1.072071278365411
In extensive cases, the additional removal of the submandibular gland can be advised.	0.9737240844573513
Cranial dural fistulae are rare; when they occur, it is usually difficult to detect them at an early stage.	1.178574609390698
With a view to the question of possible progress in diagnosis we now report on seven patients with lateral dural fistulae fed by branches of the external carotid artery.	0.9693202278369647
The examination was carried out before selective arteriography using cw-Doppler sonography and colour coded duplex sonography in combination.	0.8979270497974596
Sonographic criteria for detection of hyperperfusion take account of flow velocity as well as pulsatility.	0.8146724889695406
In all cases hyperperfusion of the external carotid artery and the common carotid artery was detected.	0.9839337670608181
In most of these cases pathologic findings were also observed at the occipital artery, and more rarely in the contralateral external carotid artery or the ipsilateral vertebral artery, in addition.	1.3308263477141538
A possible source of error arising from confusion of blood vessels was present with the cw-Doppler sonography, but not for colour coded duplex sonography.	1.0797158977437384
Therefore, cranial dural fistulae characterized by a high shunt volume can be diagnosed correctly by indirect Doppler sonographic criteria using cw-Doppler and duplex sonography.	1.1773817619791695
Direct visualization of the fistula and its nidus requires additional selective arteriography, in the course of which endovascular embolization may be performed.	1.1064094431441303
Background: Echocardiography is a standard imaging technique for the assessment of heart valve disease.	1.2575301891964183
The good spatial and temporal resolution is the basis for different methods which provide information about the severity of such defects.	1.0535543036899206
Dynamic colour visualisation and volumetric measurements of regurgitant jets are a new evaluating tool for the assessment of heart valve insufficiencies.	0.8268479550510847
In Germany, as in all industrial nations, there has been an increase in the number of cases of cancer and in cancer-related mortality.	1.2568420459246155
According to the German Federal Bureau of Statistics, in 1998 nearly 213,000 persons died due to malignant cancer.	1.033200664318223
Cancer patients generally have physical and psychological dysfunction that may in turn cause a significant reduction in quality of life if treatment is performed insufficiently or not at all.	0.9731674244812035
Pain is the dominant symptom and can have serious effects on the patient and his or her family.	1.1791194708046198
Although various organizations have published treatment plans for adequate pain therapy, in many cases they are not adequately applied by physicians.	1.092822644151918
This work therefore offers a comprehensive review of pain therapy as an essential component of palliative medicine.	1.0347897705115146
This retrospective study shows the results in 30 patients of revision surgery on their reruptured ACL.	1.2467318173053417
The follow-up time was 30 months on average (range 10 - 54 months).	1.0887850345641357
The follow-up examination included subjective (Lysholm score, Tegner activity level rating score), clinical and radiological criteria and also instrumental laxity testing with the KT-1000 arthrometer.	1.1251805552079037
The overall evaluation was done according to the IKDC score.	0.7398270628109592
The follow up showed subjective and objective results almost equal to those after primary surgery on ACL.	1.0653045002073966
The IKDC score revealed certain abnormal and highly abnormal results, which demonstrated that revision ACL surgery gives poorer results than primary surgery.	0.9309401680333211
Nevertheless, we recommend reconstruction of a torn ACL even in a revision case to restore the knee function and prevent further menisceal and chondral damage and degeneration.	1.2717713876062975
Nowadays, restorative proctocolectomy is considered the "gold standard" in the surgical therapy of ulcerative colitis.	1.1101027163807222
Alternative procedures such as Brooke ileostomy or Kock pouch are limited to special indications.	0.6877569927204159
Preservation of function is the decisive advantage of the ileoanal pouch, but preservation of function is not equal to quality of life.	1.0669346552529297
Quality of life is a multidimensional concept that is difficult to define and measure.	0.887333001776894
Quality of life can only be assessed by standardized and validated quality-of-life questionnaires.	1.0493567560471968
Preoperatively, patients with ulcerative colitis have a restricted quality of life, depending on the intensity of their disease.	0.9088979958641658
Proctocolectomy is the curative therapy and improves quality of life.	0.8251226975943579
When evaluating quality of life it is not essential if patients are treated by Brooke ileostomy or restorative proctocolectomy.	1.076531640666647
The advantage of restorative proctocolectomy is the improvement in some aspects such as sexuality and physical acticity.	1.0000346643893345
The "Total Quality-of-Life Index" is not impoved.	1.1209691737288128
Preoperatively, patients should be informed that preservation of function by restorative proctocolectomy is accompanied by an increased postoperative morbidity in comparison to other procedures.	1.070857557298088
Decreased quality-of-life results when complications occur postoperatively that cannot be controlled over a long period of time.	0.8494155922692727
In some cases excision of the ileoanal pouch may be the most sensible way of solving the problems.	1.0401168000603953
On the other hand, patients without complications and good function after ileoanal pouch procedure may achieve a quality of life comparable to that of healthy controls.	1.1026873617033732
Preoperatively, patients should be aware of this risk-benefit relationship and should share the responsibility of the decision for or against restorative proctocolectomy.	1.0368296695531374
The objective of this investigation was the experimental determination of the contact pressures in the hip joint for characteristic phases of the gait cycle.	1.064707978434941
The joint forces determined in vivo with telemetric endoprosthesis by Bergmann et al.	0.773549048928485
(1993) were converted into a pelvic reference system, based on kinematic gait analysis.	0.94930506722573
In eight cadaveric hip joints (age 18-75 yrs.)	0.9362585533179881
the reaction forces were applied corresponding to four phases of the gait cycle (heel strike, mid-stance, heel off, toe off) and the pressure distribution determined with FUJI pressure sensitive film.	1.0312470444473072
We found maxima of 10 MPa during mid stance.	0.6728862447405894
The areas of highest pressure were located in the ventro-superior aspect of the acetabulum (anterior part of the acetabular roof) and in the dorso-inferior aspect of the lunate surface.	1.1582463513893209
The pressure distribution was relatively constant during the four phases and the maxima did not vary proportional to the applied load.	0.9342315533385062
The normal pressure distribution in the hip appears to be determined by the physiological incongruity of the articular surfaces and the inhomogeneous bony support of the acetabulum.	1.1486329507830422
During operative interventions this normal load transfer should be restored as accurately as possible.	0.6758741909243317
In spite of its serious sequelae, volatile substance abuse (VSA) attracts very little public attention in Germany.	0.8902008774493511
Our case report describes an adult male who inhaled propane for recreational purposes.	0.8780846718533148
Initially, he achieved short-lived euphoria and hallucinations.	0.8855982433800289
He compensated for the developing tolerance by increasing the dosage, finally consuming 5 litres of fluid propane daily.	0.8855810484662698
Getting such quantities was facilitated by his occupational access to propane.	0.6900983338783856
Since he abused the propane in an apartment house, he also exposed third parties to the danger of explosion.	0.8709053593653843
Clinical examination revealed disturbances in orientation, restricted perceptivity and concentration, reduced mnemonic performance, and psychomotor agitation.	0.9996992911399872
All these symptoms diminished during a 6-month follow-up.	0.7929395375616314
The relationship of his organic mental disorder to the abuse of propane was not clear, since he had also abused alcohol.	1.0522564216409336
Objectives The Marburg external patellotibial (Mpt) fixator is designed to temporarily protect a reconstructed distal extensor apparatus of the knee.	0.8312761391084392
It allows an early functional aftercare.	0.7030240859975584
The indications or ultrasound in the evaluation of pulmonary disorders are described.	0.8894688431832412
Clinical applications are several lung diseases in adults and especially in children.	0.9264260858532813
In specific, well-defined applications, the feasibilties of ultrasound are promising.	1.0597790602497115
Sonography provides important additional information to chest X-ray and is even superior to CT under special circumstances.	1.0354401890318108
Pulmonary sonography is a useful link between conventional X-ray and more expensive cross-sectional imaging.	1.2130379400631464
In the evaluation of pulmonary diseases at present the potential of ultrasound is not optimally used.	1.093686114081198
Traditionally oral surgeons and dentists have evaluated the jaws using intraoral films and panoramic radiographs.	0.778767090850071
The involvement of radiologists has been limited.	0.5965329461018007
In the past few years dedicated CT-software-programs developed to evaluate dental implant patients have provided a new look at the jaws.	0.9673647253294791
The complex anatomy is described and identified on human skulls and on axial, panoramic, and cross-sectional images.	0.9915849455775051
With this anatomic description Dental-CT-scans are used to demonstrate the anatomy of maxilla and the mandible.	1.0037032723273775
An overview of the technique of Dental-CT is provided, furthermore the radiation dose of different organs is explained.	1.1118282429257702
Suggestions to reduce these doses by simple modifications of the recommended procols are given.	0.8796996416906827
The debate on passive and active euthanasia has met a controversial echo both in the German-speaking media and in professional publications within recent years.	0.9171850408258471
This discussion, however, largely excluded mentally ill  patients.	1.021779796735201
Also, euthanasia advocacy groups have usually distanced themselves from  euthanasia in psychiatric patients.	0.8999902345501006
We report here two cases from our hospital in which in-patients with affective disorders committed assisted suicide during a hospital pass.	1.0910280000252397
We discuss these events under the assumption that these are cases of questionable active euthanasia in mentally ill patients whose judgement was considerably compromised by their disorder.	0.942578109618518
Definition of the problem: In Germany, the dissection rate of the deceased is distinctly lower than in many other European countries.	1.16252526666269
Although critics of autopsies use to put forward ethical objections and religious scruples, neither the Christian church nor piety stand opposite to the practise of autopsies.	0.7963593779201548
Currently undergoing a clinical trial a new miniaturized monoplane ultrasound probe potentially enhances the practicability of perioperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) without loss of echocardiographic quality.	0.8780263325746802
Methods: In the present prospective study, the nasally inserted miniaturized TEE probe was tested in 12 ventilated patients and compared with a conventional TEE probe.	1.3598591788478072
Echocardiographic quality was tested by two independent investigators by analyzing the percentage of the endocardium contour detection (<50%, 50-75%, 75-100%) in the left ventricular short- and long-axis views.	1.4137338852934886
Results: In 11 patients, more than 50% of endocardium were visualized continuously with both probes.	1.1435355471801307
Although the nasal TEE probe was inferior to conventional TEE in detecting lateral endocardium, automated endocardium detection compared well with both methods.	0.8887093680573581
Inter- and intraobserver variability in manual measurements of the left ventricular cross-sectional area was below 5% on average and differed non-significantly with regard to the method.	1.2484221792412071
In 2 patients, continuous monitoring was aggravated by repeated loss of contact between the miniaturized TEE probe and mucosa.	0.792928827072695
Conclusions: In comparison with conventional TEE, the miniaturized TEE probe provides practicability advantages without significant loss of information for cardiovascular monitoring.	1.2696123992442923
By means of modern color-coded duplex sonography (CCDS) even very small vessels can be visualized.	0.8068939385505144
Maximum resolution nowadays is about 0.5 mm diameter of the vessel.	1.1633773782617074
We compared the use of CCDS and angiography in studying of acral perfusion.	0.9351233120895662
Besides morphologic criteria, hemodynamic criteria were recorded.	0.6574700505578744
Arteries in healthy fingers appear as long and straight vessels with a clearly defined border.	0.8316017666628953
The physiological maximal blood flow velocity exceded 20 cm/s.	0.6726702941447195
CCDS revealed tortuosity of finger arteries as typical finding in thrombangiitis obliterans.	0.7294720817277957
Segmental stenosis can either be identified morphologically or quantified by measurement of the flow velocity with poststenotic maximal systolic velocities of less than 20 cm/s or by the acceleration of the blood flow within the stenosis, as proven by angiographic examinations.	1.015060040871545
CCDS is suitable for evaluation of acral perfusion in patients suffering from secondary Raynaud's syndrome.	0.7364357895315417
Apart from diagnosis of disturbed acral circulation, other possible applications of CCDS are in in the surgical field, for example replantations in hand or finger surgery.	1.064544805347213
The discussion of the Osheroff vs Chestnut Lodge court case in the "American Journal of Psychiatry" raised the question whether individual psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy is the appropriate treatment for severe depression.	0.9638811829635023
A summary of the crucial points and a review of the clinical and scientific implications of this case is presented.	1.1840030813751592
In addition, the difference between psychiatrists and psychotherapists regarding the assessment of depressive disorders is examined by analysing results of the ICD-10 research criteria study.	1.0518017186222457
In the case of one patient with dysthymia (ICD-10 RC: F34.1) psychotherapists tended more towards a reactive or neurotic etiology than psychiatrists.	1.0135416935746204
By contrast, the percentage of clinicians suspecting an endogenous etiology and thus, diagnosing a psychosis and starting a psychopharmacotherapy was markedly higher among psychiatrists.	0.9970930927919048
In conclusion, the integration of different conceptualizations and treatment modalities is emphasized as an essential task for both psychotherapists and psychiatrists.	1.0462530538882577
For certain patients, an integrated therapy may be more effective.	1.1141163026921548
A 43-year-old patient was admitted for severe claudicatio in his right leg, doppler ultrasound and angiography revealed an occluded right common iliac artery.	1.030802421178308
Using the cross-over-approach from the contralateral side, it was possible to navigate a guide wire through the occlusion, and after passage with an excimer laser an ipsilateral retrograde puncture with placement of a sheath was performed.	1.0852307457990622
In order to protect the the aortoiliac bifurcation, a primary stent implantation of the occluded side was carried out using the kissing balloon technique.	1.076626849375514
Afterwards three stents were placed.	0.5253222437524312
Subsequently the patient completely improved; treadmill exercise test and duplex sonography showed good results.	0.7774339582125258
Conclusion: Using the kissing balloon technique, laser-assisted recanalisation of iliac artery occlusions even involving the aortoiliac bifurcation compare favorable to other more invasive treatments.	1.0671566416570086
A surgical procedure can thus be avoided.	0.8876463042201219
The typical MRI features of the most common pancreatic diseases, such as pancreatitis and adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, have been established.	1.224034150932843
However, even in these common pancreatic disorders, MRI correlation with the underlying pathology is limited for clinical reasons.	1.3047976704717563
We emphasize MR-pathological correlation of inflammatory and neoplastic pancreatic changes, including pancreatitis, adenocarcinoma, acinar cell carcinoma, rare cystic and solid pancreatic neoplasms, and islet cell tumors.	1.0660438889168304
By highlighting the correlation of key pathological features with MR findings, a better understanding of the MR appearance of pancreatic pathology can be provided.	1.0149976379053878
In addition, MRI may prove a powerful tool in detection and characterization of pancreatic tumors.	1.0967448842362237
Background: The implantation of a femoro-popliteal bypass graft represents the gold standard in the management of arteriosclerotic occlusive disease in the femoro-popliteal region.	0.9629162781351293
Application of interventional techniques has permitted the development of a novel, endovascular implantable bypass system.	0.9273908147041049
The device is placed within the lumen of the superficial femoral artery.	0.6977076347706641
The present study investigated the technical properties of the new system in cadavers, with subsequent evaluation of its application in humans.	1.28304249802672
Methods: The endopass consists of a thin-wall polycarbourethane tube with a total length of 53 cm.	1.1222275489010791
The distal end is connected with a self-expanding stent prothesis 4 cm in length.	0.8310082647376262
Endovascular implantation is performed through a groin incision.	0.7199580381697892
Following antegrade ringstripper-TEA, the endopass is introduced into the femoral artery after placement of a guide wire.	1.026708667667754
The proximal anastomosis is performed surgically.	0.624127392728799
Results: The technical requirements and feasibility of the system were tested on 12 cadaver extremities.	1.2241308927298111
Implantation of the device proved technically successful in seven of eight extremities with significant occlusion of the superficial femoral artery.	0.9257661476662543
The most important problems included the complete ringstripper-TEA, the placement of the guide wire following the TEA, and the expansion of the endopass.	1.1391568351818495
Following approval by the ethics commission, the endopass was implanted in five patients between June 1997 and March 1998.	1.0571362010861494
In three patients, the endopass remained patent and has functioned well.	1.1074354574397216
One patient with poor vascular outflow suffered an early noncorrectable occlusion, while in the remaining case, perforation secondary to the ringstripper procedure forced us to abandon the attempt.	1.0847816047888308
Conclusion: Experience from the cadaver study and initial human applications confirm the feasibility of this method.	1.1524720897506395
Further development and methodological improvement, however, are necessary requiring additional, larger studies on patients.	1.0938886026570895
Introduction: There is no data available on the action of etomidate on ion currents in human neuronal cells.	1.2212247660475786
Therefore the effects of etomidate on a human neuronal delayed rectifer potassium current were investigated.	0.7832233877479445
In order to evaluate patients' exposure to radiation in computed tomography, dose quantities such as the computed tomography dose index (CTDI), multiple scan average dose (MSAD) and dose free in air on the axis of rotation are used.	1.0832415043302228
The CTDI and the MSAD, derivable from the CTDI, are a good measure for the absorbed doses in the examined volume, but they do not take the biological sensitivity of the organs into account and do not describe the radiogenic risk that is actually relevant for patients and doctors.	1.0525315327417861
The dose on the axis of rotation is not an accurate measure of the effective dose and the radiogenic risk.	0.9779887437280097
The declaration of a limit for the dose on the axis of rotation should take the different regions into account, in order to guarantee acceptable image quality on one hand and to avoid an unnecessarily high risk on the other side.	1.1515529706979188
As physical dose quantities, the CTDI, MSAD and dose on the axis of rotation are useful to characterize and differentiate between programs and systems concerning radiation exposure.	0.918196629886507
Prognosis of patients surviving acute myocardial infarction has substantially improved over the last two decades.	1.0938743295351898
However, stratification of patients at risk for death due to arrhythmic events remains a clinical challenge.	1.1949632582706584
Due to the important role of the autonomic nervous system in the genesis of sudden death, autonomic markers such as heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity have recently gained attention as risk stratification parameters.	1.0292514299449795
The present study reports the results of noninvasive risk stratification in 411 consecutive postinfarction patients treated due to contemporary therapeutical guidelines with a high proportion of patients discharged with a patent infarct related artery.	1.093925189990543
The diagnostic arsenal of risk parameters comprised heart rate variability, baroreflex sensitivity, and more traditional markers such as non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, left ventricular ejection fraction, and ventricular late potentials.	0.9577741690221554
Patiens were followed for a mean of 33  +/- 21 months.	1.0524802798869248
Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that left ventricular function, both autonomic markers, and the patency of the infarct related artery were independent predictors of the prospectively defined primary study endpoint, i.e., all-cause mortality plus ventricular tachyarrhythmic events.	1.0728421782900937
With respect to the secondary endpoint (ventricular tachyarrhythmic events), left ventricular function, heart rate variability, and infarct vessel patency were independent predictors.	1.1833770762290905
Ventricular late potentials and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia had no predictive value with respect to ventricular tachyarrhythmic events.	0.8496083979580406
These findings from a large prospective long-term study demonstrate the value of markers of cardiac autonomic tone in identifying infarct survivors at risk for malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death.	0.9326417010612839
K+ Channels and Cardiotoxicity of Drugs: Implications for Drug Toxicity Assessment - The time required for repolarization of the ventricles can be measured as the QT interval of the ECG and is determined primarily by activation of the delayed rectifier K+ current (IK), which consists of a rapid component (IKr) and a slow component (IKs).	1.190349002540552
Drugs that block cardiac IKr prolong the cardiac action potential (AP).	0.6405895512853066
Prolonged repolarization is detected as a longer QT interval on the ECG.	0.7849549356017309
During prolonged APs, increased inward currents induce early afterdepolarizations, which increase the risk of Torsades de pointes (TdP) cardiac arrhythmias.	0.9798675210199166
TdP arrhythmia is characterized by an apparent twisting of the electrical axis around the isoelectric line.	0.8469048734881249
It has a rate of 150 to 250 beats/min and it can occasionally degenerate into ventricular fibrillation that may be fatal.	0.9822098788409633
The incidence of drug-induced TdP arrhythmias is highest among class IA and class III antiarrhythmic agents.	0.8815124149900126
However, under certain clinical conditions, also several non-cardiovascular medicinal products induce QT interval prolongations in the ECG or TdP arrhythmias.	1.1367389836155324
Since all drugs known to cause TdP block IKr, an early evaluation of possible effects on APs of cardiac myocytes expressing IKr channels during the developmental phases of novel drugs seems to be recommended.	1.0596254447324998
If in-vitro electrophysiological studies show the new active substance to induce AP prolongation and/or K+ channel blockade in appropriate models and at relevant concentrations,  either further development of the new active substance may not be justified or the risk factors predisposing to TdP arrhythmias should be taken into account in further clinical studies.	1.1043288866041723
Carcinoma of the penis is a malignant epithelial tumor of ominous prognosis if not adequately treated.	0.9829561570777554
To a large extent the probability of positive lymph nodes is determined by the grade of the primary lesion.	1.0911993236527011
In turn the number of positive nodes greatly influences the survival.	0.8067416413820571
In the past the complications of radical ilioinguinal lymphadenectomy have decreased their timely indication.	0.9363294609766053
If delayed lymphadenectomy is performed, the survival rate is reduced by approximately 50 % as compared to the results of immediate lymphadenectomy.	1.1698103711766632
The modified inguinal lymphadenectomy described by Catalona leads to less complications.	0.689214725036417
If performed without delay it should lead to improved survival in patients with higher stage and high grade penile cancer.	1.011191068575764
Recently suggested employment of adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherpy may further enhance the survival.	0.7137857874653932
On the basis of existing models for psychodynamic diagnostic evaluation and psychoanalytic interview technique and of the theoretical concepts of the 5 axes of the OPD diagnosis, a new type of the psychodynamic assessment interview is presented.	1.1074885025585244
The examination is structured in 5 phases: the opening scene, exploration of specific examples for relationships, exploration of experience of self and others, of therapy motivation, and finally clarifying the preconditions for treatment and the ability for insight.	1.1650540764373465
The syndrome diagnosis according to ICD 10 is completed in a final phase.	0.8667806218871686
This psychodynamic-diagnostic assessment interview is recommended, apart from the use for OPD diagnosis, for use a clinical instrument.	1.0423746276487473
Cryptococcal meningitis is one of the most frequent forms of meningoencephalitis in AIDS patients.	0.8960225688467801
Before the introduction of triazol antibiotics like difluconazole, the frequency of this meningitis among AIDS patients was 5-10%, yet declined during the last years.	1.1624396422933325
Clinically, nonspecific signs of a meningeal inflammation predominate while focal neurological signs are rare.	0.9270509310385311
Rapid institution of high-dose antimycotic therapy is the keystone to improve prognosis and decrease mortality.	1.0742265658864794
Antimycotics of choice are amphotericin B, fluconazole, and flucytosin.	0.978866772456225
Diagnosis is established by detection of cryptococcal antigen in cerebrospinal fluid, microscopic demonstration of cryptococci using India-ink, and cryptococcal cultures.	0.8579443854930465
Recent developments aim to improve antimycotic therapies.	0.7006172189980053
During the last years, life-long secondary prevention with difluconazole was established.	0.9066548222918805
Cryptococci which are resistent against fluconazole and amphotericin B are a special challenge, yet fortunately are rare.	0.8788938187822504
Longterm outcome of patients is determined by the progression of the underlying immunsuppression.	1.162159349308837
Therefore, combination of secondary prophylaxis with modern antiviral substances is important.	1.10332080239378
Clinical decision analysis in patients with suspected cryptococcal meningitis is presented using methods from evidence-based medicine.	1.0254019297696677
The effect of aprotinin (2000000 IU as a bolus +500000 JU/h until the end of the operation) on transfusion requirements and coagulation parameters in orthotopic liver transplantation (study group: n=9; placebo group: n=9) was investigated in a randomised, double-blind study.	1.0150988962993581
Coagulation parameters were monitored intraoperatively using a mobile laboratory.	0.8064032609690184
In contrast to the published results, no effect on transfusion requirements could be demonstrated.	1.146672149933632
