Although there are a few isolated reports in the literature suggesting that sugar beet pollen is highly antigenic, hypersensitivity to components of sugar beet is not a common disease.	1.021906836915816
We report a 29-year-old man with a history of atopic dermatitis who developed both contact dermatitis and allergic rhinitis from sugar beet pollen through his job in a seed nursery.	0.9926763074195344
Establishing nursing science at German universities has become more and more consolidated.	0.794124171660848
At the beginning of this establishment there was an evident backlog especially compared to angloamerican and scandinavian countries.	0.9645998136793302
Today - 1997 - more than 40 nursing science courses exist at German high schools and universities.	1.0885812318083083
Active glucocorticoids (GCS), such as cortisol or corticosterone, are a prerequisite for the induction of surfactant synthesis in the fetal lung.	1.1383091950680606
In fetal serum, biologically inactive metabolites (cortisone or 11-dehydrocorticosterone) outweigh the active forms.	0.7905090341558716
In this study we demonstrate with organoid cultures of fetal rat lungs that the reductive side of 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11-HSD) regulates the intracellular activation of GCS.	1.0739667199329017
The inhibition of 11-HSD by the licorice extract glycyrrhetinic acid completely inhibits this central metabolism.	0.7480956390805176
On the other hand, GCS induce the reductive activity of 11-HSD and, therefore, they increase their own activation by positive feedback.	1.054365586865226
In a community sample of 394 eldery aged 61 years and older from East and West Germany, diseases, contacts with general practitioners and specialists, the use of medicine, attitudes regarding health and illness, the subjective health, psychic problems, social support, social integration, social burden, and socio-demographic variables were assessed.	1.1267777758377409
Based on these data the determinants for the contact of physicians and the use of medicine were analyzed.	0.8653939850027131
The results confirmed the frequency of multimorbidity in the elderly; on average we found three different diseases at the same time for each person.	1.227895255062817
In nearly 10% of the sample we found seven diagnoses existing at the same time.	1.059138802670993
88% had contact with a general practitioner at least once a year, 97% had contact either with a general practitioner or with a specialist once a year.	1.1191934888000064
55.8% took at least one medicine each day.	0.9311297018401176
The number of diseases existing at the same time was the most determining variable for the contact of physicians and the use of medicine.	0.9568966219912705
Furthermore, the elderly had more contact with physicians and took more medicine if they thought they were susceptible to diseases in a high degree, and if they rated their own health as poor.	1.205059738860569
Fewer contacts with physicians and a lower use of medicine were found in those elderly that rated health behavior as little useful, that had low control beliefs regarding their own health, and that experienced only a low degree of health-related limitations in their everyday life.	1.1686309079966355
Furthermore, we found a higher use of medicine if there was little social support.	1.3420237078794786
There were no significant age-related or sex-related differences regarding the contact of practitioners or the use of medicine.	1.1514928551165124
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD: Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) are chronic inflammatory and frequently relapsing diseases of the gut that ultimately lead to destruction of the intestinal tissue.	0.9378400865782028
Recent evidence suggests that a pathologic activation of the mucosal immune system in response to antigens is a key factor in the pathogenesis of IBD.	1.0035851308729955
Furthermore, changes in cell migration and cytokine production appear to contribute to the perpetuation of IBD and the postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease.	1.0643244852942144
Based on recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD, several new therapeutic strategies are currently being tested in clinical practice, including recombinant anti-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-, IL-10, IL-11) and inhibitors of cell adhesion molecules (ICAM), proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-12) and their receptors (TNF, IL-6R).	1.2351545203886305
Dysregulation of apoptosis may play a major role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).	0.6408157523441134
A defective clearance of apoptotic cells or inappropriately high rates of apoptosis may lead to a pathologic accumulation of abnormal cell material with a secondary autoimmune response.	0.89693678133606
Experimental findings in apoptotic keratinocytes and C1q knock-out mice suggest an important role of C1q in the clearance of apoptotic cell material.	0.9878832696162735
In addition, there are several links between C1q and SLE: Most the patients with C1q deficiency develop a SLE-like syndrome.	1.1676740783749695
SLE itself often causes secondary C1q deficiency and autoantibodies to C1q are detected in almost all patients with active lupus nephritis.	0.9809749904288079
These observations suggest a central role of C1q in apoptosis and in the pathogenesis of SLE.	1.0733470904012208
Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the causes and accident mechanisms that lead to injuries in infancy involving buggies and prams in order to establish strategies for accident prevention.	0.9463884554433056
The discussion about the implementation of telemedicine and teleresourcing and its consequences has been under way for some time now.	0.8999858059635519
The rate at which telemedical applications are being developed, leaves little time for consideration of the economic, scientific and social aspects.	1.015982129761155
There is a need for integration of all the existing fragments into one coherent telemedical concept.	0.919268708839621
Different aspects of telemedical concepts are discussed.	0.47405946427277923
A 34-year-old woman who was separated from her husband, was killed by him by strangulation and several stab wounds in the chest.	0.9480169203773556
The post-mortem examination was carried out approximately 5 h after death.	0.8289396521583768
At the place of discovery one swab of her right and one of her left neck side were taken.	0.8831684230552395
Additionally, a swab was taken out from the front side of the collar of her polo-neck pullover.	1.0852721183805125
It was obvious that the skin of the neck below the larynx showed a fabric pattern leading to the assumption that the collar was temporarily pressed between the hands of the suspect and the neck of the victim.	1.048600823576643
DNA typing (short tandem repeat-PCR) of these swabs led to the detection of mixed patterns for the swabs of the neck and the collar which matched the patterns of the victim and the suspect.	1.1606900948303025
A prospective randomized clinical trial was performed to evaluate the use of self-reinforced absorbable composites (Biofix) in the fixation of ankle fractures.	1.2723327333725203
The aim of this study was to demonstrate that fixation with Biofix rods and screws is as good as the standard A. O. fixation.	1.097110893105928
The benefits of Biofix rods and screws are: a reduction in costs since no secondary operation is needed, prevention of stress-shielding and thereby diminishing the risk of bone porosity.	1.079484892536839
Patients aged between 16 and 75 years old with closed, non-comminuted fractures of the lateral and/or medial malleolus and dislocation of the fracture fragments greater thean 2 mm were included in the study.	1.072020060065903
22 patients were treated with Biofix rods and screws and the control group of 19 patients with a standard technique.	1.276069191279222
After 3, 6 and 12 months, rontgenograms were taken.	0.9546249917219795
At the same time functional results were evaluated following the criteria of Olerud and Molander.	1.1193883659523136
Two patients were withdrawn from the trial for non-medical reasons.	0.9216399493510204
22 patients (12 from the Biofix group, 10 from the AO group) operated two or more years ago were contacted to see if any complications had occured since they were last seen.	1.0496143713196895
In 4 cases a Biofix screw broke down just beneath the head during insertion.	0.8080796127164535
This did not result in an insufficient fixation of the fracture.	1.0493985640082049
There were no early post-operative complications.	1.0317729173054582
The functional and rontgenological results in both groups were equal.	1.1036274257988532
In three cases a sterile sinus developed at the site of screw insertion.	0.9255086570898611
Biofix rods and screws, made of polylactic acid, are a good alternative for the fixation of fractures of the ankle.	1.1820672066210596
The use of resorbable fracture fixation material has the advantage that a second operation to remove osteosynthesis material is not necessary.	1.0324205347470061
The long term results are good.	1.0613789017118131
There is, however, a possibility of development of tissue reaction to the resorbable material.	1.0740827575308693
In current textbooks of dermatology, lichen amyloidosus is said to be a papular, intensely pruritic type of amyloidosis of unknown aetiology.	0.9293425118930172
When this concept was developed, there was no way of discriminating between the different types of amyloid.	1.0176025040105035
It is now known that amyloid in lichen amyloidosus is not derived from immunoglobulins or serum proteins, as it is in systemic amyloidoses, but from keratin peptides of necrotic keratinocytes.	1.0937281110904293
Even several years ago, chronic scratching was invoked as a possible cause of damage to keratinocytes in lichen amyloidosus.	0.9133481974366077
In support of this hypothesis, four cases are presented.	0.9706897697659373
Apart from amyloid in the papillary layer, all biopsy specimens revealed histopathological signs of chronic scratching (epithelial hyperplasia with hypergranulosis and compact orthokeratosis, coarse collagen in vertical streaks in the stratum papillare), such as are also found in prurigo nodularis and lichen simplex chronicus.	1.006316882342275
Lichen amyloidosus is considered to be a variant of these conditions.	0.9795394811904096
Just as in prurigo nodularis and lichen simplex chronicus, pruritus seems to be the cause and not a symptom of the papular skin lesions.	1.0444008688458812
Consequently, treatment of lichen amyloidosus should not be directed at removing amyloid, but at improving the pruritus.	1.2039276965919454
Ulcers in chronic venous insufficiency, especially in postthrombotic syndrome, are often resistant to compression therapy.	1.1138761342374228
They can be treated effectively by the dermatologic surgeon with a fairly simple operative procedure.	0.9289733129514366
The removal of the ulcer together with the extensive lipodermatosclerosis by Humby knife (shave-therapy) and immediate grafting with a meshed split skin graft - possibly in combination with ligation of insufficient perforator veins - yields very good success rates.	1.0220100561201089
The results in 13 patients (18 legs) with an average follow up period of 11 months (up to 20 months) are reported.	1.5686200713727525
The literature from 1990-1997 and 3 personal cases are reviewed to give an update on findings and current therapy for adder bites.	0.9596131477713746
Bites of the adder (Vipera berus) are rare.	0.8661578404482291
Symptomatic treatment usually leads to complete restitution, death due to adder bite is rare.	0.7405116127270156
The main venom effect is the development of - sometimes severe - edema, hemolysis and disseminated coagulopathy, very occasionally followed by lethal renal failure.	1.1292644982869129
Significant intoxication is very unlikely if 2-3 h after the incident, no signs of intoxication can be found.	1.1090042903035047
Background: The use of high-tech communication is undoubtedly growing and has become established in almost all sciences and research fields.	0.9586757482445404
This article surveys the possibilities for scientific data-exchange via the Internet, the world's largest computer network.	1.0343406753366604
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are known to exhibit far less cardiac side effects than tricyclic antidepressants.	0.9428349486043051
We report three cases in which the SSRI, paroxetine, induced clinically relevant ECG changes in patients with high risk profile.	1.0670093003941448
In two cases an increase in QTc time was observed, severe bradycardia was also observed twice.	1.1097115073172878
Objective: Cultural detection of Bordetella pertussis is not very helpful in the management of patients with whooping cough, since culture takes three to five days until results are available, and only about 30-60% of patients may be detected by this method.	1.2134940950609423
In order to improve the laboratory diagnosis of whooping cough, different protocols for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were developed.	1.00013345947381
With the introduction of each new technique for registering eye movements, the question arises concerning whether these provide a reliable and accurate alternative for the  diagnosis of labyrinthine dysfunction when compared to the most commonly used electro-oculographic technique.	1.0893268268750673
To answer this question we compared mean slow-phase velocity (SPV) using three different recording techniques: electro-oculography (EOG), video-oculography (VOG) and infra-red oculography (IROG) during four different types of examinations.	1.0268976587167256
The examinations were the eye target tracking test (ETT), horizontal and vertical optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) tests and the rotating chair test of the horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex (HVOR).	0.9832930441236385
For the ETT tests the VOG provided consistently higher mean SPV values with low variance, presumably because of the accuracy and stability of the calibration.	0.9715123920956382
For the horizontal OKN and VOR rotating chair tests no significant differences were found between the mean SPV obtained with the different recording techniques, although the IROG recordings were associated with a larger variance.	1.059851906483687
Vertical OKN mean SPV was consistently lower with IROG and VOG techniques presumably because of non-linearities and resolution limitations inherent in these techniques.	0.8045109125535822
These results indicate that the EOG technique despite its disadvantages of noise, time to apply and variability of calibration still provides an inexpensive, reliable and accurate means of measuring slow-phase eye movements.	0.9714152902482655
Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the plasma levels of the circulating adhesion molecules sICAM-1 and sE-selectin could serve as early predictors of developing sepsis and its severity.	1.0324905379337423
Problem: The data model given in the  DICOM standard is examined unter the aspect of system integration.	1.1297528385415716
Semantic properties of the IODs (information object definitions) and their relationships are investigated.	1.105464433778169
Thoracic disc herniation is rare.	0.5137220876589833
Pain is the most common initial symptom, followed by sensory disturbances and motor involvement.	1.1609047358207754
By the time of diagnosis, 90% of the patient have signs of spinal cord compression.	1.3304788019447
A 42-year-old woman was operated on because of shoulder pain.	0.9883866973538045
During her stay in hospital, the patient first demonstrated uncharacteristic pain and after 2weeks an incomplete paraplegia caused by herniation of the T10/11 disc.	1.012918731031533
Degenerative changes have been considered to be a cause for spontaneous quadriceps tendon rupture.	1.0299815195316928
Aim of this study is to investigate the microvasculature of the quadriceps tendon by injection techniques and immunohistochemical methods (antibodies against laminin) with regard to the pathogenesis of tendon degeneration.	1.127336314083747
The blood supply of the quadriceps tendon arises from descending branches of the lateral circumflex femoral artery, by branches of the descending geniculate artery and by branches of the medial and lateral superior geniculate arteries.	1.036824837742304
Blood vessels penetrate the tendon from the surrounding connective tissue and anastomose with a longitudinally orientated intraligamentous network.	0.7004883855125117
Compared to the surrounding synovial layer, the amount of vessels in the tendon substance is greatly reduced.	0.9661540207803764
The distribution of blood vessels within the quadriceps tendon is not homogenous.	0.8021721591188192
The anterior or superficial part of the tendon has a complete vascular network that extends from the musculo-tendinous junction to the patella.	0.9689216432105529
Within the deep portion of the quadriceps tendon there is an oval shaped avascular area which measures app.	0.8692292064354512
30 mm in length and app.	0.7158012577169837
Within this area the immunohistochemical proof of laminin is negative.	0.7583479841691915
An explanation for the absence of blood vessels may be compressive stress caused by the patellar groove which serves as hypomochlion for the quadriceps tendon when the knee is flexed.	0.8763086280750525
The occurrence of an avascular zone within the deep layer of the tendon that is directed to the joint cavity may explain the frequency of degenerative changes in this region.	1.0292722257024682
When looking for the possible cause of distortions in values measured for the determination of breath ethanol concentration (BEC) in artificially respirated patients, consideration must be given to the humidity and temperature of the gas examined.	1.0186709648236414
In the present study, the effects of humidified and warmed and of dry and cold air on the accuracy of a newly developed BEC measuring device, as compared to a reference model and to a conventional system, were examined in a lung model.	1.161272688846571
Total or partial relapses after conventional surgical advancement of the maxilla following Le Fort I osteotomy in CLP patients are frequent and major complications.	0.9569896238100881
The aim of this investigation was to find out whether the technique of distraction osteogenesis in these patients shows more stability and whether maxillary distraction is able to replace conventional advancement.	1.04262404099742
Maxillary distraction was performed in 12 patients.	0.9611768638406513
In two cases, a Delaire mask was used to bring the maxilla forward, ten patients were treated with the extraoral distraction device designed by Polley.	1.0456904975894223
In all patients, planned advancement of the maxilla could be achieved; one partial relapse occurred.	0.9827549792105985
The results indicate that distraction osteogenesis offers the possibility of advancement of the maxilla with the required stability.	0.9196040527206764
The technique presents a major improvement which is achieved with a relatively minor surgical procedure.	0.9689384402561476
We report a rare case of primary primitive neuroectodermal tumour of the bladder in an adult.	1.0270986504495243
A huge tumour with extensions into pelvic and retroperitoneal tissue was found radiologically in a 62-year-old man.	0.8447592496532692
The patient did not complain about remarkable clinical symptoms until 4 days before admission to hospital.	0.7607863288758264
Histology of diagnostic transurethral tumour resection showed a small round-cell tumour with focal necrosis and scattered Homer-Wright rosettes.	0.8587011433362385
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that tumour cells stained positively with O13, a monoclonal antibody which recognizes the membrane glycoprotein p30/32MIC2.	0.8943103067180945
Focally, tumour cells stained positively for vimentin, NSE, S-100 protein and synaptophysin.	0.8502258354503944
The patient died 3 weeks later because of fulminant pulmonary embolism and autopsy revealed a huge, partly exophytic but mainly endophytic tumour of the bladder with extensions into the rectum and retroperitoneal tissue.	1.06190482546895
The differential diagnosis of small round-cell tumours in this location is discussed.	1.0061415953426978
Lesions of the acetabular labrum should be treated by correcting the causes.	1.0856501699316863
In a steep acetabulum where the femoral head brings the acetabular labrum under tension and traction, the acetabulum should be rotated by triple pelvic osteotomy to slightly overcorrected acetabular measurements.	0.9716789191435913
Severely diminished acetabular and femoral anteversion can also lead to tears and impingement of the labrum.	0.8478454519154025
Then rotation of the femoral neck and/or rotations of the acetabulum by triple osteotomy to 15-20  ° of anteversion are indicated.	1.0913327858541748
Our triple osteotomy technique differs from that of others mainly in the ischial osteotomy.	0.7847186831499314
It is performed from the posterior approach between the sciatic notch next to the ischial spine and the obturator foramen and is directed 20-30  ° anteriorly from the frontal (coronal) plane.	1.0109496756462688
The osteotomies therefore are placed close enough to the acetabulum to allow free rotation, but they do not interfere with the circulation of the acetabulum, and the ligaments between the sacrum and ischium are left in normal tension.	1.1359275479700013
Our normal values of the acetabular position were tested by correlating the measurements with the absence of pain.	1.0209704798900987
The optimum is reached with a CE angle and a VCA angle of 30-35  °, an angle of the weight-bearing zone of +5 to -5  ° and a migration index of 10-15 %.	1.15301006001774
Overcorrections again caused pain and should be avoided.	0.5236561433108954
Diminished anteversion of femur and acetabulum towards 0  ° also caused pain and should be corrected by triple and femoral osteotomy to 15-20  ° of anteversion.	0.8926802089240967
In earlier follow-ups of 216 hips 5-10 years postoperatively, 82.3 % of the joints showed no change in the degree of osteoarthrosis.	1.1968708396472534
Survival rate curves regarding the absence of pain demonstrated that pain was experienced again when joints were corrected insufficiently or overcorrected, while in good corrections the joints were free of pain in about 75 %.	1.0559939698134921
Background: Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy is associated with point mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that appear to be pathogenic for this disease.	1.104954018662593
These mutations affect nucleotide positions 3460, 11 778 and 14 484.	0.8568081030364979
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II (HIT type II) is an immunoglobulin-mediated, drug-induced side effect for heparin-treated patients with thromboembolic complications.	1.200643664452964
With an incidence of 1-3 %, mortality of 20 % it and permanent disability for another 20 % is a clinically relevant disorder.	1.3840759697315814
With heparin treatment or prophylaxis frequent platelet count monitoring is necessary.	0.7300280350264837
With HIT type II the thrombocytopenia is often a harbinger of thromboembolic complications in the venous or arterial system.	0.881669630427972
If HIT type II is suspected, further heparin exposure is to be stopped immediately and another anticoagulant therapy should be started.	1.0660150052187651
The two anticoagulant options in Germany are discussed.	0.865220644640389
At the same time the diagnosis should be confirmed by laboratory testing, including testing for cross-reactivity with danaparoid.	1.1449548208260576
Further therapy depends on the symptoms.	0.5052951385814961
In the case of clinical relevance of this disorder we should think about prophylaxis: strict indications for perioperative prophylaxis only use of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for routine prophylaxis, use of LMWH for thrombosis treatment and early change to cumarine.	1.0985395193873102
A patented low-temperature polymerization method for methylmethacrylate (MMA) infiltrated bone marrow biopsies is described: it has been developed from our previous MMA technique and is a patented procedure.	1.0807143352598558
Differences from the previous method are (1) removal of stabilizer from the MMA monomer before its application, (2) the use of a different starter, (3) avoidance of O2 influence during polymerization by means of vacuum exchange with N2, and (4) polymerisation in a water bath to draw off residual heat.	1.0575858711224089
After this procedure, all immunohistochemical reactions are possible provided that the previous fixation is adequate.	0.9943402821053859
The effects of different fixatives are reviewed briefly without detailed analysis.	0.7951434845781579
Technically, this plastic embedding can be performed at least as rapidly as the classic paraffin embedding after decalcification.	1.1756081455616025
The advantages over the latter method are: (1) the cells can be better differentiated because semi-thin sections can be made; (2) the immunoreactions can also be performed on the basis of semi-thin sections, which means they can be interpreted more easily; (3) morphometric analyses yield more reliable results because of the constant thickness of sections; (4) osteological examination of bone trabeculae, especially the search for mineralisation deficiencies, is possible; (5) the plastic embedding procedure is less dependent on individual instabilities in the quality of performance of the staff members involved.	1.2141625056812306
Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that the costs for additional equipment necessary remain below DM 100,000 including an excellent microtome.	1.0923444842244543
The routine use of succinylcholine for endotracheal intubation is being increasingly questioned.	0.8617878805420148
Initial studies have suggested that a combination of propofol and alfentanil without a muscle relaxant can provide good intubating conditions.	0.9239867648647605
However, most of these initial studies either did not have a double-blind design or did not include a control group with muscle relaxants.	1.2810475674750539
In this study, intubation conditions using fentanyl/propofol without a muscle relaxant were compared with the combinations of fentanyl/propofol/succinylcholine and sodium thiopental/succinylcholine.	0.9591290342429518
Nosocomial pneumonia is still a common problem, especially in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients.	1.2164545618922595
The endotracheal tube contributes substantially to the pathogenesis of pneumonia in these patients, because it facilitates microaspiration and impairs host defense.	0.9723276201073999
Common nosocomial pathogens like Pseudomonas aeruginosa are known to produce exopolysaccharides and generate a complex biofilm structure, which allows adhesion to abiotic surfaces and protection against antibiotic action.	0.9558290738945362
Multiple studies have identified bacterial biofilm on the inner lumen of endotracheal tubes, which represents a permanent source of infectious material.	1.0172912860358136
Endotracheal tubes, removed from patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia, are covered more frequently with biofilm than those of uninfected controls.	0.9338474869260636
It remains unclear whether this represents a source of infection or contamination.	0.8998711288953094
Bacterial biofilm, however, may play an important role in recurrent pulmonary infections of the intubated and mechanically ventilated patient.	1.0211633382157206
Computer-guided robot-assisted surgery in cementless total hip replacement requires exact preoperative planning at the 3D workstation Orthodoc.	0.9528799870226824
Only the Robodoc procedure allows the precise execution of the preoperative plan in surgery.	0.967238876049623
Robot-assisted surgery has been undergoing clinical evaluation at the Berufsgenossenschaftliche Unfallklinik, Frankfurt, since November 1994.	0.9908051336250998
In all 465 patients, the preoperative plan was successfully carried out intraoperatively.	1.0384373860577032
The high precision in reaming, leading to a superb bone implant contact, guarentees absolute initial stability and is likely to promote primary healing between implant and bone.	0.8819909655021643
The common and often published incidence of varus or valgus malpositioning and any fractures or fissures could be avoided through the use of Robodoc.	0.8997602173770112
Although immediate full-weight bearing was strongly recommended to the patients, no implant subsidence was seen in the regular follow-up X ray studies.	1.1352959564192673
In this study we describe 22 cases of retrograde ureteral stent placement in pregnant women with therapy-resistant flank pain due to hydronephrosis.	1.0355809216797298
Eleven were primiparous and one patient expected twins.	0.7739485476369683
Eight of 22 patients presented symptoms of pyelonephritis.	0.7365712386206569
In 21 cases the hydronephrosis was located on the right and in 4 cases it was bilateral.	1.2222962601670242
Maximal lower calix diameter was 12 mm (range 9-22 mm).	0.9320710470149901
With the exception of two cases, sonographically controlled stent placement was performed under local anesthesia without sedation.	0.8924573379513608
All patients were painfree within 6 days and were given prophylactic low dosis of antibiotic until the day of delivery.	1.0681504605113383
Renal function remained within the normal limits.	0.6663179960130079
Double-J stent displacement occured in 3 patients - of which one underwent nephrostomy.	1.1240761895744606
Postnatal examination demonstrated urolithiasis in 4 of 19 patients.	0.8366695678064415
This study provides evidence for effectiveness of retrograde ureteral Double-J stent placement as a therapeutic option in cases of severe symptomatic hydronephrosis during pregnancy with a low morbidity rate.	1.090880351037662
Between 1981 and 1994 at the Bergmannsheil Ruhr University Hospital in Bochum, Germany, we treated 145 patients with femoral diaphyseal nonunions following initial operative treatment.	0.9301501504618828
Of these patients, 138 received this initial operative treatment at an outside institution.	0.8393660297714799
The primary reconstructions for the fractures utilized plates in 112 cases, reamed nails in 24 cases and external fixators in 9 cases.	0.9204166392328625
The average age of the patients was 35 years and the mean time from the initial operative treatment was 2 years.	1.3969961539759224
Twenty-seven patients (19 %) presented with a hypertrophic nonunion and 118 (81 %) with an atrophic nonunion.	1.2289562562810814
There was a significant correlation between primary "classic" plating and development of an atrophic nonunion (2-test: P < 0.01).	1.0173993131065362
We observed 34 wound infections (23 %) with no significant correlation to the type of primary osteosynthesis.	1.166315332176609
We determined that 73 of the pseudarthroses were due to improper osteosynthesis techniques.	0.6708685898514668
Of these cases, 41 % involved the use of plates, 83 % involved the use of reamed nails, and 78 % involved the use of external fixators.	1.1194224430851845
Fracture location near the diaphyseal-metaphyseal junctions was common in this problematic group.	0.7528943210783644
Ninety-two percent of all plates led to atrophic nonunions.	0.8057275729442473
There were 21 open fractures and of these 90 % (n = 19) developed an atrophic pseudarthrosis and 29 % (n = 6) developed a wound infection.	1.2409392555384915
Fifty-seven (39 %) of all patients had additional injuries, but we found that did not increase the risk of disturbed bone healing.	1.2394445635349194
Our revision operations focused on the elimination of wound infections, refreshment of bone healing, and improvement in fragment stability.	0.955318415165051
Only 28 % of all "classic" plates and 11 % of all external fixators were changed to an intramedullary implant at the time of the first revision surgery.	1.275563598512355
Hypertrophic nonunions required a mean of 1.3 revision operations to achieve bone healing whereas a mean of 2 revision operations were necessary to fuse atrophic bone ends (P < 0.05).	0.9723722507765129
In cases of diaphyseal pseudarthrosis healing time was not affected by the type of osteosynthesis used for primary reconstructions.	0.8986635300374664
Since lack of fracture healing can often already be observed directly from postoperative X-rays, we recommend that revision procedures be performed early.	1.1022125460291379
The prolonged length of time to care for femoral nonunions underlines the importance of appropriate primary fracture treatment.	0.8592196055754183
That takes into consideration both the biomechanical and the biological aspects of bone healing.	0.9019756253539302
Background: In a prospective trial (October 1996 - April 1998) the effect of octreotide and tamoxifen on the recurrence of pancreatic carcinoma after R0 resection was evaluated.	1.2057506756159944
Methods: Patients with a local recurrence after curative resection of ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were treated with 100 µg of octreotide three times a day and tamoxifen 20 mg once daily.	1.2326864240112168
The median survival time, quality of life (EORTC-QLQ-30) and side effects of the octreotide-tamoxifen group were compared with a historic cohort (n = 14) of patients treated in our department (9/95-9/96) according to the "best supportive care" concept.	1.1733710930368697
Results: Recurrences were diagnosed after R0 resection in a mean time of 13  +/-  6.8 months.	1.171248190874021
Patients treated with octreotide and tamoxifen had a significantly (P < 0.05) longer median survival time (7 months; range: 3-12) vs 3.5 months; range: 1.5-5).	1.1084581822856097
The octreotide-tamoxifen group suffered less from lack of appetite, nausea, fatigue, and pain and needed fewer analgesies.	1.0495609247250264
The only side effect of the octreotide-tamoxifen therapy was moderate diarrhoe in 2 patients at the beginning of the therapy.	1.009377891457549
Conclusion: Since combined therapy with octreotide and tamoxifen can be administered comfortably for outpatient treatment, this seems to represent progress in the palliative therapy of pancreatic cancer.	1.23539903703147
Objective: To study the influence of dopexamine on pulmonary shunt and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction during major thoracic surgery with one-lung ventilation (OLV).	0.8584782370216538
Design: Prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled study.	0.994634576020258
Patients: Twenty adult patients undergoing elective pulmonary resection.	0.8310136474699944
Anaesthesia: General anaesthesia was performed using propofol, fentanyl, N2O and vecuronium.Volume-controlled ventilation was performed to maintain normocapnia over the whole investigation period.	1.0411871412581832
During OLV, the tidal volume was reduced and the respiratory rate was increased to avoid a peak airway pressure exceeding 40 cm H2O.	1.034565019169259
Furthermore the FiO2 was increased to 1,0 and the external PEEP was removed during OLV.	1.1111070923571342
Interventions: The patients received either dopexamine at 2 µg/kg/min (group A, n=10) or 0,9% saline as control (group B, n=10) after assessing the baseline values.	1.2737471112886225
Measurement and results: The following cardiorespiratory variables were recorded: Heart rate, mean arterial pressure and mean pulmonary arterial pressure.	1.0798811005602298
Cardiac output was measured by thermodilution using a continuous cardiac output thermodilution catheter.	0.8780936816618384
Arterial and mixed venous blood gas analysis were measured from simultaneously drawn samples.	0.9255106873565785
Cardiac index (CI), systemic vascular resistance index, pulmonary vascular resistance index, oxygen delivery index (DO2I), oxygen consumption index and the venous admixture were calculated using standard formula.	1.190215619056721
Furthermore, pressure-flow-curves were constructed to analyse flow independent changes in the pulmonary vascular resistance.	1.1262335833778483
Data were recorded at the following times: After induction of anaesthesia in stable haemodynamics during two-lung ventilation (baseline values, T0), intraoperatively during one-lung ventilation (T1) and postoperatively after re-establishing two-lung ventilation (T2).	0.8993563667744875
Patients characteristics, data from the preoperative lung function testing and surgical procedures did not differ significantly between the groups.	1.161219349151992
CI increased in the dopexamine group from 2,5 +/- 1,2 l - min-1 - m-2 (T0) to 3,6 +/- 0,9 l - min-1 - m-2 (T1) and 4,0 +/- 1,3 l - min-1 -  m-2 (T2).	1.1361445623599569
The course of the intrapulmonary right-to-left shunting did not differ between the groups.	0.9276495407227282
In the dopexamine-treated group the DO2I increased from 430 +/- 143 ml - min - m-2 (T0) to 652 +/- 255 ml - min - m-2 (T1) and 653 +/- 207 ml - min - m-2 (T2).	0.905962886721109
Regarding the pressure-flow-curves there was no difference during OLV between the two groups indicating no major blocking effect of dopexamine on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.	1.028681371398771
Conclusion: It is concluded that dopexamine can be used to improve haemodynamics and oxygen delivery during thoracic surgery without increasing venous admixture during one-lung ventilation.	1.1879675652011765
Functional cine MRI of the pelvic floor is a yet another modality in addition to various radiological fluoroscopic techniques.	1.0676955977570814
This article describes our own method in view of the recent literatur and provides morphometric reference values.	1.0304129277960306
Background: The influence of cyanosis, and cardiac index in children with cyanotic heart disease on their growth velocity.	1.1620110277285922
Regular examinations of prostitutes may reduce the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases in this high risk group.	0.9102463703639424
Therefore since April 1988 regular mandatory examinations have been offered by the regional health office in cooperation with the Department of Dermatology of the Ruhr-University of Bochum.	0.9584483506814708
The aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptance and efficiency of such an examination.	0.8019564389748277
The study was based on anonymous questionnaires.	1.0046238749054688
Mean age of the 80 prostitutes was 31.4; 67 of then were born in Germany.	0.9666836417367156
78 of the women always used condoms, while 71 thought that condoms prevent STDs.	1.0204679614784666
Three women suffered from a STD in the last 12 months.	1.0463918449021385
The majority the women (75 from this 80 prostitutes) did not perceive the examination as discrimination, while 71 felt the examinations were of high quality.	1.103420688524765
These results indicate that regular mandatory examinations should be part of health prevention care of prostitutes and that they are well accepted and tolerated by these women.	0.9386477149783697
Atrial fibrillation and related arrhythmias are common after cardiac surgery.	0.8760974291580766
As more and more elderly patients are operated on for cardiac diseases, the interest in this arrhythmia is growing again.	1.0664720019790628
There are some unresolved problems of this complication.	0.8551706388715701
Reevaluation of atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery by review of recent literature.	1.0108355318643103
Usually postsurgical atrial fibrillation is transient, self-limiting, and benign.	1.0669240759886516
Nevertheless, among patients affected by this arrhythmia, morbidity, mortality and costs by hospital stay are higher than without this complication.	1.1361771722143357
In addition, postsurgical atrial fibrillation can increase morbidity and mortality by itself.	1.1367584526934726
Today, general recommendations for prevention of atrial fibrillation following surgery do not exist but may be developed in the future.	1.1415780167859426
According to the clinical course, therapy has to consider ventricular rate control, prevention of thromboembolic events, and rhythm control.	1.1575280542887414
Usually therapy is restricted to the postoperative time.	0.9437625577621045
Atrial fibrillation after cardiothoracic surgery has to be respected in order to minimize overall complication rate.	1.0565819012076525
The influence of aspirin treatment on haemostasis is still under debate.	0.7624822960797174
There are doubts in emergency operations, especially in transplant patients, concerning dosage and change in medication.	1.0786369846641874
Our results are based on an analysis of the therapeutic approaches in German transplantation centres.	0.9940924785210261
The question of transplant suitability, dosage and haemostatic effects are discussed with respect to the literature.	1.0316910541820474
Some 92.11 % of the transplantation centres perform the operation even though the patient has been treated with aspirin.	1.2448649970772527
In these cases an increased bleeding tendency is tolerated and observed in 34.2 % of the centres.	1.1496502560649666
An increased mortality has not been reported.	0.8664440106350935
Most of the transplantation centres accept a dosage of 100 mg aspirin daily.	0.8672801169019614
Only 7.89 % of the transplantation centres refuse to operate on aspirin-treated patients.	0.9891889012277529
Correctly indicated aspirin treatment (for cardiac arrhythmia, embolism, or thrombosis, for example) does not contraindicate renal transplantation (daily dosage up to 100 mg).	1.0783933533146688
In elective surgery, however, a preoperative change in medication is recommended, e. g., the heparin instead of aspirin.	0.9449038331835676
Full-thickness defects of the thoracic wall following tumor resection, irradiation damage or secondary wound healing in thoracic surgery require early interdisciplinary cooperation to achieve patient-specific treatment modalities.	0.9939029924658049
Plastic surgical differential therapy allowing for sufficient soft tissue coverage, stabilisation of the thoracic wall and space filling in intrathoracic cavities, is presented and critically discussed.	1.0935854888473018
Incomplete anaesthesia is a major clinical problem both in single spinal and in single epidural anaesthesia.	1.0250204331306576
The clinical efficacy of epidural anaesthesia with augmentation (aEA) and combined epidural and spinal anesthesia (CSE) for cesarean section was investigated in a prospective randomized study on 45 patients.	1.1065811895550626
This retrospective study presents the results of 41 patients with a lateral clavicle fracture eight years after the treatment at the Staatliche Orthopädische Klinik of the LMU München in the time between 31.10.1979 and 31.10.1994.	1.2034787120022157
It could be shown that the lateral clavicle fractures, due to their variety, hold a special position among the clavicle fractures and thus need a differanciated therapeutic procedure.	0.9639995213386617
Among the operation methods the K-wire stabilisaton with cerclage was the most often chosen operation technique i.e.	0.892506329346731
The K-wire without cerclage was used in two cases.	0.8897651608308261
Twelfe fractures were treated with AO-plate-osteosynthesis.	0.8365435713313311
Three fractures had to be treated by resection, as they produced two pseudarthrosis and one serious AC-arthrosis during the conservative therapy.	1.170354171662684
92,7% of the subjective results of the 41 checked up patients were good and very good.	1.237786442437403
The clinical follow-up of 36 and the radiological follow-up of 33 patients revealed in 97% a good and very good outcome in the Boenisch-Score.	1.3529837271552951
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and multiple sclerosis are thought to stem from autoimmunological processes.	0.7817241643292767
We describe a 14 year old female adolescent, in whom both diseases manifested almost at the same time.	1.2863254511327118
A prospective long-term follow-up study in patients who had had surgical therapy for renal hyperparathyroidism was launched to investigate the results of surgical treatment and to evaluate possible correlations between preoperative laboratory values and the course of the symptoms.	1.1943615870075115
From August 1987 to December 1995, 79 patients underwent surgery for renal hyperparathyroidism.	0.8527418637016992
It was the first neck exploration for 72 patients.	1.1292684482930038
Total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation to a forearm was our preferred procedure (n = 67).	1.0173105269775646
The postoperative course of all patients is known.	1.213991437267432
We carried out one to nine reexaminations (median 4) in 74 of 79 patients.	1.1540268429030505
The follow-up period ranged from 1 month to 5 years with a median of 18 months.	1.2407056802132255
After the operation transient hypocalcaemia occurred in 84.8 % of patients.	0.9931182485114626
Postoperative hypocalcaemia correlated negatively with the preoperative levels of alkaline phosphatase and intact parathyroid hormone.	0.7457398384770668
Within the first month after surgery 60 % of the preoperatively affected patients completely recovered from pruritus, whereas the skeletal syndrome took longer to disappear.	1.1164315029731708
One year after surgery 75 % of the patients with pruritus and 79 % of those with skeletal syndrome had became asymptomatic.	1.233430917652458
After total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation, patients with preoperatively elevated concentrations of alkaline phosphatase ( > 200 U/l) experienced faster relief from joint pain than patients with preoperatively normal concentrations (P = 0.0297).	0.9973205750091475
To date 4.5 % of the patients developed recurrent hyperparathyroidism after total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation.	1.033618732723102
Morbidity of surgery for renal hyperparathyroidism is influenced by patients' risk factors.	0.9028067589829035
Postoperative hypocalcaemia correlates negatively with the grade of renal osteopathy at the time of operation.	0.8840609914878068
Preoperative concentrations of alkaline phosphatase influence the rapidity of the relief from joint pain.	0.7188759303977946
Coronary artery stenosis with need for therapy is rarely seen in childhood.	0.9793050697304726
A 15-year-old girl with hypercholesterinaemia type II a was undergoing lipid aphereses therapy (once or twice a week) since she was 6 years old.	0.9483329258221695
Single stage urthroplasty with an onlay patch graft of penile skin or buccal mucosa is an effective treatment for patients with complex anterior urethral stricture disease.	0.8446921301014129
Using buccal mucosa, operative time is substantially reduced by using a two-team approach in which one team harvests the graft from the mouth while a perineal team simultaneously exposes and calibrates the stricture.	0.9684756676955386
Excellent results can be expected using grafts urethral substitution in men with refractory bulbar strictures.	0.9132884193166486
Focal areas of severe stenosis may be excised from the graft bed.	0.81089347097922
For patients with long or dense strictures, grafts may easily be combined with other tissue transfer techniques.	0.9027173233095475
Background: As the slit-lamp technique is an restrictive method for the in-vivo examination and documentation of the multi-layer structure and the dynamics of the tear film and the cornea, e. g. during wound-healing processes, our aim was to find out whether it is possible to change the confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscope (CLSO; Zeiss) into a high-resolution confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) for the visualization of the anterior segments of the eye and the tear film by adapting a special objective system.	1.198074804809936
In order to gain information concerning the function of such a cornea microscope we examined selected patients with erosion or pterygium before and after operation and subsequent phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK), as well as some in-vitro corneal surfaces after photorefractive keratectomy (PRK).	1.08194668262699
From 3 years' experience with nearly 100 transinguinal preperitoneal mesh prosthesis (TIPP) repairs for recurrent inguinal hernia the indication, anesthesia, modification of the technique, and results are reported.	0.955990124496062
After intraoperative classification of the hernia, the TIPP repair is indicated especially in large defects of the posterior wall (L/M III).	1.0818037902007795
The procedure is easily performed under local anesthesia.	0.731545810554077
During 52 local TIPP repairs, conversion of anesthesia was never necessary.	0.8196269854928967
Important technical details include the requirement for a sufficient size of mesh (10 cm x 15 cm) and a certain caudal and cranial fixation of the prosthesis using at least three interrupted stitches for each.	1.1972307926317654
Apart from an increased number of seromas (12 %) in the early postoperative period, the results of the TIPP are comparable with those obtained after Shouldice repair for recurrent hernia.	1.1564514328623494
The rate of hematomas, infections, and testicular complications range between 1 % and 3 %.	1.2017770125335014
Considering the negative case selection of only large recurrent hernias, the TIPP repair reveals a favourably low 1-year recurrence rate of 1 %.	1.0793742055192481
If representatives of the law suspect anyone of drug smuggling by internal bodily concealment and refers the person to hospital, the doctor is requested to recover the ingested drug packets by induction of emesis with syrup of ipecacuanha or apomorphin a.	0.9197969118920359
The permission of this induction as a coercive measure is controversial.	0.7649935518991541
The policemen, the public prosecutor or the judge has to decide, whether the induction of emesis is really necessary, the physician has to declare the risks.	1.1072116756802917
Especially when there are only a few drug-containers and the person is no professial "body-packer", non-invasive diagnostic ways also can lead the evidence of incorporated drugs.	1.1226310178984464
Rupture of the drug containers leads to acute intoxication and the physician must regard the person as his patient, he has to refuse the role as medical expert for the representatives of law.	1.0909759254969833
The deformity in severe spondylolisthesis consists of two components: the parallel anterocaudad slip of the spondylolisthetic vertebra, and its tilt into kyphotic malposition.	1.0425006617389483
The influence of the two components is very different: the anterocaudad slippage has not much impact on the sagittal profile of the spine and is easily compensated for by a slight increase in lumbar lordosis.	1.1608885632184338
The kyphotic deformity has a high impact on trunk imbalance and the sagittal profile.	0.8934562171054661
There are two compensation mechanisms: hyperlordosis of the lumbar spine to its anatomical extremes and - if that is not sufficient - verticalisation of the sacral bone, performed by contracture of the hamstrings and uprighting of the pelvis around the hip joints.	1.109735467649061
The latter mechanism is followed by functional disadvantages.	0.7824929742299545
Therefore, correction of the kyphosis of L5 may be considered during operative treatment if the lumbosacral kyphosis (angle delta) is less than 85  ° and the sacral inclination less than 35  °.	1.1880031449353157
The diagnosis of malalignments of the lower extremities includes analysis of the geometry of the whole leg.	0.983453559348416
The first step in the diagnostic process is a standardized physical examination.	1.068642874214448
It provides valuable background information for an effective radiological diagnosis.	0.8692036694712086
Even with a thorough standardized physical examination it is not possible to define exactly the deformity or decide on an operative procedure.	1.0388340097207494
The diagnosis of axis deviations in the frontal plane can be measured on a conventional plain X-ray of the whole leg.	1.1639320855423059
In this view it is very important that the knee joints are in a true a. p. view independent on torsional deformities of the lower legs.	1.193219709041382
Today the gold standard to measure the torsion and length of the lower extremities is the CT scan.	0.9421509814282631
However, the multitude of analytical methods for CT measurements described in the literature do not lend themselves readily to comparison; thus, it is difficult to identify a clear method of choice.	1.1302740803446671
Not every CT measurement is better than a physical examination.	0.783480292258152
Evidence of reproducibility and accuracy is a prerequisite for useful interpretation of the results.	0.7502639316184491
Up to this point in the literature there are only reference values for the Ulm CT Method.	1.1681432073821314
One alternative is the MR scan, which avoids radiological risks, but the reproducibility and accuracy of the MRI method are not as good as for the CT method.	1.210494574477731
Another alternative is ultrasound, where recent advances in the measurement of torsion and length of the lower extremities have proven competitive with or superior to the accuracy of MRI.	1.0236110302662413
The three-dimensional determination of the torsion and length of the lower extremities by ultrasound has now assumed a leading role in the non-radiological diagnosis of malalignments of the lower extremities in children and adolescents.	0.9754309956975322
This method furthermore is increasingly being used in preoperative planning of leg deformities in adults.	0.8404739584943074
Purpose: Management of organ-confined RCC is primarily surgical.	1.0988813879770913
5-year survival rates of all stages improved from 40 % in the 1950th to 50 % in the 60th, and stagnate at 60 % in recent series.	1.4295846491010884
Paramount use of ultrasound in modern medicine has been claimed to contribute significantly to an earlier detection of RCC thus better amenable for radical operation.	0.9430400834471199
Other factors may have been strategies and general hospital care.	0.8767244195871459
However, it remains unclear whether an extended lymph node dissection as suggested vy Robson in a seminal paper in the 1960th bears any therapeutic value.	1.0684152575263235
Selected patients with minor lower limb injuries and low risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), who required cast immobilizing and did not receive medical thrombosis prophylaxis, were included in a prospective study.	1.155974631828208
The decision to give not medical thrombosis prophylaxis depended on an concept of individualised prophylaxis for patients at risk for thromboembolism.	1.0118967090076958
From March 1994 to March 1996 in 178 outpatients (118 men, 60 women, mean age 25,8 [16-39] years) a clinical examination and a colour-coded duplex sonography were performed after removel of the cast for detection of DVT of the lower limb.	1.103309417614091
A phlebographie was performed when thrombosis was suspected.	0.7020583914494644
Two patients developed a one bundle thrombosis of the calf.	0.884326376552194
Clinical appearance of lung embolism was not observed.	0.8888467573672485
These results suggest, that low risk patients with minor injuries of the lower limb and plaster cast immobilisation do not need a medical thrombosis prophylaxis.	1.1861184270179377
For the judgment of the quality of medical services and for the progress of clinical medicine the comparison of data and informations of the diagnostic and therapeutic process is demanded.	1.1486479431136796
Therefore a systematic and concrete system of documentation should be implemented in every clinic, which consists of standard nomenclature, classification, instruments of outcome measure and documentation standards.	0.9506791266689734
There are a group of problems and barriers which stand in the way of this goal.	0.9249139179659638
It is useful to build a minimum basis data set which includes core criterias of clinical dokumentation in orthopedic surgery and include this in an information system so that all of these parts are considered and that a central and comparable data pool is offered for patient care, quality management and research.	1.0512907552532347
Basal cell adenocarcinoma was first introduced as an entity in the second edition of the WHO's "Histologic Typing of Salivary Gland Tumours" in 1991.	1.1870845236755545
This tumor was first described in 1990 by Ellis and Wiskovitch from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP).	0.7719697034575425
Basal cell adenocarcinoma accounts for about 2.9% of all salivary gland malignancies.	1.189133980150084
More than 90% of the tumors are situated in the parotid gland.	1.052756106361578
Intraoral manifestations are known from case reports only.	0.8052515803460432
Tumors of the palate have been mentioned in three cases.	0.8177281948293857
Histologically this tumor can be easily confused with basal cell adenoma and the solid basaloid subtype of adenoid cystic carcinoma.	0.8539956371473264
The case presented here is a middle-aged white woman with a basal cell adenocarcinoma of the palate.	1.0831533879958566
Therapy consisted of surgical extirpation with three-dimensional safety margins and histologically proven clear resection margins.	0.8888664692844233
Knowledge at this point indicates that basal cell adenocarcinoma has a rather high probability of local recurrence (up to 50%) and a mostly lymphogenous metastatic potential for as long as  10 years after removal of the primary tumor.	1.1787407215316343
Ten year survival is around 75%.	0.736885616662656
Purpose: To study the incidence and shape of subclinical keratoconus with corneal topography in the fellow eye in the case of clinically, slit-lamp biomicroscopically and topographically diagnosed unilateral disease.	1.0209492947720489
Ischemic heart disease is the most frequent cause of death in industrialized countries.	1.0503414959691502
This is a result of persistent risk factors and aging of the population.	1.1521707403703279
Medical progress with application of conservative, surgical or interventional strategies indeed reduced the morbidity and mortality of arteriosclerotic diseases, but markedly increased the medical care costs.	1.1786998886605262
The result is a discussion about the optimal use of the different therapeutic measures under consideration of the evidence based medicine.	1.14312191622996
The ileal conduit is a simple and safe supravesical urinary diversion with few postoperative complications.	0.7891042027690501
In patients with liver disease with portal hypertension, however, the risk of recurrent, peracute conduit bleeding is increased.	1.0316964738555365
While the diagnosis is simple, several therapeutic options are available.	1.1621675343679292
In most cases the bleeding comes from stomal varices, that can be controlled with local sclerotherapy with 3% Ethoxyscerol or ligation of the bleeding vessel.	1.1238468613450714
The resection of the part of the conduit carrying the varices is an option if bleeding is life threatening or the source cannot be localised.	0.9629277896923784
If bleeding recurs excision of the conduit should be considered.	0.7547496654390891
Malignant disease must be excluded as a bleeding source.	0.768766740155212
Objectives: The cardiotoxic properties of bupivacain have been well documented under in-vitro, as well as under in-vivio conditions.	0.9744956679821583
A further mechanism of cardiovascular impairment by bupivacaine via the central nervous system gained investigational interest in animal studies.	0.8666796803479906
The aim of our study was to demonstrate the effect of a ventriculocisternal perfusion of bupivacain on systemic hemodynamic variabels and their reversability by wash-out with mock-CSF.	0.9047849822707263
In recent years, our knowledge concerning pathophysiological changes in brain metabolism after traumatic brain injury (TBI) has greatly expanded.	1.048983022815916
This, in turn, has enabled the development of specific pharmacological strategies for the supplementary treatment of brain-injured patients with the aim of reducing secondary brain damage.	1.2826365623365976
The present article focuses on the pathophysiology of TBI and the possibilities for pharmacological intervention.	0.9158525455884472
While some of the substances reviewed are presently used in the treatment of TBI, others are under experimental and clinical evaluation at different stages.	1.005993857795259
This study explored characteristic subjective experiences of schizophrenia.	0.6283249473543933
A questionnaire for self-assessment of disturbances in several cognitive and perceptual areas (the Eppendorf Schizophrenia Inventory, or ESI) was constructed and administered to first-episode schizophrenics (SCHe, n=45), negative syndrome schizophrenics (SCHn, n=45), remitted schizophrenics (SCHr, n=24), depressives (DEP, n=43), alcoholics (ALK, n=48), obsessive-compulsive patients (ZWA, n=46), and healthy controls (KON, n=57).	1.1238130016704746
Comparisons between the SCHe, SCHn, DEP, ALK, and ZWA groups and a subsequent factor analysis revealed four schizophrenia-specific dimensions: attention and speech impairment (AS), ideas of reference (IR), auditory uncertainty (AU), and deviant perception (DP).	1.1064805297048448
Further analyses suggested that the AS syndrome may represent a mediating vulnerability factor while IR, AU, and DP probably are reversible episode indicators.	0.9171425058693866
The results may contribute to refinements in the measurement of specific prepsychotic signs, thus facilitating the development of early intervention approaches.	1.0109316901439749
Introduction: The conservative treatment of the most severe cases of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) can be sometimes frustrating.	1.3150024271334069
Especially with an underlying autoimmunologic disorder, even the application of artificial tears as often as every 5 min may not prevent further damage to the ocular surface.	1.050072258597256
A microvascular transplantation of the autologous submandibular gland (SG) can be performed by a maxillo-facial surgeon as an alternative approach for those cases.	1.0917083356605966
We report 2 years of ophthalmological experience with the results of this procedure.	1.248113028880931
Aims: The predominant cause of death due to oral cancer is the failure to control local tumor due to regional tumor recurrence.	1.1473491635511726
The sequelae of surgical resection and high-dose irradiation cause substantial changes in head and neck anatomy, leading to considerable problems in the early morphological detection of recurrent disease.	1.1973510445033593
Therefore, this study evaluates the verification of cancer recurrence by means of its pathologic glucose metabolism.	1.2238565520502593
Materials and methods: We reviewed a total of 50 [18F]-2-fluordeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET) investigations performed in 44 patients who had undergone surgical resection of oral cancer.	1.2743145563440905
In 23 cases, re-staging (group A) was indicated due to suspicion of recurrent or secondary tumor manifestation.	1.0883775393817463
In 27 cases, PET served as a screening procedure (group B).	0.988463619942013
Statistic evaluation included sensitivity, specifity, positive/negative predictive value and accuracy of 18FDG-PET for the detection of tumor manifestation.	0.9446079225167694
Results: 18FDG-PET correctly identified 23 of 26 tumor sites (88%) in the re-staging group and 9 of 10 tumor sites (90%) in the screening group.	1.2572711215044465
We encountered a total number of 16 false-positive foci with an increased 18FDG-uptake.	1.0266573166656627
In six patients, 18FDG-PET detected tumor recurrence several months before a morphological correlative could be identified.	0.7576017401152796
In 5 of these 6 patients, the PET findings for the latter tumor sites determined the patient's fate.	1.146030035591742
Specificity was 63% for local recurrence, 97% for secondary lymph node involvement and 90% for distant metastasis.	1.3082079464237304
Conclusion: According to these data, 18FDG-PET is the most effective diagnostic tool in the follow-up of oral cancer patients to date.	1.1793144462260454
Due to the high prevalence of recurrent disease in the follow-up of oral cancer, either the detection of early recurrence or the identification of additional, incurable tumors may add substantially to a rational therapeutic management.	1.1572154644549113
We therefore recommend 18FDG-PET for screening and re-staging of recurrent oral cancer.	0.9627083213934859
In over 80 % of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease, the Nissen antireflux fundoplication gives good long-term results.	1.033004993170879
Dysphagia, inability to belch or vomit as well as the gas bloat syndrome are possible sequelae after fundoplication.	1.0033092457493327
The frequency of these symptoms could be reduced by modification of the original Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication into the so-called "floppy" Nissen fundoplication, a short and loose wrap of mobilized gastric fundus.	1.092301993057936
Failures of the antireflux procedure are mainly due to disruption or displacement of the wrap with the telescope phenomenon.	0.7604623368892124
Here, reoperation with refashioning of the original wrap may lead to same functional results like a primary fundoplication.	0.9412424601858627
Technical alternatives may selectively be chosen, when gastroesophageal reflux disease is complicated by fixated hiatal hernia, esophageal shortening, or serious esophageal motility disorders.	0.9315262483895205
Such specific anatomic or functional abnormalities are detected by preoperative endoscopy, barium swallow, 24-h pH monitoring, and manometry.	0.9711901054016713
Alternative techniques are mainly transthoracic repairs, including the Nissen fundoplication, Collis gastroplasty, and the Belsey Mark IV.	1.198857359453309
Modifications of the 360  ° Nissen operation are partial fundoplications like the Hill repair and the Toupet dorsal fundoplication.	0.7840260350662634
Because of a high failure rate in the long-term follow-up, application of the ligamentum teres cardiopexy and of the Angelchik prosthesis is not recommended.	1.0731426279209675
We report a sporadic case of giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) starting in a 5-year-old boy with gait disturbance.	1.162620390986502
At the age of 10 years he showed signs of a sensomotoric polyneuropathy and central neurological symptoms: intention tremor, nystagmus and visual disturbance.	0.888572753137242
The boy also had curly hair.	0.5968099648634808
Sural nerve biopsy showed many giant axons with accumulation of microfilaments, which were also found in cytoplasma of Schwann cells, endothelial cells and fibrocytes.	1.1146356308607976
Similar changes were detected in endothelial cells of a muscle biopsy, which additionally displayed neurogenic atrophy and target fibers.	1.0494123438079463
Immunohistochemically, desmin, vimentin, heat shock protein 70, and ubiquitin were not detectable in giant axons, which, however, contained neurofilament protein 68, 200 and  -tubulin.	1.1693649864864422
Our case shows that careful ultrastructural examination of a muscle biopsy may point to the diagnosis of GAN.	0.9255716775781113
The endoscopic release of the carpal ligament gives the opportunity to treat the carpal tunnel syndrome in a comfortable and minimal invasive way.	0.939055793004775
Between 1 October 1994 and 7 May 1995, 46 patients who underwent endoscopic surgery on 55 hands were documented in a prospective study.	1.1038388525487726
The following results were taken from a questionnaire.	0.8825291267104399
There were not any complaints, or the complaints were so much diminished that complete division of the carpal ligament could be viewed as accomplished in 51 of 55 cases.	1.0163659163556307
There were continuing complaints in four cases, and after an additional check two patients were operated on again.	1.1805917099663024
The advantage of the endoscopic method is the inconspicuous scar and the reduced postoperative disablement.	0.9564972579518813
For surgical removal of a malignant choroid melanoma, it is necessary to reduce systolic blood pressure to around 50-60 mmHg in order to prevent choroidal haemorrhages.	1.1720054391179393
However, blood pressure reduction is associated with the risk of cerebral ischaemia.	1.4163276181247162
We report a patient with a malignant choroid melanoma in whom waves I and II of the brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP) disappeared during surgery under controlled arterial hypotension and hypothermia (31.1 ° C).	1.0746611410784863
The waves could be recorded again immediately after the mean arterial pressure was increased from 48 to 77 mmHg.	0.959538625571153
The oesophageal temperature had dropped by 0.3 ° C at this time.	0.9805048011106529
The 2-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) showed no irregularities during this time period.	1.0232141076398247
A bilateral, reversible, apparently blood-pressure-dependent loss of waves I and II during arterial hypotension despite a normal EEG has to our knowledge not been previously described in the literature.	0.9691563331162434
The isolated loss of waves I and II with maintenance of waves III, IV, and V is unusual.	0.9929709014651268
The literature contains reports of acoustic neurinoma patients in whom only wave V could be recorded.	0.9753671075657356
This is regarded as an indication of continued impulse conduction despite the loss of waves I to IV.	0.9353793218957662
Others have observed a patient with temporary and reversible loss of BAEP wave I due to vasospasm of the internal auditory artery that apparently occurred during or shortly after manipulation of the internal auditory meatus.	1.0371506906442545
Assuming anatomic peculiarities in the blood supply to the generators of the BAEP waves, a stenosis of the basilar artery could be considered as the cause of the bilateral reversible loss of waves I and II.	1.0403025159210266
Another potential source could be the induced hypothermia, but this does not seem very likely because the patient's temperature was 0.3 ° C lower at the return of the waves than at their loss.	1.2097757107635236
In the syndrome arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia cardiomyopathy, little is known to date about the mechanism for the development of arrhythmias.	0.9834270032386218
In a group of 54 patients with documented ventricular tachycardia during longterm ECG recordings, the determinants for the development of VT and the relationship between signal-averaged ECG and the morphological characteristics of the disease are investigated.	1.1222151012664907
The analysis of the long-term electrocardiographic data includes the measurement of RR-intervals 30, 15, 5, 1min and immediately before onset of the VT, the determination of the morphology of the previous ventricular premature beats, and the frequency of the atrial arrhythmias.	1.1102781472903152
Normal values for the analysis of late potentials in the ECG signal accquisition with bidirectional filters between 40 and 300Hz were defined a maximum of 113ms for a QRS width, LAS of 38ms, and RMS40 of 16uV.	0.9724289055148139
The analysis of the long-term ECG produced monomorphic VT in all cases without previous atrial arrhythmia and in only 4 cases with previous polymorphic ventricular premature beats.	1.0280847299354048
A long-short phenomenon could only be proven in 4VT episodes.	0.917369259283305
In 84% of all tachycardias, no arrhythmia were found immediately before onset of the arrhythmic event.	1.15377100804786
According to the circadian clock, two peaks, mornings between 6 and 9h and evenings between 6 and 9h, could be determined.	1.0112795269575454
In patients, who were recently diagnosed with ARVD, a significant shortening of the RR intervals before the onset of VT as an indication of an acceleration of the sinus rhythm was observed.	1.1611318957913286
This effect could not be observed in patients with a past medical history of AVRD.	1.080364112377933
Late potentials were determined with a prevalence of 74% overall.	0.9468645393369107
Increasingly, late potentials were observed with morphologically diffuse forms of the ARVD.	1.0936546966450105
A correlation to the severity of spontaneous arrhythmias (ventricular, sustained or not sustained VT) could not be established.	0.9612495553448119
In comparison to the origin of VT in coronary heart disease, previous arrhythmias play a less important role in arrhymogenic right ventricular dysplasia cardiomyopathy.	1.0679547073616145
Most importantly, an intensified sympathetic tone before onset of VT and an increased prevalence of positive late potentials are observed.	1.081580746012194
We present the case of a 54-year-old male patient with a Syme amputation of his left leg following diabetic gangrene of the foot.	0.8454181235071072
A  local infection of the stump was treated successfully with two  endoscopic debridements and lavage.	0.9230894381099363
Additionally, the patient received local antibiotics by the application of antibiotic collagenous fleece and antibiotic chains.	1.1491190447133202
This therapeutic management combined with early weight bearing led to a stable stump.	0.9004124396045228
We describe an eighteen-months-old boy, who suffered from congenital vitium cordis, jejunalatresia, microcephaly, facial dysmorphies and psychomotor retardation in connection with a partial monosomy of the short arm of chromosome 8.	0.8650985571836164
In most cases the genesis of brachial plexus palsy is traumatic, often because of bike accidents.	1.0388916545821043
If physiotherapy and neurosurgical procedures such as nerve repair do not have the desired outcome, muscle transfer operations are possible.	0.9330030498915514
The results of our favored transfer of the trapezius muscle to compensate paralysis of the deltoid muscle will be presented.	1.0120253400896724
Preoperatively radiological, clinical and electromyographic examinations are necessary.	1.0239731607814377
Our results are based upon the clinical and radiological check ups and the subjective assessment of the patients.	1.0636582468320028
Thirty-one patients (7 female, 24 male) underwent a trapezius transfer between March 1994 and December 1996.	1.0756976452491622
The average age was 29 years (range 18-46 years).	1.1089667813805288
We performed the operations using a modification of Saha's technique.	0.6755804340494946
With the patient in lateral decubitus position and protection of the opposite plexus, a sagital skin incision is the first step, followed by the preparation of trapezius and deltoid muscle as well as the bony parts of the shoulder (acromion, clavicle, scapular spine).	1.1670435299463011
The deltoid origin is cut from the lateral third of the clavicle, the acromion and the lateral half of the scapular spine.	1.0722048541621914
The next step is transection of the root of the acromion and the lateral clavicle.	0.940995610913079
After elevation of the remaining trapezius insertions from the clavicle and scapular spine, the proximal humerus is exposured by splitting the partly detached deltoid muscle longitudinally.	1.0164723375503812
Then the acromion fragment and humerus are prepared for the bone-to-bone contact.	0.9719030872945609
In 90  ° of abduction the acromion fragment with its trapezius insertion is transferred and fixed to the humerus with two 4.5-mm screws.	1.1081790283994217
Finally the deltoid is sutured on the top of the trapezius and the skin is closed over two suction drains.	1.0039695906542523
Postoperatively we immobilize the operated arm in an abduction support for 6 weeks.	0.8098766571990258
The physiotherapy program starts on the first postoperative day with active training of elbow, hand and fingers and electrostimulation of the transferred trapezius muscle.	0.8971920013033475
Six weeks after the procedure we take an X-ray and start with progressive adduction of the arm.	1.094734321229598
The preoperative subluxation of the humeral head was abolished in all cases.	0.9042012087561576
We achieved an average increase of active abduction from 7.3  ° (range 0-45  °) preoperatively to 39.2  ° (range 25  °-80  °) 1 year after the operation; the increase of forward flexion was from 20  ° (range 0  °-85  °) to 43  ° (range 20  °-90  °).	1.2881274412262242
All patients were satisfied with the improvement of stability and function of the operated shoulder.	0.9972714002065871
Finally we can conclude that the trapezius transfer for flail shoulder gives a satisfactory outcome regarding shoulder function and stability as well as the subjective situation of the patients.	1.1494971825833677
We analyzed psychiatric and criminological data from 103 arsonists.	0.6824889962992577
The following criticisms of the definition of pyromania according to DSM-III-R and IDC-10 seem appropriate.	0.8174372850684978
First, the categoric exclusion of aggressive motives does not seem very promising, since approximately one fourth of arsonists whose firesetting is based on motives quoted in DSM-III-R may also have an aggressive motive.	1.0227167279314027
Second, ICD-10 gives being drunk and alcoholism as a criterion for the exclusion of pyromania.	0.796200657608598
This seems untenable, since the behavior classed as pyromania is largely a product of alcohol misuse.	0.9256037153231536
Repeated firesetting, resulting from being fascinated by fire etc., may be less a disturbance of impulse control but rather the manifestation of a psychoinfantilism, which, supported by alcohol abuse, extends into older age.	1.137239075571
The mean age of such arsonists is slightly above 20 years.	0.925822584363701
The tendency for relapses after imprisonment seems to be low; this tendency probably decreases spontaneously in older age.	0.9426808714803512
The mean age of arsonists with aggressive motives is a little below 30 years, those setting fire with suicidal motives have a mean age of 35, deluded arsonists have a mean age of 40 years.	1.0578508571982241
Concrete sexual motives are relatively rare.	0.5804796536925141
Approximately 50 % of arsonists have a purely aggressive motive.	0.9999770042931697
Retaliation is a rare cause, however, since most of them do not even know the victims.	1.3475967325513007
One third of these persons set the fire in their own homes.	0.9378473284839371
Most arsonists show a personality disorder, with insecurity and narcissism predominating.	0.9595369934445578
Data on firesetting are to be treated with caution, since two thirds of all cases are newer resolved; one fourth of cases concern minors, and in Central Europe arsonists with rational motives are hardly ever referred to psychiatrists.	1.1736833331029062
A normal ciliary beat frequency of ciliated cells is necessary for the mucociliary clearance of the nose and paranasal sinuses.	0.8640341330432523
An in vitro investigation was performed to eval-uate the influence of topical corticosteroids and antihistamines on the ciliary beat frequency of human nasal mucosa.	1.02650127154603
The nasal sprays examined contained the corticosteroids budesonide or fluticasone propionate and the topical antihistamines azelastine or levocabastine.	0.7290091954561381
All tests were performed on cell cultures of human nasal mucosa during constant conditions.	0.8945663982493173
Three of the four nasal sprays tested contained benzalkonium chloride as preservative.	0.8446215754804448
An irreversible cessation of ciliary movement was observed in all cells exposed to nasal sprays containing benzalkonium chloride in a 50 per cent solution.	0.9198521470457272
The nasal spray containing budesonide was benzalkonium chloride-free and caused minor but fully reversible decreases in ciliary beat frequency after 20 min.	0.8314126509941306
As benzalkonium chloride can cause complete standstill of ciliary beat frequency in vitro in human nasal mucosa, we recommend that this preservative should not be used anymore in topical nasal medications.	1.0361131535921573
The treatment of patients with severe burn injuries is expensive and belongs in the hands of specialized burn centres.	1.0362800611709693
In our burn centre 257 patients were treated from 1991 to June 1995 (between 50 and 60 patients per year except for 1993 with 77 patients).	0.9214127016191812
Patients were evaluated according to the ABSI score (mean 7) and had mortality of around 15%.	1.1702164753474553
The costs range between 3.7 and 4.8 million DM per year, the profit lies in the same range.	1.228904779662482
The costs are divided into staff costs (1.4 - 1.8 million DM per year), costs for medical treatment (1.5 - 1.9 million DM per year) and costs for internal services (600 000 - 900 000 DM per year) such as laboratory examinations (247 000 - 386 000 DM per year) and blood bank (100 000 - 215 000 DM per year), the main factors in this category.	1.2458274483116036
The different fields of costs and profit are compared in this analysis.	0.8708135830406151
Possible ways of reducing costs are pointed out, and the question of effectiveness of therapy is discussed.	1.2557559301411507
Conclusions from this analysis are limited by the individuality of each case with different clinical courses, the great number of influencing factors and the comparably small numbers of patients.	1.042222853093649
In benign laryngotracheal stenosis the amount of respiratory deterioration rather than the crude morphologic appearance will determine whether or not surgical measures such as dilatation or resection should be applied.	0.8374340461150976
This review focusses on currently available and newly developed diagnostic tools to assess the functional importance of central airway obstruction.	0.9085996560970822
After an outline of upper airway physiology is formulated, spirometric measurements at rest are collected.	0.7927396256736741
Among these, Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEF) proved to be the simplest and most reliable parameter to monitor an obstructing lesion of the upper airways.	1.117188098186269
A novel technique for fibrobronchoscopic assessment of glottic and tracheal resistance is presented in detail.	0.8859442700562421
In contrast to usual tests of total airflow resistance which cannot distinguish between central and peripheral contributions, this test identifies the pressure-flow-relationship created exclusively by the local lesion.	1.0749004302940004
In serial stenoses, it indicates which is of higher clinical impact.	1.1130911785558386
Patients with upper airway obstruction complain of impaired exercise capacity.	0.7505083868730477
They tend to hypoventilate with imminent respiratory muscle fatigue.	0.5958328424051279
Therefore, spiroergometry may play a role in defining the point of incomplete compensation of a central load.	1.1473155256512952
The decision to operate will depend upon up the degree of physical capacity required to compensate for the stenosis.	0.9989029370373494
Stroke units are hospital-based special wards aiming at optimal care by a specialized team with an integrated concept for patients with acute strokes.	1.0335451197634355
Following the initial neurolo-gical and neuroradiological evaluation, early treatment will be initiated based on the assumed pathophysiology of the stroke.	0.9934919079841664
Acute management includes monitoring of physiological, parameters, care by specialized nurses, and early implementation of physiotherapists, speech therapy and occupational therapy.	1.0066749866402789
Despite the increased initial costs, the long-term burden for the health system is decreased by shorter hospital stay and reduced morbidity and disability.	1.0521165978553995
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is the most important side-effect of heparin therapy.	1.0630440686593343
Two types of thrombocytopenia can be caused by heparin: a frequent non-immunologic type causing a minor decrease in thrombocyte count without apparent clinical importance and, on the other hand, an immunologic type accompanied by thromboembolic complications.	0.9798688558991184
Patients and methods: We report on two cases with HIT type II after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).	0.9885347853571438
HIT antibodies were demonstrated by ELISA for platelet-factor-4-heparin-complex and heparin-induced platelet-activation (HIPA) assay.	1.0366187569814944
Results: A 67 year old patient suffered from a HIT type II seven days after administration of heparin during myocardial revascularization.	1.0393271965840711
In this patient, a continuous fever and a signicantly reduced general condition were the primary symptoms.	1.2000523225854085
The clinical picture of this disease was reversible after aborting the heparin therapy.	1.0574610547567527
Thromboembolic complications did not occur.	0.19890341919125198
A 70 year old patient developed a HIT type II with thromboembolic complications 13 days after CABG.	1.0009631229091565
The vascular occlusions affected the A. spinalis anterior with the development of a spinalis anterior-syndrome, the coronary arteries with the development of myocadial infarction, and the A. iliaca interna.	1.1927215241486464
A white-clot syndrome with thrombi in the ascending aorta, in the left atrium, and in the left ventricle required an operation with extracorporal circulation including the use of recombinant hirudin for anticoagulation.	1.2088499040966536
Conclusion: With therapy with heparin, it is obligatory to check platelet count.	1.275068658804778
An indication for the development of HIT type II is a decrease in platelet count or thromboembolic complications during heparin therapy.	0.8865341766140951
In the case of HIT type II recombinant hirudin was a practical altenative as an anticoagulant for extracorporal circulation and for continous hemofiltration.	0.9148253409417734
Oxygen radicals and oxygen radial mediators are thought to be important components in the development of acute lung injury, sepsis, and multiple organ failure.	0.9831885546988205
Injured patients, patients with pulmonary diseases, and multiple trauma patients also showed an elevated lipid peroxidation, indicating increased oxidant stress.	1.262657306358513
N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) has been used as an antioxidant in a wide variety of experiments.	1.089013771351239
NAC has been suggested to act by raising concentrations of cysteine, and hence glutathione, and by scavenging of oxidant species [1, 11, 17, 29].	1.2226743214456053
The present study was designed to investigate whether the application of NAC in intubated patients has an effect on concentrations of reduced glutathione in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) and on the lipid peroxidation products malondialdehyde and conjugated dienes.	0.9697239752323449
Because NAC has been widely used as a mucolytic drug for the treatment of lung diseases, the influence on tracheobronchial mucus was studied, too.	1.1164809020673063
Between 1990 and 1995, 27 patients with posttraumatic disorders of the subtalar joint were treated by correcting fusion.	1.1028483958631807
Preoperatively 24 patients (88.89 %) suffered from pain; 15 (55.56 %) had a walking range below 100 m. Seven patients were unable to work in their original profession.	1.1542368876417703
After an average period of 13.85 months postoperatively the patients were examined again.	1.2367295228689068
At this time 18 (66.67 %) had no or minimal pain; 19 (70.37 %) had no claudication.	1.2706010183659273
According to the score of Angus and Skuginna, in 81.48 % of patients the result of the correcting arthrodesis was successful; according to Kitaoka's clinical rating system for ankle-hindfoot, midfoot, hallux and lesser toes, the average postoperative score was 75.8 points.	1.2427108061623664
Objective: To examine changes in Body Mass Index (BMI) in children in the last twenty years and to determine the prevalence of overweight and obesity.	1.2011399173853587
The review of medication has been recommended as an important part in preventing falls.	1.1791139996867044
In a random sample of 276 hospital in-patients aged 75 and over, the frequency of prescribed drugs which may increase the risk of falling by causing dizziness was assessed.	0.947270832670939
Questions about dizziness and previous falls were included in a standardized questionnaire.	0.926267974303679
Migration of an impacted mandibular premolar is a rare finding, whereas dystopia of lower jaw cuspids is described much more often in the literature.	1.1075668576560274
We present a patient in whom radiographic studies show the migration of a mandibular premolar to the muscular process over a period of 14 years.	0.9822113182966776
Most of the tooth migration along the vertical portion of the mandibula into the processus muscularis took place after the root development had ended.	0.8506023075228089
Neither radiological nor clinical examination revealed the stimulus which changed the path and the direction of the impacted tooth.	0.8778647510217784
In atopic eczema patients the well-known abnormal cutaneous reactivity of the blood vessels (white dermographism, delayed blanch after acetylcholine, paradoxical blanching after nicotinic acid application and diminished erythema after histamine injection) were observed during acute eczematous episodes and later in an eczema-free state in comparison with controls.	1.0806218199319615
In this follow-up study the use of different stimuli allowed us to demonstrate abnormal cutaneous vascular reactions in the patients depending on the severity of their atopic eczema.	1.1684932012274245
Severely affected patients showed persistence of the paradoxical vascular reactions even in an eczema-free cutaneous state.	0.8313873028428048
We report on a 9-year-old girl with a giant cell fibroblastoma of the right anterior chest wall.	1.136708944241744
This rare soft tissue tumour occurs predominantly in the first two decades of life.	1.1203516298639191
The typical clinical presentation is a solitary, usually 2-6 cm large, non-tender mass of blue-greyish colour which is mostly located on the back, anterior chest wall, thigh or groin.	1.1284946555474937
The histology shows a loose infiltrate of predominantly bland spindle cells in dermis and subcutis.	0.8116239550343219
Characteristic elements of the tumour are large angiectoid branching spaces lacking any endo- or epithelium, and relatively small multinucleated cells (floret cells).	1.0009452743029492
The recurrence rate is high if the tumour is not excised with adequate safety margins.	0.9393758509235434
It is of pre-eminent importance to differentiate this rare benign tumor from sarcomas, in order to avoid an inappropriately aggressive therapy.	1.1093341717141671
To correct severe septal deformities, it is often necessary to perform an extracorporal septoplasty with temporary removal of the deviated septal cartilage, followed by straightening and reimplantation into the nose as free graft.	1.0765020526605962
The utilization of a compound graft, which sutures the cartilage fragments to a resorbable polydioxanon (PDS) foil, facilitates this technique immediately while simultaneously ensuring support of the nasal dorsum.	0.9659548724080396
Stress incontinence is the most frequent form of incontinence found in females.	0.979535804968314
The usual method of surgery for this is to lift the bladder neck towards cranial and ventral.	0.9910011578264974
Two competitive techniques - bladder neck suspension in accordance with Stamey and colposuspension in accordance with Burch - were retrospectively investigated.	1.1237641933734308
A total of 95 women underwent surgery and it was possible to evaluate the postoperative course in 46 and 30 (total 76) patients respectively.	1.3415980040819653
Initially, both surgical techniques demonstrated a very good success rate (91.3 % and 96.7 % resp.).	1.2629656358491224
However, the continence rate of the Stamey patients deteriorated after 6 weeks down to 78.3 % and after more than 2 years only 28.6 % of these patients were still completely continent (mean follow-up 40.4 mths), whereas deterioration in the Burch patients was only 87 % (mean follow-up 44.25 mths).	1.3555904100025022
The disappointing results with the Stamey technique did not correlate with the degree of initial continence.	0.8737404530242276
It was noted here that obese patients showed a greater tendency towards regression.	0.951782790442347
The three cases of recurring incontinence after Burch colposuspension were already relapses at the time of surgery.	0.9710366289621146
With respect to long-term follow-up, our results with the Stamey method were distinctly poorer than with the Burch technique.	1.0196769232460705
Therefore, in our opinion, the Burch colposuspension procedure and fascioplasty should be the method of choice for the management of stress incontinence.	1.206496530338957
This paper is concerned with the relationship between social inequality and psychiatric disorders, an issue being neglected in German psychiatry for a long time.	0.9725025028696037
Social inequality will be discussed in it's dimensions "socioeconomic status" and "sex" referring to the present state of epidemiological and sociological knowledge.	1.0218620260080744
Because such macrosocial factors offer little explanation for the association with psychiatric disorders by themselves microsocial concepts of burden and resources are necessary to link the structural and the individual level.	0.9499577398165386
These concepts are considered to be one pathway by which the mechanisms to disease may occur.	1.0222481064103146
A short review of empirical findings and analytic approaches show the complexity of these mechanisms requiering further research not only because of analytic deficiences but also because of social change.	0.9306096409477296
Further research will concern in general the explanation of social patterns of diseases, in detail the link between individual stress and coping with the social structure, and last but not least a gender-sensitive approach to psychiatric disorders which is more differenciated.	1.0897463585140816
It is well known that alterations to the oral cavity caused by dental prostheses may affect speech articulation, although influences on the voice are not assumed.	1.0254709254144312
In addition to the vocal fundamental frequency, vibrations of the vocal chords generate overtones.	0.9494513907441477
Through the shape of the larynx and the upper airway, resonances and antiresonances are formed, and in this way overtones are amplified to a variable extent.	1.1371868686903939
Nozzle changes caused by a dental prosthesis in the oral cavity may possibly influence overtones but influences on the vocal fundamental frequency seem unlikely.	0.8937033009102793
The influence of dental prostheses on the voice is demonstrated in a patient who owned two different dental prostheses.	1.139980959524346
The fundamental frequency rose by up to five semitones during speech and his vocal range increased by up to four semitones when a thin denture was used instead of a normal denture.	0.9182158217208618
When the position of the mandible was checked by intraoral needle point placement, a more rostral position of the mandible was recorded with the thin denture than with the normal denture.	1.1082502086928518
Sagittal magnetic resonance tomography imaging also showed that the larynx was in a more cranial position.	1.0090237471008117
This change was presumed to be due to an upward movement of the larynx induced by the tongue, which itself was found to be in a more cranial position with the thin denture.	1.1334859694394026
In this situation, increased tension of the laryngeal muscles were believed to induce a rise in fundamental frequency, shifting the voice range toward higher frequencies.	0.9890611628080987
These findings show that dental prostheses can cause vocal changes in individual cases.	0.7878293484510619
The etiology of this occurrence is still not clear.	0.9533586090177264
Its consequences, however, should be known to the dentist, ENT surgeon and phoniatrist if patients notice changes in their voice after having altered or replaced their dentures.	0.9896190489259932
Cytokine blood levels are found to be moderately elevated in chronic heart failure, as a function of severity of disease.	1.1549272421582057
The source of these cytokines and the trigger mechanisms stimulating cytokine release are a matter of intense research.	0.8379470168497981
Potential players include bacterial endotoxin from intestinal translocation, a neurohumoral dysbalance with an enhanced sympathetic tone or an overspill of cytoines from the failing heart itself.	0.8527862251859792
We present arguments in favor of a direct link between the chronically enhanced sympathetic tone in heart failure and the clinically over activation of the immune system, particularly interleukin 6 release.	1.056820219236424
Objectives: This 1998 survey was carried out on the use of the sitting position for neurosurgical procedures in the posterior fossa and operations of the craniospinal and cervical spine region by the dorsal approach.	1.065323490053911
In addition, anesthetic management of the sitting position and the compliance with recommendations of the Neuroanesthesia Study Group of the German Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (DGAI) published in 1995 were investigated and compared to results of a 1995 survey.	1.2105339990699717
Polar body analysis is a perfect tool to exclude genetically altered oocytes prior to fertilisation.	0.8283676612308726
This helps to improve pregnancy rates and baby take home rates in assisted reproduction, primarily in advanced maternal age patients.	0.8853748127403221
This might reduce the need of invasive prenatal diagnosis for those patients.	0.9575284738766132
Polar body analysis offers treatment in reproductive medicine for female patients carrying a chromosomal aberration or a mutation before they become pregnant.	0.8651963509904704
However, it does not assess the genetic status of the embryo resulting from the oocyte tested and selected.	1.1381441958414091
The paternal contribution to the embryo is left unattended.	0.73729679933761
Ethical considerations do not play a role, since no manipulation or selection is performed on embryos.	1.0143971511954974
Pachydermoperiostosis (Friedreich-Erb-Arnold syndrome, Touraine-Solente-Golé syndrome) is a rare disease with an autosomal dominant mode of unheritance; it occurs almost exclusively in men.	1.001636352915841
A report of typical pachydermoperiostosis in a 31-year-old man is presented.	0.993917841464465
Associated features were clubbed digits of the hands and feet with watch-crystal nails, thickening of the skin and soft tissues, hyperhidrosis of hands and feet, hyperplasia of the sebaceous glands with seborrhoea, gynaecomastia, and ophthalmic abnormalities that had been present since puberty.	0.888840958689635
Radiological examination revealed periosteal hyperostosis of the short and long bones.	0.9555605910011188
Endocrine disturbances were not detected.	0.5864582723125311
Skin biopsies showed hypertrophy of the skin and skin appendages.	1.0377122174108453
Primary (idiopathic, hereditary) pachydermoperiostosis should be distinguished from secondary (symptomatic) forms of the disease, which are often associated with lung tumours.	1.0291154887861504
The following review will examine the outcome of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy treatment studies of anorexia and bulimia nervosa.	0.9675885710430382
For both eating disorders, psychotherapy is the treatment of choice.	0.795184084888466
In clinical practice "treatment packages" are offered to account for the complexity of the disorders.	0.9705009119065459
In bulimia nervosa, cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques have dominated the literature and appear to be successful.	0.9081847413973707
Newer studies reporting on the use of interpersonal therapy also find considerable improvement of symptoms.	0.6955816002315792
Antidepressive medication can be useful in the treatment of bulimia nervosa.	0.9143197684896976
Recently, a stepped care approach to treatment has been recommended, with self-care manuals as the first step.	1.2904224222602325
In anorexia nervosa there is a paucity of controlled clinical trials.	0.7748408120719481
Contingency management for weight restoration can be viewed as a necessary element in all in- and outpatient treatments.	1.0528878028471287
Family therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and psychodynamic approaches have proven useful in clinical practice; however, only a limited data base exists regarding the efficacy of these therapies.	1.1565173611268214
Medication should not be used routinely in the treatment of anorexia nervosa.	1.0122703964792534
Absorption of irrigating fluid in transurethral prostatic resection (TURP) and percutaneous nephrolitholapaxy (PNL) into veins or delayed absorption due to fluid extravasation may result in a TURP syndrome.	0.9262253093495524
The measurement of end-tidal breath alcohol concentration (et AC) as a monitor of absorption of irrigating fluid labelled with 2% ethanol is limited by the disturbance of infrared sensors by volatile anaesthetics and nitrous oxide (N2O) (Fig.	1.0312211691438988
An electrochemical sensor is acceptable for this method.	0.8040805450104026
The aim of the present study was the evaluation of breath alcohol measurements using an electrochemical sensor device (Alcomed 3010, Envitec).	0.9615341768277832
The stability of the sensor in the presence of volatile anaesthetics was examined using a lung model.	0.7843560638407249
In a clinical investigation, the device was then applied to spontaneously breathing or mechanically ventilated patients inhaling volatile anaesthetics during endoscopic urological surgery.	0.9741054027310969
Skin diseases, the psyche and psychological changes are often intertwined, especially in patients presenting for expert dermatologic opinion.	1.1672482756426883
In many cases an additional evaluation provided by psychotherapeutic medicine may be necessary.	0.945264848158965
This resource may help with the diagnosis, explanation of the problem and estimation of the degree of disability.	1.0533304804984043
The different legal guidelines of the various evaluation boards must be considered.	0.8939445117099935
The role of psychotherapeutic evaluation is demonstrated through case examples.	0.7472662833108152
The evaluation of new possibly occupationally-related disorders such as multiple chemical sensitivity and mobbing is considered.	0.8874207264784284
We investigated the impact of old age on the antidepressant effect of sleep deprivation.	0.7593696212776628
32 depressive inpatients were assessed before and after sleep deprivation by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.	0.8345592444004717
The patients were divided into two groups according to their age.	0.8721642021226006
The result showed no negative impact of old age on the anti-depressant effect of sleep deprivation.	0.7327308963455618
During MRI-controlled resection of brain tumors using an open MRI system, operation-induced alterations may occur, especially enhancement of the resection cavity wall.	1.1678430886319626
This may simulate tumor areas, resulting in false assessment of the resection or resection of non-tumorous areas.	0.9785076719893765
Based on 42 MRI- and biopsy-controlled brain tumor resections in an 0.5 T open MRI (Signa SP, GE), the appearance and origin of operation-induced reactions are analyzed.	1.1165906021244114
In our opinion, there is a superposition of preformed peritumoral reactions by operation-induced microcontusions.	0.8463645874408245
The beginning of the cavity wall enhancement needs at least 10-15 min.	0.9840653797183019
MRI-controlled analysis of the intraoperative steps by the neurosurgeon and neuroradiologist allows discrimination of operation-induced reactions from tumor areas and leads to safe operation.	0.921860115681265
Angiosarcomas are very rare but highly malignant soft tissue tumors derived from the vascular endothelium.	0.9966446220539198
The tumor is most commonly found in the skin.	1.1457693710804722
The cancer is known to cause early and widespread metastases leading to a very poor prognosis of less than 24 months.	1.0375700058250386
The therapy of choice is radical surgery followed by adjuvant radiation.	0.8763283383084666
Background: Lipoprotein (a) is an important codominantly inherited risk factor for coronary disease but there is little data about its distribution in childhood.	1.2153739572513191
Despite the important role of lymph node infiltration for the classification and prognosis of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), no standards exist to evaluate the quality of mediastinal lymphadenectomy.	1.1765306377480864
Researches at several centers are not convinced that complete ipsilateral lymphadenectomy is necessary.	0.7556245757622299
We investigated 270 consecutive patients undergoing a potential curative operation for NSCLC including complete ipsilateral lymph node dissection in order to ascertain whether or not there is a correlation between tumor localization and lymph node infiltration.	1.0681179764996536
Patients were classified into the UICC (1987) stages I (n = 115), II (n = 42), and IIIa (n = 113).	1.347283407819756
In patients with N1-positive lymph nodes (n = 61) we found higher 5-year survival for patients with only intrapulmonary lymph node infiltration (39 %) than for patients with hilar infiltration (21 %).	1.1923192158223503
Patients with N2 disease showed skip metastases in up to 81 % of cases.	0.8957217402137391
We found that no tumor location predicted the lymph node infiltration.	0.9033622245647422
Due to the variability of lymph node infiltration and the frequently occurring skip metastases, complete ipsilateral lymphadenectomy should be the standard for curative operations for NSCLC.	1.0562188187044876
The muscles should be viewed as a response member in functional and structural disorders as well as in central control.	1.0920216573111234
This second part of the article will attempt to show not only that the muscles are representing an interesting and sensitive information pool for disorders in the motoric system, but also that lesions in specific leg and hip muscles have an effect on the pelvis and spine and even on scapular mobility.	1.0815305669055544
Purpose: The aim of the study was to apply laparoscopic techniques in reconstructive procedures for aortoiliac occlusive disease.	0.9965870000029587
Methods: From February 1996 to February 1998, 16 patients underwent a laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass procedure (ABF) using the transperitoneal approach.	1.1834183679573114
Six, 5 to 12 mm ports were needed to dissect, cross-clamp and divide the infrarenal aorta using specific laparoscopic devices.	0.9648734007644036
The aortic anastomosis was made end-to-side.	0.9477712530584615
A long curved clamp was then passed from each groin to draw the limbs of the graft into the femoral incision.	0.9639089940763825
The distal anastomosis was then performed conventionally.	0.7103227430475358
Results: The laparoscopic ABF was performed successfully in 13 of 16 cases.	1.1530360523599816
Three times a conversion to open surgery was requested.	0.8919682965911946
One patient developed respiratory insufficiency requiring prolonged treatment on the ICU.	0.9353623905170313
Mean operative time was 292 +/- 60 min; the aorta was crossclamped for 74 +/- 18 min.	1.0039672242558382
Two patients needed transfusions of red blood cells.	0.7994568071586646
In the study group, blood loss averaged 566 +/- 434 ml.	0.954587233030425
The bypass patency and the correct positioning of the graft were assessed by angiography.	0.9940266811024048
The patients were discharged 9 +/- 5.8 days after surgery.	1.026799955313267
At follow-up after 4.5 +/- 4 months, 15 patients were examined noninvasively in the vascular laboratory.	1.2727134079664408
All grafts were patent, and the ischemic symptoms had resolved in 14 patients.	1.152842691626597
One patient with recurrent claudication had severe stenosis of the left distal anastomosis.	1.1222178177469209
Conclusions: The laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass is a feasible, safe and effective procedure.	0.9843058074702116
Specific laparoscopic instruments are required for the challenging procedure.	0.7900418317790996
The development of vascular staplers and retraction devices will probably reduce the operative time and the technical challenge.	0.9652020346523746
In the future this operative technique may gain relevance as a minimally invasive procedure for severe aortoiliac occlusive disease.	1.0075531403065667
A 12 year old boy developed the complete symptom complex of Adamantiades-Behçet's disease over a two-year period.	1.0059322573347995
He presented with the mucocutaneous variant with recurrent to persistent oral ulcers which extended into the pharynx, recurrent genital ulcers, perianal lesions, and a positive pathergy test.	1.1099212189435959
Ocular involvement and other  symptoms associated with the disease were absent.	1.104024299125774
However, the early onset of the  disease and the male gender indicated a bad prognosis.	1.3402795848075393
The patients father deficiency of suffered from bronchial asthma with recurrent respiratory infections.	0.747045724451147
An IgG-3 subclass was detected.	0.6172447329452022
Lymphocyte transformation tests showed markedly diminished response to stimulation with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody in both patients, while response to PWM, CoA and PHA was normal.	0.8731996152367288
In addition, the concentration of serum soluble interleukin 6 receptor was reduced in both patients.	0.9678533757225607
A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the detection of dermatophytes was established.	0.6903931635835033
The primers "TR1" and "TR2" amplify a 581 bp fragment within the gene coding for the small ribosomal subunit (18S rRNA) of fungi.	1.000373558128081
PCR allowed the detection of isolates of 7 common dermatophytes and in addition several yeasts and moulds.	0.8776271680975924
Hybridisation with specific oligonucleotides results in the identification of dermatophytes and Candida albicans.	0.8223516512366406
Restriction analysis of the PCR product allowed us to distinguish between dermatophytes and yeasts or moulds.	0.8751698695544414
The specifity of the PCR with respect to fungi was assessed by testing human DNA collected from 42 dermis and epidermis specimens as well as DNA from selected plants and animals.	0.9319070967762789
To evaluate the clinical relevance of the PCR assay, 69 routinely collected skin and nail specimens were examined by PCR and culture.	1.0842013613290646
PCR detected dermatophytes in 35 and culture in 28 of 38 specimens that were classified as positive.	0.8931970715431253
Sensitivity of PCR (92%) was higher than that of culture (73%).	0.9479863722870956
These results show that PCR has advantages over culture for the detection of dermatophytes.	0.7618662084453706
Starting with the recommendations of the "Psychiatrie-Enquête", a current empirical stock-taking was undertaken about the structure of care in psychiatric hospital units.	0.966960985206434
319 treatment units (289 in Germany, 11 in Austria, and 19 in Switzerland) were investigated concerning size of the treatment unit, number of wards, centrality of admission, existence of large observation rooms ("Wachsäle"), spezialized wards, single sex wards, regionalization/sectorization, open-door wards, coercive measures, and intended structural changes.	1.1418465611968174
The return rate of questionnaires amounted 59%.	0.6414791764020374
The results show that the recommendations of the "Psychiatrie-Enquête" are mostly realized today, but not everywhere.	1.058414626833838
Across countries differences resulted in size of ward, centrality of admission, open-door wards, and coercive measures.	0.7541825001347626
Treatment units in the western and eastern parts of germany differed in size of ward and centrality of admission.	0.8532204524440488
Differences between psychiatric hospitals, psychiatric departments at general hospitals and psychiatric university hospitals were, though significant, smaller than expected in the light of past controversies.	1.0262437354891787
Intended structural changes mainly concerned open-door wards, internal sectorization, decentralization of admission, and mixing the sexes in single sex wards.	0.8356662125950518
Background: The ciliary sulcus as the intended location of transsclerally fixated posterior chamber lenses (PCL) is withdrawn from the surgeon's view.	1.0004555733175182
Using high-resolution ultrasound, we acquire pictures that postoperatively allow us to determine the position of the haptics.	0.9690440338577538
Many patients would like to resume some sport activities after total knee replacement; however, most recommendations are based on subjective opinion rather than scientific evidence.	1.0114698227686878
Background: Considering the high recurrence rate after conventional inguinal hernia repair, the totally preperitoneal endoscopic inguinal hernia repair has been used.	1.1378891297742584
Methods: The present experience of the authors embraces 1085 patients with a total of 1717 inguinal hernias, including 200 recurrences.	1.2207242040831068
The operative technique is described with emphasis on pitfalls and tricks.	0.9473468992718105
Results: Analysis of the data concerning the first 403 patients with 1 year complete follow-up reveals a mean (SEM) operating time of 42 (1.2) min for unilateral and 58 (1.0) min for bilateral hernia repair.	1.341355832287277
Mean (SEM) postoperative hospital stay was 2 (0.04) days.	0.9928145015618958
Complication rates during and after operation were 0.3 % and 3.3 % respectively.	1.2141325715673768
The morbidity rate at 1 month after operation was 3.5 %.	1.0515725031771614
The recurrence rate was 0.3 % at 1-year follow-up.	1.1140145086109097
Conclusion: Totally preperitoneal endoscopic inguinal hernia repair is safe and reproducible for any type of primary or recurrent inguinal hernia, even in patients with previous subumbilical surgery or severe systemic disease.	1.138131248295117
Careful follow-up is mandatory to assess the late recurrence rate.	0.9416403725260094
Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate prospectively whether there are differences in spectrometrically measurable parameters of the fundus between patients with early and late age-related maculopathy (ARM), the children of the ARM patients (F1 generation) and normals.	1.1902102225478715
In approximately 4-10 % of patients presenting with renal cell cancer the transluminal propagation of a tumor thrombus into the vena cava inferior or the right atrium comes to diagnosis.	1.0419149509539711
Recent investigations have indicated that the presence of neoplastic extension into the venous system does not reveal independent prognostic value regarding the clinical course of the disease.	0.9458484062787086
Although the complete surgical removal of vena cava thrombosis in patients without simultaneously occurring regional lymph node or distant metastases has become a well established treatment modality, several questions concerning this surgical strategy still remain the subject of ongoing discussions.	1.0974076033126636
In the present investigation that included 92 patients with renal cell cancer and intracaval neoplastic extension it was clearly demonstrated that the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest preferably during the removal of intracaval thrombosis extending into the right atrium does not result in a substantially increased treatment-related intra- or postoperative mortality.	1.1480497509421477
However, in contrast to a previously reported observation this treatment option did not reveal any substantial impact on the long-term survival of the patients following surgical therapy.	1.399514719477881
Accordingly, the cranial extension of intracaval thrombosis was not identified as a biological variable of any prognostic importance for renal cell cancer patients.	1.0660173720921569
Vascular surgery or penile prosthesis implantation are the main surgical options for erectile dysfunction.	0.8867036512149576
In this category, penile revascularization is the only causal therapy for selected patients: males younger than 50 years of age at time of surgery, maximum of two risk factors, exclusion of diabetes mellitus.	1.0408060658193452
Long-term success decreased to 53 % to 55 % in comparison to first encouraging reports of 80 % success.	1.465489506817886
Venous surgery resulted in an even more distinct decline of success the longer the elapse of time after surgery.	0.9120047279653422
Long-term success dropped under 40 %, leaving only a few indications for penile venous ligation.	1.3017375972133391
In contrast, penile prosthesis implantation results in high satisfaction rates.	0.9722390099703417
Despite this, it is not generally recommended as first choice surgical management as it is linked to irreversible damage of the cavernosal bodies.	1.0632714874319797
Among numerous types of penile implants, preference is nowadays mostly given to the three-piece hydraulic models.	0.8961853088051269
However, such complications as defective or perforated cylinders in up to 35 % after 5 years have arisen, depending on the type of implant.	1.3338525208868504
In a selected patient group, vacuum constriction devices with a mean patient acceptance of 75 % (50 % to 90 %) seldom result in complications and are thus considered to be a well-established therapeutical option.	1.229877273285605
It has been suggested that anhedonia, the loss of pleasure, is associated with a dysfunction of the dopaminergic reward system in schizophrenic and alcohol-dependent patients.	0.9448890727196411
In a series of neuroendocrinological and brain imaging studies, we examined pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms of dopaminergic neurotransmission in non-human primates and in schizophrenic and alcohol-dependent patients.	0.8773315455814186
Among alcoholics, we found indicators of a sensitization of dopaminergic neurotransmission, which was associated with the relapse risk, but not with anhedonia or depression.	1.274533649703211
Schizophrenics with neuroleptic blockade of striatal dopamine D2 receptors displayed psychomotor slowing and reduced motivation, but not anhedonia.	0.9801174102862689
Primate studies pointed to the importance of a temporo-cortical dysfunction in the pathogenesis of phasic dopaminergic dysregulation in the striatum.	0.8636735414343346
These observations indicate that a dysfunction of stimulus-dependent dopamine release may be associated with motivational deficits caused by a reduction in incentive salience, but not with anhedonia.	1.0236835743296553
Any operation for lung cancer that is planned as curative includes dissection of the lymph nodes in the mediastinum in order to allow correct staging of the disease.	0.9983066394173399
It is well known that ipsilateral lymph node metastases (N2) mean a poor prognosis.	0.7910153241418997
Since most patients with this finding die from metastatic tumor progression within 3 years after the operation, it can be assumed that positive findings in the mediastinal lymph nodes represent generalization of the cancer.	1.1081593718786926
Therefore, the probability of a therapeutic effect from more radical removal of lymph nodes in the mediastinum is rather low.	1.0520201174401727
On the other hand, it is justified to apply and evaluate additional systemic treatment in these tumor stages.	1.07336577109505
In analogy with high-dose contrast-enhanced CT, there have been a few studies during recent years that have dealt with high-dose paramagnetic contrast dyes in MRI.	1.2115810647369436
One reason for these studies was the development of new and low-osmolar contrast agents in the MR field.	1.207946546389282
Depending on the clinical problem, a high-dose contrast study in MRI is rarely indicated: (1) in metastatic disease, MR imaging with high-dose contrast material is indicated when the standard dose study is negative or only shows a solitary cerebral lesion or a number of lesions just suitable for radiosurgery; (2) in patients with malignant glioma the high-dose study allows better definition of the tumor margins.	1.3180598196027544
If a radical surgical approach is planned, the diagnostic potential should be fully used; if only a biopsy or subtotal debulking is planned, a standard dose study is enough.	1.1364707416760416
(3) in patients with MS, a high-dose study is only recommended within therapeutic trials in which the number of active plaques is a primary variable.	1.2123256850276
The basic idea of the Collaborative Family Health Care is nothing new.	0.793734874864507
It has its roots in the bio-psycho-social model of medicine developed by George Engel in the U.S.A. and it has a long tradition in the German psychosomatic medicine.	1.0975659560693258
At a time of basic changes in our health care system caused by cost considerations owing to the cutting back of resources it is important to note, that Collaborative Family Health Care combines aspects of theoretical models and pragmatic action-orientation.	1.0069109477969815
The basic is a systemic view of illness and health.	0.8055121842474684
The doctor-patient-dyad is in this view enlarged to a treatment-triad composed of the therapist, the patient and his family, to be able to bundle the whole potential at disposal, i.e.	1.0976391232228428
the treatment motivation of the patient, the support of the family and the expertize of the therapist.	1.0686313986464058
A lot of studies support the resource- saving potential of coopertive methods.	0.7672946570493174
However, their realization is not possible without considerable learning processes of physicians, psychotherapists and other  professionals.	1.225342594967899
A potential has to be mobilized, which affects by no means only the costs.	0.9922463553919163
The Collaborative Family Health Care offers new challenges to the professional culture of psychotherapists and new chances for influencing the world of medical health care.	0.9020538548246004
At a time of obviously reduced professional solidarity, the iniitiatives of CFHC offer a possibility for physicians, patients and their relatives to reach contentment through cooperation.	1.0728778721543786
Interested colleagues are invited to collaborate in the German Section of the CFHC.	0.9082410963440992
We evaluated the short- to mid-term results of an unconstrained total ankle prosthesis (S. T. A. R.) with uncemented fixation.	1.257144249040214
Fifty consecutive ankle replacements were performed in 48 patients between 1996 and 1999.	0.8682051734041404
The initial diagnosis was posttraumatic osteoarthrosis in 31 cases (62 %), primary osteoarthrosis in 8 cases (16 %), and systemic joint affection in 11 cases (22 %), e. g. rheumatoid arthritis (6 cases), hemochromatosis (2 cases), psoriasis arthritis (1 case), lupus erythematodes (1 case), and sclerodermia (1 case).	1.2559608955158756
There were two perioperative complications: one superficial wound dehiscence that healed uneventfully, and one injury to the dorsal foot artery that necessitated primary reconstruction.	1.0713668528498852
Seven revisions, all in cases of posttraumatic arthrosis, were necessary: local revision of the fibula for painful lateral impingement (3 cases), posteromedial soft tissue revision for painful restriction of dorsiflexion (2 cases), percutaneous lengthening of the Achilles tendon (1 case), and osteotomy and callus distraction for angular correction after stress fracture of the distal tibia (1 case).	1.2407595083784393
At the last follow-up control, 21 patients (62 %) were very satisfied, 10 patients (29 %) were satisfied, and 3 patients (9 %) were satisfied with reservations.	1.4520960687426632
The obtained range of motion was 30  ° (range, 15 to 55  °), with a maximal plantarflexion of 25  ° (range, 15 to 45  °) and dorsiflexion of 5  ° (-3 to 20  °).	1.3035605665110344
When the AOFAS-Hindfoot-Score was applied, the 34 patients scored 84.1 points (range, 44 to 100 points).	0.9660353291850455
After settling of the implants within 6 weeks, no migration was noted in any case, and all implants were considered to be stable.	1.2754767306771522
The favorable results were considered to be a result of the mechanical properties of the S. T. A. R. total ankle prosthesis that allows for unconstrained motion of the polyethylene inlay on the tibial component, e. g. anteroposterior translation, mediolateral translation and axial rotation.	1.020864668111435
The success of implantation may depend on exact technique, correct hindfoot alignement, sufficient capsuloligamentous stability of the ankle, and a solid bone stock.	1.3129201919647993
Although our first results are very encouraging, a longer follow-up is mandatory to answer the question whether ankle replacement is a viable alternative to ankle arthrodesis.	1.071948384606187
In a prospective study, the influence of the status of the peri-implant hard and soft tissues on the success of enosseous dental implants in tumor patients was assessed.	1.005020904060309
Out of 59 tumor patients with 261 implants, treated between July 1988 and August 1996, a pool of 23 patients with 99 implants provided with dentures for at least 1 year was obtained.	1.0200137887550158
Eighteen of these patients suffered from a squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity.	0.9483252346665527
Seventeen patients underwent preoperative radiation (40 Gy).	0.8963802915165036
A total of 68 out of 99 implants were inserted into autologous bone transplanted to reconstruct the mandible.	0.9042235687149841
In order to assess the peri-implant hard and soft tissues, the Hygiene Index, the Sulcus Bleeding Index, the Gingiva Index, the pocket-probing depth, the peri-implant bone resorption, and the periotest were used.	1.1194890352341602
The results in the tumor patients were compared with the results in a pool of nontumor patients.	1.4653207518270628
Tumor patients had significantly worse peri-implant parameters than nontumor patients.	0.8725833384649787
The peri-implant pocket-probing depth proved to have significant influence on the success rate.	0.9835631174406265
The overall success rate was 77.8%.	0.7262374145092514
Many articles in the literature document the fact that postoperative pain therapy has not improved for decades despite new insights into pain physiology, the availability of powerful analgesics and the development of new techniques.	1.105612944811479
This project was set up to develop practical, effective, safe, and easy to run acute pain therapy.	1.0612933543521423
A 26-year-old man sustained a C2 arc fracture.	0.9304157283967556
Ventral spondylodesis using an H-plate was performed.	0.78357658136733
The patient developed a pharyngovertebral fistula which remained undetected for 1 year.	0.7645010579768564
Spontaneous fusion of C3/C4 and osteolysis of the cortical block occurred.	0.7418150743288645
The fistula was demonstrated intraoperatively and the implant was transorally removed.	1.0138951936604588
No further problems occurred after this unusual method of treatment.	0.8550296680125441
The anatomy of the cervical spine, special problems of intensive care patients and the use of proper instrumentation are discussed.	1.0193109469945758
An interscalene block of the brachial plexus was combined with general anaesthesia for repair of a complex chronic lesion of the shoulder.	1.018843577450278
The localisation of the plexus with electro-stimulation and the injection of Bupivacain 0.5% were accomplished easily and without painful sensations.	1.0900470989038287
48 hours later the block was still partially present.	0.8083818824166563
Paraesthesia and a sensory and motor innervation deficit affected mainly the dorsal fascicle, but also areas innervated by the median and lateral fascicles.	1.044968605353952
The deficit did not completely disappear for 18 month.	0.699025429490719
The cause could have been due to direct traumatisation during blockade or operation, toxic action of the injected substance (Bupivacain 0,5%, 30 ml), distension of the plexus, a cervical syndrome or an aseptic plexitis, although a definite determination is not possible.	1.2639365042296942
However, the pattern of the lesion and the lack of pain during localisation of the plexus and injection favour traumatisation during the acromioplasty.	1.1019148920173039
Microfilm photography allows documentation of naevi in a map-like fashion.	0.7959425736955578
The localization of multiple naevi is no longer a problem, as one can scan the film.	1.0700525554376414
Comparison of the magnified film with the patient can be done in day-light.	1.0586734672960396
Magnification up to 48 times is possible.	0.6810797275019185
Detection of early changes of the naevi, during the horizontal growth phase, should increase the 5-year survival rate.	1.1576513915087978
In the ancient times, Aristotle, Herophilos, and Galen discovered basic anatomical structures.	0.8551329426164953
Paul von Aegina, in the seventh century a. c., had the idea of a nerve suture, which was first performed in an animal 1000 years later by the Italian surgeon Gabriele Ferrara.	1.270134155081342
Systematic investigations on nerve crossing date to the beginning of the nineteenth century and were conducted by Jean Pierre Flourens.	0.899025809813615
Within 1 week in summer 1864, two French surgeons (Laugier and Nélaton) independently carried out the first nerve sutures in humans.	0.9100950788518903
Their observations of an immediate functional recovery of the appropriate muscles after suturing were discussed controversially in scientific circles.	0.9312652737016908
Purpose: To analyze the value of electrophysiologic testing according to standards of the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV) in infants less than 10 years of age.	1.107024909211751
Aggressive angiomyxoma (AAM) is a tumor of the soft tissues predominantely occurring in the genital and pelvic area with a strong propensity to local recurrences.	1.0798006200662906
The entity was first described in 1983.	0.6939513966453885
The tumor is regarded as low-grade sarcoma by some authors; its cause and pathogenesis are presently unknown.	1.0531587033987664
This is a case report on a 27-year-old man who underwent 4 surgical procedures of the left lower extremity because of a recurrent soft tissue neoplasm, initially (August 1993) diagnosed as a myxolipoma.	1.2504983227222815
The patient suffered from recurrences in February 1995, September 1996 and February 1998.	0.7836261488692546
The diagnosis was revised at the time of the latest recurrence.	1.0502210178734053
A palliative resection with macroscopic residuals left was performed in February 1998, followed by a radiation therapy with 56 Gy total dose and a concomitant administration of the radiosensitizer razoxane per os.	0.9999323122037327
The single radiation doses were 200 cGy 5 times a week.	0.6817669813622046
The small residuals of the tumor obviously regressed although an objective response could not be shown because the lesion was not clearly measurable.	1.0931532368763206
A follow-up 2 years after the radiation treatment revealed no recurrence.	0.9820901077515575
The time of the local control achieved as yet is already longer than any former time to regrowth between the surgical procedures.	1.1000446171853435
This is, to our knowledge, the first description of a therapeutic irradiation of a recurrent aggressive angiomyxoma.	1.2185602387980567
Radiation therapy combined with the sensitizer razoxane is able to control a recurrent AAM for an unknown time.	0.8662074713274027
It remains open whether a radiation treatment alone would have had a similar effect.	0.888249385630786
Micronervereconstruction of motor and sensitive nerves in the head and neck area today has an established range of indications.	0.9635827243910529
Surgical procedures of external and internal neurolyses, nerve coaptation and nerve transplantation techniques are well standardized.	0.9228787285762029
With microneurosurgery of motor nerves, satisfying or good results can be generally obtained.	0.8224237210262988
Success rates exceeding 50% following sensitive nerve reconstructions justify the performance of the procedures, more so because of the subjective improvements for the individual patient.	1.0582996782325167
Perspectives can be seen in further simplification of surgical methods of harvesting nerve grafts, e.g., by development of minimally invasive, eventually endoscopically guided procedures.	1.0293476731136524
Allogenic nerve grafts may also be applied.	0.8152073681908949
Initial experiments with nerve distractions are encouraging.	0.6323236493174923
A better understanding of nerve lesions on cellular and molecular biological levels may improve our knowledge of posttraumatic regulatory procedures and may lead to future possibilities of nonsurgical treatment options for peripheral and central nerve lesions by guided regeneration.	0.989831468824994
Objective: The acceptance of fibromyalgia as a disease entity and its definitive diagnosis have been hampered by a dearth of knowledge concerning the underlying pathophysiology of this disease and the lack of specific biochemical markers applicable to its diagnosis.	1.0817842782050182
To determine whether abnormal collagen metabolism is a characteristic of fibromyalgia, we have analyzed collagen metabolites in the urine and serum of patients with fibromyalgia.	1.2240517656744034
Methods: The diagnosis of fibromyalgia was made according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria.	1.001753355926008
Urine and serum were collected under standardized conditions from 39 patients and 55 age- and sex-matched controls.	0.9562137200221744
Pyridinoline (Pyd) and deoxypyridinoline (Dpyd), which represent products of lysyl oxidase-mediated cross-linking in collagen and are indicators of connective tissue and bone degradation, respectively, were analyzed by ion-paired and gradient HPLC method with fluorescence detection (HPLC).	1.0840675851587618
Levels of hydroxypyroline (Hyp), a collagen turnover marker, were also measured.	1.1953818120307216
The findings were related to creatinine levels and the Pyd/Dpyd ratio determined.	0.8212285879673904
The Pyd/Dpyd ratios in the urine and serum and the Hyp in the urine were significantly lower in patients with fibromyalgia than in healthy controls.	1.0141243853280597
Conclusion: Decreased levels of collagen cross-linking may contribute to remodeling of the extracellular matrix and collagen deposition around the nerve fibers in fibromyalgia and contribute to the lower pain threshold at the tender points.	1.040871979118045
Analysis of altered collagen metabolism either by histologic examination on biopsy or, preferably, by HPLC analysis of collagen metabolites in urine or serum may aid to understand more about the pathogenesis of fibromyalgia.	1.021147834417038
Background: The dynamic radionuclide nephrography (Tc99m-MAG3) is an important method in the evaluation of obstruction of the upper urinary tract.	1.1586356261854307
The aim of the present study was to assess whether radionuclid nephrography under standardized conditions with adequate hydration and Furosemid induced diuresis can reliably detect a significant obstruction at the pelvi-ureteric junction.	0.9349297471472102
We therefore tested whether minimal tracer washout (10-25%) in the presence of normal renal function could justity a non-operative managment.	1.1529782006834988
The lateral decubitus position is the standard position for nephrectomies.	0.9632966321733331
There is a lack of data about the effects of this extreme position upon respiratory mechanics and gas exchange.	0.8738842118622401
In 20 patients undergoing surgery in the nephrectomy position, we compared a new closed-loop-controlled ventilation algorithm, adaptive lung ventilation (ALV), which adapts the breathing pattern automatically, to the respiratory mechanics with conventionally controlled mandatory ventilation (CMV).	1.1790256696202492
The aims of our study were (1) to describe positioning effects on respiratory mechanics and gas exchange, (2) to compary ventilatory parameters selected by the ALV controller with traditional settings of CMV, and (3) to assess the individual adaptation of the ventilatory parameters by the ALV controller.	1.1252014766151548
The respirator used was a modified Amadeus ventilator, which is controlled by an external computer and possesses an integrated lung function analyzer.	1.08602501643554
In a first set of measurements, we compared parameters of respiratory mechanics and gas exchange in the horizontal supine position and 20 min after changing to the nephrectomy position.	1.1141788858263502
In a second set of measurements, patients were ventilated with ALV and CMV using a randomized crossover design.	1.0283136828911557
The CMV settings were a tidal volume of 10 ml/kg body weight, a respiratory rate of 10 breaths/min, an I:E ratio of 1:1.5, and an end-inspiratory pause of 30% of inspiratory time.	1.248255182031795
With both ventilation modes FiO2 was set to 0.5 and PEEP to 3 cm H2O.	1.0732655993914841
During ALV a desired alveolar ventilation of 70 ml/kg KG - min was preset.	1.111664382327354
All other ventilatory parameters were determined by the ALV controller according to the instantaneously measured respiratory parameters.	0.9667252181111459
Positioning induced a reduction of compliance from 61.6 to 47.9 ml/cm H2O; the respiratory time constant shortened from 1.2 to 1.08 s, whereas physiological dead space increased from 158.9 to 207.5 ml.	1.239169350530779
On average, the ventilatory parameters selected by the ALV controller resembled very closely those used with CMV.	0.8099151447816659
However, an adaptation to individual respiratory mechanics was clearly evident with ALV.	1.1785930535952334
In conclusion, we found that the effects of positioning for nephrectomy are minor and may give rise to problems only in patients with restrictive lung disease.	1.1675808094657114
The novel ALV controller automatically selects ventilatory parameters that are clinically sound and are better adapted to the respiratory mechanics of ventilated patients than the standardized settings of CMV are.	0.9100423939482157
Noma is an ulcerative-necrotizing gingivo-stomatitis eventually leading to severe destruction of the midface, including lips and cheek, maxilla/mandible, nose and rarely the orbit.	0.9189553923947018
The defects are usually unilateral.	0.6186599049675822
Children from economically underdeveloped countries are predominantly affected.	0.6169882233259517
Medically untreated the disease has a high mortality rate, which can be dramatically lowered by adequate antibiotic therapy started in time.	1.0828587091983646
Predisposing factors include malnourishment, immunosuppression, and poor oral hygiene.	0.951373960243716
Forty-eight noma patients were surgically treated in Sokoto, Nigeria during October 1997 by an Interplast Germany team sponsored by AWD Stiftung Kinderhilfe.	0.8093123544845545
Interdisciplinary surgical strategies and results, e. g. ankylosis release, local flap coverage and 12 pedicled musculocutaneous latissimus dorsi island flaps, as well as a noma classification (NOMAC), are presented.	1.060243284168695
During a period of 3 years, four controled clinical studies in 34 patients with hypercholesterolaemia and 40 healthy persons - in some cases with stratification of the basic cholesterol levels and matched pair formation - were performed to find out the effects of serial sun-like UV irradiation on various serum parameters and blood circulation functions.	1.2490142350597493
The following significant effects were observed.	0.576715233516217
Patients with hypercholesterolaemia: increase of HDL cholesterol after termination of the serial UV irradiation, increase of serum 25 (OH)D3 levels, decrease of serum triiodothyronine, decrease of serum lactate; healthy persons: decrease of resting pulse rate, decrease of recovery pulse rate, decrease of systolic blood pressure.	0.9833199967608502
All effects were induced by application of suberythematous UV doses, i.e.	0.6510675415927457
amounts of UV with a relatively low risk of side effects.	0.8439649312363602
In 1998 Minor et al.	0.5040904156206631
described a new variant of perilymphatic fistula: the "superior canal dehiscence syndrome".	0.8383010329420306
This syndrome is clinically characterized by recurrent attacks of vertigo and oscillopsia induced by loud noises or stimuli that result in changes in intracranial or middle ear pressure.	0.8309326404009738
It is caused by a dehiscence of bone overlying the superior (anterior) semicircular canal.	0.863574142160161
Due to this dehiscence, a third, mobile window (in addition to the round and oval windows) is formed, and changes in pressure are pathologically transduced to the anterior semicircular canal.	1.175247702341724
In the present study we evaluated proprioceptive capabilities of the knee joint with a balance test and correlated these findings to parameters which document mechanical stability.	1.0664734019858224
We compared 8 conservatively treated and 12 surgically treated patients with ACL-deficient knee joints with a control group of 12 subjects.	1.0290929680775334
The balance test was performed with a Kistler force plate.	0.8803839187120324
Both the conservatively treated and the surgically treated patients showed significantly higher deviations of their centre of gravity than the control group.	0.9685254055237048
This was true not only for the injured leg but also for the noninjured contralateral leg.	1.0034941078481898
The differences were most remarkable when comparing the entire distance of centre of gravity deviations during 10 s. Additionally, the conservatively treated patients interrupted the test procedure significantly more frequently than the other two groups.	1.0337321435015885
We were not able to document any correlation between proprioceptive function and parameters for joint stability such as anterior drawer, Lachman, pivot shift and KT-1000 measurements.	0.8096087452469707
The study examined the validity of psychometric measures for the assessment of driving ability in brain-damaged subjects.	0.8773571086670356
116 patients with brain damage mainly of vascular and traumatic origin underwent  extensive neuropsychological examinations emphasizing attentional performance and visual perceptual speed and participated in a comprehensive on-road driving test.	0.9570946858180339
Only 58% of the patients passed the driving test.	0.9812426612235369
Attempts to predict the outcome of the driving test by discriminant analysis or cut-off procedures based on neuropsychological and/or other subject-related data yielded a maximum of 73% correct predictions.	0.973757303087231
In view of the frequent impairment in driving ability after brain damage and in view of the failure to reliably predict driving ability from psychometric test results, it is recommended that in each case an on-road driving test is given.	1.047463351004693
In the planning of laser surgery for ENT operations, the specialist is often consulted by the anesthesiologist to predict possible intubation problems.	0.9998373307407183
Intubation problems in such operations can occur frequently due to the pathological findings present in the upper aerodigestive tract and the different constructions of laser-resistant endotracheal tubes.	1.0973488796475623
The aim of this study was to determine if a known predictive parameter could have a sufficient sensitivity and specificity to reliably predict possible intubation problems for ENT-related laser surgery.	0.962219470430065
In a prospective study, 91 patients were included and the Mallampati-score modified by Samsoon and Young was analyzed and compared to a score describing the actual conditions of intubation.	1.0590391375685995
The results showed a significant correlation (p <0.05, Chi-Square test).	1.1801934676234214
However, the specificity was only 72% and the sensitivity of 60% was too low to be of practical use.	1.3752478506341566
The results were independent of the endotracheal tube used.	1.0176667030728954
Although use of the laser for ENT operations provides a special situation for the anesthesiologist, there is still no system that is sensitive and specific enough to be of practical use.	1.1536513537561361
This problem is demonstrated in a literature  review.	0.9546080566574062
The treatment of patients with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism with contraindications for a thrombolytic therapy is a therapeutic challenge.	1.1101293822674656
We report on a 12 year old patient who was treated for large cell lymphoma according to NHL-BFM 95: Block AA protocol.	1.1130649915866182
During his therapy, he developed a thrombosis of his right femoral vein and pulmonary embolism affecting the left segments 4, 5, 8, and 9.	1.1516962970588995
Because of cerebral metastasis a fibrinolytic therapy was contraindicated.	0.7170651495288419
Therefore, we performed a mechanical thrombectomy using the Amplatz thrombectomy device.	1.0837838586715018
The postinterventional scintigraphy showed a markedly improved pulmonary perfusion; dopplersonography 4 months postinterventionally showed a patent right femoral vein.	0.7922165386657373
Within this chapter, tumors which produce bone matrix (osteoid) or other bone-forming tissues, like cartilage, connective tissue, and cementum or originate within the bone marrow are described.	1.051912053085736
In addition, those lesions are mentioned which, according to the WHO, are typical for the jawbones and are therefore included within the 1992 WHO classification of odontogenic tumors.	1.1847707794499571
Vascular and epithelial tumors which may also be observed in the jaws are not described.	1.004944458119267
All the lesions and tumors reported have in common a more or less similar clinical and radiological appearance.	0.9264808992908907
A precise diagnosis, therefore, can only be established by a sufficient biopsy which should be seen by a pathologist with experience in this field.	1.0326517260573942
In addition to clinical, radiological, and histological appearances, therapeutic necessities are described.	1.1370146695575378
The data from recent publications are taken into account.	0.8403779083725997
This presentation is based on the data collected within the reference registry of the German-Austrian-Swiss Study Group of Tumors of the Face and Jaws (DÖSAK) in Basel.	1.1821861339555804
Between 1987 and 1996 302 patients were treated for colorectal liver metastases.	1.0349080937538326
Out of this pool 252 completely documented cases were analysed.	0.7562499967704066
Forty-five patients (18 %) of this population were 70 years or older at time of admission.	1.2627320202112
In this population 17 major resections and 8 minor liver resections were performed.	0.8678862431999541
In 9 patients irresectable metastases were diagnosed during treatment of the primary tumor.	0.9416151059137804
In 3 cases laparotomy had to be finished as exploration.	0.8396433588675957
Eight patients were treated without surgery.	0.9197054710464625
Mortality after liver resection was 4 %, morbidity 28 %.	1.1357980891660004
The 5-year-survival-rate (Kaplan-Meier) of the R0 resected patients (n = 21) was 44 %.	1.3138894450208582
Comparison between the elderly patients and the younger population shows no significant differences in type and extent of treatment or in stage of disease.	1.1380463843433402
Survival, morbidity and mortality after liver resection also show no significant differences.	1.1134179321281494
These results show that even in elderly patients liver resection for colorectal metastases can be performed efficently and with a curative intention.	1.0620221046232785
The clinical course of 12 patients with mushroom poisoning was evaluated in order to define the parameters considered to be relevant to the indication for liver transplantation.	1.1517750717175457
Eight patients recovered under conservative therapy; one patient died due to pre-existing, concomitant cardiopulmonary disease.	0.9402488936584393
In three patients transplantations had to be performed because of severe liver failure.	1.137048880792058
On admission, the transplanted patients had a decreased Quick's test score and factor V value (< 10 %).	0.8952344745445099
The peak of liver enzymes, serum bilirubin, serum creatinine, partial thromboplastin time and azotemia were not of any prognostic value.	1.1499934298968528
Main indications for liver transplantation were a very low initial Quick's test score and factor V value (both < 10 %) and their inadequate response under substitution therapy.	1.052020041104492
The development of encephalopathy and renal failure were further parameters indicating poor prognosis.	0.8499282099689135
During submaximal isotonic back extension loading (31 male persons) surface-EMG was measured using 16 monopolar-linked electrodes in the low back region (L 3-S 1).	1.0580649087614684
By means of modification of amplitude- and frequency parameters in the EMG-signal two subject groups (6 persons each) with the slightest and most severe muscle fatigue in the paraspinal region were defined.	1.2079542243940764
For the analysis of muscle coordination, the EMG signal on the basis of an amplitude estimate at the beginning and at the end of the load situation was compared.	1.1423231601991706
During the extension phase, the group with slight fatigability showed no different spatial pattern of myoelectrical activity at the end of investigation than at the beginning.	1.0673028833324034
In contrast to this, the pattern of myoelectrical activity changed during the endurance test in the group of persons with considerable fatigability.	1.0442139790643965
Therefore, in addition to the muscular fatigue also the loss of muscle coordination has to be taken into account in the assessment of spinal function.	1.1927881050940812
Background: A fractional flow reserve (FFRmyo) <0.75 is a well validated parameter for significance of coronary stenoses in cases of normal myocardial function.	1.478132733367747
We used the FFRmyo limit in patients with impaired myocardial perfusion by myocardial infarction and/or hypertension for intermediate stenoses of the LAD for decision to PTCA and checked the indication by clinical follow-up.	0.9971769072219993
Distraction osteogenesis of the mandible is one treatment option in mandibular hypoplasia.	0.96065291174
Usually, a non-continuous distraction mode is applied.	1.15169447943902
The aim of the present study was to establish continuous bone distraction using a microhydraulic cylinder.	1.0298168562100098
Using a submandibular approach, the mandible was dissected subperiostally on one side in four mini-pigs; corticotomy was performed and the microhydraulic cylinder fixed with two bicortical screws.	1.0194345142836274
The hydraulic tube was connected with an automatic hydropneumatic injector system.	0.7435438321822568
Following 7 days at rest, a continuous distraction of 1.5 mm per day was performed for 14 days.	1.3352379283195572
After 2 and 4 weeks postoperatively, the animals were killed and X-rays taken.	1.2446168400228892
The mandible was then removed en bloc and microscopic evaluation of the sections was performed.	0.9066524582431301
The microhydraulic cylinder was easy to apply and to handle.	0.7180671331275932
The continuous stimulus did induce direct mineralisation of longitudinal oriented collagenous fibre bundles.	0.6934241866432084
Bony regeneration seems to be accelerated, which might reduce the postoperatively stabilizing phase.	1.081751083760663
The duration of spinal anaesthesia in infants is short compared to adult patients.	0.8429863539646104
When tetracaine is used, the addition of epinephrine significantly prolongs the duration.	0.8297264223528392
For bupivacaine, however, the influence of epinephrine on the duration is not clear.	0.9895102032022347
We investigated the effects of epinephrine 1: 200 000 added to bupivacaine 0.5% on duration and haemodynamics.	0.9946495567381927
Ten former pre-term infants with postnatal respiratory problems, scheduled for bilateral inguinal hernia repair, were enrolled in the study after informed parental consent had been obtained.	1.0292518127545587
The infants were fasted at least 4 h prior to surgery.	0.6694766231887427
If they did not receive i.v.	0.6034373261343805
infusions before surgery, a bolus of 10 ml/kg Ringer's acetate was injected after inserting the i.v.	0.8838400953194995
cannula, followed by a continuous infusion of 8 ml/kg 2/3 N NaCl with 5% dextrose.	1.0976788047465327
Spinal anaesthesia was performed in a sitting position with 0.6 ml bupivacaine 0.5%.	1.150642419109633
Five patients received plain bupivacaine (group I) and five bupivacaine with epinephrine 1: 200 000 (group II).	1.1070551861208517
Heart rate registered by ECG and non-invasive blood pressure were recorded prior to positioning the baby for lumbar puncture and 2, 5, 10, and 20 min after injection of bupivacaine.	1.0131805592820515
The duration of spinal anaesthesia was defined as the time from injection to the time when the first movements of the legs were observed after stimulation.	1.241896648086973
For testing statistical differences the U test was used between the groups and the Wilcoxon and Wilcox test within the groups.	0.9315006133212802
Results (expressed as median and range).	0.716824590986695
Additional epinephrine significantly prolonged the duration of spinal anaesthesia (group II: 95 min [60 - 120] vs group I: 50 min [37 - 85]).	1.1836814991602325
Haemodynamic parameters did not differ at any time between or within the groups.	0.8609008045311946
In group I, one infant had high spinal anaesthesia with impaired respiration but without cardiovascular effects; after 10 min of assisted ventilation by mask, sufficient respiration as judged by pulse oximetry and clinical observation had returned.	1.0252017849242128
The duration of spinal anaesthesia in this child was 60 min.	0.8735865540221326
Epinephrine 1: 200 000 significantly prolongs the duration of spinal anaesthesia in former preterm infants.	0.7880118617225911
Haemodynamic parameters in this age group remain unchanged during spinal anaesthesia and are not influenced by the addition of epinephrine.	0.9332793297902956
Purpose: Debate about the potential implementation of Spiral-CT in diagnostic algorithms of pulmonary embolism are often focussed on sensitivity and specificity in the context of comparative methodologic studies.	1.118302838294108
We intend to investigate whether additional factors might influence this debate.	0.9027537811598855
Familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) should be an "evidence-based" diagnosis derived from clinical and echocardiographic screening of informed and consenting relatives of index patients, and on the examination of clinical reports for deceased relatives.	0.9944649385948999
Most familial dilated cardiomyopathy pedigrees show an autosomal pattern of inheritance.	0.7649772076463778
