Although a study produced by the Commission would doubtless be interesting, we do not need another to add to those already available.	1.4536465767399749
We do need to obtain, from the Commission and the Council, in other words from each of the governments forming the Union, a clear, positive or negative, political stance. They must indicate whether they are ready to defend, within competent public bodies such as the International Monetary Fund in the first instance, the appropriateness of such a tax within the other instruments needed to stabilise the international monetary system.	1.462011588782781
As for the argument that this initiative would increase uncertainty, very short-term capital movements are specifically intended to play on uncertainty and to bet on changes between currencies or various short-term financial assets.	1.1097960157170155
This argument is therefore not relevant.	0.8763300861666841
I will not go into the basic issue any further for everyone has their arguments.	0.9899395217902904
However, I would highlight not only paragraph 9 of the motion, but also paragraph 10.	1.5489870979134859
We clearly expect a political stance to be taken with a very firm deadline of the preparations for the autumn session of the International Monetary Fund. We therefore demand, if this motion is adopted tomorrow, that the Commission and Council appear before Parliament to tell us what positions they will take on this occasion.	1.4649157239573827
Madam President, my Group is extremely delighted that this debate is taking place today, particularly as we have spared no effort along with Members of other groups to bring this about.	1.3911396964178016
Obviously we all have different approaches which is demonstrated by our debate and the motions for a resolution tabled at the beginning.	1.237791829064694
Having said this, our Group is pleased about the step forward which the compromise motion represents. This invites the Commission to present a report within six months.	1.2730895164183849
The European Parliament can play its role by taking the initiative, even if it does so timidly, on this subject. However, I agree with the previous speaker that, if paragraph 9 were challenged, this motion would clearly lose its substance.	1.574606493809712
This debate concerns a vital question which increasing numbers of people are legitimately raising. What are the respective places of people and finance in today' s economy?	1.1919000567335294
USD 1 800 billion is the volume of money moved every day in the world' s currency markets. This represents over a quarter of the annual global volume of trade in goods and services.	1.1490368675758194
By putting finance at the helm, this has reinforced the demands of profitability and toughened the operating conditions everywhere.	1.1656351196151287
It has led to a growth in mergers, acquisitions and company restructuring and to gigantic sums being raised with increasing frequency on the financial markets.	0.8774436553950741
Unemployment and pressure on employees worldwide is increasing.	0.6644992550506008
Openings and real growth are being hampered and the sudden influx or withdrawal of speculative capital is threatening the economies of many countries, to the point of collapse, as in Asia, Russia and Brazil.	1.216521602553502
Faced with this neoliberal globalisation dominated by the financial markets, demand, as our motion recognises, is developing from a different idea of the world in which common law stipulates a duty of solidarity in an increasingly interdependent world.	1.3667790261990271
No one can ignore the challenge to civilisation posed by the lack of nearly one billion jobs and the need to make unprecedented efforts in terms of development and access to information.	1.0452332501076511
In this respect, all ideas deserve to be considered, including the Tobin tax which is important, just like other forms of transaction which may be envisaged.	1.2801810352790786
This tax could help to check speculation without penalising the activities of the real economy. It could release new resources for investment in people and, at a time when the UNDP estimates the sum needed to eradicate poverty to be USD 40 billion per year, it could allow access for everyone to drinking water and satisfy health needs.	1.2228281063184525
When the debate on the ability of politics to influence economics goes global, the establishment of this tax could become one of the symbols of the political desire to recapture the democratic areas seized by the international financial operators.	1.2727548450294448
The Commissioner has said that a minimum number of industrialised countries would be needed to achieve this.	1.091863436346598
I would point out that the European Union is composed of a large number of industrialised countries and, like Mr Désir and several other speakers, I feel that the European Union which we are forming can take the initiative in this respect.	1.4617107693383273
In any case, the European Parliament would be honoured to take up the call of the people to control the world in order to achieve a sense of well-being for everyone.	1.401027322319632
Madam President, I too am delighted that we are having this debate. I only regret that it has been so long in coming.	1.5478549102170973
We know that each generation has, over the course of time, blindly bought into what could be called a dominant ideology. This is a set of prejudices accepted as such due to a general conformism, but whose dramatic nature can be seen by subsequent generations.	1.3370670597787497
Free trade and the constant worship of globalisation are now the dominant ideology or, rather, the big mistake of our fin de siècle. This ideology is as dangerous as the former ideology of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the corridors of the Kremlin or, before that, the certainty, elevated to the status of a dogma, that the earth was flat.	1.2432896608544517
Our world is now dominated by a single logic or, I could say, a single god of money at work instead of people at work.	1.366793514903025
With a figure for trade in goods and services of FRF 36 000 billion only being equal to the product of four days' speculation, the financial bubble owes very little to the productive activity of individuals.	1.0746520333473544
It is self-perpetuating in a world of ever higher bids which constantly denies the humanity of man, the rich as much as the poor. Yet it is the latter who, at the end of the day, are excluded from the majority of the world' s decision-making centres for these are monopolised by a tiny minority referred to recently, and very aptly, by Jean-Pierre Chevènement as the globalised élites.	1.3389265684426703
It was natural that these élites would exclude any political concerns from their field of manoeuvre, thus protecting themselves from any democratic control and basically managing to be both illegitimate and irresponsible.	1.012142434172369
However, the people are fighting back, as demonstrated by their reaction during the incredible Seattle Summit. The leaders of the world, headed unfortunately by the European Commission, rushed forward submissively, hoping that their docility at the feet of the master of the world, Mr Clinton, would be enough to ensure them the scraps from the table.	1.3245593558383055
Yet they reckoned without the salutary reaction of the nobodies, both individuals and States. This reaction was more organised than previously, due in France particularly to the magnificent ATTAC network which is fighting with increasing support to limit free trade in general and to establish taxation of international financial transactions in particular.	1.2264583765960282
The creation of this taxation, of either the Tobin type or the more realistic type proposed by Professor Lauré, could prove to be politically opportune, at least due to its symbolism rather than its low rate. This is because it would basically mean that politics was regaining a foothold in an area from which it has been excluded by operators whose profits are proportional to the degree of resignation of States.	1.2352524084619403
Madam President, although some of the aims of the Tobin tax are fairly worthy of support, introducing the tax exclusively within the territory of the European Union, as the first area of the world to do so, would sound the death knell for the European currency markets.	1.4933336899599658
If the world' s other important currency trading areas were to be excluded from the Tobin tax, the fact that tax was liable to be paid in Europe would lead to currency dealing moving to those areas.	1.1371671043332139
This has already been made clear a number times in this debate.	0.9981665301316505
It is not enough that all the world' s industrialised countries should be included in the scheme, as then currency trading would move to tax havens outside that group of countries.	1.171504730638465
There should therefore be a universal application: it is not enough that the G7 countries or the other industrialised countries are involved.	1.2083299514467234
On the other hand, it would be so difficult to bring the scheme into force everywhere in the world at precisely the same time - and personally speaking, I do not believe we can achieve this - that the Tobin tax dream might as well be buried.	1.499774156934276
Furthermore, although there might be international consensus on the introduction of the scheme, the question would remain regarding how the tax revenue would be distributed.	1.3961271853509416
The world' s currency dealing centres will hardly agree to the tax revenue being used, for example, for a variety of well-meaning, UN-backed purposes throughout the world without a considerable amount of the revenue remaining with them.	1.1323301332616325
With regard to the Tobin tax as a means of preventing future currency crises, it has to be realised that the causes of a currency being overvalued cannot be averted through taxation.	1.1185682218020148
For that reason, as Mr Karas also said, we should give more attention to the policies that lead to a certain currency being overvalued in relation to its actual potential value.	1.3991308557773368
This again would require measures to regulate the exportation and importation of capital; otherwise it would not be possible to focus on policies in this way.	1.0730803381069274
Although it seems a reasonable scheme, the Tobin tax is not without its problems, even if there should be agreement as to its implementation, which I do not believe there will.	1.520547468840468
It has to be remembered that money at present is first and foremost information, and that the global economy will, in the future, rotate more and more on the basis of information and intellectual capital.	1.331786037486006
For that reason, the uninterrupted flow of assets in massive volumes between the world' s financial centres is not merely speculative activity, which has nothing to do with the real economy.	1.2046319779453714
If this 'feedback' mechanism, which gives users the opportunity to make choices, were hampered by measures such as the Tobin tax, mistaken decisions might be made that turned out to be so costly in terms of the economic consequences that the tax would never be able to make up for it.	1.285383329681974
Hence, as Mr Karas has stated to his credit, our Group is resolutely opposed to the introduction of the Tobin tax.	1.2732028947189584
Madam President, I speak as someone who is in support of a tax on speculative capital movements across currency borders.	1.1887893307764377
It seems to me blindingly self-evident that some action is necessary.	0.9656282910079117
In the last 30 years, the volume of currency transactions has increased by 83 times: firstly, total global reserves of all central banks barely amounts to one day of foreign exchange trading; secondly, annual global trade in real goods and services equals just three-and-a-half days of foreign exchange markets out of 350, that is, 1% of capital movements are for trade in goods and services and 99% are for speculation.	1.1023051021549357
The size, unpredictability and irrationality of the global foreign exchange markets have made it harder and harder to manage national and regional economies.	0.9685005513007268
Computer-controlled selling programmes turned a random blip into an avalanche, burying jobs, lives and industries across the globe.	0.8045094569951339
The only arguments against it are: firstly, it would impair the efficiency of the foreign exchange market - a little fanciful in light of the financial feeding frenzies we have seen that have destroyed jobs throughout the world, in East Asia, Europe and Latin America.	1.4387845773930636
Mr Chirac has described those who engage in this as the Aids virus of the world economy.	1.097245444686941
What is necessary is to throw some sand into the wheels of the currency speculators, stockbrokers and option traders.	0.9316823328965131
Of course, this cannot be done in one country; it cannot be done within the single currency area, but it could be done at international level with global cooperation.	1.5649737574078066
Europe, Japan and the US - the euro, the yen and the dollar, would constitute, in my opinion, such a block.	1.4713570468801218
I am disappointed in the EPP.	0.8429526677055111
I thought at least they read the resolutions they were going to vote on.	0.8750170220238078
Yes, I am in favour of such a tax, but it is not what we are going to vote on tomorrow.	1.3564917448653786
What we are going to vote on tomorrow is to ask the Commission to study the matter, to look at what steps and what conditions would be necessary for the introduction of such a tax.	1.3678110535389338
Equally I understand the Commissioner failing to endorse such a tax, but I cannot understand why he failed to have the courage to welcome the opportunity to demonstrate the truth of his position by a study of the issue.	1.2307498249324753
There is nothing so closed as a closed mind.	1.010963581773649
The tax has the support of 47% of the people in the UK, according to a recent survey by War on Want.	1.286570345161429
In France it has had enormous resonance, particularly when linked to a demand to use the proceeds to help the Third World out of its debt and poverty.	1.2311605190020698
This issue can no longer be ignored by Parliament, the Council or the Commission.	1.334631928718749
There is now a weight of public opinion demanding an answer more sophisticated than: "It has not been done before".	1.1658660242226484
In the new millennium, with new global problems requiring new global solutions, they need to give good arguments why it cannot be done now, rather than why it has not been done in the past.	1.3258172914745263
Madam President, Commissioner, a compromise resolution on the usefulness of a tax on international financial flows would constitute a first step towards the essential amendment of many international rules.	1.1587640893640994
I have two or three points to make in this respect.	1.2241882663311738
One of the main demands of the demonstrators in Seattle was, rightly, the establishment of this type of tax, and this is not by chance.	1.4341481358099513
The proposal of this tax today sends out a strong signal from the rich European countries proving that they want to move away from the culture of egoism.	1.0664080912188423
Everyone feels that this kind of joint tax is a virtuous measure which does not prevent trade but is aimed primarily at speculation and its perverse effects. The Members on the right should note this.	1.184607310218391
It symbolises the need for solidarity with the countries of the south, particularly those in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific which questioned us extensively on this subject in Seattle.	1.1904981721176886
In order to fully achieve its objective, the money supply released by such a tax must be redistributed among the poorest countries.	1.1295555659167875
This is how we can give sense and morality to the commercial rules and show solidarity with the people of the south.	1.2198760257588652
Madam President, we cannot just keep repeating the number which several previous speakers have quoted; we must also mention the fact, Commissioner, that 80% of these huge, daily foreign exchange sales have an investment term of no more than eight days.	1.3283567613433533
We cannot maintain a situation in which investments and the creation of jobs are less lucrative than short-term sales of foreign currency and shares.	0.9318088405080616
We cannot maintain a situation in which we allow ourselves to destroy the opportunity to take political action.	0.9256973660437137
We cannot maintain a situation in which income from non-economic activities increases more and more quickly.	0.803319068417195
It has been demonstrated in Germany that income from monetary assets has almost doubled from 7.6% of overall economic income since Tobin developed his idea.	0.9878082792198907
We cannot maintain a situation in which the poorest countries of the world are most exposed to the speculative arguments surrounding short-term currency fluctuations.	1.09410157819608
Nor do I believe that this is impracticable.	1.2047397150048589
Why should it not be possible for the G7 countries, the other EU Member States, China, Singapore and Switzerland to come to an agreement on the introduction of the Tobin tax?	1.3131191431247506
There must be an overriding economic interest.	0.8742213670074835
Why should it be impracticable, and it can be differentiated, to impose this tax on spot foreign exchange transactions, all the so-called cash transactions, currency futures and options?	1.2985776006920735
Why should it be impracticable to set this tax at a rate which does not jeopardise the long-term investments needed by the economy but which finally makes short-term and speculative investments unattractive.	1.0319454449100105
Numerous very difficult questions are bound to arise, but the only real problem which I can see so far is one of political will and the St. Florian principle of shifting responsibility from one agency to another which has now taken hold.	1.2703586461768879
Madam President, we are not asking for more bureaucracy, as Mr Karas put it just a few minutes ago.	1.45363134179314
We are looking for solutions.	0.6533511847935213
Of course capital markets need clarity - that is actually the idea.	1.294419420475532
The Tobin tax will bring some transparency to a very obscure question.	1.0919214284000887
"The more progress is made towards trade liberalisation, the more rules are needed", as Commissioner Lamy said during the Millennium Round in Seattle.	1.3091368664206608
He recognised that the combined impact of the single market and the single currency that characterise the process of the European Union's construction is intimately linked to a huge amount of new regulations.	1.128385691213087
Now that financing is readily available across national boundaries without any difficulty the same approach will obviously be strictly necessary, all the more so as we consider that an enormous amount every single day is employed in speculative transactions.	1.1097238228528137
We citizens of the world cannot afford the current rate of speculation.	1.3279018912258296
To continue would be economic suicide.	0.6215941402818844
Honourable Members, Commissioner, it is often said that Europe has succeeded in stabilising the economic sector, but this is only true if we confine ourselves purely to the public sector.	1.4049557978113996
If we look at the private sector, however, we will find not only that this fabled 'financial stability' has been unsuccessful but that we are most probably sitting on a volcano ready to erupt at any moment.	1.1807071728773906
The debt burdens of the private sector and the corresponding excessive inflation of Stock Exchange securities, the two main market stability indicators, have, for some time, been at danger levels, as the Commission report on the economic situation in Europe clearly illustrates.	1.4269317793764145
The fact that the public accepts such rates and does not just abandon all financial activities in a panic can be explained by overambitious expectations over future gains.	1.061032997265988
Speculative activities are growing beyond measure and are, in turn, generating profits which will eventually prove to be merely fictitious.	1.0271477777692528
Over-optimism will give way to disappointment and fear, which, in turn, will result in a stock market and economic crisis.	1.1858840466046814
The danger is too great for us to ignore.	0.8123387643574645
We ought to face it regardless of how difficult it may seem.	0.9881619232812547
Modern economic science has provided an exceptional instrument with the Tobin proposal and others, which we will be able to use if we have the political will to make a start.	1.3308507258469235
That is what we are lacking, Commissioner: the political will to make a start in tackling speculation.	1.387701749713316
No longer should there be a place in democracy for the worship of, or for this fatalist approach towards, market forces as adopted by the liberals - and I am sorry that Mr Gasòliba I Böhm has left - as this will only lead to its ruin.	1.270299351361891
Madam President, Mr Bolkestein, the ignorance surrounding this debate is unbelievable.	1.4420244628426353
We needed a Greek Member to finally tell us what this Tobin tax means.	0.8535574625760475
You reject it flatly because you do not understand the first thing about it.	1.0787234196330417
That the Right opposes taxes is quite understandable, except that they should never have been allowed to spirit their millions, or rather billions, into Switzerland.	1.3004287669237393
We all know that!	0.8733251633315795
But now I call on you, in all consciousness, to help put a stop to speculative financial transactions and undermining long-term projects with long-term capital.	1.443805411878623
It has never been done in south-east Asia, it has never been done in Europe, and I can understand why Mr Karas from Austria has left the chamber, given Austria' s financial record.	1.3927552923189979
They are all tarred with the same dirty brush!	1.0300831858809665
We need a Tobin tax to give us a fiscal instrument with which we can intervene.	1.394533185384625
Madam President, I am totally appalled by the Commission' s, i.e. Mr Bolkestein' s, political ignorance!	1.608012305035747
He should perhaps use his position on the Tobin tax to ask himself why he is here at all!	1.0546613742124817
Madam President, I too have found parts of the debate quite bizarre.	1.427130828555735
It is perhaps not by chance that the Conservative benches have emptied because that which is represented as market freedom no longer has anything in common with the noble principles of the social market economy which has brought so much prosperity to us here in western Europe over recent decades.	1.0772594877867405
If we continue down this path, and this is the ideology, and declare the financial markets to be sacrosanct and even claim that any intervention in the workings of these markets is contrary to progress and contrary to the growth of the economy, then we will quite certainly be on the wrong tack and that could take on quite dangerous proportions.	1.2773422296818542
Those who own the monetary assets are currently amassing huge fortunes which are again screaming out to be reinvested.	0.8511374472497945
We have asset inflation of global proportions.	0.6456229819511731
As a result, speculative bubbles continually arise on the financial markets, causing growing economic instability which, in turn, jeopardises the entire economy.	1.0401577821159511
And it is precisely the medium-sized undertakings and large numbers of employees who suffer as a result.	1.1924082742149804
We can take action against this; it is possible.	1.4863587747673164
The minimum requirements for this would be for a proper study to be carried out at long last, not only by the Commission, but by reputable economic institutes throughout Europe.	1.2692756965860685
That too is feasible.	0.6673684357788827
And then perhaps everyone will stop bandying about arguments which are asking for trouble!	0.8392370761161904
It is not correct that the Tobin tax is technically impracticable - it is quite feasible in the age of the computer.	1.4410294312665857
The fact that tax havens are frequently nothing but hard disk storage space for large European banks here at home must not be ignored.	1.0227562647534567
In short, we must not allow real capital and speculative capital to become so remote from each other, because otherwise we shall be steering towards situations which we experienced on this continent time and again during the last century and which had catastrophic results.	1.2673011966696814
Madam President, let us indeed tax money speculation: it does not produce anything new.	1.1795196066667666
The tax would be targeted at the right place: at the speculators.	1.112819691724008
Who is going to defend these speculators, when nurses and teachers are paying top rates of tax?	0.9810458613218322
Article 73 c of the Treaty establishing the European Union provides scope for taxation on transactions.	1.357600462990819
Those who oppose taxation on currency dealing are in favour of those tax-recycling centres, the tax havens, of which there are 62 in all.	1.2257133967386
The Union should make a tax pact, which any countries could initially be party to.	1.2361651258303719
The low rate Tobin tax would not cause tax-recycling problems.	0.8713685978713369
It is strange to claim that if everyone is not included it would be impossible to bring into effect.	1.1037593613523424
The European Union was founded through the efforts of just a few countries, and you see how we are today.	1.6514701154601417
The truth is the greatest problem is a political one: they do not want to tax capital, but raise personal taxation instead.	1.3543728838086613
In the end tax would politicise the global, undemocratic system of financial power.	1.043203977547712
Ladies and gentlemen, we must challenge the monopoly the world' s speculative elite have on planning the world' s economy by remaining outside the tax system.	1.2288398463364392
Madam President, may I begin by extending a heartfelt thanks to all speakers and, above all of course, Mr Désir, for the fact that this debate is taking place this evening.	1.5356838738685943
Whatever one may think about the topic of debate, it is evident that it is an important one.	1.2534084463234823
This is why it has been around for years, and it is satisfying that the Commission is being afforded the opportunity this evening to give a response.	1.4173085494206075
I would like to start by underlining two remarks made by the Member of your Parliament, Mr Gasòliba.	1.4411964726627164
He said that globalisation is a positive phenomenon, and I share his view.	1.5701280031971143
I believe that globalisation has helped many countries which, so far, have been on the sideline of the world trade streams to participate in these and be incorporated into the world trade system and, as far as I am aware, no country has ever been worse off by participating in international trade.	1.3814322907503613
In other words, as indeed already remarked by Mr Gasòliba, globalisation is, in my view, positive, and I am of the opinion that it has contributed to a new international distribution of labour which has been pursued by many people for many years.	1.4212443997037079
A second remark made by Mr Gasòliba was that there is currently no evidence that the Tobin tax will stabilise the exchange rates.	1.1676743688641356
I think that he is correct in this regard.	1.2962737959993165
I too am not aware of any reason why a tax on exchange rate transactions would lead to a stabilisation of exchange rates.	1.0214625548477732
I am of the opinion that these are two important remarks, and that is why I am reiterating them here.	1.2268960489300889
Madam President, could I furthermore point out that none of the speakers this evening has drawn a link between the Tobin tax on the one hand and the functioning of the European Union on the other?	1.41704000480172
Surely we are all familiar with the Treaty of Rome and know that one of the four freedoms is the freedom of capital movement.	1.2463362914206075
Madam President, I can assure your Parliament that my day-to-day work consists partly of attempting, in conjunction with my offices and colleagues, to completely integrate the financial markets within Europe, thus enabling financial transactions to run as easily and smoothly as possible.	1.3331784836197134
In my capacity as Commissioner for the Internal Market, I am, in other words, opposed to all measures which hamper international financial transactions.	1.2601711456895972
You could hardly expect this Commissioner to agree with a tax which would, in fact, impede international economic movement.	1.066046102303056
Once again, the Tobin tax is, in my view, at odds with the Treaty of Rome, and this is an important, theoretical objection which has not been considered by any of the speakers this evening.	1.3961205952934035
Madam President, apart from these - to my mind - quite fundamental observations, there are also practical objections to the Tobin tax, as already underlined by Mr Karas and other speakers.	1.517883062274859
It has unfortunately been observed, I have to say, that the European Union has failed to reach agreement internally on specific tax measures. This indicates how difficult these dossiers are.	1.3628107214838685
If we have not been able to reach agreement internally, I wonder whether we will then be able to convince the other trade partners.	1.427215047325024
I think that this will be problematic.	1.0718908629830777
Madam President, Mr Jonckheer has stated that this could be one of the measures for stabilising the financial markets.	1.3638672001892305
I think, however, that instability is merely a symptom and that we should be looking at the underlying causes. I think that it is preferable to fight the causes rather than attempt to tackle the symptoms when this is probably not possible and when, as already stated, the measure concerned is pretty certainly at odds with the Treaty of Rome.	1.253704264856267
In order to remove these causes, one has to look at what is happening in the countries in question.	1.404874034522904
Is it the case that these countries can boast of what is termed in English 'good governance' ?	1.0218616306233548
Is it the case that there is low inflation and that there are low interest rates?	1.0650688472828649
That the markets for production factors, including the labour market, operate flexibly?	1.178737562030476
That is not always the case.	0.7755123239349023
So if we want to look into what causes exchange rate instability, then we need to take into account the elements of good governance and focus on these first.	1.2623223225667088
In addition - and this has also been mentioned already, for example by Mr Gasòliba I Böhm, but also by others - there is a need for more supervision.	1.4238079665843304
More supervision nationally - supervision by national governments of national banks - and internationally, for example by means of the IMF.	1.429854485786171
So I believe the best way to tackle the causes is by ensuring, on the one hand, that good governance is observed in the countries in question and that, on the other hand, there is more supervision nationally and internationally in order to avoid these lapses.	1.473718533671235
Madam President, according to various Members of your Parliament, more funding should still be made available for major projects.	1.3859740394807414
For example, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler spoke in English about 'long-term capital for long-term projects' - this is an obvious issue.	1.4494746779834835
My reply to this is that, firstly, countries should honour their pledges, namely make 0.7% of their Gross National Product available for development aid and cooperation, so that a great deal more money becomes available than at present for such long-term projects and via a route established for the purpose, namely contributions to development cooperation, and not via an artificial and probably harmful route, namely the Tobin tax.	1.390475273403913
Madam President, I should like to leave it here. As far as the resolution is concerned, of which I have seen a draft, the Commission will await the vote and will, based on this, determine its stance.	1.5108652568833685
I thank you for giving me the opportunity to take part in this debate.	0.7881124443751166
I have received four motions for a resolution, tabled pursuant to Rule 40(5) of the Rules of Procedure.	1.0834504457185765
Madam President, unfortunately I do not have your mastery of the French language.	1.7498597934061781
But I would be obliged if Mr Bolkestein would just listen for a minute, which I think he cannot do at the same time as talking to Mrs Randzio-Plath.	1.4527200837644323
Could you please draw his attention to the fact that I have something to say to him?	1.2817017708568978
Monsieur Bolkestein, je veux vous dire quelque chose!	0.6379585320555456
Unfortunately, my Dutch is not as good as yours.	1.4335448725868642
But I would rather like to say something else to you.	1.4909431266006397
Parliament is not taking the initiative and supporting a Tobin type tax just to annoy the Commission.	1.0560877193075637
We want to examine the possibility of introducing a Tobin tax.	0.9490819168258509
It will be just one of several instruments and hopefully you will be on our side in this.	1.1905867281654476
From a political point of view, I always fret when people say, we neither need, want nor can we achieve these things!	1.403871406638052
It is not your job, it is our job to decide on that.	1.4656252768299516
It also has something to do with the newly awoken self-consciousness of this Parliament.	0.9872747103278341
I just want to discuss it with you, no more and no less.	1.2891056389624544
We can do so without going off at other tangents. I respect you as a serious Commissioner who wants to take his work seriously.	1.1699196285384215
Please respect us as Members of Parliament who want to take our work seriously, and that includes the Tobin tax!	1.381748271402217
Madam President, an omission appears to have been made. In the list of tabled motions for a resolution which you have just read out, no mention is made of the compromise motion tabled jointly by the PSE, ELDR, GUE/NGL and Greens/EFA Groups and by Mrs Kuntz and Mr Coûteaux.	1.4483437192644617
Mr Désir, I note your comment and the existence of this joint motion for a resolution.	1.1980142383771821
If the services of the Presidency confirm that this was correctly tabled, it will be included.	1.2845836485889073
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.	0.29695966651602207

Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	0.4510321946745718
Mr President, I simply wanted to pass on some news. There was a terrorist attack this morning in Madrid.	1.198614702717074
Someone planted a car bomb and one person has died.	0.7677153890194329
On behalf of my Group, I once again condemn these terrorist acts.	1.1337892406415198
Thank you, Mrs Fraga Estévez.	1.1414237124965447
We had heard about this regrettable incident.	0.6733861864013816
Unfortunately, the terrorist murderers are once again punishing Spanish society. I note your comments with particular keenness, as you may expect, given that I too am Spanish.	1.4071916078509399
(The Minutes were approved)	0.08791063492812108
Resumption of the session	0.13474910339249976
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 21 January 2000.	0.7924979070371527
Madam President, allow me to remind you that tomorrow will be the second anniversary of the Cermis tragedy.	1.1369301462222918
Two years ago, in Cavalese in Italy, an American aeroplane from the Aviano NATO base cut through the cables of a cable car during a low-flying exercise which exceeded safe limits, causing the deaths of more than 20 Europeans.	1.0603252349524963
Since then, the victims' families, who have not had the consolation of justice, since the pilot responsible has not faced criminal charges, have been awaiting solicitous financial compensation from the United States at the very least.	1.3943718523014625
I therefore appeal to the President of this House and the President of the Commission for them to stand surety for immediate compensation from the U.S. authorities, and this is in order to uphold the rights of the victims' families.	1.3457936298660922
Mrs Angelilli, thank you. I have taken note of your comment.	1.033794427391403
Agenda	-0.0
The next item is the order of business.	0.8689733460833065
Following a request to this effect, which I have received from a number of political groups, and following the meeting of the Conference of Presidents which has just been held, I propose that we add to the agenda a one and a half hour debate on a topical and urgent subject of major importance, pursuant to Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure, on the subject of the European Union' s reaction with regard to the talks in Austria on forming a government.	1.3684353682955506
If you decide to add this debate to the agenda, it will be introduced by speeches from Mr Seixas da Costa, President-in-Office of the Council, and Mr Romano Prodi, President of the Commission.	1.118108277688006
Is there anyone who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal?	0.5755341742272282
Madam President, I would like to express my support for the decision of the Conference of Presidents, and, since I publicly criticised the presidency in January, I would like to take this opportunity to say, both for myself and on behalf of the Socialist Group, that we now find the presidency' s statements on this issue to be appropriate, and we agree on their basis, their importance and their form.	1.3421263352228576
Madam President, it would really be very difficult to imagine a debate which is more in accordance with Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure.	1.3815546517770894
This debate is topical, exceptionally important and urgent.	0.9359956354545304
We therefore believe that the agenda should be amended to include it.	1.3034608334744366
(Applause)	-0.0
Is there anyone who wishes to speak against this proposal?	0.579153275281996
Madam President, I shall speak against this proposal on the grounds of a principle which I consider absolutely vital with regard to observance of the Treaties, and with particular regard to Article 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	1.3925732075951232
Madam President, until now we believed that the European Union was, according to the Treaty of Rome and the Treaty of Paris founding the European Communities, and subsequently the Union, an association of free, independent, sovereign states.	1.5504481679557744
Even though many developments cast doubt on this, we did believe, in spite of everything, that this was the case and, more recently, reference was made, albeit half-heartedly, to the principle of subsidiarity.	1.5745878436530427
Well, patently, if we do open this debate today, Madam President, as you are requesting and as the Conference of Presidents is requesting, on the basis of Rule 50, we shall then be opening up a fearsome breach in the principle of the freedom and sovereignty of the national states and the free constitution of democratically elected governments, enabling some other majority in this Parliament, at some future time, to claim the right to interfere in the formation of a government even though it has assumed power on the basis of free, regular, peaceful and democratic elections within a Member State.	1.4193541147907422
If you ratify ...	0.6203718729768527
Mr Gollnisch, excuse me, you have one minute.	1.0778798574916144
I know that you always take particular care to ensure that the Rules of Procedure are observed.	1.1927348838071024
Madam President, I thought I had three minutes.	1.1347888626690774
Do forgive me.	0.3465618676446732
If you ratify this development, then you are ratifying the development of the Union into a body which violates the sovereignty and the freedom of the Member States, and we should then have no option but to withdraw from such a Union.	1.3844853711637142
We have heard one speaker in favour and one against.	0.7499488972979528
I shall now, therefore, put this proposal for an amendment to the agenda to the vote.	1.2858407046133178
(Parliament gave its assent)	0.06492846330865369
This debate is therefore added at the top of the order of business.	0.8130506740838458
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE	0.2004388419834845
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.	0.4698836304410891
Talks in Austria on forming a government	0.15227902657532158
The next item is the debate on the talks in Austria on forming a government.	0.5664139645336326
I shall immediately give the floor to Mr Seixas da Costa, President-in-Office of the Council.	0.6496642683279802
Madam President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, the Group of the Party of European Socialists hopes that this debate will send three messages to the European public.	1.0755852975679414
Let it be noted that we are completely united on all three counts.	1.067353409216053
Firstly, we wish to express our total support for, and our solidarity with, the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the 14 Member States, because we believe that this statement is in accordance with the common values, and not just the political force, which we have all built together.	1.531602294515687
In any event, these common values are in complete opposition to those held by the party ironically known as the Austrian Freedom Party.	1.0549698444443343
The Europe we are building is born of the bitter experiences we have all suffered, and the Socialist Group condemns the insults which have been directed at the President of the French Republic and the Belgian Government, but also at the Socialists, who are European citizens as well, because, at the moment, the Austrian Socialists are being described as traitors to their country.	1.4239237149600168
I will say one thing. For many years I was a traitor to my country; at least that was General Franco' s view.	1.3471747147111548
President Guterres was also a traitor in Salazar' s eyes, and that is something that I believe should also be stated and defended by the PPE-DE.	1.227179721307316
I also believe that the Commission, or President Prodi, has acted as a guardian of the Treaties.	1.4042536966883903
However, I would remind him that, during his inaugural debate, he described the Commission as a European government.	1.6554453956795232
A government must have more nerve and more courage.	0.8563055217853931
That is what I am asking President Prodi for at this moment.	1.3297796863343598
(Applause)	-0.0
With all due respect to a Commissioner as effective as Mr Fischler, and given that we have heard contradictory comments, depending on the translation, with regard to a possible request by President Prodi for the resignation of Mr Fischler, I would be very grateful if this point could be clarified in this House.	1.3909367052837955
Secondly, Madam President, we wish to send a very clear message to the Austrian people.	1.3308969725529238
This is an appeal to the majority of Austrians who have not voted for Haider, who have voted for the clearly democratic options, committed to Europe, and I must point out that Mr Schüssel may have been Minister for Finance, but Chancellor Vranitzky also contributed to Austria' s integration process.	1.355778032980651
We should not be so politically partisan.	1.0906008795036017
The accession of Austria to the Community was a joint venture.	1.2075534977983093
We all took part in it, not just one group.	1.2286010408940382
Therefore, Madam President, I believe that it is our right and our obligation to ask the Austrians to reconsider and reflect, because this type of menace, which we have suffered before in Europe, may not only harm Austria, but it may also spread, and I say this bearing history in mind.	1.4498020311488085
Therefore, apart from the apology which Mr Schüssel has made, offering us all kinds of guarantees, as did Chamberlain and Daladier in 1938 in Munich, I would like to know whether the PPE intends to implement measures in relation to the Austrian People' s Party, if it goes ahead with this mad project.	1.267798885767176
Thirdly, if we do not stand up to this unnatural alliance, I can assure you that we can forget the European Union' s main objective - enlargement - because, if we were Czechs, Slovenes or Hungarians, what would we say, faced with a neighbour who judges us on racial grounds and does not want us to enter?	1.4082874210938738
I therefore think that this is a great day for European politics to commence.	1.2164976091751067
We support the Council and we believe that it is our right and our obligation to appeal to the Austrian people to seriously reconsider this completely crazy option.	1.1400520791597302
(Applause from the PSE Group)	0.26895271987047414
Madam President, we could have been debating the need to reinforce the founding principles of the Union, so that we can uphold them together.	1.3303949345548547
Instead, we have been forced to debate the formal, substantial errors that have been made in the last few days.	1.3326793960661742
We are astonished by the political naivety of people who, with thoughtless words, have bolstered Mr Haider' s position in Austria and made the Union look ridiculous, riding roughshod over Article 7 of the Treaty by announcing unconstitutional measures.	1.2985270890648197
We have never before seen such serious, clumsy interference in the internal affairs of a Member State.	0.730585417734504
Of course, we cannot violate the founding values of Europe, and in this regard, the Italian Prime Minister stated that these principles are included in a treaty: he mentioned the Treaty of Copenhagen, which I, like you, have never heard of because it does not exist.	1.5815332873790433
Maybe he was referring to the Treaty of Amsterdam, Article 6 of which lists certain principles and Article 7 certain procedures, in order to establish that a Member State is seriously and continuously violating the principles referred to in Article 6.	1.180822305739166
However, up till now, Austria has committed no serious or persistent violation.	1.380892308212091
Apart from amounting to interference, the statement by the Presidency is discriminatory because it authorises the penalisation of a population and denies these people their right to choose who to vote for.	1.0714214087812495
No political cohesion has so far come about, not even in the fight against organised crime, or in defence of the victims of genocide; we do not have a currency that is even remotely stable or an economy which really does combat unemployment and poverty; but it only took one minute of iconoclastic fury to destroy the Union' s credibility.	1.2388881130221179
Sanctions can be imposed after the Treaties have been violated, but cannot be applied if a democratically elected party enters government.	1.1523957943031948
Otherwise, how will we deal with Communist countries which return to Communism: will we throw them out of the Union too if Communists enter into government, or will Stalin' s grandchildren be forgiven for everything?	1.247389659479912
(Applause from the right) It is via diplomacy, persuasion, knowledge, and solidarity, and not with threats or via anti-constitutional means that the institutions can ensure respect for themselves and for principles.	1.328453222474455
Bilateral relations involve the States, so the 14 do not come into this.	1.2839538239071686
This is riding roughshod over the European institutions in order to defend political ways of thinking, with an incompetence worthy of parties which have just emerged from totalitarian regimes. It is not what you would expect of the representatives of democratic traditions.	1.366402027780188
So many things set us apart from Mr Haider - as we have often written - including his claim to the completely Italian Alto Adige region.	1.2621927593044457
However, we already knew this.	1.5081192060995063
However, today we are concerned to learn that other representatives of the Union seem to have turned their backs on the Union' s democratic role.	1.577192655586285
We support legality and democracy as expressed by the peoples, and favour upholding national sovereignty as long as this does not violate the principles of the Treaty or human rights.	1.28497393252133
We believe in Europe, while it seems that others have started the process of breaking up the Union.	1.3480319814703248
This is what has come of rushing headlong into enlargement and not clearly defining roles and tasks.	1.0011177806370328
We have built a Europe with an unstable market, not a Europe with principles, rights and politics.	1.382143504817883
And these are the consequences!	1.15569446477918
Therefore, we can but call on the Commission to continue to show restraint and praise those who are working to safeguard the independence and sovereignty of the Austrian people, thereby ensuring that this people retains its freedoms and maintains good relations with other peoples.	1.3066717377053054
Madam President, today we have an appointment with hypocrisy.	1.3178898903768612
Here we have a Council which has managed to flout the treaty and employ a method completely unrelated to Articles 6 and 7 which make it possible to condemn a State in the event of a serious and persistent breach.	1.05094790195873
In the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach in Austria.	0.8043037563987898
There are risks, as we are all aware, but in the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach.	1.385466543431702
If we were to apply the criteria of Articles 6 and 7 or the Copenhagen criteria to the European Union, then, most certainly, this European Union could not become a member, although the countries of Eastern Europe are required to meet them.	1.461520831607523
And if we were to speak of serious and persistent breaches, then perhaps we could mention some Member States, such as Italy and France, first and third, respectively, in the list of countries condemned by the Council of Europe and the Strasbourg court.	1.430903645920753
We could mention, my Belgian friends, Belgium and the Dutroux case, the dozens upon dozens of children kidnapped, tortured, raped and murdered by leading personalities in this country, where inquiries are bogged down, making no headway.	1.1651111291874332
We could, if one third of the Members of Parliament so requested, require that the Council and the Commission look into the matter.	1.3578853817229184
We could ask ourselves why the Austrians are rejecting 10 years, 13 years of party politics which has made one country - Austria - corrupt and rotten, just as it is now corrupting countries such as Italy, Belgium and other European Union Member States.	1.2086475208798204
We might well wonder why 76% of Belgian citizens have no faith in the justice system in their country or why 56% of French citizens have no confidence in their country' s system of justice, and 53% of Italian citizens have absolutely no confidence in Italian justice...	1.195647337547248
(The President cut the speaker off)	0.0993768251480497
Madame President, my group, the EDD, and especially my party, are very concerned by this debate.	1.6904874648462975
We cannot, and we do not, support in any way the sentiments and politics of Herr Haider and we deplore his references to the Third Reich.	1.235602011585451
We also, however, deplore the fact that your Parliament should consider interfering in the policies of an elected government of any country, especially one which is part of the European Union.	1.3613071090877888
My party at home are certainly not racists, but we do not accept the rule or interference of the European Union very well.	1.391872387092197
Are you going to interfere with Great Britain' s Parliament if we are elected?	1.0208382162067104
Madame President, the people of Austria have spoken by electing Herr Haider to their Parliament.	1.1650189931363752
I believe they gave him 28% of the vote so there is going to be a coalition government.	1.2878141249921389
Your Parliament, may I suggest, Madame President, should wait to see if the party of Haider has an effect on the policies of that country.	1.5237630417929853
Then, and only then, might you consider if human rights are affected.	1.3192082833501255
Your Parliament may consider measures appropriate to counter that situation and then, Madame President and only then, may your Parliament consider interfering in the constitutional affairs of a country of the European Union.	1.1133972509971335
Madam President, as a representative of the Freedom Party, I respect the concerns some of my fellow MEPs have with regard to the democratic developments in Austria.	1.5291614748724824
My reaction may come as a surprise when I say that I personally am at a loss as to the heightened sensitivity displayed towards Austria in matters of respect for human rights, having a sense of responsibility for one' s own past, and the stability of democracy.	1.3359605074824699
Austria must take the responsibility on its own shoulders for the often dubious image other countries tend to have of it, rightly or wrongly.	1.022711511749132
The refusal of our government, down through the years, to acknowledge our complicity in the horrors of the Second World War, together with their refusal to properly compensate the Jewish victims and those forced into hard labour, have done a great deal to bolster this negative image.	1.157836209770452
This FPÖ has now entered into a coalition with the ÖVP, due to the outcome of elections held on 3 October 1999, when the previous government was voted out of office.	1.0654009218752871
This is the citizen of a state' s prerogative, for it is the founding principle of a democracy.	1.474210995036248
When the talks between the SPÖ and ÖVP broke down, the Socialists attempted to form a minority government and asked the FPÖ for their support.	1.0651636322995173
We were offered three ministerial posts - you can read it for yourself in the newspapers - the very party that is being denounced as fascistic here!	1.3269948960851317
When we suddenly refused this offer, an inflammatory and rabble-rousing propaganda campaign began that is beyond our comprehension to this day.	0.9695483586432367
The FPÖ party is established in Austria' s political landscape.	0.9179274335119212
The head of the government of one of the nine provinces belongs to this party and it is involved in all the other provincial governments.	1.2078593514726914
What many Austrians are wondering today is why their democratic decision has suddenly been interpreted as an expression of a fascistic cast of mind, and why the campaign did not begin until the Freedom Party rejected the support of a minority government comprising the SPÖ?	1.1873852824671693
There is prejudice at work here, which - without going into our programme - is reducing the darkest hour of European history to a political spectacle.	1.3699040655243018
I am filled with disgust when certain of our opponents get mileage out of the millions of deaths that took place in the gas chambers of the concentration camps as cheap propaganda, as, for example, the Italian MEP Bertinotti did yesterday on Italian TV when he accused Mr Haider of denying the holocaust.	1.0034724113957172
Shame on you Mr Bertinotti!	0.6140879070167754
You might have run out of political arguments but that does not give you the right to use those who were murdered as cheap propaganda.	1.1047163569255813
Denouncing a democratically elected politician as a Nazi does not make you an anti-fascist!	0.8885901831940411
On the contrary, you are deriding the true victims of National Socialism and playing down what the fascist dictators did.	1.054732689700905
Your behaviour stems from your own prejudices, you are dispensing with any form of political debate and you are displaying precisely the kind of behaviour you claim to oppose.	1.0645812955997802
The attacks against Austria' s new government and the attempts to exert political influence in a Member State are an insult to the Austrian people.	1.0049013606231898
That is why we are indebted to the Commission for taking a stance that separates it from the rest.	1.3308688271591427
The new coalition agreement is about reforming a democracy, the rights of the opposition, commitment to compensating those forced into hard labour....	1.0476424125899098
(The President cut the speaker off)	0.0993768251480497
Madam President, to begin with, I would like to make one thing abundantly clear: Austria is not in danger of experiencing a resurgence of a one-party system or of a totalitarian system of right-wing persuasion.	1.2620089257859104
Austria is a stable democracy; one in which human rights and fundamental freedoms are guaranteed under the constitution and are afforded the protection of an independent judiciary.	1.1686562908072295
Austria is a cosmopolitan country and xenophobia and discrimination have no place there.	0.9330105470032111
There is nothing unusual about what is happening in Austria: there has been a changeover of power following democratic elections, in consequence of which an old system was voted out and a stable parliamentary majority prepared to carry out the necessary economic and social reforms was sought and found.	1.2414845396893972
There will be a functioning majority and likewise a functioning opposition.	1.0070701914779987
The Austrian People' s Party, which I represent here in this Parliament, used to be and still is a party that has consistently spoken up for the integration of my country into the EU and feels deeply attached to the community of values that is the European Union, and likewise its basic political principles of deepening and enlargement.	1.3165631948364944
We respect and accept the discussion that is taking place and also appreciate the concerns that are being voiced in many of our Member States as to the way ahead for Austria.	1.2883823084597101
Our understanding springs from the knowledge that our history of the recent past has bequeathed to us a political responsibility of special importance in the present.	1.1531434513045167
Our country was not just the first victim of the Hitler dictatorship, many people were perpetrators too, although I refute any suggestion of collective guilt.	1.2361824408683086
The ÖVP played no small part in helping Austria find its way into the European Union.	0.823821464769246
My country' s place is not outside the European Union but in it ...	1.1585541392626286
..., with all the rights and commitments that this entails!	1.3147303144964246
Any future government must therefore be judged according to the values and principles it professes to in its manifesto, and not according to the prejudgements put about both by political adversaries and the international media.	1.1891565052539812
A declared belief in human rights, democracy and the rule of law, in an honest reappraisal of Austria' s role in the past, in passing on information on the gravest crime against humanity in the 20th century, the holocaust, will also be reflected in the fundamental accord underlying a future coalition government between the ÖVP and FPÖ.	1.1604695803864258
My party can be relied upon to see to it that my country holds firm to the course of European politics and continues to be rooted in the European community of values!	1.2906817301979028
(Applause)	-0.0
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Representatives of the Commission, it is a black day for Austria and for Europe.	1.0799013211072375
Not even Mr Sichrovsky' s web of lies or Mrs Stenzel' s words of appeasement can do anything to change that.	0.9536133158080555
For the day has dawned: two irresponsible politicians, consumed with a lust for power, are selling Austria' s image, political role, and to some extent even its economic interests, down the river!	1.209083874966332
(Applause, heckling)	0.5921299105996624
They are trading this in for a head of government' s position and for membership of a government.	1.1917287498232105
They are just as prepared to take on board the fact that Austria will go from being a revered country to a reviled one, as they are its threatened isolation and thus to some extent that of its citizens.	1.2452139323650713
I believe - as do many who for years have campaigned against Haider and his brand of politics, and especially my colleagues in the Social Democratic delegation in this Chamber - that the various measures announced by the international community, insofar as they do not have any bearing on the government and its representatives, are grave and also inappropriate.	1.4251535304581244
However, my criticism - and I freely admit this - my rage, is directed exclusively against those who have provoked these reactions and continue to do so, Messrs Schüssel and Haider and their parties, ...	1.4517844134634525
... and that includes their representatives in this Parliament.	1.362015433956042
Mr Poettering, it is interesting to note that you are in almost as difficult a position as I am, albeit for different reasons, for you are having to defend something that goes against your convictions.	1.378984265003426
You are having to defend a certain Mr Schüssel, you are having to consort with Schüssel as he is today and who, as I understand it, was recently told not to come to the representatives of the Christian Democratic party' s summit meeting.	1.2373883026255794
The argument that Mr Poettering himself used has come into play, i.e. that it would only be possible to deprive Haider of his mystique if he were to be integrated into the political system.	1.268456230131475
However, in my view, he will be no more able or willing to be integrated into this, into our political system, and into the Europe of today, than any other extreme right-wing movement.	1.3794884525618136
Anyone who feeds on prejudice towards foreigners and ethnic minorities and gives succour to these prejudices, whose programme features parochialism and anti-liberalism, who displays loutish behaviour and arrogance in their international relations, and who has never yet distanced themselves clearly and unequivocally from National Socialism, has neither the intention nor inclination to integrate!	1.1241482146129835
(Applause)	-0.0
This historic weight of guilt falls on the shoulders of the Conservatives for having consorted with the wolf of their own free will and waiting to be devoured.	0.9343270037701792
That is how the wolf - albeit on account of the self-sacrifice of the ÖVP - is sustained rather than kept in check.	1.1405076433483332
I understand that Europe and the civilised world wants to have as little as possible to do with such a government.	1.351989258790651
However, by the same token, there is another Austria, the one where umpteen thousand people demonstrated against the FPÖ having any involvement in government, and who will continue to demonstrate against this government.	1.554311320727376
I urge you to support this Europe and to support and help this Austria!	1.2100453027028828
(Applause)	-0.0
The more powerful this Europe becomes and the more vigilant it is towards authoritarian tendencies in the Europe of today, the more successful we will be in striking at the roots of right-wing extremism.	1.1521936681642193
For Europe is and will remain the most potent guarantee we have against xenophobia and demagogy, or even against a relapse into barbarism.	1.1622502886824089
Please support the Austrian people against this government!	1.0411458611508293
(Applause)	-0.0
Madam President, this is an historic moment, as it is now, at last, quite clear to us all that the European Union has gradually developed into a community of values.	1.6836530061130344
We see this, now that the government of one Member State is being joined by a party which, as is known, does not respect all these values.	1.2872513028316412
I would also like to say that the position of the fourteen states emanating from the Council was justified, as in a way this is also a matter of the composition of the government of the European Union, meaning this is also a matter for the Council and not merely an internal affair of Austria' s.	1.520510943568546
As Members of Parliament, we must pay particular attention to the fact that the work begun to establish fundamental rights is more important than ever.	1.5217265844432186
It is more important than ever that respect for, and non-violation of, human values and the rights of minorities, including the rights of all those who live within the territory of the European Union, form an essential component in the rule of law principle of the EU, and, for this reason, the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding.	1.4398401894395214
It must not be allowed to remain a mere declaration.	0.777969929523048
As important is the fact that Austria' s forces of democracy should be given support, as none of us wishes to isolate the country.	1.3005555311112142
We know that most Austrians respect these values.	0.9283249503474431
They have also shown how they feel: not all the demonstrations have taken place outside Austria.	1.1104803049815968
Doubtless there are also a lot of protest voters on the scene that have wanted a change in Austrian policy for a long time.	1.0951661855070274
I believe Parliament should support these forces of democracy.	0.7607700479232508
I also appeal to the Austrian President, that he might yet look into all the possibilities for forming a government made up of democratic forces.	1.3116138510139552
Madam President, I would simply like to stress the value of the attitude that the leader of our group, Francis Wurtz, reminded us of just now.	1.3019746891439603
I welcome the statements by the Presidency of the Council and the position of the 14 countries which have rejected official contact with an Austrian Government that includes Jörg Haider' s party.	1.249226718314753
The fact that we are stressing this is all the more important because, as you know, we essentially disagree with the policies made by Europe, with its economic and social policies, its democratic deficit and the Member States' involvement in the terrible war in the Balkans.	1.4626205314993226
Our normal disagreement further emphasises our appreciation today: this is extraordinary because the danger of a resurgence of an irrational, neo-nazi element in Europe is extraordinary.	1.0128552964129298
This danger does not concern Austria, it concerns Europe.	1.3537806652583015
We are talking about us, not Austria.	1.2447503479988384
We know the social causes which contribute, along with unemployment and instability, to fuelling tendencies towards this; we know the accompanying cultural causes - xenophobia, racism - but with the inability and unwillingness of these extreme right-wing groups to settle accounts with nazism, we cannot fail to point out the possibility of an explosive mixture being created in Europe.	1.30883295655867
Not only the Alpine region, but all our countries are involved: the conditions are being created whereby democracy and European civilisation may once again come under threat.	1.3028494224528784
The position taken by the presidency has shown that it is aware of this tragedy for civilisation.	1.1880938000106471
Europe is showing that it has not forgotten Auschwitz; Europe is coming face to face with the suffering of the past.	1.1008139563383479
Now, though, it should follow through with its actions, and the first to follow through should be the Commission, which, however, has been obscure and weak on this, making the value of the presidency' s position even more apparent.	1.5431864140224327
This is the change we must impose on the Commission' s action.	1.3414118860403852
Madam President, despite the fundamental democratic principle of the respect for human rights and the freedom and sovereignty of peoples, which opposes fascism, nazism or communism, both new and old, and despite all the previous speakers talking about the sovereignty of the Austrian people, we are today witnessing this sovereignty being denied by Parliament.	1.4597138324566785
In the manifesto of the Austrian Democratic Freedom Party, there is nothing to justify the accusations that it is attacking the principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms or the rule of law, enshrined in Article 6 of the Treaties.	1.148474918122455
I would, however, like to draw your attention to the fact that the President-in-Office, who has been so critical of Austria, has recently consigned the inhabitants of Macao to the sovereign rule of the People' s Democratic Republic of China.	1.2547451296176446
Perhaps, in order to strengthen the Union' s democracy, it would now be appropriate to isolate Austria and criminalise a party that was democratically elected by the Austrian citizens, while bringing Turkey and its "Grey Wolves" into Europe.	1.3113599787213581
Madam President, we are debating an extremely serious issue.	1.653883525339659
We are debating nothing less than the presence in a Member State' s government of a political force whose doctrine and principles are incompatible with the conceptual and moral bases of the Union enshrined in its founding Treaties.	1.2206854985237428
A simple reading of chapter 4, article 1 of the Austrian Freedom Party' s manifesto is enough to make any democratic conscience shudder.	1.1638100525761759
The view that ethnicity is the defining factor of a nation and the claim that one ethnic group has superiority over others, as is written here, revives old ghosts of the century which we have just left behind, which some historians have described as the century of horrors; horrors which the unacceptable philosophy behind Mr Haider' s manifesto has stirred up once again, to our amazement.	1.2558549900481581
Of course Austria is a sovereign nation and of course we must respect the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of a Member State.	1.0218058927116669
However, that is not the problem.	1.7208066082921847
The question is whether the Union can remain indifferent to the formation of a government in a Member State which includes such a party.	1.1951513945586045
Our answer to this crucial question is no.	0.9004432054959803
Leaving aside strategic and tactical considerations, leaving aside possible exonerations based on other people' s behaviour and above and beyond party and electoral interests, the Spanish delegation of the People' s Group of this Parliament, in full agreement with the Spanish People' s Party and the Spanish Government, clearly expresses its full agreement with the statement of 31 January by the Portuguese Presidency of the Council.	1.2014810311891835
We agree with its substance, its tone and its scope.	1.2417665417991834
(Applause)	-0.0
Konrad Adenauer once said - and he knew what he was saying - that the surest way to pacify a tiger was to allow it to devour you.	1.2712738930545338
History is a compendium of events which could have been avoided.	0.7949421535854079
Therefore, Madam President, the Union and the Assembly must send an unequivocal message, rejecting of the tiger of intolerance, xenophobia and totalitarianism, so as not to add one more mistake to the long list of abdications, renunciations and opportunism which mark Europe' s past and for which we have paid such a heavy price.	1.1359163002145696
(Loud applause)	0.04062958545577951
Madam President, the European Union was built upon the idea 'never again' , meaning never again do we want to see xenophobia, concentration camps, anti-Semitism, heightened nationalism or war.	1.1959611004156803
The one and only significance of the European Union is the will to transcend the atrocious history of the twentieth century which gave the coup de grâce to any ideal of humanism within the heart of Europe, and which is still highly topical today.	1.2532248293030428
It is not true to say that, when a government forms an alliance with neo-Fascists somewhere in Europe, this is merely a question of national sovereignty.	1.3809273662045856
For this Union of ours is not a grouping of neighbouring nation states who are simply coming to mutual arrangements to improve their collective circumstances.	1.0935209195951083
It is a Community that is destined to exist, in which, when the main thing is under threat, when values are under threat, all democrats must bend over backwards to find solutions to ensure that the mistakes of the past are never made again.	1.4292875246553651
Let us learn the lessons of the past.	0.7019586352995375
In the thirties, when Adolf Hitler was democratically elected, although with a minority, many people thought that it was not as bad as all that and, Mr Poettering, in France, a number of men and women, on the right wing but perhaps of other political persuasions too, thought, 'Better Hitler in France than the Front Populaire.'	1.3737550011190043
They put their own petty squabbles first, and the rest is history.	1.3787765785520765
We must make a rapid, strong and united response.	1.1572201857773174
I would have liked to hear your discussion with the Austrian President, Mr Poettering. We are well aware that he is very embarrassed today at the dirty deal that government has done in forming such an alliance.	1.3730592774791994
So our response must be rapid and strong.	0.6757953103966233
Of course, the Treaty provides us with a barrier when things become intolerable; I was almost going to say 'irreparable' .	1.2741169899947418
History has taught us that Fascists start to blow hot and cold: using heated words first, in populist, xenophobic speeches, and then cool words in order to make themselves acceptable to institutions and to infiltrate them gradually, poisoning them, until the day they start to take action.	1.228938080620679
And when that day comes, it is too late.	1.1885508975860775
So our Treaty has made provision for barriers for the time when it is too late, but we are not at that point: today we have to take steps to ensure that we do not get to that point.	1.4919576270975463
We must therefore find a political solution.	1.0785563483197362
I support the Council proposals in this, while deploring a certain lack of strength, a certain spinelessness, on the part of the Commission which will, however, have to be vigilant on a day-by-day basis, with determination over time, since Fascists count on the spinelessness of democracy, they count on time to wear us down and they hope to impose their views in the end.	1.4349131573314915
Our response must be rapid.	0.4316066278763775
If today we do not staunchly support the Council, then history will judge us, saying that we achieved the political equivalent of the Munich Agreement.	1.28696622113957
Madam President, I am pleased about the fact that, in Austria, the will of the large majority of the people is being respected and that this formation of government constitutes, in my eyes, a huge victory for democracy.	1.5445005111711847
Let there be no doubt about it: we decline with thanks a Europe which develops into a kind of "big brother" and which keeps watch over left-wing political correctness in one Member State or another in a Stalinist way and using Stalinist methods.	1.1213951279207584
European democracy and Austrian democracy should not receive any lessons from anybody and certainly not from a Belgian Government that embraces corrupt parties financed by arms dealers and that appointed the leader of such a corrupt party, which was condemned by the court, to the post of European Commissioner.	1.2462029263445114
Today, we thank the Austrian people for this democratic triumph which is important to all nations within Europe and to anyone who feels particularly strongly about freedom and freedom of speech.	1.398819211762762
Madam President, this debate was opened by Mr Da Costa, who merely confirms that the EU presidency is trying to influence the composition of a government of one of the Member States.	1.4012505408403977
This debate, and the background to it, reinforced the point that the Council, the Commission and this Parliament itself are dominated by Socialists.	1.5086586915135574
My delegation of 37 Conservative and Unionist Members from the United Kingdom reject absolutely the underlying philosophy, programme and tone of Austria' s Freedom Party.	0.9028822460487472
We share the widespread outrage at its attitude to history, in particular World War II, but also its policies on enlargement, on immigration, on race and its attitude to the European Union itself.	1.5577700584143888
We were also outraged, however, at the tolerance of the left for the tyranny, the terror and the excesses of the former USSR.	1.3633326600641762
Even today, surely it is high time for the Party of European Socialists to break their fraternal links with China' s Communist Party.	1.0308208709989386
Not a word was said by these same EU governments about coalition governments involving fellow-travelling communists in French or Italian governments, or in German state governments, or even the British government' s willingness to promote those with terrorist associations as ministers in Northern Ireland today.	1.1088768242081266
This, Madam President, is the hypocrisy of the left.	1.4086344123982595
So we condemn that hypocrisy and the double standards, especially of the British government and the other largely socialist heads of EU governments and include that of the United States.	1.2722647538646423
We should recognise, however, that the democratic process sometimes produces uncomfortable results.	1.1735976567648656
This requires action to address the underlying causes, including an examination of the electoral process itself.	1.1206059644304731
That should be our task, not political posturing.	1.2855788672800508
Madam President, Representative of the Council, Commissioner, a week ago, the big international Holocaust Conference ended in Stockholm.	1.4470049272246965
Its aim was to combat the forgetfulness and the evil in today' s society which takes the form of xenophobia and neo-nazism.	0.999151510190782
It would be an insult to the idea behind this conference and to the whole of the international community to invite, at this time, into the institutions of the EU, a xenophobic party which flirts with Nazi ideas.	1.5185726439481815
Secondly, I want to say that we must be consistent in our own behaviour and in our evaluations.	1.5376266690387108
We demand of the candidate States and of the countries with which the EU cooperates under the Lomé Agreement that they should respect human rights and show tolerance towards their neighbours.	1.3232810597196043
We must do the same as far as we ourselves are concerned.	1.424583441077033
That is why we are reacting against this carry-on in Austria.	1.0443593960823276
It is not acceptable to continue as if nothing had happened.	1.343047509399985
We are at a watershed in the history of the European Union.	0.8955760767987724
The Union is not only an economic community but also a community of values, something which we take seriously. Something has happened.	1.3407706026435737
The European Union is in the process of finding its soul and getting some steel in its spine.	1.2757973575279193
Madam President, as everyone has said, this is a very important day. It is the day of the first debate of European political life.	1.6085878427681275
And this is not pure chance.	1.3521114515601176
I feel that today' s meeting is not a meeting of Europe, our institutions, with Austria or Mr Haider' s party.	1.4737770693280345
It is the meeting of Europe with itself, with its raison d' être, with the reasons why we are here in this Chamber.	1.6177832339917477
This Chamber was not made for goods, it was not made for money.	1.2002668549038296
This Chamber, and the European institutions, were build to uphold values, morality and a certain spirit.	1.376801740964101
In the twentieth century, we have had experience of the fact that democracies can find themselves at risk, and morality, values and the spirit which I mentioned can be mortally affected by viruses which have just one name: nationalist glorification, populism and the concept of racial superiority.	1.210880366108105
The fact is that it is enough to read the manifesto of Mr Haider' s party, the FPÖ, to find nationalist glorification, populism and racial superiority in every chapter.	1.1789389183687402
Reading only one sentence which my friend, Mr Vidal-Quadras, has previously mentioned, "The nation is defined by its location, culture and race, locally, ethnically and culturally."	1.1503650080391394
Well, we cannot accept such statements.	1.4331848863964676
If Europe has any meaning, and - my friends will pardon me telling them - if Christian democracy has any meaning, if the history of Christian democracy has any meaning, then it must declare itself radically opposed to the statements made in this manifesto and, whatever excellent reasons are given whenever history serves the same dish up again, must reject any agreement with this type of ideology and this type of organisation.	1.2046461004046014
This is the reason why I feel that the European Parliament, which has more freedom of action and more freedom to speak than the Council or the Commission, must pay tribute to those people in the various States and European institutions who had the courage to say no, and it must say, Madam President, that you made a statement on our behalf which does us credit, and in clear terms declare, without prevarication, its opposition to and condemnation of imminent events in Austria, recalling the statement made on the day of the Munich Agreement by a great French Christian Democrat who said that, if you are going to have to say no, then the best time to do so is right at the beginning.	1.5114762404034394
(Applause)	-0.0
Madam President, we the Belgian Christian Democrats are concerned as, fortunately, are a great many other Members too.	1.424440012658916
The coalition which is being created in one of the Member States is clearly an Austrian affair but undoubtedly has a European dimension too.	1.2679131766810503
Because what is it that unites us in Europe? Surely it is the values and principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights, more than anything.	1.2415397120478562
The Austrian Freedom Party leader, Mr Haider, has repeatedly repudiated these values.	1.2391350075407912
He also repudiates the basic forms of diplomatic politeness.	0.6894291009329236
He is a dangerous man.	1.0025935394914225
The Christian Democratic parties in my country have made up their minds a long time ago and they stick to their decision to listen to the protests of extreme-right voters but never to negotiate with extreme-right leaders.	1.1096118530977581
Values should take precedence over power.	0.4949654827546303
We deplore, therefore, what is happening in Austria.	1.0000964835549957
In fact, we were shaken by it.	1.4165551143043067
We are extremely disappointed.	0.7528540116363779
As a last resort, we would ask the ÖVP to look into alternatives.	1.3592145076053792
We keep reminding them about Article 6 of the Treaty.	0.6500061492160735
We continue to fight against the trivialisation of the extreme right.	0.80757574893752
If, despite this, the coalition goes ahead, we would urge the ÖVP party members to ensure that the principles and values which underlie European integration are observed in political programmes, both in word and deed.	1.4791811756813706
Madam President, Austria awaits a heavy responsibility.	1.3540524236233
Madam President, it is clear that we in this Parliament are very largely agreed on rejecting Mr Haider and his politics, but it is equally clear that opinion differs as to the most effective way of opposing this brand of politics.	1.3865282470254299
Have you stopped to ask what kind of effect the debate we are having here and the statement delivered by the Council Presidency last weekend are having in Austria itself?	1.2680066123604212
Have you stopped to ask whether or not we will also be responsible for the way in which the political situation unfolds from now if we set ourselves up to pass judgement on it here?	1.127781782199803
Have you stopped to ask what would happen if the wish of a certain fellow MEP was to be fulfilled and elections were to be held in Austria in the course of the next few days?	1.1513550510611783
From all accounts, this would only serve to strengthen Haider.	1.1419621073063877
Who would want this to happen?	0.832988174019766
Is it not our responsibility to give thought to how we should tackle this brand of politics?	1.0073605029886223
Europe is a community of law.	1.1786506639177154
Democracy, respect for human rights and rule of law are amongst the principles that we must uphold.	1.0745334226459102
One of the precepts of democracy is that we should not disapprove of electoral outcomes but respect them, and that is why we must respect the fact that the Austrians, by virtue of their political culture, voted as they did.	1.389586872380989
It is for reasons of constitutionality that the President-in-Office of the Council ought not to have made the statement he did, and in a manner that goes against the Treaty.	1.3342606871327953
It would be politically astute not to isolate the ÖVP but to support it as an undeniably democratic, constitutional and well-known European party, so as to be equally certain that Austria will continue to be a Member of this European Community, and that is why we must give the ÖVP our support in this difficult situation, and isolation would be altogether the wrong line to take!	1.3669671074953011
(Applause)	-0.0
Madam President, they say, where I come from, 'it' s three times for a Welshman' , and three times, as I think you will discover in the course of that debate, I signified my desire to respond very briefly to what has been an excellent, and on several occasions, a moving debate.	1.534117683861073
First of all, could I express my thanks on behalf of President Prodi and my colleagues in the Commission for the support and understanding offered by several Members of the House to the position taken by the Commission in the statement that we made yesterday.	1.4374324498828956
I must respond also to the fact, of course, that there were references during the debate - and I use some of the words employed - to the ambiguity, the complacency and the fragility of the Commission' s opinion.	1.6051431992873237
I am duty- bound to say to this House, there is no ambiguity or fragility or complacency in the opinion offered, or indeed the action taken, by the Commission on this issue.	1.5324012362826467
We made explicit reference yesterday morning in our statement, as did the President this afternoon, to the fact that we share the concern demonstrated by fourteen Member States in their statement on Monday.	1.477252309683206
Secondly, we said, in very specific terms, that we will work closely with all Member States in examining the situation as it develops in Austria.	1.5721330744524218
Thirdly, we expressed, in very explicit terms, that we will uphold without fear or favour the values and the provisions of Article 6 of the Treaty; and that we will take our part under Article 7 of the Treaty in ensuring that those values of liberty and democracy and fundamental freedoms are upheld.	1.5347484192576226
There is no complacency, no fragility and no ambiguity about any of that at all.	1.2559790020748447
And, when I say that the Commission took that view, I include my dear colleague Franz Fischler, who is from Austria; and who, once again, demonstrated his integrity and his independence as a Member of the European Commission, under oath, in being part of that statement that we made yesterday morning.	1.4106368071046684
Anyone, therefore, who invites Franz Fischler to his house to somehow account for the fact that his nationality is Austrian, should examine their own motives in the context of a debate, which has been necessarily shadowed by references to xenophobia and even more lethal evils in this world.	1.188963570325938
I say that in friendship and honour to my friend and colleague, Franz Fischler.	1.1204587848070577
Could I also say, Madam President, that the understanding of the presidency, the Portuguese presidency, for our position, was absolutely demonstrated in the clearest terms by Mr Da Costa when he said, and I quote him, that 'Portugal and the other Member States want to ensure that the working of the Community machine is not affected by the current situation' .	1.5436267400024535
That surely is in everyone' s interests.	0.752041451836222
In order to ensure that the Treaty is upheld and that we sustain what was described as the Community machine, we are following the course of action which was set down in our statement yesterday.	1.5030236294953714
We will continue to do that, Madam President, without fear or favour.	1.3426702941098692
That is our duty.	0.9985480973750598
It is also a matter of conviction.	1.163929886616423
My final point is this.	0.6485164568735864
We understand the context of this essential debate.	1.1343589973659658
There are several people here who like myself for many years past have become familiar with Herr Haider' s offensive statements, the xenophobia of many of his policy elements and the strategy that he has developed of alternating aggressive statements with apologies, sometimes on successive days.	1.1531097775478587
We understand that, and we recall too the sometimes short and selective memory that he has of Nazism.	1.3335066075063575
And, when we recall that, like many others on all sides of this House, my and my colleagues' instincts are naturally aroused.	1.5607821457624569
However, the Commission has to act on the basis of values and law and not only on the basis of instinct.	1.6088708826237328
And that is why we came to the conclusion we reached yesterday morning.	1.2347872300740022
That is why we sustain that conclusion as we continue to uphold the values and the law. Without fragility, without complacency, without ambiguity, but in the service of the whole Union and every Member State of the Union and its people.	1.5655616086444721
We will continue to do that with energy and with consistency and as Mr Cox said in the debate, 'necessarily with acute vigilance' .	1.153499155155973
I wonder, since Mr Da Costa has been listening to these remarks from the back of the Chamber, whether Mr Kinnock could confirm that the Commission supports the view explicitly stated by Mr Da Costa today and in the recent statement by the Presidency on behalf of the heads of government.	1.3936975230522388
Does the Commission support the Council?	0.98307480823696
Madam President, when the Commission said yesterday morning that it notes the views expressed as a joint statement by fourteen Member States and shares the concern that gave rise to that view, I think it can be taken for granted that since yesterday morning, as soon as the Commission could discuss the issue, it has had a view consistent with that of fourteen of the Member States.	1.5245984941232607
Thank you, Commissioner Kinnock.	0.9727683663971937
I think that we have just had a great political debate, equal to the situation and to what could be expected of it.	1.5619210337354454
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.	0.8213299124405938
The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed.	0.6476765615743313
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	0.4314254166720252
Recourse to the precautionary principle	0.11507974897914652
The next item is the Commission statement on recourse to the precautionary principle.	0.8138147679487836
I want to start by saying that I am pleased to be presenting this communication on the use of the precautionary principle, and it has been written together with David Byrne and Erkki Liikanen.	1.1979358493338472
The precautionary principle is not a new concept.	1.338842277397208
It has been used by the Community for some time now in a range of policy areas, environmental, human, animal and plant health; and it is explicitly mentioned in the environmental provisions of the EC Treaty since Maastricht.	1.2477355033027542
It also appears in a range of international texts, for example, the Rio Declaration and most recently the Bio-Safety Protocol.	0.9541891649587811
The essence of the precautionary principle is clear.	0.8110335586832003
It involves taking action in a given policy area when the science is not clear, but where there are reasonable grounds for concern that the potential risks are big enough to require action.	1.19538321998039
However, the use of the precautionary principle has been increasingly in the spotlight in recent years.	1.193808576408246
Events such as the BSE and dioxin crisis have stimulated a growing public debate about the circumstances in which precautionary action is justified and necessary.	0.989375351014693
In view of this growing interest, the Commission therefore considered that it would be useful to present a communication to set out its position on the use of the precautionary principle.	1.3807075168784908
The basic aim of the communication is twofold.	1.04734188642864
To explain in a clear and coherent way how the Commission applies, and intends to apply, the precautionary principle in its management of risk and to set out guidelines for its application based on reasoned and coherent principles.	1.174075699981233
We also hope that the communication will help to build a better common understanding of how to manage risks and to dispel fears that the precautionary principle might be used in an arbitrary way or as a disguised form of trade protectionism.	1.1421006197430505
The Commission' s starting point in applying the precautionary principle is the need to ensure a high level of protection in the fields of environmental, human, animal and plant health.	1.299251122237997
Of course, this objective cannot be used to justify irrational or arbitrary measures, but it does mean that action can still be taken even in situations where the science is unclear.	1.305953212295537
As such, while the precautionary principle does not involve the politicisation of science, as some have alleged, it does take us to the crossroads between science and politics.	1.4509342211261758
The initial decision to apply the precautionary principle depends largely on the level of protection sought and the level of risk that decision-makers are prepared to accept for society.	1.052505093569497
It is therefore political by nature.	1.1391901703343517
However, the measures that may subsequently be taken must obviously comply with the general principles applicable to risk management and the guidelines for applying the precautionary principle are therefore the key element of the paper.	1.3204491879604212
Measures taken must be proportional to the chosen level of protection - that is, we do not use the sledgehammer to crack a nut.	1.184867861822374
They must be non-discriminatory in their application, that is measures should not differentiate on the basis of geographical origin.	1.2155583320644994
And they must be consistent with similar measures already taken.	0.980456291897785
For example, if one product has been approved, similar products should also be approved.	1.3776127803919238
Measures are based on an examination of the potential benefits and costs of action or lack of action; that is, the measures should be cost-effective and subject to review in the light of new scientific data and be clear about who is responsible for producing the scientific evidence necessary for a more comprehensive risk assessment, that is the burden of proof.	1.2468301254152885
All these elements have to apply cumulatively.	0.8446386473954826
It is also important to bear in mind that there are a wide range of measures, which can be taken in applying the precautionary principle. For example, a research programme, public information campaigns, recommendations and so on.	1.429867211293755
Applying the precautionary principle does not, therefore, automatically imply a ban.	0.8748773372685699
This communication does not pretend to be the final word on this issue; however, it is the first time that the Commission has presented a structured presentation of the principle and its operational use.	1.4277786572977988
By setting out in some detail how the Commission applies, and intends to apply, the precautionary principle, we hope to be able to clarify the situation at Community level and to contribute to the ongoing debate at European and international level.	1.2379181474407954
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for your statement.	0.9388409189170609
I have three short questions, the first being as follows.	1.298584960783302
We have been awaiting a common communication from the Commission on the precautionary principle for a very long time now and it was anything but clear in the past as to whether the Commission speaks with one voice.	1.4745749005025666
Does the document you have presented here today also accord with the opinion of your colleagues the Commissioners for Industry, Foreign Trade, Competition and the Internal Market?	1.1582603537293898
I am sure that your answer to this will be "yes" but I would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentlemen are also aware as to what the consequences of this will be?	1.4299598222523275
My next question, Mrs Wallström, is when will you begin to apply this principle to legislation; to legislation pertaining to chemicals or other sectors, for example?	1.3799905755457278
Lastly, will we be able to recognise when this principle has been applied in legislation?	1.3218769847095706
In other words, will each proposal contain an additional sheet stating that checks have been made as to the application of the precautionary principle and the following conclusion has been reached?	1.184758435888432
. Thank you very much, Dagmar Roth-Behrendt, for these questions.	1.1525162689169468
Of course, this is shared by the whole Commission.	1.3511276811274329
This is a common communication which was written by the three of us, David Byrne, Erkki Liikanen and myself, but it has been passed unanimously in the Commission today.	1.377092589494046
It received strong support from the rest of the Commissioners and it has been through an interservice consultation in the whole of the Commission.	1.2059135673398773
So we have really worked through this document and I am sure that they are all able to describe the guidelines and the principles as laid down in this document.	1.2299938177364937
Yes, I would say we already use this way of working with different, difficult issues like a new chemical strategy for example.	1.4055291678055761
And, I am sure that we will also mention it explicitly when we work with this principle.	1.4900605518084602
We have just recently had a case of using the precautionary principle when it came to ban phthalates in soft PVC toys; and of course, we apply it in several different environmental areas.	1.1781450253046817
It has been mainly used in the environmental field, but, of course also when it comes to human health.	1.5438154120461702
So, we will try to be very clear about how and when to use it.	1.4082780177996606
Mr President, Commissioner, regarding the relationship between science, on the one hand, and applying the precautionary principle on the other, the communication states that invoking that precautionary principle always requires a political decision if there is a lack of scientific evidence.	1.2486521551317435
Needless to say, this accords science a great deal of power.	1.1675835697072283
We might ask ourselves, what kind of scientists will supply this documentation and what do they stand for?	1.0920968704140424
The communication also states that the precautionary principle can be applied, provided there is a sufficient recognised minority of scientists.	1.2396302385211162
I would like to ask, what is, then, the definition of a recognised minority?	1.4290589186510636
How would you describe this?	0.6531820161943473
What establishes a recognised minority?	0.3898469062651935
If a political decision is involved, I would also like to ask: who takes this political decision?	1.250541446710592
The Commission?	-0.0
The Council?	-0.0
And to what extent will the European Parliament be able to play a role in this?	1.3462127424860793
What is the role of the scientific committees?	1.1484047718068109
What, also, will be the role of the food authorities which you are about to set up?	1.4433699938859272
Finally, will this whole decision-making process be carried out in a transparent, public way?	1.6355168228549168
These are my three questions.	0.5443193156493961
. Yes, Mr President, that is true.	1.4632910626360496
There were many and difficult issues and not always crystal clear, but I will try to answer some questions.	1.1679300664219154
Who will take the decision, who are the decision-makers?	1.586590181835238
Well, that depends on who the legislators are.	1.2005765629253948
This is part of risk management.	0.5775602538086344
They have to look at, for example, the concerns of people in relation to a special issue, and they have to judge from what is known about the scientific evidence in a certain case.	1.455321803593712
However, it is true that it does not need a big majority of the scientific community to be able to use the precautionary principle.	1.3472569976781672
It can be used on evidence from a minority or where science is incomplete.	1.0116817630115125
That is, of course, where you strike a balance between this principle as a political tool and science.	1.180086913349884
It is not always easy to describe exactly how this process is done, but there is no question of changing the scientific base.	1.3402114877739426
We use the experts to get as much scientific information and facts as possible before we take a decision; and that should also be done in the future.	1.3180467251906038
You have to see this as a tool for risk management.	1.4248786696064768
You have to decide whether you want to put people in danger, for example, or if you want to protect the environment; and you have to look at the science that is available.	1.416594549904392
You have to assess all that and evaluate the science.	1.030258070342905
Then you decide to take a measure or not, to take action or not.	1.42139012212688
So, there is no answer to all your questions but this does not change the system of the scientists that we use today or the system of experts that we use today.	1.2829484033507672
Mr President, I have a question concerning an actual, concrete case in which it should be possible to apply the precautionary principle.	1.3499887985428274
It is about brominated flame retardants.	0.8784470514317518
It is a fact that these substances are now being discovered. There are increased concentrations of them in both people and the environment.	1.3623676210926123
There are many people who maintain that they entail major risks, while others question how large the risks involved in these substances really are.	1.1673264668762517
Recently, both Sweden and Denmark urged the Commission in the Council of Ministers to take the initiative and ban brominated flame retardants.	1.3513928156326755
I am wondering, therefore, if you are preparing such a ban and if it would not fit in very well with your approach to the precautionary principle itself to come up with such an initiative.	1.248907891248337
. (SV) Mr President, thank you very much, Mr Sjöstedt, for this question.	1.197946969916711
The issue of brominated flame retardants is an important one.	0.7836812459546139
It was raised quite recently in the Environment Council by a number of ministers who want the Commission to look at what basis there might be for a ban and at what might need to be done.	1.2962934320282766
We are in the process of looking into this question and assessing what knowledge we have today and what it is possible to do.	1.2140931313925025
Allow me to remind you, however, that use of the precautionary principle does not need to be synonymous with there being a total ban.	1.2376136553759183
There may be a series of different measures which can be taken.	1.0279044176392078
It ought not, therefore, to be immediately interpreted as a ban.	1.245104923064567
Where brominated flame retardants are concerned, there may eventually be a ban, but it is important to say that the precautionary principle permits the whole spectrum of political measures and initiatives to be taken.	1.262932662041218
This issue is extremely topical.	0.8791588161215493
The Commission is to do its job and give proper attention to the issue before we come back with an assessment of what needs to be done.	1.295855731162132
You said that the precautionary principle should not be used as a disguised trade barrier.	1.1127236658162896
Is the understanding of this point the same on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean?	1.144677255864485
I think we are going to have problems particularly with hormone-treated beef and genetically modified crops.	1.0703011397126416
Will the Americans take the same view of this point as we do?	1.2863576251543842
. (SV) Mr President, I am pleased to be able to tell you that, in Montreal, we have just signed a protocol concerning bio-safety.	1.187012021693737
We succeeded there in agreeing, at an international forum, as to the definition of the precautionary principle.	1.420902550501834
I consider it to be a breakthrough that we succeeded in concluding this protocol.	0.9806035411648196
I believe it will set the trend for future discussions concerning the precautionary principle.	1.031831230443478
We are going to be able to use this as an example of how the precautionary principle is to be interpreted.	1.4887330795385763
It is, moreover, also accepted as an important and effective tool.	1.327843750001425
Mr President, I have two questions. I shall try to be very brief indeed.	1.4620412107816474
The first question concerns the implementation of the precautionary principle.	0.7638416409455661
As I have understood it, there has been a certain lack of clarity in some respects as to how this is to be understood.	1.4695357621639658
Is it the case that a risk assessment is firstly to be carried out, including a cost-benefit analysis?	1.1187587403302734
In that case, I am rather concerned, because the idea was really that a cost-benefit analysis should not be used as a tool for deciding whether the precautionary principle should be introduced. Instead, the precautionary principle should come first.	1.4091804443012799
My second question concerns the burden of proof.	0.5066941858278118
I remember Margot Wallström being introduced as Commissioner in the Committee.	0.8540961908668554
At that time, she was talking about the desire for a reversed burden of proof.	0.8783792018560876
In other words, a product' s manufacturer is to demonstrate whether or not the product is hazardous.	1.226932318640308
I want to know whether this also applies in the document which the Commission has presented now.	1.619518146994759
. (SV) Thank you, Mrs Schörling.	1.337808836584585
These are two important questions, and it is good that I should be given the opportunity to clarify them.	1.2594743684727878
No, one must not begin by carrying out a cost-benefit analysis. Instead, the latter should be based upon an assessment of what it is we know, of what science has to tell us and of how we should view the product concerned in the light of the risks we judge there to exist for the environment or for the health of human beings or animals.	1.4007676674113287
When, on the other hand, the decision has been made to take a certain measure, the one chosen ought to be cost-effective so that there is in fact no resort to measures which are wholly unreasonable given their degree of effectiveness.	1.3284851096434571
It is not, therefore, the case that one must begin with a cost-benefit analysis.	1.212844754436761
The second question concerns the reversed burden of proof.	0.4781766609446745
It is perfectly correct that we need to apply this in certain cases.	1.186443014508145
I have used chemical strategy as a good example of an area in which we need to do this.	1.1669820068783074
There, however, we are concerned with that particular area, whereas it may be said that the present communication concerning the precautionary principle is horizontal in the sense that it concerns the full range of specific technical areas that are of political concern.	1.4010398616508069
Therefore, the issues of the reversed burden of proof and of what the burden of proof is to look like are not especially discussed in this context. Instead, it is a question of political decision-making and of the bases for this.	1.3531847929853908
It is, however, perfectly correct that, when it comes, for example, to chemicals, we must ensure that we obtain a reversed burden of proof.	1.3681070304186562
Mr President, I believe that the precautionary principle needs to be quite radical in order to work, otherwise we shall always be confused by all the different interpretations possible.	1.268253131848859
I will give an example: a fungicide has been proven to cause babies to be born blind. It is therefore a teratogenic substance.	1.2647370854098217
Very well, it is a fungicide, it kills off mould.	1.4795276042434191
This teratogenicity has been demonstrated by just one English laboratory, perhaps because it is the only one that has carried out tests.	1.343043437066967
Now, in my opinion, given that this is such a serious risk to health, the precautionary principle lays down that this product should immediately be taken off the market, which New Zealand has done, for example.	1.2974796002214488
So I want to put this question to you. When human health is at stake, or there is the possibility that human health will be seriously affected, should we not perhaps carry out a cost-benefit analysis?	1.4575777601176463
The cost of a baby being born blind is too high; there are no benefits that can compensate for this.	1.2166511274377114
In short, Commissioner, I would therefore like to know whether in this case, the precautionary principle as you understand it, would in any case, require the product to be taken off the market, until such time as another laboratory provides evidence to the contrary.	1.3130825384496505
. (SV) Mr President, no one wants more than I do to see a situation in which we are able to apply the precautionary principle in such a way that it is seen as radically protecting people' s health and the environment.	1.2619031008524744
Obviously, I cannot adopt a stance on this special case and on the particular product which has been mentioned here, but I shall go directly back and see what I can obtain in the way of information about this particular case.	1.4326668488912093
The truth, of course, is that a great many Member States, and no doubt other nations too, have taken measures to protect their populations' health which amount to using the precautionary principle, even if it has not always been called that.	1.436218729928983
Naturally, it is not in the first place a question of cost; there can in fact be an enormous cost to society if the decision to take a particular measure is avoided.	1.6144173607821277
Nor must it be a case of sitting and calculating the value of a human life over and against the cost of taking a particular measure.	1.0407059975900563
I think, however, it is quite obvious that when it is eventually time to decide upon a particular step to be taken, it is often the case that there are many different courses of action to choose between.	1.4151440053777726
In those circumstances, consideration should be given to what is likely to produce the best result.	1.1697522356492893
I cannot forbear telling you about an occasion when the expression cost-effective was used by people whom one cannot perhaps imagine using it, namely when I was on a visit to Africa.	1.0896897255911084
At a hospice for AIDS patients, I met two Irish Catholic nuns who were caring for dying AIDS patients.	0.9873632189921279
They were the first to say that, each day, they must think about doing what is most cost-effective because resources had to suffice for their poor patients there. We must be very careful about how we use resources.	1.383301814375927
I believe we can learn something from this.	1.1602930307985944
We must, of course, always ensure that we use our resources in the most effective manner and in such a way that they provide the broadest possible help.	1.27483423235625
As is also explained in the present communication, it is not therefore correct that one must first begin with some sort of cost-benefit analysis.	1.2321404186613443
Consideration should be given to what science is offering in the way of knowledge, and this should be used as an important political tool for protecting the environment and people' s health.	1.3930543335397192
Mr President, it is a rare honour to be given a second opportunity to ask questions!	1.529916166542788
Commissioner, I would like to come back again to my first question, when I asked about the other Commissioners, for it may have sounded as though I was in jest.	1.5628373091520649
Indeed you responded in kind, as I knew you would do.	1.2637371730183438
I would like to draw your attention to something Mr Goodwill asked, that is to the connections we make between the precautionary principle and the world beyond the European Union.	1.2851938328553982
I have good reason for asking this.	0.7172474080364516
As you rightly said, the precautionary principle is needed in precisely those areas where, as yet, there is no scientific evidence.	1.4017036246439774
How can we ensure that we will not be laying ourselves open to attack at any time, for example by our partners in the USA, on account of the bio safety protocol not being adequate to their purposes?	1.3553303428513261
How can we be sure that those of your colleagues responsible for industrial policy and foreign trade policy, will not, as they did on the last few occasions with your predecessors, keep pulling the carpet from underneath you?	1.4559441896144478
That is exactly what it is all about, otherwise we might as well not bother talking about the precautionary principle here, Commissioner!	1.294866535156687
Mr President, I think it is extremely important to point to the present communication' s guidelines for using the precautionary principle as a way of repudiating assertions to the effect that we always want to use the principle for protectionist reasons.	1.3170902614434934
I am certain that we are going to have more conflicts, for example with the United States.	1.3396381719042847
We should not be so naïve as to think otherwise.	1.079785998878934
Ever since we signed this protocol in Montreal, we nonetheless have international recognition and a common definition written into a protocol dealing with the environment, health and trade.	1.188125480523438
This constitutes a good example, therefore.	1.7486585229370606
We should be in no doubt that conflicts may arise in the future too, but we can now show that we do not use the precautionary principle arbitrarily.	1.4922088843764971
We now have a number of guidelines for using the precautionary principle, and we have increased support among our respective peoples for using it, something which is clearly established in the present communication.	1.160798905195939
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6737777542510281
The focus on the political precautionary principle means that we have being discussing it for almost two hours and this topic is now being viewed, so to speak, as more than an ordinary aspect of administration, even though, as we have been able to establish from the interventions, questions and replies, it is a topic which we believe to be of considerable importance.	1.3214252993608464
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
Intergovernmental Conference	-0.0
The next item is the report (A5-0018/2000) by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference [14094/1999 - C5-0341/1999 - 1999/0825(CNS)].	0.7781961818927152
Mr President, I will begin by thanking the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission for all our recent very useful contacts.	1.5135234968369302
Let me also once more thank my co-rapporteur Mr Leinen for our excellent collaboration.	0.9584782101878712
The Intergovernmental Conference that is about to begin is important, both in a general sense and more particularly in view of the imminent enlargement.	1.2864691385354174
The work of the Conference will determine the structure and method based on which Europe will be functioning in the twentieth century.	1.069475331414435
For the European Union of the future to be able to function more effectively, more democratically and with complete transparency, clearly what we need is an extensive and in-depth reform of the institutions and the way they work.	1.5030113657997817
The first and substantive prerequisite for achieving that reform is the agenda based on which the Intergovernmental Conference is to begin its work.	1.2751322738409214
From the decisions made at the Helsinki Summit, it emerges that the agenda agreed there is unsatisfactory and does not guarantee the essential and substantive changes required for creating a more functional Europe, one that is more effective, more democratic and more transparent.	1.3015331879328378
This is because the Helsinki agenda is limited to consideration only of the three issues that relate in a fragmentary way to the structure and operation of just two of the European Union' s institutional bodies.	1.2251428641464592
I will not repeat which ones, because everyone knows.	1.2983428377533217
My conclusion is justified on the one hand by the constant and sometimes very insistent demands of the peoples of Europe and on the other hand by the huge scale of the great enterprise in which the European Union is already involved, namely enlargement.	1.4422424182300468
Granted this, the new Intergovernmental Conference must not fail to include in its agenda issues which, properly addressed, would ensure the correct operation of all and not just some of the European Union' s institutions.	1.40907332783149
Just as it also must not fail to include everyday issues which, for that very reason, are highly visible to the European public.	1.3860399475350318
In its numerous debates and its reports so far the European Parliament has openly supported the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.073416072090862
At the same time, however, I am asking for it to include issues that improve and complement the reform, I repeat, of all the institutional bodies as well as issues that are of direct concern and interest to the European public such as health, energy, culture, transport and even tourism.	1.3644940579945717
Whether or not the agenda will ultimately be widened is still the subject of debate and on this point I would like to extol the political conduct of the Portuguese Presidency, which has repeatedly made a commitment to the European Parliament to make the necessary efforts towards that end.	1.4433131646915005
All the same, whether or not more issues will be considered must in no way diminish the importance attributed by every Member State to the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.0890433365682612
This is because the institutional framework within which Europe will operate in the future is a foundation of European integration and is therefore a matter of the greatest national importance for every one of the Union' s Member States.	1.4145296003272476
In light of what I have said, I ask Parliament to approve the opinion which Mr Leinen and I have put before you, so that on 14 February, the work of the Intergovernmental Conference can begin and our two representatives, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, can proceed with the difficult task that awaits them with the European Parliament' s backing.	1.3905575048177339
The same applies to the Commission and I would again like to thank Commissioner Barnier for his collaboration with the European Parliament and for the very constructive proposals he put before us.	1.5059574574270045
Mr President, the Group of the European People' s Party was not satisfied with the conclusions of the European Council in Helsinki.	1.2440029118654654
It seemed to us that the agenda lacked content, because our group was thinking in terms of the Treaty and, specifically, the protocol on the Union' s institutions.	1.4200139405976198
In Helsinki, the governments approved the idea that, as long as the European Union consists of fewer than 21 States, a minimal reform would be sufficient. With more than 21, a deeper reform would become necessary.	1.4760253236714378
The European Council in Helsinki itself approved enlargement involving 13 new Member States.	0.853788174979826
It is therefore inconsistent to open accession negotiations with 13 countries while contemplating a minimal reform.	1.0172471510511398
We are therefore thinking in terms of the Treaty and we want the agenda of the next Intergovernmental Conference to allow for a deeper reform of the Union.	1.6305504158870563
Having said this, Mr President, this Parliament is holding this debate today because we did not want to delay the start of the Conference.	1.3749120493851728
In theory, we could have done so.	1.1691730337105575
We could have voted on the 17th of this month and the Conference would not have been able to start on the 14th.	1.1856257219584763
However, we did not want to do this because we wish to send a clear political signal to the governments and the candidate countries that we want this reform to take place, precisely in order to facilitate enlargement.	1.4194609818105575
Mr President, I am very happy to be able to say this to the Portuguese Presidency because it has earned great respect in this Assembly.	1.26590743357236
The Portuguese Presidency shares many of this Parliament' s aspirations and has committed itself to doing everything it can to ensure that the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference is widened to include other essential issues.	1.1176323492720537
Mr President, I would like to point out that this aspiration on the part of the European Parliament is not an aspiration to gain benefits for the European Parliament itself.	1.3583025763924852
However, the European Parliament will be reinforced politically by the Treaty resulting from this Intergovernmental Conference. This is for one very simple reason: according to the agreements made in Helsinki, this Intergovernmental Conference will lead to issues, which are currently decided unanimously, being decided by a qualified majority.	1.4912618980361034
Therefore, the number of issues decided by a qualified majority will increase.	1.0848935619177966
It is already established within the Community acquis that those legislative issues which are decided by a qualified majority are also subject to codecision with Parliament.	1.0276603683284864
Therefore, since the qualified majority will be extended, there will also be more codecision with Parliament.	1.3602370583036651
However, this Parliament would not be fulfilling its role as a supranational European institution if it did not consider the political design of the Union.	1.2556870914065654
That it is what we are doing.	1.050953928017367
We believe that, in the political design of the Union, other issues need to be dealt with.	1.3294435112885916
These include, amongst others, the incorporation into the Treaty of security and defence issues, which have made much progress recently, but which must be incorporated into the Treaty.	1.6492243531914896
Of course there is also the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and work began on its wording yesterday, which I believe has started very positively.	1.3717295790106618
We are going to work seriously to ensure that the Europeans come to see being European as an advantage and that European citizens have certain fundamental rights which are connected to the Union' s institutions.	1.2123571770436943
Therefore, Mr President, our proposals, which we will specify in another report, together with the proposals of the Commission, which has produced an excellent document - and I am happy to be able to say this here to Mr Barnier - are going to be used as conference documents.	1.5923148360811166
We will talk about this on another day.	0.806863930215617
Today we must give the green light to this conference, and, for its part, the Group of the European People' s Party, Mr President, is ready to give that green light.	1.2101982397995876
Mr President, for the Socialist Group I can say we will be supporting the draft opinion put forward by the rapporteurs on behalf of the Constitutional Affairs Committee.	1.7256453344297302
We are giving a positive opinion on the convening of the IGC precisely because we have been impressed by the attitude of the Portuguese Presidency which has taken on board our request that the agenda of the IGC be widened.	1.23773731455664
The Amsterdam leftovers is not a very good term, because they are very important subjects in themselves.	1.3861799992076747
Let us call them the first three subjects of the IGC.	1.0409579930808674
These first three subjects are very important but they are subjects which were explored in detail by our Member States during the last IGC.	1.094345295148388
They did not quite reach a conclusion on them but they certainly do not need nine months of further study.	1.0851787770064418
They need a political deal.	0.7973561365070597
It is more a question of nine minutes, perhaps nine hours if it is difficult, locked away together in a room to reach a solution on these subjects, not nine months.	1.2136939247537133
In those circumstances it would be silly not to widen the agenda.	1.0493710364018716
There are other issues that should fruitfully be looked at, especially before such a large widening of the Union to so many new countries.	1.3609954745766055
Nobody is asking for a Christmas tree.	0.6392128868062994
Nobody is asking for an IGC of the Maastricht style with a hundred or more subjects being debated.	0.8658155731461442
However, there are six, seven, eight, nine perhaps, subjects which it would be very appropriate and useful to address.	1.3762658958738014
There is time.	0.3416840634477862
Remember the IGC that led to the Single European Act.	0.9863272306067558
It lasted only five months.	0.49993044181052965
The IGC that led to the enormous Maastricht Treaty lasted a year.	0.7306438539034126
Only the Amsterdam Treaty lasted a year and a half and that was because everyone knew you had to wait for the results of the British election if you were going to have any outcome from that IGC so that was a different reason.	1.2550294213738664
A year is ample time to address a large number of issues and it should certainly be enough to address the few crucial points that we wish to be added to the agenda.	1.138837529141862
I am pleased to see that the Commission shares our view.	1.1625255019478613
The Commission has just published its opinion and it has done exactly what Parliament asked of it - to bring forward a comprehensive proposal complete with actual draft treaty articles.	1.3805225263284944
I thank the Commission for doing that even if, of course, I do not agree with everything the Commission said.	1.3148225320229756
I think there are some gaps in what they have put forward.	1.0636380943454842
Nonetheless the Commission has provided a service and I pay tribute to Commissioner Barnier who is here with us today for doing that.	1.1712396313499023
They have laid out for the public to see some of the crucial issues that we are going to have to address in this IGC.	1.2409003495546478
That is all to the good.	1.0684362233837577
The Parliament, the Council presidency and the Commission are pulling in the same direction for a wider agenda.	1.6583220216037413
I wish you every success, President of the Council, in making sure that the European Council agrees to this agenda and that on Valentine' s Day when you start off the IGC it will be under good auspices and you will bring it to a good conclusion, also when the French Presidency takes over, by the end of this year.	1.3986766554699235
We should no longer be worried that the agenda for the IGC will be restricted.	1.024709614685948
That is one of the political conclusions that we must draw from the grave decision of 14 Member States yesterday virtually to freeze relations with a partner.	1.1609443241225021
It makes it impossible for those same Member States, at the IGC, to fail to give operational meaning to the protection and advancement of fundamental rights.	1.2908739269171168
It is already strange within the convention that is drafting the charter to see representatives of some Member States, especially Britain and France, seeking to argue that a mandatory charter would somehow be an infringement of national sovereignty.	1.136167118934347
It is vital that the IGC prepares the way to accept the installation of a fundamental rights regime within the Treaty.	1.193797283560379
One part of this is to improve the access of the citizen to the Court.	1.4294217503295028
Another is for the Union itself to sign up to the European Convention.	1.506244983032009
Another is clearly for national parliaments and national political parties to find a reinforced role that they can play inside European Union affairs and to share the shouldering of responsibility to build European parliamentary democracy.	1.1563149453906907
My group strongly welcomes the IGC and will be contributing to this Treaty reform process to the maximum possible extent.	0.9674078630117668
Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance believes that the European Parliament' s decision to rush headlong into giving its opinion on the Intergovernmental Conference undermines the political significance of the request for talks with the Council, and in the end, makes it rather irrelevant.	1.2074867135891183
We would have preferred to have had greater clarification of the agenda and more guarantees on the method before giving our opinion, and frankly, we did not appreciate the discourtesy the Portuguese Presidency showed towards the European Parliament by scheduling the start of the Intergovernmental Conference for Saint Valentine' s day, the first day of the Strasbourg part-session.	1.2991856092141416
Moreover, given that this opinion is quite important, we can still vote for it, and indeed, the majority of our group will be voting for it.	1.765763371415679
I nevertheless wish to stress the fact that it is quite distressing to see the lack of real interest in this reform.	1.347713403657761
The events in Austria make it crystal clear that we need a body or structure for democracy in Europe and we need to establish principles which provide bases all the Member States.	1.2210959842811018
It is also distressing to think that the initiative taken against Austria is actually the result of an agreement between governments and that, in any case, the European Union and its institutions would not have had the means or the consensus to allow them to act, and to prevent and rectify the course of events.	1.4949039868296865
We must take action on this at the Intergovernmental Conference, and I firmly hope that this opinion, that was given reluctantly, will not mean that the European Parliament ceases to exert pressure on the Council and the Member States to make sure that this Intergovernmental Conference is not merely a technical exercise, but rouses the passions that we saw a few hours ago in Parliament.	1.5896288856695735
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, to my mind, it cannot be said often or loud enough that what the Council has adopted in the way of an agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference is completely unacceptable politically and I would add that I consider it to be nothing short of disgraceful.	1.2684893265625758
After all, we find ourselves in a situation of historic importance, that is to say, we are negotiating or are on the point of taking up negotiations with 12 States, and together we have reached a stage at which closer European integration may be a reality in the not too distant future.	1.2783320450114863
How, though, is the Union to be enlarged if we do not do the job properly now, i.e. before enlargement takes place?	1.3601796187025708
That is why we as a group are in favour of the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.3211284099745377
We consider it to be indispensable and urgently needed and hope that it actually comes up with the goods that will enable us to carry out enlargement of the European Union in the not too distant future.	1.0469993999114384
My group, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, noted with satisfaction that the Council Presidency is far from happy with the current state of affairs.	1.0136807170939484
You can therefore rest assured that the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is committed to seeing that the Union gets on with the tasks in hand.	0.9518923813400056
What we are talking about is nothing more and nothing less than the future of Europe, and, in particular, a Europe that the citizens truly regard as being theirs, because they are instrumental in shaping it and because the cares and concerns, the problems and issues they face on a daily basis are also taken seriously by politicians.	1.3665263980782643
The politics of closed doors and private discussions; all that must be consigned to the past once and for all.	0.9120744786795116
That is why we need transparency.	1.1500316290384407
I believe it falls to you, as President-in-Office of the Council, to see to it that the train does not keep rolling on as before, leaving the people behind on the platforms as if they were ignorant as to the content of the treaties.	1.1144418640655753
We believe it is imperative not just to make every available effort to provide the citizens with comprehensive information on how the Intergovernmental Conference is going, and its outcome, rather they must be directly involved in the overall reform process to a far greater extent.	1.4525286569675249
We also take the view that the political decision-makers must at long last change the habit of a life-time and ask the citizens in referenda, once the Intergovernmental Conference is over, whether or not they go along with the way in which Europe is to continue to develop in the future.	1.3078391800681408
In this way, Europe would truly belong to the citizens and the Union would acquire an entirely new quality of democratic legitimacy.	1.162165640671686
There is another central issue relating to democracy that I would like to make clear reference to.	1.1841510219268383
As a member of the convention that has now taken up its work on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, I wish to make the following point clear: neither my group nor I are content with making a solemn announcement about the Charter.	1.1813699425093926
After all, what will the citizens say if we make a solemn announcement about rights to them but they are unable to take legal action in respect of these rights as individuals?	1.1651336837479334
No, to my mind this would only serve to deepen the credibility crisis facing the Union.	1.0816755762403143
The poor turnout at the European elections really should have been warning enough for everyone.	0.9859974785139173
What we need are visible rights for each and every citizen; the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding for all the citizens of the Union.	1.1052025545981476
Together we should work towards this goal in the interests of the citizens, and what I expect to come out of the Intergovernmental Conference is that the relevant Cologne decision will be revised here at the end of the year.	1.331488286055104
Of course, we are also talking about effectiveness of decisions and functioning institutions in a Union of 27 plus Member States.	1.2634775251687378
We will not achieve this just by undertaking a mini reform, as the Council has resolved to do, and that is why all institutions must come under scrutiny.	1.4867028899428316
We need bold change and, at the same time, we must take care to give the greatest possible attention to equal rights for the major and small States.	1.1857461586856586
This is something I would stress, particularly with my being an MEP for one of the major Member States.	1.5485945433495372
I would like to thank the Commission for the proposals they have put forward and I am certain that comprehensive discussions with the citizens will ensue here in the European Parliament, on all the issues you have raised.	1.3403102988024953
There is one final issue I would like to raise.	1.2519904146158403
Parliament' s opinion expressly demands amendments to the Treaty in the area of economic policy.	1.2633235585725895
It is indeed the case that globalisation of national economies, but above all the introduction of the euro and the associated stability pact have led to a situation where we need to do more than analyse decision-making processes.	1.324468749512648
What we need most of all is to have the courage to undertake a critical examination of the Union' s policies to date.	1.3367332959316445
It is all about creating a socially just Europe.	0.8930852294448695
A socially just Europe is still highly topical, for what we need to do as a matter of priority is place the fight against mass unemployment and poverty firmly at the centre of the Union' s policies.	1.3147585396613422
Hence, to my mind, that includes having the courage to amend Article 4 of the EC Treaty, which defines the Union in traditional neoliberal style as an open market economy with free competition. The same applies to Article 105, in my view, for the European Central Bank must at last be given the political task as enshrined in the Treaty, of using its monetary policy to promote sustained growth and employment.	1.4391013488595275
Mr President, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group considers that the agenda for the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, as set by the Helsinki Council, i.e. focussing strictly on the issue of decision making in an enlarged Europe, must be adhered to.	1.2858268567911326
It must be adhered to in the interests of the fast, effective work of the conference, prior to enlargement.	1.2689624179732089
This is why we cannot subscribe to either the opinion of the European Parliament or indeed to that of the Commission, which both wish to widen this agenda far too much and, what is more, widen it in the wrong direction, i.e. moving towards centralisation and an ever tighter European system.	1.3337171843580766
Our group has therefore tabled a raft of amendments which, when taken together, form a real alternative resolution.	1.1660649120951303
In them we say that the forthcoming IGC must look into a decision-making system that pays greater attention to national sovereignty.	1.3010066990115599
We deplore the fact that the Commission, in its opinion of 26 January, limits itself to following the routine path of a standardised Europe enlarging towards the East, a centralised superstate operating on the basis of majority decisions.	1.2877434685421199
The federalists imagine that they are thereby going to create unity through constraint, but this is a totally superficial concept.	1.2863828234496824
Quite the opposite, in an enlarged Europe, Mr President, the standardisation imposed by the improper use of majority decisions can lead only to the whole thing exploding.	1.2603854321352734
Furthermore, the centralised European system, as we can see it developing today and as we can foresee it by extrapolation, erodes nations and, in eroding nations, erodes the national patriotism which forms the basis of our will to defend ourselves.	1.4638346559782767
The Europe which results from this is not stronger but weaker, as it no longer knows what it is or what it is defending.	1.3431582932380592
This is why we have always said that enlargement was possible only if the diversity and freedom of the peoples of Europe was clearly recognised, i.e. by adopting flexibility founded upon the respect of national sovereignty.	1.2703002229036837
We are delighted today to see the progress this idea has enjoyed in certain circles, one which are still, unfortunately, outside the European Parliament and the Commission.	1.3087888411272788
A flexible Europe, is a Europe which respects its national democracies, which relies on the support of its nations, its national patriotisms, instead of continually persecuting them.	1.3937869399549137
It is this that gives us the determination to defend ourselves against external threats, not the constraining, convoluted decision making procedures which the Commission thought it could propose at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.	1.2152669732424812
Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Italian Radicals and I would like to say to the President of the Council that he has seen what Parliament' s opinion is.	1.4963316511455051
It is no coincidence that the last intervention is the only one that was completely opposed to further European integration. I say this without being the slightest bit ironical about the highly respectable position of Mr Berthu and his group, but it is no coincidence that the European Council' s decision is supported by those who are, after all, in Parliament because - and this is a highly respectable position - they are fighting against further integration.	1.463683910630504
This is the message that Parliament is sending to the Council.	1.4233155356147975
I hope that the Portuguese Presidency - and I add my compliments to those already offered - can convey Parliament' s message and convey the result of our mediation work on Saint Valentine' s day. In any case, tomorrow we shall vote against the IGC agenda.	1.3546794698635047
This message must be very clear; this is how we explain the way we shall vote tomorrow.	1.4101566345283658
We shall give an opinion - which is technically and legally necessary - on convening the IGC on 14 February, but we shall give an unfavourable opinion of its content.	1.3612977347388573
Just consider the facts: we looked at Austria a while ago, but we can also look at the stock markets, Mr President: given that the euro, that great undertaking, has fallen 16% against the dollar in a year, then perhaps, I will not say a government, but a good head of a family should ask himself whether one can conceivably tell the citizens that the only subjects open to negotiation are the number of Commissioners or similar issues.	1.4911020538551556
There is clearly a more ambitious goal.	0.9273392633754489
We Radicals have tabled amendments which we are submitting to the House in order to consolidate this text, and for example, to request - just for the sake of mentioning Articles 6 and 7 - that the very minimum be done, i.e., that the European Parliament should also be involved in drawing up the European Constitution and that a proposal be made for the European Parliament to adopt the amendments to the Treaty.	1.5886447438987767
We know that there are other topics: for example, many Members have subscribed, along with us, to the issue of the seat of the institutions, an issue that we believe should be considered at least at IGC level.	1.3904163713815922
In conclusion, I hope that the message that we give tomorrow will be strong and wide-ranging for once, so that thanks also to the efforts of the Portuguese Presidency, this agenda will be revised.	1.3655173991337692
Otherwise, the challenge really would be lost, not just for the present but also for many years to come.	1.3843844361638649
Mr President, the President of the Commission was not being quite honest when he talked last week about the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.2067813464733845
He said that there would always be unanimity on social questions but, in the Commission' s draft, plans are quite explicitly being made for majority decision-making on issues relating to social security and on taxes connected with the internal market. This means that it will be possible for major parts of the social systems in the Member States to be changed by a majority in Brussels, even if a unanimous French National Assembly, a British House of Commons and a Dutch Lower House should be against this.	1.387304134040722
And, in this regard, you are going to the heart of democracy as it relates to distribution policy and people' s social conditions, which are what voters wish to influence when they go to the polls.	1.3790354725518834
These are matters which we ourselves shall no longer be able to decide upon as voters and no longer be able to change on election day.	1.1701578827671766
Brussels knows best.	0.3465663133967961
Mr Prodi also announced greater transparency, but his draft regulation signals a clear backward step, and that is not only my assessment, but also that of the European Ombudsman.	1.493386732246728
Today, the Commission is obliged, on a case-by-case basis, to weigh considerations of confidentiality against people' s demands for, and expectation of, transparency and, if the Commission' s regulation is adopted, the Commission will be entitled to lock away whole categories of documents without having to give them specific consideration.	1.412570142546262
There is also the desire to create a legal entitlement to confidentiality and to lock away documents of a kind which are at present publicly available in a range of Member States.	1.085375203894758
Under the banner of "progress towards transparency" , a range of documents is being locked away from the general public.	1.0164914231259026
It is, of course, thoroughly Orwellian.	0.8666526689477788
I want to ask Mr Prodi never more to comment on a proposal here in the House which is not, at the same time, available for critical scrutiny by the public.	1.3199941609184158
Mr Prodi secured positive comments for a proposal which would otherwise have been met with criticism, for the new draft regulation presents as progress the fact that it will now be possible to grant right of access to documents in the Commission' s possession. There follows, however, a long, long list of exceptions, and there is legal entitlement to confidentiality in regard to those exceptions.	1.3837818065841399
The French text contains the word "refuse" and the English text the word "shall" , which means that the Commission is to keep secret such information as is today available to the public, for example in my own country.	1.4000334360175242
In addition, we have a flexible clause concerning the efficiency of the negotiations and of the institutions, which may be used for any purposes whatsoever. It is therefore ...	1.5491179229084642
(The President cut the speaker off)	0.0993768251480497
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Portuguese Council Presidency' s account has given me the distinct impression that we are approaching this Intergovernmental Conference with well-considered ideas and a high degree of openness.	1.1147304632220416
We as a European Parliament will use these opportunities to see that our issues are given the attention they deserve.	1.2199873715252745
The preparations the Commission has made so far are on the right track, although they do not go far enough if the European Parliament' s motions are anything to go by.	1.321809984146716
There is more to be said on that score.	1.2282680394435035
It is crucially important for this Intergovernmental Conference to score a hat trick; that of the power to act, democratic legitimacy and transparency.	1.0949860780187808
In the end, it is only by having these three things in place that we will be able to achieve acceptance amongst the citizens.	1.2571454044732182
At the same time of course, we need to create the power to act in order to facilitate the enlargement of the European Union.	1.4454066180391913
If we have been having a different debate here in this Chamber today then that only goes to show how important this is.	1.3092775771665741
The European Union must also have the power to act in the event of a government electing to impose a total blockade.	1.4067845980579565
This is an important sign that majority voting is a crucial pre-requisite to the European Union' s being able to function come what may.	1.231911904857922
This is particularly important where enlargement is concerned, and legislation and in relation to treaties, which entail changes being made to legislation.	1.4016403883074258
Of course we also want to extend the European Parliament' s corresponding powers in this area.	1.184888156303162
In addition, we as a European Parliament are going to have to take action in relation to Economic and Monetary Union, for there is a lack of supervision in this area.	1.570473524235397
The Finance Ministers behave as if they were in an intergovernmental meeting, when in the Ecofin Council and in the Euro 11 Council, which is an unacceptable way to go on.	1.4812451954377333
Unlike Mrs Kaufmann, I am not in favour of extending supervision over the European Central Bank as I am an advocate of independence for the European Central Bank.	1.26945268152911
However, there must be an appropriate level of supervision on the political side.	1.48161754559856
Furthermore, the tripartite relationship of Commission, Council and Parliament must be restored to the sphere of foreign and security policy, where hitherto the Council was in sole charge far more than should have been the case, especially in relation to the crudely fashioned crisis management measures, for which the Commission alone has responsibility.	1.3351977452505261
The overall plan failed to do justice to any of this.	0.8588872751075538
We must examine whether any changes are needed to this end which would fall within the scope of the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.9997001931358227
The Portuguese Presidency has agreed to initiate deliberations on this matter, perhaps to extend the mandate.	1.2367798854116103
There is another point I would just like to draw your attention to.	0.9497979363966904
The debates we are having these days, on a certain European country' s government, for example, show, do they not, that we must place the spiritual, moral, constitutional, community and common welfare-orientated leanings of the European Union on a firm footing, and that legally binding fundamental rights must also be incorporated into the Treaty for the same reason, as this will be a crucial stabilising factor.	1.5706978515715215
I would urge those who are still very hesitant in this respect to consider whether now is not the time to make this connection and perhaps pluck up the courage we need to make suitable progress in matters of fundamental rights.	1.4466714933984315
The European Union needs few, if any, new instruments, and it does not need any new competences.	1.7186110429262673
What it does need are instruments that will enable it to put its competences into practice.	1.049699663220785
For this reason, we must ensure that the instruments have the effect of enabling us to carry out, on behalf of the citizens, the tasks we have already formally been set in the Treaty.	1.3112628025525266
In my view, that is the most important issue this Intergovernmental Conference has to concentrate its energies on.	1.2527337964437428
If we succeed in making progress here, then we will also be ready for the historic task of enlarging the European Union.	1.1084676799350455
This is the crux of the matter.	0.7726729724201338
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am confident that this will be tackled in a suitably positive manner under your tutelage.	0.9807038939219408
, chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. (IT) Mr President-in-Office, on listening to the various interventions, you have understood that in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and also among the leaders of Parliament' s political groups, the decision prevailed - although not without some disagreement - to put our faith in the Portuguese Presidency, instead of creating more difficulties by postponing the start of the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.3266374773298706
I can assure you that it was not easy to achieve this, last week in the Committee I chair, but we eventually decided to back the Portuguese Presidency and we would like to win this wager.	1.5702783352056002
You spoke to us about the start of your tour around the various capital cities and told us about the difficulties that some governments have in reaching a consensus in their own countries, and therefore in their parliaments.	1.2720545595148987
I would like you to bear in mind that yesterday we had a very worthwhile day of discussions and dialogue with the representatives of the 15 national parliaments, which were represented by competent and exacting delegations.	1.3418073176616325
The aim was not to draw conclusions - it was impossible to draw any - but the debate was certainly very encouraging.	1.6174372410259974
We need to be careful and be sure that national governments try to convince their respective parliaments to ratify solutions that correspond to the Union' s requirements for growth and that they do not hide behind supposed resistance put up by the parliaments to avoid signing appropriate conclusions at the Intergovernmental Conference table.	1.1665688892728812
However, we shall intensify our collaboration and our dialogue with the national parliaments for the entire duration of the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.2430259735079647
Yesterday, we also discussed the Commission, represented by Commissioner Barnier, who gave its opinion.	1.500290178678918
This effort was appreciated, even if different views were later expressed as regards the proposals, and moreover, Mr President-in-Office, you also expressed different views.	1.300246285044899
Nevertheless, we must stress that many people are aware, as they were yesterday too, of the risk that enlargement could compromise the original plan for the construction of a political Europe, a risk that was, moreover, indicated in an interview that surely escaped no one' s attention, owing to the authority of the person being interviewed - Jacques Delors.	1.3659239336572087
We must, therefore, ensure that at the Intergovernmental Conference we discuss how to consolidate the democratic bases of the Union and how to strengthen - and this has been discussed in the House even today, with regard to the situation in Austria - the system of principles, values and rights underpinning the Union and the role of the political institutions of the Union, with regard, among other things, to running the economy.	1.4916227244781224
We are counting on the Portuguese Presidency, we are counting on ourselves and we are counting on the Commission so that we can hold constructive and decisive debates on all of this at the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.3124987504354193
Mr President, only a strengthened Europe can cope with enlargement.	1.340447926474585
Only a strengthened Europe is immune to political opportunists who exploit dissatisfaction.	0.7055878976069161
That is why sweeping reforms are necessary and, hence, a widened IGC agenda.	1.4421566124866616
The Finnish Presidency only listened to minimalist governments and, unfortunately, turned a deaf ear to this Parliament.	1.0032383869164136
Portugal should not take a leaf out its predecessor' s book.	0.803902319584343
It is of the utmost importance that the European Parliament and the Commission join forces for this IGC.	1.1961598526834651
In many ways, they share the same interests and the same insights.	1.3348125623008458
An essential component of this joint effort should, in any case, be this Parliament' s right of assent to the forthcoming changes to the Treaty.	1.2625787201185423
Of all priorities, this one is the most pressing.	1.5080753058885026
What is the Commission' s verdict on this?	1.1186183148490243
It also means that our Parliament President and the two representatives should be able to take part on an equal political footing and, therefore, not only within the working party, but also at the same political level as the Commission.	1.5470912203029374
There is no reason whatsoever why representatives directly elected by citizens should be involved in talks at a lower level than the Commission.	1.0840841477342893
Not only do we owe the sweeping reforms to the new Member States, but we owe them to ourselves.	1.31175604498839
If we allow Europe to be watered down as a result of enlargement, we will drown in our own political quagmire.	1.4046420666297184
Mr President, there are days when I really cannot understand this Parliament. It seems to take a masochistic pleasure in self-mutilation.	1.5331224286811131
After having restricted, on its own initiative, its participation in the IGC to two minor seats, Parliament is now giving up the right to add to the agenda for this IGC.	1.4576237715553932
The fact is, whether through weakness or foolishness - nothing to be proud of either way, you will admit - in rushing to give its opinion, Parliament is giving up the only lever which the Treaty accords it, i.e. demanding a complete IGC agenda as a prerequisite before declaring its opinion.	1.37591798413665
Why do we have to vote on this opinion tomorrow, 3 February, as a matter of urgency, when we could wait, in a position of strength, until the opening of the Strasbourg part-session on 14 February, and thus force an agenda that is complete, and therefore consistent, on the Council.	1.5315093123441756
A good dose of hypocrisy is needed to overlook our weakness today.	0.802495000761179
Hypocrisy to be regretted bitterly, in our resolution, that the agenda for the IGC is not equal to the issues, since in our haste, with blameworthy naivety, we are stopping ourselves forcing through this more ambitious agenda.	1.5593475010799391
If there is a democratic deficit at the end of this IGC, then I say that the political groups which so wanted this haste will be accountable for this.	1.4881813838259212
Whether we want it or not, since Parliament itself is going to extinguish the only spotlight capable of shedding a little light on the debates, the venue for decisions is now going to move to the 15 Member States of the Union.	1.1037095223293394
I therefore invite the Members of Parliament who form the great majority, those who last November ruled that the future of Europe was deserving of debates that went far wider than the Amsterdam leftovers, to take up their pilgrims' staffs and go and convince their own governments that this IGC must be extended, since this is permitted according to the resolution of the Helsinki Council.	1.2709969625387687
Because of the situation in Austria, this is a dark day for Europe.	1.2350595316092923
It makes us realise that the victory of democracy is never definitive, and that we have to work to convince and keep on convincing.	1.3366906793591669
In order to assert our fundamental values, they need to be laid down in writing, as a matter of urgency, and, beyond this IGC, I believe we owe Europe a constitution.	1.379826981601818
Mr President, the draft resolution we are now discussing requires, precisely as before, that the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference should have a broad agenda involving radical reforms of the institutions.	1.543426443608972
The forthcoming enlargement of the Union is used as an argument for this.	1.1754446857018142
I am convinced that this is an error of judgement.	1.3324909586822247
A federal and centralist EU which intervenes more and more in the government of the Member States is in actual fact less well placed for enlargement.	1.0915478485988837
A flexible EU which concentrates on fewer but important areas and which respects national differences and national democracy has a better chance of embracing a significantly greater number of countries.	0.9369703808423727
Paragraph D of the draft resolution requires a more coordinated and more open economic policy at EU level.	1.0086372694455783
It is not, however, possible to talk about this without at the same time talking about monetary union.	1.3397667153088957
This text says nothing about the major democratic and political problems involving monetary union and the European Central Bank. This is untenable.	1.3869595295648114
If there is a desire to make the EU more democratic, the whole construction of EMU must be reconsidered.	1.3720747466987997
The Central Bank must be placed under political control so that the direction to be taken by monetary policy may be governed by political objectives such as high employment and prosperity. Public control of the Central Bank must be improved if this is to become possible.	1.301008226764229
The rigid and unsuccessful monetarism of the Stability Pact must be re-examined and discarded so that we might have a uniform policy which has prosperity as its primary objective.	1.0447822442740302
Article 56 of the Treaty, prohibiting currency speculation or any interference in the free movement of capital, must be removed so that damaging currency speculation may be checked by means of political control.	1.0613768468859
In the majority of EU countries, there are now governments dominated by social democrats.	1.146745016181482
It is remarkable that, now they have the opportunity to do so, none of them is demanding any change in the direction taken by monetary union.	1.2922018522329448
It also, of course, damages credibility when it is stated that monetary union could constitute a counterbalance to globalised capital.	0.9657243671142298
The resolution requires the European Parliament to have increased influence over the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.2622202530534388
It is, however, important to emphasise that the Intergovernmental Conference is and will remain a conference of the Member States.	1.2957192415776981
It is the Member States' parliaments, or people voting in referenda, who are to direct the development of the Treaty.	1.5861207277515135
It is therefore out of the question that the European Parliament should be given any formal influence over the negotiation process or over ratification.	1.3237758697985638
Mr President, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has proposed an essentially positive text, which I shall vote for, even if I personally had proposed a lot of amendments to broaden it.	1.4809573283869937
Nevertheless, the events of the last few days show that all those who had made basic criticisms of the way enlargement and the revision of the Treaties have been planned were right.	1.409119293575434
The Union cannot be enlarged to 28 without addressing the matter of whether Europe has certain joint principles and values, whether it comes down to an economic free trade area, or whether, on the other hand, it has a greater ambition: the desire to be a supranational union, in ways that have yet to be defined, that wants to blaze a trail for civilisation and democracy in the world.	1.4142872516596892
This is what is and was meant by the call for a European Constitution.	1.3465082242513116
The amendment of the Treaties was, however, limited to a review of some internal rules, which was necessary and important, but did not answer the fundamental question: what is Europe, what are its common principles and therefore, its objectives and limitations?	1.6347099419777857
However, politics exacts its revenge, and having been thrown out of the window by a debate on a limited agenda, it comes back in, as a matter of fact, through a door, and through the front door in the case of Austria, since a party is entering the Austrian Government which seems to represent a return to intolerance, xenophobia and forms of racism.	1.423427020848799
And it is not a question of links with the past; it is a question of prospects for the future, and nothing could be more wrong than the right and left taking a divided stand on this.	1.3089082751502525
I belong to a world, the world of Liberal Catholics, which is not left-wing but which holds as dear as anyone else the values of tolerance and common European values, and will have nothing to do with policies that reject these values.	1.4100734998792552
The Council has done well to lay open this subject to Europe and to the world and if we do not set down these values in a Charter of Fundamental Rights, in a European Constitution, then we shall construct a Europe without a solid, lasting base.	1.5436029948112253
Commissioner Barnier, I know - at least I think I know - that you and the representatives of the Portuguese Presidency share these values: make the most of the chances you were given by the December Conference to include these subjects and principles, because this is the only way we will build a lasting Europe.	1.4423128682702422
Mr President, I am in the happy position of being able to refer to a couple of striking contributions from a small group of Nordic sceptics and opponents of the drastic and growing integration process which, looked long and hard at, threatens the whole of democratic Europe.	1.1290624936298848
I am thinking of the contributions from Mr Bonde and Mr Sjöstedt who point out that the present contribution contains a string of relatively unconscious but undoubtedly rational initiatives dictated by the desire for power and pointing in the direction of a centralist and federalist EU.	1.1245713521967775
They rightly included the problem with monetary union and centralist government and presented a number of alternative democratic principles.	0.9685922341931807
I might add that all rational political campaigning in my own country, Denmark, takes it for granted that, when we enlarge the circle of EU countries to include the envisaged huge number of new Member States and when we in that way extend the breadth of the Union, we cannot at the same time pursue further integration in depth, that is to say engage in a more intensive qualitative integration towards a United States of Europe.	1.3620467285164184
However, that is precisely what is happening.	1.6514361168771436
With every single geographical extension to the area covered by the EU, we have seen how extensions in breadth have been followed by intensive extensions in depth, and that is precisely what the draft resolution from the Committee is contemplating, especially in paragraph 7 which says that there should be more thorough integration in depth.	1.336977408730992
In the light of developments in recent days, it might well be asked what we really are to do about these intergovernmental conferences and treaty amendments when government leaders - in reality the European Council of Ministers - make decisions in relation to an independent Member State entailing intervention in that Member State' s democratic process.	1.4145421952713944
You can think what you like about Mr Haider, and I personally consider him to be a very dangerous politician, but you cannot just intervene in an independent and friendly country' s democratic process.	1.3484964993561017
When we hold intergovernmental conferences and consider changes to the Treaty, we must take into account the fact that the EU is developing all the time, sometimes in contravention of the Treaty, as we have just seen.	1.5141561904243739
I welcome Commissioner Barnier and the Portuguese Presidency here this afternoon.	0.9614735540480116
On 14 February, we will see the launch of the IGC which is to be completed by the end of 2000.	1.2987949755791561
This is a big task but it can be done.	1.394756738784509
I think it is generally agreed here this afternoon across all groups that the Helsinki agenda will not be sufficient to cover the necessary reform to prepare Europe for enlargement.	1.1439598256582448
In other words we need to go further than what has been referred to as the important "Amsterdam leftovers" .	1.204328358726735
These include the extension of qualified voting - in my country we accept that but not to areas of taxation - the re-weighting of voting in Council to favour larger states and the number of Commissioners in an enlarged Europe.	1.3474372788580635
In relation to the latter point, Ireland wants to maintain the right to nominate a full and equal Member of the Commission irrespective of the number of Member States joining.	1.222238798107535
We are prepared to consider re-weighting the votes in the Council of Ministers, provided that the larger Member States are willing to agree to every Member State having a full and equal Member of the Commission.	1.042104577854863
I feel I speak for many smaller countries when I make that particular point.	0.9130657391734573
At the IGC, we would also need a debate on the possible divisions of the Treaties into two - into a policy area and an area on the Constitution.	1.4903087921023508
We would accept the division of the Treaties providing it would not limit the control the smaller Member States had in the re-negotiation of the whole policy area of the Treaty.	1.3484247731383974
In other words, if we are not represented fully in the Commission we will not have an input into policy discussions.	1.406805349984624
