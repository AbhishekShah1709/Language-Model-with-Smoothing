LEADER + will last a year longer than LEADER 2.	0.8303959092147785
LEADER + can cover all the regions of the EU, while LEADER 2 covered only the Objective 1 regions and some Objective 5b and 6 regions.	1.1962069271233506
We must point out, however, that even if the actual appropriations available for LEADER + were increased, the Community initiative would still be ineffectual because such programmes cannot compensate for or blunt the anti-farming nature of the CAP that will be implemented in the context of 'Agenda 2000' and the WTO. The real outcome of such programmes is to act as a cover-up, to lead people off the scent and to salve consciences.	1.3114253818322508
We disagree with many of the report' s views.	1.1399657556137515
Once more, we point to the negative changes of the CAP (1992 - Agenda 2000).	1.3585716557000234
We do not think LEADER + will contribute substantively towards solving the countryside' s problems, which are characterised by the decline of farming, which was and should remain the countryside' s basic social and economic branch.	1.3813475051418456
For our part, we will tell the farmers about the expediency of these programmes.	1.1069839711771101
We will make every effort to improve them as much as possible and prevent them from being wasted, and most important of all, we will try to foster the struggle of farmers against the disastrous CAP which is disinheriting them and leading them towards economic decline and the desertion of the countryside.	1.2200651908019864
Unless this CAP is overthrown, no programme can ensure the survival of small and medium-scale farmers and the social and economic regeneration of the countryside.	1.09508382658733
All the Members in the Union for a Europe of Nations Group voted in favour of almost the whole of the Procacci report on the LEADER + Community Initiative.	1.1089956633625626
However, we amended the draft report adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in order to clarify certain points which will make this Community initiative more effective.	1.3341685557323248
In particular we felt it was necessary to simplify the administrative and financial procedures which proved to be too cumbersome and slow in the LEADER II initiative.	1.0430085050621367
It was also essential to ensure that better account is taken of the development priorities of local operators and that the benefit of LEADER + funds is not limited solely to agricultural regions with a low population density.	1.1856057342860553
Amendment No 10 which I tabled on behalf of my group refers to the concept of 'economic and social cohesion' rather than 'regional development' as the European Union does not have any recognised competence in this area.	1.309045428918499
Amendment No 11 replaces 'government or municipal officials' with 'government officials' .	0.886483373160243
Although local action groups should consist of a balanced and representative selection of partners drawn from the different socio-economic sectors of the territory concerned, government officials must be involved at decision-making level, whether they come from the municipalities, departments, regions or national governments.	1.226312418659307
The rapporteur' s phrasing was therefore too limiting.	0.7563136083778735
Amendment No 12 responds to the expectations of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of this House.	0.886501193050874
It specifies the necessary coordination between LEADER + and Community cooperation and partnership programmes such as INTERREG, PHARE, Sapard or MEDA.	0.7151326712776964
In the territory of Member States of the European Union, applicant countries or Member States of EFTA, there may be interrelations between the various Community initiatives.	1.3454169424536966
The real priority for the European continent is to establish an operational level within a European framework and not a global framework as proposed by the rapporteur.	1.3625965795407242
The creation of organisations similar to the LAGs may be usefully encouraged by the European Union, provided that the corresponding costs are borne by the various partners.	1.123055302849257
In essence, we are, of course, in favour of this LEADER + Community Initiative.	1.2621353343085808
The conference on rural development held in Cork from 7 to 9 November 1996 set rural development as one of the European Union' s priorities since it is essential to preserve the integrity of our agriculture and the whole rural fabric, including infrastructure, public and private services and so on.	1.0555602184672115
In this context, in committee we regretted the paltry funding allotted to rural development and supported the amendments calling for an increased budget for this Community initiative so that it matches the previous LEADER I and LEADER II initiatives.	1.1949157868047207
The budget allocated to LEADER + for a period of seven years is half that allocated to LEADER II for a period of six years.	0.9042267241280371
This is unacceptable given the importance of rural development and the consequences for farmers of the fall in prices and aid specified in the reform of the CAP following the Berlin agreements.	1.2718727106975303
Finally, among the priority parameters to be introduced at European level to enable local involvement, particular attention must be paid to the quality and originality of projects which have already been implemented by LAGs within the LEADER II initiative, but which could not be concluded due to the timetable and weight of the management mechanisms specified.	1.343898897417226
(The sitting was suspended at 1.40 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)	0.497633973896566
Additives in feedingstuffs	-0.0
The next item is the report (A5-0015/2000) by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 70/524/EEC concerning additives in feedingstuffs (COM(1999) 388 - C5-0134/1999 - 1999/0168(CNS)).	0.7165199090507574
Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, under Directive 70/524, high-technology additives are treated differently, depending on the date of authorisation.	1.159185642374574
The Commission has proposed harmonising the authorisation procedure so that substances licensed before 1988 are put on an equal footing with substances authorised now.	1.045554557882157
As far as we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are concerned, so far so good.	1.3929191401873355
However, the directive also encompasses the authorisation of antibiotics, drugs, growth-promoters and genetically-modified organisms.	1.0440282626440256
That makes it a question of health, not just approximating laws, which is why we in the Committee on Agriculture take the view that the legal base - Article 37 - is not admissible here and that the Commission should submit its proposal to us on the basis of Article 152, that is to say with codecision by Parliament.	1.5765431537482937
We asked the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which pointed out that, as far as approximating laws is concerned, Article 37 is adequate in this case.	1.149003487108779
However, we in the Committee on Agriculture have not confined ourselves to approximating laws; because this proposal also encompasses genetically-modified organisms, we have tabled a further proposed amendment which affects the content and hence public health.	1.4098567375035964
We negotiated with the Commission for two years on the seed directive and came to a compromise regulating the release of genetically-modified organisms in the directive, taking the text on which Directive 70/524 is based as a starting point.	1.2041533126615052
Mr Byrne, we fail to understand why the Commission is not approximating the text on genetically-modified organisms as part of its harmonisation work.	1.4601628994683333
We have now tabled a proposed amendment on precisely this compromise with the Commission on the text.	1.1794977339039467
Moreover, this text has also been adopted in the forest directive on the use of forest reproductive material and we feel that this text urgently needs to be adopted in this directive as well.	1.3835000352297508
The Commission pointed out in committee that it plans to present a novel feed directive in the future.	0.9991721975678609
However, that should not prevent us from harmonising the text in order to ensure that there is no legal uncertainty between the various directives.	1.4273990516187263
We are therefore assuming that you will accept our proposed amendment with regard to genetically-modified organisms.	1.1416630238765304
Directive 70/524 still contains the old text because the seed directive was submitted to Parliament in 1986 and we then negotiated with the Commission until 1988, while the report on this directive was dealt with in 1994 and Parliament obviously did not accord genetically-modified organisms the same importance then as it did later when I was rapporteur.	1.2764765374287892
We therefore assume, Commissioner Byrne, that you too will accept our proposed amendment of the legal base.	1.278548004024183
If you do not, we must reserve the right to refer this report back to committee and then negotiate this sensitive point with you, exactly as we did with the seed directive. I should point out that the text which we have now worked out is a valid compromise, both for your legal service and ours.	1.41060866489339
In other words, we do not need to re-negotiate the text; we merely need to adopt this text in the directive.	1.1216865553955877
I can hardly wait, Commissioner Byrne, to hear what you have to say to our proposals.	1.4369973758298624
Mr President, Commissioner, does regulating additives in feedingstuffs come under competition or consumer policy?	1.131211587816357
As far the Commission and the Legal Affairs Committee are concerned, it comes under competition.	1.5796766863474057
Of course we have to take account of the competitiveness of the feedingstuffs industry by harmonising provisions for substances authorised before and after 1988.	1.1937166263926247
We want to prevent the prices of feedingstuffs from rising and Mr Doyle' s proposed Amendments Nos 4 and 5 therefore deserve our support.	1.0139051190282342
However, as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has said in his report, this is first and foremost a consumer policy matter.	1.5644755245856476
Food safety must take absolute priority over feedingstuffs in all our discussions.	0.8660721178976498
When we talk of transparency in the food chain, that applies from the hayfork to the table fork and consumer protection therefore logically starts with feedingstuffs.	1.2069155120991781
The antibiotics, growth promoters and genetically-modified organisms mixed in with feedingstuffs end up in the human food chain.	1.0902867579507622
The dioxin scandal brought home to us that we have to get out of this mess once and for all and regulating additives in feedingstuffs is a step in the right direction.	1.0795205355691724
According to Article 152 of the EC Treaty, we are obliged to obviate sources of danger to human health, whereby the accent is clearly on sources.	1.0981027696371244
Consequently, we must cut off the supply of the original source of danger, i.e. harmful additives in feedingstuffs.	1.2718770815462475
Otherwise, in my view, we are beavering away at the symptoms, but not the causes.	1.5366223832155057
People are especially wary of GMOs.	0.5022845228379735
We must confront increasing public awareness of GMOs by regulating their use in feedingstuffs accordingly.	0.8752617309767118
First, if an additive consists of or contains genetically-modified organisms, then it should only be authorised if it poses no risk to human health or the environment.	1.22211418326095
Secondly, it makes sense to issue provisions for genetically-modified feedingstuff additives similar to the regulations in seed marketing legislation, as the rapporteur has said.	1.3692263200873045
And thirdly, if we are to have a transparent consumer policy, we need to label genetically-modified feedingstuffs.	1.2701687156989763
A clear declaration on feedingstuffs will allow double freedom of choice, both for the party using the feedingstuff and the subsequent consumer.	1.0680711707219321
Responsible citizens should, in my view, have a choice.	1.2353312848557838
We all talk of scandalised citizens who have lost confidence in food safety.	0.9344931759959312
By regulating additives in feedingstuffs consistently, we can help significantly to restore confidence.	1.3577942179348124
I too, therefore, can hardly wait to hear what you have to say to our proposed amendments.	1.339245289789083
Consequently, we too shall also vote to reserve our right to refer the proposal back to committee if need be.	1.3166029149165495
Mr President, this proposal to amend the 1970 directive on additives in feedingstuffs is the first in a whole series of proposals on the subject of feedingstuffs.	1.3403841682244753
In other words, we shall be discussing other proposals here in Parliament over the next few months.	1.1574423121215478
That this subject is of paramount importance is borne out by the huge public attention which the dioxin, antibiotic, sludge and other scandals have attracted.	1.0040325587320316
In other words, this is an important facet of public health protection, which is why we believe that Article 152 should be taken as the legal base, not Article 37, as proposed by the Commission.	1.4901188500843168
The amendment which the Commission has proposed, namely equal treatment for additives authorised before or after 31 December 1987, is uncontested and has our full support.	1.2407822656956162
However, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has voted unanimously on some important amendments to the Commission proposal.	1.290795644075231
The regulation proposed by the Commission conceals the danger of creating a marketing monopoly for certain additives.	0.9377254029128306
Only companies which obtained the original authorisation will have the right to apply and companies which obtained authorisation at a later date will be excluded.	1.1385815175701106
This sort of monopoly, which could lead, for example, to an increase in the price of feedingstuffs, should be prevented by granting provisional authorisation to all companies which had marketed a specific substance by 1 April 1998.	1.2232521074229372
This would then apply until the re-assessment procedure has been completed.	0.8511642602632676
The most important amendment to the Commission proposal is the inclusion, as recommended by the rapporteur, of genetically-modified organisms in the directive on additives, taking the compromise negotiated between Parliament and the Commission on authorisation for GMOs outside the scope of the release directive as the starting point.	1.4884527104732241
This already gives us a basis for the authorisation of GMOs.	0.9236344911617059
It is therefore only logical that we make provision for genetically modified feedingstuff additives in this case, just as we have in regulations already passed in other areas, such as forest reproductive material, to mention just one example.	1.3331676763248475
The labelling of genetically-modified additives is particularly important in this respect.	0.9991098282525867
On the one hand, it enables farmers to make an informed decision as to whether or not they wish to use such feedingstuffs and, on the other hand, it enables consumers to avoid foodstuffs produced using GMOs.	1.2594658383203123
Finally, our group should like once again to thank the rapporteur, who has gone to a great deal of trouble.	1.494424004083894
I think that we can all hardly wait to hear Mr Byrne' s reply.	1.2116122186343279
Mr President, the report deals mainly with formalities, in other words, the manner in which additives will be authorised. It is less concerned with the types of additives and how they work.	1.3293313141562155
I should like to take this opportunity to stress how important it is that, in future, all the directives are dealt with under Article 152, since both food safety and environmental issues require a coherent policy and a comprehensive overview.	1.3584078425554427
We cannot carry on as we have done up until now, that is to say dealing with each detail on its own, often only after the harm has already been done.	1.3433195447935153
The rapporteur places the emphasis on the testing and labelling of GMOs in feed additives.	0.7747859235572074
However, I should like once again to raise the issue of antibiotics.	1.2164039050376159
Certainly, five of the nine antibiotics that were originally permitted in animal feed have now been banned.	0.9918443637358452
It is nevertheless extremely important to ban the remaining four, both in the interests of human health and for the sake of the animals themselves.	1.2319481007757218
We now know that resistance to antibiotics poses a very serious threat to people's health, particularly in the case of small children.	1.0809171468786851
A number of Member States are already able to show conclusively that improper practices in connection with the keeping of livestock are totally unnecessary.	1.097968422074287
Several countries phased out antibiotics in animal feedingstuffs a long time ago and others are in the process of successfully doing the same.	0.9703647582455868
We talk a great deal about the precautionary principle but, in the case of antibiotics, it has long since been forgotten.	1.3754843141736475
However, there is another environmental principle at stake, namely the exchange principle.	1.5149911020730797
I should like to say a few words about coccidiostats.	0.9861315312486209
They are a zootechnical product which is not totally necessary.	1.185489945466077
There is a substitute, which is used to vaccinate chickens.	1.5338260280172322
Although it is a little more expensive, it does not harm the environment.	1.4168118431405115
Coccidiostats now accompany the manure that is spread on the fields. In that way, they end up in our water supplies which, as we all know, are our most vital resource.	1.3710824022659573
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report on additives in animal feedingstuffs concerns the technical and economic problem of restoring the competitive balance between different additives in feedingstuffs and between producers of these additives.	1.1280508306942663
Yet after the serious dioxin crisis which affected Belgium and other European countries last summer we cannot just view this issue in terms of competition.	1.1144611251139633
You may recall, even though this passed virtually unnoticed by the general public, that the Commission' s scientific experts discovered industrial residues of dioxin-loaded chemical lime in the pulp of citrus fruit imported from Brazil.	1.0228166133330545
We must therefore closely examine all the elements of the chain involved in the manufacture of feedingstuffs for production animals.	1.0782962303528991
Incidentally, it is ironic that the problem is much less serious for the feedingstuffs of our dogs, cats and other domestic animals.	1.2557848175442858
Is it because of cut-throat and globalised competition that industrialists have allowed this sector to become a way of recycling all the waste from the agri-foodstuffs industry?	0.9914436436460073
Such a serious issue cannot be limited to a technical debate, even though it is the directive itself which limits the authorisation of antibiotics and other growth promoters.	1.2437141819439363
The precautions which we are preparing to take in respect of feedingstuffs must also be applied to the food for the very farm animals which reach our plates.	1.195010350752955
As forcefully underlined by this report, labelling is an absolute necessity so that each farmer on his holding is aware of all the ingredients in the feed which he is giving his livestock.	1.0760289175680375
He must also know whether his bag of protein granules includes GMOs as these components could represent a risk to public health.	0.8366939950341932
In any case, the precautionary principle requires these products to be clearly traceable at all stages of their marketing.	1.0005739270811023
However, before labelling we need clear rules.	1.44768996175303
Straight questions must be asked about the real end-use of animal meal, for example.	0.9945824583599782
Although we are looking at all the problems caused by these products in ethical and health terms, it is their use which must be questioned today.	1.3057903222616607
In this respect, the chapter of the White Paper on food safety which deals with feedingstuffs must serve as a working basis for going beyond mere commercial questions.	0.9312492105293508
The Commission has on many occasions used the farm-to-table example which our colleague in the PPE Group has just underlined.	1.2001135693205427
This is a good idea but it must be made to be meaningful and, to do this, the problems linked to animals and those linked to consumer health must be dealt with at the same time.	1.5572424015330304
This is why it is essential to approve Amendment No 2 to Recital 4 which avoids the risks of the monopoly which would arise if companies which were the first to be authorised to place an additive on the market were to remain the only ones able to continue marketing it during the re-evaluation procedure.	1.1498147615993408
Also, Amendments Nos 4 and 5 to the new Article 2a must be approved as these will ensure that genetically modified additives are clearly identified as such, thus allowing users to make fully informed decisions.	1.205634838489684
Mr President, because of the availability of high-technology additives in the feedingstuffs industry, detailed information on their use is needed from the actors, and as we know there are a lot of them, so that we can put a stop to practices which infringe Community law.	1.3534606253986956
This directive on additives in feedingstuffs cannot achieve this on its own.	0.9293757609376289
Other directives will follow and I believe that the Committee on Agriculture is well placed to deal with them.	1.2397776792754687
Up the point at which meat, milk, bread and other products are sold over the shop counter, feedingstuffs and additives are structured, mixed, blended, cut and transported several times.	0.9423071088455147
The fight by feedingstuff manufacturers to gain maximum market shares causes a lot of problems, just as it does in the foodstuffs industry.	1.148761916331647
The negative consequences are well known, the positive ones less so.	1.2074029335065026
I am firmly convinced that the most sensible way of protecting the health of European citizens in the ecological chain is through the production of feedingstuffs in the region for the region.	1.2427826762434906
However, more work is needed on this.	1.691798284540564
Mr President, may I commence by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on his report.	1.1955145230905655
It reflects the views and concerns of all EU citizens in the area of food safety and quality.	1.0478255764732183
The events of the past couple of years have certainly created an awareness and concern about the real threat to food safety and public health.	1.083414706416679
The swift action taken by this Parliament must be seen by all citizens as their greatest guarantee for the future, for you have set an agenda on food quality to which Member States must conform.	1.411482060031572
But even in this crucial area of administration, Parliament reflects its commitment to subsidiarity by encouraging Member States to take on and to face up to their responsibility.	1.2509074279991004
In Agenda 2000, we have in my view prioritised policies that are of direct concern to citizens: food safety, water quality, environmental protection and rural development.	1.3391326716961072
If we pursue this agenda with commitment and diligence, the early years of the new millennium will be a milestone in the implementation of policies that are people-focused and very much reflect community needs.	1.2758364434410372
I welcome in particular the proposed new and strict authorisation procedures for additives in animal feeds.	1.047496023774027
Those found in breach of them must be dealt with severely.	0.8035138931013313
I compliment the new Commissioner responsible for food safety, Mr Byrne.	1.01782139848005
He has an onerous undertaking but he has responded quickly and effectively to the requirements of this House, as well as to the concern of consumers.	1.1189861346986214
I am particularly pleased that my own country, Ireland, is to the forefront in the implementation of new food regulations based on the principle of traceability.	1.2581826710289044
This will make the island of Ireland the centre of excellence in the future for food production.	1.2896984059263283
Mr President, Commissioner, I too congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work. I am particularly pleased about the unanimity shown on this issue within the group.	1.4854549967371062
It is therefore specified that, through the adoption of a regulation, the Commission will replace the existing authorisations with authorisations linked to the person responsible for putting the additives into circulation. This will occur at the same time for all the additives in question.	1.476785936152243
A coherent legal framework must be re-established.	0.6805442603025791
As of October 1999 the Commission proposed introducing a legal basis into Directive 70/524/EEC for the replacement of the authorisations.	1.0261816459990345
However, we must ensure that competition distortions are not created, as highlighted by Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi.	1.252061860332633
Genetically modified additives must also be clearly identified in feedingstuffs in order to allow the end-consumer to choose food without GMO components or based on GMO components and to guarantee this.	1.1315213244928293
The consumer must remain free to make a fully informed decision.	1.0538339866329345
This proposal has no financial consequences for the Community budget.	1.0729736957160394
There must therefore be total transparency for producers and consumers in the area of food safety.	0.838156348426472
I am sure that the Commission can accept the report which, as you know, was approved unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.	1.3367704453767912
Mr President, we have said in this House time and again since the BSE crisis that feedingstuffs are one of the first and most important factors in safe food production and in consumer health and protection.	1.4388642121363224
We therefore welcome the Commission' s proposal on additives in feedingstuffs.	0.991077162842912
The Committee on behalf of which I am speaking, namely the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, decided in December, on the assumption that the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture would draft such a good report, that we could waive our opinion.	1.4903709126745004
Nevertheless, I should like to say a few words on the report and express a view on a number of points.	1.2243666922508687
First, perhaps, I should say something on the question of the legal base.	1.4691656738024035
Even if we have new Rules of Procedure in Parliament, and it may well be that, with such an ambitious chairman in the Committee on Agriculture, problems of legislative competence will arise more and more frequently between the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on the Environment, one thing is always crystal clear for me in this sort of conflict: cohesion in this Parliament is crucial and the legal basis of a question is crucial as far as I am concerned.	1.5095906321344323
Therefore, and I must address this comment to you Mr Byrne, I reject your choice of legal basis.	1.4659644070446367
If it is merely a hand-me-down legal basis taken over from previous directives, then it is a mistake to keep it.	1.278046828378324
The Treaty of Amsterdam states quite clearly that, where people' s health is concerned, Article 152 is the correct legal base, and may I say to our own Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that it is simply not good enough to look at the Commission' s proposal and say, there is nothing in it about health and consumer protection, so it has nothing to do with health and consumer protection.	1.4103117467573763
My group, as Mr Kindermann has already said, will therefore vote tomorrow to change the legal base and I hope that other groups in this House will do likewise.	1.5534918274003773
Mr Byrne, I ask you to accept and agree to the change of legal basis for the sake of transparency and good cooperation.	1.4787271998260965
If we do not change it and we follow the Legal Affairs Committee, we shall be opening the floodgates to manipulation.	1.3114392030532123
The Commission would be able to determine the choice of legal basis by excluding any reference to health policy and we would suddenly find ourselves up against an Article 37.	1.146174579676573
Allow me to comment briefly on two other points. First, genetically modified micro-organisms in feedingstuffs.	1.037130107572201
We cannot just refer to vertical legislation and say that at some point we will need another law.	1.1960134795837736
We do not have another law at the moment, and until we do, we must deal with genetically-modified micro-organisms as and when we pass legislation; we must include them as an add-on and insist that they be labelled.	1.4171164774934344
The rapporteur has done just that and that is a good sign.	1.5522647122707913
I say now, as I have said on numerous occasions in the past: yes, I too would like the Commission to propose a positive list which we can then debate and deal with in this House, but we do at least need a starting point for a positive list of additives in feedingstuffs.	1.484889426916573
It is equally important to have strict hygiene requirements for the manufacture of additives and for proper controls to be carried out in the Member States.	0.9968219188901024
There are serious shortcomings in both areas and we have a great deal of work to do yet.	1.2116089502656724
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report.	0.8892867878755383
This is an issue that we will no doubt be reconsidering on a number of occasions in the future.	1.2690973429144168
What has happened in recent years has brought to our attention the tremendous problems facing not only to the producers of food but also the consumers.	1.2813655729801
We must strike a balance between them.	0.6469422459892802
We must resolve this issue, because it is important that consumers should regain confidence in the food they eat.	1.1740057945898945
One way to achieve this is to have total transparency as far as food labelling is concerned.	1.3816926669006417
GMOs are the new challenge facing us.	0.8455801472689962
This is something that people are very worried about and quite rightly so: I myself share these concerns.	1.142620373827381
But I think we should not allow our concerns about GMOs to overshadow our concerns about growth promoters used in animal feed or antibiotics used in compound feed.	1.1460616783583455
Indeed, we should not allow GMOs to obscure the fact that meat and bonemeal are still included in animal feeds in many countries in Europe.	1.1937814964422022
One factor behind these developments that has been referred to in this debate is competition - competition between Member States on the cost of the production of food.	1.2987653009610571
These are all areas in which we have to ensure a level playing field: food must be of the same standard in all Member States.	1.2930899723761502
We have had the dioxin scare, BSE and many other problems.	1.287508738994161
The main problem is a financial one, namely who bears the cost?	1.2139050279435393
The problem is that the cost is not shared equally between the consumer and the producer: the producer has been forced to bear all the cost.	1.1145700748219733
We need an equitable distribution of the extra cost that has been incurred.	1.0074780562776613
We must also ensure that the food that is imported into the European Union meets the standards within the European Union.	1.2329166561189353
If we do not maintain those standards for imported food then we are going to encounter greater difficulties in the future.	0.9377772753822297
. I should first like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its rapporteur, the committee chairman, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, for examining the Commission's proposal.	1.5518216994538265
The Commission proposal is, as some of you have said, rather technical.	1.5983517827346287
Nonetheless it has a relatively simple objective: to harmonise procedures governing the authorisation of feed additives.	1.0290462860426788
At present there is a difference in treatment between authorisations, depending on whether applications were submitted before or after 1 January 1988.	0.9959541200299524
The purpose of the Commission's proposal is to harmonise procedures to ensure that no such difference exists.	1.388544262261344
The scope of the proposed amendment is therefore very limited.	1.1733471859570979
Five amendments have been presented by Parliament.	0.9798464772508131
I regret that the Commission is not in a position to accept these amendments, despite the fact that I am fully aware of the views and commitment of Parliament, the Agricultural Committee and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on these issues.	1.3905719816421258
I shall deal with each of the individual amendments separately.	0.9536915967132337
The first amendment proposes to change the legal base of the proposal by replacing Article 37 with Article 152.	1.117035216128436
I would simply point out that the Commission proposal makes no reference to health or consumer protection.	1.4828680454996572
The proposed amendment is technical and cannot be interpreted as having as its primary objective the protection of public health.	0.9971862397471091
I note that Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market also accepts that Article 37 is the appropriate legal base.	0.9530561614707368
I remind Parliament that in Article 152 the primary objective is the protection of health.	1.043694437862597
I commend to you the arguments set out in the letter from the Legal Affairs Committee which sets out the position, in my view, with precision, clarity and commendable brevity.	1.2090351816794875
Amendments Nos 2 and 3 go much further than the Commission proposal since they aim to introduce additional provisions on genetically modified additives.	1.0763677588361746
I am the first to accept that GMOs are a very important issue.	1.3190070715960849
I also accept and acknowledge that a number of initiatives to update EU legislation in the field of GMOs are necessary.	1.0313620264238186
However, this technical amendment is not the correct instrument to introduce such initiatives.	1.5681348623842029
The Commission is of the view that it is premature to amend the rules currently laid down by Directive 70/524 on genetically modified additives at this stage.	1.2168695630965511
Instead it is appropriate to await developments in relation to the common position on the amendment to Directive 90/220, which is currently in second reading in Parliament.	1.4315611943223763
The Commission envisages going much further than is currently proposed by Parliament in its amendments.	1.0740155951051955
I can also assure Parliament that I will ensure that the pertinent provisions of Directive 90/220 are included in the proposal for a recasting of Directive 70/524 that the Commission has proposed in the White Paper on food safety to present to Parliament before July 2001.	1.2355464728761123
I can also assure Parliament that all observations made here today will be fully taken into account.	0.9324812587064444
Amendments Nos 4 and 5 are also unacceptable because they give undue preference to copy products by granting them authorisation to be placed into circulation even before an application for authorisation has been submitted.	0.9618208935372498
The Commission insists on first evaluating such applications as to their safety and efficacy before giving authorisations.	0.8021756033557074
I can only ask you again to bear in mind the technical nature of the Commission proposal and to wait for the substantive proposal for a new directive on additives in feedingstuffs to address wider issues.	1.4587831186624398
I should just like to deal with some of the specific issues that were raised during the debate.	1.004011540155605
First of all, regarding the observations made by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, I wish to assure him that we will change the procedure for authorisation of GMO additives in the Additives Directive 70/524, and not in the Novel Feed Directive.	1.2430542061249277
This is a directive that deals more specifically with raw materials rather than with additives.	1.119452642998379
The text taken by Parliament is from the Directive which was adopted in 1998.	1.1728717019735433
But the vertical legislation in Directive 90/220 on how to carry out the environmental risk assessment of GMOs has changed since then and is still changing.	1.0712172705921996
It is before Parliament for second reading.	0.8621544567304313
It is my belief that we should await the final outcome of Directive 90/220 and in particular, Article 11.	1.3934852142726293
Reference was also made to the question of whether this proposal could give rise to the risk of the establishment of monopolies.	1.1505153536160149
Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi made reference to this.	0.6386330102105424
There are just a few points I should like to make on that issue.	1.461478388704176
First of all, this matter has been in the pipeline since 1993, so it has not really been sprung on any other commodity producers.	1.3972697159249616
Indeed any such applicants can still apply in respect of their particular product.	0.8681595386486325
I should also stress that the Commission has never approved any application for an authorisation for GMOs to be included in additives.	1.3040929855442744
Mrs Roth-Behrendt made reference to the question of the appropriate legal base, whether it should be Article 37 or Article 152.	1.194346998477719
I again refer to what I said earlier in relation to this and assure her and the House that it would be entirely inappropriate for the Commission to seek to justify any measure based on Article 37 merely by excluding from the provision any reference to public health.	1.3170964365950064
This is an issue that has been looked at on at least two separate occasions by the European Court of Justice, which has laid down the legal criteria for situations such as this where the appropriate legal base has to be properly taken into account when putting forward legislation.	1.3196741086367987
The jurisprudence of the Court appears to be quite clear in relation to this.	1.3098540079622591
As an overall comment to the suggested amendments here, particularly in relation to the legal base issue, it would be inappropriate, in my opinion, to change the legal base to Article 152 in these circumstances, as it would be very likely to fall foul of the objective criteria that have been laid down by the Court.	1.4573090084348517
A number of you made reference - Mr Nicholson in particular - to the issue surrounding labelling.	1.4408056756410021
Directive 70/524 foresees the issue of labelling in the genetic modification of additives.	0.8833558270821747
It is already included now: "indication of the particular characteristics due to the manufacturing products".	1.192660330137617
So this issue will be addressed.	0.9252639360860193
That formula enabled us to oblige applicants to put on the label the fact that genetic modification techniques have been used in the product, the subject matter of the application.	1.247599087213287
Mr President, allow me to ask the Commissioner one more question.	1.2304203482732758
First allow me to point out, Commissioner Byrne, that the European Parliament has no right of legislative initiative.	1.5516630734262857
But we do reserve the right, when you propose to amend a directive or a regulation, to look at the whole regulation and not just the part which you have singled out.	1.3000619299227856
Nonetheless, we have confined ourselves in our proposed amendments to bringing the text into line with that of other directives and we have disregarded the question of content.	1.3587689539812804
For example, you did not go into antibiotics.	1.4466547721174108
We are therefore talking about harmonising the legal provisions in the individual directives.	1.1428122020894678
My question, Commissioner Byrne is this: the UN conference in Montreal decided that genetically-modified organisms must be labelled for international trade.	1.2328037973326929
Do you really believe that, if we could, Parliament would permit labelling to be left off feedingstuff additives within the European Union?	1.4145599438526186
Commissioner Byrne, it appears that you want to engage in a test of strength with Parliament.	1.0956642724799084
We negotiated the seed marketing legislation for two years.	0.7125867292242911
I look forward to the next round.	1.1053415933876918
. I would stress that no GMOs have been approved under this directive; it applies only to additives.	1.3506123108680805
I would also say in relation to the questions surrounding labelling that this is a complex issue.	1.5320060332957253
It is being addressed and will be addressed in a comprehensive way, particularly in Directive 90/220.	1.3573496097224105
This issue is before Parliament at the moment and there will be other directives dealing it, which will also come under the legal base of Article 152 which gives Parliament full competence in the areas of codecision.	1.381408411110247
I would assure Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf that it is by no means my intention or wish to have any clash or test of strength with Parliament on this issue.	1.0970877858366002
It is my intention, as it has always been, to work in cooperation with Parliament, to ensure that the results we achieve are the very best results.	1.5742883224540862
The best way of dealing with this issue is through the draft legislation before Parliament at the moment, as well as the legislation in the pipeline, rather than in this technical document and in circumstances where the questions that are set out and to be debated in Directive 90/220 may not be fully taken into account.	1.22581688528634
It is best to wait for that debate which, I understand, will take place fairly soon.	1.5439894674166703
All of these matters will be addressed in that legislation.	1.086680978915097
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6737777542510281
Parliament has taken due note of your comments.	0.9412262066242231
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	0.28917441844220476
Scrapie	-0.0
The next item is the report (A5-0023/2000) by Mr Böge, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 91/68/EC as regards scrapie (COM(1998) 623 - C4-0026/1999 - 1998/0324(COD)).	0.7078817387949894
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was and always will be one of life' s mysteries, one of the unsolved riddles of the follow-up to the BSE crisis, that we still have no Community rules for the control of scrapie in sheep.	1.1545808770246406
In this respect, the Commission' s proposals to amend directive 91/68 and delete the reference to scrapie and the report by Mrs Roth-Behrendt on the detection and control of TSE infections in general, comply with Parliament' s demands in the wake of the follow-up report by the BSE committee of inquiry and we expressly welcome this.	1.1874887275324102
I should, however, like to add that no new scientific knowledge was needed which proved that the experimental infection of sheep by feeding them BSE-infected feed produced a clinical expression of the disease which is indistinguishable from the symptoms of scrapie.	1.0044895537746512
No new knowledge was needed, because the theory from the beginning was that BSE and scrapie must be related and this theory has increasingly taken hold.	1.0987577901750705
From this point of view we are slightly behind the times.	0.8557056138768475
I am therefore in complete agreement with the Commission' s proposal on scrapie.	1.2485480469349686
I should, however, like to add that it only makes sense if we ensure that the new TSE regulation allows a reasonable symbiosis between consumer protection and practicable suggestions.	1.2025692184550696
We therefore need to take consistent account of six or seven points in the coming debate on the TSE proposal, and that of course includes scrapie.	1.3830900751497621
When we discuss the TSE regulation, Commissioner, we must also clarify that we shortly intend to discuss separate proposals under Article 152 as the corresponding legal base for products excluded from this regulation, such as cosmetics, medicinal products or animal feed.	1.1347878233883262
We insist on this.	0.48639671961039055
As far as I am concerned, that means that fundamental core provisions in this proposed regulation must not be relegated yet again to the Annex but included in the body of the proposed regulation because we here in Parliament want to and will assume joint responsibility here.	1.1790956564223625
It also means that, when we are fighting these diseases, the problem of destroying whole herds in the event of an outbreak of scrapie or BSE and the question of defining geographical areas are items which also remain on the agenda.	1.1981418485333073
Although I welcome the fact that the fight against scrapie is included in the TSE regulation, I feel that the Commission' s proposals for fighting scrapie are still not consistent enough and I shall submit amendments on behalf of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development to tighten up the proposals when the Roth-Behrendt report is debated.	1.3404386433812252
I should also like to address two other points. We expressly welcome the regional classification of the status of Member States as regards outbreaks of scrapie or TSEs.	1.2305259481299187
Here again the Commission is increasing its response to the work carried out by and the demands made by Parliament.	1.365745766860341
Finally, in discussing the question of the future application of tests, we should of course bear in mind that we have still not reached the point where tests are generally applicable.	1.5462618017176704
But the tests available now are perfectly able to guarantee security in consumer health policy, albeit not for every individual animal.	1.1502636782867235
But when we need to consider if a region can move from a negative epidemiological status to a better category, an epidemiological inspection of the situation in a region in the form of suitable sampling in abattoirs using such tests can provide useful pointers in the political and scientific debate as to where there is a need for preventive consumer protection and, basically, where such tests can be used to help us settle disputes on a proper basis.	1.3156554859533487
I would be grateful, Commissioner, if you would take these passing comments on board in the report on scrapie and in the general report on the fight against TSEs and bear in mind that we shall be calling you to account on these points.	1.411002028625855
Mr President, over the years, the following situation has arisen: one subject has developed into a subject of many facets.	1.3021972211094262
Many of us here in this House have spent years, whether we intended to or not, dealing solely with the consequences of the BSE scandal right down to the last detail.	1.3907880536994353
And it is still on the agenda today.	1.3259538957074184
It is therefore hardly surprising that I and Mr Böge are talking about it and that Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has just mentioned it in his report.	1.3778212404687835
The cast is always the same.	0.7425550302882862
Although the cause was unfortunate, it was certainly not the worst experience of this Parliament.	1.3075609607493706
My task as draftsman of the opinion of the Environment Committee is a very simple one.	1.3319274593361907
I agree with the rapporteur and am able to say that the Environment Committee has asked the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to agree to the Commission proposal.	1.3990197607960086
That saves a great deal of time which I would like to use for other things and which I shall use now somewhat in anticipation, as Mr Böge has just done.	1.4758477738167568
I have yet to submit my report on TSEs to the House.	0.8682726846624459
At first we were somewhat irresolute and we regret that now.	0.8282242114464706
But I have come to the conclusion that it was in fact quite clever timing.	1.2277723210502363
This debate does in fact give us an excellent opportunity, Mr Byrne, to give the Commission a few things to think about.	1.4392928794839353
Although we did not have a very positive exchange on Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf' s report earlier on and will certainly have to agree to disagree, things may be different with this report.	1.4144022890030745
Allow me to say from the outset that the part of the complex report which Mr Böge dealt with - and this form of collaboration between two committees, with one leading committee and the other giving an opinion and vice versa, worked very well and could perhaps be used as a model for the future - is relatively simple.	1.4005558575994106
It will become more difficult once we see the TSE proposal, Mr Byrne.	1.1479640248756477
When we have the chance to ask direct questions, the questions which Mr Böge referred to will be asked.	1.2280909963316218
Questions will be asked - questions which I shall have to put to you and the Commission representatives in committee - on how things stand with the BSE status of the Member States and other third countries.	1.5742821494774972
How will BSE status in fact be defined then?	0.9099928110350829
Do you envisage circumstances under which the BSE status will depend on the willingness to apply a BSE test?	1.012055184436788
And then there is my standing question to you Mr Byrne, a question you certainly already know and which will not surprise you. What about the BSE test?	1.3106930592683683
When will you make it compulsory?	0.8799539738353184
Perhaps you will do so before Parliament debates the TSE report.	1.0205654048656179
Not that I want to put it off, but it would be a gesture, as it were, if you could say: here is the proposed legislation on the BSE test.	1.525385456170271
I know that I am a thorn in your side on this, but sometimes that is my job.	1.521276003106037
I say quite emphatically, even after the report by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, who is completely involved in the whole idea, that animal feeding, animal rearing, animal production must be suited to the species and must also, above all, cause no harm or danger to human beings.	1.23891135354274
Cosmetic, medical and other products cannot be excluded on the grounds that they cause no harm or are not dangerous.	1.1058782825705797
That is, without doubt, too short, too sweet and too little.	1.404010886634622
You are lucky that Mr Böge' s report only deals with this on the sidelines; with my report you will have to justify yourself more thoroughly and you will have more trouble doing so.	1.1441309064896215
Finally, just one more brief comment, Mr Byrne.	1.613793663653392
We have a new Commission.	1.234069974026361
Whether or not we will agree with the work carried out by this Commission and the President of the Commission, only time will tell.	1.293294463356583
But there is one thing we certainly will not let you get away with and I am sure that, as a lawyer and politician you will understand this. Important issues cannot be regulated in annexes.	1.4221614826250286
They belong in the legislative text. I might do the same if I were a Commissioner, because I could simply change an annex under a comitology procedure and I would not always need to work with Parliament, which takes so long and is so difficult.	1.5834497041410838
But you must understand that we cannot let you get away with this.	1.017574144012923
In other words, whenever I get the chance, I shall take everything out of the annexes and cram it into the legislative text.	1.1810902507532453
And you would be well advised to do likewise from the outset.	0.9651293671956565
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to remind you of the composition of our food chain and how important it is for this chain to provide us with safe, healthy food which is produced, as a matter of principle, without any questionable or risky interim or end products.	1.1299960195724992
Over recent years, these basic principles have often been neglected in animal husbandry and in epidemiological matters because of shoddy practice or greed.	1.0127343929025796
The European Parliament has already taken a clear stand on BSE and I think that we should do likewise on all epidemics in animals.	1.349613799289117
We should not allow food safety to be compromised because, in the final analysis, it is our health which is at stake.	1.3226505678491802
The Commission' s proposal encompasses both the transportation and the placing on the market of sheep and goats and a Community regulation to fight scrapie.	1.1064234620480704
This is even more important given that there is no clear proof that BSE and scrapie are unrelated.	1.1390482745421935
Animals are bought throughout Europe and transported over the entire continent.	0.8701675825149708
The spread of an epidemic as the result of bringing in one sick animal can have huge consequences for farmers.	0.892166082683737
And I should point out that, for the first time in history, a case of scrapie was detected in Austria about four weeks ago.	1.2655511029675812
Scrapie is a particularly insidious disease because the pathogen can remain active in dust for years and is then ingested in food.	0.8975944488867053
The disease is always fatal.	0.6046567825611722
As there is no vaccination, farmers can only protect themselves by not buying animals from countries in which there are cases of scrapie.	1.1233478878105827
Even if scrapie cannot be passed on to human beings, the connection with BSE has still not been clarified, as I have already said.	1.3002554497035204
As a farmer myself, I am most concerned that consumer health should not be put at risk.	1.3678749252356799
I am in favour of preventive measures, starting with feeding which is suitable for the species, rather than measures to combat an epidemic once it has broken out.	1.024204766230104
I therefore welcome the Commission' s initiative to create a new legal base for combating scrapie.	1.2253136890781515
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Böge' s report on measures to prevent TSE diseases is based on the proposals of the European Parliament' s temporary BSE Committee.	1.1649152338573456
Mr Böge was responsible for some invaluable work on this committee, and it is a relief to see that the job of monitoring the work of the BSE Committee in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has fallen to him: he is the one with the experience.	1.260544088874383
I would have liked my speech to be part of a discussion that would have also treated the second part of the Commission' s proposal.	1.2685043720763025
I do not think it appropriate to have to conduct in part the same discussion when Mrs Roth-Behrendt' s report from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is featured in the plenary session.	1.071618101716185
In the previous speech Mrs Schierhuber said that scrapies is an insidious disease.	0.8895120489890941
It is indeed.	0.7349331511833973
For me as a Finn, and a member who has been active in matters concerning agriculture and the health and transportation of animals, it is most important that those EU states where TSEs do not occur at all will in the future too be guaranteed the right to inspect as fully as is necessary the transportation of live animals.	1.3416207263282238
I wish to stress how important it is for us to remain free of disease.	1.0896346320713794
The possibility, if necessary, of having additional inspections of animals in these areas is not a question of artificial protectionism or the restriction of freedom of movement, as there really is justification for it.	1.2064622934307543
The inspections must be seen as being fair and cost-effective action to promote the wellbeing of animals and prevent increased expenditure for the EU.	0.9875949757671431
On behalf of the European Liberal Democrats, we can support the Commission' s proposal on Mr Böge' s report, but in the forthcoming debate on Mrs Roth-Behrendt' s report we must look again at the position of those countries where TSEs do not occur.	1.4948855277646698
Mr President, I too would like to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur.	1.2906534360135768
There is no doubt that Mr Böge and the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment are now tremendous experts in this field.	1.2766204444137264
It is very good that they are continuing to monitor this issue on behalf of Parliament because it is extremely important.	1.4521880246870726
Regardless of the many other concerns we may have, BSE has given us a terrible legacy that has to be dealt with and resolved.	1.192122063358988
It is quite clear that the incidence of scrapie in sheep has been a contributing factor to the overall problem.	1.0452528194038515
I welcome the legal base being set and the comprehensive way the new rules will, I hope, address this situation.	1.3379626689146338
We must ensure that nothing can enter the food chain or the animal compound feed to allow what we have experienced in the past to happen again in the future.	1.1486026106903013
No-one would want to see what happened to farmers with BSE happen ever again.	1.195749335522218
We have to bring in the most stringent rules and we have to make them work.	1.7517101802191795
It is extremely important both for the producer and the consumer that we restore confidence and the only way we can do it is by rigorously tackling the problem and resolving it.	1.3009780006810059
BSE has certainly not gone away.	0.6669134075807593
You can see it in different countries.	1.0533545399339652
I do not want to point the finger at any particular country, but many countries are now facing similar problems to those we have had in the United Kingdom.	1.3268896890717572
It will be there for some time to come.	1.2204903774884284
We have to ensure that the whole system of traceability, of following the animal from birth until slaughter and right through the whole food chain, is part of that confidence-building mechanism.	1.3649796178557965
If we are not able to achieve that then we will have tremendous trouble in the future.	1.2153317678917204
Finally, I have certainly believed for a long time, coming from an agricultural background myself, that if we had fed the animals the proper food and if the animal feedstuffs had been made up of the proper compounds we would never have had BSE in the first place.	1.295882726627571
It was never the responsibility of the farmer, it was the food compounders who caused this problem and we have to ensure that it never happens again.	1.353025322635126
. Mr President, I am pleased to have been given this opportunity to discuss a subject where there is good cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, namely combating TSEs.	1.4615912758943983
I should also like to thank Mr Böge for his work on this issue.	1.0814252213544424
Considerable progress has been made on our proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation under Article 152 of the Treaty on the prevention and control of TSEs.	1.2344896303464241
This proposal addresses all TSE risk in all animals at all stages of the production chain.	0.9218630919198025
I am here today to listen to your opinions on the first step in this process of establishing a truly comprehensive Community system for the control of these diseases.	1.2116186456096514
I have proposed in the proposal at hand to delete all currently existing Community rules on scrapie in sheep and goats and to transpose them to the framework proposal for a regulation.	1.1758407964352464
The detailed rules would then follow in that framework proposal.	0.7926325113618259
I have been informed that you welcome this initiative, as appears from your contributions this afternoon, to formulate a single text.	1.26912887935692
I am looking forward to discussing any further improvements you might wish to suggest under the framework proposal for the legislation, especially after the reference made by Mrs Roth-Behrendt to her own report and opinion on this issue.	1.143542559856177
I look forward to receipt of that document, which will be taken into account in all further considerations in relation to this issue.	1.1522806336845215
Finally, I would say this in relation to the observation about including legislation in annexes and the observation that we must achieve an effective balance between Parliament having a full say and yet at the same time our having speedy resolutions, speedy legislation and speedy amendments to existing legislation.	1.2887776014675976
In the months I have been Commissioner and observed the way legislation goes through the system, I can see that much work needs to be done on this issue so that we can all achieve what we seek to achieve, that is, the translation of policy into legislation.	1.4182970851668497
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6737777542510281
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	0.28917441844220476
Community policy in the field of water	0.49241097993906097
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0027/2000) on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council directive on establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy (9085/3/1999 - C5-0209/1999 - 1997/0067(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mrs Lienemann).	1.1265128209196835
- (FR) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, water will be one of the main environmental and world issues of the twenty-first century.	1.0019114232034858
Climate change, global resources, river quality and groundwater aquifer quality are major challenges which threaten our common future.	0.8544415725775506
We will either be able to restore water quality to suit the planet' s ecosystem or we will experience a whole range of adverse events which will threaten the development of certain regions, the living conditions of the inhabitants of other regions and even, more fundamentally, the global balance.	1.2150336580316434
To support this statement, I would point to an excellent report drafted by our colleague, Mário Soares, in the international bodies on the state of the seas and oceans.	1.4980114583801276
When talking about climate change, we have rightly referred to the greenhouse effect and the state of the atmosphere.	1.2808120556112326
Yet we also know that the deterioration of the oceans will significantly destabilise whole areas of our planet.	0.9818703253084843
Europe must therefore lead by example to some extent, both because it must promote a certain development model and because it is itself facing serious problems of pollution and deterioration of its waters, including its groundwater, surface waters and seas.	1.164100034407975
Furthermore, Europe has signed international conventions, in particular the OSPAR Convention in which it made certain commitments.	1.5294712796199448
In this it said that in a few years' time we must have stopped dumping pollution and halted the increase of pollution and we must have reached a near zero level of toxic and dangerous substances.	1.2556351866919209
Despite having signed these international agreements, this directive and the specific policies in the field reveal that Europe cannot achieve the objectives set or must defer these for so long that the very credibility of its signature of these international conventions is threatened.	1.301219833556881
This is why in the debate on the framework directive on water policy, the European Parliament has since the first reading demanded coherence between the framework directive and the international objectives, particularly with regard to respect for OSPAR. This convergence must be effective and specific and must commit us to action.	1.4425366794077217
The European Union' s water policy is not starting from zero.	1.258312676073459
Many directives have already been adopted. Furthermore, the Commission wants to make these directives more understandable and more compatible with each other and to give them clearer objectives.	1.3392783698361566
The preparation of this framework directive is therefore prompted by a desire for rationalisation.	1.0523121730215996
However, at first reading this House insisted that the current directive should not only be compatible with the commitments made, like OSPAR, but should allow us to reverse the course of affairs.	1.5703338615692362
For despite these directives and frequent declarations about the effort which must be made in terms of water protection, when we look at the state of the environment in Europe we can see that the objectives have not been achieved.	1.3930598294252095
In many cases the situation has deteriorated and we therefore cannot settle for just rationalisation of the texts.	1.1696726229348489
We must set objectives which are equal to the challenges facing us.	0.9720412790732603
Yet we do not have much time.	0.7600723860906
We could, as the Commission has proposed, accept these overlong deadlines which the Commission and the Council have extended even further. Yet if we do, we will not only have a credibility problem with the general public, but these efforts will be postponed until tomorrow and then tomorrow they will be deferred again.	1.4693080280838908
It is clear that in this event the objectives will never be achieved.	1.1029577431160478
I am stressing this point because, when disasters are being reported daily in the news, we cannot just keep on saying for the umpteenth time that Europe did not act when it should have done. Then, in our haste, we act as if we will solve the problems which we refused to tackle properly at the appropriate time.	1.3939493125419355
The current example of the Danube and the pollution from Rumania shows very clearly that if we fail to establish a new method of economic development, clear requirements, controls and precise measures concerning the state of our rivers, this type of incident will not only occur again but will do so increasingly over time.	1.1853147953327159
It is also clear that if we do nothing, our agriculture will continue to develop in a very unbalanced manner.	1.3910250232703765
Even now, the rivers in Brittany are eutrophying and this is damaging tourism.	1.205790951527431
To conclude, the issues are clear at this second reading.	1.2933631258617286
Do we or do we not want standards compatible with OSPAR, in other words to get dangerous substances down to zero?	1.1995364953598002
Do we want to shorten the deadlines proposed by the Council for this directive?	1.2289042185233057
Do we want to have a pricing policy which enables all public and private participants to clean up and save water?	0.978720299567344
Do we seriously want to respond to the hopes of our peoples?	0.848791754122139
The majority of the amendments approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection meet these objectives. I hope they will be supported by this House.	1.1221610760104357
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Lienemann has just painted a very drastic picture of how important water and air are to us, especially as the very source of life for human beings.	1.2774272353800136
The problem is one of both water quality and water resources, of which there is not a plentiful supply everywhere in Europe, especially in very dry regions.	1.3723930082803988
I am sorry that Commissioner Wallström, who is responsible in this area, cannot be here now because this is, after all, a very, very important directive on which the Commission has been working for a long time, and water protection legislation, which we are debating now at second reading, affects all the citizens of the European Union as well as all the people in countries wishing to join, who will have to comply with EU legislation once they accede.	1.4269708723291463
We have been working on this subject for ten years and a comprehensive approach was only made possible as the result of a hearing arranged and held by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in 1994.	1.0843594813774173
A great deal of work has been carried out between then and this second reading by numerous Members of the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers.	1.1434616000772286
We reduced the 243 proposed amendments in the Environment Committee to 77, but another 30 have been added.	1.218589442357902
You see, there are numerous matters of concern here and they are all very different.	1.3027683363303209
Some want tighter legislation, some want more clarification, others want to serve national interests.	1.0877398601559998
Even within my group, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, there were, of course, differences of opinion.	0.9953633681522498
Our line is to work towards realistic objectives and practicable solutions.	1.027481410201718
In this sense, the proposed amendments tabled by me and other members on behalf of the group represent an improvement on the demands set out in the common position.	1.291930881405902
Some proposed amendments which we support should strengthen the European Parliament' s negotiating position in the forthcoming conciliation with the Council of Ministers.	1.1951239888816487
We obviously reject all unrealistic demands which affect the European Parliament' s credibility.	0.8428134144249853
For me, that includes the zero demand, i.e. the demand for zero inputs up to 2020.	1.0856484576738692
That would sound the death knell for every agricultural and many industrial undertakings.	0.7289773741597673
I should like to stress quite particularly here that we have already made considerable progress under current national and European water protection laws, however imperfect they are and however little they are complied with in the Member States.	1.362906708937232
I only need to remind you that we again have salmon in the Rhine, which would have been unthinkable 20 years ago and that salmon are due to be released this spring in the Elbe, which was particularly polluted.	1.3107269368865753
That does not mean that we do not still have huge efforts to make in order to improve water protection yet further and maintain the quality of water and ground water and this will doubtless cost a great deal of money.	1.2404571003539648
Farmers have voiced a number of concerns over the past few days.	0.9918016564036413
You can only farm if you have an adequate supply of clean water.	1.071656389883519
The line followed by our group for the negotiations with the Council of Ministers will allow an acceptable solution to be found for farmers too.	1.189168556292356
I am horrified that both Members of Parliament and the public have been misled by false arguments in this difficult and sometimes highly technical matter.	1.1290882570233234
I therefore extend my special thanks to my colleagues in the group who helped us find compromises.	0.8883540888395821
I also extend my special thanks to our rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann, for all her work and her cooperative attitude, even if we have agreed to differ on certain points.	1.2642989485233296
And I also thank the representatives of the European Commission, who stood by with advice and expert help at all times.	1.1871202285054123
If the representatives of the Council of Ministers take an equally constructive approach, then I have no doubt that together we shall find an even better solution to the problem of water protection in Europe under the conciliation procedure.	1.354885904302911
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on the excellent work which she has presented and on her efforts in terms of overcoming the differences between us with regard to water.	1.086956052089524
The framework directive on water is a necessary initiative.	1.0757974005592084
Nevertheless, given that the idea of solidarity is central to the process of European construction, this directive must take into account the fact that water resources should be seen as a factor in social cohesion.	1.3619997175933318
Nobody doubts that water is a resource of interest to all of us.	0.9997684611070934
However, in Spain and the other southern countries, which have an unusual climate, the management of water resources require political action in order to rationalise their use and other cooperative measures.	1.4885783825033918
Therefore, we believe that this framework directive should advocate a use of water which allows us to overcome territorial imbalances and, to this end, I ask that you support Amendment No 95, which has been presented by our group.	1.4826525707385478
We wish to ensure that Article 1 of the directive promotes the sustainable, efficient, fair and considerate use of water.	1.1851294192786566
I am now going to briefly discuss the main issues on which the Spanish Socialist delegation differs somewhat from certain positions which have been expressed here.	1.0664025315066021
One example is water transfers.	0.6829204861535046
We would prefer the future framework directive not to subject the implementation of transfers to Community supervision.	1.0616683727760305
We consider that, given the hydrological characteristics of Spain, where transfers of a structural nature are carried out, the authorities of the country should make decisions with regard to its own resources, and these decisions should, of course, always be taken in accordance with the quest for cohesion and the rational use of water.	1.4312819467549671
With regard to one of the most controversial points of our debate, the application of tariffs, the Spanish Socialists have been arguing, in accordance with the principle that the polluter should pay, that the directive should propose policies on accessible prices for all levels of consumption.	1.4014932885992935
In Spain, a policy of full recuperation of water costs would clearly not have the same effect as in the countries of the centre and north of Europe.	1.2616997308412174
The Spanish would see an increase in the price of water for its different uses, owing to the scarcity of water resources and the internalisation of the environmental costs which will have to be met within the framework of the provisions of the directive.	1.1493340152855442
We have therefore always argued for a progressive system of recuperation of costs. This system should take good account of social, environmental and economic effects, and its implementation should be modulated in accordance with differing geographical and climatic conditions.	1.2527870308124633
We want to build a Europe with a sustainable and healthy environment.	1.1133082491423902
However, an environmental Europe cannot, in any circumstances, be built at different speeds, but must be built from a point of view of solidarity.	1.6551684896120904
Mr President, the ecological disaster in the Danube reminds us of how closely linked all the countries of Europe are and how important water is to us all.	1.4116689657244688
Discharges from chemical factories in my own constituency in the north-west of England will end up on the beaches of mainland Europe.	0.9993565714723688
This brings home the connections which bind us together.	0.6628735290837826
This framework directive is intended to paint the broad brushstrokes of the policy for the next decades and there has been much panic over the details.	1.1313276578041664
It is important for us to remember that this is a framework.	1.375611788507586
These brushstrokes are indeed very broad.	0.632493991999506
It is easy for individual countries, for individual sectors of industry, to escape the effects which have been painted to us in recent days.	1.3437572689819273
There are many opportunities to hide.	0.9663746427977324
The reality is that the details of this legislation will be set out in daughter directives in months and years to come.	1.0854381138729365
That is the time to debate some of these problems of detail.	1.389966749423513
The broad principles are surely ones we should be able to accept - the broad principles that we wish to reduce hazardous waste leaking into the groundwater, the broad principles that we should be aiming to ensure that chemicals, which we all need in society in all circumstances, should not be finding their way into our water system.	1.3621032955704235
There is a chemical factory in the north-west which wrote to me to say that we must vote against this legislation.	1.4753413478853037
I would have to ask them what chemicals they are putting into the water supply at the moment and why they are not broadcasting to all the residents in that area exactly what they are doing.	1.342848766653693
This is something that they prefer to avoid doing.	1.0374400765816545
The principle also concerns water charging.	0.5995699845671011
The basic understanding which many of us now share is that we need to introduce environmental taxation to encourage conservation, to use the carrot-and-stick approach to make best use of our assets so that we do not add to the pollution or loss of a valuable resource like water.	1.1752377239466816
I want to refer to the political position here.	1.0227782590732257
The common position has weakened the stand taken by Parliament at first reading.	0.9878714900359057
Some of the NGOs would say that the directive as now framed is worse than useless.	1.1934192498114249
It is a retrograde step.	1.254362897818896
This is an opportunity for us to improve the situation.	1.2692250387164585
We need to get ourselves into a position of conciliation.	1.265994239927596
We have seen vote after vote lost.	0.9627115782554521
Measure after measure has come out of the Environment Committee.	1.0873115513291514
We have failed to achieve a qualified majority.	0.8062101760790391
Our attempt to improve the environment of Europe has failed.	0.9413053240594038
We need to get into that conciliation position.	1.1267809276413332
We need, at the end of the day, to ensure that we end up with a sensible, balanced policy of real improvements at a reasonable cost.	1.103852551888689
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as long as nearly thirty years ago, the European Commission made attempts to draw up a European water policy.	1.2489375633632533
A hundred and twenty-nine chemical substances had to be regulated.	0.7710297932400318
Eventually, standards were drawn up for only a dozen or so substances.	0.9231067704903192
The unanimity principle was at the root of this debacle.	0.861258728935583
Some seven years ago, it still looked like the European water policy was going to be sacrificed on the altar of subsidiarity.	1.153000735408038
The conservative government leaders Messrs Major and Kohl decided in a cosy fireside chat at the Edinburgh Summit that it was totally unnecessary for the Spanish to receive drinking water supplies which were as good as those of the Germans or English.	0.9967495225236758
This sentiment is partly reflected in the common position which came about under British Socialist Presidency.	0.964063735367033
That position is like holey cheese, or to keep it the sphere of water, as leaky as a sieve.	1.2621696277365937
It explains the ground swell of amendments which were tabled by the Committee on the Environment: nearly one hundred amendments for the second reading.	1.172259587132867
This is unusual, but most of these amendments are desperately needed to plug the holes.	1.180405004041414
The dangerous chemical substances constitute a big leak.	0.6799861783183241
The chemical industry and, unfortunately, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers too want to draft a separate risk analysis for each dangerous substance.	1.1595595467093027
This is very time-consuming, and, more importantly, there is no acceptable level of pollution for dangerous chemical substances.	1.256425231103795
Only the background level of the ocean is acceptable.	0.9306077839232131
This is what is meant by the term "close-to-zero" .	1.0241642672538867
The Commission already has a list of 32 priority substances, many of which have a hormone-deregulating effect.	1.1477996951198353
These are so-called endocrine disrupters and cause, even in extremely minimal quantities, changes in the gender of animals and even humans, as is more and more being ascertained by scientists.	1.219901425721312
This is why it is so important that the European Parliament declares itself openly in favour of the OSPAR objective of close-to-zero by the year 2020.	1.3100597796364746
I would like to mention two substances from the Commission' s list: mercury and tributyl, abbreviated to TBT.	1.174332406618357
On the bottom of the Wadden Sea, the values of mercury and TBT are higher than the OSPAR value, to wit, ten and one thousand times, respectively.	1.1115341293782501
The chemical industry and society as a whole have to learn to replace these dangerous chemical substances by harmless substitutes, and if this is impossible, to apply them in closed systems.	1.33739724429833
For the substance TBT, this means that it can no longer be used as an anti-fouling substance.	1.3527160075627835
A sound alternative would be to clean the ship' s sides mechanically.	1.039734100112171
I would like to finish off by expressing the hope that the European Parliament will pick up once again its green image and will argue in favour of the close-to-zero option for dangerous chemical and hormone-deregulating substances by the year 2020.	1.1896477653698248
Mr President, the European Parliament has a crucial role to play in the development of the Water Directive.	1.3448994207617584
The Council's common position is totally inadequate in a number of areas.	1.0744595620409887
Therefore, our task is to make the requirements in the directive tighter and more concrete.	1.4774298066722809
As members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, we regarded certain principles as particularly important when we adopted a position on the different proposals.	0.9983322576071162
Firstly, we think that the time-frame for implementing the proposed measures should be shorter than that proposed by the Council.	1.3905935586415297
We therefore support the proposal to reduce the time allotted for implementing different parts of the directive.	1.1240754015210543
Secondly, I should like the phasing out of noxious materials to be carried out consistently.	1.1906557556810458
There should be no initial delay to allow new evaluation criteria to be developed before the measures are implemented.	1.077468279635482
The legislation should also have written into it the fact that the international conventions, such as the OSPAR Convention must be respected.	1.248397060406877
Thirdly, we should like a clear statement regarding the pricing policy.	1.3248981759553946
This means that the basic principle must be that the price should represent the real cost of the water used.	1.4088106196202195
Nowadays, taxpayers often have to subsidise industry and farming.	0.9012897571355708
The obvious point of departure for legislation should be that polluters or consumers pay, although exemptions would be permitted in extreme cases.	1.0842882958633815
Fourthly, we should like exemptions from the rules on water status to be kept to a minimum and clearly defined.	1.3878392510036048
Fifthly, the protection of groundwater status and measures against persistent pollution of the groundwater should be transparent and clear.	1.1356452122218057
Against that background, our group is able to vote in favour of most of the amendments tabled by Mrs Lienemann, the rapporteur, as adopted in committee.	1.3261511138170397
We should like to see the scope of a couple of points extended.	1.2993981003536954
We will therefore vote for the Greens' Amendments Nos 102, 103 and 104, which we consider to be improvements on the present position.	1.3408860921223256
As regards pricing policy, there are sometimes extreme cases which may require derogations from the principles laid down in the report.	1.1495373870042
My own view is that the options for allowing derogations had already been given proper attention in Amendment No 43, tabled by the committee and been even more clearly set out in the Greens' Amendment No 105.	1.20636675491001
I cannot see any need for other derogations besides those specified in the two amendments just mentioned.	0.9957447277953162
However, some people in our political group think otherwise.	1.675841201632575
Consequently, Amendment No 107, on the same question, has been tabled by one section of our group only.	1.650311372729658
On the whole, I welcome the committee's proposals set out in Mrs Lienemann's report and think they could provide a good basis for a hard-won compromise.	1.258602679114458
Mr President, every satellite photo proves that we do indeed live on the blue planet, yet the abundance of water is an illusion.	1.3391909590846223
The recent disaster on the Danube serves as a reminder that our rivers are the lifelines of our planet and that pollution does not respect borders.	1.0473102117923758
Water is a renewable but limited natural resource.	0.5519699355199346
It becomes scarcer when it is mismanaged and when the geographical and climatic conditions are unfavourable.	0.9474477341937174
In the EU, this is a crucial issue in the Mediterranean region and also in other European countries where we are witnessing the gradual drying of wet areas.	1.4726522057015499
The increase in vulnerable areas, both wet and dry, inequalities between countries, inequalities between different regions within countries and unusual climatic, economic, geographical and geological events are all the evidence we need. However, these must not lead to competition distortions within the Community.	1.232782655360112
We have therefore tabled amendments to highlight the importance of the special relationship between agriculture and water, given that water is an essential factor in the occupation and development of the land.	1.3800964367214799
Agricultural needs are clearly much greater in the south and this specific point must be taken into account in the framework directive.	1.324777108566123
It is not only in the Member States that solutions to these problems are being sought. Last October in Turin, the countries in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership bluntly demanded a Marshall plan for water for the south coast of the Mediterranean.	1.38425535585278
We are not, fortunately, at this point.	1.3815595092858686
However, we are in Europe experiencing droughts and desertification in certain regions and also floods, which the directive underlines.	1.5049941636509567
For example, France, the Rhine valley and central Europe recently suffered flooding.	1.1666005582613292
We need this framework directive as an essential element of a sustainable development policy which must make the various uses of water compatible with each other.	1.227342992948485
Yet we also need to integrate the protection and conservation of biodiversity into this new management of water.	1.1100412936666875
The water issue will definitely not be settled today.	0.833678565793266
In fact, the problems of enlargement and climate change will offer new prospects.	1.2033450827615255
Mr President, it is very likely that, during this century, good-quality water will be of even more strategic importance than oil.	1.5361674626601034
This is enough reason to thank Mrs Lienemann for the efforts she has made to obtain sound surface water.	1.1001924388003055
It seems rather complicated to attain a proper European legislative framework.	0.7617444197994939
With the framework directive on water policy, we are hoping to end the fragmentation of the EU' s water legislation.	1.242925330273635
But that has not dismissed us from the task of drawing up an extensive and complicated directive which will require great care in its implementation from the executive bodies.	1.1243097148395647
More specifically, the possibilities for adopting a specific policy by Member States and water boards, which have been set up thanks to the catchment basin approach, need to be maximised.	1.1907458854597397
The key goals remain the prevention from further pollution of ground and surface water, the protection of eco systems, the promotion of the sustainable use of water, the control of floods and droughts and the termination of discharging dangerous substances into surface water.	1.1399012527345294
As far as the discharge of these dangerous substances is concerned, I am of the opinion that the Councils' objectives lack both commitment and ambition.	1.204541493696118
The Committee on the Environment' s present proposal to reduce discharges to close-to-zero is, in my view, to be welcomed and worthy of emulation.	1.4327581315418807
However, a great deal of attention must be paid to its viability.	1.4569665167720134
Consideration must then be given to natural background emissions which cannot be influenced, as well as diffused emissions which are difficult to control, and which pollute the water quite substantially.	1.2264412092950137
Mr President, we need to get used to the idea in the 21st century that we have to show water a completely new respect.	1.4143207415292534
In the 20th century, water was merely a free evacuation and disposal system for poisonous substances, special waste, chemicals and so on. And we can already see the consequences!	1.2078180243850423
We need to rethink and recognise that water is our most important asset and that our responsibility towards it goes far beyond the present generation.	1.0379435838646536
The directive must be negotiated accordingly and our citizens must be able to understand what we or rather what the Commission is planning here.	1.2562505606463468
In the final analysis, water protection is not just a social question, it is a decisive social question, which is why the polluter pays principle must be applied more rigorously as otherwise we all bear the consequences.	1.3574340073859652
Given the advanced state of pollution of water resources, it is important not just to maintain the status quo but to ensure during the vote tomorrow that we achieve genuine quality improvements.	1.2485979491651313
Mr President, it must be some six years ago now that Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz, assisted by Mrs Ursula Schleicher, put in a request and managed to overhaul the water policy in its entirety.	1.2061441651626568
It is not an easy topic and, in my opinion, the efforts made by Mrs Lienemann are very laudable indeed.	1.4280476379949065
The decision-making process concerning this framework directive on water has reached a crucial stage.	1.1292598968835654
The topic has been brought under the codecision procedure and as a result, we have been able to draft important, more stringent legislation as early on as at first reading.	1.2389592555332833
In fact, the common position which was issued at the end of last year was already a major improvement on the original proposal.	1.2374838716165302
It is also very hard to adopt policy in this respect because the discrepancies are so huge.	1.421308950716513
I would also address the Spanish Member in this respect: in the North of Europe, we often face floods, but also polluted water, from industry, whilst the problem facing the Members in the South is often related to transporting water over long distances, simply to supply drinking water or water for agriculture.	1.4929019951824776
I would like to enter into the two elements of this topic in more detail.	1.062702783656536
I would first of all like to focus on quality.	0.8646981600390162
The Netherlands is significantly affected by the European water policy.	1.0214670263552068
A very important component, to wit, one third of our drinking water, is extracted from surface water in the Netherlands.	1.3963355071896824
The Netherlands is located downstream, in a delta, which means that the quality of the surface water which heads our way is of key importance.	1.3221028657925837
Another important point of discussion is the standardisation of water quality.	1.0318635243555845
In a number of amendments, the proposed standards and especially the OSPAR standard for 2020 are called into question.	1.0799635857273566
Although I understand that, according to some, this standard is unclear or that it cannot be defended judicially, I do believe that we have to support it because we could then provide more precise standards in a conciliation procedure.	1.56054074569872
I would now like to say a few words on quantity management.	0.8013487620088526
In his poem "Herinneringen aan Holland" [ "Reminiscing about Holland" ], a famous Dutch poet mentioned water too, which, with its never-ending trail of destruction, was feared and respected.	1.3570924311823676
In 1953, we suffered an enormous flood at a time when we were able to play a pioneering role in terms of dam technology.	1.149463370460089
When our rivers flooded in 1990, we established that installing artificial works upstream affects the water-storage capacity downstream and can cause a great deal of damage.	1.059457731890089
This means that in terms of quantity management too, we need to put in considerable effort to ensure that life upstream and downstream is not affected by it.	1.1918390686038034
Mr President, I too would like to start by congratulating Mrs Lienemann on her excellent work.	0.8891878828115188
Water is a basic necessity of life and a fundamental right.	1.2352777345994372
Everyone should have clean water at their disposal but the availability and good quality of water is not so self-evident, as many have experienced in Southern Europe and are experiencing now in the Danube countries too.	1.376275630739144
Water is often a source of conflict between countries and peoples.	0.9171609481921009
This is why it is important that water becomes subject to international coordination.	1.1795978323004501
We need to recognise that water is a joint liability.	1.1537325583076865
Cooperation within a catchment basin must be self-evident.	0.6555479478015335
Too little operational capacity upstream or, in fact, excessive use, can cause problems downstream.	1.2079076664058348
Coordination is the key word here.	0.9271724444398325
The problem of water is becoming increasingly topical.	1.1435606901855198
Changes in the climate and minor rises in temperature have a direct impact on precipitation.	0.8181609313975227
Some areas are becoming drier, whilst many are becoming wetter.	1.0239828145463432
It is time for action.	0.995521343522637
In March, the Second World Water Forum will be held in The Hague.	1.327209968031481
This Forum stands for a worldwide vision.	0.6660959488975893
This vision must translate into regional action plans for sustainable water management and water control.	0.9004105498342605
The time for action is upon us.	0.9707383685756478
The European Parliament must now opt for a sustainable water policy as a starting point and remain realistic at the same time.	1.1627498758675616
But we should not lower our standards too much either.	1.0047835712675734
The common position is not ambitious enough.	1.0696002637283268
This is why it is necessary to refer to previous international agreements, or the OSPAR objectives.	1.2313831676951268
We need to aim for dangerous substances to be phased out by 2020.	1.0347476590977562
This has been agreed for the marine environment and it is obvious that this agreement will also apply to other waters too.	1.209958255093612
The OSPAR objectives are now being drawn up.	0.8850932130424225
A list has been compiled, containing 400 substances which produce clear risks for the environment.	0.9447183313355902
It is both technically and economically possible to reduce the emission of these substances to virtually zero and we need to opt for this once again.	1.0228663896751848
Needless to say, the directive also needs to be binding.	1.0057009155460115
Countries downstream must be able to count on the fact that countries upstream meet the quality objectives.	0.9629958910918606
Quality has a price, but pollution could well have a much higher price tag in future.	1.1985098979017728
Mr President, Commissioner, my compliments to Mrs Lienemann on her excellent work on the Water Directive.	1.087998108556692
I should like to remind you that the very serious environmental problems facing us today in the shape of climate change, the depletion of primeval forests and overfishing, constantly affect our common and vital but, in some ways, unowned resources.	1.2550582576410068
We should also recognise that, in Europe, our fresh water sources may be said to be on the borderline between being owned by everyone and by no-one.	1.247612121521256
It is therefore strategically important that responsibility for water is established.	1.1558824708397781
It is also important for the different watercourses to be kept together and managed as the totality they in fact are, irrespective of who owns one section or another of a common watercourse.	1.2339988649579874
Ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive does indeed, as many speakers have already said, represent an historic chance to simplify and improve the jumble of piecemeal EU regulations and directives and achieve a high level of environmental protection in Europe.	1.2008113735436163
However, I have the impression that the policy in the water framework directive is geared towards deregulation and renationalisation.	1.4032617041401643
I also hope that the vote will not be a washout and that will depend on what I see as two quite fundamental points.	1.3837972540678174
First OSPAR.	-0.0
We know that the Commission proposal does not go far enough; unfortunately this also applies to the proposal by the Committee on the Environment.	1.2826625100197915
Merely pulling proposals out of the air is not enough.	0.8581123496459125
What we need is a completely legally binding objective for OSPAR.	1.1133733827339423
Only then will we manage to achieve legal clarity and, more importantly, objectives which are enforceable under the law.	1.0314267692279995
Anything else will fall short of the mark and will not help to prevent ecological disasters, such as those which have just come to light in Romania and Hungary, from happening to us.	1.2334038701872903
I find it unfortunate that national governments are not prepared to stand up for legally binding protection, despite having agreed internationally on OSPAR.	1.1014684939804373
But I think that this is exactly what we have to make up for here in Parliament, in order to demonstrate that we will not allow the credibility of our policy to be lost or compromised.	1.4298228559433077
It is also important to reinforce the polluter pays principle because prices must speak the ecological truth.	1.0528410358928173
We must not bow down before the agricultural or chemical industry lobbyists; on the contrary, we must use our vote to promote and express that fact that we want the polluter pays principle and, hence, cost-covering prices.	1.3726806552113786
Water is our most important resource and we must use our vote to ensure that the incentives and pressure are there to really comply with the OSPAR convention.	1.0736867891429938
With closed production circuits this is possible; anything else would water down the directive.	0.858560662821646
Let us grab our chance.	0.45061075119966904
Mr President, in the small amount of time allotted to me, I would like to welcome the Mrs Lienemann' s report and remind the House of three principles, to which all other principles must be subordinate, which are clearly expressed in the rapporteur' s amendments: water is not a commercial product, but the property of all the peoples of the Union; the ultimate objective is to eliminate all pollutants in surface water and groundwater, and to inform the public so that it can participate in the recuperation of water and not use water excessively given that it is such a precious commodity.	1.5070772990559682
I know that this directive may have problems, given the differing situations of the various countries of the Union, as has already been mentioned.	1.4839336006985684
The situation in the north is different from that in the south, and different from the situation in those countries which have the problem of desert areas.	1.4844430639011372
I understand this.	0.5189914104419899
However, there are some amendments which attempt to help the countries of the south, specifically Amendment No 43 which, with regard to the recuperation of costs, also indicates that Member States must take into account the social and environmental conditions of the countries when it comes to decision making.	1.497973082198413
There are also difficulties with the issue of transfers.	1.0103543910543156
In my country - I live in the north of Spain -, there is a considerable difference between the north and the south, and difficulties arise when we have to transfer water from one place to another.	1.485373735474642
However, Mrs Lienemann' s report also says that the river basins receiving the transferred water must save and protect their water.	1.345268047666759
I know that this is a difficult report and that the differing situations of countries cause difficulties, but we must move forward with a framework directive which will prevent a repetition of what is happening on the Danube and what happened in Doñana.	1.4543361224896445
We cannot allow our European water to be polluted, Mr President, and we must produce a directive which will strengthen the political will of governments to preserve the resource of water, which is so precious to all of us.	1.3883463614378124
Mr President, my compliments to the rapporteur on a splendid report.	1.351228745034458
As an Irish Member of the European Parliament, coming from a country which has large reserves of rich water, I support the vast majority of the proposals included in this directive.	1.3331803482491307
However, I would now like to look at the areas of difference between Parliament's Committee on the Environment and the Council.	1.4241175534618413
The latter has already brought forward its common position on this matter.	0.8736402855598112
According to the Council the objective of achieving good surface water status should be secured no later than 16 years after the directive enters into force, whereas Parliament's Committee on the Environment would like to see this deadline shortened to ten years.	1.2357404905100353
I see no reason why European Union Member States cannot work to implement the key provisions of this directive in as short a time as possible.	1.1498515223785764
I now turn to the amendments to be tabled before Parliament tomorrow concerning the principle of the recovery of cost of water usage.	1.0949959343273838
The Council in its common position states that the European Union governments must take account of the principle of recovery of the cost of water usage.	1.198159274844853
No specific target date for the implementation of this principle was included in the common position.	0.9676740019537222
Amendment No 43 seeks to ensure that by the year 2010 water pricing policies in Europe must provide adequate incentives to use water efficiently.	1.1281903862687137
Moreover, an adequate contribution from different economic sectors, broken down into industrial, household and agricultural sectors, must ensure that this policy is implemented.	1.3577641558516726
Unless these amendments are supported tomorrow a strong message will be sent out that metering and water rates should be implemented for households right across the European Union states.	1.215960408589723
This is politically impractical from an Irish perspective, as indeed it would be from the perspective of other EU Member States such as Portugal, Greece and Spain.	1.1080944251342837
Mr President, I want first of all to say thank you to Mrs Lienemann for her report.	1.5579303477144277
It is here and now that we decide to what extent the EU countries are to work effectively for a cleaner aquatic environment in the years to come.	1.322882477336683
We can do this by, as a Parliament, amending the Council' s common position and showing the way forward in working for a cleaner environment.	1.3673638575249825
In its unaltered form, the present directive could, in fact, have very unfortunate and long-term consequences for the environment and for our drinking water.	1.3799178198579123
It would be to send out the wrong signals both to European industry and to the European people.	1.4820919157486228
It is crucial to adhere to a limit upon total discharges of chemicals into our waters.	0.9144182217417187
The directive quite obviously provides too extended a time frame within which time is to be spent measuring every single one of the approximately 100,000 chemicals in circulation.	1.0810983889968802
We cannot afford to wait.	0.5028597892019807
In this connection, I would ask Parliament to support Amendment No 108, in which the words "water pollution caused by individual pollutants" are replaced by "prevention of water pollution through the continuous reduction in discharges" .	1.146863647179745
We cannot delay environmental work by going into inordinate detail rather than working on reducing total discharges of hazardous substances into the environment.	0.8288494508776298
The EU' s Ministers for the Environment must therefore stand by their affiliation to the OSPAR Convention, which now already defines what is hazardous to the environment.	1.304169043146588
This Convention should be our guide in working for the clean environment which we owe to ourselves and, not least, to our descendants.	1.3279537095968703
Mr President, it is difficult to summarise the areas covered by such a large and complex directive.	1.2368405056066418
The Treaty of Amsterdam reiterates the priority criteria for prevention, for the implementation of the 'polluter pays' principle and for sustainable development through an environmental impact assessment.	1.2283436243831707
Clearly, the importance of recognising the economic value of ecological factors in setting prices and making operators accountable through the adoption of incentives for non-polluting systems, seems unquestionable in the light of events that characterise the relationship between economic development and the protection of our environmental heritage, particularly our water resources.	1.183396230974266
This situation is loudly echoed in many sectors of the economy, and especially in the agricultural sector.	1.2261138787998607
The concept of good agricultural practice has been introduced in amongst the complexity of the current relationships between agriculture, environment and water resources, and between positive and negative effects, and amongst the wide range of local realities and production systems and so on. This concept indicates which agricultural production method to use in order to satisfy the Community expectation of an environmental protection of water resources that surpasses basic standards, along with the subsequent costs and reductions in income.	1.2098596011592708
The obligation to develop and consolidate a strategy for integration derives from this notion, with the aim of keeping the management of water resources at the heart of the sustainable economic production model in the light of current conditions.	1.20152114200521
We must not, with this in mind, pursue a strategy of separating the objective of preventing a deterioration in the state of surface water and groundwater from the objectives of protecting, improving and restoring their quality, as this would create a superfluous hierarchy of priorities detrimental to the overall functioning of interventions and specific measures that target a combined approach and the use of the best available techniques.	1.2567328318422268
As regards eliminating the pollution generated by dangerous substances in the aquatic environment, an optimum approach should provide a regulation at both national and Community levels, which enables clearer identification of the various classes of bodies of water polluted as a result of human production activities.	1.2409455309297421
Finally, we need to set up a system which prepares an objective list of potentially dangerous substances, using the increased information available on their chemical, physical and biological properties, in such a way as to create an integrated model for intervention at a range of strategic levels in order to protect our water heritage, which is fundamental to us all.	1.2990244489125404
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we are to take the principle of sustainability enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam seriously, then our long-term objective must be to achieve zero inputs in our water because we need to safeguard water so that future generations do not pay the price for our water consumption.	1.327489592463726
We can achieve this long-term objective by developing measures with demanding standards.	1.066156681451706
In this respect, I fully support the amendments proposed by Mrs Lienemann to develop a reasonable approach using quality standards so that we can eventually say that, when people use water, they are not consuming it but maintaining present stocks.	1.3545940980588151
This directive contains a number of very positive elements which are worth highlighting.	0.8982861144559059
First there is wide information for and involvement by the public, a rarity in a European directive.	1.2587984238110206
Secondly, there is compulsory cooperation.	1.5874400494840315
I am glad a holistic approach to water is being taken here and that authorities in the individual national states and beyond the borders of the national states are at last obliged to work together and ensure that water is of a high quality.	1.369750881529168
Thirdly, I should like to address the question of the timetable.	1.3019654642621934
I am firmly convinced that we need a strict, tight timetable in order to work towards our long-term objective.	1.2326213859461939
Compare it with what happens in December.	0.891008299957522
We all know in December that Christmas Eve falls on 24th December and we start buying presents.	0.9731430763173348
But what would we do if we knew in December that Christmas was in thirty years' time.	0.9134031466628136
We all know what we would do, which is why we need a tight timetable for our water policy.	1.4256368332118607
I emphatically support the rapporteur' s proposals and think that we need a tight timetable for all areas of the directive, from the list of measures to the question of employment measures.	1.3084081145575475
Mr President, the purpose of the present objective ought to be to ensure that the Member States work together to protect groundwater, drinking water and surface water and that the level of protection corresponds to existing EU environmental legislation.	1.3069332240473004
May I take this opportunity to remind you that previous resolutions concerning the Nitrates Directive have still not been implemented in all Member States, in spite of the fact that there is a common EU resolution.	1.1840697599526275
The present proposal tightens up the protection of the aquatic environment in a number of ways which exceed our current environmental objectives.	1.0130752037314525
It is proposed that a target should be achieved for concentrations in the aquatic environment which is close to the background values for naturally occurring substances and close to zero for humanly produced synthetic substances.	1.0042874834996989
This cannot be done, and it also, in any case, goes against nature.	1.4016462975879045
Adopting this report would have serious consequences for agriculture in the EU if concentrations of, for example, phosphorus and nitrogen could not exceed the background values for these substances in the aquatic environment and if a limit of zero were to be established for pesticides in the aquatic environment.	1.1143373684575446
European agriculture would not, for example, be able to grow bread grain with a high enough protein content for it to be used for making bread.	1.3726762628269051
As a result, agricultural production would move to other countries outside the EU, with consequent high socio-economic and employment costs.	1.2517738160946463
I cannot vote in favour of the sections in the Water Framework Directive which deal with these states of affairs.	1.037777818915659
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, water is a precious raw material.	1.0186703142360807
Millions of people do not even have clean water - a absolute necessity for survival - at their disposal.	1.2960117629717784
It should, therefore, not surprise us that water is the cause of wars.	1.2034198129641867
The capitalist world too sends out its pawns in order to gain maximum control over water reservoirs.	0.8811527150768157
General interest or solidarity often do not come into the equation.	0.8373311819228326
Europe is therefore facing an arduous task; that of combining a Community water policy which is fragmented in terms of objectives and means into more coherent framework legislation.	1.0900429689849171
I have to admit that in Flanders, where I come from, we still have a long way to go too.	1.260683349039556
We were recently rapped on the knuckles by the Commission regarding this matter.	1.0754852000525814
Anyone with any sense would like to see this framework directive used as a big stick for those pursuing policies who are now failing in some way.	1.2456349924066603
The common position is in this respect a farce, a document with no strings attached and a true affront in the light of the OSPAR agreements.	1.3755446915231135
The period of implementation can even be extended up to 34 years.	0.8967323823737198
By then, my children will be older than I am now.	1.2871890492044702
You have to admit: this is a joke.	1.3669712219498196
Tomorrow, we might opt in favour of a weak and permissive framework which ruins the future of our children.	1.3528988323327484
Either we opt for the amendments of my group, of the rapporteur or the Committee on the Environment.	1.2818005803083925
I would like to finish off with this observation.	1.0444599713003089
In the past couple of months, we have witnessed a great deal of lobbying in Belgium.	1.4101473435362313
What was remarkable about this dossier was the enormous pressure from the Council of Ministers.	0.9161540842679694
In our own country, this pressure was exerted by both Flemish and Wallonian Environment administrations.	1.0944559601020942
They have opted for the weak common position in favour of our Parliament' s more drastic positioning.	1.1836849201570063
I really do wonder whether this is an approach of which the green Environment Ministers in my country are aware.	1.3453098888581358
Ladies and gentlemen, fine words are no longer sufficient.	1.0804363865471982
We need to change tack completely.	0.9718484175134632
During the vote tomorrow, we can make it clear that Europe is drafting a responsible and future-orientated water policy.	1.3705145225383741
This can only benefit our credibility.	0.8280963691349357
The debate is suspended and will resume at 9 p.m.	0.9522686322876178
The dialogue on Europe - institutional reform	0.487883834572512
The next item is the Commission communication - The dialogue on Europe - institutional reform: the issues at stake.	1.3521743141717157
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is discussing this issue right now but it will be very surprising if its work is completed today. I am basically here to speak to you, as indicated by your agenda, on a new initiative which the Commission is proposing as just one of its responses to the major challenge of institutional reform.	1.5562880154990204
This reform must involve all the actors in European construction, with yourselves as MEPs at the forefront but also myself as a Commissioner, the Council ministers and national MPs. It must also involve the officials who work in our various institutions and who are committed to and motivated by this European construction.	1.3663062507229702
This morning, in the lengthy debate which I attended with Mr Prodi, many of you mentioned the lack of democracy and remoteness of the European institutions.	1.4949664399201996
Yet it is not just a question of who does what, as one of you said very clearly and forcefully.	1.370162663893617
Ensuring that our citizens understand who does what in our various institutions is the very least we can do.	1.2143283951975978
We must also now explain what we are doing together and what we want to do together in the future, particularly with the countries which will be joining us.	1.6342703288500968
We too are concerned about this lack of democracy, and the Commission has therefore decided to launch the 'Dialogue on Europe' in order to play its part in this direct contact with the people. This initiative will be launched on the day after the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.4387802363888798
During the IGC I will have the honour of representing the Commission together with Mr Prodi and of working closely with your two representatives, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos. All the Commissioners have undertaken to use some of their time when they go to any country or region, and not just their own, which in my case happens three or four times a month, to engage in direct dialogue with the public, and not just with the élite or those in power whom we meet as a matter of course.	1.3214588511535355
We also plan to establish direct contacts in universities, schools and factories, to meet the people, answer their questions and listen to them. In this way we will play our part, as will you, in making the necessary effort and meeting the urgent obligation to reduce the democratic deficit and the remoteness of our citizens from what we do.	1.3857967243395188
We hope to conduct this initiative in cooperation with the Member States and in conjunction with the European Parliament.	1.1312461992940792
We will produce a regular summary of this initiative so that public opinion can be measured and we can adjust or reorient the work.	1.0989215814945603
We also hope to conduct this initiative in consultation with the national parliaments, local elected representatives, non-governmental organisations, socio-professional organisations and the media.	0.9607699393279496
Opinion multipliers, political groups and parties, MEPs and national MPs, elected representatives, as I have just said, local authorities or national parliaments, the Committee of the Regions, the Economic and Social Committee, organisations stemming from civil society and university and education circles will all be involved.	1.2994563322049328
Need I remind you that the European Parliament itself took the initiative on 1 February? I must again thank Mr Napolitano for organising an initial working meeting with the representatives of the national parliaments who are, of course, the representatives of the people in each Member State.	1.3132763350865855
The Commission will propose that the Member States become involved in this exercise either as part of ad hoc cooperation or a more structured partnership.	1.1745409548265267
We are setting up a media plan and close contacts with the European Union Presidency and the European Parliament.	1.317381074399885
I have indicated the conditions under which the Commissioners will play their part through public meetings and visits.	0.914708966804708
We want to encourage debate among the people.	0.9138890934797776
Without presuming to lecture you - God forbid - or even advise you, may I just point out that, when it was my honour to be Minister for European Affairs in my own country, I saw the need to establish a direct dialogue with the people? Each week, when engaging in this dialogue in each region, I realised that there was a real need for the European Union to have a face.	1.5302006224967064
I therefore took a European Commissioner, and not just the French ones, or ambassadors posted in Paris or MEPs to engage in this dialogue each week. This made me realise that people had many intelligent questions and that they needed to be respected, listened to and informed.	1.303988920005753
So this is what we are going to do.	1.1177964498798767
We will have a budget of approximately EUR 4 million for 2000 which you will hopefully approve.	1.229563756054234
Financing from the 2001 budget must also be negotiated as we want this initiative not just to be an experiment but to last throughout both 2000 and 2001. It will therefore be ongoing throughout the negotiation of the Intergovernmental Conference and the ratification process.	1.2488351344684174
We will launch this dialogue on 8 March in Brussels in the presence of 700 young Commission stagiaires.	0.9286446146553449
Your President, Mrs Fontaine, has agreed to take part with Mr Prodi and several Commissioners in this initial dialogue. I can assure you that, whenever a Commissioner intends to engage in dialogue, the most immediately available MEPs will also be able to take part in order to give their point of view and explain the work and role of the European Parliament.	1.4672622529134354
That is all I have to say for the moment.	1.4312491286161173
I welcome any questions, suggestions or proposals from the Members present.	0.8359349185131663
Colleagues, you know the rules.	1.383314045956618
You are expected to ask questions, not necessarily make lengthy statements.	1.170969301743886
You have one minute each in which to ask your question.	0.9610633828840083
Mr President, I think I also speak for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that I chair, in expressing my appreciation of this Commission initiative.	1.4891709685815693
Moreover, this initiative is consistent with recommendations made by Parliament itself in its resolution of 18 November.	1.4390273398632285
I have also heard Commissioner Barnier' s clarification of relations and links with the European Parliament during the implementation of this programme.	1.2330798108961087
If I may make a suggestion, Commissioner Barnier, would it be possible for the communication to say something more on this subject, in addition to the straightforward and slightly clinical phrase which indicates that it will be carried out in conjunction with the European Parliament?	1.4050069780975059
It would be helpful to stress this convergence of intentions and efforts because I can see a particular problem with coordination, specifically between the Commission initiative - which certainly does not only address members of national parliaments, but also members of national parliaments - and our committee' s programme. Following the working meeting of 1 February, which Commissioner Barnier referred to and which benefited from the weighty contribution of the Commission, the committee intends to take stock of developments at the Intergovernmental Conference at all of its meetings.	1.5137510941732988
We therefore hope to benefit from the capable and consistent participation of members of national parliaments at all of our meetings, and this will be a channel which will ably supplement the ones in the Commission' s initiative.	1.3108068668966038
Thank you, Mr Napolitano.	0.9698214361287371
I can confirm that our proposal is completely within the spirit of the resolution of 18 November.	1.1492352412965825
I also want at this stage to say that I was able to propose this initiative to the Commission thanks to the cooperation and understanding of my colleague, Viviane Reding. This initiative was also established in conjunction with Günter Verheugen as it involves all the major challenges of enlargement, both its opportunities and risks, and of institutional reform.	1.443255587322111
These challenges must be explained to our citizens who are concerned about them and questioning them.	1.0202461125631774
I understand your concern, Mr Napolitano, and an interinstitutional working group will be set up. Its first meeting should take place in March.	1.56483043904485
I will ensure that we go further than the rather dry terms of the Commission' s text and it will certainly be more a question of sharing the work than working in liaison with each other. I will also ensure that over the next two years we can coordinate the initiatives taken by yourselves and ourselves which will be separate but joint.	1.4057712869108963
You realise that making a success of this dialogue means work for everyone concerned.	1.0201544791514001
Mr President, Commissioner, it is music to my ears to hear you use the word 'citizen' so often.	1.0927839641790689
We are increasingly concerned in this House about public opinion. The fear of public opinion is a rather paternalistic concept but our House is what it is and we must do what we can with it.	1.343119725805906
In terms of the IGC issue, I have a specific question for you. I believe that the Court of Justice in Luxembourg is currently looking very closely at the important issue of the fight against fraud and OLAF.	1.5107431244441458
As you know, there are problems which not only concern this House but also the European officials who are also European citizens.	1.2047518827915533
Given the urgency surrounding this issue, has the Commission considered the possibility of completely changing the structure of the anti-fraud office by moving to a solution which would entail the fight against fraud, in the Member States and in the European institutions, coming under the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice?	1.262132426992783
Mr Dupuis, first of all I attach a great deal of importance in my public life to the word 'citizen' .	1.136698196775596
It is one of the most wonderful words in a democracy and must be used.	1.2135593803878397
We will conduct this dialogue with our citizens, including the most disadvantaged and those isolated from decision-making or information centres.	1.1336467477857743
With regard to the IGC and this issue of the fight against fraud, and specifically fraud against the Community budget and interests, we have retained the idea in our proposals of creating a new and specific post of a European public prosecutor. We have done this in the spirit of this House' s work and perhaps by going down the same road.	1.4969178873243736
This public prosecutor would have the authority, recognised by the EU Treaty and therefore by the Member States, to investigate thoroughly any case threatening the Community budget and interests.	1.26293264132179
We can clearly and almost clinically see that legal cooperation is now no longer enough to fight against this fraud whether it originates from inside or outside the Community. This is why we have proposed the creation of a European public prosecutor who could, having investigated a case from start to finish, then have this investigated and ruled on by the most appropriate national court.	1.2673302571909375
In reply to your second point on the Court of Justice, we have not yet established our position on the Court of Justice because we were waiting for the Dur report which was published a few days ago.	1.230401769565758
The Commission, as I have promised, will complete its proposals on the IGC opinion about the legal system and the Court of Justice within the next few weeks.	1.4916453972453105
Mr President, Mr Commissioner, the day before yesterday, there was a leading news item in the most popular Danish news programme, which I would ask you to comment on.	1.5883423064644628
The story went that an official in the Commission had apparently told an Austrian businessman that, because he was Austrian, he would possibly be excluded from being able to participate in a scientific development project together with businesses in other countries, including Denmark.	1.350067915363973
I would ask you to confirm that, if an official has said that an Austrian company is in some way excluded from participating in joint development projects, then this official has got the wrong end of the stick, and that, if he has not said this, then there is no story.	1.4847557461395269
Will you confirm what is the case?	1.3093842210899518
Mr Haarder, to my knowledge no official has been authorised to say such a thing.	1.176679672604746
My personal opinion is that it would be wrong and unfair to penalise the Austrian people, businesses and employees because of concerns prompted by the establishment in Austria of a new government coalition.	1.2268223896321324
Therefore, subject to verification which I or someone else will give immediately after this sitting, I can confirm what you have just said, that the Commission has never said or authorised anything of this sort.	1.267271423668129
Generally speaking, there are other lessons to be learnt from what is happening in Austria. I have myself suggested various possible responses to this challenge which serves to remind us all once more what we have been doing together since 1957.	1.4486390368391333
This is an economic community, of course, but it is also, primarily, a community of values.	1.554201246175665
This is why we are drawing up a Charter of Fundamental Rights which will more widely and more clearly protect our citizens on an individual basis. This is why we have Article 13 of the EC Treaty on discrimination which we proposed, in our opinion of 26 January even before the Austrian crisis, should be applied after the IGC by qualified majority rather than by unanimity.	1.2680875582977207
This is why I personally have an idea to supplement Article 7 of the EU Treaty with a new paragraph which would give the democratic warning or monitoring procedure a legal basis. Finally, this is why we have public debate.	1.4612796126966126
The only way to eliminate misconceived ideas is to offer alternatives, which brings me back to the subject of our discussion. I firmly believe in the democratic force and value of debate, particularly to fight against demagoguery.	1.4168109806729006
Commissioner Barnier, you laid great stress in your statement on the importance of dialogue with the citizens of Europe.	1.1581995644653995
With reference to the IGC, as you know, under the Helsinki decisions the Portuguese Presidency was given the specific entitlement to add to the agenda of the IGC during the course of the IGC.	1.2658934687643248
Clearly, Parliament has its own representatives present, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos.	1.1944965103136982
But would you, Commissioner, also be in a position to give an undertaking that if and when the agenda is enlarged by the Council you would report this to Parliament so that we could discuss it amongst ourselves and indeed with you, with the intention of continuing that dialogue with the citizens on which you have laid such stress?	1.4487228040198918
Mr Beazley, my answer is clearly yes but that is no surprise.	1.2601285268936073
Mr Napolitano, the chairman, and many other members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and even more MEPs in this House know that, on behalf of the Commission, I will be available to tell you how things are going as they happen throughout these negotiations, in a spirit of transparency.	1.3957657080992472
I will perhaps say this differently from Mr Tsatsos and Mr Brok who are your direct representatives but it is also probable that, in many cases, we will say this together.	1.3873546441820934
It is very important that these negotiations is not secretive with the European Parliament or the national parliaments which, when all said and done, will have their opinions to give and their positions to take in the ratification process.	1.418277202935458
This is why I congratulate Mr Napolitano' s initiative for regular joint consultation between the national parliaments of the Fifteen and the European Parliament.	1.3747368554761388
Having said that, the duty of transparency and debate starts here with regard to the reform of the institutions.	1.1977634182348231
I will therefore be available whenever you want in order to inform you of our positions and the progress being made in these negotiations throughout this year.	1.298594880461669
Mr President, firstly I would like to compliment the Commission on its approach.	1.423714505656689
I think it is extremely useful to open up the communication channels with the citizen at an early stage. This did not really happen for the Treaty of Amsterdam or the Treaty of Maastricht and this has only led to a great deal of mistrust.	1.4076815541927141
I have two questions. Firstly, you mentioned that you will start a two-way dialogue with the citizens and I am already making a start with the 700 placement students at the European Commission.	1.4593849998475001
Do you intend to address the citizens via the media as well, that is to say via the television and Internet?	1.0605388234355242
My second question is of a critical nature.	0.8931844166363339
The European Commission has just issued a proposal on transparency.	1.3585320710974174
If I compare this with the transparency proposal which pertains to legislation in the Netherlands, then the European model is vastly overshadowed by the Dutch model, and that proposal has met with a lot of criticism in the Netherlands.	1.2898193443933303
My question is really: how do you intend to organise transparency with regard to the IGC, because the present directive is not a good example of this.	1.2796863174449067
Mrs Maij-Weggen, given that we are talking about ensuring transparency in the IGC, it is clear how business will be conducted and the negotiations are starting right now.	1.3173862892988808
The group of representatives is currently meeting in Brussels and I will try to join them as soon as possible.	1.224512084990539
The documents will in the main be open working documents.	0.9331572737333492
Although the negotiation sessions which will take place throughout the year between ministers and the European Council will not be open to the media, I am committed, as I must be at this stage, to ensuring this transparency and reporting in the most appropriate arenas on these negotiations and the Commission' s viewpoint.	1.5788258035669562
I can confirm, and thank you for having asked me about this, that we will use all the most modern means, television in particular, to broadcast our public debates in each country and even across Europe.	1.3421352489697265
We will open an Internet forum and create permanent discussion forums.	0.7560245960216961
The Commissioners will undertake to respond rapidly to any questions raised.	0.9261318585583959
These are the modern means to be used.	1.322988623345089
However, I believe we must also make the effort to get as close as possible to the people.	1.3364177209347101
Although this may be a rather Utopian ideal, I want a Commissioner, when he can, an MEP, a minister to attend public debates in all the regions of Europe.	1.5580559899687219
I have evidence that this is possible.	1.0467997155953301
The majority of you hold these debates in your constituencies and regions.	0.8808104530481298
Although this may seem rather egotistical, I want the Commission, in the minds of the people, to have a face and for those people forming the Commission to be able to meet our citizens as often as possible.	1.5467429427658286
Mr President, I welcome Mr Barnier' s commitment to go to the regions, both to explain and to listen to what citizens have to say.	1.2964556392776811
I would like to invite him to my own region of Yorkshire, a major European region that is a full participant in the single European market and a major recipient of European structural funding.	1.3925292815713444
He can come with both the hats that he wears as a Commissioner.	0.8607089786042617
I would like to ask him how vigorous the Commission will be in this information campaign?	1.547098679924301
In some Member States it is not just a matter of providing information to a public that is not as well informed as it might be.	1.331168516677852
That is certainly important but it is also a question of combating the misinformation that is put around by a very active anti-European movement and anti-European organisations that exist.	1.2090266016618465
The Commission will have to be very vigorous in the responses that it puts out to some of the comments that it will be receiving as part of the campaign.	1.2712702522432289
Mr Corbett, thank you for your comments.	0.90248232516306
I willingly accept your invitation. If I have understood you correctly, you want me, when I come to Yorkshire, to talk not only about the reform of the European institutions but also the Structural Funds.	1.5343520315818238
I can perform this dual task.	0.5923008152902524
I forgot to mention my intention to go before the national parliaments, as I have already done, not only by meeting their representatives here but by going to see them in situ.	1.3055717471138595
Ten days ago I was in Westminster, so you can see, Mr Corbett, that I am not afraid of the difficulties.	1.649346627307438
Next week I will go to the Bundestag in Berlin.	0.8483701676126144
I have already appeared before the French Senate.	1.0900174913190652
Therefore, throughout this debate, whenever I can, I will go directly to see the national parliaments too.	1.5696812857558735
With regard to the dialogue with our citizens, it is not a question of propaganda or marketing, nor even of communication.	1.3206128239419463
I want this dialogue to be a real dialogue. So, after a short film objectively explaining the challenges of institutional reform, those in the public gallery can participate in an open discussion.	1.3616012555119088
I will say again that we are going to conduct this dialogue initiative through specific cooperation or a more structured partnership with the Member States. I sincerely hope, with your support, that the governments of the Fifteen will participate in this dialogue initiative in the manner which they consider most appropriate.	1.3829149980752662
Mr President, I should like to join Mr Barnier' s study group with the 700 trainees so that he has some people to discuss matters with.	1.199931699646115
It is not much fun, of course, having to discuss transparency and intergovernmental conferences with yourself.	1.4101316499494292
In connection with the Intergovernmental Conference, Mr Barnier said, during his presentation in Parliament, that social policy was not to be subject to majority decision-making but, when I look at page 63, I see that rights of travel and of residence - that is to say, the Residence Directives - ,combating discrimination, the whole of social security and the renewal of Regulation No 1408 and, with a few exceptions, of arrangements in the socio-political sphere are to be subject to qualified majority voting.	1.5403620249921488
Is not Mr Barnier nervous about penetrating the inner workings of the Member States' election processes?	1.0283454338180704
It is, of course, these issues which people go to the polls about and which lead to new majorities in the Folketing and other parliaments.	1.163796489084937
Can such matters be controlled from Brussels?	0.679858616449893
Is this an element in the radical decentralisation which Mr Prodi talked about this morning?	0.9047558745822726
I was very glad to learn last week that the Commission is giving close attention over a number of years to the concept of subsidiarity and its reference, not merely to relations between the Union and Member States, but also the Union, the Member States, regions and cities.	1.4288175156858292
I hope that in his pursuit of dialogue around the regions of Europe, Commissioner Barnier will expand upon that thought and learn from what he hears.	1.3024111879236333
Commissioner, I want to go back to one of your previous answers. In this you mentioned what I would refer to as the possibilities of protecting the EU Treaty against any risks of deviation and, in particular, the variation of penalties which may be imposed on a Member State, pursuant to Article 7, for the violation of fundamental freedoms.	1.346029487025908
Do you believe that these proposals, or proposals of this type, form part of the mandate of the IGC as defined in Helsinki?	1.2671563358632505
I do not think so.	0.7520911288814713
Are you not afraid that such penalties might get out of hand and serve to punish not violations of human rights but simple differences of opinion, unpopular opinions or deviations from the dominant European thinking?	0.9516474748596908
Yes, Mr Bonde, we will be starting this debate with 700 young people in Brussels who are going to be working in the institutions and with the Commission.	1.4218000534956028
I believe that it will be good to start this dialogue with young people who are motivated.	1.2892414929338847
In terms of social protection, I can confirm that we have made proposals about qualified majority or unanimous voting but these are regardless of ideology.	1.2524524400742336
In your country, Mr Bonde, like everywhere else, I believe people are keen for the internal market to work properly under the fairest conditions of competition and movement of goods and people.	1.3241805392288797
This will therefore be our rule.	0.8340682662608223
We are proposing that decisions on certain policies or measures involving taxation or social protection and social security should be taken by qualified majority voting when there is a direct link with the proper operation of the internal market. Our proposal is not general or systematic.	1.2687664211055938
I am well aware of the sensitivity of these taxation and social protection issues.	0.9548380030480437
I do not believe that all the national systems of social protection should be made identical.	1.3805138220074873
This has never been the case. We are simply trying to ensure, in a Europe with 30 or 27 Member States, the best conditions for the operation of the internal market without one country being able to block the other 26 or 27.	1.4884258914950892
Mr MacCormick, I agree that this dialogue must reach beyond the national capitals.	1.363056559830113
It must get as close as possible to the people, where they live and where they have their roots.	1.0784982758096662
If I said anything different I would be contradicting myself as Commissioner for Regional Policy which is one of the most specific and most visible policies for increasing employment and improving the quality of life of people in their regions. You will often hear me say that this policy does not just have one main objective of achieving cohesion and solidarity between the regions but that it is intended in addition to help people, where they live, to preserve their roots, traditions, soul and identity.	1.3824109658134318
We will therefore conduct this dialogue with the towns and regions.	1.0255008060817292
Mr Berthu, the Helsinki mandate is clear and we are working within this.	1.2905186464640555
It specifies that we must deal firstly and as a priority with the three basic issues which were left out in Amsterdam.	1.2382178547273022
It also adds related institutional questions and issues which may be included in the negotiations depending on the Portuguese and French presidencies.	1.0498025364852281
The Commission is acting correctly if, on a particular point, it believes it must add to its opinion which covers many institutional questions. I am not yet sure that we will do this on Article 7.	1.6079957901059416
However, if we do, this will not be solely in response or as a reaction to an economic situation which is sufficiently serious that the fourteen governments of the Union must mobilise together to give their response. We will also do this with regard for the future in general.	1.582950060607429
We will use all the means available to permanently strengthen the community of values which we have been building together since the founding of the Union in 1957, and even before that, on the rubble of the Second World War.	1.4266663595633295
Everything which can be done will be useful. I am sure that you and I, Mr Berthu, can at least agree on this.	1.5086167001438602
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6737777542510281
You have answered the questions precisely and also opened the dialogue for Europe that you referred to.	0.9161041018117688
You have set a very good example of time-keeping today.	1.0848789795025207
That concludes the debate.	0.19308667519260808
Question Time (Commission)	0.3763026442786636
The next item is Question Time (B5-0009/2000). We will examine questions to the Commission.	1.0782099889813532
First part	-0.0
Question No 36 by (H-0025/00):	0.6844402676938183
Subject: High infant mortality in Kosovo According to the latest UN data received from the World Health Organisation, Kosovo has the highest rate of infant mortality in Europe; almost 50% of babies born prematurely die, while the war has produced a steep rise in miscarriages and children who manage to go to term are smaller than the norm.	0.9975808093658877
In the context of the humanitarian aid provided by the Union and the efforts of its envoy Bernard Kouchner, will the Commission say what measures have been taken to safeguard the women of Kosovo's right to motherhood and the health of pregnant women, women in childbirth and babies?	1.2355628170199924
Mr President, the Commission is conscious of the very difficult situation concerning health and health facilities in Kosovo, not just for pregnant women but across the board.	1.3448754124427522
This results both from the recent conflict and from the years of neglect and lack of maintenance that preceded it.	0.9106909124116
The statistics quoted on child mortality speak for themselves and are wholly unacceptable.	0.8470640074760862
However, the situation is hardly better for other parts of the population.	1.3802960367199177
The Commission' s response has been as follows: firstly, the health sector has been a significant beneficiary of ECHO funding.	1.2963253982529308
ECHO is currently focusing on the provision of medical supplies and emergency health care, on support to institutions as well as vaccination.	1.1726346493846582
However, efforts are increasingly oriented towards the establishment of a self-sufficient healthcare system in the province.	1.3030420492970947
UNMIK has already taken a significant role in this field.	0.9986699501964869
Secondly, under the reconstruction programme, urgent intervention at the hospital in Mitrovica has already been initiated with a EUR 1 million rehabilitation programme.	1.2335461154029195
Progress is slow due to the tense relations between the ethnic groups of this divided city.	0.9573378622348259
However, the Commission is maintaining its efforts with the support of UNMIK for this project.	1.3504687946454854
We hope that one day it may become a symbol promoting the benefits of ethnic reconciliation.	1.125058075675591
Under the European Community' s damage assessment, estimated costs of the reconstruction of healthcare facilities and provision of equipment to dispensaries and health houses amount to EUR 4 million.	1.0270403461601667
The Commission is now turning to the programming of 2000 funds.	1.2563556311658515
We expect to dedicate a considerable sum to improving the healthcare system.	0.7862683493221619
The emphasis will be on long-term reforms covering health financing as well as training and procurement.	1.042117199598503
Work is already under way with UNMIK to determine an appropriate contribution from the Commission to this enterprise.	1.1794096586034568
Commissioner, this morning President Prodi, among others, stressed that the Balkans are testing our ability to act effectively, the very credibility of the European Union is on trial, and the gap between words and deeds must finally be closed.	1.478427018944647
Commissioner, do you really think that the facts we have about high infant mortality in Kosovo - the highest in Europe - and more generally the picture of human misery and destruction that prevails in Kosovo, are not already damaging our credibility and casting doubt on our ability to live up to our promises?	1.3101151373409017
Besides, Commissioner, is so-called humanitarian military intervention justified by the present picture of human destruction in Kosovo?	1.2389064875412774
Do you think that so much inaction is excusable when, on the continent of Europe itself, the right to life is at risk?	1.2948158835826489
I do not think that our reconstruction agency or the task force before it, which have been working incredibly hard in Kosovo, would regard it as an adequate description of their labours to suggest that they had been standing idly by.	1.2790256772736777
I am sure the honourable Member did not mean that.	1.340469821288347
Of course, she is entirely correct in saying that the Union' s credibility is on the line with what happens, not just in Kosovo but in the Balkans as a whole.	1.4536751771611647
I am very concerned that the assistance we provide should arrive expeditiously and in a way which can maximise our assistance.	1.2380793162052102
I would just make two points about the situation in Kosovo which we are addressing as enthusiastically as we can along WHO lines.	1.2793594694442187
First of all, I am sure that the honourable Member recognises that over the period of the 1990s the government in Belgrade underfunded the health service in Kosovo, and many Albanians found that they were not really receiving any health care at all.	1.3172099731159277
As a result of that, a parallel health care system was put in place through the Mother Teresa Society.	1.257192664673461
So what we are dealing with is not just the consequences of conflict but the consequences of years of neglect and chronic under-investment.	1.1798990414152508
Secondly, and I am sure that the honourable Member recognises this as well, some of the tragic stories to come out of Kosovo in recent weeks have not been about child mortalities during carriage of a baby, but child mortality after a healthy baby has been born.	1.2643415441853751
Those were cases in which women who during the hostilities, or before the hostilities, tragically killed their own children.	1.1152824397656456
We are dealing with a horrific story in Kosovo.	0.639918916891349
We have to work as well as we can in the health care field and in others to restore something approaching civilised standards and civilised behaviour, but it is not going to be easy.	1.3709993057173335
Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your response to the Member' s first question and the supplementary question.	1.3550614306602793
However, I still have some contacts in Kosovo who have informed me that food packages which are distributed by ECHO, among others, are often of inferior quality.	1.168986442068688
In some cases, there have been incidents of food containing insects and such like.	0.8317798688320857
Are you aware of this?	0.7663119388400025
Are you prepared to act upon it?	0.7650385839669844
This is my first additional question.	0.8374779884398664
My second question pertains to the reconstruction of the hospital in Mitrovica.	1.071217830475207
You are perhaps aware that this hospital is located in the Northern part of the city and that, given the tense situation, Albanian Kosovars do not have any access to this section at all.	1.2265737211827306
What does the Commission intend to do in order to ensure that Albanian Kosovars too can get to hospital?	0.9312283616292621
On the first question, I am going myself to Kosovo at the beginning of next month for another visit and I will certainly look into the allegation made by the honourable Member about the ECHO food package.	1.293792808214549
I have not heard that suggestion before, but it is an important point and I will certainly investigate it when I am there.	1.3887341629751822
Secondly, I do understand exactly what the honourable Member is saying about Mitrovica.	1.365767103567966
I was in Mitrovica a couple of months ago, I saw the situation there for myself.	1.4272637591578103
I had discussions with municipal leaders from both communities, including the leader of the Albanian side who had himself in the past been a doctor and was generally recognised for the medical work he had done during the hostilities and subsequently.	1.1353044913173398
So I know the very serious problems that exist in that hospital and I can assure the honourable Member that we will be doing all that we can to see that adequate health facilities are available for everybody in Kosovo, whatever ethnic group they come from.	1.3859134536106545
The particular difficulties in Mitrovica - for example, it is not just a question of Albanian patients having difficulty getting to hospital, Albanian staff have had difficulty working there - are particularly acute problems.	1.1911890284526907
We will try to address them, but it is not easy.	1.2310818165134283
Question No 37 by (H-0029/00):	0.6974754798083078
Subject: Turkish blockade of Armenia Given that the European Union is actively promoting social, economic and political relations with Armenia through the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement signed on 12 October 1999, what steps is the Commission taking to persuade the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia?	0.874822348317242
The Commission supports any effort aimed at the settlement of the disputes between Turkey and Armenia and regrets that there has not yet been any normalisation of relations between these two countries.	1.0941764512970253
In the present political circumstances it is however unrealistic to imagine that the border between Armenia and Turkey, as well as the one between Armenia and Azerbaijan could be opened without settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.	1.0953247346296549
Mr President, the Commission will be holding negotiations in the future on the accession of Turkey to the European Union.	1.4649235121264839
Will it make it a condition that negotiations can only start if the blockade is lifted because, in the final analysis, we are all neighbours and we want to cultivate positive neighbourly relations inside the European Union?	1.2334972991857558
My question therefore is this: will the Commission make this one of the conditions in order to improve future discussions?	1.3154632367547658
The key issue is to support the efforts of the OSCE Minsk group to find a settlement to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and we stand ready to help in any way we can.	1.0944436596740343
We have also been substantial contributors of development assistance under the TACIS programme to Armenia.	1.0461984960051771
Let me relate my answer specifically to the question of Turkish accession to the European Union.	0.8503922584065214
The situation of Turkey's relations with its neighbours will, as the honourable Member asks, be closely examined in the framework of the pre-accession strategy.	1.269095370464859
As stated in Agenda 2000 - and I quote: "Enlargement should not mean importing border conflicts".	1.1661641120843238
That statement could not be much clearer.	0.7978407706681657
But I repeat that the most important contribution we can make is to try to assist in the resolution of that conflict which has had such harmful economic and humanitarian results.	1.3390959749985019
Question No 38 by (H-0040/00):	0.6212740193665086
Subject: Implications for human rights of the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey Given that Turkey has recently been granted applicant country status, what is the Commission's view of the implications for human rights of the construction of the Ilisu Dam, given the massive displacement of the Kurdish and the other people of the region that will result?	1.3290327113096356
The Commission has no information regarding the impact of the construction of the Ilisu Dam on the population of the region.	1.2180173406329076
We will, however, consider raising the matter with the Turkish authorities, together with other issues concerning regional development policies in the framework of the new pre-accession strategy for Turkey.	1.3411024624482697
I have a related point.	0.9763504463769914
It concerns the implications of the dam on access to fresh water in the region as a whole.	1.0298307643854934
As you know, the dam will limit the supply of fresh water to Syria and to Iraq in particular.	0.9705546199146503
Given the extreme volatility of this region and given the very real concerns of many commentators that we will see an increased incidence of conflict, of so-called "water wars", in the coming decades, what is the Commission's view about the potential destabilisation, both in Turkey and in the wider region, that will be caused by this dam?	1.4343140204322133
Can you say whether you will indeed raise this point as well?	0.9847159233676473
We will certainly raise the point made by the honourable Member.	0.9156430871471134
We have heard anxieties expressed on that point and I will ensure it is taken up.	1.2461801793715024
There have also been considerable anxieties expressed about the potential danger to the archaeological heritage in the area.	0.9695498890575924
We will raise that, too, in the representations we make.	1.2285804224617263
A number of other hydro-electric schemes planned over the last 30 years in Turkey have raised matters of concern, such as the effect on displaced farmers.	1.0434591426377138
On the whole those seem to have been dealt with relatively satisfactorily and I hope that the same can be true of this project which - just to make the point clear - is not a project in which the Commission is participating in any form.	1.4957324321570598
Question No 39 by (H-0036/00):	0.6184671037994282
Subject: Drafting of Charter of Fundamental Rights The general public welcomes the fact that a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be drawn up. It is also to be hoped that it will meet the challenges of Europe in the 21st century.	1.0297689772579974
What are the Commission's views on the substance of the Charter? What type of rights will the Charter set out (economic, social and cultural)?	0.7393118971578216
Which citizens will it cover (those of the European Union or the citizens of all European countries with a view to enlargement? Will it cover immigrants etc.?)	0.8426367060470018
Will it set out established social rights in the European Union or will it set a broader agenda?	0.7550903031848539
What means will the Charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantees equality between the sexes?	0.6081512802432385
What are the Commission's views on incorporating the Charter into the Treaty on European Union?	0.7920208453991462
Like the honourable Member, the Commission welcomes the decision taken by the Heads of State and Government to start the process of drawing up a European Charter of Fundamental Rights. In the conclusions of the Cologne European Council the Heads of State and Government even established the broad outlines of the Charter' s content.	1.2645806866204206
According to these conclusions, the Charter must contain three categories of rights. The first category is rights of freedom and equality and procedural rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.	1.3848555109194138
The second is the rights reserved for citizens of the European Union. The third is economic and social rights, as contained in the European Social Charter and the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, insofar as they do not merely establish objectives for action by the Union.	1.3944948255983176
The Commission considers that the Convention responsible for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights must respect the mandate given by the Cologne European Council.	0.9765183940110457
Having said that, this does not mean that the Convention should be limited to a codifying role of simply compiling the existing rights from various sources.	1.0656818368895566
As I have said before in this House, the Commission is convinced that the Convention must be able, if necessary, to adapt and develop these rights in view of current circumstances, particularly technological and social changes.	1.5261372196399012
However, given the mandate and the final objective of the text to be submitted to the Heads of State and Government, this power must be exercised with caution and on a case-by-case basis.	1.2857063235632853
The rights conferred by this Charter will have at least two types of beneficiary.	0.9447527028311022
Some rights will apply to anyone present in the EU territory while others will benefit only citizens of the European Union.	1.0440503507959138
It may also be envisaged that some economic and social rights could be guaranteed only for citizens of the European Union and third-country nationals meeting certain conditions.	1.250400037183237
It is not possible at this initial stage of the process of drawing up the Charter to prejudge its content in more detail.	1.1429159458751073
However, I can confirm that the principle of equal opportunity and equal treatment between men and women will certainly be included among the rights guaranteed by the future European Charter of Fundamental Rights. This is because this principle already figures among the rights guaranteed by the EC Treaty and by secondary legislation and because it undoubtedly constitutes a common constitutional tradition in the Member States.	1.220381137522115
As I have also said before to this House, the Commission is favourable to inserting the Charter in the EU Treaty.	1.62205685797597
However, we are fully aware that the final decision on this matter will fall to the Heads of State and Government.	1.3213324078625721
The difficult part, which will fall to the Convention, is therefore to draw up an ambitious and politically significant text which can be integrated as such into the Treaties.	1.4090887544589759
In its opinion on the holding of an Intergovernmental Conference to amend the Treaties, the Commission noted that the European Council must decide during the year 2000 on the inclusion of certain items on the IGC agenda, in particular the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.	1.3880112782025633
