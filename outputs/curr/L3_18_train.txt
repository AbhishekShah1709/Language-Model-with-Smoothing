Animal models and first clinical trials using antibiotic therapy seem to support an etiological role of C. pneumoniae in coronary artery disease.	0.8982921886650582
In this paper the current knowledge of the role of C- pneumoniae in coronary artery disease is reviewed and possible pathomechanisms are discussed.	1.0825484540971337
Preeclampsia is a disorder specific to pregnancy which can affect all maternal organs.	0.8595631144732077
Cerebral involvement with the occurence of convulsions is the defining factor for eclampsia.	0.8119672696910551
The most prominent signs of cerebral dysfunction include headache, hyperreflexia, visual disturbances, confusion and/or altered state of consciousness.	0.9487338311091414
Patients usually recover completely however some patients remain disabled due to cerebrovascular damage.	0.7316618404516781
Intracerebral and subarachnoidal hemorrhage are severe however rare complications of eclampsia.	0.7320054308780213
TCD investigations regularly find vasospasm in all great cerebral arteries.	0.6927176413052369
Reversible hypodense lesions in the white matter on early CT-scans and increased signal intensities on T2-weighted MRT images indicate local edema.	0.8910410290166143
The etiology of preeclampsia and eclampsia remains unknown and its current pathophysiology is still hypothetical.	0.9140397705671423
The clinical picture may best be explained by an endothelial dysfunction with increased vascular sensivity to circulating pressure agents as well as by a structural endothelial lesion with fluid loss from the intravascular compartment.	1.0460991871214274
This article reviews the surgical treatment of chronic posterior knee instability.	0.923182970134378
The treatment rationale includes exact definition of the instability pattern ("envelope-of-motion" of the tibia) by clinical examination, arthrometry and stress radiography.	1.3173600421957505
Exact evaluation of the osseous anatomy is mandatory to identify an eventual varus morphotype.	0.9072607982279518
This osseous variant in combination with posterior/posterolateral instability should be treated by an osteotomy in every case.	0.9760749473133716
The technique of additive osteotomy to correct varus and increase the sagittal tilt of the proximal tibia is described.	0.9905970196585955
Ligament reconstruction in chronic posterior knee instability must address the posterior cruciate ligament and the lateral/posterolateral structures in many cases.	1.007913184052418
Patellar tendon grafts, quadriceps tendon grafts or hamstrings can be used for posterior cruciate ligament replacement.	0.9956618948694358
Arthroscopic or mini-open techniques may be used for graft placement, direct posterior fixation of the graft via a posterior incision is an option for patellar tendon grafts.	1.047676818632212
Bousquet's biceps plasty or Clancy's biceps tenodesis may be used for posterolateral stabilization; a biceps tendon strip can also be used for lateral collateral ligament reconstruction.	0.9440831295050491
Results of surgery are still moderate.	0.7636361512774406
In the author's series of chronic posterior/posterolateral instability, 26 cases were treated with posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and biceps tenodesis.	1.0864341281710492
Follow-up at 18 months demonstrated increased stability (mean residual posterior drawer 8 mm at 70  ° and 20 lb force) and improved knee function (33 % IKDC B, 67 % IKDC C).	1.2515279305056195
Presently, surgical treatment of chronic posterior knee instability should be restricted to centers devoted to this problem.	1.0864530555259226
This article reviews the current state of consensus reached for the diagnosis of myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy on the basis of conventional histopathological and immunohistochemical methods for inflammatory infiltrates in addition to molecular biological methods for persistence of viral genome in endomyocardial biopsies.	1.0220277758054506
Health policy in Germany has in recent years given priority to the self-administration of physicians, sickness funds, and hospital associations.	1.0194307756082228
Hence, legal regulations on quality assurance have focused on defining responsibilities and areas of primary importance, while precise processes are being defined by the self-administration.	1.0308692691234147
As prices for health care are increasingly restricted by lump sum payments, quality and quality assurance become more important as a factor in competition between health care providers.	1.005064610318709
To support the implementation of quality assurance in the health care system, the German Federal Ministry of Health has funded model-projects, e.g., to support the adaptation of successful strategies of total quality management for health care.	1.1617128343048915
The research field of tissue engineering combines cells biology, biomaterial science, and surgery.	1.0363186162243232
Major long-term goals are tissue and organ replacement therapies using the patients' own cells.	1.115397729740331
Our work is focused on the treatment of severe joint defects and on plastic surgery using in vitro engineered cartilage tissues.	0.93355802723732
The practical approaches in cartilage engineering face problems with three-dimensional cell distribution or cell immobilization raising biocompatibility problems.	0.8156805692003571
The tissue engineering of cartilage is based on combining biocompatible cell embedding substances such as fibrin, agarose, alginate, hyaluronic acid and fiber fleece scaffolds of poly -hydroxy acids (PLLA/PGLA).	0.8490023516936247
Different technical approaches were established: a) three-dimensional in vitro cultures of chondrocytes for the development of vital tissue transplants and b) interacting three-dimensional cultures consisting of different cell populations, such as BMP-transfected mesenchymal cells.	1.0353319470470268
The preshaped artificial tissue constructs were cultured in perfusion chambers to maintain a stable diffusion of nutrients during the in vitro pre-formation step.	0.9146317090124121
Subsequently, pre-formed tissues were implanted into nude mice and into 4mm articular joint defects of rabbits.	0.8675510484941352
Transplants were found to produce cartilage typic morphological patterns and matrix.	0.9218382157014755
80% of the transplants remained stable in vivo.	1.0422776664113529
However, 20% of the tissues are resorbed or replaced by a fibrous tissue.	1.2884176705747974
These results demonstrate that current artificial cartilage transplants are already feasible for plastic reconstruction.	0.7374131615443481
The treatment of severe joint defects, however, faces additional problems which are addressed in ongoing studies: (a) the fixation of engineered cartilage in joints, (b) the protection against chronic inflammatory degradation, and (c) the required enormous mechanical stability.	1.2114297732503994
Background: Silicon-rubber central venous catheters have become commonplace in the care of premature infants.	1.0784616174307065
We report on a rare complication, fracture and cardiac embolization of a silicone-rubber catheter and its interventional retrieval.	1.1069523733205184
The ARO multicenter study intended to show clinical and radiological differences with regard to different systems of fixation and designs of the prothesis in total hip replacement in patients with hip dysplasia, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.	0.9725240714092624
In 1987 and 1988 5255 total hip prothesis were implanted by the 24 hospitals which took part in the study.	0.8681162842834451
3133 prothesis (95,6 %) were clinically and radiologically examined.	1.119530423320582
The follow-up period averaged 6.9 years.	1.289217641649995
The results of the Aro multicenter-study showed that despite difficult preoperative conditions especially in cases of rheumatoid arthritis the satisfaction rate improved remarkably.	0.9704793945922604
During the operation less complications arose in comparison to patients with hip dysplasia and osteoarthritis.	0.9163102156273876
Regarding the rate of infection after operation there were no differences between the 3 groups.	1.146634745378507
Only the rate of postoperative luxation concerning rheumatoid patients turned out to be twice the number of the others.	0.9804012519524681
In our opinion this is due to the fact that these rheumatics were operated by posterior approach.	0.9428165098963058
Patients with rheumatoid arthritis were satisfied most with their surgeries.	0.7180477864564606
Results of rheumatic patients according to Harris hip score were slightly worse than the results of the two other groups.	1.0438586279433821
This was due to systemic involvement and bad preoperative function of the hip.	0.8650084015867087
As a result of the study there were no differences in using cemented or cementless techniques for rheumatic hip replacement.	1.1393041605011798
The decision for the method of fixation should depend on the patient's ability to relief the prothesis after operation.	1.03953553336542
The study has shown that cementless implantation can also be used for young rheumatics provided that a suitable design of prothesis will be selected.	0.9254499627595592
Sepsis developing on the basis of a postoperative infection is a rare, but life-threatening event.	1.1503576337900847
Early diagnosis of postoperative complications usually facilitates decisive intervention and a favorable prognosis.	0.9928801244252344
If the right moment is missed, endothelial damage leads to the release of inflammatory mediators and generalized systemic infection (SIRS).	0.8911362126601566
For the subsequentially developing septic shock, often combined with multiple organ failure (MOF), it is not important whether the starting point was an uncontrollable infections focus, ischemic damage following hypovolemic shock, or massive bacterial translocation with postoperative bowel obstruction.	1.0556536649220176
The collapse of the immune system results in immune paralysis and explains the inability of the organism to defend itself against systemic infections.	0.8577275163624063
For early recognition of the developing septic complication and its effective treatment, pathophysiological and clinical issues are discussed.	0.8636066335497962
The comparison of prediction of mortality and sepsis by different score systems was the objective of this retrospective study in 51 patients.	1.1558839793684221
Specific scores for burned patients - "Abbreviated Burn Severity Index" (ABSI) and the "Baltimore Sepsis Scale" (BSS) were compared with the general intensive score systems: "Mortality Prediction Model" (MPM II), "Simplified Acute Physiology Score" (SAPS II), APACHE II (ApII), "Hannover Intensive Score" (HIS) and the sepsis score developed by Elebute and Stoner (ES).	1.3693819791482864
On days 1 and 3 the true-positive ratio (sensitivity) was plotted against false-positive ratio (1-specifity) for each score.	1.1691790361981247
The area under the curve (max.	0.7193999772067945
0.5) correlates with the quality of the score system.	1.1302116481287243
We also tested the discrimination of septic and nonseptic patients by using the different scores.	0.9747994265628627
Bilateral symmetric changes in the cerebral hemispheric white matter are found with increasing frequency using CT and MRI techniques.	0.962459088627328
These unspecific canges of the white matter signal are often called leukoaraiosis.	0.7272067003034857
They differ from the normal white matter signal.	0.7729157356544248
These changes are found with increasing frequency in persons older than 60 years and also patients with dementia and cerebrovascular diseases.	0.981437835719737
The pathogenesis, clinical significance and morphological substrate are unclear.	0.9051230550442381
The aim of this review is to summarise the actual knowledge about the etiology and clinical signs and symptoms found in patients with leukoaraiosis.	1.1658565132372163
This term should not be used when white matter changes are found in patients younger than 35 years, with an unilateral onset, asymmetric distribution, and extensive changes all over the infra- and supratentorial white matter area.	1.1772069075681284
Neuroradiological and clinical criteria are given to differentiate between leukoaraiosis and diseases of the white matter, especially enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces, lacunar infarction, subcortical arteriosclerotic angiopathy (Binswanger's disease), leukoencephalopathy of different origin, and demyelinating diseases.	1.0820719629202995
A case with various skeletal abnormalities, soft tissue masses and skin lesions diagnosed as Proteus syndrome is reported.	0.9633010224196499
Proteus syndrome is included in the differential diagnosis of many disorders, because of the polymorphous nature of its clinical manifestations.	0.9366271062198971
It is a rare disorder and leads to functional disabilities as well as cosmetic and psychological problems.	1.1448580797634462
Early diagnosis and careful follow-up with appropriate surgical interventions is important in preventing long-term complications.	1.1497180331344445
The value of elective PTA in stenoses of the supraaortic vessels and especially of the carotid artery is still under discussion.	0.8957410064023893
Stenoses after surgical and/or radiation therapy and a high cardio-vascular risk for a surgical procedure, however, justify minimal-invasive techniques.	1.2052204308295562
Profiles of fundamental frequency sound pressure levels and voice duration are measured separately in clinical practice.	0.8015061146185297
It was the aim of the present study to combine the two examinations, in order to estimate the relationship between pitch, sound pressure level and voice duration and to develop a new computer-assisted graph.	1.0658622688666695
A three-dimensional (3D) wireframe phonogram was constructed based on SPL profiles to obtain a general view of the parameters recorded.	0.9289463516917148
We have termed this "phonetography".	0.6254498639845337
Variable further projections were selected for the analysis of different aspects of parametric relationships.	0.8138985290777337
The results in 21 healthy volunteers and 4 patients with hyperfunctional dysphonias demonstrated that there were three typical figures of the 3D phonograms produced, depending on the relationship between voice duration when soft ("piano") compared to loud ("forte").	1.20336290570278
In one-third of the healthy volunteers, the values of the piano voice duration were greater than those of forte for almost all pitches examined.	1.0451506132889234
In two-thirds of the healthy subjects the values of forte voice duration were partly greater, as were those of piano voice duration.	1.0160519026677268
All of the patients showed voice duration values greater for forte than for piano.	1.062187949355259
The results of the study demonstrate that the 3D phonogram is a useful tool for obtaining new insights into various relationships of voice parameters.	1.0929102169415126
Sinus histiocytosis is as a rule a benign disease of lymph nodes, infiltrated by large histiocytes.	1.0567854097867069
These cells show typical cytophagocytosis, particularly lymphophagocytosis.	0.9072856053022103
Other organs may be also involved by this disease, often including the skin.	0.9498639234245574
Exclusive cutaneous sinus histiocytosis without infiltration of lymph nodes seems to be very rare.	0.9919579867986823
To exclude other non-X histiocytoses or histiocytosis-X, it is advisable to use immunohistochemistry.	1.028667803555849
We report on a patient with sinus histiocytosis and discuss the problems of differential diagnosis.	0.9877527615897688
The case of a five-year-old girl with intractable fluor vaginalis and recurrent perianal fistulas is reported.	0.9788655537233446
A presacral dermoid cyst was shown to be the cause of these symptoms.	0.9485747853883649
Extensive radiological investigation revealed the cyst and the associated fistulas extending into the perianal region and the vagina.	0.8255208551785332
After verification of the anatomical situation, an uneventful surgical procedure was carried out.	1.161798851209414
Positron emission tomography (PET) is a noninvasive functional method for the study of solid tumor perfusion, metabolism and interaction with different therapeutic agents.	1.0231149024694328
The aim of the study was the investigation of the metabolism of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and the kinetics during a treatment with intratumoral ethanol by PET.	1.1195450732181287
The ongoing study includes seven patients with child A cirrhosis and HCC (UICC stage III-IVA; tumor size 3-6 cm).	1.0265841829636149
Dynamic PET studies (60 min) with 18F-fluordeoxyglucose (FDG) were performed prior to therapy to assess tumor viability.	1.2619051540586843
The evaluation of the FDG data demonstrated a liver-equivalent uptake in six of the tumors (well and moderately differentiated HCC), which were poorly delineated against the normal liver parenchyma.	1.1788401532632267
One moderately differentiated HCC showed an increased FDG metabolism, indicating no correlation between histology and metabolism.	0.9709356656298147
A dose of 37-80 MBq 11C-ethanol was applied together with a nonlabelled therapeutic dose of the drug via a puncture needle positioned under sonography.	0.9732153409179968
Five out of seven tumors demonstrated a high 11C uptake shortly after the end of the ethanol injection followed by constant 11C-ethanol concentration during the whole study period of 45 min.	0.9798296274135978
The PET data demonstrated no significant elimination of the 11C-ethanol from the tumor and no accumulation in the surrounding liver tissue.	1.0523396385568216
One case showed a decrease of the intratumoral 11C-ethanol concentration due to a punkture of a tumor vein, and in another case the surrounding liver parenchyma demonstrated significant 11C uptake in the early phase following paratumoral injection of the drug.	1.21614039178687
In conclusion, PET is a useful tool for the study of the mechanism and the kinetics of percutaneous intratumoral ethanol injection of HCC.	1.150018133994826
During the last decade, many investigations were conducted in order to understand the mechanisms involved in the development of acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).	0.9318098165136328
However, the increasing knowledge, instead of clarification, leads us to realize that these terms may assemble a wide variety of lung pathologies.	1.0933092452054887
Indeed, many circumstances can result in these syndromes and no particular factor has been defined to distinguish ARDS of one etiology from another.	1.0576905537197587
We are still ignorant about which factors lead to the extended inflammation from pneumonia to ARDS, while it is not clear whether the timing of events are determined by some mediators.	1.113733284594631
Furthermore, in the clinical arena, there is no clear distinction between pneumonia, severe pneumonia which may lead to ALI and then ARDS.	1.3437291652952226
Finally, the results of all these studies should have allowed us to investigate new therapeutical approaches while none seems to emerge.	1.0614661079644219
This review is an analysis by an ICU clinician of the different points of view of these syndromes and intends to give a global vision of the numerous factors implied, emphasizing the complex interactions between them.	1.1208401788959574
The present state about new potential treatments directed on mediators is summarized.	0.8217187924511278
The aim of the study was to evaluate if a combined physiologic-therapeutic scoring system (MARIS = Marburger Intensive Score) offers better outcome prediction compared to scoring systems, which are based either only physiologically (APACHE II = Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) or only therapeutically (TISS = Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System) in medical intensive care medicine.	1.1325615945324266
Main outcome parameters employed were hospital mortality, severity of disease classification and length of hospital stay.	0.9252007151451643
During a 12-months period (1993/94), 531 consecutive patients (ICU stay >4 hours) being admitted to a medical ICU of a tertiary care university hospital were prospectively investigated.	1.1178067771424234
The day-1-scores of MARIS, APACHE II, and TISS were determined and the patients were followed until hospital discharge or death.	1.1891579762073823
There was no advantage in using the combined scoring system (MARIS) neither in discrimination between survival and non-survival (hospital mortality; areas under the ROC-curve: MARIS = 0.84, APACHE II = 0.86, TISS = 0.78) nor in severity classification (relationship between day-1-scores and hospital mortality: p<0.001 (chi2-Test) in all three systems).	1.1004686573252096
In contrast only for the combined system (MARIS), a dependence of length of hospital stay from day-1-scores in the analysis of survivors only and in the analysis of all patients (survivors and non-survivors) (p<0.001; ANOVA) could be demonstrated.	1.0904781956961824
In conclusion the combined physiologic-therapeutic scoring system (MARIS) did not offer a better outcome prediction concerning hospital mortality and severity classification compared to the established systems in critically ill patients.	0.8972750541787823
Its use may be advantageous in evaluating the relationship between day-1-scores and length of hospital stay, which for economical reasons has become a parameter of growing interest in intensive care medicine.	0.9838648077087017
A 23 month old boy was admitted to hospital because of anemia, mainly truncal rash and unclear pain.	0.8930755741854
Previously he had shown fever, conjunctivitis and desquamations of hands and feet.	0.6800163308931487
Laboratory findings were moderate leucocytosis, thrombocytosis, anemia, and an elevation of ESR and gamma-globulins.	0.9542627754356837
No bacterial infection was found.	0.6097981667776842
The ECG showed signs of a myocardial ischemia.	0.9416783723753793
The sonography of the heart detected an aneurysm of the left coronary artery.	1.11606957205608
The boy died of a sudden cardiac arrest.	0.7464868331059589
The autopsy verified the diagnosis of Kawasaki-syndrome and revealed two coronary aneurysms blocked by thrombosis and a necrotic panarteriitis.	0.9732009986959528
The etiology of the painful hip in children is widespread.	0.944393216159576
In this paper, predominants cases without previous trauma are discussed in detail.	0.8355947075435302
Depending on age, history, clinical picture and laboratory results, an imaging diagnostic algorithm is presented, which should avoid unnecessary tests and lead to the necessary therapeutic measure.	1.2426324899880974
Several common as well as uncommon clinical entities are illustrated by representative examples.	0.8050896869335705
The present study exemplifies the method of quantitative reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction (cRT-PCR) by quantifying, in bovine tissues, the specific mRNAs for the two key proteins which regulate cellular cholesterol metabolism, the low density lipoprotein (LDL) -receptor and the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase.	1.2223634802597012
Our data reveal a broad range of expression for both mRNAs.	0.7949784204579683
The LDL-receptor mRNA expression was highest in the adrenal gland (6.7 x 104 molecules/ug cellular RNA) followed by the corpus luteum of the ovary, intermediate in the liver (8.6 x 102 molecules/ug cellular RNA) and not detectable in the large intestine.	0.9652756248977539
Expression of the HMG-CoA reductase almost paralleled LDL-receptor values.	0.7713685784382233
It was found to be highest in the ovary (6.1 x 106 molecules/ug cellular RNA) followed by the adrenal gland, intermediate in the liver (3.1 x 105 molecules/ug cellular RNA) and lowest in the large intestine (9.9 x 104 molecules/ug cellular RNA).	1.0129806675369353
These data are consistent with other reports concerning the quantitative analysis of the expression of both proteins as determined by other experimental approaches.	0.869217827680366
Thus cRT-PCR is a valuable tool for the quantitative analysis of the LDL-receptor and the HMG-CoA reductase.	0.8526397619595563
Spinal opioids are effective analgesics for surgical and non-surgical pain.	0.8268402492226574
Central and systemic side effects are less frequent than with epidural local anaesthetics or parenteral opioids.	0.9052879225354209
This review focuses on the analgesic efficacy of spinal opioids and their combination with local anaesthetics for postoperative analgesia, including patient-controlled epidural analgesia.	1.1144472668142122
Intrathecal administration of opioids has some advantages over their administration by the epidural route.	0.8769268563630208
Several factors may influence selection of the opioid; however, in most situations morphine is the drug of choice.	1.1346672445859636
Thoracic epidural administration of opioids seems to have no clinically important advantages over the lumbar route in terms of quality of analgesia, adverse effects, doses required or pulmonary function.	0.9687227890638292
However, evidence suggesting that effective postoperative analgesia can significantly improve postoperative morbidity in patients at risk is accumulating.	1.270382317153257
In such patients, combined use of epidural local anaesthetics and opioids may become the technique of choice for postoperative analgesia.	1.227571212369807
However, there is no evidence that this would have any clinically relevant benefit in low-risk patients.	1.16200762534481
This contribution summarizes a discussion of several experts on the field of clinical nutrition, which was held in Evangelische Akademie Loccum, Germany, May 20-21, 1998.	1.1506133089186408
Nutrition can be considered a medical treatment, which justifies assessment of benefits according to outcome parameters.	1.098285546739006
With regard to nutritional support of the cancer patient, evaluation of quality of life (QL) is more appropriate than morbidity and survival related parameters.	1.1119392721682966
Quality of life is a multidimensional construct which can be measured by standardized questionnaires.	0.9545664851891603
The QL Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), is an established and validated instrument which provides reliable information with regard to disease-related limitations of QL.	1.3344022304891483
The measurement of QL can be extended by appropriate modules for specific problems according to the underlying cancer disease and special therapies (e.g., percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy).	1.0184544064062642
In the individual case, the interpretation of the role of nutritional parameters for QL may be confounded by other parameters, such as disease or personal changes.	1.0130654506873518
However, the information supports decision making about the indication, the route of nutritional therapy, as well as individual follow-up.	1.0769197745317116
Using QL as an outcome parameter, carefully designed prospective trials might be feasible in order to investigate the outcome of nutritional therapy in patients with advanced cancer.	1.0555369442701161
The inclusion of a control group is questionable from the ethical viewpoint.	0.7619008711544861
The treatment of distal fractures of the lower arm can be conservative or operative.	1.1789632377570949
The immediate aims of any treatment are anatomical realignment and the avoidance of trophic impairments, with the ultimate objective of unrestricted function of the hand and wrist.	1.0973817194576572
A graduated treatment scheme based on the ASIF classification is necessary to do justice to the different forms of fracture that can occur.	1.068360823223283
The majority of injuries can still be successfully treated by conservative means; operative treatment becomes more important when there are signs of unusually high levels of instability or joint involvement.	1.0590353104473194
The authors' own patient population is presented in this paper: in these patients fixation with Kirschner wires has proved to be the most successful of the operative procedures used, followed by palmar plate fixation with or without cancellous bone plasty, and for C-type fractures according to the ASIF classification or when there is severe soft-tissue damage, application of a fixateur externe spanning the joint has proved best.	1.1667811534935595
Treatment strategy, risks, complications and results are presented.	0.8524958798581623
Many couples have to cope with periods of involuntary childlessness and they often ask for medical help.	0.7535422828661641
In the Heidelberg Project of involuntary childlessness in men, andrological patients were surveyed from the time before diagnosis till the end of 1 year's andrological treatment.	0.9779611599901592
Cardiac complications remain an important cause of perioperative morbidity and mortality with noncardiac surgery, despite improvement in surgical techniques and anaesthetic management.	1.0130541627907301
Therefore preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment plays a pivotal role in management of patients prior to noncardiac surgery.	0.8777104275736342
Thorough history-taking and careful examination are essential to consider further diagnostic steps in order to predict the patient's individual perioperative cardiac risk as accurately as possible.	1.0530752032008297
Besides elaboration of medical therapy, cardiac catherization and even balloon angioplasty or bypass surgery must be considered if indicated by preoperative cardiac testing.	1.0315582678223232
According to the literature, chronic ankle instability occurs after acute rupture of the lateral ankle ligaments in 10-20 % of the cases.	1.026669530698351
The etiology of the instability are ligamentous damage and functional neuromuscular disorder of the peroneal muscles.	1.0035837285168419
The standards of diagnostics are the history with the frequency of inversion trauma per period and the interval from the primary trauma, the clinical examination and radiological stress tests.	1.2154092678661004
Newer diagnostic methods, up to now not well established in clinical routine, include stabilometry, cybex-measurements of the pronator muscles, the evaluation of peroneal reaction time on a tilting platform and dynamic pedography.	1.0071604037979882
Conservative management of chronic ankle instability consists of wearing ankle braces and rehabilitation programs concerned with peroneal muscle strengthening and coordination training.	0.8156881849056185
The indication for surgical reconstruction of the ankle ligaments are a well-documented mechanical instability with the neuromuscular reflexes intact and a failed physiotherapeutic training program.	1.127135723586886
The surgical procedure should be selected according to a priority list: 1. anatomical repair, eventually augmented with periosteum from the fibula, 2.	1.1432962560858828

No other disease has exhibited such a significant influence on the behaviour of health care workers (HCW) as the AIDS pandemic.	1.0019342992482978
Numerous epidemiological data, however, have proven that the overall risk of transmission of the human deficiency virus (HIV) during surgical interventions is low; it is 0.3 % for all types of percutaneous exposures.	1.2936357329236527
Nevertheless, there still is a need for wider adoption of safer surgical techniques to reduce the chances of HIV transmission in the operation theatre, which additionally minimize the risk of transmission of other blood-borne pathogens.	1.2147272643873601
In the case of occupational exposure to HIV-contaminated blood or body secretions post-exposure prophylaxis should be recommended stratified by the type of exposure and source material.	0.9589878501510952
Abstract   Pachyonychia congenita (PC) comprises a heterogeneous group of autosomal dominantly inherited conditions showing characteristic nail thickening and associated signs such as palmoplantar keratoderma, follicular keratoses, and mucosal leukokeratoses.	0.88990600619262
Less frequently epidermal cysts, hairshaft abnormalities, natal teeth and laryngeal involvement may be seen.	0.7298725564589049
Phenotypically and genetically two major forms of PC are recognized, pachyonychia congenita Jadassohn- Lewandowsky/PC type I (Medelian inheritance in man - MIM - 167200) and pachyonychia congenita Jackson-Lawler/PC type II (MIM 167210).	0.9653391152932019
Both conditions show nail deformities, focal palmoplantar keratoderma, and follicular hyperkeratoses.	0.9708818147483718
Diagnostically relevant are leukokeratoses of the oral mucosa in patients with PC type I.	0.9450585779200157
In contrast individuals affected with PC type II show premature dentition and multiple pilosebaceous cysts predominantely affecting the upper trunk.	0.8089434325030131
The latter closely resemble eruptive vellus hair cysts and steatocystoma multiplex.	0.6254499598954173
By mutational analysis keratin K6a and K16 gene mutations have been detected in patients with PC type I, and keratin K6b and K17 gene mutations have been shown to be the underlying genetic defect in patients with PC type II.	0.9554119719130115
We investigated the incidence of postoperative chest tube bleeding, administration of blood products, and changes in coagulation tests in patients with diltiazem (DIL) administration for reduction of myocardial ischemic episodes during elective CABG.	1.0497153977033227
We retrospectively analyzed the surgical and ICU records of CABG patients who had recieved DIL (27 pats.)	0.9782628788330876
or nitroglycerin (NTG; 26 pats.)	0.6759162547626599
or a combination thereof (COM; 25 pats.).	0.7359885046122577
Data investigated included the amount of postoperative chest tube bleeding (CTB), frequency of administration of packed red blood cells (RBC) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and changes in hemoglobin (Hb), thrombocyte (Th) levels as well as changes in prothrombin- (PT) and partial thromboplastine time (PTT).	1.1442906692199977
There were no significant differences among the three groups with regard to biometrical or operative data.	0.9626805765696828
The amount of CTB as well as the use of RBC and FFP were not significantly different between the groups.	1.0662992673495952
Also, there were no significant differences with regard to Hb or Th and PT or PTT, both in the early phase after the operation in ICU as well as after 24 hours in the ICU.	1.1602311851488003
The perioperative administration of the calcium entery blocker DIL reduces the incidence of myocardial ischemia during CABG surgery.	0.9296874258377685
This administration during CABG surgery does not increase the risk of postoperative bleeding.	0.7596847027268753
As compared to NTG, DIL does not have negative effects on Hb and Th levels or the commonly used coagulation parameters in the first 24 hours in the ICU after CABG surgery.	1.0019122382596244
Depression and fibromyalgia (FM) share common symptoms, indicating a close relationship between both disorders.	0.8586144573606858

Genetic epidemiological studies show that genetic transmission is one important component.	0.8390402023563833
Molecular genetic studies are on the way; the serotonin transporter promoter gene seems to be associated with neurotic anxiety and FM.	0.9479412861337435
Biochemical studies related to the serotonin and norepinephrine neurotransmission are disturbed in both disorders.	0.8373219415257978

At our hospital, closed dislocations of the elbow without neurovascular or osseous lesion are treated conservatively after successful reduction in the absence of a tendency to redislocation.	1.1011639581297756
Indications for surgery are irreducible dislocations and those with a tendency to redislocation as well as open soft tissue injuries, neurovascular and osseous concomitant injuries.	1.0160500096817784
During a period of 10 years 113 patients were treated according to this strategy.	1.012306101343029
Of these patients, 46 had simple dislocations of the elbow and 67 suffered from dislocations with osseous lesions.	0.9451850140475555
In 95 patients follow-ups could be performed after a mean period of 55 months.	1.1105717179086498
In more than 75 % of cases good or excellent functional results were documented; unfavourable results were seen only in patients with osseous lesions.	1.1681828956720655
Nearly all of the patients had a stable elbow joint at the end of therapy.	1.204877573615108
The present study investigated the frequency and influencing factors of petechial bleeding (PET) in the conjunctivae and eyelids in different causes of death except strangulation.	1.0792205280845304
In a series of 473 autopsies the over all occurrence of PET was 13.3%.	0.7700624698617279
The highest frequencies were found in fire victims (31%), persons who had died after intensive care (24%), cardiac death (22%), drowning and intoxication (16% each).	1.2331587510912325
The frequency of PET decreased with increasing age and increased with the body mass.	1.033034877278231
At first sight cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) seemed to influence the occurrence of PET, because the rate was 11% without and 19% with CPR (x2: p < 0.05); an aspect which has been mentioned in the literature.	1.0270749439492541
However, further analysis showed that a higher rate of PET could only be observed in causes of death where PET are often fround irrespective of CPR, whereas in the other groups PET (with or without CPR) are uncommon.	1.3148079245337922
Furthermore, a case-by-case analysis showed that in several cases with PET after CPR the causes could clearly be attributed to conditions other than CPR.	1.2222504471480764
In a second series of autopsy cases with only cardiac deaths (181 cases), the influence of age and body mass on the rate of PET was statistically significant and there was a tendency for more frequent PET with increasing heart weight.	1.1449621688098812
On the other hand, no statistically significant influence of CPR on the rate of PET could be found in this relatively homogeneous group.	1.084015130977702
Media reports convey the impression that the incidence of fatal accidents in the European Alps has been increasing yearly at an alarming rate.	0.9001544697787973
Although objective data is lacking, the annual reports of the mountain rescue services in Germany, Austria, the southern Tirol, Switzerland and the Chamonix region in France were analysed with respect to the fatal and non-fatal accidents which occurred between 1987 and 1997.	1.096587635813542
Because of varying definitions of "mountain accident" used in these countries, available data about the number of fatalities are not comparable.	0.9708753660433185
A 75-year-old man had painless, slowly enlarging tumors in the right and left infrascapular regions.	1.1001453874763107
Clinically, the tumors were nontender and semimobile.	0.9386797772930713
MR imaging and the operative exploration revealed tumors infiltrating the lateral thoracic muscles and periost of the scapula and underlying ribs.	0.9139955991779906
At surgery, the tumors were thought to be malignant, most likely liposarcomas.	1.1688287910850348
The histological examination showed the characteristic appearance of elastofibromas with spindle-shaped fibroblasts, which were separated by thick eosinophilic collagenous and elastic fibers.	1.0637388768593492
Elastofibromas are benign mesenchymal soft-tissue lesions that mainly affect elderly women.	0.8041118897469312
In 10 % of the patients bilateral, often asynchronous tumors are seen.	1.0931338862059614
Ninety-nine percent of the lesions are located in the subscapular region.	0.9032620291319802
Occasional elastofibromas have been described in the extremities, head, and in the abdominal and thoracic cavities.	1.2731736305671273
The relative success of thrombolytic versus surgical therapy of thrombus in transit has not yet been evaluated in clinical studies.	1.0234170136287934
Only case reports of one or more patients exist.	0.9079266708076459
Optimal therapy, therefore, remains controversial, and conclusive recommendations in favor of one choice of therapy over the other cannot be given.	1.147870235395203
Nevertheless, in current practice thrombolysis as a noninvasive and quickly available form of therapy is preferred, if no contraindications exist.	1.263141311758722
Two cases are presented together with a literature review.	0.9864030859649985
The Comèl-Netherton syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive hereditary disease.	0.8190011078151179
A 23-year old female presented with the classical triad of ichthyosis linearis circumflexa, trichorrhexis invaginata with bamboo hairs of up to 12 cm length and atopic diathesis.	0.915686528409882
Nevertheless, more than 20 years passed before the final diagnosis was established.	1.2935432656430075
In addition, the patient was slightly mentally retarded and suffered from a genital papillomatosis, minimal hypergammaglobulinaemia and a marked bilateral eyelid ectropion, more severe than previously reported.	1.175431861602107
Oral therapy with Acitretin was quite successful.	0.7114477910636721
Background: Recent studies have shown the usefulness of pars plana vitrectomy with the use of growth factors in the treatment of macular holes.	1.1537193333784759
Autologous platelet concentrates contain many growth factors to stimulate glial wound healing.	0.7672728142746725
In vitro fertilisation IVF and intrazytoplasmic sperm injection ICSI are the most commonly used methods of assisted reproduction.	0.8536645454900024
Whereas classic indications for both treatment options are widely accepted, for example severe tubal damage which cannot be microsurgically repaired, cryptozoospermia, severe OAT syndrome and repeated failure of fertilisation in normal IVF, ICSI might be indicated in a wider range of indications as well.	0.9915142988958473
In this paper a number of additional ICSI indications are defined, for example minor forms of andrological subfertility, reinsemination of nonfertilised oocytes on the day after conventional IVF, reduced motility of cryopreserved sperms, reduced quality of oocytes or ICSI after one cycle of unexplained fertilisation failure in IVF.	1.0866609972423553
Load on the human body can be influenced by shoes and surfaces which is important both in sports and rehabilitation.	1.0021793312760119
The loading which can primarily be influenced are impact situations and friction as well as the stability of the foot.	0.9724357823211857
This stability is of main interest in the prevention of pain and injury.	0.9420896522921361
However, a certain amount of loading is necessary to improve strength and structure of biological materials.	1.2540991442875715
In the past, the development of shoe and surface materials has hardly been perceived under this aspect, but may be increasingly important in the future.	0.9958509195521336
With optimal clinical management of patients with Marfan syndrome, life expectancy may be improved substantially from 32 years to a nearly normal life span.	1.0163288004428452
Cornerstones of clinical management comprise genetic counseling, life-style management, and cardiovascular surveillance, which includes regular aortic imaging and endocarditis prophylaxis.	1.106609458483298
Prophylactic use of beta-blocking agents as well as timing of elective surgery and the choice of the optimal surgical technique are difficult issues that obviously need to be individualized.	1.0032131531875597
Juvenile or postoperative patients as well as pregnant patients with Marfan syndrome pose particular problems.	0.7674119266791133
This review intends both to facilitate differential decision making based on referenced evidence and to provide guidelines for therapeutic strategies.	0.9234143630206404

In Germany, good clinical multicenter studies that are not supported by pharmaceutical companies are rarely performed.	0.991755874246875
Good supranational industry-sponsored studies are usually aimed at the registration of new (expensive) drugs.	0.864098875148285
The preconditions for co-operation in conducting industry-independent studies which are of interest for the scientific community have been improved substantially in Germany by instituting the working group of co-operating arthritis centers, the so-called core documentation where 32000 patients with rheumatic conditions were documented in 1997 and the institution of a sophisticated information system ("RheumaNet").	1.0606408838151677
The executive board of the German Rheumatology Association has set up an "ad hoc commission" that agreed to institute a "Committee for the Coordination of Clinical Studies in Rheumatic Diseases".	0.9628644868822342
In this committee rheumatologists subspecialized from medicine, orthopedic, pediatrics working in universities, hospitals and private practice as well as specialists in statistics and epidemiology shall be represented.	0.9119763947269007
In principle this committee is independent of the co-operating arthritis centers and the RheumaNet.	0.7699270168983446
All members of the German Rheumatology Association are invited to cooperate with this committee by contributing to the clinically important questions and participating in clinical studies.	0.865498696941181
The committee has to define key questions in rheumatology and shall plan and organize multicenter studies to answer these questions.	0.8440947147436413
In addition, study protocols of pharmaceutical companies may be examined as to their importance, quality, and feasibility.	1.1079627088205055
Abnormal uterine bleeding is a gynecological problem frequently seen in women from adolescence to the postmenopausal period.	0.894257851030528
Nearly 70% of patients' visits to the gynecologist in the peri- and postmenopausal period are due to abnormal uterine bleeding.	1.150816769166212
According to the "speed"-hypothesis of cognitive development, the slowing of information processing in old age is at the core of negative age differences in psychometric intelligence.	0.9905078114936184
The present study investigates the "speed"-hypothesis for fluid intelligence at the individual level using Latent Growth Curve Methodology.	1.0721421276164436
Date on 4 measurement points come from the Bonn Longitudinal Study of aging (N=128, mean age 67.2, 53% women).	0.9414780851266608
Based on principal factor analysis, markers of mental speed were the WAIS Digit Symbol Test and simple psychomotor task.	0.8123762582067333
As indicators of fluid intelligence the WAIS Object Assembly and Block Design were used.	0.7291203625229651
After separately fitting Latent Growth Curve Models for the trajectory of mental speed and fluid intelligence, a combined model showed no statistically significant improvement of fit for freeing the covariance between the two slope-factors.	1.0047637741833604
Interpreting this result, contrary to the "speed"-hypothesis the intraindividual change of fluid intelligence does not relate to the according change of mental speed.	0.8821043730392516
For patients with dilative cardiomyopathy (DCM), the prognosis is highly unfavorable, even under conditions of optimal medication.	1.088532896432952
At present, there is no option for causal therapy.	0.8585002689730951
Since there is increasing evidence that modifications of the immune system accompanied by the production of autoantibodies, e.g., against 1 ad-renergic or muscarinergic receptors, are involved in the pathogenesis of DCM, the elucidation of the possible functional significance of these autoantibodies has attracted increasing interest.	1.049419728180367
In addition to the role of autoantibodies as markers for an autoimmune process, discussion of the possible pathogenetic mechanisms has centered on direct toxicity as well as on negative influencing of myocardial contractility and energy metabolism.	1.0774163595096817
The effects gained through removal of autoantibodies by immunoadsorption therapy for DCM patients sheds light on the functional importance of autoantibodies in this syndrome.	0.8744657305672732
The principle of this form of therapy is based on the binding of circulating antibodies to sepharose columns, to which polyclonal antibodies against human immunoglobulin are linked.	0.962154403471207
A pilot study conducted among DCM patients disclosed that immunadsorption took place in simultaneous conjunction with a reduction in the immunoglobulin level and with significant hemodynamic and clinical improvement.	0.9889783757759559
These results may be interpreted as indicating that autoantibodies play an active role in DCM and that their removal by immunadsorption possibly represents a highly promising future therapeutic concept.	0.9314540084613814
Active unspecific immunotherapy in an adjuvant or palliative setting has been shown to enhance survival in melanoma patients, and gene therapy now offers new perspectives for active specific immunotherapy.	1.0209811355896965
Gene therapy includes the transfer of genetic material performed by either viral or non-viral methods and in vivo or ex vivo.	0.95816528073511
For melanoma the following approaches are suggested: vaccination with tumour-specific, HLA-associated antigens using peptides or `naked DNA', vaccination with melanoma cells transfected with cytokine genes or B7, adoptive immunotherapy with specific T-lymphocytes or transfected tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, or transfection of tumour cells with a tumour suppressor gene whose dysfunction plays a crucial role in melanoma.	0.9146541882258111
Since 1995, a total of 115 patients with pseudarthrosis or delayed bone fracture healing have each undergone a single session of shock wave treatment.	0.9584039759249066
After the treatment the fractures were correctly set according to the rules of conservative bone fracture treatment.	1.0435348640904
The mean follow-up period for all patients was 31 months (range 3-50 months.	1.2479197297783418
In 87 cases (75.7%) bony consolidation was achieved with simultaneous reduction in the symptoms.	1.1952139227672807
Apart from low-grade local reactions (swelling, haematoma, petechiae) no complications were observed.	0.8987448938497209
The treatment is noninvasive and requires little investment in terms of personnel or technology.	0.8868558870621467
Extracorporeal shock wave therapy should therefore be considered before an elaborate operative procedure is initiated in the treatment of pseudarthrosis and of delayed fracture healing.	1.029549456443871
The sound transmission properties of three different commercially available middle ear implants and the prototype of a complete middle ear prosthesis (CoMEP) were evaluated with a special measurement system that permits standardized conditions.	1.124872148706448
This system uses a mechanical middle ear model (MMM) which approximates the impedances of the tympanic membrane and inner ear.	0.9101140211909231
The implants were fitted under defined conditions into the MMM.	0.7370680141774163
Displacement of the artificial stapes footplate of the MMM was measured with an optical probe.	0.9306684468842183
The measurements of different middle ear prostheses showed that the mass of the implant was the most important factor for optimum high frequency transmission.	1.1334867790907956
The lightest implant (4 mg, titanium) showed the best results.	1.2241667632079984
The CoMEP revealed the highest sensitivity because of a slight enlargement of the diameter of the artificial tympanic membrane.	0.9920300943805674
These findings show that the CoMEP is able to restore sound transmission to a normal range.	0.9051027464597934
In a second experiment one of the implants was fitted into the MMM with different forces.	1.1973405108655168
The increase of stiffness produced a slightly better high frequency transmission at the expense of low frequency sensitivity.	0.9283500876182377
Hence, the fitting of the implant may not be too stiff because of its loss of mobility within a significant frequency range.	1.1289545457448151
Angiomyolipomas are hamartomas that may be found sporadically or associated with tuberous sclerosis (M. Bourneville-Pringle).	0.8940364977004079
Clinically, this long-term asymptomatic tumor becomes evident as an acute retroperitoneal hemorrhage or by symptoms of a flank mass.	1.2175507564161536
Due to the high percentage of fat components in this tumor type, computed tomography is far superior to other radiological procedures.	1.0481149918149792
In view of two of our own case reports, the therapeutic strategies are discussed, paying regard to the actual literature in this field.	1.3724077557413958
The excact pathogenesis of Peyronie's Disease (PD) is still unknown.	0.8967723190504898
Histopathological investigations suggest, that the metabolism of the collogenious tissue plays an important role.	0.9664891525648853
Therefore, we started a prospective study in order to evaluate the metabolic situation of 11 patients with PD and 11 healthy controls.	1.3258513083981276
We mesured biochemical parameters of penile and venous blood, wich correspond to the collagen metabolism (procollagen III [P III P], PMN-elastase [PMN-E], fibronectin [FN], fibronectinreceptor [FN-R] und -1-proteinase-inhibitor [-1-PI]).	1.1417267745353068
There was no difference in PMN-E, P III P, FN and FN-R in all samples.	0.999499808725245
There was no difference in penile and venous blood as well.	0.807530043200551
But we found out a highly significant lower concentration of -1-PI in patients with PD (158,55 mg/dl) than in controls (214,82 mg/dl).	1.1914405293137271
Closed rupture of the anterior tibial tendon is rare.	0.8534944538969358
Fewer than 50 cases have been reported in the literature, perhaps because the symptoms are often neglected by the patient as well as by the doctor.	1.1576906441030166
Most often the rupture occurs as a consequence of a sudden plantar flexion of the ankle and pre-existing degenerative changes of the tendon tissue due to systemic disease or iatrogenic local corticoid injections.	1.127009881186905
Clinically, the tendon rupture presents as acute weakness of the ankle extensors without reddening, swelling or neurological signs.	1.0482054565280554
Differential diagnoses such as anterior tibial syndrome and peroneal nerve palsy can thus be excluded.	0.8357691335302462
During the clinical examination the distal stump and the discontinuity of the anterior tibial tendon are often palpable.	1.1301545820136083
The clinical diagnosis can be confirmed by an ultrasound examination.	0.8618891359394816
An operation may be undertaken up to 3 months after the injury.	0.9670066185760172
Preferred procedures are end-to-end anastomosis and transosseous refixation of the tendon, followed by a plaster cast for 6 weeks postoperatively.	1.0001333002168382
High-risk patients can be treated conservatively, but the functional results are less satisfactory.	1.5106523923086421
We describe a case of an acute closed rupture of the anterior tibial tendon.	1.1965302993438938
A yet unpublished method of osseous reinsertion of the tendon is presented.	0.8928575824569068
In this four-part review article, an update of Psychological Gerontology since 1988 in German speaking countries is given.	0.9684774120812899
Part II of this review focuses an personality development in old age.	1.060302057048781
In accordance with their current relevance within research on personality development, concepts and empirical studies concerned with coping, psychological resilience and development regulation in old age are addressed in the first part of this review (contributions to basic research).	1.0173659387847611
First, research based on the two-process-model of coping, the personality theory of Thomae and the life-span theory of control is summarized.	1.1267347614952035
Next, work on subjective well-being, self and self-regulation are highlighted.	0.9796617042902254
In the second part of the review (contribution to applied research), an overview of the scope of potential of psychotherapeutic intervention in old age is given.	1.1622852595387856
Background: According to literature, 30-60 % of pacemaker patients suffer from paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF).	1.273863051794572
As rapid tracking of PAF may cause severe symptoms in patients with dual chamber pacemakers, refined algorithms providing AV synchronous pacing during periods of sinus rhythm and preventing high ventricular rates during PAF are highly desirable.	0.9017902572394547
Aim and method: This comprehensive paper introduces a new mode switching (MS) algorithm which uses either a fixed (Inos2CLS) or programmable (Logos) number of short intervals out of 8 consecutive atrial intervals to detect PAF.	1.0030937540133085
If the MS criterion is fulfilled, a switch from AV synchronous pacing to nontracking mode is automatically performed.	0.8473931687834215
The algorithm is described together with a discussion on optimization of the programming of parameters which may indirectly influence the MS sensitivity and specificity.	0.976716682736018
Results: This MS concept maintains the high sensitivity and fast reactivity towards PAF of the "mode conversion" in Actros and Kairos pacemaker systems, preventing a long time delay between onset of PAF, detection of the arrhythmia, and switch to nontracking mode.	1.1591322459219828
In addition, adequeate sensing and short blanking periods in the new MS concept enable reliable MS.	0.9833293509972589
The occurrence of atrial oversensing should be tested, as it may lead to inappropriate MS. Programmability of the MS algorithm may be advantageous for individual programming with respect to the patients' arrhythmia rate and atrial sensing performance, but the use of very restrictive or very liberal criteria should be avoided as both may lead to mode oscillations.	1.1608647990190981
Finally, examples of stored diagnostic data are presented to assess MS reliability, identify possible problems, and optimize MS function during follow-up.	1.0749880620499397
Purpose: To evaluate MR imaging at 1.5 Tesla in patients suffering from acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) using proton-density weighted (PDW) fast spin echo (FSE) and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences.	1.0814484395107757
A number of infectious agents has been newly detected in the last 10 years.	0.9839787565658028
Climatic hanges and migration have been the most important factors in the emergence of new and old infections.	1.006087963807487
Additionally, new methods for the detection of DNA and RNA have played an important role in the detection of agents difficult to culture.	1.0512777837841496
So far medical requirements for aviators have been defined by national licensing authorities.	0.8001200866929852
For a long while ophthalmological problems, insufficiencies in vision, refraction or color vision, have been responsible for approximately 50 % of rejection of applicants for medical reasons.	1.050175907871526
Introduction: Coronary arterty disease still remains the primary cause of death in the western industrialized world.	1.2165472518344316
Although the clinical value of selective coronary angiography (SCA) is beyond dispute, the associated risk of an invasive approach, the inherent costs and the necessary hospitalization have lead to the development and investigation of novel non-invasive techniques for coronary imaging.	1.2327955202664347
Intravenous coronary angiography (ICA) has been shown to permit non-invasive imaging of the coronary arteries.	0.9855003686638135
We report nine case histories of patients admitted to a psychiatric hospital for severe somatic disorders.	0.9429091954558214
The somatic disease was either the cause of the psychiatric symptomatology, or it occurred in addition to a well-known psychiatric disorder.	1.1711044395342407
For general practitioners and psychiatrists it can be difficult to differentiate between symptoms due to psychiatric disorders and symptoms that indicate somatic disorders.	0.8811849535243024
If patients refuse the necessary diagnostic or therapeutic procedures and show behaviour that is not related to good health, there is increased risk for complications and increased morbidity.	1.1545238383928413
Penetrating neck injuries are potentially life-threatening injuries.	0.8612385474432653
Management is controversial despite decades of discussion in the literature.	0.6846975839521214
An algorithm for diagnosis and therapy is needed because of the potential risk of mortality.	1.0603087675739071
In the Department of Trauma Surgery of Vienna Medical School, mandatory surgical exploration after noninvasive investigations is practiced.	0.9258161942450804
Thirty-one patients with this kind of injury were treated between August 1992 and September 1999.	1.0363491154598024
Injuries were caused in seven cases by gunshots, in eight cases by broken glass, in one case by an iron rod, in one case by a spear, in one case by a branch and in 13 cases the penetrating injuries were stab wounds caused by knives.	1.2431130925316949
Complications like pseudoaneurysms and fistulas were not seen.	0.6620504452571709
No patient came to death.	0.47017916276465616
During a 18-year-period 93 patients (f=76, m=17) with a factitious disorder were identified in the psychiatric consultation service of a university hospital (incidence: 0.62%).	1.1559581901197178
50% of women were working in medical professions whereas only 6% of men.	1.3879934919350914
Chronic courses of illness were prevailing, but at least one quarter of female patients showed an intermittent type.	1.1993550855559714
There was a classical Munchhausen syndrome in 11% of patients.	1.0247745072049126
Depressive and anxiety disorders (10%, 4%) were to be respected as psychiatric comorbidity.	1.321711553689261
Ca 25% of the patients suffered from a somatic illness in addition to the factitious disorder, and one third of the women had symptoms of psychosomatic, especially of eating disorders.	1.2419071774132366
Previous somatoform disorders, deliberate self harm and attempts of suicide were to be noted in the psychiatric history of many patients.	0.970660600528232
There were frequent traumatizing events (foster home, disturbing family disharmony, physical and sexual abuse, early losses, serious illnesses) in the early biography.	1.1062004948742805
Various psychosocial stressors could be identified in the actual eliciting situation.	0.9818079314636644
The results are discussed in respect of epidemiology, development and clinical phenomenology of factitious disorders, psychodynamics and psychopathology of deception and self harm, and therapeutic options in the psychiatric consultation service.	1.047267244612364
In a long-term follow-up we evaluated 40 patients out of 55 (73 %) with a subtalar fusion.	1.1531927194353737
The operations took place from 5/84 to 5/91.	0.8116337245269194
In all cases the indication for the fusion was a post-traumatic arthritis after an intra-articular os calcis fracture.	1.1345221586094494
The evaluation of the overall results was carried out with three different scoring systems: a.	1.1464259066147784
The Outcome-questionnaire, rating patient's complaints and the functional status based on the severity-symptom scale and functional status described for Carpaltunnel-syndrome by Levine et al.	1.0621948223074478
c. The clinical rating system (CRS) described by Kitaoka et al.	1.1109119916503074
The statistical evaluation was performed by analysis of variance (ANOVA).	0.8962825032568621
Level of significance was based on P = 0.05 and calculation of Pearson's correlation coefficient.	1.007243796715351
The Os calcis fracture was the cause for the subtalar arthritis in all 40 patients (33 males and 7 females).	1.0299249337406182
The primary treatment of the calcaneal fracture was conservative (cons.)	0.9210917900403879
using a plaster in 23 patients (57.5 %), while 17 patients (42.5 %) underwent open reduction and plate fixation (op.).	1.1287649310623613
The interval between trauma and subtalar fusion averaged 3.5 years (3 months to 20 years).	1.1433392279872971
The interval between subtalar fusion and follow-up averaged 5.2 years (4-14 years).	1.0564305103319913
The mean age at the time of reexamination was 47 years (26-61 years).	0.9380767824580472
In the present study, complete pain relief could be achieved in 21 (52.5 %; 58 % op., 50 % cons.)	1.2204385120772583
A relevant restriction in the range of motion in the ankle joint was found in 26 (65 %; 76 % op., 58 % cons.).	1.2496630435005975
In 23 patients (62 %; 65 % op., 59 % cons.)	1.106901167095233
the radiological evaluation revealed a grade 1  ° arthritis of the ankle joint, in the talonavicular joint in 17 patients (42.5 %; 41 % op., 45 % cons.	1.1796081901170157
), and in the calcaneo-cuboid joint in 14 patients (35 %; 47 %., 27 % cons.).	1.3803852443013265
The statistical analysis revealed a better outcome in the operative group compared with the conservative group, although the operated os calcis fractures in the majority were the more severe fracture types.	1.3939104231934802
In all evaluation systems a score between 61 and 69 points could be achieved with no significant difference between the operatively and conservatively treated groups and between the newly developed questionaire and the clinical-radiological scoring systems.	1.032728954317123
For the questionaire this fulfills the requirements for a reliable outcome evaluation.	0.8094923896587483
Objectives Correction of an overriding fifth toe.	0.7709070220072595
Non-palpable breast-lesions like microcalcifications often fail an exact diagnosis.	0.7939449716999957
Accurate treatment is difficult by conventional marking and operating procedures since freehand positionin of al localization wire is often suboptimal.	0.8589101680625519
The consequences are larger tissue-defects leading to an insufficient cosmetic result.	0.8424152109734949
Nevertheless, resection of microcalcifications by conventional surgery remains sometimes incomplete.	1.099490620465587
Digital mammography coupled with stereotactic biopsy procedures gives more accurate results with minimal invasive techniques.	0.8186472428824749
The advantages and disadvantages of the advanced breast biopsy intstrumentation (ABBI) procedure versus vacuum biopsy systems are summarized and compared.	0.8582988471690983
Either of those systems is highly accepted by the patients due to the outpatient manner of its application and the convincing results regarding sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the methods.	1.0996747044665023
Chondroid syringoma belongs to the group of so-called mixed tumors, like pleomorphic adenomas of the lacrimal and salivary glands.	0.9665890077374297
The histogenesis of this tumour is still disputed, in particular with respect to its stromal component.	1.2298813149095185
The distribution of cytokeratins (CKs), CEA, EMA, vimentin, S-100 protein, desmin and actin [-smooth muscle actin (-SMA)] was investigated by immunohistological examination of paraffin sections from a chondroid syringoma of the apocrine type.	1.0880468362190359
The neoplastic formations have been classified into tubuloalveolar structures, solid nests/aggregations and stromal cells of varying morphology.	0.8299785383915178
The innermost cells of tubuloalveolar structures were characterized by marked expression of CKs (KL1 and MNF116), CEA and EMA, while in the outer ones there was moderate expression of vimentin, S-100 was expressed to a lesser extent and KL1, weakly but there was marked and consistent expression of MNF116.	1.0455400381259734
Whereas the solid nests expressed vimentin, S-100 protein, MNF116 markedly and KL1 weakly, the stromal cells were consistently positive for vimentin, S-100 protein and, focally, CKs and -SMA.	0.933265371347143
Anti--SMA specifically detects myoepithelial cells.	0.5347532692494127
In addition, the partly overlapping immunoreactivity of the intermediate filaments, membrane proteins and proteins in the different structures may indicate a common clonal origin of all neoplastic cells in chondroid syringoma.	0.9844947000029278
Leg ulcers may be caused by many different diseases.	0.6263980603181188
Most frequently, they are due to vasculopathies, to a lesser extent to metabolic, neuropathic or hematologic diseases.	1.0257223151669626
Neoplasms, connective tissue diseases, infections, trauma, and panniculitis should also be included in the differential diagnosis.	0.8057372735074705
A 38-year-old Caucasian female patient with hereditary prolidase deficiency developed progressive and very painful leg ulcers.	1.0086515569131016
The ulcers first appeared in childhood and did not respond to various treatments.	0.8338952617113726
Additional features of prolidase deficiency included mental retardation, short stature, extensive dental caries, and multiple malar teleangiectases.	0.9349298459426101
Hereditary prolidase deficiency is a very rare autosomal recessive disease.	0.8360754182816698
It is caused by heterogeneous mutations of the prolidase gene and affects many aspects of protein metabolism.	0.7586629114740874
Ion exchange chromatography and high voltage electrophoresis of urine can prove the suspected diagnosis.	0.7794918149674116
So far, there is no efficient therapy for hereditary prolidase deficiency.	0.8838729993544999
All reported treatment attempts have ended in failure.	0.5984848120558048
In this paper the basic features of acute, subacute and chronic types of osteomyelitis, skeletal tuberculosis and some special forms of osteomyelitis are described.	1.0716728359784384
The diagnosis of osteomyelitis is established using clinical signs and symptoms, culture studies, laboratory studies and radiological signs.	1.0544580967343733
The common conservative and surgical treatments are discussed.	0.7251924947422438
In the treatment of post-traumatic/postoperative osteitis severe problems are encountered as a result of an increasing number of orthopaedic traumatologic surgical techniques using a variety of implants and because of a generally increasing occurrence of multiresistant strains.	1.027474748276571
Thanks to modern treatment and the increased use of antibiotics, a considerable decrease in morbidity and mortality is observed.	1.203470303310771
Despite this improved prognosis, an established infection remains one of the most challenging problems for the orthopaedic surgeon.	1.0997148981243707
Besides an exponential growth in possibilities for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention in reproductive medicine and genetics, the synergistic effects of modern health technologies have led to the necessity of fast transfer of knowledge into the public domain in order to develop a common social consensus.	1.0595579955952934
Thus, physicians and scientists have enormous obligations not only for the development of medical technology but also of medical and societal ethics.	1.1272264607716138
Very early, i. e. in 1984, the German Medical Association developed professional laws for reproductive medicine.	1.0858354837825355
In addition, the German government saw the need in 1990 for an "Embryo Protection Law" (Embryonenschutzgesetz).	1.1097027187064283
Today, in the light of European integration, the medical profession's and state's obligations are challenged in different ways.	1.17289771467332
Whereas the German Medical Association continuously works on professional guidelines for reproductive medicine and genetics - currently the case with preimplantation genetic diagnosis - the government must develop the sociolegal framework for ethically sound reproductive medicine, i. e. , in the areas of inheritance law, adoption law, family law, and law of succession, the latter especially in the case of discrepancies between genetic vs. social paternity in heterologous insemination.	1.2000738718711903
In Crohn's disease, some concomitant neurological illnesses such as cerebral ischemia following arterial or venous thrombosis, subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord following malabsorption of vitamin B12 or folic acid, opticus neuropathy, and polyneuropathy have been described.	0.9667462393127444
Cerebral vasculitis secondary to Crohn's disease seems to be a very rare phenomenon.	1.152225220726774
We report on three such cases in three female patients (aged 26, 29, and 61 years).	1.2571044906731352
All patients became symptomatic with a hemiparesis; one complained additionally of a speech disorder, headache, and intermittent loss of orientation.	0.9747243015445988
In CT and MRI scans, multiple lesions were detected; cerebral angiography showed multiple stenoses of middle- and large-sized vessels that were compatible with cerebral vasculitis.	1.0486384849862898
Serologic tests concerning vasculitis were inconspicuous at that time.	0.6025800744179356
Under anticoagulation (in two cases) and immunosuppressive therapy, neurologic symptoms disappeared.	1.1623879038368718
In the following 6 to 12 months, no new neurological symptoms appeared.	1.145709688070037
In two cases, Doppler sonographic controls showed stationary and, in one case, progressive intracranial stenoses.	1.0337054316818273
The serin protease tryptase (ECNr.	0.6162325569080949
3.4.21.59), which is almost exclusively expressed in mast cells, is released by mast cell degranulation in an enzymatically active form together with other mediators, e.g.	1.086034872978205
histamine, into the extracellular space and the circulation.	0.8590154170252713
The capability of the enzyme to directly stimulate several cell types as well as to cleave polypeptide hormones and to activate pro-enzymes suggests a role for tryptase in inflammatory and tissue-remodeling processes.	0.9838370468034343
Therefore, in the skin, a role of tryptase is suggested not only in mastocytosis and immediate type hypersensitivity reactions, but also in other inflammatory diseases, degenerative or neoplastic conditions as well as in wound healing, where an accumulation and/or activation of mast cells is found.	1.2286288540692367
Extracellular tryptase may be superior to histamine as a parameter for the onset and course of immediate type reactions and as an indicator for the activation of mast cells in other conditions.	0.9963985712588441
Its absence during histamine-liberating reactions may suggest basophil activation.	0.6408013780142608
In addition, tryptase has been shown to be a sensitive and specific marker for the localization of mast cells in tissues.	1.1445422971846009
Background: Since the development of lacrimal endoscopes with which the mucosa and disorders of the lacrimal drainage system can be examined directly, the choice of surgical technique has changed decisively.	1.2139738612091948
Flexible miniendoscopes can be combined with a laser for the first time, allowing for exact localization of the stenosis and subsequent therapy.	1.0024251626121243
Surgery of tibial plateau fractures with joint involvement (AO classification 41 A1, B1-B3 and C1- C3) makes high demands on traumatological management.	0.9109748937384626
By using modern, minimally invasive operative techniques for juxta-articular fractures, it is possible to prevent soft tissue injuries that might affect the functional result.	1.1642748365810298
The aim of this technique is to achieve the exercise stability obtained with standard procedures.	1.3159147211230824
Arthroscopically assisted osteosynthesis not only minimizes the surgical soft tissue trauma, but also enables a precise assessment of the articular surfaces under the operation, as well as the simultaneous treatment of concomitant intra-articular injuries, a particular advantage as compared to conventional operative methods.	1.2091772286607971
From a total of 54 patients with tibial plateau fractures, arthroscopically assisted osteosynthesis was performed in 34 patients at our clinic from September 1994 to January 1998.	0.9639613500800528
The follow-up of a total of 17 patients revealed good recoveries when assayed by means of the Lysholm and Delamarter score.	1.084787499582702
We suggest that arthroscopically assisted, minimally invasive osteosynthesis can also be used in selected patients for the treatment of AO classification 41 C1-C3 fractures.	1.0715620711075686
Dorsal tension band fixation is a wide-spread technique of finger arthrodesis.	0.8770885879367895
When using a resorbable PDS-suture as tension band fixation a costly implant removal is not needed.	0.8551280779604508
Aim of this study is the investigation of the primary stability of this technique in combination with the cup-in-cone-procedure.	1.3321783731458008
Freeze-preserved fingers with thread tension band fixation using the PDS-material (series 1), the same fixating method on formaldehyde preserved fingers (series 3), freeze-preserved fingers with a standard tension band fixating (wire loop, series 2) are load in a four-point-bending in the direction of palmarflexion.	1.1464727413447102
From 6 degrees onwards the wire-tension-system requires a higher torque for bending, but in case of higher torque frequently leads to fracture.	1.0257410933160058
The examination shows that the thread-tension-band method by PDS-loop for the stabilisation of finger joint arthrodesis has a sufficient initial stability against bending forces.	0.9042556311615612
Modern medicine has succeeded in achieving enormous technical developments.	0.6397747690295981
One recent highlight has been the introduction of postmortem organ transplantation.	0.8055122591012808
At the same time, serious objections have been raised concerning the radical changes in the cultural conception of the inviolable body.	0.8460920059161121
One major objection arises from the conflict of considering a brain-dead person as dead.	0.787853786486518
The presence of brain death is a prerequisite for post-mortem organ donation, because only during this phase of dying does the individual quality as dead while the organs, other than the brain, remain viable.	1.0866675747040624
The objection implies scepticism as to the physician's ability to distinguish a dead from a living person.	0.9445005336208039
On the other hand, even the critics must rely on the physician's ability to discriminate, e.g., when to discontinue resuscitation.	1.0825847473932402
The medical community has not found reasons to restrict the definition of irreversible coma 25 years after its first formulation.	0.9813722261595104
It must be clearly recognised that reasons other than medical ones can be decisive for refusing organ donation.	0.8368647749380083
One ethical problem is the therapeutic benefit of organ transplantation.	0.8309860890928278
The beneficiary of the treatment is not the donor, but another person, the recipient.	1.4468004674999257
The concept of human dignity does not allow the use of a person fur purposes other than the ones he/she consents to, as Immanuel Kant stated.	1.0172891746023753
Although the human corpse is not a person in the full sense, even if it is protected by the thought of respect for the former person, the life-interest of the organ recipient had to be considered legitimate.	1.1973282972719805
The resulting conflict between the respect for the donor and the life-interest of the recipient should be balanced by seeking the donor's consent as far as possible.	0.8822064357456914
The proposed information model seems adequate at the moment.	0.7726108508112712
A common report of both churches in Germany in 1990 supported postmortem organ transplantation.	0.868703665489374
The report dealt with the medical problems and harmonized them with the Christian value of solidarity.	0.9127425430808069
The ethical alternatives to organ transplantation, however, are not mentioned.	1.0794559113058255
Within this limitation, the report seems to adequately express the aim to strengthen individual competence and plead for fair perception of the neighbour's life-interest.	0.9946848134637123
Starting point for this analysis are the mobility needs and requirements of elderly, as well as problems concerning access and use of public transport.	0.902804567573282
Elderly people as car drivers suffer from several performance deficits which are currently compensated by mobility restrictions and changed driving behaviour.	0.832137986657688
Driver assistance systems, just available or soon on the market, are demonstrated and analysed with respect to their impact on elderly drivers.	0.9857965511806841
An expert evaluation comes to the conclusion that the most important systems for elderly are: emergency systems, enhanced vision systems and parking aids.	1.0295954670174066
Emergency systems can call rescue teams automatically or at driver's request, and direct them to the emergency location.	0.9960361870841914
Self imposed restrictions of elderly concerning night driving can partly be compensated by means of curve lightning and automatic dipping.	0.7560143895957762
Parking aids, using cameras or infrared technique are especially helpful for persons with movability problems.	0.9125982029826757
The group of helpful, but not highly important driver assistance systems covers several means for longitudinal and lateral control of the car, comprising autonomous cruise control, antilock systems and electronic stability programmes.	1.0903960580615966
The value and impact of these systems are analysed in the light of risk homeostasis theory.	1.0837993423863304
Reduced work load and ease of mobility will at last result from user centered navigation systems, helping the elder driver also to move to new areas without orientational problems.	0.8129515667998098
The article demonstrates the particular importance of specific layouts of the man-machine-interface for elderly, to guarantee high acceptance and minimal distraction from traffic.	1.013212524640865
Causal treatment regimens of proven effectiveness in controlled studies are only available for cases of male infertility resulting from hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.	0.9847395465340981
Drug treatment of retrograde ejaculation is also effective but has so far not been tested in double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized studies.	0.914119345314034
The results of immunosuppressive therapy in cases of immunological male infertility are still controversial .	1.0191769838143305
In addition, antiphlogistic and antibiotic treatment of chronic male genital tract infections has not been shown to improve male fertility.	1.274918310374218
Inconsistent results have been obtained with empirical therapy - e.g., with kallikein, tamoxifen, clomiphene, pentoxifylline, mast cell blockers, testolacton, vitamin E, captopril, alpha receptor blockers, glutathione, indometacin, interferon alpha, growth hormone, zinc salts, ketoprofen, mesterone or testosterone undecanoate - or the studies performed are not sufficient to allow a final judgement.	1.0951830636988638
Recent studies have indicated a possible impairment of sperm function by pure FSH, while GnrH and FSH have no influence on spermatogenesis in normogonadotropic men.	1.027975710161194
In 40 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), in 5 patients with non-AD dementia and in 36 cognitively normal controls the concentration of protein tau was determined in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).	1.0289616858431831
Of the AD patients, 19 were very mildly demented (MMSE score from 25 to 28).	0.8620046020919219
Even in these patients, CSF tau was significantly more elevated than in controls.	0.799348634948853
In the non-AD patients protein tau was less increased.	0.7321132946582138
Among the AD patients there was no association between CSF tau and severity of cognitive impairment or deficit in cerebral blood flow, determined by SPECT.	0.9442807906697414
Our findings suggest that CSF tau may be elevated even at the predementia stage of AD and be useful as a biological marker for the early recognition of the disease.	0.9043346425722502
The aim of our review is to summarize relevant data on the perioperative use of anti-ischaemic drugs in patients at risk for or with proven coronary heart disease.	1.0536740004488772
The accessible medical literature according to current electronic information sources was explored.	0.7187000990833142
One in every eight general anaesthetics is administered to a patient at risk for or with proven coronary heart disease.	0.7525792342759948
Of these patients, it is estimated that 20% - 40% have perioperative myocardial ischaemia (PMI), the majority being nonsymptomatic.	1.3631502835193636
This figure correlates with the occurrence of postoperative cardiac complications and myocardial infarction.	0.7748007528161687
The anaesthetist therefore has an important role to play in reducing the rate of perioperative cardiac sequelae.	1.028291683246814
This can be achieved with good control of haemodynamic stability and the timely and appropriate use of antiischaemic drugs.	1.015625314060993
Nitrocompounds (nitrates, molsidomine) serve as the gold standard in current angina pectoris treatment.	0.9163773156187507
Acting as coronary and systemic vasodilators, they effect an immediate reduction in preload and have been shown to be the drugs of first choice for intraoperative myocardial ischaemia.	1.1503318974858583
Beta-blockers reduce the rate of PMI to a greater extent than nitrates.	0.9164492823791416
They are also effective in myocardial ischaemia not accompanied by an increased heart rate.	1.0175376815424473
Single pre-operative administration of beta-blockers has also been shown to be beneficial in reducing theincidence of perioperative tachycardia, hypertension, and PMI.	1.0278213993896879
Consequently, such one-time medication can be considered for previously untreated high-risk patients presenting for surgery.	1.357134516118495
The continuation of oral calcium channel blockers to the morning of surgery also reduces the rate of PMI and myocardial infarction in coronary-bypass patients, and combination with beta-blockers enhances this effect.	1.0407419314288475
Intra-operative diltiazem infusions are similarly advantageous in this patient group.	0.785962531115067
In addition to nitrates, calcium antagonists are the drug of choice for coronary vasospasm.	1.1282924929950389
Drugs inhibiting platelet aggregation have a particular role in patients with coronary heart disease, however, they also cause increased perioperative bleeding.	1.0611344961696436
Consequently, it is recommended that these medications be discontinued 5 - 10 days prior to major surgery, with the exception of high-risk patients.	1.287941866877009
Pilot studies using alpha2-agonists have shown reduced anaesthetic requirements and a reduction in PMI.	0.8121782677790161
The perioperative relevance of these drugs is currently being investigated.	0.9422036749528492
Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, and possibly alpha2-agonists lead to reduced rates of PMI and other cardiac complications in risk patients.	0.969184915373414
Current anti-anginal medications, with the exception of anti-platelet agents, should be maintained to the day of surgery and continued as soon as possible thereafter.	1.0929572655149502
All of these drugs except anti-platelet agents may also be used intra-operatively, however, possible interactions with anaesthetic agents should be carefully considered.	1.236474045953999
Inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) were thought to be psychosomatic disorders.	0.7596670471293648
However, this argument has recently been questioned by many researchers.	1.1911840941624594
At the same time, biomedical factors have been described that were claimed to play a role in the aetiology and modulation of the course of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).	0.9750519825240226
In the present paper, the state of research regarding both biomedical and psychosomatic factors of the aetiology and course of IBD is reviewed and critically evaluated from a methodological perspective.	1.1919064936467878
Results covering the following topics are presented: epidemiology; sociodemographic variables; genetic factors; dietary factors and cigarette smoking; drugs; permeability of bowel epithelia; immunological factors; microbiological factors; psychiatric disorders, affective symptoms, personality factors; life events and psychosocial stress; quality of life; and coping with the illness.	0.9354333563404761
Among biomedical factors, a genetically based pathological immune reaction is highly probable.	0.9622359359068112
However, the findings of immunological disturbances are of a more descriptive nature and seem to explain not the aetiological process of the development of the disease, but rather a kind of disposition.	1.2197426354189544
The question of which agents trigger the pathological immune cascade is still under investigation.	0.9964694427393963
Interesting findings can possibly be expected of the psycho-neuro-immunological research in this area.	0.7459612273238909
Results of research on psychological pathology (psychiatric disorders, personality factors) are inconclusive.	0.9466346174128191
In particular, some modern, well-controlled studies have not been able to confirm the findings of the older literature.	1.1363639406218855
Part of the high rate of psychiatric morbidity might be due to effects of selective sampling of more disturbed subjects.	0.9945031302199371
Research pertaining to the influence of distressing life events has also yielded inconsistent results.	0.8071686060083221
Prospective studies about the association of psychosocial stress and somatic symptomatology mostly demonstrated cross-sectional correlations which did not allow for causal interpretations.	0.8589757964897485
However, coping research has shown interesting results that point to the mediating influence of coping strategies on the course of the disease.	1.0132762116789662
Finally, perspectives for future research are suggested.	1.0795756284494278
Genital infection, particularly bacterial vaginosis (BV), increases the relative risk of prematurity.	1.224519729908063
Detection of disturbances of vaginal milieu at an early stage and the use of suitable countermeasures such as intervention with antimicrobial substances can reduce the preterm birth rate.	0.8651797933784768
A pregnancy with a partial or complete hydatidiform mole and a coexistent living fetus is a rare condition.	0.9760483189023453
Most cases are consistent with a twin pregnancy, with distinct borders between placenta and mole on sonography.	0.9777066091927772
We report a case with a single placenta with cystic structures resembling histologically a complete hydatidiform mole.	1.1751514370039016
The pregnancy resulted in a diploid female fetus in the 34th week of gestation with marked hypotrophy.	0.7891819188012383
The non-molar part of the placenta showed a complex alteration of villous maturity resulting in intrauterine growth retardation but a living fetus.	0.8666645786234521
No malignancy occured post partum.	0.5022268459089266
The clinical and pathogenetic aspects of this rare entity are discussed.	1.1813709571671895
So far, necrosis of the lunate bone has been interpreted in the literature as a phenomenon with a traumatic, primarily vascular-arterial or mechanical causation.	1.027319724862541
These models seem problematic, since neither the patients' histories nor the macroscopic-radiographical or histological appearances can be reconciled with them.	0.9929435642768305
In contrast, the model of a primarily venous aetiopathogenesis accepted for idiopathic necrosis of the femoral head is now examined.	1.0136402365456938
Evaluation of 125 cases of lunate bone necrosis treated in the Department of Orthopaedics at the University Hospital in Heidelberg between 1958 and 1993 made it possible to reconstruct the spontaneous course of the condition.	1.0683879554091786
X-Ray material, core spin tomographic images and material from a prospective study carried out in 49 patients with unexplained painful conditions of the wrist were available.	1.0956868764909777
A stage-by-stage progression emerged, which initially caused alterations only in the MR image, while the X-ray picture remained unremarkable.	1.2000009677854864
It was recognized from the spontaneous course that subsequent changes in the shape of the diseased lunate bones were always the result of the necrotic transformation process and never the cause of it.	1.0468619439478235
This meant that fractures were excluded as a possible cause of necrosis of the lunate bone.	0.8073656005943848
The spontaneous course was used as the basis of a stage-related classification for lunate bone necrosis.	1.1798394747179284
In a pressure measurement test, the behaviour of the intraosseous pressure in 16 necrotic lunate bones, 16 healthy lunate bones and 16 healthy capitate bones was tested under various functional conditions.	1.0441012822407383
The pressure fluctuations in the capitate bones were very slight, while in the healthy lunate bones pressure increased significantly during extension of the wrist.	0.9877642344431239
The position-dependent pressure increases in the lunate bones indicated that the venous drainage was constantly in jeopardy.	1.0206599612919285
The pressure increases in necrotic lunate bones were significantly in excess of those in healthy ones; in some cases they were far in excess of the systolic blood pressure.	0.9600101204199865
It was also concluded that necrotic lunate bones were mechanically deformed on movement.	0.8169650584217761
The anatomical causes of the pronounced pressure increases were examined experimentally.	0.8559221986488027
After staining of both the arteries and the veins, epoxy sheet plastination was used to fix six fresh cadaver arms in the neutral position and six in extension.	0.9269655025518149
Visualization of the vessels showed that capsular-ligamentous structures that were stretched on the palmar side and slackly turned back on themselves on the dorsal side still allowed the blood supply from the arteries, but substantially hindered venous drainage.	1.0395798965506546
The anatomical preparations made it possible to see that venous drainage from the lunate bone was being prevented; this explained the pronounced pressure increases.	0.9363732888422729
The unphysiological position of the base of the radius inclined in the palmar direction relative to the hand axis when it was extended dorsally was the crucial factor in the development of necrosis.	1.0138058073561687
Evaluation of the histories of the patients with necrosis of the lunate bone made it clear that trauma was not significantly involved in the causation, while manual work had an important role.	1.1948218550689227
Most manual activites are performed with the wrist in extension.	0.8582360874973368
Any extension favours triggering of bone necrosis through congestion in the venous trunk.	0.8417222762340314
Thus, our investigations have shown that the beginning of this illness starts with congestion such as occurs with every extension of the wrist, which is initially physiological, before further factors favouring the process cause it to take a pathologic course.	1.2930551656453042
The results of the German National Health Interview and Examination Survey 1998 confirm allergies as widespread diseases in Germany.	0.9239692711855391
In total 40 to 43 % of the adult population have or have had an allergic disease.	1.0555808546537493
The morbidity was assessed using a self-administered questionnaire and a personal interview performed by a physician.	0.9972370470140292
The agreement between questionnaire and interview data is greater than 90 % for allergic rhinitis, food allergy and urticaria and about 80 % for contact dermatitis and asthma.	1.2008098501765754
The results of both assessment methods showed remarkable differences between East and West Germany.	0.9403279423123421

For the emergency treatment of sustained, hemodynamically stable ventricular tachycardia, antiarrhythmic drugs are the therapy of choice.	0.9039485426948695
Mostly class I antiarrhythmic drugs, such as lidocaine or ajmaline, are preferred.	0.9935450664395823
In hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia, electrical cardioversion should be applied, in case of recurrences, followed by pharmaclogical treatment with class I antiarrhythmic drugs or amiodarone.	1.0048005149050963
For the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death, -blockers and/or amiodarone are the only effective drugs.	1.22210106206175
In the secondary prevention, only the implantable cardioverter/defibrillator has proved to improve the prognosis of the patients.	1.1961963555369837
Insular carcinoma of the thyroid is a low differentiated type constituting about 5 % of all thyroid cancers.	1.241281848521733
Higher aggressiveness has been suggested as an important clinical feature.	1.062996307465124

The result of an investigation of 128 from 283 (45,2%) medical and psychological psychotherapists established in the city of Hannover is presented.	1.2163288880240033
The aim of the study is to characterize the situation of psychotherapeutical care not only by the number of psychotherapists in relation to inhabitants but also by the working time spent for psychotherapy.	1.0198752425970445
Besides we found gender, school of psychotherapy and professional experience as factor influencing the patients waiting time for beginning a psychotherapy.	0.9599988741723525

There were no postoperative complications.	0.8648281965682211
Due to the coronary steal phenomenon and the related coronary risk, surgical repair is recommended also for asymptomatic cases.	1.0983025097866628
The surgical management of vesicovaginal fistulae (VVF) is a matter of controversy.	0.9466274407824067
This study deals with our experience with transvaginally treated patients suffering from VVF.	0.8256328158979968
Between 1966 and 1996, 64 patients with VVF were treated surgically.	0.88344917692104
The VVF occurred in the course of hysterectomy in 54 patients, was due to radiotherapy in 7, was a result of obstetric complications in 2 patients, and occurred after colporrhaphy in 1 patient.	1.1591088064427162
In 60 of these 64 patients closure of the fistula was carried out transvaginally.	0.9216838239562307
Fourteen of these 60 patients (23 %) had undergone prior surgical attempts to close the VVF (1 to 3 procedures).	1.0933307383985467
Transvaginal surgery was successful at first attempt in 55 of these 60 patients (92 %).	0.8667970649123075
The other 5 patients were successfully treated by a second procedure (again transvaginal: n = 3; transabdominal: n = 2).	0.9748991897626952
In conclusion, the transvaginal approach to close VVF is of advantage, avoiding an abdominal incision and reducing postoperative morbidity.	0.9581013369686837
In the vast majority of the cases isolated VVF can be treated successfully by transvaginal repair.	1.2332725301228742
Myotonic dystrophy is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder involving muscle, brain, heart, eyes, and endocrine organs.	0.9842159030599674
The underlying mutation is an expanding trinucleotide CTG repeat in the 3'prime untranslated region of a serine-threonine kinase gene on chromosome 19q.	0.7867106380447283
A statistical correlation exists between the CTG copy number and the severity of the disease.	0.7617815613341871
Infants with severe congenital myotonic dystrophy have been shown to have on average a greater amplification of the CTG repeat than is seen in the non-congenital myotonic dystrophy population.	0.9547295456389548
However, not all patients with many CTG copies develop congenital myotonic dystrophy.	1.1412745529700339
We present 13 patients with more than 1500 CTG trinucleotide repeats and show their variable clinical course.	0.8189418861371921
Whilst the incidence of psychiatric disorders decreases during pregnancy, the risk during the postpartum period increases significantly, often leading to the necessity of psychopharmacological intervention during the puerperium, and subsequently during lactation and breast-feeding.	1.1609615693751174
The necessity for lithium prophylaxis in manic-depressive women after childbirth has been identified, and it is recommended that weaning rather than omission of psychopharmacological treatment is preferable during the puerperium.	1.0167178623020838

In 300 patients with 339 coronary lesions the percent diameter stenosis (%-DS) was assessed both by visual estimation and by digital quantitative coronary angiography (DQCA) by use of an on-line computer workstation.	1.2476810607816675
The decision for coronary angioplasty in the same setting ("prima vista"-PTCA) was based on history, evidence of ischemia and visual estimation of %-DS.	1.3882306711352825
DQCA measurements of the 339 stenoses revealed a normal distribution of lesion severity with a mean of 58.4  +/-  11.3%.	1.1761045026405184
In contrast to DQCA visual estimation led to a bimodal distribution with a nadir at ~55% between two peaks at ~45% and ~75% and a mean of 70.5  +/-  19.6%.	1.2990670770078028
Visual estimation underestimated lesions in the range of 30-55% and overestimated the %-DS between 55-99%.	1.2766013713764635
Visual estimation revealed a %-DS >= 60% in 251 stenoses (74.0%) of the 339 lesions, an estimate that led to subsequent "prima vista"-PTCA.	1.1945376665916547
Conversely, DQCA revealed only 184 stenoses (54.3%) with a %-DS >= 60%; thus, 86 stenoses (25.3%) did not meet the morphologic indication criteria for PTCA.	1.1992066511994468
The bimodal distribution of stenosis severity according to visual analysis with an overestimation of borderline stenosis severity reflects a tendency for "self-referral" of patients for PTCA.	1.1092903736978705
DQCA serves as an objective tool in the decision-making process for PTCA and may reduce "cosmetic" interventions or justify to defer PTCA.	1.0131723306440428
Especially in the selection process for "prima vista"-PTCA DQCA-quantification of stenosis severity is recommended.	0.9248434049593256
S-100 protein and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) serum concentrations serve as markers of cerebral damage in cardiac surgery, neurology, or after head injury.	1.0153157702034303
In these circumstances, S-100 and NSE levels correspond with the results of neuropsychological tests.	0.9266210368057507
The present study investigated the diagnostic value in orthopaedic patients after joint replacement.	1.0641488387050861
Since its introduction in clinical use more than ten years ago, propofol is well appreciated for sedation and supplemental hypnosis in anaesthesia.	0.9388973070139512
However the substance is approved only for anaesthesia in children elder than three years.	0.8191334009807107
As can be substantiated by many data reported in literature, there are no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic reasons whatsoever to withhold propofol from the younger children; this applies both to the use as a narcotic supplement and as a short term hypnotic for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.	1.0470102487057513
Orthostatic circulatory disorders are frequently the cause of orthostatic intolerance, syncope or dangerous falls.	0.8991772004712446
A sufficient therapy should be based on a differential diagnosis by means of an active standing test or a tilt-table test.	1.023970962866527
Three typical pathological reactions of blood pressure and heart rate can be differentiated.	0.8348386122313526
The hypoadrenergic orthostatic hypotension is characterised by an immediate drop in blood pressure (systolic drop >20 mmHg below base line within 3 min) with or without compensatory tachycardia.	1.0243925393294393
It is caused by peripheral or central sympathetic dysfunction.	0.6027286158866912
Tachycardia (>30 beats per minute above base line within 10 min) without significant blood pressure drop but with a fall of cerebral blood flow indicates a postural tachycardia syndrome.	1.151278162414599
In general, there is no further somatic dysfunction.	0.9152639632608608
Increased venous pooling is thought to be the assumed pathomechanism.	0.9821272512067453
A reflex mechanism evokes the neurocardiogenic syncope after a certain time of standing: sympathetic inhibition yields a strong blood pressure drop and vagal activation bradycardia.	0.8503812025064855
Proved therapies include use of the mineralocorticoide fludrocortison (hypoadrenergic orthostatic hypotension), of the a-agonist midodrin (postural tachycardia syndrome) and of b-blockers (neurocardiogenic syncope).	1.2086133508790036
There are numerous diseases which can irreversibly stiffen the whole spine or parts of the axial skeleton.	0.8640737792689768
Due to didactic reasons one can distinguish 3 gropus of such disorders: -  Paradigmatic diseases of the spine with an inherent proneness to stiffness.	1.0681432345559039
-  Rare diseases which involve a certain danger of stiffening the spine.	1.073129075032054
-  Rigidity of the spine due to scientifically unrecognised morphologic phenomena.	1.1854079678910199
Modern approaches in knee endoprosthetics using computer-assisted navigation systems are based on matching procedures which refer to osseous anatomical landmarks.	0.8426953921582
However, surface replacement techniques require a correct position of the implants in relation to the bone, as well as an optimal postoperative interaction of the ligaments and the surface design of the endoprosthesis.	1.1892246724056468
Functional aspects are of elementary importance.	0.6724654642638972
A 79-year-old man died of fatal haemorrhage into the soft tissue of the true pelvis 2 days after transrectal ultrasound-guided prostatic biopsy.	1.0692842482439697
Autopsy revealed a perforation of the left prostatic lobe with ruptures of the periprostatic vessels.	0.8997599060647424
A similar case of transrectal prostatic biopsy-associated complication has not been described previously.	0.9897974385022895
The judicial enquiries were discontinued.	0.41352584155923217
Several different theories exist about the orign of kinetosis and the space adaption syndrome, with individual sensitivities differing significantly.	0.8940649435890266
One explanation involves the hypothesis of a different otolith mass between the right and left statolith organ and especially a difference in the utricles.	0.9901305481047556
A difference in mass results in a different sensitivity to acceleration.	0.9706381517742524
For this reason we measured interindividual variances in saccular and utricular otolith mass.	0.7655292757897431
Since the anatomy of the vestibular organ in vertebrates is based as similar principles, we selected fish (salmon and trout) as our study model to facilitation preparations.	1.0108644209654134
The maximum difference in mass in the saccule was 17% and was generally smaller in the utricle, although in individual cases was much higher.	1.2071514839933188
We assume that a misbalanced sensitivity of the statolith organs occurs but is totally compensated for by the vestibular system as long as physiological motion patterns take place.	0.9126849026433729
Decompensation leads to kinetosis under non-physiological motion patterns.	0.6316598109565535
When the vestibular system is better balanced and has an equally distributed otolith mass to both sides, the possibility for developing kinetosis or space adaption syndrome is much less likely.	1.0264497856232515
The clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of haematogenous multifocal osteomyelitis, a rare illness, are described.	1.090417256426244
Of clinical note are the pain, pseudoparalyses and restriction of movement.	0.633638404503576
Staphylococcus aureus was the pathogen in both of the cases we described.	1.0584399999387277
Sonography is a useful diagnostic tool for the localization of subperiosteal abscesses; scintigraphy is a supplementary examination for cases where it is difficult to establish a diagnosis.	0.9558727540289811
MR-tomography is the most reliable method for examination of proximal infected foci (spondylitis, pelvis osteomyelitis).	0.9207977603671256
In our view, the earliest possible removal of all infected foci by means of operation and parenteral antibiotics mare the most important treatment.	1.100055408308577
Interactions between the endocrine and immune systems are well known with special regard to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.	0.9474649465711615
Little of the literature focuses on the complex effects of cytokines on tissue responsiveness to glucocorticoids (GC).	0.9853974294538971
In bone tissue, osteoblasts represent a valuable model for studying GC-cytokine interactions.	0.8734727886294638
Hence, we have studied two human osteosarcoma cell lines (Saos-2 and MG-63) with different degrees of differentiation and different constitutive IL-6 production (3.4 +/- 0.3 (mean  +/- SE) and 3309 +/- 578 pg/106 cells).	1.2643022369009798
We measured glucocorticoid receptor (GR) number and affinity as a function of the exposure of cells to different amounts of IL-6.	0.9169957489408749
Incubation for 20 h with IL-6 at increasing concentrations up to 2000 pg/ml yielded a significant increase of GR binding sites in both cell lines.	0.9341431863091113
IL-6 was also able to reverse the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone (1 µmol/l) on GR in both cell lines.	1.0711925152949946
In MG-63 cells, expressing higher concentrations of GR, IL-6 deprivation via a specific anti-IL-6 antibody (100 ng/ml) significantly decreased GR.	1.0088104266623876
In Saos-2 cells, expressing lower concentrations of GR, a 40 h treatment with human IL-1 (10 ng/ml) significantly increased both IL-6 production and GR.	1.10807098400506
This latter effect was completely abolished by co-treating the cells with the anti-IL-6 antibody.	0.8700017999338231
Our results provide evidence that IL-6 is an autocrine positive modulator of GR number in human osteoblasts.	0.8840841572507114
Tumor debulking of gastrointestinal tumors for the reduction of tumor mass is intended to improve subsequent treatment efficacy.	0.8710329401376103
However, in advanced malignant disease, this therapy is often associated with increased morbidity and lethality.	1.353354750185194
Adjuvant therapies cannot be initiated when needed.	0.6062468368019035
Therefore, long-term survival remains unaffected.	1.3884112846572654
Advances in biomedical science provide preliminary explanations for these therapeutic problems.	0.7503052274319236
Modern therapeutic concepts like neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced tumors are based on these findings.	0.951265201853243
The probability of complete R0 resections, necessary to improve long-term survival, can be enhanced by these therapies.	1.131205275943071
The ongoing prospective neoadjuvant studies for gastrointestinal tumors are already very encouraging.	0.7740660350422766
The simulation of unilateral deafness is very rare.	0.7650806425312814
Objective findings are of special interest if it happens.	0.9699342558063021
A patient with alleged deafness on the left-hand side due to commotio cerebri was treated in our hospital.	0.850516940058527
Pure tone audiometry showed deafness on the left-hand side and normal hearing on the right-hand side.	0.9326680649531163
However, stapedius reflexes were found ipsilaterally left as well as contralaterally right, at 0.5 to 2 kHz with a stimulation of approxamately 90 dB SPL.	1.2085918584494253
Transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) were measured.	0.9854571453624734
The TEOAE had the same reproducibility but a very low response on both sides, such that inner ear function could not be evaluated.	1.1031285760052207
In comparison, the DP gram showed clear DP amplitudes over the whole frequency range on both sides.	0.9437395429499136
Nonphysiological DPs could be excluded by assessing the DP growth rate at three different frequencies.	0.9215473564104294
By means of brainstem electric response audiometry (BERA), with which the IV/V complex was detectable up to stimulation with 20 dB SPL clicks, and the Stenger test, a neural or central hearing loss could be excluded.	1.120945865898857
Normal hearing on the left-hand side was thus confirmed.	0.7140542745704962
In cases of simulated deafness it is possible to prove a normal inner ear function by DPOAE.	0.9989059806644757
DPOAE therefore complements the list of potential audiological simulation tests.	0.6498301451795437
Controlled studies of adrenal steroids in premenopausal women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have revealed subtle and inconsistent decreases in glucocorticosteroid (GCS) function, but prominent deficiencies of adrenal androgens (AA).	0.9746962308117785
Such findings have suggested that hypoandrogenicity may predispose to RA in younger women.	0.8253856943087176
However, recent prospective studies of serum cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels before (x = 12 yrs) the onset of the disease (pre-RA) offer an alternative perspective.	1.2795913236326173
Significant dissociation of serum cortisol and DHEAS levels was found only in the subgroup of premenopausal women who developed RA before age 50.	0.8397601450246777
This subgroup alone had significant deficiency in serum DHEAS levels.	0.7075837926502758
A growing number of casualties and the increasing restrictions of funding will lead as a consequence to changes within the field of trauma surgery.	1.0232341732312307
Despite these developments trauma surgery must maintain its major responsibility towards the victims of accidents.	0.8165175169252663
Therefore the German Society for Trauma Surgery (DGU) has to face the future economic and social challenges to influence the coming changes.	1.1371529261963649
This role compromises the engagement in a continuous struggle for the high and global standard of injury care in Germany, for quality assessment, education and training, research and adequate public relations.	1.1678589245470639
This paper outlines the aspects and visions of future trauma surgery and the means which may continue to guaranty international acknowledged standard of trauma care in Germany.	0.8917823343452975
Radiofrequency catheter ablation is the treatment of choice in atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia.	1.062230162842106
Electrophysiologic investigations in 623 patients revealed eight mechanisms of tachycardia ablation: Ablation of fast (I) or slow(II), modification of fast (III) or slow AV nodal pathways (IV), modification of both pathways (V), ablation of fast and modification of slow (VI), ablation of slow and modification of fast pathways (VII) and ablation of both pathways (VIII).	1.1131375649922912
The criteria of diagnosis of these eight mechanisms of tachycardia ablation are described.	0.9279361173256013
Follow-up showed fewer relapses in patients with ablation (0-2%) in comparison to patients with modification of a single AV nodal pathway (8-12%).	1.2519871838551706
Alteration of both pathways includes an increasing risk of total AV nodal block, which occured in 7 patients (1.1%).	1.1057000921099154
Detailed analysis of the mechanism of catheter ablation is recommended in all patients after radiofrequency current delivery for AV nodal reentrant tachycardia to estimate the risk of relapsing during follow-up or development of total AV block in the particular patient in case of a further ablation procedure.	1.219459073833996
An increasing life expectancy leads to a higher number of persons aged 70-84 years and persons aged 85 years and older.	0.8422221531063543
Information concerning changes in the spectrum of psychiatric morbidity is rare.	0.8802597579469036
The Berlin Aging Study was based on a representative age- and gender-stratified sample (n = 516) of Berlin citizens aged 70-100 years and older.	1.1797924879537895
In this interdisciplinary study, an intensive investigation was carried out by psychologists, sociologists, internists and psychiatrists.	1.0879043355589801
This report focuses on subjectively reported complaints (Beschwerdeliste, BL), observed psychopathological symptomatology (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, BPRS) and psychiatric diagnoses following the criteria of DSM-III-R (based on the Geriatric Mental State Examination, GMS-A).	1.0003797042458078
On the self-rating scale (BL) 10 % of all persons reported severe subjective complaints, 32 % moderate complaints.	1.0185530083116776
On the BPRS, 17 % showed severe psychopathological symptomatology, 75 % at least mild symptoms.	1.4070698609929069
Following the criteria of DSM-III-R, 23.5 % of all persons had a psychiatric disease, 4.2 % a disease of severe intensity.	1.2601423496152304
When the DSM-III-R diagnoses "Not Otherwise Specified" (NOS) were included 40.4 % of all subjects were diagnosed by the clinical judgement of the psychiatrists to have a psychiatric disease.	1.2194164450806466
The most frequent psychiatric diseases were insomnia (18.8 %), depression NOS (17.8 %) and dementia (13.8 %).	1.1760821015411589
Dementia showed the well-known age-related increase, whereas no other incidences of psychiatric morbidity were age-related.	1.080045971923522
Persons aged 70-84 years did not differ in the investigated psychiatric variables from persons aged 85 years and older, the only exception being the prevalence of dementia.	1.0247353704184543
A first overview concerning developmentary risk factors and protective factors for later psychic and psychosomatic disease is presented.	0.891490074623
Problems within the context of the collection of data and evaluation are discussed.	0.9971224728118705
We analyzed how psoriasis patients sought professional help and correlated it to their illness attitudes and feelings of stigmatization.	0.796231813526422
Semi-structured interviews of 400 patients were reanalyzed to identify homogeneous groups concerning initial reactions at first manifestations of the disease.	0.824493039894222
Four groups ("isolated", "stigmatized", "socially supported" and "non-stigmatized" patients) were found and cross-tabulated with five resulting groups of a second cluster-analysis concerning the "style" of the seeking behaviour of professional and paraprofessional help and medical measures against the psoriasis ("multi-users", "arranged mini-users", "waiting-room patients", "optimists" and "self- therapists").	1.3244905588300846
We were able to describe typical courses of illness behaviour depending on the initial reaction.	0.9258490218130346
The results are discussed with regard to the desirable identification of problematic patients within professional care units.	0.8748630401774271
The sonographic diagnosis of malignant lymphoma in childhood is described.	1.0503622686405487
Malignant lymphomas are sonographically relatively uniform: initial enlargement of the lymph nodes and organs involved and disturbance of normal echo texture by mainly hypoechoic lesions can be found.	0.9064246780659906
Generally, four sonographic patterns of infiltration are described: diffuse, small nodular, large nodular and bulky type.	1.1033490364727263
Secondary, tumor-related or inflammatory complications (e. g. dislocation or compression of vessels, thoracic inlet syndrome, venous thrombosis, ileus, urinary retention, abscess and effusion) can be sonographically evaluated.	1.130855505416571
Response to therapy correlates with normalization of size and echo texture and recovery from tumor-related complications.	0.9593880231453497
Differential diagnosis with ultrasound is based on the topographic distribution and echo pattern of infiltration and, with certain restrictions, on the echogenicity of lesions and perfusion feasible with Doppler sonography.	1.099844690659358
The primary diagnosis has to be established histologically.	0.9654945105190291
The treatment of acute posterior instabilities can involve a reconstructive procedure as well as an antidislocation augmentation.	1.1246209522798474
Tibial bony avulsion ruptures must be reconstructed.	0.5736247397272276
For the treatment of chronic posterior instabilities we used the patella tendon graft, which can be implanted by an anterior or posterior approach.	1.1228727128807563
In cases of posterolateral instabilities, additional procedures are necessary.	0.8826832549449958
Ultrasound of the Achilles tendon is a suitable means of differentiating various diseases of the tendon and the surrounding tissue.	1.006623524778504
Different forms of degenerative disease (tendinitis, peritendinitis or bursitis, fibroosteitis, and Haglund's disease) can be discriminated from rheumatic and metabolic diseases.	0.9355047788554063
Congenital and developmental abnormalities can also be detected.	0.7305183920893722
Tendon degeneration mainly occurs in the ventral part of the medial third of the tendon ("critical zone").	1.2629030763171363
Immature tissue in this area leads to temorary instability of the tendon with a high risk of rupture ("vulnerable phase").	1.2131583926050074
With sonography, lesions of the Achilles tendon are visible early in the course of the disease.	0.7734970923285487
The German social security legislation has recognized only recently the concern of quality assessment in the field of social and medical services.	0.9607268689612944
The legal frame for quality assessment in the field of medical treatment was enacted in the sickness insurance provision (Social Code - Book V) only in 1989.	1.0598015180247764
Quality assessment is considered to be a part of the production of medical services and, therefore, is regulated in the context of providing medical services.	1.0894081745882958
The legal provisions do not establish standards for quality and quality assessment.	0.8132274855404227
Due to the variety of medical services, quality assessment is not regulated in an exhaustive or systematic manner.	1.049312120362579
According to the law, providers of medical services (doctors, hospitals) are bound to participate in quality assessment.	1.0524656412827853
As internal quality assessment prevails in the definition of the various measures of quality assessment and the control of quality in all fields of medical treatment, external quality assessment is also prescribed for hospitals.	1.2399419314707014
Because the establishment of quality assessment is considered to be a part of the service production organization, consumers (patients) or their representatives are not involved in the definition, establishment, and control of quality assessment.	1.1227191910458916
The participation of patients should be provided by law.	0.7303409056552319
Introduction: Because of an increasing number of endoscopic hernia procedures, it is important to look into the possibility of standardizing these techniques helping surgeons to acquire the operative skills necessary.	1.1595408906406612
Material and Methods: To discuss these aspects, the documented data on TAPP operations that have been carried out in this department since 1993 were analyzed.	1.1111367691898943
The results of teaching procedures were compared with those of experts after they had gotten past the learning and development curve.	1.0072672012865886
Results: A total of 778 teaching procedures were performed by 10 surgeons with an individual experience of 30.5 operations (median).	1.1816686443268964
Before starting the first procedure, 89 were done by assistants operating the camera.	0.9066346266387703
The morbidity of teaching operations was 1.9 % compared to 1.4 % for those performed by experts.	1.2113609233147553
After a median follow-up of 23 months there were two recurrences (0.23 %) in the expert group and none in the teaching group (follow-up 16 months).	1.2453933791023972
Conclusion: Because of the potentials of standardization of the TAPP technique, the results of teaching were equal to expert operations.	1.1878947021880288
Therefore, TAPP is suitable for application in a routine setting.	1.1657743997663688
In spite of the high and lasting efficiency of transurethral prostatectomy, intraoperative blood loss results in increased morbidity in this procedure.	1.130860679595026
This led to the development of many alternative treatment modalities in the last years.	1.0124854129246685
To minimize the risk of bleeding, we improved the high-frequency technology in several steps.	1.1119544127782108
To achieve this, the output signals of commercially available high-frequency generators were modulated to the effect that each cut results in an efficient coagulation zone in the tissue at excellent cutting quality.	1.150008797219488
Laboratory and in vitro studies using porcine kidneys as well as clinical trials showed good cutting characteristics accompanied by a significant reduction of bleeding.	1.149428532448327
As a result, blood transfusions were less necessary, the transurethral catheter could be removed earlier in the postoperative period, and hospitalization time was significantly reduced.	1.1301149118257128
In conclusion, the improved high-frequency technology in form of the "coagulating intermittent cutting" results in a blood-sparing tissue resection with a consecutive reduction of morbidity.	1.0838165044183756
An accurate assessment of the duration of the ability to act following fatal poisoning can be of major importance in reconstructing circumstances leading to death, especially in determining whether the poisoning was accidental, self-inflicted, or the result of a criminal act.	1.205842995399434
Clinical publications have scarcely dealt with this problem.	0.6118834899701295
We therefore examined 20 legal autopsies performed at the Institutes of Forensic Medicine of the Universities of Würzburg and Leipzig as well as the respective records of the police and prosecuting attorney's offices in an effort to clarify this question.	0.9648767919440226
As a rule the victims retained the ability to act for 10-15 min.	0.8973571315972184
However, the material we examined and the literature also contain cases in which the ability to act lasted considerably longer.	1.2021188797953315
The present study is intended to provide expert witnesses with guidelines for clarification of cases of fatal intoxication.	1.0974236991587367
Androgenablation is the therapy of choice for the treatment of advanced and metastatic prostate cancer.	0.9139498743108334
However, in more than half of the patients the disease will ultimately progress within 2 years.	1.2594110391303373
Intermittent androgenablation through medical castration maintains the apoptotic potential.	0.6038986730915912
By periodically changing phases on and off treatment the quality of life of the patients is improved.	1.2045760689914167
Apart from reduced toxicity treatment costs are lowered and tumor progression is possibly delayed.	0.8284925353286329
In how far survival is influenced is presently not clear and remains to be evaluated in further clinical trials.	0.9125631656073152
During pressure support ventilation (PSV), the timing of the breathing cycle is mainly controlled by the patient.	1.0849839255226115
Therefore, the delivered flow pattern during PSV might be better synchronised with the patient's demands than during volume-assisted ventilation.	1.1140727351724193
In several modern ventilators, inspiration is terminated when the inspiratory flow decreases to 25% of the initial peak value.	1.027925739758693
However, this timing algorithm might cause premature inspiration termination if the initial peak flow is high.	1.1544464430873358
This could result not only in an increased risk of dyssynchronization between the patient and the ventilator, but also in reduced ventilatory support.	1.241126437802424
On the other hand, a decreased peak flow might inappropriately increase the patient's inspiratory effort.	1.014137735727984
The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of the variation of the initial peak-flow rate during PSV on respiratory pattern and mechanical work of breathing.	1.016679212673109
To date, positron emission tomography (PET) is the most powerful tool for the non-invasive study of biochemical processes.	0.984877250187025
Besides its usefulness for basic research PET has been proven to be superior to conventional diagnostic methods in several clinical indications.	0.9716634432410713
However, the introduction of PET into clinical practice has been hindered considerably by its costs.	1.0659939182832028
Several American studies lend support to the hypothesis that PET may be more cost-effective than the conventional diagnostic work-up - at least for some of its clinical indications.	1.1844612127094984
In Germany, however, this hypothesis has still not been verified.	1.0942330092611827
The rapid growth, development and organ differentiation during early human development depend on an adequate and balanced substrate availability.	0.888684615538951
It is well known that early nutrition has short term effects (e.g.	0.7237891746864852
on growth), and that marked metabolic imbalances in infancy (e.g.	0.8839784562110571
hypoglycaemia, phenylketonuria) have long term effects on child development.	1.0602779265526108
More recent studies indicate that also variations of metabolic conditions within the normal range, which occur during sensitive periods of early human development, may have marked long term effects on later prognosis and disease risks in adulthood.	1.0607849894763735
This metabolic programming was demonstrated in epidemiologic studies indicating close relationships between indicators of early growth and the disease incidence and the mortality of coronary heart disease in late adulthood.	1.0548314291109577
Long term effects of infant feeding on immunological functions are indicated by the effects of infant feeds on later prevalence of allergic disease and by the difference in morbidity for diabetes mellitus, Crohn's disease and malignant lymphoma between previously breast fed and formula fed infants.	1.0632698724148466
An improved understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that modulate these observed long term effects is required to enable effective preventive interventions.	1.0148793314274431
Already the available information indicates a great potential for actively improving long term child health and development by an improved substrate supply during pregnancy and infancy.	0.9293050022444639
Persons who cross international boundaries are at increased risk of contracting infectious diseases.	0.8160365164604
An analysis of the reported communicable diseases in Germany shows: A large number of cases of typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, shigella infections, trichinellosis and brucellosis notified during the last years in Germany originated from foreign countries.	1.0003571363768653
Intervention measures are necessary, above all, with regard to gastrointestinal infections and vaccine-preventable diseases.	0.8956522873902332
Bilateral testicular tumors account for approximately 3,5 % of all testicular malignancies and to our knowlegde about 800 cases are reported in the literature.	1.0207099053719708
An even more seldom event is the appearance of a testicular germ cell tumor with a contralateral benign non-germ cell tumor.	0.9163014601499473
We report the 6th case of such a coincidence.	1.2106011107159973
The dignity of a contralateral tumor should be assured by frozen section and in case of benign histology organ preserving therapy is indicated.	0.838837925964213
Even in cases of bilateral testis cancer tumor enucleation may be considered, if the strict conditions for resection and follow-up are respected.	1.006691622636291
Most sudden cardiac deaths are arrhythmic.	0.6736811137056092
Besides the known effects of beta-blockers, among true antiarrhythmic drugs only amiodarone seemed to reduce total cardiac mortality in patients at risk.	0.8640995320820595
Reevaluation of amiodarone with or without a beta-blocker in primary prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death after review of recent publications.	0.7758618213180482
Only augmentation of case numbers by meta-analyses of controlled trials could demonstrate that amiodarone not only reduces sudden cardiac death but also diminishes total cardiac mortality.	0.9300252824524937
However, the number of avoided sudden deaths is small in comparison to the number of treated cases.	1.1219390962787534
This and specific side effects of amiodarone contradict a general primary prophylaxis with this drug.	0.9983068091398627
An additional benefit by combining amiodarone with beta-blockers seems to exist but has to be proven by further studies.	0.9738788238971545
At present, primary prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death with amiodarone with or without a beta-blocker is an individual decision in all cases with special risk considerations.	0.9423232068849704
As a result of a critical review of the literature and a survey at German epilepsy centers of usual pre- and postoperative drug treatment, the following strategy is recommended:	1.3533690119375608
An ecological theory of remembering is formulated which is based on the patterns of meaningfulness in the social and spatial environment.	0.8730733205303086
The specific ecological relationship to the environment is affinitive, and also opens access to the ressources of the past.	1.0174966680620816
In the present study, conditions for this access (in particular with older people) were investigated.	1.2326639719255108
It is assumed that older people, especially, when they lose someone with whom they had a fixed relationship seek counselling and that abrupt changes in the spatial environment, such as moving to a home, are rejected by older people.	1.1385463395620694
These hypotheses were checked on the basis of material (N=120) gathered in a counselling service for the aged and they were essentially confirmed.	0.9269962451473454
To make matters clear, "typical" and thus every-day experiences of maintenance and loss of competence are cited from the material.	1.0902258300001058
Finally, practical conclusions are drawn with regard to work with the aged.	0.9934307512467458
Following Shouldice repair of a primary inguinal hernia 50 patients were given subcutaneous Redon drains, while another 50 patients underwent operations without drains in a prospective randomized trial.	1.071323703031166
The amount of postoperative wound secretion in the drainage bottle was added to fluid retention established by sonographic volumetric analysis.	0.8454540965147873
The degree of personal impairment was estimated by a visual analogue score.	0.8625658173042616
Inflammation parameters were recorded as well as the rate of complications.	1.2652652545410772
The drain group showed significantly increased fluid production in comparison to the group without drains on the 1st postoperative day (36.0 vs. 2.5 ml).	1.256697105667424
Wound sepsis was found in two patients in the drain group.	1.1276657375780577
Seven patients with drains and eight patients without underwent percutaneous seroma puncture.	0.8022660718894905
The drain only slightly affected personal impairment (25.6 % vs 21.4 %, visual analogue score).	1.2264330028523707
Body temperature was elevated in the drain group on the 3rd day after operation (37.2 vs 36.7  °C).	1.1208605567430319
We believe there is no indication for the routine use of a Redon drain in the repair of a primary inguinal hernia.	1.102133774446274
Instead, percutaneous puncture of subcutaneous fluid retentions should be performed.	0.9690821323545307
We report on three arterial thromboses of the external iliac artery following total hip replacement.	1.0825544915001588
As a result of implanted cement/spongiosa or protrusion of the acetabular component, the iliac vessels were compressed.	1.0721510581914424
Furthermore, we report about one intraoperative arterial vessel lesion in a 65-year-old patient during a revision operation.	1.3985906941771347
We recommend that in case of acute ischemic syndromes of lower limbs following total hip replacement, an angiography should be performed in order to exclude an extravascular cause of thrombosis.	1.1581175933344123
For therapy in those cases extra-anatomic bypasses should be preferred to thrombectomies.	0.8829803715200774
One of the most important occupations of manual therapists is the treatment of hypomobilities of intervertebral joints.	0.9657503616019901
Such hypomobilities of the spine are treated with different kind of manipulations or mobilisations.	1.00664365962624
The pathophysiological basis of hypomobilities is subject of discussion.	0.755769731212952
Objective criteria for the diagnosis of disturbed spinal mobility are missing.	0.8890497117471664
They are not detectable in X-ray, computertomography or NMR.	0.8562351434213377
In this article, we report on a family in which five examined members showed clinical signs of Fechtner syndrome, a condition which consists of hearing loss (49%), macrothrombocytopenia (100%), leukocyte inclusion bodies (100%), eye anomalies (54.3%), and nephritis (38.7%).	1.1437302446628805
This article describes how tissue culture has developed from an observing method to a powerful analytical technique for oncology and for pathological cell changes such as metabolic disorders and degenerative diseas es.	0.9731388968935317
Standard terms are defined and basic methods are explained.	0.768345049073687
Different models of in vitro culture - monolayer, three-dimensional tumor cultures, and organ cultures - are critically reviewed in respect of their significance for the interpret ation of in vivo tissue.	1.1673299448548913
Two important recent extensions of tissue culture, serum-free cell culture and the introduction of genetic material into cells, are described.	1.0233876824098902
The objective of this prospective, randomised study was to investigate the incidence of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting (PONV) during the first 24 h postoperatively.	1.0891887294632854
For a quality assurance study on PONV, we compared two established general anaesthetic procedures in 239 patients undergoing four different types of surgery (subtotal thyroidectomy, laparotomy for gynaecological procedures, laparoscopy, and surgery for extra-abdominal procedures).	1.0367040413015955
The historical opinion that the intima layer of a ruptured artery of muscular type could stop bleeding by "rolling in" should be controlled experimentally.	0.9676190945259944
Five segments of human femoral/popliteal artery (3-4 cm long) were overstretched until complete rupture occured.	1.185971753209271
Furthermore a longitudinally split and a partially oblique incised segment were ruptured.	0.7266772981276179
As morphological findings a sandclock deformity was observed in the region of rupture.	0.9685337691093776
This phenomenon was induced by adventitia layer, which closed the ends of ruptured media layer like a Chinese finger trap.	0.9746320936871599
In the longitudinally split segment a transverse rupture of the media layer could be observed, while the fibers of adventitia layer were pulled out when the traction was continued.	1.0082099548740544
Neither macroscopical nor microscopical signs could be found for "rolling in" of intima or media layer.	0.7355307292317919
The reason for spontaneous hemostasis after arterial rupture is more likely the activation of platelets by collagenous fibers of adventitia layer than "rolling in" of intima or media layer.	0.7913365537237764
If there is no finger trap mechanism of adventitia layer like in shot- or stabwounds a massive blood loss must be expected.	0.9890428891732383
Time and again a lack of staff in the field of people's nursing is discussed (chronic lack of nursing staff); this means that there are not enough people to do the available work) (1).	1.083309698283936
However, the time factor is also an important sociological dimension in old people's stationary care.	1.2070300060294714
First of all, this article points out the time dimension throughout life.	1.1069482909934116
This is followed by people's varying perceptions of the present and the related upsets and misunderstandings.	1.094369082120699
Hereby the contradictory abundance and limitation in time as felt by the elderly also becomes apparent.	0.8668537884885179
The old people's awareness of the dwindling remainder of their own lifespans conflicts with the seemingly endless time of each day that passes.	0.8355168852439475
Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has evolved to a research tool to an intrinsic part of modern invasive cardiology.	0.959596632689852
The main reason is the capability to obtain "in-vivo" micro anatomy by means of miniaturized echo-transducers with an outer diameter of 2.9-3.5 French.	1.152892954321299
For the first time it is possible to base decisions not only on lumenograms but also on vessel wall assessment.	1.2344621445400203
The capabilities of IVUS can be divided in its diagnostic and intervention associated potentials.	0.9594367692309894
The diagnostic strength of IVUS is the ability to monitor compensatory coronary artery enlargement as a response to arteriosclerosis, to assess intermediate lesions, to reveal occult left main stem disease, and angiographically "silent" arteriosclerosis.	1.136941019930491
In conjunction with the estimation of intracoronary flow reserve, patients with the diagnosis of coronary "syndrome X" can be better classified into those with or without early signs of arteriosclerosis.	1.1065448011162051
Additionally, IVUS is at present the only method allowing the classification of coronary artery lesions according to the AHA/ACC Stary classification.	1.138524551979987
Introduction: The chronic exertional compartment syndrome of the musculus tibialis anterior is thought to be responsible for a major part of complaints of the lower leg among active sportsmen.	1.093176244230485
There is an important role of tissue pressure measurement in diagnosing chronic anterior compartment syndrome during muscular activity.	1.211275730423674
However, there is a controversial debate about the relevant parameters.	1.1464169827962463
The development of frontal sinuses following bilateral fronto-orbital advancement is a topic of controversial discussion in the literature.	0.8343671970144665
In a retrospective study on 33 patients (15 girls and 18 boys) the development of the frontal sinus was examined radiologically.	1.1957680980206054
Only patients with a minimum age of 6 years and with at least 1 year of postoperative follow-up were included.	1.2461522861410494
The radiological reference for the frontal sinus development consisted of pneumatisation at or above the level of the supraorbital rims, as projected in postero-anterior cephalograms.	0.9427180534535843
According to these criteria a frontal sinus development was seen in 72.7% of our patients.	1.146556756493088
There was no statistically proven correlation between sinus development and the sex of the patient, age at surgery or the amount of advancement.	1.159043173154339
With the exception of severe cases of Crouzon's disease we usually expect normal development of the frontal sinus following bilateral fronto-orbital correction.	0.9946165607793763
Failures after ankle arthrodesis are, according to the literature and our own experience, more frequently seen with external fixation than with internal fixation methods.	1.1772086787072407
Favourable results can be obtained with the standard four-screw technique, preservation of the ankle and the biomechanical axes seeing only one non-union in 44 own cases with this technique.	1.126272539681151
A vital X-ray imaging technique in oral and craniomaxillofacial surgery is the panoramic X-ray.	0.9831967156045586
Due to its variety of special projections, including imaging of the transversal level and low exposure to radiation, it is suitable for answering many clinical questions and for diagnostics of various findings.	1.1260772598057345
It has become possible to minimize the necessary doses by further development of technology and devices, as well as of X-ray films and by new detection systems, such as sensors or screens.	1.133905054132526
In some clinical cases, the diagnostic deficiencies of conventional imaging techniques make computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging indispensable.	1.0070909693009384
Although MR is particularly suitable for soft tissue imaging, it has also become helpful in finding cortical changes by shorter measuring times.	1.0399233755156438
In certain cases, e. g., changes to bone metabolism, differentiated methods of nuclear medicine make image-aided analysis of function possible.	0.9330915542335552
Secondary haematogenous joint involvement is seen in less than 1 % of patients with Salmonella infections.	1.0537606970953817
These atypical infections are frequently encouraged by pre-existing local or systemic disease.	0.8787643255290337
We present a case of a patient with known alcohol abuse who developed a septic infection of her right hip requiring resection of the femoral head.	1.039687644765072
Histologic analysis showed signs of pre-existing osteonecrosis probably induced by alcohol intake.	0.7694284546067217
Cartilage and bone were invaded and destructed by an aggressive granulation tissue.	0.8297798295835273
Initially, a biopsy evaluated without knowledge of the positive bacteriological result had been interpreted as indicative of a tumour.	0.9727905877851583
The onset, clinical course, diagnosis and therapy of joint involvement by Salmonella are discussed with regard to our case and the relevant literature.	0.9821835388801229
This case illustrates the necessity for clinicians to share all their information about the patient with the pathologist.	0.9312857031183908
There are two types of diabetes mellitus.	0.8093809090635488
Type I, insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM), which becomes manifest before the age of 40, is the result of an absolute deficiency of insulin.	1.1881514854657569
Type II, the non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM), develops in the elderly and is caused by a relative insulin deficiency.	1.0535021173286834
Patients with type-I diabetes are prone to the development of ketoacidosis, while type II causes hyperglycaemic, hyperosmolar, nonketotic coma.	1.0101904526217713
Apart from these acute metabolic alterations, the long-term complications of diabetes are of concern to the anaesthesiologist.	1.0382099090791437
Hypertension, coronary artery disease, renal insufficiency and autonomic neuropathy are common and can result in myocardial ischaemia, cardiovascular instability and gastroparesis, with an increased risk of aspiration.	1.1622384686012857
Limited movement of the atlanto-occipital joint can cause difficult intubation.	0.7780568998358622
To avoid perioperative metabolic catastrophy, blood glucose concentration should be kept between 6.7 and 10 mmol - l-1 (120 - 180 mg - dl-1).	1.2032981731547496
Hypoglycaemia can result in neurological damage, whereas hyperglycaemia causes impaired wound healing and susceptibility to infections and worsens ischaemic damage to the myocardium and brain.	1.032020623061762
Perioperative diabetes management depends on the severity of the surgical procedure and the type of diabetes.	1.0135710833588372
All type-I diabetics, whatever operation being performed, need insulin.	0.9527704246953956
The intravenous route is recommended as it allows better adjustment.	0.9577087336817294
After determination of the fasting blood glucose level, insulin is given at a dosage of 0.5 - 1 U - h-1 (at gluc<11.1 mmol - l-1), 1.5 - 2 U - h-1 (at gluc 11.1 - 16.7 mmol - l-1) or 3  U - h-1 (at gluc>16.7 mmol - l-1).	1.1428058454475918
In addition, 5 - 10 g glucose - h-1 is given.	1.4525480269986046
In type-II diabetes the oral antidiabetic drug is withheld.	0.8305416566668016
During minor surgery the blood glucose concentration is monitored frequently, and if necessary insulin (with gluc>13.9 mmol - l-1) or glucose is given.	1.1615697927143316
In most cases of major surgery insulin therapy will be necessary.	0.9399988606978652
Administration should follow the guidelines listed for type-I diabetes.	0.8335436460486728
Whether the intravenous or the subcutaneous route is used for insulin, repeated glucose determinations are mandatory.	0.9256408811863717
If ketoacidosis develops the volume depletion is treated with normal saline.	0.8480479505809275
For hyperglycaemia and acidosis insulin (3 - 6 U - h-1) with 10 - 20 mmol - h-1 potassium phosphate is given.	1.28263449004651
Bicarbonate is only indicated when the serum pH is lower than 7.1.	1.0216438465648439
It must be borne in mind that perioperative management of diabetes does not end with postanaesthesia care.	0.8280190780220387
At the beginning of the 19 th century, institutional care for the insane was established by the various German states.	0.9045281770040366
At first, the separation of curable and incurable patients influenced psychiatric care and the construction of hospitals.	0.9842473247060937
The combination of care and cure in one hospital in Illenau was a turning point in institutional care.	0.9241470964143041
Contradictory tendencies characterized the second half of the 19 th century: the integration with general medicine in the cities, on the one hand, the social separation and cure in the seclusion of the countryside, on the other.	1.0586586801212838
The characteristic psychiatric construction in different countries was influenced by individual architects.	0.7250327647349792
The following building styles were dominant: in England, panoptic architecture; in the United States, linear staggered structures; in France, the "carrés isolés"; and in Germany, the structure of blocks with cross-axes.	1.173863593002606
At the end of the 19 th century, the system of pavilions was internationally accepted; occupational therapy and mental care in the countryside were introduced.	0.9205772475209469
From the First World War until the end of the 1960 s, a standstill in psychiatric buildings was noted in Germany, and institutional care came under increasing criticism.	1.0507668553389942
