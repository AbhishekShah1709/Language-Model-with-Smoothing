In 16% of cases one or both renal arteries or the inferior mesenteric or the internal iliac artery were reimplanted.	0.684834189616619
For further analysis the patients were split in three groups: elective group 1, symptomatic group 2, ruptured group 3.	0.6256390253633651
Significant differences were found in the aneurysmal diameter, distribution of gender (128 M, 14 F), renal artery involvement, or concomitant peripheral arteriosclerosis as well as for the risk factors tobacco smoking, hyperlipidemia, renal insufficiency, and the presence of multiple risk factors.	0.7629622222553318
Group 1 had a significantly higher preoperative hospital stay than group 2; whereas the intensive care stay was significantly longer in group 3 than in the other two groups.	0.6896044263727439
Sixty-four percent of patients had no, 11% had more than one complication.	0.8689822143044258
Mortality was 0 in groups 1 and 2, but 35.3% in group 3.	0.9125710164206253
The most frequent complication in groups 1 and 2 was pneumonia (13.9%) followed by cardiac complications (4.6%), and renal insufficiency (3.7%).	0.8193096674995105
In group 3 respiratory insufficiency demonstrated the highest incidence (23.5%), followed by renal insufficiency (21%) and pneumonia (17.6%).	0.6765215238912741
No patient of the nonoperated group suffered an aneurysm rupture; aneurysm diameters, except one, did not increase during the follow-up period.	0.559779776993583
Of the 130 operated and discharged patients 31 died; in no case was death related to the operative procedure.	0.5311963811487909
No important complications were observed during the follow-up of 37.2 +/- 17.9 months.	0.7370619971711218
Furthermore, the results are compared with those of the literature.	1.1514994870170563
Based on their observations the authors conclude that this retrospective quality check was rather awkward and involved giving partly incomplete data for lack of a prospective evaluation.	0.49262269408885695
Nevertheless, the results compared well with those in the literature and were satisfactory.	1.0111597178315053
We report on a 32-year-old male patient with advanced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), who had severe candidiasis of the gastrointestinal tract.	0.6246165526498324
Treatment with fluconazole, 200 mg/day, was introduced.	0.6736731210412575
After oral intake of fluconazole over 5 months itraconazole 200 mg/day was given for 1 month.	0.5108512578110243
However, fungal infection still persisted.	0.3356256062785631
The antifungal activity of fluconazole, itraconazole and ketoconazole against Candida albicans was evaluated by means of the microdilution test by determining the 90% inhibitory concentrations of each drugs.	0.5112490725121581
A high minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was detected for fluconazole (50 µg/ml) revealing fluconazole resistance.	0.6335460708331847
The susceptibility to itraconazole was borderline (MIC 0.125 µg/ml) and that to ketoconazole was markedly lowered (MIC 0.25 µg/ml).	0.5315083986851308
Plasma levels of itraconazole were also found to be lowered.	0.5947528406786347
In HIV patients the gastrointestinal absorption of azole derivatives is often reduced.	0.382354864326078
Therefore, the clinical resistance of Candida albicans to itraconazole can be explained by reduced susceptibility after azole therapy and also by the decreased absorption of the drug in HIV patients.	0.716473240656815
Patients suffering from soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities may sometimes require vascular reconstruction to remove the tumor with adequate margins of clearance.	0.5171053428221011
Besides this, recurrent lymph node metastases are often affixed to neighboring vessels.	0.5111389527837914
MRI and angiography represent the adequate diagnostic procedures.	0.36070747553468124
Vessel-invasive sarcoma can hardly be treated by surgical resection with curative intent alone.	0.5307483971766787
If there is doubt about invasion of arteries and veins, the vessels should be resected and replaced by autologous vein graft.	0.5881275865760933
Soft tissue coverage is of major importance, particularly if prosthetic grafts are used or the resection is within an area of irradiated tissue.	0.5803640631185446
After radical resection and combined modality therapy, one can expect local recurrence rates similar to those without vessel invasion.	0.5930801729820598
To achieve this goal, surgical oncologists, vascular surgeons and plastic surgeons must work together.	0.6084102854302631
Today, amputation can hardly be justified even in vessel-invasive soft tissue tumors.	0.4903605496206899

Background: Dapiprazole hydrochloride is an alpha-1-adrenergic inhibitor that anticipates the mydriatic effect of phenylephrine in dilator muscle receptors in a competitive way.	0.4207211083347477
The aim of this study was to determine for which indications for mydriasis pupil dilation by phenylephrine alone is sufficient and if the reversal by dapiprazole is convenient and the practical.	0.49036536643183337
The Quality Assurance programmes of the social security insurance authorities are presented from the point of view of psychosomatic rehabilitation.	0.6593057748551552
This presentation attempts to introduce aspects of both Quality Assurance and Quality Management into the field of medical rehabilitation.	0.5017130318471759
The consequences of the programme for political order are emphasized.	0.35959925575532437
The special features of the individual programme objectives are elaborated.	0.6258832483186774
In addition, the importance of each of these objectives for psychosomatic rehabilitation is examined.	0.5169963642145072
This field will inevitably have to adopt concepts of time and resource optimization.	0.3990123654578256
For many years the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome has been on the top of medical articles about the intensive care patient.	0.5599756878676936
While severity scores deal with the 1st ICU day physiology, the organ dysfunction systems aim to take in account the duration type and severity of physiologic disturbances during the ICU stay.	0.5055098175704442
Most of the published systems have been created by a panel of experts, giving to each dysfunction a number of points, usually 1 to 4, according to the severity.	0.6757927278452374
Only 2 systems are different: the MODS of Marshall et al.	0.4014950317289931
and the Logistic Organ Dysfunction LOD system of Le Gall et al., both published recently (1995 and 1996).	0.5314551268852662
They differ from the others because first they were created either from a literature review (MDOS) or from a logistic regression (LOD), and secondly, because neither takes into account the therapy.	0.6451125812394832
Besides, the LOD system, when used on the 1st ICU day, has statistical qualities which are very promising.	0.7462145279207442
The LOD system is now used each consecutive day on septic patients in an European multicenter study.	0.36429946334129043
The relationsship between the growth of tumors and the expression of the protooncogen Bcl-2 could be shown in epithelial tumors.	0.6346566503100908
A bcl-2 expression leads to a prolonged cell survival due to an inhibition of apoptosis.	0.5796628681870911
The potential meaning of bcl-2 expression in mesenchymal tumors remains still unknown.	0.4084021326729728
The fact, that the heterogenous group of osteosarkoma is not sufficiently characterized at present, suggested to investigate the bcl-2 expression in osteosarcoma.	0.6082100580976179
Thus, immunohistochemistry was used to analyze 47 specimens of different osteosarcomas of 36 patients.	0.6375965262804965
Sixteen cases (46 %) showed a strong expression of bcl-2 and 13 cases (35 %) were moderately positiv for bcl-2.	0.7663058497844751
Seven cases (19 %) were negative for bcl-2.	0.7265666561784675
The heterogenous, negative up to strong expression of bcl-2 yield clues, that the Bcl-2 controlled regulation of programmed cell death could be an important factor of cellular kinetics.	0.6224911889565724
Additionally the cellular proliferationrate was determined with the monoklonal antibody MIB 1, directed against the Ki-67 epitop.	0.45576889907636314
The data of bcl-2 expression and cellular proliferationrate lead to a classification correlating with the histological classification.	0.6449343568581989
To verify the importance of apoptosis in the genesis of mesenchymal tumors and whether Bcl-2 may play an important role as a predictive factor for the prognosis of osteosarcoma, further investigations will be needed.	0.6479880406963056
During a period of two weeks in hot dry midsummer 3 patients presented in our pediatric outpatient clinic after a bath in a small lake.	0.5012958455618228

Intussusception of the appendix vermiformis in adults is an uncommon event.	0.589795803144874
The combination of a mucinous cystadenoma with an intussuscepted appendix is extremely rare.	0.40196080971728076
Clinical symptoms are nonspecific; in most cases the correct diagnosis is not made before surgical exploration.	0.6912247971190199
With the radiologic and endoscopic presentation of a polypoid lesion of the caecum, a neoplasm is often considered.	0.6150367672334682
Endoscopic appendectomy or disinvagination by enema have been described.	0.2534789479216951

More than 150 years ago, hemimaxillectomies and mandibular resections as well as hemiglossectomies were already performed by leading surgeons.	0.38117900339935284
The block principle we are now following dates back to Crile, who also established the principle of cervical lymph node dissection.	0.5793236718970722
Ablative oncologic surgery has always been closely linked with plastic and reconstructive surgery, rendering radical surgical interventions possible without disfiguring patients.	0.4125647865676736
The development of facial reconstructive surgery proceeded in stages, in the first instance as secondary reconstruction using tube pedicled flaps.	0.6522076102900031
The change to the concept of primary reconstruction occurred via arterialized skin flaps and myocutaneous flaps to the widely accepted and performed free tissue transfer.	0.4557351203142271
Free bone grafting, inaugurated earlier and still representing the majority of bone grafting, has been supplemented for certain reconstructive purposes by free vascularized bone transfer from various donor sites.	0.45266295392255623
Although the five-year-survival rate of carcinoma of the oral cavity has remained unchanged in the past 30 years, distinctive improvements in tumor surgery can be recorded.	0.7420433113530182
This is primarily based on improved diagnostics such as modern imaging techniques and the refinement of surgical techniques.	0.5778026121959926
The DÖSAK has worked out distinctive guidelines for effective ablative oncologic surgery.	0.30626097232603955
Surgical approaches offering wide exposure and carrying low morbidity play a decisive role in radical resections.	0.3481232984146635
For this reason, midfacial degloving offers an essential improvement for the resection of midface tumors, especially from an aesthetic point of view.	0.5970178121488324
Tumors situated deep behind the viscerocranium at the skull base can be clearly exposed either through a lateral approach following a temporary osteotomy of the mandibular ramus or a transmandibular, transmaxillar, or transfacial approach with minimal morbidity.	0.4475782153150891
Concerning the concept of neck dissection, radical techniques are more and more abandoned in favor of a more conservative procedure.	0.5430612615930699
Actual inquiries concerning present surgical procedures as to the surgical strategy in "No-neck" or marginal and segmental resection in mandibular adherent carcinomas demand scientific clarification.	0.5458398505675154
Laser treatment of various skin changes has become common clinical practice in recent years.	0.5649589219954689
Due to its physical properties, the CO2 laser is particularly well suited for cutting and ablating tissue.	0.6505665996091435
The high absorption of its wavelength in water (=10600 nm) is responsible for its low penetration depth in biological tissue.	0.5016583062461739
Shortening the exposure time minimizes thermal side effects, such as carbonization and coagulation.	0.290098414513302
This effect can be lessened with the SilkTouch scanner, since the focussed laser beam is moved over a defined area by rapidly rotating mirrors.	0.5296824524636411
This enables a controlled and reliable removal of various dermal lesions.	0.3764929708824724
Particularly well-suited for treatment hypertrophic scars, post-acne scarring, perioral and periorbital wrinkles, rhinophymas and benign neoplasms including verruca vulgaris.	0.3576649547644487
Cosmetically favorable reepithelialization of the treated skin surfaces occurs within a very short time after treatment.	0.46476424927958454

Acute spinal cord injury affects more than 3000 individuals per year with predominantly young people between 15 and 20 years of age being involved.	0.4278925621563544
Analysis of the modern emergency management has revealed that the prognosis of acute spinal trauma depends decisively on the initial treatment at the accident site as well as good acute emergency care.	0.6491047636736668
Therefore, there is the urgent need to brain the medical staff so that injuries are diagnosed correctly and appropriate treatment be performed.	0.5792784082344644
The first hours after the accident are decisive, because injuries due to the primary and especially secondary trauma are difficult to correct later.	0.6871212803401078
Besides the fate of the individual patient, the care provider has to be aware of the high economic impact caused by intensive care, long lasting rehabilitation, as well as post rehabilitative care.	0.74409607071774
Chronic or repeated stress can induce a damage of neurons, expecially in hippocampus, by which the degree of damage differs in various species.	0.5119706777821735
Sapolski has reported that there is a correlation between hippocampal degeneration, disturbed feed-back reaction, and hypersecretion of glucocorticoids.	0.4939998735898896
The aim of this study was to investigate if the signal transmission via glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in the brain of male wistar rats of two age groups (5-6 and 17-24 months, respectively) is changed in aging and which cytoplasmic factors/modulators participate in this process.	0.7280751313688326
Introduction: The treatment of soft tissue defects of the foot and ankle region remains a challenge, because special anatomical and physiological properties have to be considered.	0.7058364035755734
Patients and methods: The data of 52 patients, who were treated between 1994 and 1998, were analyzed.	0.9378754039432332
48 % were posttraumatic defects and were located in the weight bearing zone in 37 %.	0.6556559956904195
Results: Fifty-nine procedures were used, including skin transplantation in 16 patients, local flaps in 3 cases, regional flaps in 14 cases, and microvascular procedures in 17 cases.	0.7216781554503524
Amputation was required in 4 patients.	0.5571137958440155
The overall success rate was 92 %.	0.4216747796896727
Complications occurred in 18 patients.	0.4346777361709743
Conclusions: Using these data and evaluation of the actual literature lead to the development of an algorithm for the treatment of defects in this area.	0.7867977669087918
The modern armamentarium of plastic surgery offers the possible different treatment modalities.	0.40114410776153847

APC resistance was first discovered in 1993.	0.3083310470187668
It is the most frequent cause of thrombophilia in Europe and North America.	0.6851826295394393
In more than 90% of cases, the underlying cause of APC resistance is a single point mutation in the factor V gene.	0.7238983861330077
Heterozygous patients have a between five- and ten-fold higher risk of developing venous thrombosis, while in homozygous patients the risk is increased up to between 50- and 100-fold.	0.7921201985104174
Where there is a previous history of thrombosis, a careful investigation of the coagulation system, in particular a determination of the APC ratio, is recommended prior to surgery.	0.8545556038569724
In patients with APC resistance, a body-weight-specific thrombosis prophylaxis with heparin is recommended.	0.6750254947764116
Heterozygous patients only need anticoagulation when additional risk conditions are present, while homozygous patients with thromboembolic disease should be anticoagulated over a long period of time.	0.5410315410666242
Primary varicosis of the saphenous system should be treated promptly by surgery to minimize the additional risk of thrombotic complications.	0.5327267936402601
Pyomyositis is an acute bacterial infection with abscess formation in the skeletal muscles mostly due to Staphylococcus aureus.	0.4726658116220401
The disease is found more often in males.	0.6984101463008274
Since the patients symptoms and the clinical and laboratory findings are relatively unspecific, the clinical diagnosis of pyomyositis can present difficulties.	0.9847433462922505
Furthermore, cases of pyomyositis are rare in non-tropical countries and some physicians may not be familiar with it.	0.6061906531582337
If not diagnosed and treated properly, pyomyositis can lead to sepsis and death.	0.4422360519105405
Although the pathogenesis of the disease has not yet been clarified, some predisposing factors of forensic interest are well known: (trivial) trauma or vigorous exercise of the affected skeletal muscles, small potentially "septic" foci in other tissues or internal organs and a preexisting immunodeficiency, e. g. in diabetes mellitus, intravenous drug abusers or individuals suffering from HIV.	0.6495334785576914
Three cases of "non-tropical" pyomyositis with fatal outcome are presented and the literature on the subject is reviewed with special reference to epidemiological and etiological factors, taking forensic aspects, histomorphologic findings and the problems of post-mortem diagnosis of pyomyositis into consideration.	0.6901437141514376
Aim of the study: The etiology of persistent crying during early infancy has been only insufficiently elucidated.	0.5721596059909437
Based upon recent data from the "Munich Interdisciplinary Research and Intervention Program (MIRIP)", this paper shall discuss and challenge well known explanatory models.	0.5790285434076561
In addition, novel approaches of intervention shall be presented.	0.32280465355624977
Because tumour cell invasion is a three-dimensional process involving tumour cells as well as stromal cells, tumour invasion models should include equivalents of both compartments in a spatially defined organisation.	0.5035068363726195
Aims: Evaluation of differentiation and invasive potential in relation to basement membrane (BM) formation of new human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines under the influence of fibromatosis fibroblasts in a 3D co-culture system (collagen type I/fibroblast-containing matrix).	0.47569926870044393
Material and methods: OSCC cell lines were established and cultured on collagen type I matrix with and without the inclusion of fibro-/myofibroblasts derived from nodular palmar fibromatosis).	0.472906959679533
Evaluation of invasion was done by conventional H & E staining after paraffin embedding; immunohistochemistry was performed for cytokeratins (MNF 116), involucrin (Sy5), vimentin (V9), collagen type IV (CIV22), laminin (1-chain, 4C7), and Ki-67 (MIB1); and electron microscopy followed.	0.6032590268608764
Results: The OSCC cell lines PE/CA-PJ15, PE/CA-PJ34, PE/CA-PJ41 were invasive exclusively on gels containing fibroblasts with stratification of the multilayerd OSCC cell coat and polarised expression of cytokeratin and involucrin.	0.3672914888184112
There was no evidence for BM, either by immunohistochemistry or by electron microscopy, although OSCC are immunohistochemically positive for collagen type IV and laminin in the 2D cell culture.	0.5816689652239607
There were no differences in proliferative activity of the gels with and without fibroblasts.	0.5809323143687041
Conclusions: Carcinoma cell invasion depends on the presence of fibroblasts in the gel indicating the important role of tumor stromal fibro-/myofibroblasts during carcinomic invasion.	0.5295413660360901
The absence of a BM does not, per se, imply an invasive tumour growth.	0.4464519515532766
Moreover, stratification and terminanl differentiation of epithelial tumour cells occur independently of a structural BM.	0.40214035388772124
Interfragmentary movement and size of the fracture gap influence fracture healing.	0.6133288289753199
Limited movements promote callus formation and may result in increased mechanical stability.	0.4585375409693977
Although larger movements still promote callus formation, the bony consolidation of the fracture is hampered.	0.7062240802084447
Fracture healing is also hampered if the size of the fracture gap is too large.	0.6500556143250196
A combination of large movement and large gap bears the risk of non-union.	0.5032151659246877
Therefore, having in mind a minimally invasive surgical approach, one should strive for good reduction of the fracture ends and flexible yet stable osteosynthesis.	0.6626055978764337
Dynamization of the fracture by enabling axial movement will close the fracture gap, stimulate tissue differentiation and possibly accelerate the healing process.	0.51452781500963
External mechanical stimulation, however, has not been shown to effectively enhance the healing process under flexible fixation or in load-bearing patients.	0.61165788598238
Although ketamine has been in clinical use for 3 decades, the neuropharmacological basis of its analgesic, anaesthetic, sympathomimetic, and psychotomimetic effects is still a subject of controversial discussion and intensive investigational efforts.	0.62586049310661
In recent years, however, new experimental approaches to its effects on the cellular and molecular level and the availability of pure ketamine enantiomers contributed substantially to the understanding of its complex neuropharmacology.	0.56101745748382
This article reviews the current knowledge of ketamine effects on ligand-operated and voltage-operated transmembrane ion channels, G-protein-coupled receptors, transmitter uptake, and the NO-cGMP system in neurons.	0.5861642996339089
With regard to its potential clinical relevance and supposed relative role among the complex mechanisms involved in pain perception, analgesia, anaesthesia, and psychotomimesis, the contributions of recent experimental and clinical findings to the identification of major target sites of ketamine are summarised.	0.6455227988136274
In contrast to the uncertainty surrounding the potential role of opioid receptors, there is now considerable evidence that NMDA antagonism is a central mechanism that contributes to the amnesic, analgesic, anaesthetic, and psychotomimetic as well as the neuroprotective actions of ketamine.	0.6116093582064096
Moreover, the involvement of non-NMDA glutamate receptors, muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic transmission, interactions with 5-HT receptors, and L-Type Ca2+ channels may account for some of its anaesthetic and neuroprotective properties.	0.6071639282575619
There is undoubtedly a need for a safe disinfection method of optical instruments used by ENT specialists.	0.5084987366033764
So far, a standard method that sufficiently covers the risk of infection for patients and medical staff alike while serving the need of practicability in daily routine has not been established.	0.7160037598439636
Therefore, in the ENT departments of the hospitals of Mannheim, Kaiserslautern, and Tübingen, studies on the disinfection of rigid optical instruments without working channel were performed between February 1999 and May 1999.	0.6576771381873664
Instruments were wiped either with an aldehyde or alcohol (ethanol 80%) and germs were detected by quantitative swab cultures.	0.5092444948917959
As discussed in the article, disinfection with ethanol proved to be at least equally efficient if not better than disinfection with aldehyde.	0.4891472157465441
Therefore, it fully serves the requirements of a safe method for disinfection optical instruments without working channels.	0.5819831984241916
White piedra is a rare hair infection of man and certain animals, caused by the widespread Trichosporon fungi.	0.5957458746954795
The infection is characterized clinically by whitish, soft and easily removable coating of the hair shafts; however, the shafts may be destroyed by the pathogens invading at localized points.	0.5057122443077338
While all body hair may be affected, the pubic hair is most frequently affected.	0.5720054222390145
This paper is the first report genital white piedra in a 34-year-old Central European man.	0.614074249528851
In all, 22 cases have been described world-wide in young men ranging in age from 20 to 40 years.	0.6184706615827785
Only 2 men, aged 42 and 53 years, do not fall in this range.	0.4788416240173689
Recently, a major African study disclosed this disease in women for the first time.	0.61918239421201
In moderate latitudes, however, this infection appears to occur almost exclusively in young men.	0.5165013094797504
In open fractures the rate of infected non-union defects has in recent years decreased due to the increased primary application of external fixation.	0.5963649707438812
In spite of this positive state of affairs the condition is still encountered often enough to warrant specific treatment strategies and techniques.	0.4692972035818182
In the treatment of infected pseudarthroses the general principles of osteitis treatment are applied.	0.38951798498152
This includes radical excision of infected pseudarthrotic bone and of the diseased surrounding soft tissue, provides mechanical stability in the non-union area and requires effective local treatment of the infection in combination with systemic, target-specific and temporary well-defined antibiotic therapy as well as procedures to improve local circulation.	0.6634785678470548
The incorporation of autogenous bone transplants in defects appears to depend on close contact between the transplant and the vascularized receiving site and on the quantity of the transplanted osseous material.	0.5119181855236322
A promising alternative method of dealing with extensive bone defects is osteogenesis produced by callus distraction; therefore special attention is given to Ilizarov's ring fixation system.	0.46789788527041176
Unstable scar formation demands local muscular flaps or microvascularized free flap transfer, which seems to be superior to other methods.	0.5426131694990934
Aim of the study: Using phantom studies, a dedicated low-field MR system with 0.2 T and a whole-body MR-scanner with 1.0 T were compared.	0.8130985525767139
Many different mechanisms contribute to the etiopathogenesis of the so-called diabetic foot syndrome.	0.4651745579570763
Among chronic complications, the diabetic foot syndrome is one of the most frequent causes of hospitalization.	0.6515943508719063
The relative risk of diabetic patients requiring an amputation is up to 45 times greater than in normal subjects.	0.38112230650104867
Sensory neuropathy, ischemia, and infection are the principal pathogenetic factors in the diabetic foot syndrome.	0.5596316537618401
In most cases, a painless trauma is the initial condition that leads to an ulcer.	0.5926783664404804
In this article, an overview of the different causes, clinical manifestations, and treatment options for a multidisciplinary team are discussed.	0.8765944173737814
Lung resection offers the best prospect of long-term survival in patients with nonmetastatic pulmonary neoplasia.	0.57878494664034
In view of the dismal prognosis of unresected bronchial cancer, surgical resection should be encouraged even in patients with reduced cardiopulmonary function.	0.6160229106074292
Accurate estimation of the postoperative cardiopulmonary function is therefore desirable to avoid (a) refusal of potentially curative treatment and (b) severe postoperative disability.	0.5820451878191604
The origins of postresection morbidity and mortality are multifactorial.	0.462731773285061
Thus, no single pulmonary function test or hemodynamic measurement can accurately and reliably predict postoperative cardiorespiratory complications.	0.46881608933723784
Criteria of functional operability should be based on percent of predicted value, so that patient's age, sex, and height will be taken into consideration.	0.5756654498351101
Exercise testing offers the advantage that both pulmonary and cardiac risk can be evaluated simultaneously.	0.5172440228225953
The high predictive value of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) in assessing postoperative morbidity and mortality is established.	0.644981101520875
The calculation of predicted postoperative lung function (ppo) is of importance.	0.6306227090942931
The postoperative values for the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1-ppo), the transfer factor (TL,CO-ppo), and VO2max-ppo can be predicted by using the same formula.	0.6338650756217105
Patients with nearly normal lung function (FEV1, TL,CO > 75 % predicted) and no concomitant cardiac disease can undergo lung resection right up to pneumonectomy without further diagnostic procedures.	0.6622283164984556
In the others, FEV1-ppo and TL,CO-ppo should be estimated first by taking into account the number of segments to be resected.	0.5104083465999285
Patients with values < 30 % predicted are usually regarded as being inoperable, whereas values > 40 % predicted qualify for resection without the need for further diagnostics.	0.7479088375357661
VO2max < 10 ml/kg/min or < 40 % predicted are prohibitive for surgery.	0.739893021103834
If VO2max is > 20 ml/kg/min or > 75 % predicted, functional operability without limitation is given.	0.7019878532459852
For those cases where diagnostic uncertainty still remains, FEV1-ppo, TL,CO-ppo, and VO2max-ppo can be calculated by means of quantitative lung scans.	0.4928560222461529
Patients with either FEV1-ppo and TL,CO-ppo < 30 % predicted or VO2max-ppo < 8 ml/kg/min or < 35 % predicted are deemed inoperable.	0.7052348543418121
The treatment of acute of Achilles tendon rupture experienced a dynamic development in the last ten years.	0.6797222271122796
Decisive for this development was the application of MRI and above all the ultrasonography in the diagnostics of the pathological changes and injuries of tendons.	0.6149124721405596
The question of ruptue morphology as well as different courses of healing could be now evaluated objectively.	0.4490205670866945
These advances led consequently to new modalities in treatment concepts and rehabilitation protocols.	0.3778814211122715
The decisive input for improvements of the outcome results and particularly the shortening of the rehabilitation period came with introduction of the early functional treatment in contrast to immobilizing plaster treatment.	0.6050247162425929
In a prospective randomized study (1987-1989) at the Trauma Dept.	0.8701959740682097
of the Hannover Medical School could show no statistical differences comparing functional non-operative with functional operative therapy with a special therapy boot (Variostabil/Adidas).	0.4914943162217889
The crucial criteria for therapy selection results from the sonografically measured position of the tendon stumps in plantar flexion (20  °).	0.6029398251684531
With complete adaptation of the tendons' ends surgical treatment does not achieve better results than non-operative functional treatment in term of tendon healing and functional outcome.	0.5045938774827925
Regarding the current therapeutic standards each method has is advantages and disadvantages.	0.4259404162289483
Both, the operative and non-operative functional treatment enable a stable tendon healing with a low risk of rerupture (1-2 %).	0.7846458921663144
Meanwhile there is consensus for early functional aftertreatment of the operated Achilles' tendons.	0.40869189665069283
There seems to be a trend towards non-operative functional treatment in cases of adaquate sonografical findings, or to minimal invasive surgical techniques.	0.7578033458298766
Based on a case report, we offer brief guidelines on the perioperative management of patients with Sleep-Apnea-Syndrome (SAS) who present with a high incidence of a difficult airway and a high risk of respiratory depression during the perioperative period.	0.8072392777835531
A 39 year old male patient with a body mass index of 34,22 kg/m2 and receiving continuous-positive-airway-pressure- (CPAP) therapy for known SAS was scheduled for elective plastic surgery.	0.6996478454285864
After induction of anaesthesia and direct laryngoscopy no adequate airway could be established and the patient became hypoxic, hypercapnic and developed hypotension and bradycardia.	0.6148794048439666
With the use of a laryngeal mask airway the patient was stabilized and did not show neurologic sequale after immediate awakening.	0.6535920342079918
The following fiberoptic intubation of the awake patient, still showing tendency of upper airway obstruction, confirmed the difficult anatomical structures.	0.5161875594110021
The subsequent general anesthesia was uneventful.	0.27751004963343195
The patient received CPAP therapy and was monitored during the first postoperative night in the Intensive Care Unit.	0.6541440630125503
He made an uneventful recovery.	0.1882742808514887
He was advised to have regional anaesthesia or planned fiberoptic intubation, where possible, in the case of further anesthetic intervention.	0.6154994498037817
SAS has major implications for the anaesthesiologist and whenever patients exhibiting the high risk factors (obesity, male sex, history of intense snoring, impaired daytime performance, nonrefreshing daytime naps) are presented for surgery this condition should be considered.	0.6181131665060671
Elective surgery should be postponed until after adequate examination and treatment when necessary.	0.4310594978131364
Patients with SAS should always be suspected of having cardiopulmonary dysfunctions such as hypertension, cardiac dysrhythmia or cor pulmonale.	0.44784722696008217
It is most important to avoid sedative premedication, to initiate CPAP therapy preoperatively, to encourage regional anaesthesia if possible and to ensure close monitoring over the complete perioperative period.	0.6289984728505285
Planned fiberoptic intubation, preferably with surgical personnel available for an emergency airway, is a safe method for the induction of anaesthesia.	0.7615708775045886
Postoperatively, patients are at high risk from respiratory depression, even in the awake state.	0.8610086438665946
Postoperative opioid analgesia, no matter what route, should only be given under close monitoring.	0.6146867596643798
Independently of regional or general anaesthesia there is an increased risk of respiratory depression in the middle of the first postoperative week, suspected to be caused by the catching up on lost REM-sleep, due to shifts in the normal sleep pattern during the first postoperative days.	0.7308477986226601
Life style measures (weight reduction and control, reduction of total fat calories to <30% of total calories, modification of fat intake to increased monounsaturated vegetable fat, increased intake of dietary fibers, increased physical activity, controlled stress relaxation) are the basis of longterm therapy of coronary heart disease.	0.662808717610858
For transformation to daily life both patient and doctor need motivation, information, patience, and realistic aimes.	0.502858662770043
For realization the 10 rules of medical information should be followed.	0.4535248163039893
The patient must be informed that the "new lifestyle" is not punishing but means a new quality of life.	0.7112288212975315
With respect to the most important metabolic syndrome with hyperinsulinemia due to insulin resistance, weight reduction is the most important measure for preventing complications of atherosclerosis.	0.6922136019187648
The patient should use a diary for weight control and blood pressure selfmeasurement.	0.44686714164036384
IOL implantation in childhood is still controversial.	0.394495584368876
Background: Increases in serum calcium are often detected by chance.	0.44453688091294047
They warrant a prompt diagnostic work-up to identify the underlying cause.	0.6460644172518082
In the present review we describe our experience with debridement in necrotizing pancreatitis, with particular emphasis on the indications for surgery and the outcome in patients with infected and sterile necrosis.	0.9198495606129315
Within 7 years 64 patients with necrotizing pancreatitis underwent surgery with a median preoperative APACHE II score of 9.	0.5479866579851989
The indications for surgery were either proven infection or persistence of symptoms.	0.5280118028739943
Thirty-six patients were found to have infected necrosis, while 28 patients had sterile necrosis.	0.7349204314277574
There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding pre- and postoperative parameters.	0.8588260991834064
The surgical technique involved a blunt necrosectomy followed by closed packing with Penrose drains.	0.4167691193934495
This technique produced the lowest reported mortality of 6.2 % with a reoperation rate of only 17 %, demonstrating that even with sterile necrosis surgical management can be carried out safely.	0.6967907320378034
The incidence of postoperative myocardial infarction (MI) is proportional to the incidence of myocardial ischaemic episodes.	0.6278184194977561
Therefore, the prevention of such episodes is of great clinical importance.	0.6732855498086388
The absorption of large volumes of irrigation fluid is a major problem in transurethral prostatic surgery (TUR-P).	0.5415901138854734
Various indicators have been tested to monitor fluid absorption with regard to continuous registration and sufficient accuracy.	0.406651373893654
The volumetric fluid balance is not suitable as a routine method because of its inaccuracy.	0.5857082789719252
Easily accessible parameters are unspecific because of surgical bleeding (haematocrit [Hct]), or are interfered with by physiological counter-regulatory actions (serum sodium [Na] concentration).	0.42284500748952286
In 1986 Hulten et al.	0.16384534449127222
suggested adding 2% ethanol to the irrigation fluid as a marker and investigated it intermittently in the expired air with an alcohol-test appliance.	0.5004654854943943
In a prospective clinical study of 17 patients undergoing TUR-P under spinal anaesthesia, expiratory concentrations of alcohol that was added to the irrigation fluid (2% ethanol in Purisole, Fresenius, Bad Homburg) were monitored.	0.7575716337286709
Gas was continuously sampled from the nasopharynx through a nasal cannula and the ethanol concentration was measured using a modified diverting anaesthetic gas monitor (Normac, Datex, Helsinki) that allows continuous as well as early detection of the absorbed irrigation fluid with reliable accuracy for clinical use.	0.5111020032479673
In addition, at intervals of 10 minutes we measured blood alcohol, endtidal alcohol (Alcotest 7110, Drauml;ger, Lübeck), haematocrit, serum Na concentration, and blood gases.	0.557288379682918
Sixty-eight measurements were obtained from the 17 patients.	0.4975998092303048
As shown in other studies, serum Na (r2 = 0.68) and Hct (r2 = 0.39) correlated poorly with the irrigation fluid as determined by serum alcohol levels.	0.5143091304303377
In contrast, the expiratory alcohol measurements with the alcotest 7110 (r2 = 0.93) and Normac devices (r2 = 0.85) were closely related.	0.6203870380298178
Continuous monitoring of the expiratory alcohol concentration with a Normac monitor closely reflects blood alcohol concentrations, and may hence serve as a useful semiquantitative monitor of irrigation fluid absorption during TUR-P.	0.5646275310234004
Between 1986 and 1996, 21 patients had a tibiocalcanear arthrodesis.	0.5736751156814102
Indications for surgery were in all cases either osteomyelitis or avascular necrosis of the talus.	0.7143046983325599
External stabilisation was used in 17 patients due to severe soft tissue damage or extensive infection of the talus, internal screw fixation was used in four patients.	0.8472449380569682
There were eight complications in seven patients, one patient had a below the knee amputation.	0.7664199235763228
The leg length discrepancies after resection of the talus was equalised in four cases with callus distraction using an Ilisarov ring fixator.	0.6879806816194131
Follow up evaluation was available in 18 patients after an average of 38 months (12-86 mo.).	0.6637200163882099
There were no infectious recurrenies during the follow up period and a solid fusion was achieved in all patients that were followed.	0.861804142372878
According to a modified Kitaoka score, results were excellent and good in 12 of the 18patients.	0.697769884711338
External stabilisation, especially the Ilisarov ring fixator is the primary method of treatment in cases with severe infection or soft tissue damage.	0.8875920796453038
Intraoperative autotransfusion (MAT), preoperative autologous blood donation, and preoperative normovolaemic haemodilution are three different methods to avoid homologous blood transfusion during surgical procedures.	0.5101867042866031
The controversial use of MAT via cell saver in tumour surgery as well as contamination of the operative field with urine illustrate the particular difficulties of autologous blood transfusion in connection with radical prostatectomy.	0.5271521303953616
We investigated changes in the osmotic resistance of the retransfused red blood cells (RBC), bacterial contamination, changes in coagulation parameters, and the presence of tumour cells.	0.6397495494399049
Orbital pseudotumor is a nonspecific inflammatory process of unknown etiology that can be divided histopathologically into three basic types: granulomatous, lymphoid, and sclerosing.	0.6259114913767033
Between 1995 and 1998, 12 patients with pseudotumor orbitae were treated in the ENT Department of the University of Saarland.	0.7128955013739496
Histopathological examination showed granulomatous type of pseudotumor in six, lymphoid in three, and sclerosing in three patients.	0.5957152864796119
In seven cases the pseudotumor orbitae were medially located and in four cases laterally.	0.4645624923656724
In one patient nearly all orbital structures were infiltrated.	0.4839810506372387
A number of different mapping systems have been published for the lymph-node staging in lung cancer.	0.5849319685884141
The use of a reproducible map is an essential prerequisite for correct determination of the TNM status and comparing the surgical results.	0.6914309370859191
In order to evaluate the current status of lymph-node mapping and lymph-node dissection in Germany, we performed a mail survey involving 90 hospitals performing operations for lung cancer.	0.6521806733122186
Responses were obtained from 61 (67.7 %) hospitals.	0.6285051775001231
Currently, the majority of the departments (43 %) use the German staging system (according to the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Thorax-, Herz- und Gefäßchirurgie/Pneumologie), 23 % lymph-node mapping according to Naruke, and 25 % an individual description of the resected lymph nodes.	0.7160708181288965
The number of resected lymph nodes is reported in 75 % of the departments, the quotient of involved/not involved lymph nodes in 33 %.	0.7847211395315095
Mediastinal lymph-node sampling guided by the intraoperative aspect of lymph nodes is performed in 59 % of the departments.	0.7377100935043203
A systematic mediastinal "en-bloc" resection is accomplished in 41 %.	0.4445720861638054
The results of this survey represent the current status of lymph-node mapping and lymphadenectomy in lung cancer in Germany and might be useful for the development of a uniform staging system.	0.7092989436459147
In a 4-year period two right-sided empyemas occurred following a total of 39 pneumonectomies for lung cancer.	0.6052337931925676
In another case pneumonectomy was performed for left-sided lung cancer with concomitant empyema as an emergency procedure in a patient referred from an outside hospital.	0.6567080419806784
Empyema was treated with repeated thoracoscopic debridements and intermittent lavage with polyvinylpyrrolidine-iodine solution and streptocinase/streptodornase.	0.36347647392400484
Three to seven thoracoscopies were required to sterilize the pleural cavity.	0.2661103332455875
After a median follow-up of 14 months all three patients are well and without any evidence of infection.	0.6376012101939684
VATS is suitable for definitive treatment of postpneumonectomy empyema and is associated with excellent functional and cosmetic results.	0.43067676754933315
Injuries to the spine and the spinal cord are an important problem.	0.7508611215229474
In the present paper the application of external transpedicular fixation of the spinal column for surgical treatment of patients in the acute phase of spinal cord injuries is described.	0.989848912475459
The results of treatment obtained in 54 patients in the acute phase are presented.	0.7440840445015391
Decompression of the spinal cord can be accomplished by way of a dorsal approach.	0.6246097088045238

Objectives: Children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or non-hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) show retarded growth.	0.616239679286677
The question arose as to whether proportionate catch-up growth follows.	0.4046178611834057
Background: The fundus autofluorescence imaging technique has been modified allowing improved image resolution (768 x 572 pixel).	0.42612417217254844
We present results of fundus autofluorescence studies using this technique.	0.33017726526655244
Certain intra-articular fractures of the knee can be managed by arthroscopically assisted reduction and  fixation.	0.6243023356370218
The known benefits of arthroscopy include better visualization of the entire joint, limited dissection, and thorough irrigation.	0.6350005589440202
The purpose of this paper is to present our experience with arthroscopically assisted reduction and fixation of certain intra-articular fractures of the knee.	0.7614120572508452
From May 1995 to November 1997, 34 patients with intra-articular fractures of the knee were treated by arthroscopic reduction and fixation.	0.7546975915931987
We treated 11 patients with tibial plateau fracture type I, II and III (according to J. Schatzker classification), 20 patients with avulsion fracture of the tibial insertion of the anterior cruciate ligament (intercondylar eminence) type II, III and IV (according to Meyers, McKeever and Zariczny classification), two patients with completely dislocated osteochondral flake fractures of the femoral condyle, and one patient with a minimally displaced fracture of the patella.	0.7156166334737811
Postoperatively they were all allowed passive motion exercises.	0.2785763756682368
Patients with avulsion fractures of the ACL and the patient with fracture of the patella were allowed immediate weight bearing, while patients with tibial plateau fractures and osteochondral fractures were allowed weight bearing only after 12 weeks.	0.7462948336618785
Results: Of the 11 tibial plateau fractures, 8 were anatomically reduced, and in 2 the dislocation was less than 2 mm.	0.9597463013917317
No further dislocation of the fragment followed.	0.5542494009798662
All patients but one reported stable knees and they all had a full range of motion at follow-up.	0.43902614346776697
Of the 20 patients with avulsion fracture of the anterior cruciate ligament, 19 were anatomically reduced.	0.5768337703264894
Except in one patient, functional results were excellent (KT1000 was 1.3 mm, average loss of flexion was 2.5 °, loss of extension was 1.3 °).	0.7968435847566252
In two cases of osteochondral fractures of the femoral condyle, reduction was anatomical.	0.8878725934629581
The fractures healed, the patients were free of pain and had full ROM at the follow-up.	0.7764148122967449
The fracture of the patella healed in 4 weeks with full ROM of the knee.	0.5908513524064759
There was one case of aseptic synovitis and no other major complications.	0.673177394797994
Conclusions: Arthroscopic reduction and fixation are technically possible in certain types of intra-articular fractures of the knee.	0.5486438466780832
Provided indications are good, results of arthroscopic treatment are better than in classical surgical treatment through arthrotomy.	0.586747577431793
There is less postoperative morbidity, and hospitalization and total rehabilitation times are shorter.	0.5717857387599815
Some technical hints are presented.	0.19374740476499208
A healthy 38-year-old woman suffered a sudden cardiac arrest 2 days after a vaginal hysterectomy.	0.6714579254456965
Although standard cardiac life support (CPR) was instituted immediately after the event, it was not possible to re-establish a spontaneous circulation for about 40 min.	0.7161713399672821
Systemic intravenous thrombolytic therapy with slow injection of 1.5 million IU urokinase was performed as a final life-maintaining measure because of the high probability that the underlying cause was a pulmonary embolus; 10 min later (after 60 min of ongoing CPR) the patient regained a stable circulation.	0.799161400324713
She survived without neurological deficit in spite of the long duration of CPR.	0.5889932152352093
In 348 patients with an initial diagnosis of rectal carcinoma operated on between 1985 and 1994 we investigated the quality of lymph node dissection, its influence on the perioperative risk and tumor staging.	0.8284778588450338
The same histopathological work-up was carried out in all cases.	0.7676026844062486
Whether resections or extirpations were performed, the number of dissected lymph nodes increased from 5.3 and (1985/1986) to 16.7 and 17.3 (1991/1992) and to 15.8 and 17.3 (1993/1994) respectively.	0.8934764783683551
Neither the type of operation nor the surgeon's experience had a significant influence on the number of lymph nodes dissected.	0.650084659450157
The increase in the number of lymph nodes dissected had no negative effect on the length of the operation, the amount of blood infused during the operation or the perioperative risk.	0.7804991590273658
We found a significant correlation between the number of lymph nodes dissected and the number of lymph node metastases (P = 0.02) and between an increase in UICC stage III (P = 0.005) and pN2 tumors (P = 0.000) and an increase in the number of lymph nodes dissected.	0.8205829766540743
Central lymph node dissection by high ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery did not increase the perioperative risk in spite of the fact that in recent years we have observed more patients with multiple diseases.	0.7831066418014606
With the institution of the Protection against infection Act, case definitions will be officially introduced for the routine transmission of notifiable infectious diseases from local health departments to state and national health institutions in Germany for the first time.	0.4755748775834652
Case definitions link the disease entity with a defined description of the disease.	0.4897124321957507
The abstraction thereby required leads to the creation of nosological entities.	0.33831263281477136
The case definitions, which were developed by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) according to the Protection against infection Act, enable the local health departments to assess and categorise reported cases, deaths and laboratory reports of pathogens according to uniform criteria prior to transmission to the RKI via the state health institutions.The quality of surveillance data will be significantly improved, as each reported case/infection will fulfil defined criteria, thereby enabling unclear cases/diagnoses to be separated from those that are confirmed.	0.5597020456775138
Endosseous osseointegrated implants have become an integral part of the treatment scheme for the prosthetic reconstruction and rehabilitation of masticatory function following scientific studies of the reactions between implant and soft and hard tissues.	0.5698176471733571
Furthermore, implants offer good chances for prosthetic rehabilitation in the insufficient bone site, if the extremely atrophic jaw is to be reconstructed by grafting procedures with avascular and vascular grafts, by guided bone regeneration, by distraction osteogenesis, by bone substitutes and in the future by osteoinductive proteins in order to prepare the conditions for implant insertion.	0.6820637560879709
Those reconstruction procedures combined with implants become often necessary, if  complicated hard and soft tissue defects of the skull have to be reconstructed to create the prerequisites for the stabilisation of epitheses or to insert implant-supported devices.	0.5900675895554163
A 58-year-old woman was initially externally diagnosed in 1983 with a presacral mass, which was subsequently treated as an abcess.	0.7184457986774291
Thereafter, the patient experienced recurrent perianal fistulas.	0.867566527418329
Further diagnostic studies revealed a cystic tumor, considered to be an epidermoid cyst, which was located in the inferior pelvis and was consequently removed.	0.7300527342965744
Histologically, cystic scar tissue was found with a highly differentiated adenocarcinoma which measured 4 cm.	0.5933132530931642
Later on, the patient again experienced perianal fistulas originating from a renewed presacral mass.	0.6417437093623282
As a result, an abdominal-perianal rectum extirpation and a partial resection of the sacrum with placement of a descendostomy were done.	0.6098953500365683
Histologically, adenocarcinoma tissue was found at the base of a tail-gut cyst.	0.5653874469426964
One year following her operation, the patient is free from any complaints and relapses.	0.8005535136972434
The tail-gut cyst is a very rare entity which arises from the inadequate involution of the tail-gut during embryonal development.	0.4467466244764852
A malignant transformation occurs in 10 % of the cases.	0.5921861664847339
In the case of recurrent perianal fistulas and cystic masses between the rectum and os sacrum or os coccygeum, a tail-gut cyst should be taken into consideration, the goal being its complete removal.	0.573629320800081
The German Social Law has required quality assurance (QA) procedures since 1989.	0.41100455566770205
The measures must be suitable to allow "comparing investigations".	0.38608927113676705
In 1992 the German Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine published recommendations for QA in anaesthesia: most problems during an anaesthetic should be documented in a standardised manner, and thus, a list of 63 pitfalls, events, and complications (PECs) and five degrees of severity were defined.	0.6938893295815822
The goal of this study was to determine the frequency of PECs in anaesthesia and to correlate PECs with procedures and preoperative health status.	0.5763159942380244
Using the diary method, the correlation between daily mood and everyday activities is analyzed.	0.5084138222315584
Positive and negative affect were used as indicator of daily mood.	0.5168987556080654
Duration of social activities and resting during the day were used as indicator of daily activities.	0.5421623320366519
A total of 55 elderly persons kept a activity and mood diary for at least 50 days.	0.4647983509858564
The data were analyzed interindividually (using regression analyses) and intraindividually (using time series analyses).	0.7418884723773914
While positive affect and duration of social activities correlate positively in both inter- and intraindividual perspective, there is a relationship between negative affect and duration of rest only in interindividual perspective.	0.5689450463271712
Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.	0.734112800760905
Purpose: Regional hyperthermia in combination with chemotherapy or/and radiotherapy is a promising treatment concept for locally advanced, deep-seated tumors.	0.5941526177057697

The purpose of the Transfusion Law, which came into force on 7 July 1998, is to ensure the supply with safe blood products, to reinforce the confidence in the blood transfusion system, and to support self sufficiency with blood and plasma.	0.7578835526179922
In order to reach this goal, the law regulates the essential reqirements for the adequate collection of blood and blood constituents, as well for safe usage of blood products.	0.6790710614159291
Moreover it lays down rules for look-back procedures, prescribes the collection of data on the epidemiology in donor populations, creates a legal basis for the advisory group 'Arbeitskreis Blut', and fosters the self sufficiency with blood and plasma by several prescriptions.	0.4849354387734959
In the last decades back pain has reached dramatic proportions in industrialized countries.	0.6120343818990378
Disorders of the back are nowadays the leading cause of direct and indirect health care costs.	0.43819136795460306
Accurate prevalence estimates are needed to serve as a basis for health care evaluations.	0.5043250588974563
A review of epidemiologic studies in the general population reveals that back pain has reached a prevalence of 40 % for current pain.	0.7432042612823
7 to 18 % are "frequently", "often", "daily" or "constantly" affected.	0.7473988071675469

Back pain has a prevalence maximum at 50 to 64 years.	0.4479420456724022
Older persons display lower prevalence estimates.	0.19949729601810567
The prevalence maximum in men is one decade earlier than in women.	0.36558017789121877
There are several potential explanations for this prevalence pattern that are discussed in the article.	0.6238705761811256
Back pain can be classified by location, temporal characteristics, pain intensity and pain history.	0.5897147957240341
Currently, for none of these dimensions generally accepted, uniformly employed and validated definitions are available.	0.5483284413037749
In most of the industrialized countries back pain is one of the most expensive symptoms.	0.6862785881620295
75-90 % of the direct and indirect health care costs were caused by those 5-10 % of patients who are disabled.	0.8584168804906979
As predictors of back pain a history of back pain and job satisfaction play by far a more important role than the extensively studied mechanical factors.	0.4761403565156216
For a first episode of back pain the prognosis is favorable.	0.5199615034349936
If the pain persist for more than three months the prognosis is unfavorable.	0.6166625770346644
After six months of absenteeism because of back pain more than half of the afflicted never return to work.	0.4883158302229361
Rarely back pain is present as a single symptom.	0.6275795309989556
In more than 80 % back pain is associated with pain in at least one joint.	0.8214672692658457
It remains to be studied if back pain may be viewed as an entity or as part of a more complex pain syndrome.	0.6010110790938578
Chronic low back pain can be considered to be one of the most frequently treated and most costly diseases in modern industrial societies.	0.6683838405813995
Dysfunctions and imbalances of the spine-supporting muscles increase the risk of low back pain.	0.49302281326663727
Consequently preventive treatment and rehabilitation have to aim at preserving and restoring the full capacity of the spine-supporting muscles as well as training coordination and spine-friendly behaviour.	0.47320027893284117
In addition to various measures of pain therapy, physiotherapeutic treatment including neuro-physiotherapy, physical treatment (eg electrotherapy), balneotherapy and supportive behavioural training, medical rehabilitation therapy (MRT) ranks among the most effective ways of treating low back pain.	0.6007631964333502
MRT applies guidelines and methods of exercise methodology within medically indicated programmes of preventive treatment and rehabilitation.	0.3626283069152699
Various objectives of MRT are outlined with special regard to the stages of MRT treatment, emphasizing positive adaptation of the neuro-muscular system in the course of rehabilitation.	0.4714944745713932
Physicians are responsible for MRT diagnosis and control.	0.33516690733472615
Taking into account the base disorder and the progress of therapy physiotherapists and the physicians in charge determine MRT objectives and treatment strategies.	0.5397633825594613

IgE demonstrated an IgE-mediated sensibilization to sunflower seeds.	0.280049203683136
When sunflower seeds were eaten alone, only discrete paresthesias of the oral mucosa occurred.	0.575175306772991
Surprisingly, an oral challenge with ASA was well tolerated.	0.55537705000731
The supplementary centribution of ASA to the allergic reaction was done-dependent.	0.3524821202858318
The quantity of the allergen also modified the intensity of the symptoms.	0.4569170223724536
This surprising effect of ASA may be attributed to increased gastric resorption of the allergens.	0.3946919219960803
During the course of this reaction, eosinophil-cationic-protein was released.	0.36515424103335264

Periprosthetic femoral fractures present the problem of fracture treatment and prosthetic stability.	0.5088167771853366
Various treatment options are recommended for managing these fractures.	0.4662882234983269
We treated 51 patients with 54 periprosthetic fractures between 1985 and 1995.	0.35550511079314756
Of these, 42 (78 %) fractures were treated with a plate, eight (14 %), with a revision prosthesis, two (4 %), with retrograde nailing, and two (4 %), conservatively due to poor medical condition.	0.8091328083962488
The choice of fracture management was dependent on the type and location of the fracture and on the stability of the prosthesis.	0.837167829338315
A total of 50 fractures healed primarily.	0.45505532873937066
Complications included three cases of plate loosening, one further fracture, one deep infection, one broken bolt and one varus deformity.	0.6310022600735524

Motion analysis of the cervical spine is a sensitive tool in the fields of preventive and clinical biomechanics of whiplash.	0.6433756397569407
In the field of preventive biomechanics motion analysis contributes to validation and optimisation of dummy based crash test experiments and simulations.	0.34357342036877453
In the clinical field motion analysis up to now is of restricted value.	0.6432649556274805
Data exist about restrictions and pathologies of movement and motion of the cervical spine, coordinative disturbances, postural control, TMJ-function and oculomotor disturbances after whiplash.	0.4379632311992159
The standardisation of technical and clinical set-ups is necessary to establish a well proven biomechnical model of whiplash and whiplash related biomechanical dysfunction.	0.5193112855983675
Without this model the value of motion analysis for clinical use will be restricted due to lack of comparable data on sensitivity and specificity although motion analysis of the cervical spine is neither cost- nor time consuming and free of adverse effects.	0.5972946771009938
Within a prospective series of 28 patients (14 m/ 14 f) with a follow-up to six weeks we were lucky to describe numerically two different types of reaction to low energy (v < 20 km/h) rear end collision: Type I with disturbances in complex movements only, Type II with overall restriction of movement.	0.6943705367051505
Control of angular velocity during cyclic movements of the head was disturbed by oscillations of higher frequency in all patients.	0.5508126993665003

Diagnosis of parasomnias in the sleep laboratory is difficult since the nocturnal behavior reported by the patients often does not show up in the laboratory.	0.5761904639814411
To test the efficacy of sleep deprivation as a tool to provoke somnambulism we investigated ten patients (three women and seven men, mean age 27 +/- 3.4) with somnambulism.	0.7032115025094055
Their standard polysomnographies and videomonitored nocturnal behavior was compared to that of sex- and age-matched controls and to polysomnography and behavior after sleep deprivation.	0.6079987548084244
Patients with parasomnias and controls did not show significant differences in sleep parameters with the exception of longer arousal duration in controls, which was nonsignificant.	0.6803339464418074
In magnetic resonance tomography, patients with parasomnias did not reveal abnormality of the brain that might explain release of nocturnal behavior.	0.7444433178568349
Sleep deprivation led to significantly reduced number of arousals, reduced arousal index, significantly prolonged arousal duration and more stage shifts from all sleep stages (nonsignificant).	0.49867673014027336
Complex behavior during sleep increased under sleep deprivation, whereas sleepwalking did not increase.	0.5297449379776916
The majority of complex behavior during sleep is triggered by stage shifts and not by arousal in the sense of the arousal definition of the American Sleep Disorder Society.	0.5162291614648462
Complex behavior in sleep is stereotypical and nonviolent.	0.27224289405991253
Its complexity seems to depend on the duration and intensity of arousals.	0.5389295193570807
Sleep deprivation can be recommended as an efficacious method of increasing complex behavior in sleep, which is a preliminary stage of sleepwalking.	0.723476687776752
Concerning the underlying pathology it seems to be important to register the quality and duration of stimuli that trigger arousals instead of focusing the number of arousals alone.	0.617367358798965
Introduction: In order to investigate whether operative technique determines the 5-year recurrence and survival rates, we analysed the results obtained by two surgical departments using two different operative techniques.	0.782702446139123
Department A: Removal of the tumour and a number of lymph nodes; department B: En-bloc resection in accordance with the requirements of standardised tumour surgery.	0.5780304518142516
Patients and methods: The surgical results obtained with all patients with colorectal carcinoma operated on between 1984 and 1988 (department A: 152 colon and 53 rectal carcinomas; department B: 124 colon and 177 rectal carcinomas).	0.5674909098066747
Results: The local recurrence rate achieved by department A was signicantly higher (colon carcinoma: department A 25 %; department B 10 %; rectal carcinoma: department A 54 %; department B 16 %).	0.6054951799872483
The 5-year survival rate for colon carcinoma was 65 % in department A, and 66 % in department B, the corresponding figures for rectal carcinoma being 49 % and 72 %, respectively.	0.8507026262408197
Conclusion: The results indicate that carcinoma of the colorectum should be operated on only at an institution that complies with the standards required for surgery of colorectal carcinoma.	0.6415430091888117
Definition of the problem: Ethics consultation is one of the most important ways in which clinical ethicists can support both health-care providers and patients and their relatives in coping with ethical and existential challenges.	0.5604701300232346
The practice of ethics consultation, as performed at the Freiburg University Hospital is described and illustrated by a case report about the problem of treatment termination.	0.7640084107994556
The range of subject matters that come up in ethics consultations is analyzed.	0.3360611864849527

A total of 205 patients suffering from stage I and stage II melanoma were investigated with reference to psychosocial stress, social support and attitude to offers of psychotherapeutic support.	0.5922329310599596
Additional counselling by their dermatologist was considered helpful by 59% of the patients, and interviews with a psychotherapist, by 20%.	0.6750972055756087
Patients who where more anxious about a progression of the cancer and thought they had not been given sufficient information about their illness preferred to seek help from the dermatologist.	0.5026380825012616
Patients who appreciated additional counselling by a psychotherapist were usually those with a poorer prognosis for their melanoma and those on whom psychosocial distress weighed especially heavily and who had less social support.	0.4472782912177492

No significant differences were observed between both groups with respect to the following parameters: skin type, minimal erythema dose, single and cumulative doses of UVA1, and peripheral blood eosinophils.	0.729827695876983
However, non-responders were characterized by a highly elevated atopic score, and by high levels of total IgE and of specific IgE.	0.7259086071384571
Furthermore, colonization of the skin with Staphylococcus aureus occured at higher densities, and intestinal growth of Candida albicans was more frequently observed.	0.7061229042010665
These data indicate that high-dose UVA1 irradiation is not effective in all patients suffering from atopic dermatitis.	0.7218843932125468
We conclude that non-responders with complicating infections might benefit from the combination of high-dose UVA1 therapy and antibiotic or antimycotic treatment.	0.5923576787936855
Introduction: Many causes are given as  the main reason for inadequate pain therapy.	0.6005334631942735
The objective of our study was to demonstrate the current position of doctors in general practice all over Austria who prescribe prescriptions.	0.5318194961020472
We report a woman with erythema palmare hereditarium, an anomaly not documented so far in the German literature.	0.6093358717157439
It is characterized by a bright erythema of the palms, usually persistent since birth.	0.528914908262354
It is transmitted in an autosomal-recessive mode and has a benign course.	0.623290081971573
In our patient it was possible to trace the palmar erythema over three generations.	0.5279979258279853
The decline of STD in the region of Rostock, Germany, since 1945 is explained by a decreasing incidence of gonorrhoea and trichomoniasis.	0.49843859265342727
On the other hand chlamydial and candidal infections have increased.	0.48147569969321213
The rate of chlamydia infections was about 45% in our venerological patients, as common as gonorrhea used to be.	0.7186222595345072
Genital candidal infections were to be found in 23%.	0.48985226238624263
Mycoplasmas were identified in 15%, usually combined with other pathogens except in some cases of vaginitis.	0.6734618994803961
The role of radiotherapy in the treatment of Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has changed considerably in the last few decades.	0.692864204080817
Clinical observation of mainly unicentric pathogenesis with continuous expansion and subclinical involvement of adjoining regions of lymph nodes has resulted in the introduction of a large-field technique with total nodal irradiation (TNI) or total lymphatic irradiation (TLI).	0.5749382397489456
The introduction of polychemotherapy has led to further improvement in the cure rate and in considerations concerning using both methods and adapting them to the stage and risk.	0.553847883887428
Today the combination of radiation and chemotherapy leads to a reduction in the amount of radiation required in the affected regions (involved field irradiation = IFI).	0.5592443730302511
The German Society of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery was founded by Martin Waßmund in 1951.	0.35267910161526533
One of the main reasons was the need for scientific representation in the council at a medical convention.	0.6588681348584259
The Society, originally composed of 52 members, was first called "The German Society of Maxillofacial Surgery".	0.6040637285921953
In 1972, it extended its title to include the term "oral" ("Mund") and currently comprises 620 members.	0.701307207185802
A scientific conference is held annually on a specific topic.	0.3148373537830137
The lectures given there have been published since 1954 in "Fortschritte der Kiefer- und Gesichts-Chirurgie" (Progress in Maxillofacial Surgery) by Thieme Verlag; since 1997, they have appeared as a Springer-Verlag supplement.	0.623171357142562
Topics of choice are published in "Mund,- Kiefer- und Gesichtschirurgie" ("Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery"), originally by Hanser in Munich and now by Springer-Verlag in Heidelberg.	0.6579581678773487
In this manner, it was possible to completely document the scientific activities and progress in this specialty.	0.5906001942274461
Each year since 1957, a prize named after M. Waßmund, has been given for outstanding scientific accomplishment.	0.5368539199000238
The presidents, convention locations, topics, and prizewinners are listed in a table.	0.41038180480951447
Since the founding of the Society of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, close cooperation has existed with the National Association of German Oral and Maxillary-Facial Surgeons (Bundesverband der Deutschen Ärzte für Mund-Kiefer-Gesichts-Chirurgie).	0.3949551974138311
In order to intertwine scientific and political interests, a fusion of these two organizations is planned for the year 2000.	0.6217794014560822
The hepatorenal syndrome is defined as the development of renal failure in patients with severe liver disease in the absence of any other identifiable cause of renal functional impairment.	0.7031546860933404
The pathogenesis of this obviously functional renal failure is complex and not completely understood.	0.5035404569137726
Of importance seems to be a peripheral and systemic vasodilatation with redistribution of blood volume.	0.5673920174570336
Nitric oxide seems to play a major role as a possible primary mediator.	0.6626816313392355
As a consequence changes in several different pathophysiological mechanisms (sympathetic nervous system, renin-angiotensin system, vasopressin, endothelin, prostanoids, natriuretic peptides) lead to a functional renal impairment which is characterized by renal cortical vasoconstriction.	0.5214873929760722
Supportive treatment and intensive monitoring of the cardiovascular circulation is the main goal in the care of these patients.	0.839330284682591
The mortality is still high exceeding 90%.	0.4898531284308709
Renal extracorporeal support should be initiated using a continuous method when recovery of liver function is expected (acute liver failure, waiting for liver transplantation).	0.4852940120602936
The only effective and permanent treatment is orthotopic liver transplantation.	0.42671721577620453
A 16 year old patient with the typical clinical signs of Albright's hereditary dystrophia developed series of epileptic seizures with loss of consciousness, tonic muscle contractions and bite of the tongue.	0.6118826350105844
After termination of the seizures there was coma without focal neurological signs.	0.35990736310578747
CT scan revealed diffuse brain edema.	0.28209149811954876
Electroencephalographic studies showed generalized slowing.	0.21295882771440514
In laboratory tests the only abnormalities were marked hypocalcemia (1.15 mmol/l) and hyperphosphatemia.	0.6306256979090437
Blood parathyroid hormone (PTH) was elevated.	0.54174658991991
PTH-Test confirmed the diagnosis of pseudohypoparathyroidism.	0.3999937927417387
The patient was treated with calcium and 1,25-dihydroxy-cholecalciferol.	0.7398001614790619
After few days the severe encephalopathy, CT and electroencephalographic changes were completely reversible.	0.49639408227507875
Hereditary disturbances of the parathyroid hormone metabolism are rare diseases.	0.6182723247724607
Hypocalcemia must be included into the differential diagnosis of seizures and brain edema to avoid invasive diagnostic and irrational treatment.	0.5281905134353515
An adequate increase of uterine blood flow throughout gestation is essential for uterine, placental and fetal growth.	0.4305801314049168
Maternal cardiovascular adaptation has to provide the uterine perfusion that is necessary to meet the requirements of the developing and growing fetus by providing transport of nutrients and oxygen to the placenta and the fetus.	0.583965124521192
Thus uterine blood flow is inextricably linked to fetal growth and survival.	0.3940554111998582
Reductions of uterine blood flow can occur under acute or chronic conditions or in a combination of both.	0.4995884962906707
Chronic reductions of uterine blood flow can be observed in pregnancy induced hyertension (PIH), diabetes mellitus in pregnancy and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).	0.5229308690837579
Chronic restrictions in uterine blood flow will elicit a placental and fetal response in the form of growth adaptation to the reduced supply of oxygen and nutrients to the conceptus.	0.4459970980398867
If compensatory growth restriction reaches its limits intrauterine fetal distress can ensue.	0.26364025333814356
In view of a possible Stent implantation, 20 infrarenal abdominal aneurysms obtained consecutively during postmortem examinations were investigated.	0.5714884820916618
Measurements were performed according to toporegional criteria on the proximal and distal necks of the aneurysms as well as on their lengths and diameters.	0.5353993518970682
Then we correlated the extent of the proximal and distal necks to the aneurysmal lengths and diameters, respectively.	0.5589489933257911
The following results were obtained: 1.	0.6039885707048057
Depending on the increase in length of the infrarenal abdominal aneurysm, there is an inproportional shortening of the proximal and distal neck.	0.7996250318084024
Up to an aneurysmal length of 4 cm both proximal and distant necks are suitable for stent fixation in all cases.	0.4959533728368289
With lengths of more than 4 cm according to the morphological results, the distal neck is almost always unsuitable for fixation of a simple Tube-Stent.	0.5803291834328661
The proximal neck is suitable for stent fixation in all cases up to an aneurysmal length of 10 cm.	0.5355989699706378
For longer aneurysms, only a quarter of all cases is suitable for stent implantation.	0.8006059152738648
In all cases investigated there were severe arteriosclerotic changes with atheromatous ulcerations and secondary wall-adherent thrombi of up to three centimeter thickness in the aneurysmal and para-aneurysmal regions.	0.48000483729977395
These findings have to be considered, with respect to the transluminal transport of the prosthesis as well as in the regions of the supposed implantation in the proximal and distal necks of the aneurysm with individually variable arteriosclerotic changes of the aorta.	0.8295405537576468
We report on a case of paraganglioma of the cauda equina in a 48-year-old man.	0.5957494021371178
These slow-growing, mostly benign and encapsulated intradural-extramedullar tumours are clinically characterized by lumbago, paraesthesia and motor deficits as well as occasi-onally by incontinence.	0.3980592259232154
Paragangliomas of the cauda equina show monomorphous (main) cells arranged in a typical cell cluster pattern, demonstrating a lobular architecture and a fine net of connective tissue formed by so-called sustentacular cells; some tumours show focal ganglionic differentiation.	0.42136136537775065
Because of their morphological similarity to the more common ependymomas, paragangliomas of the cauda equina are sometimes misdiagnosed so that their incidence is likely to be higher than previously estimated.	0.5128113782218986
Immunohistochemistry findings are positive for neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin and other neuronal markers as well as neuropeptides (main cells) and S-100 protein (sustentacular cells) while widely lacking reactivity for GFAP.	0.5615258082371594
Paragangliomas of the cauda equina represent a rare entity, of which only 80 cases have been described in the literature.	0.6803351975404661
Because they only occur sporadically, they are often not included in the differential diagnosis of mass lesions of the region of the cauda equina.	0.647439134280958
Approximately one out of every three patients with carcinoma of the cervix must be expected to experience a recurrence.	0.6628204319653329
The treatment of such relapses is dependent on the site and extension of the recurrence, the type of primary therapy administered and the patient's general condition.	0.8145098535174378
The limit conditions for the application of the established forms of therapy available - surgical operation, radiotherapy, chemotherapy - are complex and seldom documented by randomized studies.	0.7631008034216603
In general, empiric observations and historical analyses determine the backdrop against which therapy is planned.	0.3258225439165912
The main experiences available are compiled in this paper to give a basis for individual treatment of patients with recurrences.	0.680032649786605
Post-traumatic pyogenic liver abscess is a rare disease.	0.7011079589538909
We present the case of a 38-year-old man with multilocular liver abscess and pleural empyema following blunt abdominal trauma.	0.5690315993845775
The patient had a prodrome lasting 3 months before presenting in our department.	0.5240965605731712
The therapy included partial hepatectomy and pleural drainage.	0.24833831299572692
Clinical signs, diagnosis and possible therapy are discussed in this case report.	0.9228339793588191
The dream of every hospital computer scientist is a completely computerized flow of information in his/her facility: admission, diagnosis, treatment, transfer, and discharge of patients.	0.5587906611610333
However, in developing such general hospital information systems, one runs into the following problems: (1) medical and administrative information systems form a very heterogeneous environment; (2) the structure of medical information is extremely complex, except for certain limited administrative data (admission, transfer, and discharge, for example) needed by the clinic administration.	0.7070738744220554
As a result it is nearly impossible to transfer medical information from one system to another without a loss of data.	0.5547943613927543
One cannot expect a universal solution to this problem within the next few years.	0.4249681861169179
Therefore we present a concept which, based on existing tools, allows communication between medical information systems.	0.5467155591560859
Shave excision of nevi is a technique still under debate.	0.3025575640404628
Speed, simplicity, and the fact that it provides excised material for histologic examination are contrasted with the lack of excision margins and a higher rate of nevus recurrences.	0.6364671698982924
In this study, the pros and cons of shave excision were evaluated.	0.4760549872095955
The congenital dyserythropoietic anemias represent a group of rare inborn errors with ineffective erythropoiesis as the predominant mechanism of anemia.	0.3723374529488441
They are primarily classified into three types on the basis of characteristic abnormalities of the erythroblasts as shown by light and electron microscopy.	0.507325611925724
There are distinct associated features such as pattern of heredity, cell kinetics and abnormalities of the cell membrane.	0.5211201810195922
In addition, patients with apparent CDA of heterogenous phenotype are observed, that cannot be attributed to any of the three types.	0.7073935732579695
Recently variant genes have been localized to different regions on chromosome 15 or 22.	0.34231958230862686

Gallstones are a frequent complication and are observed in childhood or adolescence.	0.5374507557917881
Therapeutic measures such as splenectomy, treatment by Interferon  or allogeneic bome marrow transplantation depend on the type and the severity of clinical expression, which shows large variations both within and between affected kindreds.	0.6245754902117289
Sarcopenia is a constant in aging.	0.26047085002318726
Observed over long periods, it can reach 1% per year.	0.7000095322548227
But it is such a tenuous phenomenon that it cannot be observed over short periods at steady state.	0.4171470484712197
The aging phenomenon mainly hits fibers, Type II but on aged muscle thin, normal, and hypertrophic fibers cohabit with sclerosis and fat increases.	0.5249004336672644
Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is characterised by stage-dependent microangiopathy.	0.6382904181732202
With increasing severity there is a decrease in the number of skin capillaries and the oxygen partial pressure.	0.5743383697359444
The cutaneous vascular reserve, which is measured by laser-doppler fluxmetry, is reduced.	0.7474707477571152
Cutaneous microangiopathy is one of the main causes of the trophic disturbances associated with CVI.	0.52015906064981
Low frequency pulsed current improves cutaneous microcirculation and thus nutrition as well as accelerating the formation of granulation tissue.	0.39095659053234877
In a open prospective pilot study, 15 patients suffering from CVI with persistent leg ulcers were treated with low frequency pulsed current (Dermapulse), which is thought to improve particularly the tissue microcirculation.	0.650975600378082
The average age of the patients was 70.3 years and the average duration of ulceration was 79.1 months.	0.9055865280134717
The patients were treated over a period of 38 days.	0.7677919401403902
With this treatmen, 2 ulcers healed completely and 13 showed a reduction of size of on average 63%.	0.5143235116640945
Capillary density increased by 43.5%, while transcutaneous oxygen partial pressure increased by 82.4%.	0.5200689063976006

From 1986 to 1996, we implanted a total of 92 hip arthroplasties (86 cementless, 4 hybrid and 2 cemented) in 65 patients with rheumatoid arthritis.	0.5904845673535817
Of the 89 uncemented cups, 59 were threaded cups (Hofer-Imhof n = 45, Zweymüller n = 7, Mecring n = 5, PM n = 2) and 30 were hemispherical cups of the Harris Galante type I and II.	0.5300007442125514
87 stems were implanted without cement (Zweymüller SL n = 58, Uni n = 16, Schenker n = 9, Zweymüller I n = 4) and 5 with cement.	0.553349979339099
One patient died postoperatively and three (4 implants) within the first year.	0.9386199025941657
To date, one cup of each threaded type had to be revised because of loosening (revision rate approx.	0.49775194988697125

Two threaded cups showed slight migration after cancellous bone grafting in the presence of acetabular protrusion that was present in a total of 13 hip joints.	0.4894617763052211
This subsided markedly after filling with cancellous bone and recentering of the hip joint.	0.41388657743089385
Homogeneous incorporation of the bone grafting und thus remodelling of the medial wall was achieved, with the bone graft exhibiting marked reduction.	0.7875869375805581
At final follow-up, approx.	0.3111182255688767
75 % of the cementless cups had complete bone ingrowth without any evidence of radiolucency (type I), approx.	0.5297304411097223

Abstract   The 5th edition of the TNM classification entails a number of changes concerning head and neck tumors.	0.5824055717024471
The division of stage IV tumors into three subcategories marks a significant expansion of the stage grouping procedure.	0.38507743043589343
Methods: In a retrospective study the clinical course of 3247 patients with head and neck carcinomas were comparatively evaluated according to the 4th and 5th editions of the new TNM classification.	0.6992685404157878
In particular it was the aim of the study to test the prognostic relevance of the subdivision of stage IV especially in mucosal cancer.	0.6429494661720234
Results: In classifying the primary tumor the most extensive changes were noted for supraglottic and salivary gland tumors.	0.6115202976989006
On the basis of the 4th edition of the TNM classification the following recurrence-free 5-year survival rates for 3033 cases of mucosal cancer were calculated: stage I 91,0%, stage II 78,6%, stage III 61,4%, stage IV 31,0%.	0.5853746881627608
The calculations based on the 5th edition yielded: stage I 91,0%, stage II 77,2%, stage III 61,2%, stage IVA 32,4%, stage IVB 25,3%, stage IVC 3,6%.	0.611007582746338
Conclusions: The adequacy of the revised stage classification in establishing a prognostic hierarchy was confirmed.	0.42387346642722146
However, a significant prognostic distinction between N2- (stage IVA) and N3-metastasis (stage IVB) could not be found.	0.9224504936417944
The microcirculation is the organ that provides the direct link between blood and tissue, and thereby between the whole organism and the single cell.	0.6625248108700507
Modern microcirculation research in experimental surgery is characterized by the use of high-resolution video fluorescence microscopy and quantitative computer-assisted image analysis coupled with the techniques of molecular biology and transgenic or knock-out gene technology.	0.5327864774852269
These advances should improve knowledge about surgically relevant physiologic and pathophysiologic phenomena at the interface between blood and tissues and help us to understand the initial molecular mechanisms leading to organ dysfunction following inflammation, ischemia-reperfusion, and transplantation.	0.5114571671094826
Legal and moral considerations hinder the introduction of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in Germany.	0.5704617334612921
This article presents and discusses the ethical arguments for and against PGD.	0.5030409749816873
In the autor's view neither the fact that PGD is not a well established technique nor the danger that single-cell-analysis may lead to misdiagnosis convincingly demonstrates that PGD is morally inacceptable.	0.5839954584959645
Inconsistencies in ethical positions which defend abortions but do not accept PGD are highlighted.	0.25784067154930695
The use of arguments dealing with the prediction of negative social consequences after establishing PGD is criticised.	0.41533037711865733
Extensive counselling prior to PGD should be implemented in order to help couples which want to use the new technique to make an autonomous decision.	0.5222568799606087
The SOFA score, a new system for patients with sepsis-related diseases, was introduced in 1994 by the "Working Group on Sepsis-Related Problems of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine."	0.7966216417780708
The purpose of this study was to compare the new SOFA score with the APACHE II and MOD scores.	0.5034116350143705
The data on 874 patients from a surgical intensive care unit in an university hospital were analyzed using commercially available software (SPSS for Windows, Version 7.5.2 and MS Excel '97).	0.6230772774406456
To compare the different scores, receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) - analyses were applied.	0.5999093383352148
The study demonstrated a clear correlation between an elevated SOFA score and the mortality of the patients during their ICU stay (score 0 -> mortality 0 %, 1 -> 3.6 %, 2 -> 22.5 %, 3 -> 86,7 %, respectively r = 0.445; P = 0,01).	0.8578865520044074
The ROC analyses of the APACHE II, the MOD and the SOFA scores were comparable (area under the curve: APACHE II 0.73, MOD 0.77, SOFA 0.71).	0.46406053184143903
In conclusion, the SOFA score is reliable and might be useful in the daily routine of an intensive care unit.	0.6504448595839202
In individual patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), established prognostic factors do not satisfactorily predict clinical outcome.	0.4256810884521826
For the first time we investigated a total of 100 HNSCC by Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) to define chromosomal alterations that are associated with the patients prognosis.	0.6891369332196216
Patients were followed for at latest 4 but at least 2 years after surgery or until death.	0.7363669944113547
During this observation period twenty-nine of them died because of cancer disease.	0.6145780658749914
The Kaplan-Meier method was used plotting survival curves for every single chromosomal alteration as well as every clinico-pathological parameter.	0.40625428741007424
The curves were tested for significance by the log rank as well as the Breslow test.	0.4762721999087931
Significance of particular prognostic parameters was then evaluated by the Cox regression model.	0.43425076002910246
The overall survival time as well as the recurrence free survival time were significantly lower in patients who's tumors showed amplifications of the chromosomal region 11q13 (p=0.0008 for LR and p=0.0024 for B).	0.5409673495529695
The survival time of the patients was also lower if the carcinomas carried overrepresentations of chromosome 3q (p=0.0299 for LR and p=0.0546 for B).	0.5285647754373796
Multivariate analysis (Cox's proportional hazards model) revealed both alterations as most important independent prognostic factors in HNSCC.	0.5217290972343204
None of the conventional clinico-pathological parameters (pT-, pN-status, UICC stage, grading) achieved statistical significance in the multivariate model.	0.5655967795051524
These results suggest that in HNSCC the occurence of 11q13 amplification and 3q overrepresentation are highly significant independent prognostic markers and of better value than the established TNM and grading criteria.	0.43572289147665594
We report a coincidence of balloon cell melanoma and balloon cell transformation in a dermal nevus of a 56 years old female patient.	0.6369518078721964
The foamy cells in both tumors with different dignity expressed S-100 and Vimentin.	0.48095322797405904
HMB45 was expressed in all balloon cells of the melanoma.	0.4957316411253814
Detection of HMB45 in some of the nevus-associated balloon cells was considered as an expression of cellular activation.	0.5206945001654504
We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of a malignant, primary plaque-type blue naevus in a 61-year-old male.	0.8116304729059782
Two biopsy specimens had been examined within 13 years, and revealed a common and cellular blue variant as a precursor.	0.5879134197325476
Locally invasive growth and regional lymph node swelling were present, but these alone could not confirm malignancy before evaluation of all clinical and histopathological features, as they are known to occur with benign cellular blue naevi.	0.7295156034992047
The recent literature and our case indicate that there is a malignant potential in every histological and clinical variant of blue naevus.	0.6105921948626895
It is difficult to provide valid data with regard to changes in incidence and prevalence of acute pancreatitis in Germany.	0.5196923194815722
The lack of information is due to strict legal regulations to protect personal data, a certain lack of interest in epidemiological research and the lack of exact statistics of diseases treated in hospitals.	0.6004392165805381
The incidence of acute pancreatitis in other industrialized Western countries is about 10 new cases per year and 100,000 inhabitants.	0.5371896367115001
The increase of alcohol consumption over the last 30 years is associated with an increase of ethanol-induced pancreatitis.	0.7194360618682252
One may speculate that due to improved diagnostic possibilities, such as CT scan, cases where acute pancreatitis is diagnosed at autopsy are rare.	0.49590157270691465
Due to the increase in alcohol consumption it can be assume that the incidence and prevalence of chronic pancreatitis have increased in Germany similar to well-documented data from Denmark.	0.7078250720411163
Since alcohol consumption is slightly decreasing in Germany it is likely that the present incidence of about 10 cases of chronic pancreatitis per 100,000 inhabitants will also decrease.	0.5800204387837613
Process-Experiential (PE) therapy is a neo-humanistic treatment that strives to maintain a creative tension between a client-centered emphasis on a genuine, estecming, empathic relationship and the active, task-focused process-directive style of Gestalt therapie.	0.3072602085907551
This form of treatment is scientifically validated (Grawe 1997).	0.48980134584681967
Its theory of function and dysfunction has been updated via contributions from contemporary psychological theory.	0.19169721930590794
It incorporates a set of key therapeutic tasks, each of which is characterized by specific client marker and resolution state, series of steps clients pass through on their way to resolution, and therapist interventions used to facilitate client progress through those steps.	0.33517586008302563
This second part of the review provides an overview of specific therapeutic tasks.	0.4909328079236464
At last suggestions for practical implementation are discussed, and available outcome data is summarized.	0.4543281002223741
The human arterial blood pressure shows not only exogenic alterations, but also spontaneous fluctuations.	0.6637011664983375
This blood pressure variability has both scientific and clinical relevance.	0.5262359364392563
A well-known phenomenon is the so-called "white coat hyptertension" which may severely affect diagnosis and therapy of essential hypertension.	0.657735360083952
Furthermore, several studies have provided evidence that the degree of end-organ damage in hypertensive patients is closely related to the circardian blood pressure variability.	0.7117703149624437
Therefore, it is tempting to suggest that an optimal antihypertensive treatment should take an improvement of the blood pressure variability into consideration.	0.8025942419500187
The faeces sign is a recently described computed tomography (CT) feature of small-bowel obstruction and is seen as a mottled, faeces-like content within the lumen of the dilated loops above the level of the obstacle.	0.5335098212250051
To evaluate its prevalence, significance, and diagnostic value we retrospectively reviewed 94 consecutive cases of small-intestine obstruction studied with CT in the last 6 years.	0.642436852049437
The faeces sign was recognizable in 7 cases (7.4 %) and was localized within ileal loops in all these subjects.	0.6923677192752479
In 6 of the 7 cases there was a simple and progressive obstruction, while there was a sudden onset with intestinal strangulation in only 1.	0.7082605072419882
The faeces sign is due to the intraluminal stagnation of enteric material and is generally recognizable in subjects with subacute obstruction.	0.47506171124764546
In our experience it is relatively uncommon.	0.4508493807997265
Nevertheless, it seems to be rather specific and may be a valuable accessory feature in the CT study of small-bowel obstruction.	0.8562613622685269
A case report is presented to illustrate the cutaneous manifestations in essential thrombocythaemia.	0.6690267858848885
Knowledge of the related skin lesions may lead to earlier detection of this myeloproliferative disorder.	0.5383751149827367
Treatment may prevent severe haemorrhagic or thrombotic complications.	0.2606076290008174
Erythromelalgia is causally related to thrombocythaemia; prompt relief of painful symptoms after treatment with aspirin is typical.	0.42192367224076605
Surgical treatment of proximal aortic disease traditionally consists of composite replacement of valve and aorta.	0.41710900395554634
Recent reconstructive procedures on the aortic root allow for treatment of aortic dilatation and concomitant aortic valve regurgitation without the associated disadvanteages of mechanical heart valves.	0.4523892971118541
Two psychotic patients developed hyperglycaemia several weeks after starting olanzapine.	0.3013217733264782

Profilometry is a novel procedure allowing precise analysis of skin surface structure.	0.40078516427322014
With the help of a synthetic material a negative image of a defined area of the skin is taken.	0.7566724703294461
During the subsequent analytical procedure the roughness is determined by means of a profilometer.	0.5122708941612611
A commercially available statistics software program is used for statistical analysis of the results.	0.5912952244757482
This procedure was applied to check for to evaluate positive effects of oestrogen creams on the structure of the skin surface on the face.	0.7232250949401969
This article describes the historic roots of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) from the first experiments at 1800 until the introduction into the pharmaceutical market in 1899.	0.5591795796349853
In 1869, Hermann Kolbe enlightened the chemical structure of salicylic acid, which was used at that time as an analgetic and antipyretic drug.	0.48937680169346237
Because of the side effects, for example the irritation of the stomach, analytical chemists and pharmacologists searched for chemical modifications.	0.6299402837099707
In August 1897 Felix Hoffmann (1868-1946) was successful in acetylizing the salicylic acid to acetylsalicyl acid (ASA).	0.44832116635763314
Between 1897 and 1899 Kurt Witthauer (1865-1911) collected clinical data and experiences on the efficiency of ASA as an analgetic and antipyretic drug.	0.34199962471008566
In 1899 ASA was introduced into the pharamaceutical market as Aspirin and became soon one of the most successful drugs of its time.	0.5486674539918047
The indication exceeds analgesia in the mean time and to prophylaxis of myocardial ischaemia or cerebral stroke, among others.	0.6072669118158882
Background: The results of the Cryo-ROP group showed that cryotherapy significantly reduces the rate of adverse morphological and functional outcome of eyes with threshold retinopathy of prematurity.	0.6178818339054911
Structural status and visual acuity of 48 eyes which consecutively underwent cryocoagulation in our hospital between 1990 and 1994 were examined at 2 years corrected gestational age.	0.5191770041567504
Despite wide-spread immunisation programs epidemic influenza continues to cause ten thousands of deaths worldwide, every year, especially in the high risk groups of elderly or immunocompromised persons.	0.5682085198822042
At present, amantadine and rimantadine are the only approved agents available for prophylactic and therapeutic use, yet, the deployment of these substances is problematic: neither of the two drugs is effective against influenza B, their use is accompanied by rapid development of viral resistance, and they show many adverse effects.	0.6754166255687234
In contrast, zanamivir and GS4071/GS4104 are rationally developed influenza-specific neuraminidase inhibitors, proving prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy against influenza A and B, as well in vitro as in animal models, and in experimental human studies.	0.6244655968976163
Zanamivir and GS4071/GS4104 are well tolerated without adverse reactions after topic and oral administration, respectively.	0.36029516794356087
Resistant viral strains have been found in cell culture in the presence of both drugs, but the frequency of resistance emergence during clinical use is unclear.	0.7125678459361724
To date, the biggest recognizable disadvantage of neuraminidase inhibitors and Amantadin/Rimantadin alike is that they need to be given within 30-48 h after onset of symptoms, but seeking medical attention at this stage of infection does not seem to be realistic in medical practice.	0.5651712653192983
As neuraminidase inhibitors up to now could mainly be assessed by experimental data, specifically performed clinical trials will have to prove the positive influence of these drugs on the morbidity, course of infection, and mortality of high risk persons when administered for prophylaxis as well as for therapy.	0.6892011280710053
Background and purpose: Without recanalisation, acute basilar artery (BA) occlusion has a mortality of 90 %, which is reduced to 50 % if recanalisation is achieved.	0.6579386114558408
Fast diagnosis of BA occlusion is necessary in order to start thrombolytic therapy without delay.	0.4108778878864571
We wanted to assess the role of CT angiography (CTA) in the diagnostic evaluation of suspected acute BA occlusion.	0.6875048512844163
25 patients with coronary heart disease (CHD, 62  +/-  9 years) and 18 subjects free from cardiovascular disease (28  +/-  9 years) were tested on a cycle ergometer using a graded incremental test protocol: a) in the common upright position, b) as dynamic stress echocardiography in a semi-supine position.	0.7577811818587801
Whereas no relevant differences could be detected between the two conditions for the healthy subjects concerning heart rate, blood pressure, and rate-pressure product (2 x 3 ANOVA, t-test with -adjustment), the CHD patients showed both significantly higher heart rates as well as a significantly higher rate-pressure product (50 W: 15 300  +/-  2973 mmHg/min vs. 13 822  +/-  3042 mmHg/min; 75 W: 18 028  +/-  3479 mmHg/min vs 16 337  +/-  2619 mmHg/min) on equivalent stages during stress echocardiography if compared to the sitting position.	0.699286275366915
There were no differences for systolic blood pressure in this group; the diastolic values were higher in the sitting position at rest and during 50 W. Lactate concentrations (determined only in the healthy subjects) were significantly higher on all stages during dynamic stress echocardiography.	0.7803323521324028
The workload at the individual anaerobic threshold (IAT) was significantly lower.	0.7364704265400451
A new stoechiometric mixture of 27% dicalcium-phosphate (DCPA) and 73% tetra-calcium-phosphate (TTCP) can be prepared with water intraoperatively to a paste that subsequently sets to a structurally stabile implant composed of hydroxyapatite (HA).	0.4175190120480389
Primary setting time is about 20 min; pH during setting ranges from 6.5 to 8.5.	0.6827865333250202

Compressive strength is about 50 MPa, tensile strength about 8 MPa.	0.32221740425304335
Over a period of about 4 h in physiological milieu, the cement converts to hydroxyapatite.	0.49649506055277
This product is no longer redissolvable  in normal body fluid.	0.46457489501750593
This cement can be used for non-load-bearing applications especially in craniofacial bone surgery.	0.5158049372958022
Cranial defects due to tumour or trauma as well as deficits in the facial skeleton may be reconstructed using this new biomaterial.	0.5195896281012132
In nine of ten patients we used the hydroxyapatite cement successfully for reconstructions in the craniofacial area.	0.4580555065783233
Fluid control of the operation field and implant site is extremely important and sometimes difficult to achieve.	0.5993131684664781
Further applications could be all non-load-bearing augmentations such as filling of blocked paranasal sinuses, of dentoalveolar cysts and defects following dental apectomy or fixation of implanted hearing-aid electrodes.	0.3976456671050241
The perspectives for the hydroxyapatite cement include its application as a carrier for osteogenic protein preparations, especially because of its isothermic reaction and intrinsic osteoconductive characteristics.	0.5031300699786194
We present a non-invasive epilepsy surgery protocol, which includes EEG-video-monitoring, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), interictal positron emission tomography (PET) and ictal single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT).	0.572357222855711
According to this non-invasive protocol 50 of 173 patients with medically intractable focal epilepsy underwent resective surgery.	0.44720662430131847
The localization of the epileptogenic zone was based on the congruence of the localizing results of EEG-video-montoring, MRI, interictal PET and ictal SPECT.	0.5120468766454962
46 (92%) of the patients had temporal and 4 (8%) had extratemporal epilepsies.	0.9045222210199005
78% (n=39) of all patients operated according to our non-invasive protocol were postoperatively completely or almost seizure free.	0.7567463810261996
Extramesiotemporal resections could be carried out without invasive EEG-recording if the epileptogenic zone was not adjacent to the eloquent cortex.	0.3564424349953472
We conclude from our results that in a considerable number of patients with medically intractable particularly temporal focal epilepsies, resective epilepsy surgery can be based on non-invasive EEG-evaluations and the risk of invasive recordings can be avoided.	0.5956683247609598
Necrolytic migratory erythema (NME) is mostly associated with a pancreatic-A-cell-glucagonoma and is considered to be a well-defined cutaneous paraneoplastic syndrome.	0.7533340044220677
We report on a 74-year old female who atypically developed a NME after surgical treatment of a rectal adenocarcinoma.	0.7596264957729256

Hair samples and perspiration collected from long term drug addicts (n = 18) under constant methadone treatment were investigated.	0.4620912291279171
Hair segments representing the individual hair growth of 4 weeks were analyzed for methadone, opiates and cocaine by GC/MS.	0.49238294296250723
The results obtained from the transdermal collection devices confirmed the presence of drug substances in variable amounts on the skin surface, methadone being the main analyte.	0.6189665664809612
The perspiration test period lasted for 4 days.	0.32216261666581303
For six persons illicit drugs similar to those in the corresponding hair samples were found.	0.5061093999149067
Overall, a poor relationship (r = 0,602) was found between the methadone dose under steady state conditions and the methadone level in hair.	0.729545837987076
The results are discussed in the light of pharmacokinetic aspects, drug uptake by perspiration and forensic interpretation.	0.6875500644632194
Bilateral carotid artery dissection is a rare and unusual complication of blunt cervicofacial trauma.	0.5871820262748633

Abdominal compartment syndrome is defined by increased intraabdominal pressure above 20 mmHg with increased pulmonary peak pressure and oliguria.	0.5411088338731382
In primary abdominal compartment syndrome the increased intraabdominal pressure is caused directly by peritonitis, ileus or abdominal and pelvic trauma.	0.4804113916475043
Secondary compartment syndrome is a result of forced closure of the abdominal wall after abdominal surgery.	0.6512434236868574
The effects are decreased cardiac output, pulmonary atelectasis, oliguria to anuria and hepatic as well as intestinal reduction of perfusion.	0.44114971466337577
Effective monitoring is done by standardised measuring of urinary bladder pressure.	0.39650330075814777
Normal values are between 0 and 7 cm H2O, after elective laparotomies 5-12 cm H20.	0.6047826272046963
Above 25 cm H20 they are definitely pathological.	0.28405242441812206
For the prevention and therapy of manifested abdominal compartment syndrome the application of a laparostomy using a resorbable mesh is recommended.	0.6598801982530621
Between 1988 and 1999 we applied a laparostomy to lower the intraabdominal pressure in 377 patients.	0.4282906682647258
In 16 % of the cases it was indicated by primary abdominal compartment syndrome with a bladder pressure of 31  +/-  4 cm H20 preoperatively, which could be lowered to 17  +/-  4 cm H20 by laparostomy.	0.7878875597050575
An early reconstruction of the abdominal wall could be performed in 18 % of the cases.	0.92512961673544
Conclusions: The abdominal compartment syndrome is an often underestimated problem in abdominal surgery involving multiple organ systems.	0.594409589221341
The temporary laparostomy lowering intraabdominal pressure rather than a forced closure of the abdominal wall should be used in all circumstances.	0.646417506565209
In general, assessment of the correct placement of a central venous catheter is performed by fluoroscopy or by postinsertional chest X-ray.	0.5530032945163531
We report a case of intraaortic malposition of a central venous catheter in a 59-year-old male patient that was not detectable in chest films.	0.6090903526766986
Further exploration of this patient revealed a left-sided superior vena cava.	0.4548304009710659

The standard indications, single vessel disease and badly controlled angina, are more and more extended to multivessel disease with and without severe angina, unstable or preinfarction angina, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) itself.	0.5583751927530554
Dilating asymptomatic stenoses of more than 70-80% is a widely used indication, intending prophylaxis of complete occlusion and AMI.	0.6498513754982649
Actually there is no generally accepted guideline for the different new indications, conservative versus invasive treatment schedule.	0.5233764449255864
It is difficult for the patient to get appropriate information before his decision between mechanical procedures and conservative methods; authentic informed consent actually seems to be in a very bad position.	0.6723278397546552
In 1992 the working group called "Arbeitsgemeinschaft leitender kardiologischer Krankenhausärzte (ALKK)" decided to start a registry of all PTCA procedures, in order to gain knowledge about the present status of PTCA in Germany.	0.5724243649914513

Two children developed multiple melanocytic naevi after polychemotherapy administered for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in one and for non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the other.	0.5569120657435674
Induction of naevi does not seem to be related to specific agents used in chemotherapy, but rather to the immunosuppression resulting from multiple-agent chemotherapy.	0.5700183369122874
There are reports in the literature of both intrinsically and iatrogenically immunosuppressed patients who have developed multiple melanocytic naevi.	0.6019477663195155
Many small randomized studies with <beta>-blockers in patients with chronic heart failure have been published in recent years.	0.6683145554630958

The ongoing COMET study compares <beta>1-selective blockers like metoprolol with vasodilatative <beta>-blockers like carvedilol in patients with chronic heart failure.	0.4930885355747407
Large clinical registries demonstrate clinical practicability of <beta>-blocker treatment of patients with chronic heart failure.	0.5877189315351896
All patients with stabel chronic heart failure ought to be treated with <beta>-blockers additional to a basic therapy with ACE inhibitors, diuretics, and digitalis.	0.6558228007500875
The <beta>-blocker therapy regimen is to start with low doses and to increase the dose carefully:"Start low and go slow".	0.49174281735457165
Purpose: Cardiac imaging includes determination of the size and structure of the cardiac chambers, valves, great vessels and the coronary arteries, chamber and valvular function, myocardial perfusion, viability and metabolism.	0.6232267183099695
A 52-year-old patient presenting with severe thoracic pain of more than 30 minutes duration and ST-segment elevation > 1 mV in leads V1-3 was given 100 mg rt-PA. With persisting thoracic pain and ST-segment elevation, coronary angiography was performed 90 minutes after administration of thrombolytic therapy.	0.5840647485657088
Surprisingly, angiography revealed normal coronary arteries in presence of marked hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.	0.4562881457699807
New onset of thoracic pain after four hours led to chest raiograph demonstrating increased mediastinal widening and new pleural effusion as compared to a baseline chest film prior to rt-PA. Spiral computed tomography revealed overt Type B aortic dissection with an intimal flap and communication distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery with signs of a mediastinal hematoma.	0.567997794849635
Immediate cardiac surgery with replacement of the dissected aortic segment was successfully performed.	0.4152559671605502
A literature review revealed 4% of aortic dissection to present with electrocardiographic signs of acute myocardial infarction and 13% to have concomitant coronary artery disease; moreover 34 cases of aortic dissection were misdiagnosed as infarction and subjected to thrombolytic agents with a mortality of 64% underlining the importance of exclusion of dissection prior to thombolytic therapy.	0.641808314582463
Between 1984 and 1996 we performed a Mason gastroplasty for the treatment of morbid obesity: 14 patients (average age 40 (26-48) years, body mass index (BMI) 48 (37-71) kg/m2, excessive body weight 67 (41-116) kg).	0.6343134207308124
Since the end of 1996 we now apply adjustable laparoscopic gastric banding (lab band): 73 patients (average age 39 (22-64) years, BMI 45 (32-69) kg/m2, excessive body weight 66 (41-116) kg).	0.6073187979381166
We compared the early and late results of both methods.	0.6550672001805679
Early results: no relevant morbidity or mortality for neither method.	0.4085374389379058
Late/intermediate results: reoperation rate for both methods 15 %.	0.49117969232183606
After an average of 3.7 years the excessive body weight loss (EWL) for gastroplasty was 54 (22-96) %.	0.8453211622122895
The EWL after lab band for 24 patients after 12 months was 47 (11-127) % and for 8 patients after 18 months 51 (28-139) %.	0.8254042739089795
Since the introduction of the lap band the number of bariatric operations has greatly increased.	0.3948295286578078
Nevertheless, the perioperative complication rate has remained low, and the long-term outcome is similar for both methods.	0.825492461103022
We investigated the relationships between prolactin (PRL) levels and antibody occurrence in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).	0.43750736942186874
No significant association between PRL levels and the majority of the autoantibodies studied (anti-U1 RNP, anti-rRNP, anti-Sm, anti-dsDNA, anti-DNP, auto-LCA, anti-EACA) could be confirmed (P > 0.05), anti-Ro/SSA antibodies being an exception.	0.5259171512473906
Our results showed significantly increased frequencies of these antibodies in the group of female SLE patients with normal PRL levels (< 20 µg/L): anti Ro/SSA in 53% (P < 0.025, 2 = 5.80, RR = 4.0) and anti-Ro/SSA + anti-Ro/La in 60% (P < 0.05, 2 = 4.05) compared with female SLE patients with hyperprolactinemia.	0.6734865216139321
An echinococcal cyst of the heart is a rare cause of acute cardiac tamponade.	0.7102689542418862
We report on a 24 year old male from the Kosovo who was brought in an emergency state from a provincial hospital complaining of severe dyspnea, thoracic pain, dizziness, and a short period of unconsciousness.	0.6925669806913142
Surgical decompression had to be performed urgently, because the pericardium could not be punctuated due to the position of the hydatid cyst.	0.7000280322194982
We report on the case of a 51-year-old female patient who had been suffering from multiple itching nodules for 3 years.	0.7107774282036198
Some of these lesions were classified clinically and histologically as keratoacanthomas (KA), whereas the multiple smaller nodules were found on histological examination to be either early stage KA or lesions of prurigo simplex subacuta.	0.6310066178456726
In two KA, HPV subtype 2 was identified by in situ hybridization.	0.4910047978935907
Treatment with etretinate resulted in remission of the fully developed KA and reduced the occurrence of new ones.	0.4616104847654471
The outbreak of multiple KA in our patient resembled a rare subtype described by Witten and Zak.	0.4276647373138594
Postclinical follow-up for 28 months to date has revealed that the KA arise from the subacute prurigo lesions.	0.5548450313098003
This mode of prurigo-dependent KA development has not previously been reported.	0.36834807776657863
We describe a rare case of a papillary fibroelastoma of the aortic valve occurring simultaneously with a cystic tumor (a so-called mesothelioma) of the atrioventricular nodal region.	0.7660508363135246
At autopsy the tumor was found to prolapse into and occlude the right coronary ostium, leading to an acute, recurring myocardial infarction.	0.6405553789702483
Histological examination of the grossly unremarkable conduction system of the heart revealed a cystic tumor in the region of the atrioventricular node.	0.7505941403541883
To our knowledge, this is the first report of coexistence of these two rare cardiac tumors.	0.6452999561657184

In anaesthesising a 31-year-old paraplegic primigravida with a complete transverse spinal lesion at T4 for an elective caesarean section, no indication of hypertonic cardiovascular dysregulation either intra- or postoperatively was observed after repeated epidural administration of bupivacaine.	0.5624502117542829
Distinct intraoperative spasticity of the abdominal wall muscles was, however, not influenced by the dosages selected.	0.5603703712735663
Repetitive magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive, painless method to induce transient activation in circumscript regions of the human cortex.	0.6102750519509935
In contrast to TMS with single pulses rTMS allows a more effective stimulation of association cortex and temporary interference with the proper functioning of stimulated areas.	0.4565507316094461
Possible applications for examination of the functional anatomy of language lateralisation, memory functions and visual perception are discussed.	0.5391046515940966

An unusual shaped piece of skin was found in the oral cavity of a woman who had been stabbed to death.	0.6511030931277046
Physical examination of the victim's numerous male acquaintances revealed one to have an injury of the same shape on the ventral surface of the left ring finger.	0.6822192315140271
Molecular biological investigations showed that this suspect and the piece of skin exhibited corresponding DNA patterns (frequency 1 : 700 000).	0.40066863904639677
This case underlines the importance of physical examination as a preliminary to further detailed investigation.	0.4330423270171725
Nineteen men with post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence grade II and III (mean follow-up 12.7 months) underwent periurethral injections of collagen.	0.687783069317023
In all, 37 procedures were performed; 58 % of the patients underwent the procedure at least twice.	0.7361058534420325
A mean of 16 ml collagen was injected.	0.46146257188118933
The results were successful directly after injections, leaving all patients continent; however, after 3 months the treatment failed and all patients returned to their incontinence status as seen preoperatively.	0.6449166471308777
No perioperative complications were noted.	0.3321626399981282
Despite the simple and safe nature of this procedure, men with severe postoperative stress incontinence do not benefit from periurethral collagen injections.	0.5064148856850477
After a short review of the literature, some aspects of the psychodynamics and therapy of trichotillomania with an adolescent patient are presented that up to now have not been described in great detail.	0.828245017368517
Against the backdrop of previous fears of being abandoned, the patient feels threatened that while coping with the developmental tasks of sexuality and aggressiveness she will be dropped once again.	0.5342576846450132
This psychodynamically oriented therapy makes it possible for the patient to accept and verbalize the corresponding feelings in a relationship that gives a feeling of security.	0.5724830243241444
Therefore, the symptoms that previously served the purpose of regulating diffuse inner tensions and fears may be abandoned.	0.5410454733762904
According to sonographic criteria, 55 patients underwent surgical treatment with mobilisation in a lower leg plaster or conservative treatment with early mobilisation in heel pad (3 cm) shoes when an acute Achilles tendon rupture (ATR) was diagnosed.	0.6557951207863243
The follow-up period in 51 patients was 2.4 years (operated group = 28 patients, conservative group = 23 patients) with clinical examination and testing of isokinetic muscle strength in knee joint flexion.	0.8282127816339934
After surgical treatment, minor wound infections occurred in 10.6 %.	0.5845999928654897
Reruptures occurred in 13 % of the conservative group.	0.7289911747312439
Following conservative treatment, the rate of stress-related achillodynia was significantly higher (P = 0.019).	0.6213215952641146
In the operated group mean isokinetic muscle strength was 13.7 % lower than in the uninvolved leg and decreased significantly with non-operative treatment to 75.3 % (P = 0.012).	0.6883718373028466
We recommend surgical treatment of acute ATR.	0.6884517720779478
The indications for conservative treatment depend on the extent of the rupture (measured by ultrasound in the equinus position), the desired level of daily activity and the patient's degree of compliance.	0.7335501797174977
"MicroSort" promises to become a reliable method for preselecting the sex of our children.	0.4737090092365474
As so many innovations in the field of assisted reproductive technology, however, sex selection raises difficult moral and legal issues.	0.43363736109242784
In this paper, we focus on the question whether or not sex selection calls for a legal ban.	0.679561909991791
Since it does not seem to imply any serious harm to others, we argue in favour of the legalization of sex selection.	0.5322712205242806
Acute limb ischemia is an emergency which regularly requires operative treatment in departments of general surgery.	0.4764896533068151
In about 70 % of cases there is an embolic reason for acute ischemia.	0.820830330310833
In the majority of cases urgent operative desobliteration is required to guarantee limb salvage.	0.5240277644048876
The introduction of balloon catheters reduced the surgical trauma significantly in cases of long secondary thromboses.	0.5072291515614893
More complex procedures are required in patients with preexisting chronic arterial occlusive disease.	0.5025248489789048
The mortality of these emergency operations is still 10-20 % with a limb salvage rate of 80-90 %.	0.6921581259260791
Infectious complications related to acquired neutropenia have become a major medical issue, often requiring intensive care management.	0.4919885551346274
These infections may be lethal if empirical broad-spectrum treatment is not rapidly started at the first sign of infection (i.e., fever), and this concept is now widely recognized a standard practice.	0.5929136296582966
However, the choice of antibiotics has generated considerable controversy for nearly 25 years.	0.48155374764905606
After reviewing some particularities of infection in neutropenic patients, this paper will discuss the options and present comprehensive algorithm for non-infectious diseases specialist, including recent advances about early IV-oral switch and the selection of low risk patients for outpatient management.	0.6058097456827682
Background: It has been suggested that inflammatory processes play a role in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes (ACS).	0.6456779497599155
C-reactive protein (CRP) is a classic acute phase protein.	0.49462931711614694
It is yet unclear whether, in addition to established markers as troponin T (TnT), determination of CRP in patients admitted for ACS contributes significantly to the diagnosis and prognosis of ACS.Patients and Methods: We investigated 50 patients with ACS (59.4 SD 13.9 years) in the first hour after admission and 4-24h later with respect to TnT (Elecsys, Roche Diagnostics) and CRP (biokit, modified Quantex CRP plus, analytical sensitivity 0.02mg/dL).	0.6793696015989006
Fifty percent of the patients were classified as having unstable angina retrospectively.	0.8985412553729509
All patients were followed in the 6 weeks post discharge regarding death and recurrent ACS.Results: The cumulative event rate at 6 weeks after discharge was 62.5% for patients being CRP and TnT positive compared to 35.3% in TnT positive and CRP negative patients.	0.7163155352619877
In TnT negative patients a positive CRP test predicted 33.3% of events and 28.8% of patients negative for CRP and TnT had events at 42 days post discharge.	0.6411083172473017
Logistic regression analysis regarding the primary endpoint including TnT and CRP (4-24h values), age, gender and diagnosis resulted in independent prediction of ACS or death by TnT (cutoff 0.1µg/L, p=0.048, odds ratio=7.5) and CRP (cutoff 0.862mg/dL, p=0.026, odds ratio=5.3).	0.4967445717419904
Sensitivity/specificity for AMI diagnosis were 69.6%/75% for TnT and 12%/72% for CRP in the first hour and 91.3%/68.2% for TnT and 68%/72% for CRP 4-24h later.Conclusions: Besides TnT, high sensitivity CRP determination has no additional value for early AMI diagnosis.	0.748366540520993
The prognosis of these patients during the first 24 hours is significantly and independently predicted by CRP measurements in addition to troponin T.	0.7826610618534482
Purpose: Evaluation of clinical and morphological results in 44 consecutive patients with 45 aneurysms of the posterior circulation.	0.7094011762459072
Following coronary artery bypass grafting repeat ischemia mandatory for reintervention occurs in 2 to 30% of cases, depending mainly on graft age.	0.6421392363707432
Selection of a suitable strategy for revascularisation - transcatheter angioplasty or reoperation - depends on various parameters including coronary morphology, left ventricular performance, comorbidity and availability of graft material.	0.5949607018768384
Catheterbased interventions on saphenous vein bypass grafts are feasible, but lower primary success rates and a higher incidence of restenosis - compared with native coronary arteries - have to be expected.	0.7072893317127251
Repeat coronary artery bypass graft operations are associated with a significantly higher perioperative morbidity and mortality, patency rates are lower and late clinical outcome is worse than in primary surgery.	0.6061900299899662
We report on a patient who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting 4 years ago revealing a high grade ostial stenosis in a jump-graft supplying RCA, LAD and Cx sequentially, making reintervention necessary.	0.5598811103067083
As a prerequisite serial balloon angioplasty of two native vessels was performed prior to ostial intervention.	0.4029797207880119
Intravascular-ultrasound guided directional coronary atherectomy was performed with good primary and long-term result.	0.5788753816107816
Our case demonstrates that, if all relevant clinical parameters and different therapeutic options are taken into account, complex transcatheter angioplasty procedures are feasible and associated with a reasonable amount of risk, thus avoiding repeat coronary artery bypass graft operations.	0.721139220205534
In recent years the indication for a mastectomy for breast cancer has been increasingly restricted.	0.623242558186357
The use of plastic reconstructive techniques enhances the rate of breast-conserving therapy even for large breast tumors with excellent cosmetic results and oncological safety.	0.4804385485637634
The breast-to-tumor ratio and locally complete resection with free tumor margins of 1-2 cm are the most important factors in breast-conserving surgery.	0.7066653272568272
Different techniques of reduction mammoplasty within the concept of oncological breast surgery not only allow large tumors in large breasts to be resected, but also relatively large tumors in normal sized or even smaller breasts to be resected.	0.614950925451319
Other advantages are the reduction of breast size and therefore target volume before postoperative radiation procedures as well as in cancer prophylaxis and risk reduction by reducing ipsi- and contralateral breast tissue.	0.5821284163787989
Reduction mammoplasty techniques with different resection areas have to be selected for individual tumor locations.	0.4922122820042283
The best symmetry is achieved by bilateral mammoplasty in a one step procedure with lumpectomy and axillary dissection.	0.422751432783087
Oncoplastic or reconstructive surgery in the target breast is often followed by procedures to improve symmetry by contralateral reduction.	0.5115908740787963
Whenever possible, mammoplasty techniques with minimal scarring should be chosen out of a variety of reduction procedures.	0.46173041195779635
Epidermoid cysts are rare, benign tumors of the testis or, less frequently, the inguinal cord.	0.6804053138817069
Generally, they affect males between 10 and 39 years.	0.5043061818188007
In newborns they are rare.	0.3443373176091073
We report on a newborn with an epidermoid cyst of the right testis that had been diagnosed in utero and was removed with preservation of the testicle.	0.6774355461014245
Although there are various published descriptions of the dura mater spinalis [4, 7, 9, 11, 16], some points relating to the texture of the collagen fibres in the dura have still not been adequately explained.	0.6602100673884245
In this study the orientation of the collagen fibril bundles was revealed with the aid of scanning electron microscopy, and our observations have yielded new insights into the three-dimensional structure of the human dura mater spinalis.	0.6839103144769717
Reconstructive plastic surgery is not always possible or advisable for nasal defects following tumor resections.	0.5285753663065857
Facial prostheses offer an alternative therapy.	0.3624191574996658
Since 1991, 37 patients with nasal defects after tumor surgery were treated in the Berlin Center of Facial Prostheses: 28 received "soft" silicone facial prostheses and 9 "solid" polymethylmetacrylate facial prostheses.	0.5863370121673559
In 35 patients protheses were bone-anchored: Brånemark implants were used in 12 patients and an Epitec frame construction in 23 patients.	0.5896217183465303
Glue-on prostheses were applied to only two patients.	0.4311607633115308
No intraoperative complications occurred at implant insertion.	0.288297342686288
During following visits only minor inflammations were observed around implants and were treated locally.	0.35449126379589335
The implant success rate was 78% for the Brånemark implants (89.7% in non- radiated areas and 50% in radiated areas) and 100% in radiated and non-radiated areas for the Epitec system.	0.8505222638780894
Our investigation shows that given the right indication, the bone-anchored facial prosthesis is safe, cosmetically acceptable, uncomplicated and not stressful for the patient.	0.5591096078879779
We report a patient who developed malignant transformation of a cellular blue nevus.	0.6715897171549413
At the age of 19 years the congenital, pigmented tumor on the left buttock was histopathologically diagnosed as cellular blue nevus.	0.5206805975144856
Thirty years later the tumor dramatically increased in size, involving the entire left buttock within several months.	0.49219435786471255
Multiple biopsies revealed the presence of a cellular blue nevus within the papillary dermis and an invasive, pleomorphic pigmented sarcoma in the depth of the tissue spreading into subcutis and skeletal muscle.	0.49242568392224634
Both benign and malignant cells were S100+, vimentin+ and HMB-45+, but only the malignant tumor cells stained positive for the proliferating cell nuclear antigen.	0.5695929472883079
General examination disclosed multiple metastases in the paraaortal lymph nodes and the retroperitoneum as well as a single brain metastasis.	0.6091484171509616
Despite palliative therapy with ionizing radiation and chemotherapy, the patient developed generalized metastases and died within weeks.	0.7691786656401044
This case clearly confirms that cellular blue nevi have the potential for malignant transformation and that the malignant variant may behave aggressively just as a malignant melanoma.	0.612843804989079
(Acitve alert) Hypnosis and sports in the psychotherapy of out-patients with anxiety disorders.	0.36003745857050634
A process-oriented approach combining hypnotherapeutic with cognitive-behavioral concepts within a systemic model of psychotherapy for the outpatient treatment of anxiety disorders is outlined.	0.5073696961389105
The use of active alert hypnosis (hypnosis by bicycle ergometry) combining elements of hypnotherapy and sports therapy is adapted to patients characteristics and the process of therapy.	0.47258214012730293
Relaxation and active alert hypnosis and different sports are used as methods of cue exposure respectively training of competence.	0.42919708697927533
The treatment is sequentially structured (motivation, symptom-control, conflict, integration).	0.4666191194239269
Active alert hypnosis catalyses the therapeutic process within the stage of symptom-control (reduction of anxiety and depression) and of conflict (modifcation of intrapsychic conficts or traumata within trance induced by physical exercises).	0.5596510848702719
Therapeutic goals and techniques for each stage are specified by case examples.	0.3278333090040537
Endoscopic techniques in the spine have become possible with improvements in instrumentation.	0.5140474179043985
Other minimally invasive techniques are limited to intradiscal surgery, not at the site of the pathology.	0.6623080787290906
With the transforaminal approach, treatment in the epidural space has become possible.	0.6879030133050859
In a pilot study we investigated the pitfalls, risks, and complications of transforaminal surgery.	0.6253839178439993

Some 27 patients with disk pathologies at the level of the disk space, excluding extremely medially situated herniations, were treated.	0.5750878679255139
We used a standard posterolateral approach under local anesthesia combined with spinal morphine anesthesia.	0.4510461456792697
The treated levels were L5/S1 (11), L4/5 (12), L3/4 (3), and L2/3 (1).	0.6823016402267505
All areas could be reached by this approach.	0.37377741536411796
One procedure had to be abandoned because of instrumentation problems.	0.37057639509892887
One patient had recurrent disk herniation and had an open procedure.	0.4093079413491562
Two patients were reoperated because of persistent pain.	0.5851386305027725
No signs of reherniation could be found in these cases, but there was swelling of the nerve root and minimal scarring.	0.742949728109925
Minor complications were trancient root paresthesia and headache postoperatively.	0.2933583023751106
Postoperative MRI or CT scans revealed only little scar tissue.	0.3562119437061855

Clinical acceptance of the procedure was excellent and the patients recovered very quickly.	0.7439770858215923
Endoscopic transforaminal surgery has a considerable learning curve, even when surgeons are acquainted with the posterolateral approach and arthroskopic surgery.	0.5420288928429017
However, it offers a good alternative to other minimally invasive procedures and has to be seen as a good alternative to open disk surgery, too.	0.7864069253712532
Quality management in a rescue coordination center (RCC) not only needs an evaluation of quantitative parameters (such as time intervals), but also an examination of the correlation between suspected and real found emergency situations.	0.6478040163943088
For that purpose it is necessary to request feedback informations about kind and severity of the emergency situation from the emergency medical team working at the scene.	0.6387791892232435
The case of a fatal catheter-induced cardiac tamponade in a 81-year-old woman is reported.	0.5919036090079588
Death occurred after a delay of 18 h following placement of a central venous catheter for parenteral feeding.	0.5065188908296075
According to the clinical and histological findings, placement of the catheter caused a primary perforation.	0.843556239446385
Confirmation of proper placement of the catheter tip was not performed.	0.4898817323325444
Despite clinical indications on the forthcoming complication, sufficient emergency treatment was not carried out.	0.4671829011750143
Background: The rapid integration of new technology into ophthalmologic practice, e. g. LASIK (laser in situ keratomileusis), is associated with new complications.	0.5921405537624104
The limitations of the new technology cannot be precisely determined.	0.5292674071994038
During lamellar cuts with microkeratomes intraocular pressure (IOP) elevations occur.	0.32021386824954684
The IOP elevation during the lamellar cut cannot be determined by conventional tonometry.	0.39898047512711754
Due to its superior soft tissue contrast conventional MRI is the imaging method of  choice in the evaluation of ankle joint disorders.	0.5317137533650941
Conventional MR imaging can accurately demonstrate normal or acutely injured ligaments; however, in subacute and chronic injury joint fluid necessary for delineation of injured ligaments is absent and MR arthrography should be performed.	0.45878708559773596
MR arthrography uses the intraarticular injection of contrast material to distend the joint, yielding improved discrimination of intraarticular structures.	0.45339363932735544
This joint distension with MR arthrography is also helpful in the staging of osteochondritis dissecans, since in cases of unstable lesions tracking of contrast material into the interface can be more easily demonstrated.	0.5695667217556942
Finally, high contrast and joint distension by MR arthrography improves the detection of intraarticular loose bodies, which often require surgery.	0.63713408746613
