Although a study produced by the Commission would doubtless be interesting, we do not need another to add to those already available.	0.956677302787483
We do need to obtain, from the Commission and the Council, in other words from each of the governments forming the Union, a clear, positive or negative, political stance. They must indicate whether they are ready to defend, within competent public bodies such as the International Monetary Fund in the first instance, the appropriateness of such a tax within the other instruments needed to stabilise the international monetary system.	0.9889774553386027
As for the argument that this initiative would increase uncertainty, very short-term capital movements are specifically intended to play on uncertainty and to bet on changes between currencies or various short-term financial assets.	0.6373141085402365
This argument is therefore not relevant.	0.5004847807900029
I will not go into the basic issue any further for everyone has their arguments.	0.6249718449444561
However, I would highlight not only paragraph 9 of the motion, but also paragraph 10.	0.936902951738583
We clearly expect a political stance to be taken with a very firm deadline of the preparations for the autumn session of the International Monetary Fund. We therefore demand, if this motion is adopted tomorrow, that the Commission and Council appear before Parliament to tell us what positions they will take on this occasion.	1.0159343668937553
Madam President, my Group is extremely delighted that this debate is taking place today, particularly as we have spared no effort along with Members of other groups to bring this about.	0.9431879134705756
Obviously we all have different approaches which is demonstrated by our debate and the motions for a resolution tabled at the beginning.	0.7452113351995492
Having said this, our Group is pleased about the step forward which the compromise motion represents. This invites the Commission to present a report within six months.	0.9100653603200264
The European Parliament can play its role by taking the initiative, even if it does so timidly, on this subject. However, I agree with the previous speaker that, if paragraph 9 were challenged, this motion would clearly lose its substance.	1.0572979605271884
This debate concerns a vital question which increasing numbers of people are legitimately raising. What are the respective places of people and finance in today' s economy?	0.6848241657947
USD 1 800 billion is the volume of money moved every day in the world' s currency markets. This represents over a quarter of the annual global volume of trade in goods and services.	0.7213780649186825
By putting finance at the helm, this has reinforced the demands of profitability and toughened the operating conditions everywhere.	0.6836375457827089
It has led to a growth in mergers, acquisitions and company restructuring and to gigantic sums being raised with increasing frequency on the financial markets.	0.49601001747036094
Unemployment and pressure on employees worldwide is increasing.	0.3382887166270383
Openings and real growth are being hampered and the sudden influx or withdrawal of speculative capital is threatening the economies of many countries, to the point of collapse, as in Asia, Russia and Brazil.	0.7789150802053255
Faced with this neoliberal globalisation dominated by the financial markets, demand, as our motion recognises, is developing from a different idea of the world in which common law stipulates a duty of solidarity in an increasingly interdependent world.	0.8727824213753549
No one can ignore the challenge to civilisation posed by the lack of nearly one billion jobs and the need to make unprecedented efforts in terms of development and access to information.	0.664957072063586
In this respect, all ideas deserve to be considered, including the Tobin tax which is important, just like other forms of transaction which may be envisaged.	0.8624701171161449
This tax could help to check speculation without penalising the activities of the real economy. It could release new resources for investment in people and, at a time when the UNDP estimates the sum needed to eradicate poverty to be USD 40 billion per year, it could allow access for everyone to drinking water and satisfy health needs.	0.7630774206328481
When the debate on the ability of politics to influence economics goes global, the establishment of this tax could become one of the symbols of the political desire to recapture the democratic areas seized by the international financial operators.	0.7648646119777978
The Commissioner has said that a minimum number of industrialised countries would be needed to achieve this.	0.6732255949712137
I would point out that the European Union is composed of a large number of industrialised countries and, like Mr Désir and several other speakers, I feel that the European Union which we are forming can take the initiative in this respect.	1.0296658647625476
In any case, the European Parliament would be honoured to take up the call of the people to control the world in order to achieve a sense of well-being for everyone.	1.0119224250057792
Madam President, I too am delighted that we are having this debate. I only regret that it has been so long in coming.	1.2107845357165181
We know that each generation has, over the course of time, blindly bought into what could be called a dominant ideology. This is a set of prejudices accepted as such due to a general conformism, but whose dramatic nature can be seen by subsequent generations.	0.7495726203025057
Free trade and the constant worship of globalisation are now the dominant ideology or, rather, the big mistake of our fin de siècle. This ideology is as dangerous as the former ideology of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the corridors of the Kremlin or, before that, the certainty, elevated to the status of a dogma, that the earth was flat.	0.7105602776618564
Our world is now dominated by a single logic or, I could say, a single god of money at work instead of people at work.	0.8421369421013317
With a figure for trade in goods and services of FRF 36 000 billion only being equal to the product of four days' speculation, the financial bubble owes very little to the productive activity of individuals.	0.6328326967943924
It is self-perpetuating in a world of ever higher bids which constantly denies the humanity of man, the rich as much as the poor. Yet it is the latter who, at the end of the day, are excluded from the majority of the world' s decision-making centres for these are monopolised by a tiny minority referred to recently, and very aptly, by Jean-Pierre Chevènement as the globalised élites.	0.838017249002537
It was natural that these élites would exclude any political concerns from their field of manoeuvre, thus protecting themselves from any democratic control and basically managing to be both illegitimate and irresponsible.	0.46991394697854627
However, the people are fighting back, as demonstrated by their reaction during the incredible Seattle Summit. The leaders of the world, headed unfortunately by the European Commission, rushed forward submissively, hoping that their docility at the feet of the master of the world, Mr Clinton, would be enough to ensure them the scraps from the table.	0.7835062233735258
Yet they reckoned without the salutary reaction of the nobodies, both individuals and States. This reaction was more organised than previously, due in France particularly to the magnificent ATTAC network which is fighting with increasing support to limit free trade in general and to establish taxation of international financial transactions in particular.	0.698743247234608
The creation of this taxation, of either the Tobin type or the more realistic type proposed by Professor Lauré, could prove to be politically opportune, at least due to its symbolism rather than its low rate. This is because it would basically mean that politics was regaining a foothold in an area from which it has been excluded by operators whose profits are proportional to the degree of resignation of States.	0.7281742464608396
Madam President, although some of the aims of the Tobin tax are fairly worthy of support, introducing the tax exclusively within the territory of the European Union, as the first area of the world to do so, would sound the death knell for the European currency markets.	0.9654712890687253
If the world' s other important currency trading areas were to be excluded from the Tobin tax, the fact that tax was liable to be paid in Europe would lead to currency dealing moving to those areas.	0.6817962608510668
This has already been made clear a number times in this debate.	0.6663454818338003
It is not enough that all the world' s industrialised countries should be included in the scheme, as then currency trading would move to tax havens outside that group of countries.	0.7761525810262787
There should therefore be a universal application: it is not enough that the G7 countries or the other industrialised countries are involved.	0.8508312447803759
On the other hand, it would be so difficult to bring the scheme into force everywhere in the world at precisely the same time - and personally speaking, I do not believe we can achieve this - that the Tobin tax dream might as well be buried.	0.9926074935357924
Furthermore, although there might be international consensus on the introduction of the scheme, the question would remain regarding how the tax revenue would be distributed.	0.8251804476450261
The world' s currency dealing centres will hardly agree to the tax revenue being used, for example, for a variety of well-meaning, UN-backed purposes throughout the world without a considerable amount of the revenue remaining with them.	0.6660394246560951
With regard to the Tobin tax as a means of preventing future currency crises, it has to be realised that the causes of a currency being overvalued cannot be averted through taxation.	0.7076044929863733
For that reason, as Mr Karas also said, we should give more attention to the policies that lead to a certain currency being overvalued in relation to its actual potential value.	0.9696062232327797
This again would require measures to regulate the exportation and importation of capital; otherwise it would not be possible to focus on policies in this way.	0.6877303924553505
Although it seems a reasonable scheme, the Tobin tax is not without its problems, even if there should be agreement as to its implementation, which I do not believe there will.	0.9838578064234126
It has to be remembered that money at present is first and foremost information, and that the global economy will, in the future, rotate more and more on the basis of information and intellectual capital.	0.919540758412673
For that reason, the uninterrupted flow of assets in massive volumes between the world' s financial centres is not merely speculative activity, which has nothing to do with the real economy.	0.7471524082712444
If this 'feedback' mechanism, which gives users the opportunity to make choices, were hampered by measures such as the Tobin tax, mistaken decisions might be made that turned out to be so costly in terms of the economic consequences that the tax would never be able to make up for it.	0.7528617126462596
Hence, as Mr Karas has stated to his credit, our Group is resolutely opposed to the introduction of the Tobin tax.	0.8884449846647051
Madam President, I speak as someone who is in support of a tax on speculative capital movements across currency borders.	0.8239824675829333
It seems to me blindingly self-evident that some action is necessary.	0.5584813895537034
In the last 30 years, the volume of currency transactions has increased by 83 times: firstly, total global reserves of all central banks barely amounts to one day of foreign exchange trading; secondly, annual global trade in real goods and services equals just three-and-a-half days of foreign exchange markets out of 350, that is, 1% of capital movements are for trade in goods and services and 99% are for speculation.	0.5964708859130144
The size, unpredictability and irrationality of the global foreign exchange markets have made it harder and harder to manage national and regional economies.	0.4907955566007971
Computer-controlled selling programmes turned a random blip into an avalanche, burying jobs, lives and industries across the globe.	0.3414009227490986
The only arguments against it are: firstly, it would impair the efficiency of the foreign exchange market - a little fanciful in light of the financial feeding frenzies we have seen that have destroyed jobs throughout the world, in East Asia, Europe and Latin America.	0.8455880708221526
Mr Chirac has described those who engage in this as the Aids virus of the world economy.	0.6399098870544848
What is necessary is to throw some sand into the wheels of the currency speculators, stockbrokers and option traders.	0.5184480154351244
Of course, this cannot be done in one country; it cannot be done within the single currency area, but it could be done at international level with global cooperation.	1.1255356112021064
Europe, Japan and the US - the euro, the yen and the dollar, would constitute, in my opinion, such a block.	0.9248135639238316
I am disappointed in the EPP.	0.4812210387064163
I thought at least they read the resolutions they were going to vote on.	0.5395243750695514
Yes, I am in favour of such a tax, but it is not what we are going to vote on tomorrow.	1.1360624358419806
What we are going to vote on tomorrow is to ask the Commission to study the matter, to look at what steps and what conditions would be necessary for the introduction of such a tax.	1.0023119031113565
Equally I understand the Commissioner failing to endorse such a tax, but I cannot understand why he failed to have the courage to welcome the opportunity to demonstrate the truth of his position by a study of the issue.	0.8404227361183761
There is nothing so closed as a closed mind.	0.5314774215297626
The tax has the support of 47% of the people in the UK, according to a recent survey by War on Want.	0.7774383311629697
In France it has had enormous resonance, particularly when linked to a demand to use the proceeds to help the Third World out of its debt and poverty.	0.7778947797797489
This issue can no longer be ignored by Parliament, the Council or the Commission.	0.9227575299740678
There is now a weight of public opinion demanding an answer more sophisticated than: "It has not been done before".	0.793492884077783
In the new millennium, with new global problems requiring new global solutions, they need to give good arguments why it cannot be done now, rather than why it has not been done in the past.	0.9496490772734713
Madam President, Commissioner, a compromise resolution on the usefulness of a tax on international financial flows would constitute a first step towards the essential amendment of many international rules.	0.7146213098276504
I have two or three points to make in this respect.	0.8311881145793901
One of the main demands of the demonstrators in Seattle was, rightly, the establishment of this type of tax, and this is not by chance.	1.0003589607665273
The proposal of this tax today sends out a strong signal from the rich European countries proving that they want to move away from the culture of egoism.	0.648984600472132
Everyone feels that this kind of joint tax is a virtuous measure which does not prevent trade but is aimed primarily at speculation and its perverse effects. The Members on the right should note this.	0.6556216195536005
It symbolises the need for solidarity with the countries of the south, particularly those in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific which questioned us extensively on this subject in Seattle.	0.849316710282524
In order to fully achieve its objective, the money supply released by such a tax must be redistributed among the poorest countries.	0.6672876061924877
This is how we can give sense and morality to the commercial rules and show solidarity with the people of the south.	0.8418228415202265
Madam President, we cannot just keep repeating the number which several previous speakers have quoted; we must also mention the fact, Commissioner, that 80% of these huge, daily foreign exchange sales have an investment term of no more than eight days.	0.8470161738353198
We cannot maintain a situation in which investments and the creation of jobs are less lucrative than short-term sales of foreign currency and shares.	0.5092329006517553
We cannot maintain a situation in which we allow ourselves to destroy the opportunity to take political action.	0.6266515412652722
We cannot maintain a situation in which income from non-economic activities increases more and more quickly.	0.48039261721141774
It has been demonstrated in Germany that income from monetary assets has almost doubled from 7.6% of overall economic income since Tobin developed his idea.	0.501205542573701
We cannot maintain a situation in which the poorest countries of the world are most exposed to the speculative arguments surrounding short-term currency fluctuations.	0.711955528090907
Nor do I believe that this is impracticable.	0.8378370120595666
Why should it not be possible for the G7 countries, the other EU Member States, China, Singapore and Switzerland to come to an agreement on the introduction of the Tobin tax?	0.9201605135627264
There must be an overriding economic interest.	0.5454682148868654
Why should it be impracticable, and it can be differentiated, to impose this tax on spot foreign exchange transactions, all the so-called cash transactions, currency futures and options?	0.8798645194485363
Why should it be impracticable to set this tax at a rate which does not jeopardise the long-term investments needed by the economy but which finally makes short-term and speculative investments unattractive.	0.5589960043117334
Numerous very difficult questions are bound to arise, but the only real problem which I can see so far is one of political will and the St. Florian principle of shifting responsibility from one agency to another which has now taken hold.	0.7552166700104128
Madam President, we are not asking for more bureaucracy, as Mr Karas put it just a few minutes ago.	1.123588759345233
We are looking for solutions.	0.4883493978463394
Of course capital markets need clarity - that is actually the idea.	0.7526694932495188
The Tobin tax will bring some transparency to a very obscure question.	0.6492356772669235
"The more progress is made towards trade liberalisation, the more rules are needed", as Commissioner Lamy said during the Millennium Round in Seattle.	0.7682511595226259
He recognised that the combined impact of the single market and the single currency that characterise the process of the European Union's construction is intimately linked to a huge amount of new regulations.	0.7456740995746607
Now that financing is readily available across national boundaries without any difficulty the same approach will obviously be strictly necessary, all the more so as we consider that an enormous amount every single day is employed in speculative transactions.	0.6527079949207905
We citizens of the world cannot afford the current rate of speculation.	0.7539347931384254
To continue would be economic suicide.	0.2702377886790693
Honourable Members, Commissioner, it is often said that Europe has succeeded in stabilising the economic sector, but this is only true if we confine ourselves purely to the public sector.	0.9204019630545917
If we look at the private sector, however, we will find not only that this fabled 'financial stability' has been unsuccessful but that we are most probably sitting on a volcano ready to erupt at any moment.	0.7460337704864667
The debt burdens of the private sector and the corresponding excessive inflation of Stock Exchange securities, the two main market stability indicators, have, for some time, been at danger levels, as the Commission report on the economic situation in Europe clearly illustrates.	0.9913219846823788
The fact that the public accepts such rates and does not just abandon all financial activities in a panic can be explained by overambitious expectations over future gains.	0.5460790645178271
Speculative activities are growing beyond measure and are, in turn, generating profits which will eventually prove to be merely fictitious.	0.5481554190507156
Over-optimism will give way to disappointment and fear, which, in turn, will result in a stock market and economic crisis.	0.7639511076416793
The danger is too great for us to ignore.	0.4389662644855722
We ought to face it regardless of how difficult it may seem.	0.5944954907751049
Modern economic science has provided an exceptional instrument with the Tobin proposal and others, which we will be able to use if we have the political will to make a start.	0.9239319803688087
That is what we are lacking, Commissioner: the political will to make a start in tackling speculation.	1.1159602873233345
No longer should there be a place in democracy for the worship of, or for this fatalist approach towards, market forces as adopted by the liberals - and I am sorry that Mr Gasòliba I Böhm has left - as this will only lead to its ruin.	0.8065333516975672
Madam President, Mr Bolkestein, the ignorance surrounding this debate is unbelievable.	1.0032567600422038
We needed a Greek Member to finally tell us what this Tobin tax means.	0.3791931277286249
You reject it flatly because you do not understand the first thing about it.	0.6165913375895159
That the Right opposes taxes is quite understandable, except that they should never have been allowed to spirit their millions, or rather billions, into Switzerland.	0.7898910803541462
We all know that!	0.4676283629156165
But now I call on you, in all consciousness, to help put a stop to speculative financial transactions and undermining long-term projects with long-term capital.	0.9086569453444011
It has never been done in south-east Asia, it has never been done in Europe, and I can understand why Mr Karas from Austria has left the chamber, given Austria' s financial record.	0.9821692860229304
They are all tarred with the same dirty brush!	0.6301239239105819
We need a Tobin tax to give us a fiscal instrument with which we can intervene.	1.001369440277742
Madam President, I am totally appalled by the Commission' s, i.e. Mr Bolkestein' s, political ignorance!	0.9065768762011784
He should perhaps use his position on the Tobin tax to ask himself why he is here at all!	0.5464347202284239
Madam President, I too have found parts of the debate quite bizarre.	1.0490479592443087
It is perhaps not by chance that the Conservative benches have emptied because that which is represented as market freedom no longer has anything in common with the noble principles of the social market economy which has brought so much prosperity to us here in western Europe over recent decades.	0.5707439388507168
If we continue down this path, and this is the ideology, and declare the financial markets to be sacrosanct and even claim that any intervention in the workings of these markets is contrary to progress and contrary to the growth of the economy, then we will quite certainly be on the wrong tack and that could take on quite dangerous proportions.	0.8285899355673977
Those who own the monetary assets are currently amassing huge fortunes which are again screaming out to be reinvested.	0.39872524110029306
We have asset inflation of global proportions.	0.28329027952170327
As a result, speculative bubbles continually arise on the financial markets, causing growing economic instability which, in turn, jeopardises the entire economy.	0.6061025862374871
And it is precisely the medium-sized undertakings and large numbers of employees who suffer as a result.	0.8112182930973659
We can take action against this; it is possible.	0.9102149142249095
The minimum requirements for this would be for a proper study to be carried out at long last, not only by the Commission, but by reputable economic institutes throughout Europe.	0.8754867402697885
That too is feasible.	0.3397644080269518
And then perhaps everyone will stop bandying about arguments which are asking for trouble!	0.4124716314871726
It is not correct that the Tobin tax is technically impracticable - it is quite feasible in the age of the computer.	0.8675564381235845
The fact that tax havens are frequently nothing but hard disk storage space for large European banks here at home must not be ignored.	0.5093695518234951
In short, we must not allow real capital and speculative capital to become so remote from each other, because otherwise we shall be steering towards situations which we experienced on this continent time and again during the last century and which had catastrophic results.	0.7897843066311927
Madam President, let us indeed tax money speculation: it does not produce anything new.	0.6543525179549313
The tax would be targeted at the right place: at the speculators.	0.6714094110801304
Who is going to defend these speculators, when nurses and teachers are paying top rates of tax?	0.5282323272213106
Article 73 c of the Treaty establishing the European Union provides scope for taxation on transactions.	0.7651457019654998
Those who oppose taxation on currency dealing are in favour of those tax-recycling centres, the tax havens, of which there are 62 in all.	0.7676556906979505
The Union should make a tax pact, which any countries could initially be party to.	0.7244205700896998
The low rate Tobin tax would not cause tax-recycling problems.	0.4761080244067667
It is strange to claim that if everyone is not included it would be impossible to bring into effect.	0.6228009164295527
The European Union was founded through the efforts of just a few countries, and you see how we are today.	1.1183304382621513
The truth is the greatest problem is a political one: they do not want to tax capital, but raise personal taxation instead.	0.825417191645218
In the end tax would politicise the global, undemocratic system of financial power.	0.5749437752902191
Ladies and gentlemen, we must challenge the monopoly the world' s speculative elite have on planning the world' s economy by remaining outside the tax system.	0.578408153758639
Madam President, may I begin by extending a heartfelt thanks to all speakers and, above all of course, Mr Désir, for the fact that this debate is taking place this evening.	0.9208571780592718
Whatever one may think about the topic of debate, it is evident that it is an important one.	0.856577049939635
This is why it has been around for years, and it is satisfying that the Commission is being afforded the opportunity this evening to give a response.	0.9904952200673848
I would like to start by underlining two remarks made by the Member of your Parliament, Mr Gasòliba.	0.8828669311378535
He said that globalisation is a positive phenomenon, and I share his view.	0.9509493060126679
I believe that globalisation has helped many countries which, so far, have been on the sideline of the world trade streams to participate in these and be incorporated into the world trade system and, as far as I am aware, no country has ever been worse off by participating in international trade.	0.907797909598872
In other words, as indeed already remarked by Mr Gasòliba, globalisation is, in my view, positive, and I am of the opinion that it has contributed to a new international distribution of labour which has been pursued by many people for many years.	0.9690071607297547
A second remark made by Mr Gasòliba was that there is currently no evidence that the Tobin tax will stabilise the exchange rates.	0.709937557015072
I think that he is correct in this regard.	0.8940580016613755
I too am not aware of any reason why a tax on exchange rate transactions would lead to a stabilisation of exchange rates.	0.6457609903791073
I am of the opinion that these are two important remarks, and that is why I am reiterating them here.	0.992687171426058
Madam President, could I furthermore point out that none of the speakers this evening has drawn a link between the Tobin tax on the one hand and the functioning of the European Union on the other?	0.899016003914005
Surely we are all familiar with the Treaty of Rome and know that one of the four freedoms is the freedom of capital movement.	0.8586308906317517
Madam President, I can assure your Parliament that my day-to-day work consists partly of attempting, in conjunction with my offices and colleagues, to completely integrate the financial markets within Europe, thus enabling financial transactions to run as easily and smoothly as possible.	0.7873760942650077
In my capacity as Commissioner for the Internal Market, I am, in other words, opposed to all measures which hamper international financial transactions.	0.7507584673009208
You could hardly expect this Commissioner to agree with a tax which would, in fact, impede international economic movement.	0.5745062047798662
Once again, the Tobin tax is, in my view, at odds with the Treaty of Rome, and this is an important, theoretical objection which has not been considered by any of the speakers this evening.	1.0249134205601107
Madam President, apart from these - to my mind - quite fundamental observations, there are also practical objections to the Tobin tax, as already underlined by Mr Karas and other speakers.	0.9313886276221771
It has unfortunately been observed, I have to say, that the European Union has failed to reach agreement internally on specific tax measures. This indicates how difficult these dossiers are.	0.9562894985481482
If we have not been able to reach agreement internally, I wonder whether we will then be able to convince the other trade partners.	0.9877133510818487
I think that this will be problematic.	0.9248747685199794
Madam President, Mr Jonckheer has stated that this could be one of the measures for stabilising the financial markets.	0.9325453220947438
I think, however, that instability is merely a symptom and that we should be looking at the underlying causes. I think that it is preferable to fight the causes rather than attempt to tackle the symptoms when this is probably not possible and when, as already stated, the measure concerned is pretty certainly at odds with the Treaty of Rome.	0.881954267355136
In order to remove these causes, one has to look at what is happening in the countries in question.	1.0600771890493452
Is it the case that these countries can boast of what is termed in English 'good governance' ?	0.6510917809541779
Is it the case that there is low inflation and that there are low interest rates?	0.7219524259644271
That the markets for production factors, including the labour market, operate flexibly?	0.6847518025529935
That is not always the case.	0.7750353339690829
So if we want to look into what causes exchange rate instability, then we need to take into account the elements of good governance and focus on these first.	0.9251400192496816
In addition - and this has also been mentioned already, for example by Mr Gasòliba I Böhm, but also by others - there is a need for more supervision.	1.0910097397434442
More supervision nationally - supervision by national governments of national banks - and internationally, for example by means of the IMF.	0.8856623498083008
So I believe the best way to tackle the causes is by ensuring, on the one hand, that good governance is observed in the countries in question and that, on the other hand, there is more supervision nationally and internationally in order to avoid these lapses.	0.9217282805730478
Madam President, according to various Members of your Parliament, more funding should still be made available for major projects.	0.7144130315346575
For example, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler spoke in English about 'long-term capital for long-term projects' - this is an obvious issue.	0.8457258634885032
My reply to this is that, firstly, countries should honour their pledges, namely make 0.7% of their Gross National Product available for development aid and cooperation, so that a great deal more money becomes available than at present for such long-term projects and via a route established for the purpose, namely contributions to development cooperation, and not via an artificial and probably harmful route, namely the Tobin tax.	0.8281239716458264
Madam President, I should like to leave it here. As far as the resolution is concerned, of which I have seen a draft, the Commission will await the vote and will, based on this, determine its stance.	1.0177417553365116
I thank you for giving me the opportunity to take part in this debate.	0.7163006991298573
I have received four motions for a resolution, tabled pursuant to Rule 40(5) of the Rules of Procedure.	0.7128315394953029
Madam President, unfortunately I do not have your mastery of the French language.	0.9911908688198097
But I would be obliged if Mr Bolkestein would just listen for a minute, which I think he cannot do at the same time as talking to Mrs Randzio-Plath.	0.9089527742493011
Could you please draw his attention to the fact that I have something to say to him?	0.872838759974166
Monsieur Bolkestein, je veux vous dire quelque chose!	0.20690130511966542
Unfortunately, my Dutch is not as good as yours.	0.8094117589207284
But I would rather like to say something else to you.	0.9527166005874531
Parliament is not taking the initiative and supporting a Tobin type tax just to annoy the Commission.	0.6200516078973488
We want to examine the possibility of introducing a Tobin tax.	0.689118814928234
It will be just one of several instruments and hopefully you will be on our side in this.	0.7751306016326255
From a political point of view, I always fret when people say, we neither need, want nor can we achieve these things!	0.8033964217982595
It is not your job, it is our job to decide on that.	0.9430982200697179
It also has something to do with the newly awoken self-consciousness of this Parliament.	0.6486692938819663
I just want to discuss it with you, no more and no less.	0.7391345956083561
We can do so without going off at other tangents. I respect you as a serious Commissioner who wants to take his work seriously.	0.6859028762178306
Please respect us as Members of Parliament who want to take our work seriously, and that includes the Tobin tax!	1.0094362336094693
Madam President, an omission appears to have been made. In the list of tabled motions for a resolution which you have just read out, no mention is made of the compromise motion tabled jointly by the PSE, ELDR, GUE/NGL and Greens/EFA Groups and by Mrs Kuntz and Mr Coûteaux.	0.8983459004408882
Mr Désir, I note your comment and the existence of this joint motion for a resolution.	0.7781441787662287
If the services of the Presidency confirm that this was correctly tabled, it will be included.	0.9382262964715529
The debate is closed.	0.04146649521247962
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.	0.25242215024922016

Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	0.49227983774613004
Mr President, I simply wanted to pass on some news. There was a terrorist attack this morning in Madrid.	0.7681446754468735
Someone planted a car bomb and one person has died.	0.31050377527190415
On behalf of my Group, I once again condemn these terrorist acts.	0.7523624290218974
Thank you, Mrs Fraga Estévez.	0.6913796854682696
We had heard about this regrettable incident.	0.29714060203947124
Unfortunately, the terrorist murderers are once again punishing Spanish society. I note your comments with particular keenness, as you may expect, given that I too am Spanish.	0.8894852523164999
(The Minutes were approved)	0.0864398819752701
Resumption of the session	0.09254918046331684
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 21 January 2000.	0.5726098741660416
Madam President, allow me to remind you that tomorrow will be the second anniversary of the Cermis tragedy.	0.7181506519051173
Two years ago, in Cavalese in Italy, an American aeroplane from the Aviano NATO base cut through the cables of a cable car during a low-flying exercise which exceeded safe limits, causing the deaths of more than 20 Europeans.	0.5757456548147589
Since then, the victims' families, who have not had the consolation of justice, since the pilot responsible has not faced criminal charges, have been awaiting solicitous financial compensation from the United States at the very least.	0.9455382098995608
I therefore appeal to the President of this House and the President of the Commission for them to stand surety for immediate compensation from the U.S. authorities, and this is in order to uphold the rights of the victims' families.	1.006544949630292
Mrs Angelilli, thank you. I have taken note of your comment.	0.863022349851637
Agenda	-0.0
The next item is the order of business.	0.402445221477745
Following a request to this effect, which I have received from a number of political groups, and following the meeting of the Conference of Presidents which has just been held, I propose that we add to the agenda a one and a half hour debate on a topical and urgent subject of major importance, pursuant to Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure, on the subject of the European Union' s reaction with regard to the talks in Austria on forming a government.	0.9232242388360943
If you decide to add this debate to the agenda, it will be introduced by speeches from Mr Seixas da Costa, President-in-Office of the Council, and Mr Romano Prodi, President of the Commission.	0.7973161371005119
Is there anyone who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal?	0.49259663474283355
Madam President, I would like to express my support for the decision of the Conference of Presidents, and, since I publicly criticised the presidency in January, I would like to take this opportunity to say, both for myself and on behalf of the Socialist Group, that we now find the presidency' s statements on this issue to be appropriate, and we agree on their basis, their importance and their form.	0.9499127891163625
Madam President, it would really be very difficult to imagine a debate which is more in accordance with Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure.	0.9364386174368157
This debate is topical, exceptionally important and urgent.	0.5858739617396196
We therefore believe that the agenda should be amended to include it.	0.7764868221663614
(Applause)	-0.0
Is there anyone who wishes to speak against this proposal?	0.429693896737564
Madam President, I shall speak against this proposal on the grounds of a principle which I consider absolutely vital with regard to observance of the Treaties, and with particular regard to Article 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	0.9379669194792692
Madam President, until now we believed that the European Union was, according to the Treaty of Rome and the Treaty of Paris founding the European Communities, and subsequently the Union, an association of free, independent, sovereign states.	0.9575877693163483
Even though many developments cast doubt on this, we did believe, in spite of everything, that this was the case and, more recently, reference was made, albeit half-heartedly, to the principle of subsidiarity.	1.0629548613664432
Well, patently, if we do open this debate today, Madam President, as you are requesting and as the Conference of Presidents is requesting, on the basis of Rule 50, we shall then be opening up a fearsome breach in the principle of the freedom and sovereignty of the national states and the free constitution of democratically elected governments, enabling some other majority in this Parliament, at some future time, to claim the right to interfere in the formation of a government even though it has assumed power on the basis of free, regular, peaceful and democratic elections within a Member State.	0.8803782033329269
If you ratify ...	0.3563312694637508
Mr Gollnisch, excuse me, you have one minute.	0.6697974185043543
I know that you always take particular care to ensure that the Rules of Procedure are observed.	0.7193464239881928
Madam President, I thought I had three minutes.	0.7897541839933926
Do forgive me.	0.07183534393798448
If you ratify this development, then you are ratifying the development of the Union into a body which violates the sovereignty and the freedom of the Member States, and we should then have no option but to withdraw from such a Union.	0.9203736327026967
We have heard one speaker in favour and one against.	0.5110521237554355
I shall now, therefore, put this proposal for an amendment to the agenda to the vote.	0.8306825633806388
(Parliament gave its assent)	0.038249974869252856
This debate is therefore added at the top of the order of business.	0.5331419677378858
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE	0.1455766746044931
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.	0.3717355587323584
Talks in Austria on forming a government	0.08467938958982336
The next item is the debate on the talks in Austria on forming a government.	0.40604884181689205
I shall immediately give the floor to Mr Seixas da Costa, President-in-Office of the Council.	0.46832063901516024
Madam President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, the Group of the Party of European Socialists hopes that this debate will send three messages to the European public.	0.7282932579017424
Let it be noted that we are completely united on all three counts.	0.67291221334401
Firstly, we wish to express our total support for, and our solidarity with, the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the 14 Member States, because we believe that this statement is in accordance with the common values, and not just the political force, which we have all built together.	1.1460158903440179
In any event, these common values are in complete opposition to those held by the party ironically known as the Austrian Freedom Party.	0.6004616948891174
The Europe we are building is born of the bitter experiences we have all suffered, and the Socialist Group condemns the insults which have been directed at the President of the French Republic and the Belgian Government, but also at the Socialists, who are European citizens as well, because, at the moment, the Austrian Socialists are being described as traitors to their country.	0.9116903815084753
I will say one thing. For many years I was a traitor to my country; at least that was General Franco' s view.	0.8469252247582751
President Guterres was also a traitor in Salazar' s eyes, and that is something that I believe should also be stated and defended by the PPE-DE.	0.794225527457958
I also believe that the Commission, or President Prodi, has acted as a guardian of the Treaties.	0.9263509397110862
However, I would remind him that, during his inaugural debate, he described the Commission as a European government.	1.1065416727236155
A government must have more nerve and more courage.	0.45671352529378695
That is what I am asking President Prodi for at this moment.	0.9858860039260511
(Applause)	-0.0
With all due respect to a Commissioner as effective as Mr Fischler, and given that we have heard contradictory comments, depending on the translation, with regard to a possible request by President Prodi for the resignation of Mr Fischler, I would be very grateful if this point could be clarified in this House.	0.9493557116429056
Secondly, Madam President, we wish to send a very clear message to the Austrian people.	0.9285285602534701
This is an appeal to the majority of Austrians who have not voted for Haider, who have voted for the clearly democratic options, committed to Europe, and I must point out that Mr Schüssel may have been Minister for Finance, but Chancellor Vranitzky also contributed to Austria' s integration process.	0.8879514227202815
We should not be so politically partisan.	0.8728304289570586
The accession of Austria to the Community was a joint venture.	0.7889323222686321
We all took part in it, not just one group.	0.765198328741024
Therefore, Madam President, I believe that it is our right and our obligation to ask the Austrians to reconsider and reflect, because this type of menace, which we have suffered before in Europe, may not only harm Austria, but it may also spread, and I say this bearing history in mind.	0.9991857121495689
Therefore, apart from the apology which Mr Schüssel has made, offering us all kinds of guarantees, as did Chamberlain and Daladier in 1938 in Munich, I would like to know whether the PPE intends to implement measures in relation to the Austrian People' s Party, if it goes ahead with this mad project.	0.7507835595162927
Thirdly, if we do not stand up to this unnatural alliance, I can assure you that we can forget the European Union' s main objective - enlargement - because, if we were Czechs, Slovenes or Hungarians, what would we say, faced with a neighbour who judges us on racial grounds and does not want us to enter?	0.8934600236116023
I therefore think that this is a great day for European politics to commence.	0.8253036143396252
We support the Council and we believe that it is our right and our obligation to appeal to the Austrian people to seriously reconsider this completely crazy option.	0.8286364404253787
(Applause from the PSE Group)	0.21280351447521983
Madam President, we could have been debating the need to reinforce the founding principles of the Union, so that we can uphold them together.	0.9821336172504599
Instead, we have been forced to debate the formal, substantial errors that have been made in the last few days.	1.0519672168572989
We are astonished by the political naivety of people who, with thoughtless words, have bolstered Mr Haider' s position in Austria and made the Union look ridiculous, riding roughshod over Article 7 of the Treaty by announcing unconstitutional measures.	0.7624399507995911
We have never before seen such serious, clumsy interference in the internal affairs of a Member State.	0.48521165291907414
Of course, we cannot violate the founding values of Europe, and in this regard, the Italian Prime Minister stated that these principles are included in a treaty: he mentioned the Treaty of Copenhagen, which I, like you, have never heard of because it does not exist.	1.0223070604343538
Maybe he was referring to the Treaty of Amsterdam, Article 6 of which lists certain principles and Article 7 certain procedures, in order to establish that a Member State is seriously and continuously violating the principles referred to in Article 6.	0.7298011383767139
However, up till now, Austria has committed no serious or persistent violation.	0.6042189904637921
Apart from amounting to interference, the statement by the Presidency is discriminatory because it authorises the penalisation of a population and denies these people their right to choose who to vote for.	0.5945638168059991
No political cohesion has so far come about, not even in the fight against organised crime, or in defence of the victims of genocide; we do not have a currency that is even remotely stable or an economy which really does combat unemployment and poverty; but it only took one minute of iconoclastic fury to destroy the Union' s credibility.	0.8047635483710426
Sanctions can be imposed after the Treaties have been violated, but cannot be applied if a democratically elected party enters government.	0.6217523131161947
Otherwise, how will we deal with Communist countries which return to Communism: will we throw them out of the Union too if Communists enter into government, or will Stalin' s grandchildren be forgiven for everything?	0.7545169963123508
(Applause from the right) It is via diplomacy, persuasion, knowledge, and solidarity, and not with threats or via anti-constitutional means that the institutions can ensure respect for themselves and for principles.	0.7834908738208207
Bilateral relations involve the States, so the 14 do not come into this.	0.8180311931424622
This is riding roughshod over the European institutions in order to defend political ways of thinking, with an incompetence worthy of parties which have just emerged from totalitarian regimes. It is not what you would expect of the representatives of democratic traditions.	0.8528899986079135
So many things set us apart from Mr Haider - as we have often written - including his claim to the completely Italian Alto Adige region.	0.7421094072309457
However, we already knew this.	0.9837027413228276
However, today we are concerned to learn that other representatives of the Union seem to have turned their backs on the Union' s democratic role.	0.8667188387287214
We support legality and democracy as expressed by the peoples, and favour upholding national sovereignty as long as this does not violate the principles of the Treaty or human rights.	0.8027862227294017
We believe in Europe, while it seems that others have started the process of breaking up the Union.	0.7771696130283743
This is what has come of rushing headlong into enlargement and not clearly defining roles and tasks.	0.5414573828702189
We have built a Europe with an unstable market, not a Europe with principles, rights and politics.	0.9550265175096114
And these are the consequences!	0.7434844675183881
Therefore, we can but call on the Commission to continue to show restraint and praise those who are working to safeguard the independence and sovereignty of the Austrian people, thereby ensuring that this people retains its freedoms and maintains good relations with other peoples.	0.9005322501921958
Madam President, today we have an appointment with hypocrisy.	0.8307994668096886
Here we have a Council which has managed to flout the treaty and employ a method completely unrelated to Articles 6 and 7 which make it possible to condemn a State in the event of a serious and persistent breach.	0.6625340978312495
In the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach in Austria.	0.5114970522821057
There are risks, as we are all aware, but in the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach.	1.1186248277900297
If we were to apply the criteria of Articles 6 and 7 or the Copenhagen criteria to the European Union, then, most certainly, this European Union could not become a member, although the countries of Eastern Europe are required to meet them.	0.9948620503334884
And if we were to speak of serious and persistent breaches, then perhaps we could mention some Member States, such as Italy and France, first and third, respectively, in the list of countries condemned by the Council of Europe and the Strasbourg court.	0.9473292298967103
We could mention, my Belgian friends, Belgium and the Dutroux case, the dozens upon dozens of children kidnapped, tortured, raped and murdered by leading personalities in this country, where inquiries are bogged down, making no headway.	0.6555946836164094
We could, if one third of the Members of Parliament so requested, require that the Council and the Commission look into the matter.	1.043967813859771
We could ask ourselves why the Austrians are rejecting 10 years, 13 years of party politics which has made one country - Austria - corrupt and rotten, just as it is now corrupting countries such as Italy, Belgium and other European Union Member States.	0.7229619392100506
We might well wonder why 76% of Belgian citizens have no faith in the justice system in their country or why 56% of French citizens have no confidence in their country' s system of justice, and 53% of Italian citizens have absolutely no confidence in Italian justice...	0.7355871481438936
(The President cut the speaker off)	0.07650392215616267
Madame President, my group, the EDD, and especially my party, are very concerned by this debate.	1.1119786366074775
We cannot, and we do not, support in any way the sentiments and politics of Herr Haider and we deplore his references to the Third Reich.	0.8369749676381377
We also, however, deplore the fact that your Parliament should consider interfering in the policies of an elected government of any country, especially one which is part of the European Union.	0.7861741778881837
My party at home are certainly not racists, but we do not accept the rule or interference of the European Union very well.	0.897589518339312
Are you going to interfere with Great Britain' s Parliament if we are elected?	0.5250943007090617
Madame President, the people of Austria have spoken by electing Herr Haider to their Parliament.	0.7073631500158648
I believe they gave him 28% of the vote so there is going to be a coalition government.	0.81241582119558
Your Parliament, may I suggest, Madame President, should wait to see if the party of Haider has an effect on the policies of that country.	0.8566823190588428
Then, and only then, might you consider if human rights are affected.	0.8238790170029714
Your Parliament may consider measures appropriate to counter that situation and then, Madame President and only then, may your Parliament consider interfering in the constitutional affairs of a country of the European Union.	0.630842797554889
Madam President, as a representative of the Freedom Party, I respect the concerns some of my fellow MEPs have with regard to the democratic developments in Austria.	1.0546324269924492
My reaction may come as a surprise when I say that I personally am at a loss as to the heightened sensitivity displayed towards Austria in matters of respect for human rights, having a sense of responsibility for one' s own past, and the stability of democracy.	0.8375533511940196
Austria must take the responsibility on its own shoulders for the often dubious image other countries tend to have of it, rightly or wrongly.	0.5604576337215108
The refusal of our government, down through the years, to acknowledge our complicity in the horrors of the Second World War, together with their refusal to properly compensate the Jewish victims and those forced into hard labour, have done a great deal to bolster this negative image.	0.6547883664835356
This FPÖ has now entered into a coalition with the ÖVP, due to the outcome of elections held on 3 October 1999, when the previous government was voted out of office.	0.6324102598449147
This is the citizen of a state' s prerogative, for it is the founding principle of a democracy.	0.9672970380778412
When the talks between the SPÖ and ÖVP broke down, the Socialists attempted to form a minority government and asked the FPÖ for their support.	0.6414628613881487
We were offered three ministerial posts - you can read it for yourself in the newspapers - the very party that is being denounced as fascistic here!	0.7513995548339627
When we suddenly refused this offer, an inflammatory and rabble-rousing propaganda campaign began that is beyond our comprehension to this day.	0.4562746024923715
The FPÖ party is established in Austria' s political landscape.	0.5699141735304502
The head of the government of one of the nine provinces belongs to this party and it is involved in all the other provincial governments.	0.8826317253453233
What many Austrians are wondering today is why their democratic decision has suddenly been interpreted as an expression of a fascistic cast of mind, and why the campaign did not begin until the Freedom Party rejected the support of a minority government comprising the SPÖ?	0.679743154191825
There is prejudice at work here, which - without going into our programme - is reducing the darkest hour of European history to a political spectacle.	0.8500248658349455
I am filled with disgust when certain of our opponents get mileage out of the millions of deaths that took place in the gas chambers of the concentration camps as cheap propaganda, as, for example, the Italian MEP Bertinotti did yesterday on Italian TV when he accused Mr Haider of denying the holocaust.	0.5823453808034181
Shame on you Mr Bertinotti!	0.2465579517401135
You might have run out of political arguments but that does not give you the right to use those who were murdered as cheap propaganda.	0.6528674225601925
Denouncing a democratically elected politician as a Nazi does not make you an anti-fascist!	0.4770589969434238
On the contrary, you are deriding the true victims of National Socialism and playing down what the fascist dictators did.	0.49257377049750345
Your behaviour stems from your own prejudices, you are dispensing with any form of political debate and you are displaying precisely the kind of behaviour you claim to oppose.	0.6019707018392627
The attacks against Austria' s new government and the attempts to exert political influence in a Member State are an insult to the Austrian people.	0.6151437791782149
That is why we are indebted to the Commission for taking a stance that separates it from the rest.	0.9682272667140698
The new coalition agreement is about reforming a democracy, the rights of the opposition, commitment to compensating those forced into hard labour....	0.5839666738958036
(The President cut the speaker off)	0.07650392215616267
Madam President, to begin with, I would like to make one thing abundantly clear: Austria is not in danger of experiencing a resurgence of a one-party system or of a totalitarian system of right-wing persuasion.	0.8024074820678032
Austria is a stable democracy; one in which human rights and fundamental freedoms are guaranteed under the constitution and are afforded the protection of an independent judiciary.	0.7044520425579894
Austria is a cosmopolitan country and xenophobia and discrimination have no place there.	0.45264432525646797
There is nothing unusual about what is happening in Austria: there has been a changeover of power following democratic elections, in consequence of which an old system was voted out and a stable parliamentary majority prepared to carry out the necessary economic and social reforms was sought and found.	0.745401699444749
There will be a functioning majority and likewise a functioning opposition.	0.6425427872220136
The Austrian People' s Party, which I represent here in this Parliament, used to be and still is a party that has consistently spoken up for the integration of my country into the EU and feels deeply attached to the community of values that is the European Union, and likewise its basic political principles of deepening and enlargement.	0.9123330971412719
We respect and accept the discussion that is taking place and also appreciate the concerns that are being voiced in many of our Member States as to the way ahead for Austria.	0.8082522519210409
Our understanding springs from the knowledge that our history of the recent past has bequeathed to us a political responsibility of special importance in the present.	0.6914519734638946
Our country was not just the first victim of the Hitler dictatorship, many people were perpetrators too, although I refute any suggestion of collective guilt.	0.7467274072044402
The ÖVP played no small part in helping Austria find its way into the European Union.	0.435826905872124
My country' s place is not outside the European Union but in it ...	0.6499739131979057
..., with all the rights and commitments that this entails!	0.836313420017824
Any future government must therefore be judged according to the values and principles it professes to in its manifesto, and not according to the prejudgements put about both by political adversaries and the international media.	0.7219310276755037
A declared belief in human rights, democracy and the rule of law, in an honest reappraisal of Austria' s role in the past, in passing on information on the gravest crime against humanity in the 20th century, the holocaust, will also be reflected in the fundamental accord underlying a future coalition government between the ÖVP and FPÖ.	0.767397229897599
My party can be relied upon to see to it that my country holds firm to the course of European politics and continues to be rooted in the European community of values!	0.7720674508003976
(Applause)	-0.0
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Representatives of the Commission, it is a black day for Austria and for Europe.	0.6820513107679608
Not even Mr Sichrovsky' s web of lies or Mrs Stenzel' s words of appeasement can do anything to change that.	0.4387080188417955
For the day has dawned: two irresponsible politicians, consumed with a lust for power, are selling Austria' s image, political role, and to some extent even its economic interests, down the river!	0.7312000205920085
(Applause, heckling)	0.2574258362435608
They are trading this in for a head of government' s position and for membership of a government.	0.727453806337681
They are just as prepared to take on board the fact that Austria will go from being a revered country to a reviled one, as they are its threatened isolation and thus to some extent that of its citizens.	0.8131041776877568
I believe - as do many who for years have campaigned against Haider and his brand of politics, and especially my colleagues in the Social Democratic delegation in this Chamber - that the various measures announced by the international community, insofar as they do not have any bearing on the government and its representatives, are grave and also inappropriate.	0.9378708232604648
However, my criticism - and I freely admit this - my rage, is directed exclusively against those who have provoked these reactions and continue to do so, Messrs Schüssel and Haider and their parties, ...	0.8134737465932901
... and that includes their representatives in this Parliament.	1.0662755786780969
Mr Poettering, it is interesting to note that you are in almost as difficult a position as I am, albeit for different reasons, for you are having to defend something that goes against your convictions.	0.8514018896707229
You are having to defend a certain Mr Schüssel, you are having to consort with Schüssel as he is today and who, as I understand it, was recently told not to come to the representatives of the Christian Democratic party' s summit meeting.	0.815341302008454
The argument that Mr Poettering himself used has come into play, i.e. that it would only be possible to deprive Haider of his mystique if he were to be integrated into the political system.	0.8443926030442579
However, in my view, he will be no more able or willing to be integrated into this, into our political system, and into the Europe of today, than any other extreme right-wing movement.	0.9284512710304701
Anyone who feeds on prejudice towards foreigners and ethnic minorities and gives succour to these prejudices, whose programme features parochialism and anti-liberalism, who displays loutish behaviour and arrogance in their international relations, and who has never yet distanced themselves clearly and unequivocally from National Socialism, has neither the intention nor inclination to integrate!	0.6088029533749245
(Applause)	-0.0
This historic weight of guilt falls on the shoulders of the Conservatives for having consorted with the wolf of their own free will and waiting to be devoured.	0.449178726133987
That is how the wolf - albeit on account of the self-sacrifice of the ÖVP - is sustained rather than kept in check.	0.6672773567751097
I understand that Europe and the civilised world wants to have as little as possible to do with such a government.	0.8695068052384503
However, by the same token, there is another Austria, the one where umpteen thousand people demonstrated against the FPÖ having any involvement in government, and who will continue to demonstrate against this government.	0.968060524948123
I urge you to support this Europe and to support and help this Austria!	0.9107226078277225
(Applause)	-0.0
The more powerful this Europe becomes and the more vigilant it is towards authoritarian tendencies in the Europe of today, the more successful we will be in striking at the roots of right-wing extremism.	0.7062367512206836
For Europe is and will remain the most potent guarantee we have against xenophobia and demagogy, or even against a relapse into barbarism.	0.7027634365778053
Please support the Austrian people against this government!	0.5878338231061173
(Applause)	-0.0
Madam President, this is an historic moment, as it is now, at last, quite clear to us all that the European Union has gradually developed into a community of values.	1.2424697799804258
We see this, now that the government of one Member State is being joined by a party which, as is known, does not respect all these values.	0.8760919473604029
I would also like to say that the position of the fourteen states emanating from the Council was justified, as in a way this is also a matter of the composition of the government of the European Union, meaning this is also a matter for the Council and not merely an internal affair of Austria' s.	1.110634577101552
As Members of Parliament, we must pay particular attention to the fact that the work begun to establish fundamental rights is more important than ever.	1.0096182813460939
It is more important than ever that respect for, and non-violation of, human values and the rights of minorities, including the rights of all those who live within the territory of the European Union, form an essential component in the rule of law principle of the EU, and, for this reason, the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding.	1.0184421061993578
It must not be allowed to remain a mere declaration.	0.6258646183534827
As important is the fact that Austria' s forces of democracy should be given support, as none of us wishes to isolate the country.	0.8015341331084205
We know that most Austrians respect these values.	0.4445602956279602
They have also shown how they feel: not all the demonstrations have taken place outside Austria.	0.6436789976574724
Doubtless there are also a lot of protest voters on the scene that have wanted a change in Austrian policy for a long time.	0.6103499924986668
I believe Parliament should support these forces of democracy.	0.37916632764254143
I also appeal to the Austrian President, that he might yet look into all the possibilities for forming a government made up of democratic forces.	0.7972810700411629
Madam President, I would simply like to stress the value of the attitude that the leader of our group, Francis Wurtz, reminded us of just now.	0.8818533210849756
I welcome the statements by the Presidency of the Council and the position of the 14 countries which have rejected official contact with an Austrian Government that includes Jörg Haider' s party.	0.8127435802949122
The fact that we are stressing this is all the more important because, as you know, we essentially disagree with the policies made by Europe, with its economic and social policies, its democratic deficit and the Member States' involvement in the terrible war in the Balkans.	1.0292580609398958
Our normal disagreement further emphasises our appreciation today: this is extraordinary because the danger of a resurgence of an irrational, neo-nazi element in Europe is extraordinary.	0.5556143287121634
This danger does not concern Austria, it concerns Europe.	0.7597432423740124
We are talking about us, not Austria.	0.7322275453501048
We know the social causes which contribute, along with unemployment and instability, to fuelling tendencies towards this; we know the accompanying cultural causes - xenophobia, racism - but with the inability and unwillingness of these extreme right-wing groups to settle accounts with nazism, we cannot fail to point out the possibility of an explosive mixture being created in Europe.	0.8001658841734196
Not only the Alpine region, but all our countries are involved: the conditions are being created whereby democracy and European civilisation may once again come under threat.	0.798261823079034
The position taken by the presidency has shown that it is aware of this tragedy for civilisation.	0.896878699306525
Europe is showing that it has not forgotten Auschwitz; Europe is coming face to face with the suffering of the past.	0.6577890881734235
Now, though, it should follow through with its actions, and the first to follow through should be the Commission, which, however, has been obscure and weak on this, making the value of the presidency' s position even more apparent.	1.0347443455021992
This is the change we must impose on the Commission' s action.	0.7234398076652635
Madam President, despite the fundamental democratic principle of the respect for human rights and the freedom and sovereignty of peoples, which opposes fascism, nazism or communism, both new and old, and despite all the previous speakers talking about the sovereignty of the Austrian people, we are today witnessing this sovereignty being denied by Parliament.	0.8996053981487092
In the manifesto of the Austrian Democratic Freedom Party, there is nothing to justify the accusations that it is attacking the principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms or the rule of law, enshrined in Article 6 of the Treaties.	0.7687291608913547
I would, however, like to draw your attention to the fact that the President-in-Office, who has been so critical of Austria, has recently consigned the inhabitants of Macao to the sovereign rule of the People' s Democratic Republic of China.	0.8138362928731843
Perhaps, in order to strengthen the Union' s democracy, it would now be appropriate to isolate Austria and criminalise a party that was democratically elected by the Austrian citizens, while bringing Turkey and its "Grey Wolves" into Europe.	0.764635591614609
Madam President, we are debating an extremely serious issue.	1.0424706772744472
We are debating nothing less than the presence in a Member State' s government of a political force whose doctrine and principles are incompatible with the conceptual and moral bases of the Union enshrined in its founding Treaties.	0.7727208233182925
A simple reading of chapter 4, article 1 of the Austrian Freedom Party' s manifesto is enough to make any democratic conscience shudder.	0.6873720834510494
The view that ethnicity is the defining factor of a nation and the claim that one ethnic group has superiority over others, as is written here, revives old ghosts of the century which we have just left behind, which some historians have described as the century of horrors; horrors which the unacceptable philosophy behind Mr Haider' s manifesto has stirred up once again, to our amazement.	0.7399682548569899
Of course Austria is a sovereign nation and of course we must respect the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of a Member State.	0.7275863827203232
However, that is not the problem.	1.3379036568140519
The question is whether the Union can remain indifferent to the formation of a government in a Member State which includes such a party.	0.8522104079513448
Our answer to this crucial question is no.	0.5199814424060146
Leaving aside strategic and tactical considerations, leaving aside possible exonerations based on other people' s behaviour and above and beyond party and electoral interests, the Spanish delegation of the People' s Group of this Parliament, in full agreement with the Spanish People' s Party and the Spanish Government, clearly expresses its full agreement with the statement of 31 January by the Portuguese Presidency of the Council.	0.7779842419281572
We agree with its substance, its tone and its scope.	0.7080536621117444
(Applause)	-0.0
Konrad Adenauer once said - and he knew what he was saying - that the surest way to pacify a tiger was to allow it to devour you.	0.6740766782292968
History is a compendium of events which could have been avoided.	0.532405782892173
Therefore, Madam President, the Union and the Assembly must send an unequivocal message, rejecting of the tiger of intolerance, xenophobia and totalitarianism, so as not to add one more mistake to the long list of abdications, renunciations and opportunism which mark Europe' s past and for which we have paid such a heavy price.	0.6576649322648728
(Loud applause)	0.016053958295031215
Madam President, the European Union was built upon the idea 'never again' , meaning never again do we want to see xenophobia, concentration camps, anti-Semitism, heightened nationalism or war.	0.673563224743273
The one and only significance of the European Union is the will to transcend the atrocious history of the twentieth century which gave the coup de grâce to any ideal of humanism within the heart of Europe, and which is still highly topical today.	0.7959115263322257
It is not true to say that, when a government forms an alliance with neo-Fascists somewhere in Europe, this is merely a question of national sovereignty.	0.8899993858766889
For this Union of ours is not a grouping of neighbouring nation states who are simply coming to mutual arrangements to improve their collective circumstances.	0.6029481310204172
It is a Community that is destined to exist, in which, when the main thing is under threat, when values are under threat, all democrats must bend over backwards to find solutions to ensure that the mistakes of the past are never made again.	0.8769605665465056
Let us learn the lessons of the past.	0.5362281561920432
In the thirties, when Adolf Hitler was democratically elected, although with a minority, many people thought that it was not as bad as all that and, Mr Poettering, in France, a number of men and women, on the right wing but perhaps of other political persuasions too, thought, 'Better Hitler in France than the Front Populaire.'	0.8563406650385367
They put their own petty squabbles first, and the rest is history.	0.7583777068031936
We must make a rapid, strong and united response.	0.6694239054553955
I would have liked to hear your discussion with the Austrian President, Mr Poettering. We are well aware that he is very embarrassed today at the dirty deal that government has done in forming such an alliance.	0.8886665358805194
So our response must be rapid and strong.	0.3499015422078077
Of course, the Treaty provides us with a barrier when things become intolerable; I was almost going to say 'irreparable' .	0.7740995937675536
History has taught us that Fascists start to blow hot and cold: using heated words first, in populist, xenophobic speeches, and then cool words in order to make themselves acceptable to institutions and to infiltrate them gradually, poisoning them, until the day they start to take action.	0.6970059320798512
And when that day comes, it is too late.	0.7209516448261891
So our Treaty has made provision for barriers for the time when it is too late, but we are not at that point: today we have to take steps to ensure that we do not get to that point.	1.0995513158607293
We must therefore find a political solution.	0.7150121443975637
I support the Council proposals in this, while deploring a certain lack of strength, a certain spinelessness, on the part of the Commission which will, however, have to be vigilant on a day-by-day basis, with determination over time, since Fascists count on the spinelessness of democracy, they count on time to wear us down and they hope to impose their views in the end.	0.892469606831249
Our response must be rapid.	0.26390468684534213
If today we do not staunchly support the Council, then history will judge us, saying that we achieved the political equivalent of the Munich Agreement.	0.6778371268277646
Madam President, I am pleased about the fact that, in Austria, the will of the large majority of the people is being respected and that this formation of government constitutes, in my eyes, a huge victory for democracy.	1.0635532833759145
Let there be no doubt about it: we decline with thanks a Europe which develops into a kind of "big brother" and which keeps watch over left-wing political correctness in one Member State or another in a Stalinist way and using Stalinist methods.	0.6930765681240713
European democracy and Austrian democracy should not receive any lessons from anybody and certainly not from a Belgian Government that embraces corrupt parties financed by arms dealers and that appointed the leader of such a corrupt party, which was condemned by the court, to the post of European Commissioner.	0.7626177620025666
Today, we thank the Austrian people for this democratic triumph which is important to all nations within Europe and to anyone who feels particularly strongly about freedom and freedom of speech.	0.8136096874572561
Madam President, this debate was opened by Mr Da Costa, who merely confirms that the EU presidency is trying to influence the composition of a government of one of the Member States.	0.9036540312236104
This debate, and the background to it, reinforced the point that the Council, the Commission and this Parliament itself are dominated by Socialists.	1.0787179062604761
My delegation of 37 Conservative and Unionist Members from the United Kingdom reject absolutely the underlying philosophy, programme and tone of Austria' s Freedom Party.	0.4765134214806191
We share the widespread outrage at its attitude to history, in particular World War II, but also its policies on enlargement, on immigration, on race and its attitude to the European Union itself.	1.009862461351235
We were also outraged, however, at the tolerance of the left for the tyranny, the terror and the excesses of the former USSR.	0.7252373242528044
Even today, surely it is high time for the Party of European Socialists to break their fraternal links with China' s Communist Party.	0.5648019588178654
Not a word was said by these same EU governments about coalition governments involving fellow-travelling communists in French or Italian governments, or in German state governments, or even the British government' s willingness to promote those with terrorist associations as ministers in Northern Ireland today.	0.6551971011176336
This, Madam President, is the hypocrisy of the left.	0.8486243757981243
So we condemn that hypocrisy and the double standards, especially of the British government and the other largely socialist heads of EU governments and include that of the United States.	0.8288080032383262
We should recognise, however, that the democratic process sometimes produces uncomfortable results.	0.6500409345742937
This requires action to address the underlying causes, including an examination of the electoral process itself.	0.7540873821350005
That should be our task, not political posturing.	0.897538432288696
Madam President, Representative of the Council, Commissioner, a week ago, the big international Holocaust Conference ended in Stockholm.	0.789581606290176
Its aim was to combat the forgetfulness and the evil in today' s society which takes the form of xenophobia and neo-nazism.	0.5837092775861646
It would be an insult to the idea behind this conference and to the whole of the international community to invite, at this time, into the institutions of the EU, a xenophobic party which flirts with Nazi ideas.	0.9965513485160769
Secondly, I want to say that we must be consistent in our own behaviour and in our evaluations.	1.1868109272647736
We demand of the candidate States and of the countries with which the EU cooperates under the Lomé Agreement that they should respect human rights and show tolerance towards their neighbours.	0.875960269335042
We must do the same as far as we ourselves are concerned.	0.928075634513011
That is why we are reacting against this carry-on in Austria.	0.6148189251316094
It is not acceptable to continue as if nothing had happened.	0.837790735416612
We are at a watershed in the history of the European Union.	0.6808425500211011
The Union is not only an economic community but also a community of values, something which we take seriously. Something has happened.	0.9859566929182526
The European Union is in the process of finding its soul and getting some steel in its spine.	0.7702543434911279
Madam President, as everyone has said, this is a very important day. It is the day of the first debate of European political life.	1.168776605829886
And this is not pure chance.	0.8778158688988478
I feel that today' s meeting is not a meeting of Europe, our institutions, with Austria or Mr Haider' s party.	0.9620236033293715
It is the meeting of Europe with itself, with its raison d' être, with the reasons why we are here in this Chamber.	1.1404941645073399
This Chamber was not made for goods, it was not made for money.	0.8769310025116887
This Chamber, and the European institutions, were build to uphold values, morality and a certain spirit.	0.9498594422918069
In the twentieth century, we have had experience of the fact that democracies can find themselves at risk, and morality, values and the spirit which I mentioned can be mortally affected by viruses which have just one name: nationalist glorification, populism and the concept of racial superiority.	0.6983899123001861
The fact is that it is enough to read the manifesto of Mr Haider' s party, the FPÖ, to find nationalist glorification, populism and racial superiority in every chapter.	0.7684268997049496
Reading only one sentence which my friend, Mr Vidal-Quadras, has previously mentioned, "The nation is defined by its location, culture and race, locally, ethnically and culturally."	0.6562116214666516
Well, we cannot accept such statements.	1.1048374832979408
If Europe has any meaning, and - my friends will pardon me telling them - if Christian democracy has any meaning, if the history of Christian democracy has any meaning, then it must declare itself radically opposed to the statements made in this manifesto and, whatever excellent reasons are given whenever history serves the same dish up again, must reject any agreement with this type of ideology and this type of organisation.	0.7550671555474862
This is the reason why I feel that the European Parliament, which has more freedom of action and more freedom to speak than the Council or the Commission, must pay tribute to those people in the various States and European institutions who had the courage to say no, and it must say, Madam President, that you made a statement on our behalf which does us credit, and in clear terms declare, without prevarication, its opposition to and condemnation of imminent events in Austria, recalling the statement made on the day of the Munich Agreement by a great French Christian Democrat who said that, if you are going to have to say no, then the best time to do so is right at the beginning.	0.9831910797194598
(Applause)	-0.0
Madam President, we the Belgian Christian Democrats are concerned as, fortunately, are a great many other Members too.	0.8981882722360451
The coalition which is being created in one of the Member States is clearly an Austrian affair but undoubtedly has a European dimension too.	0.7685781349405351
Because what is it that unites us in Europe? Surely it is the values and principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights, more than anything.	0.8015972977355946
The Austrian Freedom Party leader, Mr Haider, has repeatedly repudiated these values.	0.7316955005501145
He also repudiates the basic forms of diplomatic politeness.	0.2781527733206739
He is a dangerous man.	0.6880861542264031
The Christian Democratic parties in my country have made up their minds a long time ago and they stick to their decision to listen to the protests of extreme-right voters but never to negotiate with extreme-right leaders.	0.6490141165723036
Values should take precedence over power.	0.2297363316580248
We deplore, therefore, what is happening in Austria.	0.6977537509437162
In fact, we were shaken by it.	0.8549385644342886
We are extremely disappointed.	0.4679126321512858
As a last resort, we would ask the ÖVP to look into alternatives.	0.9417840334639882
We keep reminding them about Article 6 of the Treaty.	0.3852046268225591
We continue to fight against the trivialisation of the extreme right.	0.5746094816248807
If, despite this, the coalition goes ahead, we would urge the ÖVP party members to ensure that the principles and values which underlie European integration are observed in political programmes, both in word and deed.	0.9701136667867242
Madam President, Austria awaits a heavy responsibility.	0.5860150731008753
Madam President, it is clear that we in this Parliament are very largely agreed on rejecting Mr Haider and his politics, but it is equally clear that opinion differs as to the most effective way of opposing this brand of politics.	0.930466867112641
Have you stopped to ask what kind of effect the debate we are having here and the statement delivered by the Council Presidency last weekend are having in Austria itself?	0.7747524580357997
Have you stopped to ask whether or not we will also be responsible for the way in which the political situation unfolds from now if we set ourselves up to pass judgement on it here?	0.7176106253399763
Have you stopped to ask what would happen if the wish of a certain fellow MEP was to be fulfilled and elections were to be held in Austria in the course of the next few days?	0.8028257910221486
From all accounts, this would only serve to strengthen Haider.	0.8451792095447241
Who would want this to happen?	0.45633722992647513
Is it not our responsibility to give thought to how we should tackle this brand of politics?	0.5979757976905664
Europe is a community of law.	0.8618214376332193
Democracy, respect for human rights and rule of law are amongst the principles that we must uphold.	0.736238292520975
One of the precepts of democracy is that we should not disapprove of electoral outcomes but respect them, and that is why we must respect the fact that the Austrians, by virtue of their political culture, voted as they did.	0.927006718616022
It is for reasons of constitutionality that the President-in-Office of the Council ought not to have made the statement he did, and in a manner that goes against the Treaty.	0.9343328671539245
It would be politically astute not to isolate the ÖVP but to support it as an undeniably democratic, constitutional and well-known European party, so as to be equally certain that Austria will continue to be a Member of this European Community, and that is why we must give the ÖVP our support in this difficult situation, and isolation would be altogether the wrong line to take!	0.9253537998376901
(Applause)	-0.0
Madam President, they say, where I come from, 'it' s three times for a Welshman' , and three times, as I think you will discover in the course of that debate, I signified my desire to respond very briefly to what has been an excellent, and on several occasions, a moving debate.	0.978999746604999
First of all, could I express my thanks on behalf of President Prodi and my colleagues in the Commission for the support and understanding offered by several Members of the House to the position taken by the Commission in the statement that we made yesterday.	1.0872755396833034
I must respond also to the fact, of course, that there were references during the debate - and I use some of the words employed - to the ambiguity, the complacency and the fragility of the Commission' s opinion.	0.9975109063670271
I am duty- bound to say to this House, there is no ambiguity or fragility or complacency in the opinion offered, or indeed the action taken, by the Commission on this issue.	1.0546383950777656
We made explicit reference yesterday morning in our statement, as did the President this afternoon, to the fact that we share the concern demonstrated by fourteen Member States in their statement on Monday.	0.9224179022287674
Secondly, we said, in very specific terms, that we will work closely with all Member States in examining the situation as it develops in Austria.	1.0765579056237795
Thirdly, we expressed, in very explicit terms, that we will uphold without fear or favour the values and the provisions of Article 6 of the Treaty; and that we will take our part under Article 7 of the Treaty in ensuring that those values of liberty and democracy and fundamental freedoms are upheld.	1.0768839296920971
There is no complacency, no fragility and no ambiguity about any of that at all.	0.7220539747639292
And, when I say that the Commission took that view, I include my dear colleague Franz Fischler, who is from Austria; and who, once again, demonstrated his integrity and his independence as a Member of the European Commission, under oath, in being part of that statement that we made yesterday morning.	0.9626166468289905
Anyone, therefore, who invites Franz Fischler to his house to somehow account for the fact that his nationality is Austrian, should examine their own motives in the context of a debate, which has been necessarily shadowed by references to xenophobia and even more lethal evils in this world.	0.661336067037054
I say that in friendship and honour to my friend and colleague, Franz Fischler.	0.6138924581154975
Could I also say, Madam President, that the understanding of the presidency, the Portuguese presidency, for our position, was absolutely demonstrated in the clearest terms by Mr Da Costa when he said, and I quote him, that 'Portugal and the other Member States want to ensure that the working of the Community machine is not affected by the current situation' .	1.0057477843388223
That surely is in everyone' s interests.	0.37167443392250266
In order to ensure that the Treaty is upheld and that we sustain what was described as the Community machine, we are following the course of action which was set down in our statement yesterday.	0.9344640190785647
We will continue to do that, Madam President, without fear or favour.	0.7967562469601326
That is our duty.	0.6369857554944417
It is also a matter of conviction.	0.949333242041008
My final point is this.	0.33748515423651715
We understand the context of this essential debate.	0.45804157890644487
There are several people here who like myself for many years past have become familiar with Herr Haider' s offensive statements, the xenophobia of many of his policy elements and the strategy that he has developed of alternating aggressive statements with apologies, sometimes on successive days.	0.6518852449434687
We understand that, and we recall too the sometimes short and selective memory that he has of Nazism.	0.7910796075265674
And, when we recall that, like many others on all sides of this House, my and my colleagues' instincts are naturally aroused.	0.9866985185641195
However, the Commission has to act on the basis of values and law and not only on the basis of instinct.	1.0334588170583119
And that is why we came to the conclusion we reached yesterday morning.	0.7474443088103891
That is why we sustain that conclusion as we continue to uphold the values and the law. Without fragility, without complacency, without ambiguity, but in the service of the whole Union and every Member State of the Union and its people.	1.1096136253315942
We will continue to do that with energy and with consistency and as Mr Cox said in the debate, 'necessarily with acute vigilance' .	0.7314516665663952
I wonder, since Mr Da Costa has been listening to these remarks from the back of the Chamber, whether Mr Kinnock could confirm that the Commission supports the view explicitly stated by Mr Da Costa today and in the recent statement by the Presidency on behalf of the heads of government.	0.8220623260050595
Does the Commission support the Council?	0.6497865800147935
Madam President, when the Commission said yesterday morning that it notes the views expressed as a joint statement by fourteen Member States and shares the concern that gave rise to that view, I think it can be taken for granted that since yesterday morning, as soon as the Commission could discuss the issue, it has had a view consistent with that of fourteen of the Member States.	1.0110673621461361
Thank you, Commissioner Kinnock.	0.8339008111523093
I think that we have just had a great political debate, equal to the situation and to what could be expected of it.	1.0592915766428512
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.	0.5498028953167883
The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed.	0.44618730245892585
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	0.36329844710970927
Recourse to the precautionary principle	0.14159132739954575
The next item is the Commission statement on recourse to the precautionary principle.	0.562020811959769
I want to start by saying that I am pleased to be presenting this communication on the use of the precautionary principle, and it has been written together with David Byrne and Erkki Liikanen.	0.868645589364366
The precautionary principle is not a new concept.	0.8492877857821001
It has been used by the Community for some time now in a range of policy areas, environmental, human, animal and plant health; and it is explicitly mentioned in the environmental provisions of the EC Treaty since Maastricht.	0.8741226438929673
It also appears in a range of international texts, for example, the Rio Declaration and most recently the Bio-Safety Protocol.	0.5695468239606651
The essence of the precautionary principle is clear.	0.4481740762867667
It involves taking action in a given policy area when the science is not clear, but where there are reasonable grounds for concern that the potential risks are big enough to require action.	0.7202287996843562
However, the use of the precautionary principle has been increasingly in the spotlight in recent years.	0.7596343641166478
Events such as the BSE and dioxin crisis have stimulated a growing public debate about the circumstances in which precautionary action is justified and necessary.	0.5319447008664743
In view of this growing interest, the Commission therefore considered that it would be useful to present a communication to set out its position on the use of the precautionary principle.	1.022875398756206
The basic aim of the communication is twofold.	0.6388597071568372
To explain in a clear and coherent way how the Commission applies, and intends to apply, the precautionary principle in its management of risk and to set out guidelines for its application based on reasoned and coherent principles.	0.7395332947432225
We also hope that the communication will help to build a better common understanding of how to manage risks and to dispel fears that the precautionary principle might be used in an arbitrary way or as a disguised form of trade protectionism.	0.6502039541258089
The Commission' s starting point in applying the precautionary principle is the need to ensure a high level of protection in the fields of environmental, human, animal and plant health.	0.8098540678814935
Of course, this objective cannot be used to justify irrational or arbitrary measures, but it does mean that action can still be taken even in situations where the science is unclear.	0.8022565186934679
As such, while the precautionary principle does not involve the politicisation of science, as some have alleged, it does take us to the crossroads between science and politics.	0.8623682924827527
The initial decision to apply the precautionary principle depends largely on the level of protection sought and the level of risk that decision-makers are prepared to accept for society.	0.6206661299789048
It is therefore political by nature.	0.6277397861560351
However, the measures that may subsequently be taken must obviously comply with the general principles applicable to risk management and the guidelines for applying the precautionary principle are therefore the key element of the paper.	0.7963792484930846
Measures taken must be proportional to the chosen level of protection - that is, we do not use the sledgehammer to crack a nut.	0.7613887904082959
They must be non-discriminatory in their application, that is measures should not differentiate on the basis of geographical origin.	0.6458393461023719
And they must be consistent with similar measures already taken.	0.6477972058574587
For example, if one product has been approved, similar products should also be approved.	0.8148742873285794
Measures are based on an examination of the potential benefits and costs of action or lack of action; that is, the measures should be cost-effective and subject to review in the light of new scientific data and be clear about who is responsible for producing the scientific evidence necessary for a more comprehensive risk assessment, that is the burden of proof.	0.8304602994626799
All these elements have to apply cumulatively.	0.45176546913383775
It is also important to bear in mind that there are a wide range of measures, which can be taken in applying the precautionary principle. For example, a research programme, public information campaigns, recommendations and so on.	0.9983412314142689
Applying the precautionary principle does not, therefore, automatically imply a ban.	0.36301392011570094
This communication does not pretend to be the final word on this issue; however, it is the first time that the Commission has presented a structured presentation of the principle and its operational use.	1.0303733540175681
By setting out in some detail how the Commission applies, and intends to apply, the precautionary principle, we hope to be able to clarify the situation at Community level and to contribute to the ongoing debate at European and international level.	0.8307082572964637
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for your statement.	0.6166080536121876
I have three short questions, the first being as follows.	0.8307143070786156
We have been awaiting a common communication from the Commission on the precautionary principle for a very long time now and it was anything but clear in the past as to whether the Commission speaks with one voice.	0.9888850571459162
Does the document you have presented here today also accord with the opinion of your colleagues the Commissioners for Industry, Foreign Trade, Competition and the Internal Market?	0.6971238210133909
I am sure that your answer to this will be "yes" but I would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentlemen are also aware as to what the consequences of this will be?	1.0130718829932601
My next question, Mrs Wallström, is when will you begin to apply this principle to legislation; to legislation pertaining to chemicals or other sectors, for example?	0.8680257224322755
Lastly, will we be able to recognise when this principle has been applied in legislation?	0.6980684501594348
In other words, will each proposal contain an additional sheet stating that checks have been made as to the application of the precautionary principle and the following conclusion has been reached?	0.7309712807967577
. Thank you very much, Dagmar Roth-Behrendt, for these questions.	0.656145013349191
Of course, this is shared by the whole Commission.	0.75136062492395
This is a common communication which was written by the three of us, David Byrne, Erkki Liikanen and myself, but it has been passed unanimously in the Commission today.	0.9207990710689303
It received strong support from the rest of the Commissioners and it has been through an interservice consultation in the whole of the Commission.	0.7791850727134342
So we have really worked through this document and I am sure that they are all able to describe the guidelines and the principles as laid down in this document.	0.7911587832598349
Yes, I would say we already use this way of working with different, difficult issues like a new chemical strategy for example.	0.8544265981525633
And, I am sure that we will also mention it explicitly when we work with this principle.	1.0754084835873035
We have just recently had a case of using the precautionary principle when it came to ban phthalates in soft PVC toys; and of course, we apply it in several different environmental areas.	0.6934465681409907
It has been mainly used in the environmental field, but, of course also when it comes to human health.	1.0341786185419288
So, we will try to be very clear about how and when to use it.	0.9488381925401009
Mr President, Commissioner, regarding the relationship between science, on the one hand, and applying the precautionary principle on the other, the communication states that invoking that precautionary principle always requires a political decision if there is a lack of scientific evidence.	0.727024189995966
Needless to say, this accords science a great deal of power.	0.6060084156881705
We might ask ourselves, what kind of scientists will supply this documentation and what do they stand for?	0.5999647500230263
The communication also states that the precautionary principle can be applied, provided there is a sufficient recognised minority of scientists.	0.7080073582153996
I would like to ask, what is, then, the definition of a recognised minority?	1.0037945707357394
How would you describe this?	0.27658306801475807
What establishes a recognised minority?	0.1500032437252284
If a political decision is involved, I would also like to ask: who takes this political decision?	0.8233293610949374
The Commission?	-0.0
The Council?	-0.0
And to what extent will the European Parliament be able to play a role in this?	0.9367325656994873
What is the role of the scientific committees?	0.9013435547587003
What, also, will be the role of the food authorities which you are about to set up?	1.099591580676047
Finally, will this whole decision-making process be carried out in a transparent, public way?	1.0081490046925063
These are my three questions.	0.23695403903428836
. Yes, Mr President, that is true.	0.9148462522256028
There were many and difficult issues and not always crystal clear, but I will try to answer some questions.	0.7235543248931539
Who will take the decision, who are the decision-makers?	1.2474468373531435
Well, that depends on who the legislators are.	0.6953935361321071
This is part of risk management.	0.3661540177742806
They have to look at, for example, the concerns of people in relation to a special issue, and they have to judge from what is known about the scientific evidence in a certain case.	1.028258544368493
However, it is true that it does not need a big majority of the scientific community to be able to use the precautionary principle.	0.8684550867356727
It can be used on evidence from a minority or where science is incomplete.	0.600989875009049
That is, of course, where you strike a balance between this principle as a political tool and science.	0.6980078701109786
It is not always easy to describe exactly how this process is done, but there is no question of changing the scientific base.	0.8693340928212783
We use the experts to get as much scientific information and facts as possible before we take a decision; and that should also be done in the future.	0.8621875062357849
You have to see this as a tool for risk management.	1.077900239470191
You have to decide whether you want to put people in danger, for example, or if you want to protect the environment; and you have to look at the science that is available.	1.0134165111508529
You have to assess all that and evaluate the science.	0.6428936068904815
Then you decide to take a measure or not, to take action or not.	0.9795060792415656
So, there is no answer to all your questions but this does not change the system of the scientists that we use today or the system of experts that we use today.	0.8075781801319251
Mr President, I have a question concerning an actual, concrete case in which it should be possible to apply the precautionary principle.	1.021092307735241
It is about brominated flame retardants.	0.5815761917390496
It is a fact that these substances are now being discovered. There are increased concentrations of them in both people and the environment.	0.9310387733978845
There are many people who maintain that they entail major risks, while others question how large the risks involved in these substances really are.	0.7191579420444137
Recently, both Sweden and Denmark urged the Commission in the Council of Ministers to take the initiative and ban brominated flame retardants.	0.964222502293311
I am wondering, therefore, if you are preparing such a ban and if it would not fit in very well with your approach to the precautionary principle itself to come up with such an initiative.	0.7948536781423725
. (SV) Mr President, thank you very much, Mr Sjöstedt, for this question.	0.7930559376057776
The issue of brominated flame retardants is an important one.	0.5474404804048529
It was raised quite recently in the Environment Council by a number of ministers who want the Commission to look at what basis there might be for a ban and at what might need to be done.	0.8678008590589951
We are in the process of looking into this question and assessing what knowledge we have today and what it is possible to do.	0.8293961139527772
Allow me to remind you, however, that use of the precautionary principle does not need to be synonymous with there being a total ban.	0.7940111136989543
There may be a series of different measures which can be taken.	0.7911509639544773
It ought not, therefore, to be immediately interpreted as a ban.	0.7158725835695061
Where brominated flame retardants are concerned, there may eventually be a ban, but it is important to say that the precautionary principle permits the whole spectrum of political measures and initiatives to be taken.	0.8278746105640857
This issue is extremely topical.	0.6658038254765045
The Commission is to do its job and give proper attention to the issue before we come back with an assessment of what needs to be done.	0.8869060678040066
You said that the precautionary principle should not be used as a disguised trade barrier.	0.8140042318485539
Is the understanding of this point the same on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean?	0.7515362991445588
I think we are going to have problems particularly with hormone-treated beef and genetically modified crops.	0.6273668664333317
Will the Americans take the same view of this point as we do?	0.7779079924832762
. (SV) Mr President, I am pleased to be able to tell you that, in Montreal, we have just signed a protocol concerning bio-safety.	0.8465591967171593
We succeeded there in agreeing, at an international forum, as to the definition of the precautionary principle.	0.9899718833830055
I consider it to be a breakthrough that we succeeded in concluding this protocol.	0.6907977402660603
I believe it will set the trend for future discussions concerning the precautionary principle.	0.6221402834620995
We are going to be able to use this as an example of how the precautionary principle is to be interpreted.	1.0303617716453741
It is, moreover, also accepted as an important and effective tool.	0.7514298964671042
Mr President, I have two questions. I shall try to be very brief indeed.	1.2333879334736981
The first question concerns the implementation of the precautionary principle.	0.5512624795085924
As I have understood it, there has been a certain lack of clarity in some respects as to how this is to be understood.	1.0628022707619844
Is it the case that a risk assessment is firstly to be carried out, including a cost-benefit analysis?	0.7339609415164149
In that case, I am rather concerned, because the idea was really that a cost-benefit analysis should not be used as a tool for deciding whether the precautionary principle should be introduced. Instead, the precautionary principle should come first.	0.9033075195663658
My second question concerns the burden of proof.	0.4084236838577458
I remember Margot Wallström being introduced as Commissioner in the Committee.	0.4876074515418127
At that time, she was talking about the desire for a reversed burden of proof.	0.5991103003496384
In other words, a product' s manufacturer is to demonstrate whether or not the product is hazardous.	0.7008738132674805
I want to know whether this also applies in the document which the Commission has presented now.	1.1492992887897908
. (SV) Thank you, Mrs Schörling.	0.7278658293389343
These are two important questions, and it is good that I should be given the opportunity to clarify them.	1.0038559572472823
No, one must not begin by carrying out a cost-benefit analysis. Instead, the latter should be based upon an assessment of what it is we know, of what science has to tell us and of how we should view the product concerned in the light of the risks we judge there to exist for the environment or for the health of human beings or animals.	0.8686917995375616
When, on the other hand, the decision has been made to take a certain measure, the one chosen ought to be cost-effective so that there is in fact no resort to measures which are wholly unreasonable given their degree of effectiveness.	0.9489182677307291
It is not, therefore, the case that one must begin with a cost-benefit analysis.	0.8190894248250414
The second question concerns the reversed burden of proof.	0.2943385555138175
It is perfectly correct that we need to apply this in certain cases.	0.7772501600172638
I have used chemical strategy as a good example of an area in which we need to do this.	0.913251966971322
There, however, we are concerned with that particular area, whereas it may be said that the present communication concerning the precautionary principle is horizontal in the sense that it concerns the full range of specific technical areas that are of political concern.	0.916000590056713
Therefore, the issues of the reversed burden of proof and of what the burden of proof is to look like are not especially discussed in this context. Instead, it is a question of political decision-making and of the bases for this.	0.8865184640127741
It is, however, perfectly correct that, when it comes, for example, to chemicals, we must ensure that we obtain a reversed burden of proof.	0.8945456733247362
Mr President, I believe that the precautionary principle needs to be quite radical in order to work, otherwise we shall always be confused by all the different interpretations possible.	0.8617802465248877
I will give an example: a fungicide has been proven to cause babies to be born blind. It is therefore a teratogenic substance.	0.7838678926318059
Very well, it is a fungicide, it kills off mould.	0.8910960192718608
This teratogenicity has been demonstrated by just one English laboratory, perhaps because it is the only one that has carried out tests.	0.8632132087198744
Now, in my opinion, given that this is such a serious risk to health, the precautionary principle lays down that this product should immediately be taken off the market, which New Zealand has done, for example.	0.8750844884077374
So I want to put this question to you. When human health is at stake, or there is the possibility that human health will be seriously affected, should we not perhaps carry out a cost-benefit analysis?	0.9351463639737234
The cost of a baby being born blind is too high; there are no benefits that can compensate for this.	0.7321160665962964
In short, Commissioner, I would therefore like to know whether in this case, the precautionary principle as you understand it, would in any case, require the product to be taken off the market, until such time as another laboratory provides evidence to the contrary.	0.832579959800116
. (SV) Mr President, no one wants more than I do to see a situation in which we are able to apply the precautionary principle in such a way that it is seen as radically protecting people' s health and the environment.	0.876155985073226
Obviously, I cannot adopt a stance on this special case and on the particular product which has been mentioned here, but I shall go directly back and see what I can obtain in the way of information about this particular case.	0.9695873690909357
The truth, of course, is that a great many Member States, and no doubt other nations too, have taken measures to protect their populations' health which amount to using the precautionary principle, even if it has not always been called that.	0.9563692512301303
Naturally, it is not in the first place a question of cost; there can in fact be an enormous cost to society if the decision to take a particular measure is avoided.	1.0369571170761538
Nor must it be a case of sitting and calculating the value of a human life over and against the cost of taking a particular measure.	0.6076815100822935
I think, however, it is quite obvious that when it is eventually time to decide upon a particular step to be taken, it is often the case that there are many different courses of action to choose between.	0.929584097569285
In those circumstances, consideration should be given to what is likely to produce the best result.	0.884854332180027
I cannot forbear telling you about an occasion when the expression cost-effective was used by people whom one cannot perhaps imagine using it, namely when I was on a visit to Africa.	0.5865888859863395
At a hospice for AIDS patients, I met two Irish Catholic nuns who were caring for dying AIDS patients.	0.4713025073678016
They were the first to say that, each day, they must think about doing what is most cost-effective because resources had to suffice for their poor patients there. We must be very careful about how we use resources.	0.944406443251714
I believe we can learn something from this.	0.8361532432087989
We must, of course, always ensure that we use our resources in the most effective manner and in such a way that they provide the broadest possible help.	0.7861498304582308
As is also explained in the present communication, it is not therefore correct that one must first begin with some sort of cost-benefit analysis.	0.7882121910529916
Consideration should be given to what science is offering in the way of knowledge, and this should be used as an important political tool for protecting the environment and people' s health.	1.030255164569923
Mr President, it is a rare honour to be given a second opportunity to ask questions!	1.0180663010518443
Commissioner, I would like to come back again to my first question, when I asked about the other Commissioners, for it may have sounded as though I was in jest.	1.009470966301915
Indeed you responded in kind, as I knew you would do.	0.752077091254104
I would like to draw your attention to something Mr Goodwill asked, that is to the connections we make between the precautionary principle and the world beyond the European Union.	0.7945720287888597
I have good reason for asking this.	0.4136823021794378
As you rightly said, the precautionary principle is needed in precisely those areas where, as yet, there is no scientific evidence.	0.9071918835703464
How can we ensure that we will not be laying ourselves open to attack at any time, for example by our partners in the USA, on account of the bio safety protocol not being adequate to their purposes?	0.9242495600340721
How can we be sure that those of your colleagues responsible for industrial policy and foreign trade policy, will not, as they did on the last few occasions with your predecessors, keep pulling the carpet from underneath you?	0.8763142676282093
That is exactly what it is all about, otherwise we might as well not bother talking about the precautionary principle here, Commissioner!	0.9120000966248384
Mr President, I think it is extremely important to point to the present communication' s guidelines for using the precautionary principle as a way of repudiating assertions to the effect that we always want to use the principle for protectionist reasons.	0.9109222395252623
I am certain that we are going to have more conflicts, for example with the United States.	0.9917462486798241
We should not be so naïve as to think otherwise.	0.7584176567717137
Ever since we signed this protocol in Montreal, we nonetheless have international recognition and a common definition written into a protocol dealing with the environment, health and trade.	0.6355951251998548
This constitutes a good example, therefore.	0.9548957351655764
We should be in no doubt that conflicts may arise in the future too, but we can now show that we do not use the precautionary principle arbitrarily.	1.0493026494128723
We now have a number of guidelines for using the precautionary principle, and we have increased support among our respective peoples for using it, something which is clearly established in the present communication.	0.8535390397723512
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6002529528362665
The focus on the political precautionary principle means that we have being discussing it for almost two hours and this topic is now being viewed, so to speak, as more than an ordinary aspect of administration, even though, as we have been able to establish from the interventions, questions and replies, it is a topic which we believe to be of considerable importance.	0.8804390939909018
The debate is closed.	0.04146649521247962
Intergovernmental Conference	-0.0
The next item is the report (A5-0018/2000) by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference [14094/1999 - C5-0341/1999 - 1999/0825(CNS)].	0.45351197139522714
Mr President, I will begin by thanking the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission for all our recent very useful contacts.	1.09958538912381
Let me also once more thank my co-rapporteur Mr Leinen for our excellent collaboration.	0.4475512902819257
The Intergovernmental Conference that is about to begin is important, both in a general sense and more particularly in view of the imminent enlargement.	0.7890656697756582
The work of the Conference will determine the structure and method based on which Europe will be functioning in the twentieth century.	0.6828831038443467
For the European Union of the future to be able to function more effectively, more democratically and with complete transparency, clearly what we need is an extensive and in-depth reform of the institutions and the way they work.	1.0140073612353075
The first and substantive prerequisite for achieving that reform is the agenda based on which the Intergovernmental Conference is to begin its work.	0.772772050030415
From the decisions made at the Helsinki Summit, it emerges that the agenda agreed there is unsatisfactory and does not guarantee the essential and substantive changes required for creating a more functional Europe, one that is more effective, more democratic and more transparent.	0.825165562665597
This is because the Helsinki agenda is limited to consideration only of the three issues that relate in a fragmentary way to the structure and operation of just two of the European Union' s institutional bodies.	0.7433356760167621
I will not repeat which ones, because everyone knows.	0.8297196882923322
My conclusion is justified on the one hand by the constant and sometimes very insistent demands of the peoples of Europe and on the other hand by the huge scale of the great enterprise in which the European Union is already involved, namely enlargement.	0.923986016327756
Granted this, the new Intergovernmental Conference must not fail to include in its agenda issues which, properly addressed, would ensure the correct operation of all and not just some of the European Union' s institutions.	0.8731272933323949
Just as it also must not fail to include everyday issues which, for that very reason, are highly visible to the European public.	0.9288338890895493
In its numerous debates and its reports so far the European Parliament has openly supported the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.6140648913895258
At the same time, however, I am asking for it to include issues that improve and complement the reform, I repeat, of all the institutional bodies as well as issues that are of direct concern and interest to the European public such as health, energy, culture, transport and even tourism.	0.9404705824776495
Whether or not the agenda will ultimately be widened is still the subject of debate and on this point I would like to extol the political conduct of the Portuguese Presidency, which has repeatedly made a commitment to the European Parliament to make the necessary efforts towards that end.	0.9570526382768697
All the same, whether or not more issues will be considered must in no way diminish the importance attributed by every Member State to the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.6823717455600955
This is because the institutional framework within which Europe will operate in the future is a foundation of European integration and is therefore a matter of the greatest national importance for every one of the Union' s Member States.	0.9572225363804391
In light of what I have said, I ask Parliament to approve the opinion which Mr Leinen and I have put before you, so that on 14 February, the work of the Intergovernmental Conference can begin and our two representatives, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, can proceed with the difficult task that awaits them with the European Parliament' s backing.	0.8820140906053844
The same applies to the Commission and I would again like to thank Commissioner Barnier for his collaboration with the European Parliament and for the very constructive proposals he put before us.	1.0969465478649825
Mr President, the Group of the European People' s Party was not satisfied with the conclusions of the European Council in Helsinki.	0.9665914087090463
It seemed to us that the agenda lacked content, because our group was thinking in terms of the Treaty and, specifically, the protocol on the Union' s institutions.	0.961389516517142
In Helsinki, the governments approved the idea that, as long as the European Union consists of fewer than 21 States, a minimal reform would be sufficient. With more than 21, a deeper reform would become necessary.	0.9430048436413068
The European Council in Helsinki itself approved enlargement involving 13 new Member States.	0.539325880640343
It is therefore inconsistent to open accession negotiations with 13 countries while contemplating a minimal reform.	0.536512166311005
We are therefore thinking in terms of the Treaty and we want the agenda of the next Intergovernmental Conference to allow for a deeper reform of the Union.	1.1193566314229448
Having said this, Mr President, this Parliament is holding this debate today because we did not want to delay the start of the Conference.	0.9550318620252745
In theory, we could have done so.	1.0309741966699737
We could have voted on the 17th of this month and the Conference would not have been able to start on the 14th.	0.7606167853772602
However, we did not want to do this because we wish to send a clear political signal to the governments and the candidate countries that we want this reform to take place, precisely in order to facilitate enlargement.	1.0255257061294532
Mr President, I am very happy to be able to say this to the Portuguese Presidency because it has earned great respect in this Assembly.	0.8797919591951182
The Portuguese Presidency shares many of this Parliament' s aspirations and has committed itself to doing everything it can to ensure that the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference is widened to include other essential issues.	0.6597388931956099
Mr President, I would like to point out that this aspiration on the part of the European Parliament is not an aspiration to gain benefits for the European Parliament itself.	1.0275345624247623
However, the European Parliament will be reinforced politically by the Treaty resulting from this Intergovernmental Conference. This is for one very simple reason: according to the agreements made in Helsinki, this Intergovernmental Conference will lead to issues, which are currently decided unanimously, being decided by a qualified majority.	0.996185060731251
Therefore, the number of issues decided by a qualified majority will increase.	0.6782168851547098
It is already established within the Community acquis that those legislative issues which are decided by a qualified majority are also subject to codecision with Parliament.	0.6458209270359354
Therefore, since the qualified majority will be extended, there will also be more codecision with Parliament.	0.8800012252222416
However, this Parliament would not be fulfilling its role as a supranational European institution if it did not consider the political design of the Union.	0.8260507368008911
That it is what we are doing.	1.0055082152350878
We believe that, in the political design of the Union, other issues need to be dealt with.	0.8675697832404226
These include, amongst others, the incorporation into the Treaty of security and defence issues, which have made much progress recently, but which must be incorporated into the Treaty.	1.184864389149252
Of course there is also the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and work began on its wording yesterday, which I believe has started very positively.	0.9307664208327716
We are going to work seriously to ensure that the Europeans come to see being European as an advantage and that European citizens have certain fundamental rights which are connected to the Union' s institutions.	0.6812250537259106
Therefore, Mr President, our proposals, which we will specify in another report, together with the proposals of the Commission, which has produced an excellent document - and I am happy to be able to say this here to Mr Barnier - are going to be used as conference documents.	1.047739291110364
We will talk about this on another day.	0.5094828315747435
Today we must give the green light to this conference, and, for its part, the Group of the European People' s Party, Mr President, is ready to give that green light.	0.8668080144661553
Mr President, for the Socialist Group I can say we will be supporting the draft opinion put forward by the rapporteurs on behalf of the Constitutional Affairs Committee.	0.951410933917233
We are giving a positive opinion on the convening of the IGC precisely because we have been impressed by the attitude of the Portuguese Presidency which has taken on board our request that the agenda of the IGC be widened.	0.821172286448367
The Amsterdam leftovers is not a very good term, because they are very important subjects in themselves.	1.046695152026397
Let us call them the first three subjects of the IGC.	0.6537567954404375
These first three subjects are very important but they are subjects which were explored in detail by our Member States during the last IGC.	0.6153915934647229
They did not quite reach a conclusion on them but they certainly do not need nine months of further study.	0.5827422765448271
They need a political deal.	0.4161460693282379
It is more a question of nine minutes, perhaps nine hours if it is difficult, locked away together in a room to reach a solution on these subjects, not nine months.	0.7949161675273552
In those circumstances it would be silly not to widen the agenda.	0.5837249284034783
There are other issues that should fruitfully be looked at, especially before such a large widening of the Union to so many new countries.	0.8639712105894034
Nobody is asking for a Christmas tree.	0.40330376024569337
Nobody is asking for an IGC of the Maastricht style with a hundred or more subjects being debated.	0.39419877439652273
However, there are six, seven, eight, nine perhaps, subjects which it would be very appropriate and useful to address.	0.7486550474782047
There is time.	0.15839672964065196
Remember the IGC that led to the Single European Act.	0.6313208509574674
It lasted only five months.	0.13979217662888513
The IGC that led to the enormous Maastricht Treaty lasted a year.	0.38004546615852064
Only the Amsterdam Treaty lasted a year and a half and that was because everyone knew you had to wait for the results of the British election if you were going to have any outcome from that IGC so that was a different reason.	0.7609267212954612
A year is ample time to address a large number of issues and it should certainly be enough to address the few crucial points that we wish to be added to the agenda.	0.7708369924697878
I am pleased to see that the Commission shares our view.	0.960448332746683
The Commission has just published its opinion and it has done exactly what Parliament asked of it - to bring forward a comprehensive proposal complete with actual draft treaty articles.	0.8235226087118578
I thank the Commission for doing that even if, of course, I do not agree with everything the Commission said.	0.8709424979526293
I think there are some gaps in what they have put forward.	0.8208478526397898
Nonetheless the Commission has provided a service and I pay tribute to Commissioner Barnier who is here with us today for doing that.	0.6638849885626866
They have laid out for the public to see some of the crucial issues that we are going to have to address in this IGC.	0.9039371956675292
That is all to the good.	0.7087924244282229
The Parliament, the Council presidency and the Commission are pulling in the same direction for a wider agenda.	1.2154821110989809
I wish you every success, President of the Council, in making sure that the European Council agrees to this agenda and that on Valentine' s Day when you start off the IGC it will be under good auspices and you will bring it to a good conclusion, also when the French Presidency takes over, by the end of this year.	0.9305447520299918
We should no longer be worried that the agenda for the IGC will be restricted.	0.766746859954749
That is one of the political conclusions that we must draw from the grave decision of 14 Member States yesterday virtually to freeze relations with a partner.	0.6487368031629651
It makes it impossible for those same Member States, at the IGC, to fail to give operational meaning to the protection and advancement of fundamental rights.	0.7321539623719985
It is already strange within the convention that is drafting the charter to see representatives of some Member States, especially Britain and France, seeking to argue that a mandatory charter would somehow be an infringement of national sovereignty.	0.6389428647953355
It is vital that the IGC prepares the way to accept the installation of a fundamental rights regime within the Treaty.	0.7484494806521993
One part of this is to improve the access of the citizen to the Court.	1.0796615719389282
Another is for the Union itself to sign up to the European Convention.	1.1235088599817948
Another is clearly for national parliaments and national political parties to find a reinforced role that they can play inside European Union affairs and to share the shouldering of responsibility to build European parliamentary democracy.	0.6404922502455439
My group strongly welcomes the IGC and will be contributing to this Treaty reform process to the maximum possible extent.	0.5955012309645872
Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance believes that the European Parliament' s decision to rush headlong into giving its opinion on the Intergovernmental Conference undermines the political significance of the request for talks with the Council, and in the end, makes it rather irrelevant.	0.8336257327028362
We would have preferred to have had greater clarification of the agenda and more guarantees on the method before giving our opinion, and frankly, we did not appreciate the discourtesy the Portuguese Presidency showed towards the European Parliament by scheduling the start of the Intergovernmental Conference for Saint Valentine' s day, the first day of the Strasbourg part-session.	0.8421127243084028
Moreover, given that this opinion is quite important, we can still vote for it, and indeed, the majority of our group will be voting for it.	1.231763303635959
I nevertheless wish to stress the fact that it is quite distressing to see the lack of real interest in this reform.	0.9432257254993374
The events in Austria make it crystal clear that we need a body or structure for democracy in Europe and we need to establish principles which provide bases all the Member States.	0.7863620966951279
It is also distressing to think that the initiative taken against Austria is actually the result of an agreement between governments and that, in any case, the European Union and its institutions would not have had the means or the consensus to allow them to act, and to prevent and rectify the course of events.	1.0029216869998139
We must take action on this at the Intergovernmental Conference, and I firmly hope that this opinion, that was given reluctantly, will not mean that the European Parliament ceases to exert pressure on the Council and the Member States to make sure that this Intergovernmental Conference is not merely a technical exercise, but rouses the passions that we saw a few hours ago in Parliament.	1.083240327576287
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, to my mind, it cannot be said often or loud enough that what the Council has adopted in the way of an agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference is completely unacceptable politically and I would add that I consider it to be nothing short of disgraceful.	0.900760489916033
After all, we find ourselves in a situation of historic importance, that is to say, we are negotiating or are on the point of taking up negotiations with 12 States, and together we have reached a stage at which closer European integration may be a reality in the not too distant future.	0.8168729713633097
How, though, is the Union to be enlarged if we do not do the job properly now, i.e. before enlargement takes place?	0.8284598090326303
That is why we as a group are in favour of the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.6916273550497165
We consider it to be indispensable and urgently needed and hope that it actually comes up with the goods that will enable us to carry out enlargement of the European Union in the not too distant future.	0.7285886269084482
My group, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, noted with satisfaction that the Council Presidency is far from happy with the current state of affairs.	0.7031024345628198
You can therefore rest assured that the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is committed to seeing that the Union gets on with the tasks in hand.	0.5543216445462645
What we are talking about is nothing more and nothing less than the future of Europe, and, in particular, a Europe that the citizens truly regard as being theirs, because they are instrumental in shaping it and because the cares and concerns, the problems and issues they face on a daily basis are also taken seriously by politicians.	0.9009180373345124
The politics of closed doors and private discussions; all that must be consigned to the past once and for all.	0.5428600723012194
That is why we need transparency.	0.8275933778330354
I believe it falls to you, as President-in-Office of the Council, to see to it that the train does not keep rolling on as before, leaving the people behind on the platforms as if they were ignorant as to the content of the treaties.	0.7577473564140804
We believe it is imperative not just to make every available effort to provide the citizens with comprehensive information on how the Intergovernmental Conference is going, and its outcome, rather they must be directly involved in the overall reform process to a far greater extent.	0.9572489296967437
We also take the view that the political decision-makers must at long last change the habit of a life-time and ask the citizens in referenda, once the Intergovernmental Conference is over, whether or not they go along with the way in which Europe is to continue to develop in the future.	0.9042481827832892
In this way, Europe would truly belong to the citizens and the Union would acquire an entirely new quality of democratic legitimacy.	0.8070698582330736
There is another central issue relating to democracy that I would like to make clear reference to.	0.7390916299807821
As a member of the convention that has now taken up its work on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, I wish to make the following point clear: neither my group nor I are content with making a solemn announcement about the Charter.	0.7941465561388487
After all, what will the citizens say if we make a solemn announcement about rights to them but they are unable to take legal action in respect of these rights as individuals?	0.6500692838178418
No, to my mind this would only serve to deepen the credibility crisis facing the Union.	0.653525313522846
The poor turnout at the European elections really should have been warning enough for everyone.	0.6424659376914544
What we need are visible rights for each and every citizen; the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding for all the citizens of the Union.	0.8222543917354651
Together we should work towards this goal in the interests of the citizens, and what I expect to come out of the Intergovernmental Conference is that the relevant Cologne decision will be revised here at the end of the year.	0.9287605417144418
Of course, we are also talking about effectiveness of decisions and functioning institutions in a Union of 27 plus Member States.	0.7239293585764551
We will not achieve this just by undertaking a mini reform, as the Council has resolved to do, and that is why all institutions must come under scrutiny.	1.0249075701992665
We need bold change and, at the same time, we must take care to give the greatest possible attention to equal rights for the major and small States.	0.8535020219391743
This is something I would stress, particularly with my being an MEP for one of the major Member States.	1.0818869024768412
I would like to thank the Commission for the proposals they have put forward and I am certain that comprehensive discussions with the citizens will ensue here in the European Parliament, on all the issues you have raised.	0.9387053107709781
There is one final issue I would like to raise.	0.6973712422580128
Parliament' s opinion expressly demands amendments to the Treaty in the area of economic policy.	0.847480725856303
It is indeed the case that globalisation of national economies, but above all the introduction of the euro and the associated stability pact have led to a situation where we need to do more than analyse decision-making processes.	0.9250493277904617
What we need most of all is to have the courage to undertake a critical examination of the Union' s policies to date.	0.9100322373506444
It is all about creating a socially just Europe.	0.5960175065357681
A socially just Europe is still highly topical, for what we need to do as a matter of priority is place the fight against mass unemployment and poverty firmly at the centre of the Union' s policies.	0.8278441100277818
Hence, to my mind, that includes having the courage to amend Article 4 of the EC Treaty, which defines the Union in traditional neoliberal style as an open market economy with free competition. The same applies to Article 105, in my view, for the European Central Bank must at last be given the political task as enshrined in the Treaty, of using its monetary policy to promote sustained growth and employment.	0.9047068140519632
Mr President, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group considers that the agenda for the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, as set by the Helsinki Council, i.e. focussing strictly on the issue of decision making in an enlarged Europe, must be adhered to.	0.8452820297148009
It must be adhered to in the interests of the fast, effective work of the conference, prior to enlargement.	0.7233778262553706
This is why we cannot subscribe to either the opinion of the European Parliament or indeed to that of the Commission, which both wish to widen this agenda far too much and, what is more, widen it in the wrong direction, i.e. moving towards centralisation and an ever tighter European system.	0.8187779761015646
Our group has therefore tabled a raft of amendments which, when taken together, form a real alternative resolution.	0.7014332017036429
In them we say that the forthcoming IGC must look into a decision-making system that pays greater attention to national sovereignty.	0.7766931753100031
We deplore the fact that the Commission, in its opinion of 26 January, limits itself to following the routine path of a standardised Europe enlarging towards the East, a centralised superstate operating on the basis of majority decisions.	0.7510277309386175
The federalists imagine that they are thereby going to create unity through constraint, but this is a totally superficial concept.	0.792587314180311
Quite the opposite, in an enlarged Europe, Mr President, the standardisation imposed by the improper use of majority decisions can lead only to the whole thing exploding.	0.8649568160037137
Furthermore, the centralised European system, as we can see it developing today and as we can foresee it by extrapolation, erodes nations and, in eroding nations, erodes the national patriotism which forms the basis of our will to defend ourselves.	0.9141259980531535
The Europe which results from this is not stronger but weaker, as it no longer knows what it is or what it is defending.	0.8424413487522884
This is why we have always said that enlargement was possible only if the diversity and freedom of the peoples of Europe was clearly recognised, i.e. by adopting flexibility founded upon the respect of national sovereignty.	0.8102486926704039
We are delighted today to see the progress this idea has enjoyed in certain circles, one which are still, unfortunately, outside the European Parliament and the Commission.	0.8910019696133702
A flexible Europe, is a Europe which respects its national democracies, which relies on the support of its nations, its national patriotisms, instead of continually persecuting them.	0.8434826877642363
It is this that gives us the determination to defend ourselves against external threats, not the constraining, convoluted decision making procedures which the Commission thought it could propose at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.	0.7382113411834746
Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Italian Radicals and I would like to say to the President of the Council that he has seen what Parliament' s opinion is.	1.1099180350898294
It is no coincidence that the last intervention is the only one that was completely opposed to further European integration. I say this without being the slightest bit ironical about the highly respectable position of Mr Berthu and his group, but it is no coincidence that the European Council' s decision is supported by those who are, after all, in Parliament because - and this is a highly respectable position - they are fighting against further integration.	0.9891372587657913
This is the message that Parliament is sending to the Council.	1.036441855810543
I hope that the Portuguese Presidency - and I add my compliments to those already offered - can convey Parliament' s message and convey the result of our mediation work on Saint Valentine' s day. In any case, tomorrow we shall vote against the IGC agenda.	0.844101314104408
This message must be very clear; this is how we explain the way we shall vote tomorrow.	0.9337033987962539
We shall give an opinion - which is technically and legally necessary - on convening the IGC on 14 February, but we shall give an unfavourable opinion of its content.	0.8730032965877486
Just consider the facts: we looked at Austria a while ago, but we can also look at the stock markets, Mr President: given that the euro, that great undertaking, has fallen 16% against the dollar in a year, then perhaps, I will not say a government, but a good head of a family should ask himself whether one can conceivably tell the citizens that the only subjects open to negotiation are the number of Commissioners or similar issues.	0.9589232672575604
There is clearly a more ambitious goal.	0.6515976513420487
We Radicals have tabled amendments which we are submitting to the House in order to consolidate this text, and for example, to request - just for the sake of mentioning Articles 6 and 7 - that the very minimum be done, i.e., that the European Parliament should also be involved in drawing up the European Constitution and that a proposal be made for the European Parliament to adopt the amendments to the Treaty.	1.0487453603242836
We know that there are other topics: for example, many Members have subscribed, along with us, to the issue of the seat of the institutions, an issue that we believe should be considered at least at IGC level.	0.946507560430465
In conclusion, I hope that the message that we give tomorrow will be strong and wide-ranging for once, so that thanks also to the efforts of the Portuguese Presidency, this agenda will be revised.	0.9086317184257733
Otherwise, the challenge really would be lost, not just for the present but also for many years to come.	1.019955168565232
Mr President, the President of the Commission was not being quite honest when he talked last week about the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.8116360967233264
He said that there would always be unanimity on social questions but, in the Commission' s draft, plans are quite explicitly being made for majority decision-making on issues relating to social security and on taxes connected with the internal market. This means that it will be possible for major parts of the social systems in the Member States to be changed by a majority in Brussels, even if a unanimous French National Assembly, a British House of Commons and a Dutch Lower House should be against this.	0.912755581896654
And, in this regard, you are going to the heart of democracy as it relates to distribution policy and people' s social conditions, which are what voters wish to influence when they go to the polls.	0.8825305555794851
These are matters which we ourselves shall no longer be able to decide upon as voters and no longer be able to change on election day.	0.6498721467557337
Brussels knows best.	0.07098286177117427
Mr Prodi also announced greater transparency, but his draft regulation signals a clear backward step, and that is not only my assessment, but also that of the European Ombudsman.	1.113887641671405
Today, the Commission is obliged, on a case-by-case basis, to weigh considerations of confidentiality against people' s demands for, and expectation of, transparency and, if the Commission' s regulation is adopted, the Commission will be entitled to lock away whole categories of documents without having to give them specific consideration.	0.9877926221555885
There is also the desire to create a legal entitlement to confidentiality and to lock away documents of a kind which are at present publicly available in a range of Member States.	0.7357703920715384
Under the banner of "progress towards transparency" , a range of documents is being locked away from the general public.	0.6383412085037259
It is, of course, thoroughly Orwellian.	0.3623889431300553
I want to ask Mr Prodi never more to comment on a proposal here in the House which is not, at the same time, available for critical scrutiny by the public.	0.8426521289994695
Mr Prodi secured positive comments for a proposal which would otherwise have been met with criticism, for the new draft regulation presents as progress the fact that it will now be possible to grant right of access to documents in the Commission' s possession. There follows, however, a long, long list of exceptions, and there is legal entitlement to confidentiality in regard to those exceptions.	0.8207428243513135
The French text contains the word "refuse" and the English text the word "shall" , which means that the Commission is to keep secret such information as is today available to the public, for example in my own country.	0.9286489867216126
In addition, we have a flexible clause concerning the efficiency of the negotiations and of the institutions, which may be used for any purposes whatsoever. It is therefore ...	1.0875056967335162
(The President cut the speaker off)	0.07650392215616267
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Portuguese Council Presidency' s account has given me the distinct impression that we are approaching this Intergovernmental Conference with well-considered ideas and a high degree of openness.	0.6212839461541698
We as a European Parliament will use these opportunities to see that our issues are given the attention they deserve.	0.8174406169193189
The preparations the Commission has made so far are on the right track, although they do not go far enough if the European Parliament' s motions are anything to go by.	0.8486958427218092
There is more to be said on that score.	0.794957437465629
It is crucially important for this Intergovernmental Conference to score a hat trick; that of the power to act, democratic legitimacy and transparency.	0.7459055890939018
In the end, it is only by having these three things in place that we will be able to achieve acceptance amongst the citizens.	0.7712055358320498
At the same time of course, we need to create the power to act in order to facilitate the enlargement of the European Union.	1.0235540740199003
If we have been having a different debate here in this Chamber today then that only goes to show how important this is.	0.7965553698878849
The European Union must also have the power to act in the event of a government electing to impose a total blockade.	0.934602271584125
This is an important sign that majority voting is a crucial pre-requisite to the European Union' s being able to function come what may.	0.707769528377428
This is particularly important where enlargement is concerned, and legislation and in relation to treaties, which entail changes being made to legislation.	0.8309438058200471
Of course we also want to extend the European Parliament' s corresponding powers in this area.	0.7747164114512194
In addition, we as a European Parliament are going to have to take action in relation to Economic and Monetary Union, for there is a lack of supervision in this area.	1.1296306816199781
The Finance Ministers behave as if they were in an intergovernmental meeting, when in the Ecofin Council and in the Euro 11 Council, which is an unacceptable way to go on.	0.9781805456235477
Unlike Mrs Kaufmann, I am not in favour of extending supervision over the European Central Bank as I am an advocate of independence for the European Central Bank.	0.7521198546785343
However, there must be an appropriate level of supervision on the political side.	0.968148599285352
Furthermore, the tripartite relationship of Commission, Council and Parliament must be restored to the sphere of foreign and security policy, where hitherto the Council was in sole charge far more than should have been the case, especially in relation to the crudely fashioned crisis management measures, for which the Commission alone has responsibility.	0.8539571228067071
The overall plan failed to do justice to any of this.	0.4727636049860154
We must examine whether any changes are needed to this end which would fall within the scope of the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.594292826679214
The Portuguese Presidency has agreed to initiate deliberations on this matter, perhaps to extend the mandate.	0.8054460963395305
There is another point I would just like to draw your attention to.	0.6437724548749987
The debates we are having these days, on a certain European country' s government, for example, show, do they not, that we must place the spiritual, moral, constitutional, community and common welfare-orientated leanings of the European Union on a firm footing, and that legally binding fundamental rights must also be incorporated into the Treaty for the same reason, as this will be a crucial stabilising factor.	1.0280340125269247
I would urge those who are still very hesitant in this respect to consider whether now is not the time to make this connection and perhaps pluck up the courage we need to make suitable progress in matters of fundamental rights.	0.9447625190213712
The European Union needs few, if any, new instruments, and it does not need any new competences.	1.1449115150826346
What it does need are instruments that will enable it to put its competences into practice.	0.589888834203825
For this reason, we must ensure that the instruments have the effect of enabling us to carry out, on behalf of the citizens, the tasks we have already formally been set in the Treaty.	0.8803409267058985
In my view, that is the most important issue this Intergovernmental Conference has to concentrate its energies on.	0.9120487240298468
If we succeed in making progress here, then we will also be ready for the historic task of enlarging the European Union.	0.7682232373272078
This is the crux of the matter.	0.5902234316075766
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am confident that this will be tackled in a suitably positive manner under your tutelage.	0.6044884546905991
, chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. (IT) Mr President-in-Office, on listening to the various interventions, you have understood that in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and also among the leaders of Parliament' s political groups, the decision prevailed - although not without some disagreement - to put our faith in the Portuguese Presidency, instead of creating more difficulties by postponing the start of the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.8713123434547798
I can assure you that it was not easy to achieve this, last week in the Committee I chair, but we eventually decided to back the Portuguese Presidency and we would like to win this wager.	1.022415232965314
You spoke to us about the start of your tour around the various capital cities and told us about the difficulties that some governments have in reaching a consensus in their own countries, and therefore in their parliaments.	0.8067828014168703
I would like you to bear in mind that yesterday we had a very worthwhile day of discussions and dialogue with the representatives of the 15 national parliaments, which were represented by competent and exacting delegations.	0.829746062198362
The aim was not to draw conclusions - it was impossible to draw any - but the debate was certainly very encouraging.	1.082773945944996
We need to be careful and be sure that national governments try to convince their respective parliaments to ratify solutions that correspond to the Union' s requirements for growth and that they do not hide behind supposed resistance put up by the parliaments to avoid signing appropriate conclusions at the Intergovernmental Conference table.	0.6374078826457905
However, we shall intensify our collaboration and our dialogue with the national parliaments for the entire duration of the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.8404415909796268
Yesterday, we also discussed the Commission, represented by Commissioner Barnier, who gave its opinion.	0.8845778889729294
This effort was appreciated, even if different views were later expressed as regards the proposals, and moreover, Mr President-in-Office, you also expressed different views.	0.7888193104480845
Nevertheless, we must stress that many people are aware, as they were yesterday too, of the risk that enlargement could compromise the original plan for the construction of a political Europe, a risk that was, moreover, indicated in an interview that surely escaped no one' s attention, owing to the authority of the person being interviewed - Jacques Delors.	0.8738912176631419
We must, therefore, ensure that at the Intergovernmental Conference we discuss how to consolidate the democratic bases of the Union and how to strengthen - and this has been discussed in the House even today, with regard to the situation in Austria - the system of principles, values and rights underpinning the Union and the role of the political institutions of the Union, with regard, among other things, to running the economy.	0.9884129341424678
We are counting on the Portuguese Presidency, we are counting on ourselves and we are counting on the Commission so that we can hold constructive and decisive debates on all of this at the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.8601766071483331
Mr President, only a strengthened Europe can cope with enlargement.	0.6803347282695541
Only a strengthened Europe is immune to political opportunists who exploit dissatisfaction.	0.2884023088495928
That is why sweeping reforms are necessary and, hence, a widened IGC agenda.	0.8221316475526922
The Finnish Presidency only listened to minimalist governments and, unfortunately, turned a deaf ear to this Parliament.	0.5345132731028855
Portugal should not take a leaf out its predecessor' s book.	0.35607785025103456
It is of the utmost importance that the European Parliament and the Commission join forces for this IGC.	0.9773945055175747
In many ways, they share the same interests and the same insights.	0.9404099114734723
An essential component of this joint effort should, in any case, be this Parliament' s right of assent to the forthcoming changes to the Treaty.	0.8205939683880904
Of all priorities, this one is the most pressing.	1.0785730578063242
What is the Commission' s verdict on this?	0.6652789747994782
It also means that our Parliament President and the two representatives should be able to take part on an equal political footing and, therefore, not only within the working party, but also at the same political level as the Commission.	1.00982171777538
There is no reason whatsoever why representatives directly elected by citizens should be involved in talks at a lower level than the Commission.	0.6169315808849546
Not only do we owe the sweeping reforms to the new Member States, but we owe them to ourselves.	0.8318871669306204
If we allow Europe to be watered down as a result of enlargement, we will drown in our own political quagmire.	0.8570667761284132
Mr President, there are days when I really cannot understand this Parliament. It seems to take a masochistic pleasure in self-mutilation.	0.9543201559786522
After having restricted, on its own initiative, its participation in the IGC to two minor seats, Parliament is now giving up the right to add to the agenda for this IGC.	1.0032583931209835
The fact is, whether through weakness or foolishness - nothing to be proud of either way, you will admit - in rushing to give its opinion, Parliament is giving up the only lever which the Treaty accords it, i.e. demanding a complete IGC agenda as a prerequisite before declaring its opinion.	0.8122304582881772
Why do we have to vote on this opinion tomorrow, 3 February, as a matter of urgency, when we could wait, in a position of strength, until the opening of the Strasbourg part-session on 14 February, and thus force an agenda that is complete, and therefore consistent, on the Council.	1.0733339816714265
A good dose of hypocrisy is needed to overlook our weakness today.	0.4385398326600123
Hypocrisy to be regretted bitterly, in our resolution, that the agenda for the IGC is not equal to the issues, since in our haste, with blameworthy naivety, we are stopping ourselves forcing through this more ambitious agenda.	0.9894187412434706
If there is a democratic deficit at the end of this IGC, then I say that the political groups which so wanted this haste will be accountable for this.	0.9619039211837744
Whether we want it or not, since Parliament itself is going to extinguish the only spotlight capable of shedding a little light on the debates, the venue for decisions is now going to move to the 15 Member States of the Union.	0.6579408107903124
I therefore invite the Members of Parliament who form the great majority, those who last November ruled that the future of Europe was deserving of debates that went far wider than the Amsterdam leftovers, to take up their pilgrims' staffs and go and convince their own governments that this IGC must be extended, since this is permitted according to the resolution of the Helsinki Council.	0.8102904378328141
Because of the situation in Austria, this is a dark day for Europe.	0.9394215951472238
It makes us realise that the victory of democracy is never definitive, and that we have to work to convince and keep on convincing.	0.983317153630733
In order to assert our fundamental values, they need to be laid down in writing, as a matter of urgency, and, beyond this IGC, I believe we owe Europe a constitution.	0.9633475863932814
Mr President, the draft resolution we are now discussing requires, precisely as before, that the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference should have a broad agenda involving radical reforms of the institutions.	1.0207779966317825
The forthcoming enlargement of the Union is used as an argument for this.	0.8829630528590589
I am convinced that this is an error of judgement.	0.8708212319405138
A federal and centralist EU which intervenes more and more in the government of the Member States is in actual fact less well placed for enlargement.	0.6388729082398259
A flexible EU which concentrates on fewer but important areas and which respects national differences and national democracy has a better chance of embracing a significantly greater number of countries.	0.4272358805699606
Paragraph D of the draft resolution requires a more coordinated and more open economic policy at EU level.	0.5969291586793117
It is not, however, possible to talk about this without at the same time talking about monetary union.	0.702411230782997
This text says nothing about the major democratic and political problems involving monetary union and the European Central Bank. This is untenable.	0.8039626914123095
If there is a desire to make the EU more democratic, the whole construction of EMU must be reconsidered.	0.9236887844483266
The Central Bank must be placed under political control so that the direction to be taken by monetary policy may be governed by political objectives such as high employment and prosperity. Public control of the Central Bank must be improved if this is to become possible.	0.8415159648543736
The rigid and unsuccessful monetarism of the Stability Pact must be re-examined and discarded so that we might have a uniform policy which has prosperity as its primary objective.	0.5930556836665961
Article 56 of the Treaty, prohibiting currency speculation or any interference in the free movement of capital, must be removed so that damaging currency speculation may be checked by means of political control.	0.5979308227225303
In the majority of EU countries, there are now governments dominated by social democrats.	0.7452309424993996
It is remarkable that, now they have the opportunity to do so, none of them is demanding any change in the direction taken by monetary union.	0.7723707558232381
It also, of course, damages credibility when it is stated that monetary union could constitute a counterbalance to globalised capital.	0.47257413559738076
The resolution requires the European Parliament to have increased influence over the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.8765644685848516
It is, however, important to emphasise that the Intergovernmental Conference is and will remain a conference of the Member States.	0.7499809687496183
It is the Member States' parliaments, or people voting in referenda, who are to direct the development of the Treaty.	1.056666041134171
It is therefore out of the question that the European Parliament should be given any formal influence over the negotiation process or over ratification.	0.9369275057738905
Mr President, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has proposed an essentially positive text, which I shall vote for, even if I personally had proposed a lot of amendments to broaden it.	0.9460715890336289
Nevertheless, the events of the last few days show that all those who had made basic criticisms of the way enlargement and the revision of the Treaties have been planned were right.	0.9784458232039035
The Union cannot be enlarged to 28 without addressing the matter of whether Europe has certain joint principles and values, whether it comes down to an economic free trade area, or whether, on the other hand, it has a greater ambition: the desire to be a supranational union, in ways that have yet to be defined, that wants to blaze a trail for civilisation and democracy in the world.	0.9115467990109165
This is what is and was meant by the call for a European Constitution.	0.9589659197161818
The amendment of the Treaties was, however, limited to a review of some internal rules, which was necessary and important, but did not answer the fundamental question: what is Europe, what are its common principles and therefore, its objectives and limitations?	1.025599588713038
However, politics exacts its revenge, and having been thrown out of the window by a debate on a limited agenda, it comes back in, as a matter of fact, through a door, and through the front door in the case of Austria, since a party is entering the Austrian Government which seems to represent a return to intolerance, xenophobia and forms of racism.	0.9019373711181891
And it is not a question of links with the past; it is a question of prospects for the future, and nothing could be more wrong than the right and left taking a divided stand on this.	0.8678832037536613
I belong to a world, the world of Liberal Catholics, which is not left-wing but which holds as dear as anyone else the values of tolerance and common European values, and will have nothing to do with policies that reject these values.	0.9049500221394533
The Council has done well to lay open this subject to Europe and to the world and if we do not set down these values in a Charter of Fundamental Rights, in a European Constitution, then we shall construct a Europe without a solid, lasting base.	1.0364915053810115
Commissioner Barnier, I know - at least I think I know - that you and the representatives of the Portuguese Presidency share these values: make the most of the chances you were given by the December Conference to include these subjects and principles, because this is the only way we will build a lasting Europe.	0.980425816099135
Mr President, I am in the happy position of being able to refer to a couple of striking contributions from a small group of Nordic sceptics and opponents of the drastic and growing integration process which, looked long and hard at, threatens the whole of democratic Europe.	0.6808924064614741
I am thinking of the contributions from Mr Bonde and Mr Sjöstedt who point out that the present contribution contains a string of relatively unconscious but undoubtedly rational initiatives dictated by the desire for power and pointing in the direction of a centralist and federalist EU.	0.651195194614502
They rightly included the problem with monetary union and centralist government and presented a number of alternative democratic principles.	0.4400375433035161
I might add that all rational political campaigning in my own country, Denmark, takes it for granted that, when we enlarge the circle of EU countries to include the envisaged huge number of new Member States and when we in that way extend the breadth of the Union, we cannot at the same time pursue further integration in depth, that is to say engage in a more intensive qualitative integration towards a United States of Europe.	0.8566437627683229
However, that is precisely what is happening.	1.130755185085383
With every single geographical extension to the area covered by the EU, we have seen how extensions in breadth have been followed by intensive extensions in depth, and that is precisely what the draft resolution from the Committee is contemplating, especially in paragraph 7 which says that there should be more thorough integration in depth.	0.8719246343646789
In the light of developments in recent days, it might well be asked what we really are to do about these intergovernmental conferences and treaty amendments when government leaders - in reality the European Council of Ministers - make decisions in relation to an independent Member State entailing intervention in that Member State' s democratic process.	0.8303297244398674
You can think what you like about Mr Haider, and I personally consider him to be a very dangerous politician, but you cannot just intervene in an independent and friendly country' s democratic process.	0.9021458733465743
When we hold intergovernmental conferences and consider changes to the Treaty, we must take into account the fact that the EU is developing all the time, sometimes in contravention of the Treaty, as we have just seen.	1.079810053093924
I welcome Commissioner Barnier and the Portuguese Presidency here this afternoon.	0.5977759364870001
On 14 February, we will see the launch of the IGC which is to be completed by the end of 2000.	0.9834970198464043
This is a big task but it can be done.	0.9582982616417776
I think it is generally agreed here this afternoon across all groups that the Helsinki agenda will not be sufficient to cover the necessary reform to prepare Europe for enlargement.	0.678744965077391
In other words we need to go further than what has been referred to as the important "Amsterdam leftovers" .	0.8267694911428429
These include the extension of qualified voting - in my country we accept that but not to areas of taxation - the re-weighting of voting in Council to favour larger states and the number of Commissioners in an enlarged Europe.	0.8281189713732491
In relation to the latter point, Ireland wants to maintain the right to nominate a full and equal Member of the Commission irrespective of the number of Member States joining.	0.7755555823741482
We are prepared to consider re-weighting the votes in the Council of Ministers, provided that the larger Member States are willing to agree to every Member State having a full and equal Member of the Commission.	0.6967122276173034
I feel I speak for many smaller countries when I make that particular point.	0.41680013746695044
At the IGC, we would also need a debate on the possible divisions of the Treaties into two - into a policy area and an area on the Constitution.	0.9582749619284724
We would accept the division of the Treaties providing it would not limit the control the smaller Member States had in the re-negotiation of the whole policy area of the Treaty.	0.8696413019313569
In other words, if we are not represented fully in the Commission we will not have an input into policy discussions.	0.9795374150962673
