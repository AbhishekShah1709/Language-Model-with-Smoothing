It is unique in that its expression is regulated directly by hypoxia.	0.7575837504551829
These properties are now being exploited in attempts aimed at the induction of new blood vessels in pathological situations such as ischemic heart disease.	0.8629383375258817
Five VEGF forms of 121 to 206 amino-acids are produced from a single gene by alternative splicing.	0.8541730058539272
Cells expressing VEGF usually express several forms simultaneously.	0.6221927380323239
VEGF121 does not contain exons 6 and 7 of the gene and consequently lacks a heparin binding ability.	0.9348554635249017
However, this form is fully  active as an inducer of angiogenesis, and as a blood vessel permeabilizing agent.	1.2858368031250154
Exon 6 and 7 contain 2 independent heparin binding domains.	0.7755796399905925
The VEGF form containing exon 7 (VEGF165) and the vascular endothelial growth factor form containing exon 6 (VEGF145) display similar biological potencies raising the question of why so many VEGF forms are required.	1.1155358135777647
It was found that VEGF121 diffuses better because it does not bind to heparan-sulfate proteoglycans.	0.774762664542703
In contrast, VEGF145 binds to extracellular matrix ad is released from it slowly.	0.8191316561090849
When the receptor binding properties of VEGF121 and VEGF165 were compared it was found that VEGF165 binds to a class of VEGF receptors that is not recognized by VEGF121.	0.9390152123890463
These receptors are encoded by the neuropilin-1 gene, and we have recently found that the related neuropilin-2 gene also encodes a VEGF165 receptor.	1.0103569431629884
We have recently found evidence indicating the neuropilins form complexes with another VEGF receptor, VEGFR-1.	0.7574812867683856
However, the biological function of this complex remains to be elucidated.	1.0848322824393521
In addition to mucositis and myelotoxicity as well known early reactions after radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy in advanced head and neck tumors, late toxicity following treatment is an often underestimated problem.	1.0851796990704539
The healing of wounds by secondary  intention is a simple method to close  operative defects.	1.068348237822144
The quality of wound healing will depend on the anatomic site on the face as well as on size and depth of the  defect.	1.1753684472681445
Best functional and cosmetic results are obtained at locations with concave  geometry and when the defect lies  symmetrically at the interface of two  anatomic subunits.	0.9916599025221656
Partial reconstruction or guiding sutures can create a symmetric  defect in relation to anatomic subunits which will heal by second intention.	0.8109418270716696
This simple and efficient operative procedure is ilustrated by two case reports.	0.8246410588564221
Background: Acute infectious mononucleosis (IM) is a selflimiting lymphoproliferative disease of EBV-infected (immortalised) B cells and poly-/oligoclonal cytotoxic T cells which are to a high percentage EBV-specific.	1.2349749451003056
In B cells EBV infection mainly leads to a latent infection with expression of EBV nuclear antigens 1-6 (EBNA1-6) and membrane antigens 1, 2A and 2B (LMP1, LMP2A and LMP2B).	0.9674267388535186
Expression of these EBV latent antigens leads to transformation and immortalisation of infected B cells.	0.726525578364845
Here we examined if also lytic EBV genes (i.e.	0.5815570924915642
BZLF1), which are associated with a productive EBV infection, are expressed during IM.	1.3046667986372609
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVCM) is a frequent underlying disease in young patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and sudden death.	1.0582044097198666
Treatment is frequently indicated and is mainly directed at the prevention of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death.	0.8835488040885957
In a minority of patients with progressive ARVCM and clinical signs of heart failure, pharmacological treatment with vasodilators, diuretics, and digitalis may be required.	1.0119038403229121
A prospective study was performed to compare the sensitivity and accuracy of ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) as a bone scan to detect subclinical invasion of the mandible by squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and floor of mouth.	1.2149125588705425
The typical clinical features of myasthenia gravis are weakness and excessive fatiguability of striated muscles that increases during the course of the day or after strenous exercise.	0.9775504218741945
Ocular muscle involvement with ptosis (in 50%) and diplopia (in 25%) are the most common initial signs.	1.3389768754130558
The disease can progress to bulbar muscles and to all other striated muscles (generalized myasthenia).	0.8692521176398456
The muscle fatiguability and a fluctuating course can mislead to a diagnosis of neurasthenia.	0.8188481816658401
Since the treatment of myasthenia gravis is directed at the pathogenetic mechanisms of the disease an early diagnosis is of great significance for the course of the disease.	1.1854099582948232
Also, a false positive diagnosis of myasthenia has to be avoided because of the potentially hazardous side effects of the therapy.	1.2664845328123404
The mainstay of the diagnosis is the history and a subtle clinical examination with tests of excessive muscle fatiguability.	1.2015514432919334
The injection of edrophonium (Tensilon), the electrodiagnostic testing after repitive stimulation (decrement test) and the testing for serum antibodies against acetylcholin receptors have to be performed to secure the diagnosis of myasthenia.	1.2018317465066015
The edrophonium test and the decrement test can yield false positive results in other neuromuscular diseases.	0.7926533461010397
Antibodies are present in 50% of ocular myasthenia and in 80-90% of the generalized form.	1.1900063425238772
The Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, other neuromuscular diseases, mitochondrial diseases, diseases of the cranial nerves, botulism and the rare congenital myasthenic syndromes have to be considered as differential diagnosis.	0.9388280981068163
The application of biodegradable implants is combined with advantages and disadvan- tages.	0.7633789344931246
They offer a great deal of innovative ideas.	0.7311021048330817
Best evaluation has been done with pins for the fixation of low loaded osteochondral fractures.	0.8383722937767455
When using 2,7 mm Polypin primary mechanical stabilility of distal radius fractures is comparable with the fixation by 1,8 mm K-wires.	0.9797331161629671
A prospective and randomised study with two years follow up, including 183 radial head fractures, showed no significant difference in results and complications in metal and polyactide implants.	1.251690003877534
For this localisation and other comparable indications the implant can be recommended.	0.8745001895356518
Despite the more extensive degradable device overall costs can be reduced with the polymer implant.	0.8843531130201983
Orien- truded polyactide screws showed good clinical results, newetheless resorption was extremely late within 5 to 7 years.	0.8323054319364648
The treatment of deep cartilage defects is a challenge for every orthopeadic surgeon.	1.0219906227987259
The potention for regeneration of cartilage tissue is minimal and leads to mechanically inferior fibrous tissue.	0.7423370621991158
The established techniques induce the growth of fibrous tissue but fail to prevent arthrosis.	0.8526725363390235
Autologous chondrocyte transplantation seems to be the most promising therapy concept with clinical relevance to reserves a full thickness cartilage defekt with hyaline-like cartilage.	0.9544899908839078
Outcome studies with a follow up from 2-10 years show in up to 90 % good and excellent results for defects on the femoral condyle and 70 % for the patella.	1.3492053701405897
Mechanical testing of the regenerated cartilage showed almost simular stiffness as nearly normal hyaline cartilage.	0.7425182762016146
The available data justify the acceptance of autologous chondrocyte transplantation as a standard procedure for limited indications and well-trained surgeons.	0.9873746660686985
Result of already inaugurated studies will show the potential of chondrocyte transplantation to prevent osteoarthritis.	0.8826902621018785
Vasculitides are rare diseases characterized by inflammation of blood vessels.	0.9289406054410527
According to diameter of the blood vessels involved in the inflammatory process, the clinical presentation and the histological appearance, different vasculitic syndromes may be distinguished.	1.2669845894904854
Primary vasculitides are of unknown origin while secondary vasculitides may be caused by drugs, malignancy or infection.	0.812219810073799
Panarteriitis nodosa caused by chronic Hepatitis B and mixed cryoglobulinemia secondary to chronic Hepatitis C are classical examples of vasculitides triggered by infections.	0.8776360623695405
However, these are rare complications of chronic viral hepatitis.	1.3618131176733568
Patients infected by HIV frequently suffer from vasculitis, which may be caused by opportunistic infections and by defects in immune regulation.	0.985218553682365
In numerous case reports, various other infectious particles have been reported to cause different forms of vasculitis, either by direct infection of endothelial cells or by induction of an immunologic process leading to blood vessel destruction.	1.0590478093646742
Immunologically mediated vasculitis secondary to infection may be due to a predisposing reactivity of the patient's immune system.	0.9439537739205152
After successful treatment of the infection, the vasculitis usually subsides.	0.9541691585514686
Therefore, all patients with vasculitis should be evaluated for underlying infection.	1.5417811581486858
To calculate canal compromise and decrease of midsagittal diameter caused by retropulsion of fragments into the spinal canal we analyzed the pre- and postoperative computed tomographies of 32 patients with unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures treated by USS (universal spine system).	1.020633714585649
Our intention was to examine the efficiency of ultrasound guided repositioning of the dispaced fragments which was performed in all 32 cases.	1.0317044133426925
We found a clear postoperative enlargement of canal area (ASP preoperatively 55 %, postop.	1.1616272801249863
80 %) and midsagittal diameter (MSD preop.	0.9010638492940186
10 of 13 patients presented a postoperative improvement of neurological deficit, no neurological deterioration occured.	1.047734655804597
Fractures with neurological deficit showed more canal compromise (52 %) and less midsagittal diameter (MSD compromise 51 %) than those without (40 % or 39 %).	1.1897590482677514
There was no correlation between the percentage of spinal canal stenosis and the severity of neurological deficit.	0.9025109179720094
Below L 1 the spinal canal is greater than between Th 11 and L 1, so a more important spinal stenosis is tolerated.	1.112725753389333
In case of unstable burst fractures with neurological deficit the ultrasound guided spinal fracture reposition is an effective procedure concerning the necessary improvement of spinal stenosis: an additional ventral approach for the revision of the spinal canal is unneeded.	1.0683168436362018
In fractures without neurologic deficit the repositioning of the displaced fragments promises an avoidance of long-term damages such as myelopathia and claudicatio spinalis.	0.7972897725562978
In common the traumatic spondylolisthesis is not a life threatening injury.	0.9426301917231991
An exact diagnosis is mandatory as well as a differentiated therapy.	1.1493416874998201
Especially the correct decision about the therapy (operative vs conservative) including the technical demanding operative procedures is based on an experienced surgeon.	1.1506109302586283
These patients should be transferred to a specialised centre.	0.7722832731375542
The intensity of DNA degradation in fixed tissues is dependent on the fixation solution and the fixation time.	0.9794069592673353
The aim of this study was the investigation of DNA degradation over fixation times of up to 70 days in different tissues (muscle, brain, liver, bone) and with different formalin concentration (2 %, 4 %, 8 %; unbuffered).	1.3592302822390252
An additional test was performed to see whether the fixed tissues could be individualized using PCR analysis.	0.9816683225985297
The smallest amounts of DNA were extracted from liver and brain and the largest from muscle and bone.	0.8802490113249285
The amount of DNA that could be extracted decreased with increasing formalin concentration, while at the same time DNA degradation increased.	1.091589812924074
With the PCR-VNTR system HUMTH 01, all fixed samples could be typed regardless of the fixation time and the formalin concentration.	0.9908293592774036
The draining sinus is an unpleasant complication of acne conglobata, acne fulminans, acne inversa, rosacea conglobata and rosacea fulminans (pyoderma faciale).	0.8751828497755384
It is most common on the face, especially in the nasolabial folds, and on the neck below the mandibular line.	1.0516709952102499
Clinically, it is an elongated (2-5 cm long), elevated, periodically inflamed lesion, which sporadically discharges pus.	1.4016916825971106
The lesion persists with no tendency to spontaneous regression.	0.7642466134894143
Histopathologically, it consists of elaborate, epithelialized galleries connected to the skin surface at multiple points.	1.0828137290934443
It contains corneocytes, hairs, bacteria, serum, inflammatory cells and epitheloid granulomas.	0.9719759563016112
A surgical thread placed into the skin provides a model in which the generation of sinus tracts can be studied.	0.9159301466120808
Intralesional corticosteroid injection, cryosurgery and isotretinoin are not always very effective.	0.8197336161889837
Sometimes complete excision of the lesion is necessary.	0.9181408392716462
The draining sinus is a special form of scar analogous to the pilonidal cyst.	0.792060616723168
A thoracic outlet syndrome is only rarely caused by osseous anomalies.	0.7916379286930751
Instead, it is a soft-tissue disease, where the C8 and T1 roots or the proximal inferior trunk of the brachial plexus are compressed by fibromuscular anomalies between the inferior cervical spine and the first rib or pleura.	1.1566779254279547
Thoracic outlet syndrome is a clinical diagnosis.	0.8982835612989721
If surgery is recommended, it should be concentrated on the fibromuscular anomalies and not on the first rib.	1.0747685431679148
Transaxillary removal of the first rib carries an important risk of serious complications.	1.2524414182023347
Among these, brachial plexus injury is the most frequent one.	1.0522092509152219
Objective: The objective of this survey was to investigate the current status of the epidural and intrathecal management in patients with chronic cancer and non-cancer pain in Germany and Austria.	1.2701749556971096
Methods: In June 1997 a questionnaire was sent to 598 German and Austrian anaesthesiologists specialized in pain therapy.	0.9255680685616781
Questions concerning the use of medicaments for epidural and intrathecal treatment of chronic pain were asked.	0.9411027946681377
Results: The response rate was 23%.	1.0465956514437393
The data show that 78% of the anaesthesiologists use epidural or intrathecal analgesia in the therapy of chronic pain.	1.0629147266751813
Local anaesthetics are used by 85% of these anaesthesiologists, followed by morphine (72%), clonidine (48%), buprenorphine (34%), baclofen (20%), fentanyl (13%) and sufentanil (10%).	1.3791057823626578
For most of the treatments local anaesthetics are used, again followed by opioids und clonidine.	0.9976888191853841
In the 137 answering pain clinics 79.821 epidural and intrathecal analgetic treatments are performed per year.	0.7630767258892094
Discussion: Epidural and intrathecal pain therapy is frequently used in Germany and Austria, either as a complementary or alternative treatment to systemic pain therapy.	1.1132588441926485
Local anaesthetics followed by opioids are the most commonly used medicaments for this treatment.	0.8701306596048833
For some of the applied substances neurotoxicological data are lacking.	0.8836282537123011
The use of these substances has to be considered very carefully.	1.2019221977682575
Intraartial conduction disturbances (IACD) are the known substrate of re-entrant atrial arrhythmias and their diagnosis is important for the selection of proper therapy.	1.0387637035717106
Signs of IACD can be missed on the standard ECG, and signal averaged (SA) P wave analysis has proved valuable for the evaluation of electrophysiological (EPS) properties of atrial myocardium.	1.0211840447815932
Unfavourable EPS effects of RAA pacing are known to electrophysiologists, but this aspect is rarely considered in normal practice, and RAA based pacing modes remain standard even for pts.	1.0555968062249763
We examined and compared EPS effects of different atrial pacing modes using two diagnostic tools: IEGM obtained from two atrial leads of biatrial pacing system (via telemetry) and time domain analysis of SA P wave in 22 pts.	0.9937685825226167
with BiA pacing system (implanted due to atrial arrhythmias and IACD).	0.7190153214652363
The results showed that different atrial pacing modes influence atrial activation timing parameters differently: RAA pacing aggravates IACD in comparison to sinus rhythm; the effects of CS pacing is less visible.	0.8922210872551317
BiA pacing normalises all atrial activation times.	0.5387266499864907
The normalisation of SA P wave duration, reduction of SA P wave dispersion, increasing of RMS 20 and decreasing of LAS 5 and finally abolition of presence of late atrial potentials in most of pts.	0.9922317879776686
indicates beneficial effects of BiA pacing (in pts.	0.933719683428382
with IACD) in comparison to sinus rhythm and RAA pacing.	0.9150955179365953
Unfavourable EPS effects of RAA pacing in patients with IACD indicates suitability the need for alternative (resynchronising) atrial pacing modes.	0.8622477668119098
Time domain analysis of SA P wave is a valuable and sensitive diagnostic tool for non-invasive evaluation of EPS effects of different modes of atrial pacing.	0.979209842747527
Background: We report a case of irreversible unilateral hypoglossal nerve palsy in connection with nasal septum surgery in intubation anaesthesia.	1.057131062166905
On account of the spatial distance, there is no danger of injuring the hypoglossal nerve during nasal surgery.	0.8728073819757547
However, in the otorhinolaryngological and anaesthesiological literature, some cases of hypoglossal palsy following endotracheal intubation, use of the laryngeal mask airway, bronchoscopy and laryngoscopy are reported.	1.120253742074202

In early stages of the disease granulocytes, microabscesses and new bone formations might suggest bacterial osteomyelitis that cannot be differentiated by histology.	0.9558431593124708
In intermediate phases lymphocytic and plasmacellular infiltrates are found, whereas in late phases sclerotic bone formations and fibrosis of the bone marrow are seen histologically.	1.0101728701132335
In chronic lymphoplasmacellular osteomyelitis, all clinical, radiological and histological findings, as well as negative bacteriological cultures, are mandatory and will allow a definitive diagnosis to be made.	0.9511144724223688
The disease may be uni- or multifocal, and new bone lesions may occur over time, as well as skin manifestations, which can be found years before or after bone involvement.	1.1447197808638947
The association with dermatological diseases and/or synovitis led to the acronym SAPHO syndrome (synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, osteomyelitis).	0.9797312958777166
For the treatment non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are effective for pain relief, reduction of swelling and dysfunction.	1.142731805457897
Antibiotics have been used in several series and are not effective.	1.158656523224008
Major surgery is not recommended even for recurrences, and the prognosis for growth and function is excellent in the long term despite recurrences over several years.	1.3027189707582993

The frequency and prognostic relevance of sarcoid-likelesions and microcarcinosis in regional lymph nodes in gastric cancer (n = 113; pT1-3, pN0-1, pM0, R0) were investigated; the prognostic value was compared with pT and pN stage, grading and Laurén's tumor classification with Cox's multivariate regression-model.	1.0278164199371547
Sarcoid like lesions were found in 34 % of the cases (n = 113).	1.0327384200406287
Statistical analysis did not indicate that they had any prognostic value or showed whether or not microcarcinosis or metastasis was present; they were independent of pT stage, histological tumor type, tumor grading, and the clinical course of disease.	1.175334237944301
Microcarcinosis (defined as scattered carcinoma cells within lymph node sinuses or pulp without adjacent stromal reaction) was revealed by immunohistochemistry in 90 % of pN0 cases; the presence of 3 or more tumor cells per lymph node section in over 10 % of sampled lymph nodes per case carried a significant prognostic value.	1.1319439779862703
In microcarcinosis without evidence of metastasis, the number of tumor cells and the number of involved lymph nodes are of prognostic value.	0.9802927472148872
In pN1 cases microcarcinosis was found as well as the metastases in 97 % and had no additional prognostic value.	1.446043787528204
Microcarcinosis alone has a different significance from lymph node metastasis for prognosis.	0.8557799812593974

TMLR (Transmyocardial laser revascularization) is a disputed cardiosurgical technique available in Europe since 1994 that aims to deliver additional blood flow to ischemic myocardium from the left heart chamber.	0.9971409738990118
Goal of our study is morphological examination of laser channels in human hearts to answer the questions: Are there patent laser channels with communication to the left chamber and to intramural vessels?	1.1267423682801774
We examined hearts of 10 patients who died during the first 18 days after TMLR.	1.034600920315261
Channels were examined in histological serial sections under the light microscope.	0.8985130753580305
Laser channels in the first days postoperatively have a lumen diameter of about 1 mm and are surrounded by coagulation necrosis about 500 µm thick.	1.028126781139274
Despite phagocytic removal of necrotic tissue the lumen diameter decreases during the following two weeks.	0.8690062126641264
Open intramyocardial channels can be shown in all patients.	0.7532991691918565
These channels communicate with intramural vessels, but in no instance with chamber lumen.	1.011773029915091
Our results suggest that clinical benefits are based on improved distribution of coronary blood.	0.8746545009110281
Additional blood is not delivered from left chamber lumen to the myocardium.	0.7945050872237116
However, our patients represent the small subgroup of the deceased.	1.398378325849791
If similar observations can be made in the majority of patients living symptomfree after TMLR remains open.	1.0147055026019054
Recurrent miscarriages are, like sporadically occurring miscarriage, often (approx.	0.9157095109631629
50 %) due to chromosomal aberrations.	1.0222888499346985
An undefined proportion of the other half may be due to immunological incompliances.	0.9036265290513594
The basis for this assumption is the fact that the maternal immune system recognizes paternal antigens and rejects them.	1.006909071938131
The initial hypothesis that such immune reaction is due to a high similarity between the maternal and paternal HLA systems (HLA sharing) is most likely incorrect.	1.0841537261952479
Nevertheless, the incomplete recognition of the fetus by the maternal immune system and the resulting insufficient protection is basis for the active immune therapy with partner or donor lymphocytes.	1.1242334904027387
Several placebo-controlled studies have been performed.	0.9772496813166475
Due to the small number of cases, results were not significant.	1.0562218099978549
A metaanalysis of all studies, however, proves significant effects of the active immune therapy.	0.9912820173640202
The risks of active immune therapy led to the development of passive immune therapy with immune globulins (IVIG).	0.9398378302474683
This therapy, however, is relatively expensive and obviously no more successful than the active immune therapy.	0.9422712876776176
In a metaanalysis of all published results, IVIG was not significantly more effective than treatment with placebo.	0.9685213156536443
The indication for both forms of immune therapy is given after 3 or more consecutive abortions, after exclusion of other reasons for these abortions.	1.0930700291970579
It appears that only primary aborting patients are suitable for active immune therapy.	0.7770108728562384
Athough the concept of immune therapy is still under debate, alternative concepts are not available.	1.0137811776262504
Hence, new therapeutic approaches are also not available.	1.0775622615239056
The first electronic implantable hearing aids for patients with hearing loss are coupled to the ossicular chain or perilymph during implantation and are now available.	0.9418134129794181
Our new Tübingen implant designed for sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is the combination of an implantable microphone and piezotransducer.	1.0465104938114418
To avoid hearing losses during implantation, the Tübingen piezotransducer will be (1) fixed to the mastoid cavity and (2) positioned to one of the ossicular target points.	1.142686255125261
This can be done with a micromanipulator which will be implanted together with transducer and microphone in the mastoid cavity.	1.0160616378867224
The manipulator weights 0.7 g. With four degrees of freedom, it allows highly secure and safe positioning of the transducer's probe tip to the ossicular chain under close to stereotactic conditions.	1.233784366937733
The main advantages of the present micromanipulator are (1) easy handling during surgery, (2) the transducer's precise positioning to the ossicular target point with sufficient degrees of freedom, and (3) the transducer's stable fixation in the mastoid cavity in the final position.	1.1712383960773705
Following integrated safety as the leading principle, ossicular or inner ear injuries caused, e.g., by the patient's head movement or unintentional manual contact by the surgeon, are minimized.	1.1157916191580886
The micromanipulator is, as it were, the surgeon's vibration-free "artificial hand".	1.2058876675594346
The manipulator's development and its optimization to the mastoid cavity by test implantation in 50 human temporal bones are shown in detail.	0.9218383685046333
While coupling the transducer to the body of the incus, transducer, microphone, and micromanipulator can be implanted into 76% of all mastoid cavities without protrusion.	1.038467410732519
In the case of transducers coupling to the long process of the incus, the protrusion-free implantation rate of the above-mentioned three implant modules is 78%.	1.026814354123274
The role of neuroimaging in the acute setting of head trauma is to diagnose the extent of intracranial injury and to identify all lesions which require urgent neurosurgical treatment.	1.0820499022164916
Computed tomography (CT) remains the most important diagnostic tool for initial screening of trauma victims.	1.0621188631267247
Although magnetic resonance imaging (MR) has higher sensitivity to most traumatic lesions than CT, due to the ease and speed of CT, and the fact that sufficient monitoring of critically ill patients during the examination is much easier with CT than with MR, mean that MR is not the imaging modality of choice for the initial diagnostic work-up.	1.19749991650927
Recent MR techniques such as FLAIR or diffusion imaging further improve the sensitivity of MR in head trauma.	0.8441024598590194
Conventional angiography is currently indicated only for few suspected vascular lesions (e.g.	0.6294286237343933
traumatic arterio-venous fistulas, vascular dissections).	0.9011233156863804
Injuries to the posterior cruciate ligament are among the major injuries to the knee joint.	0.89666087106621
Today we are often confronted with an inapproprate and delayed diagnosis of this injury and its concomitant lesions.	0.9713313690306045
Additionally, the outcome of operative treatment has not yet reached an acceptable rate of satisfactory results.	1.1131335269386056
Therefore, the goal of this current concept review is to give a comprehensive insight into anatomy and biomechanics, injury mechanisms and pathobiomechanics, based on our experiences and data from the international literature.	1.1014848240935688
A further goal is to clarify diagnostic problems with respect to clinical examination and imaging techniques.	0.981700102730796
We also present a differential concept for the perioperative and conservative management of posterior cruciate ligament deficient knees in order to also adequately address concomitant injuries such as posterolateral rotatory instability and combined anterior cruciate ligament injuries with the aim of further improving results.	1.1070591487563515
Sevoflurane, like all currently used volatile anaesthetics, is degraded by carbon dioxide absorbents.	0.9044395656391971
The most significant degradant is a haloalkene known trivially as "compound A".	0.8630023636673955
Compound A is nephrotoxic in rats and, at higher doses, in nonhuman primates, causing proximal tubular necrosis.	1.092717131661028
There has been much interest in the potential for compound A toxicity in humans.	0.9966575402778047
Inhaled compound A concentrations are greatest at low flow rates, high sevoflurane concentrations, warmer absorbent, barium hydroxide vs soda lime, and drier absorbent.	0.9891645898925542
Typical inspired compound A concentrations during low-flow and closed-circuit sevoflurane anaesthesia in humans are 8-24 and 20-32 ppm with soda lime and barium hydroxide lime, respectively.	0.9713388968108689
Renal effects of compound A production during sevoflurane anesthesia have been examined in surgical patients and volunteers, using standard (creatinine clearance, serum BUN and creatinine) and experimental (urine excretion of protein, glucose, NAG, GST, AAP) markers of renal function.	0.9928291300618821
Investigations to date in surgical patients show similar renal effects of low-flow sevoflurane, low-flow isoflurane or high-flow sevoflurane.	1.24957937717238
There have been no case reports of compound A-associated renal injury in humans.	0.9672872757234835
In volunteers, one study found changes in experimental but not conventional renal markers, while other investigations show no significant changes in either standard or experimental markers.	1.0472196131439349
The mechanism of compound A nephrotoxicity in rats appears to involve metabolism to glutathione and cysteine conjugates, and their subsequent renal uptake and metabolism by pathways that are different in rats and humans.	1.0029625288818702
In the report of the 1995 World Health Federation/International Society and Federation of Cardiology (WHF/ISFC) Task Force on the Definition and Classification of Cardiomyopathies, the definition of heart muscle diseases was updated.	0.961636690394529
Idiopathic, autoimmune, and infectious forms of inflammatory cardiomyopathy are now recognized in this definition.	0.9868127362382989
Enteroviruses, adenoviruses and cytomegaloviruses are considered as main etiopathological factors in the pathogenesis of inflammatory heart disease.	0.8828420900579287
We report our experience in managing a temporal bone fracture after head trauma that had no apparent clinical signs.	0.9517340238676535
Recurrent CSF rhinorrhea and meningitis lead to extensive diagnostic procedures.	0.6986321201165367
Operative exploration of the temporal bone demonstrated a fracture line along the horizontal part of the carotid artery.	1.003243467070562
The location of the fracture did not cause such typical symptoms as hearing impairment, facial paralysis, vertigo or tinnitus.	1.0138355012685631
Only CSF liquorrhea through the Eustachian tube indicated a fracture at the lateral skull base.	0.8738049146705364
Hyperkeratosis lenticularis perstans (Flegel's disease) is a rare but clinically and histologically highly characteristic genodermatosis.	1.03610516173687
We report on new immunohistochemical and ultrastructural findings suggesting a complex disorder of epidermal differentiation.	1.1268676185774857
In this context, a good response to calcipotriol, a synthetic vitamin D3 derivative is of particular interest.	1.1170257674650814
Pulmonary embolism is a frequent and potentially life-threatening event with uncharacteristic clinical manifestations.	1.0471386025625318
Diagnosis is commonly established by ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy and pulmonary angiography.	0.8103910158779569
Both methods, however, carry substantial drawbacks.	1.006274989276793
Therefore, clinicians claim that there is a need for an accurate and non-invasive diagnostic modality.	1.2296973851855484
Spiral CT of the pulmonary arteries is a recent modality, that allows reliable visualization of emboli in pulmonary arteries up to fourth-order branches.	1.066329038247211
This paper reviews the technical aspects, typical findings and diagnostic pitfalls of this recent technique.	0.9724435646714706
The potential role of spiral CT in the screening of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism is discussed and selected cases are presented.	1.2132138332733258
Introduction: Interleukin-12-p70 (IL-12-p70) is a potent immunoregulatory cytokine composed of a heavy chain (p40) and a light chain (p35).	1.278568829883561
Contradicting results have been reported with regard to leukocyte release and systemic concentration of IL-12 after polytrauma.	1.1073462943807553
Methods: We daily analyzed systemic concentrations of IL-12 in polytrauma patients (n = 37, mean ISS 33.9) in comparison to healthy donor values during intensive care course by ELISA.	1.2319296960604345
Patients were divided according to their mean IL-12 levels into those with elevated IL-12 (group 1, n = 7), those with decreased IL-12 (group 2, n = 4) and those with IL-12 in the normal range (group 3, n = 26).	1.324165482336358
Results: Patients in group 1 revealed elevated levels of IL-12 up to p70 > 1000 pg/ml and p40 > 2500 pg/ml.	1.2113873252522298
The common clinical feature of group 1 was a thorax trauma in combination with pneumonia (85 % survivors).	1.0037771512901417
Patients with single thorax trauma or pneumonia without thorax trauma (group 3) showed normal IL-12 values.	1.2453671600546037
Patients with decreased IL-12 levels revealed also a thorax trauma and pneumonia but all patients succumbed.	0.8356896693394408
The groups significantly differ in their stay in the intensive care unit, in TISS, in MODS score and in respiratory ratio, but not in ISS, mean CRP values and leukocyte counts.	1.242250869200579
Correlation analysis revealed no significant relation between systemically altered IL-12 values and clinical parameters, with the exception of a negative correlation of p70 and ISS (r = -0.785) or MODS score (r = -0.314) in group 1.	1.074791276374076
Conclusions: After major injuries there is no overall suppression of IL-12 formation.	1.3096793524404933
Patients with normal or elevated IL-12 levels belong mainly to the survivors, whereas patients with decreased IL-12 levels are at high risk of succumbing to multi-organ failure.	1.0403244830602614
This article reviews the pathogenesis and clinical and imaging findings in shoulder impingement syndrome.	0.9573258077150011
Shoulder impingement is caused by compression of the supraspinatus tendon underneath the coracoacromial arch, mainly in forward flexion of the arm.	0.8530027783422623
Different stages of impingement syndrome are described.	0.6804624084451527
Stage I relates to edema and hemorrhage of the supraspinatus tendon.	0.677773607794076
Stage II is characterized by bursal inflammation and fibrosis, as well as tendinopathy.	0.7986428654891405
In stage III there is a tear of the rotator cuff.	0.8829976476223663
Moreover, calcifying tendinitis, fractures and pain originating from the cervical spine may mimic shoulder impingement syndrome.	1.027755052528431
Imaging is important for the exact diagnosis.	0.8466459591339395
Standard radiographs are the basis of imaging in shoulder impingement syndrome.	0.8276589217975753
They may demonstrate subchondral sclerosis of the major tuberosity, subacromial spurs, and form anomalies of the acromion.	1.0027202062573566
They are also important in the differential diagnosis of shoulder impingement syndrome and demonstrate calcifying tendinitis, fractures and neoplasm.	0.95959042392906
Ultrasonography has found acceptance as a screening tool and even as a final diagnostic method by many authors.	1.0079663125124205
However, there is a high interobserver variability in the demonstration of rotator cuff tears.	1.141200681707702
Its usefulness has therefore been questioned.	0.6019645954267603
MR imaging is probably the method of choice in the evaluation of the rotator cuff and surrounding structures.	0.9144275925661571
Several investigations have demonstrated that differentiation of early findings, such as tendinopathy versus partial tears, may be difficult with MR imaging.	1.0948418551146373
However, reproducibility for full-thickness tears appears to be higher than for sonography.	1.1184006893173377
Moreover, specificity appears to be superior to sonography.	1.1565520495294837
MR arthrography is not universally accepted.	0.7122397449334893
However, it allows for more exact differentiation of discrete findings and may be indicated in preoperative planning.	1.2713281255564703
Standard arthrography and CT have a limited role in the current assessment of the rotator cuff.	1.0378752437263044
Gastric carcinoma of the infiltrative type (according to Ming) occasionally shows adenomatous differentiation only.	0.8670138947260216
Over the past 18 years, we have observed 23 cases of this tumour type, accounting for 3.6 % of all surgically treated gastric carcinomas.	1.3077737082443193
Macroscopically they were classified as Borrmann IV or III, while histologically most of them were well differentiated.	1.0577501617885938
Histologically, these tumours retained the pre-existing structures of the stomach, most readily observable at the tunica muscularis propria; a pronounced desmoplasia was also characteristic, particularly in the submucosal and subserosal layers.	1.0817392247885482
In all cases the tumour tissue spread inside lymphatic vessels.	0.9594763320153994
All but 2 cases with metastatically involved lymph nodes, often small, showed infiltration of the lymph node sinus; in three quarters of cases the serosa was infiltrated by the tumour.	1.1892113550496577
Significant findings among the patients under observation for extended periods included bilateral ovarian metastases in 4 of 5 women examined and tumour recurrence at the anastomosis in 6 of 9 patients in whom Billroth II operation had been performed.	1.0045573984073548
The mean survival time of 16 patients was 14.9 months.	0.9658239993979282
Owing to the diffuse type of tumour growth, extensive surgery is recommended as in cases of signet ring cell cancer.	1.066158003849438
The high incidence of small lymph node metastases from this type of tumour should also be taken in account at preoperative staging.	1.0144462702600312
Preoperative diagnosis of this tumour subtype is difficult, because histological criteria alone do not allow clear identification.	1.0988872336046052
Close cooperation with clinical investigators is necessary, and intraoperative assessment of the tumour - including frozen section of necessary - in particular is of the outmost importance.	1.4022669308295916
One rare case of so-called massive idiopathic osteolysis Gorham-Stout is presented.	0.7581040452448092
In a 77-year-old female patient the whole right femoral head and neck of femur was resorbed within 2.5 month following trauma.	1.1686489769602637
As a histologic cause for the osteolysis, a marked stimulation of osteoclasts on the spongiosa, especially intracortically, was observed.	1.1723333211500866
The course and the clinical findings are described, and the pathogenesis and treatment are discussed in comparison with the present literature.	1.53391530512131
The results suggest that an early antiresorptive therapy (calcitonin, bisphosphonates) could stop the progressive osteolytic changes.	0.9811199662926984
In this paper the relationship between psychodiagnosis and client-centered therapy is discussed.	1.0005635989965618
Rogers is wrongly said to have rejected any kind of diagnosis and that this therapy form has therefore developed an ambiguous relationship to this issue.	0.962995545259555
If one sees psychodiagnosis as something psychodynamic, and symptoms as defense strategies against underlying conflicts, then a comprehensive 'status diagnosis' using more or less traditional psychiatric categories appears compatible with theory-led client-centered diagnosis in the initial phase and during the course of therapy.	1.0097846307764837
Client-centered psychotherapy itself may be seen as a continuous process of dialogue in which 'assumed diagnoses' (embedded in the therapist's 'empathic knowledge') are jointly checked and in which the client through direct experience learns to understand and change his 'diagnosis'.	0.988461126936521
In the examination of reversible segmental (articular) hypomobile dysfunction (blockage) of the spine, we have to recognize by palpation the feeling of beginning resistance at the end of the passive movement ("barrier").	1.137389316339568
This is the main finding to diagnose segmental (articular) dysfunction.	0.8717863042255823
Normal mobility gives us a slowly increasing resistance with possible springing at the end.	0.957117623550737
In contrary, the sudden feeling of hard tension without springing is seen as typical for the restricted movement in articular dysfunction, i. e. restriction of joint facet gliding.	0.9349975976608004
Multiple intra- and paraglandular lymph nodes develop in the parotid gland, including salivary gland tissue with acinar and ductal formations.	1.0310518162640983
In the same way heterotopic salivary gland tissue can be localized in cervical lymph nodes.	0.9875023923363925
Except for the frequently occurring Warthin tumours, primary salivary gland tumours, which develop in the lymph nodes of the parotid gland or the cervical lymph nodes, are rare.	1.161592029960722
Examples of these are adenomas (pleomorphic adenoma, basal cell adenoma) and carcinomas (acinic cell carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma).	0.9095748646588298
Three of our own observations (sebaceous lymphadenoma, acinic cell carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma) are analysed.	0.9257476068333048
The condition for the diagnosis of primary salivary gland tumour within a lymph node is reliable evidence that the salivary gland tissue is tumour-free and that no other occult carcinoma is present.	1.0703445665891769
We report on a three month old infant presenting with vaginal bleeding.	1.0749820801169514
Precocious pseudopuberty due to an autonomous ovarian cyst was diagnosed.	0.7752996215679676
Within three months the follicular cyst spontaneously regressed.	0.7834196734735099
Elevated estradiol levels also decreased spontaneously.	0.5373899020322701
The purpose of this study was to determine whether 24 hour patch testing with 0.5% sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) could reliably predict skin susceptibility to an irritant when compared with the alkali resistance test (ART), a widely used method employing sodium hydroxide.	1.1119828090397181
After having given informed consent, 40 patients (age range from 20 to 60 years) with an active irritant contact dermatitis (ICD), 40 patients in whom ICD had cleared, as well as 40 healthy volunteers serving as controls were tested.	1.1535709637109777
The skin responses to SLS were assessed both visually and by measurement of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) as an indicator of stratum corneum integrity.	0.9831770499487006
SLS significantly increased the erythema scores and TEWL in patients with healed ICD, and the increase of TEWL was even more pronounced in patients with active ICD.	1.2000046181541382
By contrast, a decrease in alkali resistance was found in patients with active ICD only but not in patients with healed ICD.	1.1240886921323172
The data obtained indicate that the SLS test, unlike ART, may provide a non-invasive tool predicting a possible constitutional skin susceptibility or indicating a subclinically impaired epidermal barrier function.	1.0175751879540595
However, because of the relatively high interindividual variation, a cut-clear statement concerning the skin susceptibility cannot be made by this test.	1.208445897581732
On the other hand, the ART seems only to be useful for following and documenting the healing period following ICD.	0.9006040352340527
Introduction: The correction of low to moderate astigmatism is possible today by means of photoablation (PRK), while the treatment of moderate and higher astigmatism still involves refractive keratotomy.	1.1785078294795954
Experience has shown that cataract surgery, using modern tunnel techniques with self-healing incisions, results in earlier stability in both the refractive outcome and wound healing.	1.081623983611476
In this study, we attempted to combine the advantages of lamellar keratotomy with those of a pair-wise T-incision as arcuate lamellar keratotomy (ALK).	0.9868164187892356
An often unrecognized but potentially fatal complication, mostly seen in posttraumatic patients under intensive care, is reactive acute cholecystitis.	0.9777340479462321
On account of the high specificity of ultrasound diagnosis in the biliary system we decided to examine the ultrasound criteria for early detection of posttraumatic cholecystitis.	1.0611858636109148
Ultrasound of the abdomen was performed prospectively, seven times on different days, in each of 40 artificially respirated patients under intensive care conditions over a period of 12 months.	1.0967114591798137
The results show that artificial respiration, parenteral feeding and previous trauma can lead to tardive (28/40) wallthickening or to a three-layered wall of the gallbladder (9/40).	0.9771051031876942
In 22.5 % of patients (9/40) we found the sonographic signs of acute cholecystitis.	1.1377807598111638
In correlation with the clinical signs, cholecystectomy was indicated in only two patients.	0.9519574109493305
The preoperative ultrasonographic findings and clinical signs of 23 patients with the diagnosis of acute reactive cholecystitis were analysed retrospectively.	1.0349263012892544
We found good correlation between sonographic and clinical signs of acute cholecystitis in 21 of these 23 patients.	0.8988348272956296
Our study shows that the morphological correlate of a thickened three-layered gallbladder wall can occur in the context of systemic alterations, even if there is no underlying cholecystitis.	1.1068513687739938
The diagnosis of acute reactive cholecystitis and the indication for cholecystectomy should be based on the synopsis of pathologic and clinical findings.	1.0248098575365654
Osteoporosis is characterized by reduced bone mass and a deterioration of bone structure which results in an increased fracture risk.	1.033006506294698
The purpose of this review is to evaluate structure analysis techniques in the diagnosis of osteoporosis.	0.9420846098469035
Several imaging techniques were applied to analyze trabecular bone, such as conventional radiography, high-resolution computed tomography (HR-CT) and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI).	1.1880243773207857
The best results were obtained using high-resolution tomographic techniques.	1.050669174345179
The highest spatial resolutions in vivo were achieved using HR-MRI.	0.7406784963619271
These studies show that texture parameters and bone mineral density predict bone strength and osteoporotic fractures in a complementary fashion.	0.9347080193275163
Combining both techniques yields the best results in the diagnosis of osteoporosis.	0.9718941673480214
Classification of cosmetics, which are more and more similar to topical therapeutic agents, is getting increasingly difficult for dermatologists.	1.1181018907018825
Their definition within the EU and the respective European directives, replacing national laws step by step, will be briefly presented.	0.778153771638927
The problems of distinguishing cosmetics from medicinal products will be discusssed in detail by examples from clinical practice.	0.7778387407261508
Finally, we will review the various active substances which tend to be added to cosmetics following the global trend in the cosmetic industry towards developing "medicinally" active cosmetics, and in the pharmaceutical industry towards "cosmetically" oriented medicinal products as part of a current "life-style" ideology.	1.1083297471706761
In some clinical dermatological fields these active substances may allow the dermatologists to use cosmetics as topical therapeutic agents.	0.8545812223748952
The decision whether a rotator cuff tear has a traumatic or degenerative origin still causes some controversy.	0.8430731805847336
Especially in medical expert appraisements the etiology of the rotator cuff tear plays an important role refering to insurance services for the patient.	0.9845811841058465
The purpose of this paper is to compare the intraoperative pathomorphologic shape of the cuff tear in traumatic and degenerative cases.	1.03856445257746
This study reports of 56 patients with rotator cuff tears which were devided in primarily acute, subacute traumatic and degenerative study groups refering to their history of present illness.	0.9440404892757146
We considered the location of the tear, the shape and the size.	1.1527134412307931
Furthermore the grade of retraction of the supraspinatus tendon, its quality and the shape of the long head of biceps were examined.	0.9761907926773746
The results showed that in general the shape of the tear gives only in some cases significant information whether the etiology is traumatic or not.	1.1454259212787319
The isolated rupture of the subscapularis muscle and the hematoma at the edge of the tendon is siginificant for the trauma.	0.960125796924133
In comparison with the degenerative study group the tenosynovitis and the dislocation of the long head of biceps is in our study sigificant for traumatic tears.	1.086508183784637
Health care decision making in incompetent severely ill patients presents many difficult medical, ethical, and legal problems for the physician.	0.9398229101117636
At the same time nurses represent the group of medical professionals who have the closest contact with the patient and who have to carry out most of the decisions and instructions.	1.2340387431645499
Barber's disease is produced by short hairs that penetrate the interdigital spaces of the hands.	0.967178592378779
The following chronic inflammatory reaction causes fistulas or sinuses and cysts.	0.8176190837017954
We present the case of a patient with interdigital pilonidal sinuses of all web spaces in both hands.	0.8533127996380427
Such an extensive case of this occupational disease has so far not been reported.	0.932114396439303
The treatment of critically ill patients compromises frequently between an adequate fluid resuscitation for maintenance of a sufficient regional perfusion on the one hand and the avoidance of pulmonary edema on the other hand.	0.9966449712012921
The application of the transpulmonary indicator dilution method allows the orientation of fluid therapy by using the parameters 'intrathoracic blood volume' and 'extravascular lung water'.	0.9115137205379388
This technique is less invasive than the pulmonary artery catheter since it only needs a 3 or 4 French catheter in the femoral artery.	1.066827560149983
Additionally, controlling the fluid therapy with the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is severely limited in the mechanically ventilated patient.	1.0351493692756524
Therefore, the intrathoracic blood volume may be of advantage in the critically care patient in comparison to the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure to assess the cardiac preload.	1.230829374771911
Furthermore, the indocyanine clearance adds a valuable parameter to assess liver function when the double indicator technique is used.	0.9436866640250969
Hypnosis, autogenic training, progressive relaxation and biofeedback show good empirical evidence concerning relaxation-therapy and are useful techniques in psycho- or behavior-therapy.	1.0238355394630767
Though they share some aspects with body-oriented psychotherapy these relaxation-techniques show a modern scientific orientation and are therefore to seperate from religious meditation.	0.9330673212689664
Though in details somewhat different, the methodology of these techniques creates a framework, in which the psychophysiological determined relaxation response is easily elicited.	1.110883543640081
However, regular practice of the patients is requiered.	1.695886185784707
Focussed attention, imagination and new attributions of bodily or mental perceptions play a dominant role concerning the therapeutic effects, which may contribute to enhanced internal selfcontrol and selfesteem.	0.9937470179849286
Controlled clinical studies give evidence to positive effects concerning various psychosomatic disorders (e.g.	0.672217834999159
headache, pain, ess.	0.8706233423089695
hypertension), as well as anxiety and sleeping disorders.	0.960988635197846
As components of psychotherapeutic or behavioral programs, there is even more evidence for effects of relaxation in a broad spectrum of disorders (e.g.	0.9243804893801124
Relaxation therapy is a well established and scientific-based component in the treatment of psychic, psychosomatic or psychiatric disorders, except psychosis.	1.128999719236552
Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis is a rare autosomal recessive connective tissue disease first described in 1873 by Murray.	0.9370082939048721
Major diagnostic criteria are multiple cutaneous tumors and gingival hypertrophy; minor criteria include contractures, osteolytic lesions and a positive family history.	0.9451773256167298
A 35-year-old woman suffering from Crohn's disease for 3 years developed painful erythematous nodular lesions predominantly on the dorsa of her hands and feet, as well as on her elbows and wrists.	0.9764560572590882
The clinical features and histopathological picture of leukocytoclastic vasculitis were both highly suggestive of erythema elevatum diutinum.	0.7899617995781507
No improvement of the skin lesions was observed during treatment with high doses of oral steroids.	1.3250213163901585
In contrast, treatment with dapsone resulted in a marked reduction of skin lesions.	0.9982968808666134
During a new attack of her Crohn's disease the erythema elevatum diutinum lesions flared again.	0.8606724647046587
The parallel clinical course of erythema elevatum diutinum and Crohn's disease, as well as the detection of immune complexes and neutrophilic granulocytes in lesions of both diseases, strongly suggest a common etiology.	1.0469830107586617
This hypothesis is discussed in context with this case and the recent literature.	1.0838451370880784
The mammalian brain is capable of a substantial functional reorganization, manifesting on a cortical somatotopical and on a behavioral level.	0.8556945231407213
Possible mechanisms are reviewed based on the work by others and ourselves on somatosensory reorganization in humans.	0.9360670559696573
The somatosensory system is characterized by divergent projections from the periphery to the cerebral cortex.	0.950193793848967
Changes in synaptic weights allow for reorganization of sensory processing: On one side, limb amputation will result in a representational "invasion" of the deafferentated cortex from neighboring regions with concomitant perceptual changes.	0.9611381971667949
On the other side, sensorimotor training can increase the representational cortical zone of a limb.	0.9997783576088106
Plastic changes can be temporary or persistent.	0.5783430176310864
Modulating factors like pain and certain drugs seem to induce a permissive state in the cortex resulting in enhanced reorganization.	0.8871623889620375
Thus, specific physical training combined with pharmacoceutical modulation holds promise to improve functional recovery after brain lesions.	1.0977559776735322
There have been some prospective randomized studies which compared primary angioplasty with intravenous thrombolysis in patients with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI).	0.9373936667897041
However, a substantial number of patients with AMI who would not have been included in those trials are treated with one of these two therapeutic options.	1.3111610300598247
To describe the proportions, characteristics, and outcome of these patients treated with primary angioplasty or thrombolysis we analyzed the data of the prospective "Maximal Individual Optimized Therapy for Acute Myocardial Infarction" (MITRA) trial.	1.21186969835345
Chronic infectious diseases may run over many months and years, accompanied by only mild clinical signs and often without organ-specific symptoms.	0.9606611090431454
People with any kind of immuno deficiency are more frequently affected by chronic infections.	0.7823082104195723
History, physical examination, laboratory tests, microbiological tests and imaging methods may lead to an exact diagnosis.	1.0678844034122685
The most important differential diagnosis are autoimmune diseases, amyloidosis and malignant lymphoma.	0.9372216674985522
Background: We perform partial sphincterectomy during cataract surgery in cases with very small pupil (< 3 mm).	1.1866262879876386
We assume that the small pupil is mainly due to a fibrosis ring of the sphincter muscle.	0.9343758273089189
Trauma scores in emergency medicine quantitatively characterise the severity of trauma victims' injuries and physiologic derangements.	0.9160387907489971
They are used to detect and assess patients and have applications in guiding patient care and early therapeutic decisions.	0.9844281995116155
In the pre-clinical setting, an effective trauma index meets the following criteria: - It is highly reliable with regard to identifying high- and low-risk patients.	1.130523831106559
- It has high face-validity.	0.9748486322492741
- It has high inter- and intra-rater reliability.	0.9809314758799595
- It is easy to use and allows rapid, accurate measurements.	1.2403873706151967
The most widely accepted injury severity index is probably the Injury Severity Score (ISS).	0.9010814145554276
It is calculated as the sum of the squares of the three most severely injured body regions, and was originally developed as a means to standardise the description of injuries sustained in motor vehicle accidents.	1.0515492229002283
The Trauma Score (TS) represents the gold standard of physiologic scoring of injury severity.	0.868908788233898
It summarises the numerical assessments of the central nervous and cardiopulmonary system functions.	0.8851898075570988
The recently developed Mainz Emergency Evaluation Score (MEES) is based upon numerical specification of the vital signs, including a pain scale, and has been designed as a dynamic score.	1.218478787529519
Nevertheless, limitations of the established trauma score systems have been described.	1.1330813751359041
Mortality and patient outcome do not strictly correlate with injury severity scoring.	0.8260377663561869
In addition, intubated or paralysed patients were excluded from outcome studies since the scoring systems lacked options for evaluation of pathophysiological conditions after therapeutic interventions.	0.9842618051839641
Thus, therapeutic efficacy could hardly be assessed, and subsequent scoring during time periods was impossible.	1.1818587505288982
The accurate definition of comprehensive evaluation of a trauma victim is challenging, for example, "pain" as chosen in the MEES must be regarded as a highly desirable piece of information although its rating may prove difficult, especially when classifying unconscious patients.	1.1462059204800608
Further criticisms of the above-mentioned trauma indices could include omission of the trauma victim's age, gender, pre-injury health status, or the influence of alcohol or additional medication.	0.9802163714727092
Moreover, questioning the interrater reliability of injury severity scoring, a recent study revealed bias in assigning values to trauma patients: trained raters classified injury severity with significantly higher indices than less experienced researchers.	1.040439450448283
If trauma indices in pre-hospital emergency medicine were relied upon as the only means of evaluating a trauma patient and guiding therapeutic approaches, significant numbers of trauma victims requiring major interventions would be missed.	0.988507592556687
Resuscitative treatment regimens must not be based solely upon indices, since, e.g., in states of shock injury scores do not correlate with fluid resuscitative requirements.	1.1462994495957495
Furthermore, a qualitative assignment of single vital-function parameters as crucial indices for a patient's condition never reflects the broad range of a patient's profile.	1.2362246539449828
Many multiple-trauma patients do benefit from controlled ventilation in clinical experience even though pulse oximetry values are within the physiological range, and the administration of analgesics or even pre-hospital anaesthesia has often proved advantageous for trauma patients in the field.	1.1657742810526275
Providing the opportunity of subsequent patient evaluation and the efficacy of acute care, the MEES has been developed as a dynamic scoring system.	1.1405301694478358
This design is extremely desirable and must be regarded as an indispensible criterion for future scoring systems.	0.8180446615845816
In view of the peculiarities of field emergency medicine, pre-hospital indices do have limitations.	0.8467323528856413
The parameters "unknown patient", time pressure, unprecise measurements, lack of diagnostic facilities, incomplete evaluation, and limited statistical power cannot be eliminated.	1.1087154373732324
Accurate prediction of outcome within early time-frames is therefore not possible.	0.8018407401097274
Ossification of the Achilles tendon is the result of a traumatic, hypoxic injury of the tendon.	1.0370714108375263
The usually asymptomatic ossification has a clinical importance only in case of a new trauma.	1.103859050505708
We report about a patient with an isolated fracture of the ossification without an accompanying rupture of the Achilles tendon.	1.1308603030427882
Because of the radiologically "occult" fracture the diagnosis could only be verified by MRI.	0.9108744317202838
With a conservative treatment without resection of the ossification we could reach painless recovery.	0.9510298168158406
Hair problems are attacked at the levels of information supply, trichological competence and evidence based medical treatment.	0.7896862321222111
The alopecias represent a major health care challenge, and the psychological significance of hair loss has only recently found appreciation in the medical community.	1.2121490050734804
They may pose a vexing problem for non-specialized physicians, who tend to trivialize such complaints, although the patient's perception of abnormality determines whether or not advice is sought.	1.0488819664312792
Perception of a hair problem is subject to sociocultural standards; films and advertisements help determine the threshold for "normality" and what is "healthy" and "beautiful", and the media provide an abundance of undiscriminating information with respect to hair care.	1.0972032221888646
Patients with hair problems frequently consult the hairdresser prior to the medical specialist.	0.8628029576032937
Thus additional areas of competence should be incorporated into the hairdresser's training qualifications.	0.7761085494343758
Besides manual, creative and psychological aptitudes, "trichological competence" relating to the recognition of most important hair disorders, recognition of personal limitations and cooperation with the medical specialist are required.	1.0366647395942865
To optimize the interaction between the physician, hairdressers and the media, more effective communication and public activities from the medical profession are desirable, with success depending on full identification of the set goals, qualification and adherance to the standards determined by the medical speciality.	1.0717878330547468
We reexamined biopsy and resection specimens from seven patients with histologically established primary diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) which showed previously undetected adenocarcinomatous differentiation after chemotherapy.	0.9878091309963541
Adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in the same part of the lung as was SCLC before treatment in five cases and in contralateral location in two.	1.2005153542508047
Two tumors showed heterogeneous differentiation with small-cell and adenocarcinomatous components, and five had only adenocarcinoma.	1.1374176277011818
The interval between histological evidence of SCLC and adenocarcinoma was 3 months-5 years.	1.000360611129345
From the specific findings in the respective patients we can offer two possible explanations for changing differentiation in SCLC after chemotherapy: (a) a primarily heterogeneously differentiated tumor with selection of adenocarcinomatous component under chemotherapy, and (b) an independently developed adenocarcinoma after successful chemotherapy of SCLC, as patients with treated SCLC are known to have an increased risk of non-SCLC.	1.1210920567904281
However, therapy-induced alteration of differentiation seems much more unlikely.	1.206903139954234
These findings should be considered in diagnosis and therapy of SCLC to allow early and appropriate reaction to non-SCLC components.	1.03786491263949
Demonstration of BDV-specific serum antibodies, the isolation of BDV from cerebrospinal fluid of neuropsychiatric patients, and the recent demonstration of BDV antigen and BDV-RNA in human brain tissue strongly suggest that BDV can infect humans.	1.0907554004246547
Isolation of BD virus from brain tissue is needed for final proof.	0.7964292891600562
There is still great controversy about the question of whether BDV antigen, BDV-RNA or BDV can be detected in peripheral blood monocytes or not.	1.0335140273232999
Overall, the question of pathogenicity of BDV infection for humans is wide open.	0.9841641765690001
Investigations of human cerebrospinal fluid indicate that BDV might cause human lymphocytic meningoencephalitis and so-called symptomatic psychoses in rare cases.	0.7933983285527162
Seroepidemiological studies suggest a widely non-specific but possibly pathogenic role of BDV in a spectrum of psychiatric disorders.	0.9839592817987308
In a controlled prospective study we compared the efficacy of combined salt water bath and UVA/B phototherapy to a UVA/B mono-phototherapy in patients with subacute atopic dermatitis (AD).	0.9098655704867407
The patients in the balneophototherapy group (n=16) were treated with baths containing 3-5% of the synthetic salt Psori-sal, followed immediately by UVA/B irradiation, while the other treatment arm (n=12) received UVA/B phototherapy alone.	1.184838061264543
After 20 treatments the balneophototherapy group showed a statistically significant (p<=0.0015) reduction of the SCORAD score from 69.5 before to 36.8 after therapy.	1.040721056656576
No statistically significant reduction in the SCORAD score could be observed in the UVA/B phototherapy group (50.6 before to 44.3 after therapy).	1.1156250037937443
The cumulative UVB dose was significantly lower in the balneophototherapy group (0.9 J/cm2) as compared to the UVA/B monotherapy group (2.0 J/cm2).	1.1134215976950652
Balneophototherapy was well tolerated by patients with atopic dermatitis and no side effects were observed.	0.8662190987620929
We conclude that balneophototherapy expands the therapeutic options for patients with subacute atopic dermatitis.	1.0439828904965283
Five percent of all human tumors are found in the head and neck region with an increasing rate.	1.034069202379657
Head and neck tumors are not only a significant problem because of the large number of people affected.	1.3340924934185983
The functional and cosmetic disadvantages and stigmas related to the therapy influence the medical recommendations for each individual patient.	0.9411316136484296
Background and purpose: Only a few clinical reports about the routine use of intravenous rt-PA for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke have been published.	1.2562379896919935
Wether the perfusion of the extracranial parts of the internal carotid artery influences the outcome of the patients is still unknown, because the two major studies about systemic thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA in stroke (ECASS and NINDS) did not formally assess the status of the extracranial vessels.	1.1091385875031705
Introduction: Chronic pain is an individually variable experience, incorporating physical, psychological and social dimensions.	1.2376597828568532
Chronic pain occurs in a broad spectrum of severity; therefore, a grading procedure is of crucial importance in clinical research and in epidemiologic studies.	1.0426705418219941
It is mandatory to differentiate between traumatic and atraumatic instability when treating shoulder instability.	0.8297398924367223
The traumatic instability is characterized by secondary lesions (Bankart lesion, Hill-Sachs lesion, overstretching of the capsule), which are caused at the time of primary dislocation.	1.192241584444597
The quality of the capsule has to be considered in close relationship to the appearance of the Bankart lesion.	1.1521749900891674
The stronger the capsule, the greater the external force has to be in order to surmount the resistance caused by the capsule.	1.0865845444137672
The damage to the glenoid rim makes it possible to draw conclusions about the condition of the capsule.	0.9093130457717079
In cases of atraumatic instability, secondary lesions are normally absent.	0.8360826792520596
These instabilities are often caused by laxity of the capsule.	0.7151546865367834
When stabilizing, a shoulder two criteria have to be taken into consideration: stability and function.	1.014605717239828
Reattachment of the labrum alone will not guarantee stability.	0.821513974039205
Additionally, the overstretched capsule has to be shortened or shifted.	0.8816552351707228
Both criteria are decisive for the success of the stabilizing operation.	0.8156124289532124
In benign goiter, thyroidectomy is only indicated in patients with nodular alterations of the complete thyroid gland.	0.9286107133347429
There is no evidence indicating that total thyroidectomy could improve the postoperative results in patients with Graves' disease.	1.0790434796736443
In Germany, thyroidectomy with cervicocentral lymph node dissection is the standard procedure for all differentiated thyroid carcinomas.	0.9853352668421724
However, there are no data to prove that this approach is superior to less radical procedures.	1.2384620564354898
Avoidance of reoperations and optimal conditions for effective postoperative radioiodine therapy are arguments for this aggressive strategy.	0.8288310351878444
In patients with medullary carcinoma or with detected ret-proto-oncogene mutations, thyroidectomy with cervicocentral lymphadenectomy should be the initial operation.	0.8919196060705002
The cervicolateral and mediastinal compartments should be dissected when clinically obvious lymph node metastases are present in patients with differentiated carcinomas.	0.9091662282292533
In patients with medullary carcinomas, persistently increased calcitonin levels after the initial operation are sufficient indication for this procedure.	1.0020400107627856
Thyroidectomy is an important part of the multimodal approach in patients with anaplastic carcinomas.	0.9071420029542772
The operative technique of thyroidectomy is presented as well as the technique of cervical lymphadenectomy in consideration of the lymphatic drainage of the thyroid gland.	1.2288296975173216
Tyrosinemia type I is an autosomal recessively inherited deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase resulting in accumulation of tyrosin and its degradation products (succinylacetoacetone mainly).	0.8717695580356909
Typical clinical features include liver and kidney failure as well as central nervous system involvement.	1.0117621102312235
There are three main forms of the disease: the acute form with manifestation in newborn infants and the subacute and the chronic form in children older than one year of age.	1.0666556672867116
Experimental data and clinical as well as postmortem experiences have indicated that subdural hematomas are less frequent in acceleration injuries in traffic accidents compared to falls or assaults.	0.892292147628392
The present report demonstrates that this does not hold true in the same way for bridging vein ruptures (one of the predominant causes for subdural bleedings).	1.0636651600689746
Ruptures of these vessels without subdural bleeding (SDB) are only seldom mentioned in the literature.	0.9178592012900346
However, if no SDB is present, no one will look for these structures.	1.3706309900848899
In our institute a systematic analysis of the bridging veins in all cases of lethal blunt head injury is made: prior to the careful morphological preparation we investigate these vessels by radiographic imaging after filling with contrast medium.	0.9744873243290137
6 car passengers (age between 4 and 31 years) which suffered a lethal head injury were examined in the last year.	1.2507875964184207
2 victims had impressed fractures with cerebral compression injuries.	0.7115249698055097
In 1 case the base of the skull was broken and in 3 cases no skull fracture was present; no serious focal brain injury had occured in these 4 cases, but 3 victims had signs of diffuse brain injury.	1.168184498524897
In 5 cases a direct impact of the head against the interior of the car was obvious.	1.1766031683838059
In 5 cases ruptures of serveral bridging veins could be demonstrated.	0.8083389276936574
In one case (survival for 3 days) a minor SDB (20 ml) was present and the ruptures had been closed by thrombosis; another victim died at the scene.	1.2952756259507712
The other 3 victims survived between 4 and 15 hours without developing SDB and without closing of the ruptures by thrombosis.	0.8943106496932358
This combination is surprising and shows that our knowledge concerning the relationship between bridging vein ruptures and SDB is restrictred.	0.8789419641463694
The frequency of bridging vein lesions in severe head injuries is likely underestimated in the clinical as well as in the postmortem literature.	1.0738002077426165
A rapid increase of intracranial pressure after the accident resulting in a collapse of the cerebral circulation is probably responsible for the absence of the SDB in the presented cases.	1.1373967619969074
Implantable hearing aids can form the basis of new surgical techniques for dealing with hearing problems originating in the inner ear, provided they are fully implantable.	1.0191059793681108
Accordingly, a comprehensive, interdisciplinary, combined project was initiated at the ENT clinic of the University of Tübingen which was to conclude with operations to improve hearing via fully implantable hearing aids.	1.0984268554651848
A novel electromechanical transducer for implantable hearing aids based on the piezoelectric principle is described.	0.888074577039967
Unlike the piezoelectric transducers reported so far, this transducer does not rely on the bimorphic principle but on a circle-shaped, heteromorphic combination system consisting of a piezoceramic disc and metal membrane.	0.9062857758190161
The transducer can be hermetically sealed and is designed for implantation into the mastoid.	0.7827765436124409
Transfer of mechanical oscillations to an ossicle in the middle ear is effected by a directly fixed coupling rod or via suitable coupling elements.	0.8948603259247361
The transducer is highly tuned with a resonance frequency at the upper end of the spectral transfer range (greater than 10 kHz).	0.9945980050405949
Below this resonance and down to low frequencies, the frequency response of elongation is smooth with amplitudes of around 20 nm.	1.0183729790648335
At low and middle frequencies of up to 1 kHz, these vibration amplitudes correspond to sound-pressure levels of around 90 dB SPL.	0.9290939620042816
At higher frequencies of up to 10 kHz, the output level increases to about 130 dB SPL.	1.0061479064995305
Nonlinear distortions are also very small at the highest levels (less than 0.1%) throughout the whole transfer range.	1.0160013451779437
Electric power consumption at maximum levels is in the range of a few microwatts and is therefore significantly lower than that of electromagnetic systems.	1.0666306072136298
Particularly, this makes it possible to use the transducer in fully implantable hearing aids for rehabilitation of sensorineural hearing loss.	1.0080110752184428
In craniomaxillofacial traumatology, surgical oncology and craniomaxillofacial reconstruction, a surgeon's aim may interfere with the prechiasmatic visual pathway.	0.9845548665219325
Precise concepts and therapeutic strategies are mandatory to detect and deal with anterior visual pathway disorders.	0.9810598608208693
In order to develop these strategies, knowledge of the pathomechanisms of potential optic nerve trauma, primary radiological investigations, and further diagnostic measures are important.	1.0995164493644367
Due to the difficulties in neuroophthalmological testing of visual pathway functioning in severely injured patients or even during craniomaxillofacial reconstructions, we established flash-evoked visual potentials (VEP) and the electroretinogram (ERG) as reliable electrophysiological methods to gather specific information as to whether the visual pathway function is intact, even if pathological, but still present or absent.	1.1972032045223318
Case reports show that subjectively or objectively confirmed unilateral amaurosis does not neccessarily mean irreversible vision loss.	0.696526636958789
The electrophysiological evaluation together with multiplanar computer tomography (CT) are important for the immediate identification of optic nerve trauma.	1.0368352187083625
The results of this evaluation will provide the diagnostic information on whether surgical intervention and/or conservative therapy is required to prevent secondary optic nerve damage.	1.177590383243069
The conservative therapy of choice for the treatment of traumatic optic nerve lesions is the methylprednisolone-megadosis regimen (30 mg Urbason/kg bodyweight i.v.	1.0301010796671815
and 5.4 mg/kg bodyweight/h i.v.	1.0788196251674342
for the following 47 h).	0.683696449397636
Surgical therapy involves decompression of the orbital compartment in case of retrobulbar hematoma or decompression of the intracanalicular part of the optic nerve in the traumatized optic canal or posterior orbit as confirmed by CT.	0.91715455027169
Prospective analysis of our trauma patients and the international literature on traumatic optic nerve lesions show that the time factor in when to start therapy has been greatly underestimated.	1.1725716825933914
To fulfill modern treatment concepts in craniomaxillofacial surgery, sound diagnostic and therapeutic knowledge on the maintenance of visual pathway function is required.	0.9713280272653219
In the presence of preterm labor, premature rupture of the membranes, and preterm maturation of the cervix, there is an increased risk for premature birth.	1.1671938496958194
There is a combination of endocrine as well as paracrine regulations which are responsible for the events associated with preterm labor, maturation of the cervix, and preterm rupture of the membranes.	1.0713897520374804
Apart from classical hormones, various pro-inflammatory cytokines act as mediators.	0.8549184416172337
At the fetal-maternal interface - which is formed by the placenta with the chorioamnion on the fetal side and the decidua, myometrium, and the cervix on the maternal side - an intense interaction between endocrine and immunological reactions has been observed.	1.2256966758757917
Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a hormone with multiple functions in humans, produced by the pineal gland and stimulated by -adrenergic receptors.	1.1925813011339923
Serum melatonin levels exhibit a circadian rhythm with low levels during the day, rise in the evening and maximum levels at night between 2 and 4 a.m.. Melatonin participates in the regulation of several physiological processes such as seasonal biological rhythm, daily sleep induction, aging and modulation of immunobiological defence reactions.	0.9494943982446677
Furthermore, melatonin has a highly lipophilic molecular structure facilitating penetration of cell membranes and serving as an extra- and intracellular free radical scavenger.	1.0819689315407837
Melatonin seems to quench mainly hydroxyl radicals, the most damaging of all free radicals.	1.0412844469256015
Melatonin may play a role in the etiology and treatment of several dermatoses e.g.	0.9345125272740935
atopic eczema, psoriasis and malignant melanoma.	0.7162474194218674
The influence of melatonin on hair growth is another aspect.	0.830553481289471
Topical application of melatonin inhibits the development of UV-erythema.	0.8490534176953334
Penetration through skin after topical application and oral bioavailability auxit further investigations on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic actions of melatonin.	0.8209540902663454
Lung dust analyses were performed on tumor-free lung tissue from surgical samples of 28 carcinoid tumors.	0.9824177803626061
The measured levels in one surgical sample may easily be correlated with the increased asbestos load of the lung due to the patients' occupation as stone mason.	1.0521035004409227
No evidence supporting the correlation of increased chronic asbestos load of the lungs and the development of typical carcinoid tumors of the lung was found.	1.0163457390836572
Analysis of 147 repeat arthroscopies of the knee performed at the Department of Surgery at the Herz-Jesu Krankenhaus, Fulda, from 1990 to 1995, showed that meniscal lesions were the most common (n = 89, 60.5%).	1.1719595627201793
The majority of meniscal lesions (n = 45, 50.6%) occurred in menisci that had already been partially resected.	1.258492634354729
The most common localization was the posterior third of the medial meniscus in ipsilateral lesions.	1.1270493567994804
Conversely, contralateral meniscal injuries were only documented in 18 cases (20.2%), while de-novo lesions occurred in 29 cases (29.2%).	1.1419103560745227
A coincidence of meniscal injury with first- or second-grade cartilage damage was documented  in 35 patients (39.3%), whereas 54 patients (60.7%) had normal intra-articular cartilage.	1.2892766267989122
Cartilage damage was most frequent in patients who had previously undergone partial meniscectomy.	1.1016406607975704
The most common therapeutic consequences were partial meniscectomy and cartilage-shaving.	0.9757660517334894
Concerning patients' postoperative satisfaction and evaluation of the results by OAK score, the majority of patients attained significant improvement in function (65.2%) and showed good or excellent outcome in the OAK score (88.8%).	1.1490635155496383
Patients without accompanying cartilage damage had better results in comparison to patients with cartilage damage in the affected area (p < 0.05).	0.812876022855154
In conclusion, in patients with positive meniscal signs and a history of previous meniscal surgery, repeat arthroscopy is generally and early indicated and can be recommended as a valid method to assess cartilage damage objectively.	1.1416261915503647
However, patients with cartilage damage do not have the same benefit.	1.2885567567173244
The present study examined the effectiveness of combined dermatological and behavioural medicine therapy on the skin status and disease-specific stress of eighty-six patients with psoriasis and fifty-eight patients with atopic dermatitis who were hospitalized in the PsoriSol Clinic, Hersbruck, Germany.	1.1079723479388361
In addition to receiving instruction about their stain disease, the patients were offered, practice in relaxation techniques, social contacts and scratching control as well as individual psychological counselling.	1.1603327672443091
The clinical change was assessed by PASI and SCORAD, respectively.	0.7246905116912827
The Marburg questionnaire for coping with skin diseases (MHF) and a questionnaire for health-related control attributes (GKÜ-S) served as psychometric measures.	1.088103029589023
Patients showed significant improvement in skin status and psychosocial parameters in pre-post comparison.	0.8321707219726578
Social fears, avoidance and helplessness were reduced by significant improvement of the emotional status in both groups.	0.9042672354111769
Patients with psoriasis also showed an increase in internal control attributes.	0.8979788162864505
Dermatological treatment combined with behavioural medicine therapy can be considered an effective method in patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.	0.9714106639413186
Treatment of chronic cancer pain with strong opioids is indicated in about 60-70 % of patients.	1.137642071431278
Surprisingly, these very potent analgesics are prescribed with great reservations in many countries, including Germany.	1.1291844666712443
The aim of our investigation was to analyse the supply of opioid analgesics to outpatients with cancer pain in the region of Hannover, which has about 1.1 million inhabitants.	1.3695730019440635
In Germany special prescription forms, i. e. triplicate forms, have to be used for the prescription of strong opioids.	0.9591440871783717
At the time when our investigation took place prescriptions for outpatients had to be renewed every 7 days.	0.944299904435546
For two observation periods of 6 months lasting from January to June 1988 and from January to June 1991 all of the opioid prescription forms that had been issued by general practitioners for clients of the AOK Hannover (one of the major medical insurance companies) were evaluated.	1.1326266836666643
The reasons for prescribing opioids were analysed by recording the diagnosis.	0.8969246527285547
The individual treatment period on an outpatient basis during these 6 months was determined, excluding, e. g. days of hospitalization.	1.0365367886198502
During the two observation periods only 16.2 % (1988) and 19.5 % (1991) of the practitioners in the region of Hannover prescribed strong opioids to outpatients.	1.1779078496761433
The majority of the practitioners consisted of general practitioners and specialists in internal medicine.	1.0483682137445842
Although these two groups mainly function as family doctors who are responsible for the basic therapeutical needs of their patients, only 22.6-33.8 % of these doctors prescribed opioids to outpatients.	1.1764296972823989
In two-thirds of the patients, cancer pain was the reason for prescribing the drug.	0.8706726137719959
The total number of patients with a prescription for cancer pain was 164 in 1988 and 196 in 1991.	0.9562471103508831
Altogether 1002 prescription forms in 1988 and 1065 prescription forms in 1991 had been issued for these patients.	0.8072828768675754
Applied to the individual treatment period as an outpatient, only 36.0 % of the patients in 1988 and 32.1 % in 1991 received a regular prescription of strong opioids every 7 days.	1.2806558386603917
The mean time interval between separate prescriptions was 16.8  +/-  25.4 days in 1988 and 19.4  +/-  29.1 days in 1991.	1.2354311692714728
Accordingly, the majority of patients with chronic cancer pain had been supplied with opioids only occasionally.	1.1210918542678117
Our data indicate a significant undertreatment of outpatients suffering from cancer pain.	0.7974922717375384
Taking into account the estimated total number of patients suffering from cancer, only 14.5 % (1988) and 19.0 % (1991) of all outpatients in need of strong opioids were supplied sufficiently with those analgesics.	1.254070460978966
Comparing the results from the observation period in 1988 with the results from 1991 it becomes obvious that the situation has not changed.	1.1277532735457256
There are different reasons for the insufficiency of opioid treatment: many physicians as well as their patients are still afraid of the side effects of strong opioids.	1.0882819974246618
Therefore, it is necessary to improve education concerning this issue.	1.1181325312872845
The legal restrictions on the use of narcotics and their complexity are another important reason for doctors not to prescribe strong opioids.	0.8308310241929774
In 1993 the regulations were simplified; nevertheless, this has not led to a profound change in the attitude of the prescribing practitioners.	1.0967079572279599
Thus, further changes in legislation seem to be necessary so that the requirements for the prescription of strong opioids do not differ from other drugs.	1.1796351324363326
The long-term functional results of acetabular fractures are assessed in terms of the corresponding criteria of Merle-D'Aubigné and Postel (pain, mobility, walking).	0.9343903682962841
Other essential criteria include the quality of reduction and the radiological appearance.	1.0382413041432157
A 53 year old female patient developed a keratoacanthoma, present on the left side of her nose for two months.	1.158497931912976
After repeated unsuccessful trials with cryotherapy, she was treated with intralesional injection of methotrexate performed twice with a weekly internal.	0.9215219801713335
This led to complete resolution within 5 weeks.	0.8408661119135566
Although controlled studies on the effect of methotrexate in keratoacanthoma are not available, the rapid regression and the good cosmetic result suggest that this therapy may play a beneficial role in treating these lesions especially in problem locations.	1.0858642662797144
Between January 1995 and June 1996, 24 inpatients at our hospital (mean age 55.6 years) were treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).	1.108088018598954
Clinical improvement was observed in 80% of the patients, including those without risk factors (NRG, n=16), as well as those with concomitant cardiovascular diseases (RG, n=8).	1.0723458028986195
During a mean period of observation of 224 days after the end of ECT 7 patients (35%) relapsed.	1.1292779683812817
The rate of relapse was higher in RG than in NRG patients (57.1 vs 23.1%).	0.9851394974262049
In all cases ECT was well tolerated; 285 applications of ECT did not result in mortality or persistent morbidity.	0.9301064094117389
However, RG patients may be at increased risk for the development of minor cardiovascular complications, which were noted in three RG patients (37.5%), but only in one patient (6.2%) in the NRG (Fisher's test, P=0.09).	1.3491113138619435
Taken together, our results demonstrate that ECT is a safe treatment regimen for depression even in medically ill patients of old age.	0.997642666213296
On 21.11.1811 the poet Heinrich von Kleist and his companion Henriette Vogel were found dead in a small hollow by the Wannsee.	0.8748078877440484
The autopsy revealed that Kleist was shot in the mouth and Vogel died from a close-contact shot to the chest.	0.8930143154002963
The tragedy, which was reflected in letters and documents ended in a suicide pact.	1.0395723743168743
The conclusions of the pathologists were influenced by current medical opinions which were based on interpretations of the ancient humoral doctrine of Hypocrates.	0.800130606256285
Subjective and objective opinions were mixed together.	0.6399483918135978
Some forensic and historical aspects of this suicide pact are highlighted.	0.7951863119566372
There is no doubt that a single emergency phone number is desirable, but in contrast to other countries, in Germany different emergency phone numbers and dispatching centers exist for the fire brigade (FB), the emergency medical service system (EMS), and the general practitioners' emergency service (GPS).	1.278751405854363
Due to this fact, valuable time is often wasted by connecting or transferring emergency calls from one dispatching center to another.	0.7739334796648717
The purpose of this study was to analyse all calls received by the different dispatching centers in the city and county area of Mainz with respect to total number, fraction of emergency calls, and specificity.	1.0928229638480425
Further, the total number of calls potentially referring to a hypothetic single dispatching center with a general emergency phone number (112) was calculated.	1.1086795572393422
During a 4-month period, all telephone calls were registered and related to day, time, and origin of the call (city or county) and classified as non-urgent or emergency calls, calls appropriate to the dispatching center dialed, emergency calls to be transferred, or unspecific calls.	1.1067844570684653
A total of 80 987 calls were received (city area 84.3%, county area 15.7%), most of them directed to the FB of Mainz (33 086).	1.2008935260515259
The EMS dispatching center received 31 286 calls, the five GPS-centers 15 256 calls; 1359 emergency calls that were directed to the police or FB needed transfer to the EMS.	0.9052716139047167
During weekdays the EMS and FB received the most calls, with a reduced frequency on Saturdays and Sundays (Table 2).	1.0087045792394063
Nevertheless, the highest total numbers of calls were received on Saturdays due to multiple calls directed to the GPS.	0.9750963147724231
The FB had the highest specificity of calls; more than 50% of the calls to the GPS were unspecific (Fig.	1.0193061380177206
Of all calls, 4.37% were classified as emergency calls; two-thirds of these came from the area of Mainz during the daytime.	1.0678584300590686
During off-duty hours of the GPS in the city, 51% of the emergency calls reached the EMS directly; 49% had to be connected by the police or FB.	1.2083381461886902
During duty hours of the GPS, the fraction of calls directed to the EMS decreased significantly to 35%.	0.9800853378072361
During duty hours of the GPS centers in the county area, only 14% of the urgent emergency calls reached the EMS dispatcher directly (Fig.	1.0133781007903409
Compared to the multiple-center mode, a hypothetic single dispatching center for all systems would probably be followed by a slight increase in total number of calls due to the fact that the GPS numbers would be answered 24 h a day, but there would be only minimal differences in the total number received on most days; only on Sundays would a decrease be expected.	1.1133623018636312
The EMS area of Mainz, with a total of 13 different telephone numbers for 7 dispatching centers, can be regarded as typical of the German situation.	1.215287913516699
The high number of emergency calls to be transferred (up to 86% under special circumstances) demonstrated that this weak point in the German EMS system must be eliminated by introducing a single emergency number.	1.040988039595137
This should occur when a Europe-wide three-digit number "112" will be instituted, probably in 1995.	0.9420989944748988
Additionally, the continued existence of 5- or 10-digit telephone numbers for non-urgent calls may be useful for allowing non-verbal differentiation of calls.	1.1176093654101102
In any case, all telephone numbers, including the latter calls, have to enter one dispatching center.	1.2312846302909612
The main advantage of a single dispatching center would be avoidance of the time-consuming transfer of emergency calls from one dispatching center to the other.	1.0109166555377278
In addition to elevated intraocular pressure, a compromised ocular blood supply has been implicated in the pathogenesis of primary open-angle glaucoma (PCOG).	0.971401167662497
The ongoing change of demographic and economic structures does not undermine employment (as many believe), but this change indeed induces problems with the mandatory old-age security system in Germany.	1.1179419617218755
This paper discusses some popular reform proposals and concludes with another proposal which takes into account economic incentives.	0.8192909722177633
Especially the gerontological aim of a longer lifetime employment is adressed.	0.8034459006668996
Epidemiologic data suggest that an underlying genetic disposition can be detected in up to 10 % of all colorectal cancer patients and autosomal dominantly inherited hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is the entity most frequently identified.	1.2388412795184647
It was described first by A. Warthin in 1895 in "Family G" and is characterized by a predisposition to an early onset of colorectal cancer and other intestinal or genitourinary tumors.	1.094170811956216
We report the case of a 61-year-old woman with five different cancers.	0.924533227042158
Although the strict Amsterdam Criteria were not fulfilled, molecular analysis revealed HNPCC; further genetic testing in the family confirmed that the 36-year-old and so far healthy son had inherited the germline mutation of his affected mother.	1.055948521529687
Genetic testing in clinically suspected HNPCC cases is recommended for patients with colorectal cancer meeting the Amsterdam Criteria.	1.0101565559811838
In patients meeting one of Bethesda Criteria 2-7 without meeting the Amsterdam Criteria, germline mutation analysis is recommended only in MSI-positive tumors.	0.9002182761519966
Introduction: The Pura-Vario stent features 2 newly designed "bridging segments" for enhanced longitudinal flexibility, in order to allow easier and safer stent implantation.	0.9736520499128022
The median palatine suture has long been regarded as having the greatest resistance to dilatation of the maxilla.	0.8194034200352398
In 1984 Glassman [3] presented a conservative-surgical method of division of the palatineal suture in which only the lateral and anterior support of the maxilla is debilitated surgically.	0.9969484740730128
An orthodontic apparatus cemented in place preoperatively is already used intraoperatively for dilatation of the maxilla.	0.7803403675021469
In the period from 1991 to 1997, 16 patients with a leptomaxilla and various dysnathic findings have been operated on at our clinic by the method described by Glassman [3].	1.093141040502784
Sometimes the maxilla was dilated intraoperatively using the apparatus cemented in place by the method of Derichsweiler and dilatation was continued postoperatively until the described result was achieved.	0.9908456855228289
After successful dilatation of the maxilla and a stabilizing phase, a mono- or bimaxillary operation was performed.	1.1560105044849112
The use of this method led to the desired result in 15 patients.	1.1185064240677536
Dilatation of the maxilla was objectivized by determining the pre- and postoperative width of the anterior and posterior dental arch using models and X-ray of the occlusal overlay of the maxilla.	1.0827838428238197
In one patient who was operated on at the age of 38 years, a fracture of the alveolar process of the maxilla occurred unilaterally due to the completed ossification of the median palatine suture.	1.2644390025647816
The method of surgically aided dilatation of the maxilla at the level of Le Fort I plane is suitable for patients up to the age of 30.	1.0273749052222891
In older patients, the median palatine suture should be transsected as well.	0.9314235431284078
Osteoarthritis is the most common joint disease.	1.0698078043315256
In addition to known risk factors e.g.	0.7915006652619068
genetics, age and hormonal status it has been suggested that chronic-repetitive micro- and substantial (macro-) injury may play an important pathogenetic role.	1.24871603175161

Pathogenesis: Arteriosclerosis and Mönckeberg's disease mediasclerosis are vascular diseases associated with calcification of the artery wall.	0.821658194481306
While mediasclerosis in most cases develops in type 2 diabetic patients, arteriosclerosis is the result of a combination of different vascular risk factors.	1.0073852303359934
Möncheberg's mediasclerosis typically involves the tunica media, whereas arteriosclerosis-associated calcifications primarily involve the intima.	0.8931670755257096

Diseases included pleomorphic adenoma, cystadenolymphoma, carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma, ductal carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, lymphoepithelial carcinoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, sialolithiasis, sialadenitis, Heerfordt's syndrome and congenital duct ectasies.	0.8748189808316192
In addition to the usually performed T1 and T2 cross-sectional sequences a heavily weighted T2 sequence (TR 3600, TE 800) was performed and allowed depiction of a fluid-filled parotid duct.	1.0586074765869644
Results showed that the main parotid and primary branching ducts were depicted reliably in all normal cases and all patients, except one with sicca syndrome.	0.9875298155414013
Pathological conditions such as duct dilatations, duct strictures, obstructing duct calculus and irregular shapes and courses of the ductal system were demonstrable.	0.7548648347235561
While X-ray sialography obtained a higher resolution, only MR sialography was able to depict dilated ducts proximal from a complete obstruction, as well as all ductal cysts.	0.9835384760112194
Our findings show that MR sialography can be applied successfully to investigations of the parotid gland system.	0.9240804342192247
There have been no contraindications or complications to date because MR sialography is non-invasive.	0.9236629683562319
The technique will also allow the salivary ducts and lesions to be differentiated from the course of the facial nerve.	0.9286750517748926
Substantial improvement in conformal radiotherapy is possible using modulated irradiation fields.	0.7768676590994018
Such modulated fields may be generated even with conventional accelerators by means of individual metal compensators or with the recently available dynamic multileaf collimators (MLC).	0.8552881082241295
For treatment planning a new kind of planning program is required that can calculate the 2 D-intensity matrices for each photon field.	0.9120982735197396
At the German Cancer Research Center (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum) such a program has been developed under the name of "KonRad" (Conformal Radiotherapy).	1.074486560027983
Although it is an independent application, it is proposed for clinical usage to supplement a planning system that is already present.	1.1767128051079028
So-called inverse planning differs from conventional 3 D planning, as the trial-and-error approach for finding good field parameters is nearly completely avoided.	0.9971284457259368
Instead, the radio-oncologist is given the chance directly to specify medically oriented criteria like the prescription dose in the target volume, maximal tolerance dose values for each organ at risk and their weighting factors.	1.0549775114517859
In addition, the so-called DVH optimization allows aimed, partial overdosage, especially in parallelly structured organs in order to obtain better overall planning results.	1.0734305450573267
The Problem Six-year old boy with unilateral Type-II cleftfoot, oligodactyly and clinodactyly of the 2nd toe.	1.027984113523479
The marked splaying of the forefoot not only causes painful pressure points but also problems with fitting of shoes.	0.894487398750307
A child with typical signs of the cat eye-syndrom except the characteristic feature of a cat eye is reported.	0.8587050147209987
In a chromosome analysis (47,xx, + mar de novo) an extrachromosome was detected.	0.8609807603688416
Using fluorescence in situ hybridization the supernumerary marker refered to chromosome 22.	0.7580263282048253
In the literature only a few cases show all the characteristic features of cat eye syndrome.	1.171462343416673
However, there are only two case reports of children without any ocular alterations.	1.3217582380144945
The great variability in the phenotype probably depends on different sizes of the marker chromosome or asymmetric breakpoints on the long arm of chromosome 22.	0.8449844079131223
According to new literature reports there is no correlation between the phenotypic variability and the size of the marker chromosome.	0.9490701550561966
Probably the degree of severity is correlated with the percentage of the patients lymphocytes that contain the extrachromosome.	1.0809359342678686
Introduction: Children with ALL frequently present with skeletal pain at the time of diagnosis.	1.1141477471813073
We retrospectively analyzed the incidence and clinical features of skeletal pain and the correlation between pain and radiographic findings.	1.1246871063714932
Objective: Elevated levels of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) have been reported after cardiac operation, during inflammatory process and cardiac allograft rejection.	1.2285583173251677
Although several groups proved the evidence of a negative inotropic effect, the actual mechanism is not completely understood.	1.088216023407448
Speaking generally it is possible that low molecular weight proteins are capable of altering myocardial contractility on the level of the contractile apparatus.	0.8604678467348115
Therefore this study analyzes whether IL-1 and/or IL-6 influence myocardial contractility on the level of the contractile apparatus.	0.9015646319937355
Methods: During aorto-coronary bypass operation, human muscle fibers were excised (n=32) and skinned using Triton-X-100.	1.1068251929305546
The experimental skinned fiber model excludes membrane-related factors such as receptor activation and provides direct examination of the contractile apparatus itself.	0.8767799264969595
Different concentrations of IL-1 and IL-6 were applied (pIL-1/IL-6 1-2x10-5-10-11M).	0.9027904485416587
Force generation, calcium sensitivity, and velocity of force generation and relaxation were measured.	0.9828089698637571
(Experiments were carried out at optimal length, bath temperature 23 °C, and isometric conditions.)	0.8854833387696192
Results: None of the skinned muscle preparations of the human myocardium showed under the given experimental setup a significant change in contractility and relaxation after exposure to IL-1 and IL-6.	1.0040124317741803
Despite using nonphysiologic concentrations of IL-1 and IL-6 (pIL-1/IL-6 10-5M) no significant effect occurred.	0.9280043585628248
Furthermore no difference in calcium-sensitivity of the contractile proteins following addition of IL-1 and IL-6 could be observed.	1.0001479876899964
Conclusions: Thus, there is no experimental evidence for direct modulation of the contractile apparatus by IL-1 or IL-6.	1.2853315384343402
Given these results it is possible to exclude some potentially negative inotropic cascades that are mediated on the level of the contractile apparatus as the molecular mechanism.	1.0314056537314902
These data show that therapies which support myocardial contractility during sepsis by stimulation of the contractile proteins do not seem to be very promising.	0.9521428236901904
Indications for intercarpal and radiocarpal resectionarthroplasty and fusions are osteoarthritis, KIEHNBÖCK'S disease, rheumatoid arthritis and several posttraumatic disorders of the wrist joint.	0.731919273908067
The resection of carpal bones leads to severe instability patterns of the wrist.	0.8702489679890678
In conclusion we recommend resection-arthroplasty just for treatment of the thumb carpo-metacarpal osteoarthritis.	0.9751100089188847
Implant resection arthroplasty of the lunate and scaphoid or total wrist implants are still causing multiple problems regarding heavy load.	0.9723521881690089
Therefore this implants should be confined to rheumatoid patients.	0.5631227448608215
Of the limited carpal arthrodeses the scaphotrapezium-trapezoid arthrodeses is the most frequent performed procedure.	0.907408261616578
It can be indicated for STT-osteoarthritis, KIEHNBÖCK's disease, scapho-lunate instability and scaphoid pseudarthrosis if other surgical procedures had failed presuming there are no signs of arthrosis in the radiocarpal joint.	0.9483861491683843
Persisting pain especially in heavy work is quite frequent after limited arthrodesis but can be greatly releaved by simultaneous wrist denervation.	0.8245797739586945
In advanced cases of osteoarthritis total wrist arthrodesis is still the best choice for the patient.	1.0809778260134786
Increasing numbers of monitors at the anaesthesiologist's workplace, providing more than 20 different parameters of the patient's condition, have already made it impossible to record all the values in a handwritten form.	1.139236493535804
Consequently, this most common method of record-keeping must be incomplete and inaccurate.	1.0295113085819434
In recent years computerised data-acquisition systems have been introduced into clinical practice in order to produce more reliable records.	1.038945694211
But after a 7-year experience in the use of such a system in cardiac anaesthesia, we have recognised certain problems that remain to be solved before automated record-keeping will achieve wider acceptance.	1.1217396134395783
The first is the handling problem, which was discussed in a previous paper [11].	1.0067707430254553
The second major problem is the appearance of artifacts, caused mainly by mechanical manipulations during the operation.	0.9508241614635553
In this paper, 300 courses of anaesthesia that were recorded on-line during different cardiac surgery procedures were examined and the incidence as well as the kind of artifacts occurring were evaluated.	1.1536974383642251
Algorithms were developed for each haemodynamic parameter to suppress these artifacts automatically by a subsequent analysing process; the efficiency of that "artifact filter" was validated in 35 of the 300 cases.	0.9948889718457463
Based on more than 30,000 values for each parameter, the incidence of artifacts was 3%-7%.	1.3361710354464813
However, only 0.1%-0.5% of the artifacts could not be eliminated by the filter.	1.3454960992925808
The method described here provided acceptable graphic printouts of the most important haemodynamic parameters (Figs.	0.9104984738619252
1b and 2b) and would also be suitable to serve as an input filter for automatically running anaesthesia data-examination processes, which are currently being developed in our clinic.	1.1546356889250364
Extracorporal shock wave application (ESWA) has been used in the treatment of stones located in kidneys, bile, pancreas and the glandula parotis.	0.7059774830682316
In the last 2 years several studies have shown the benefit of the ESWA on the treatment of soft tissue disorders.	0.9431986516145119
The aim of this study was to explore the effect of high energy extracorporal shock waves in patients with painful calcaneus spurs.	0.9769094460778133
83 patients who underwent medicophysical treatment without benefit were treated with 3000 impulses of 0,30 mJ/mm2.	0.942395840793881
Follow-ups after 12 weeks and 12 months showed that 51 of 83 patients became pain-free and 20 patients improved from the treatment.	1.143904555785224
The results are showing the benefit of the high energy extracorporal shock wave application in the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis.	1.3262055215847641
In developed countries, medical conditions, rather than lack of food, are the main contributors to malnutrition.	1.0641372841091723
Undernutrition is especially common in older persons, occuring in 5-12 % of community-dwelling older persons, in 30-61 % of hospitalized older persons, and in 40-85 % of persons in long-term care institutions.	1.4241325083918424
The multi-factorial nature of undernutrition in the elderly forces a structured differential diagnostic approach to determine underlying causes.	1.00091350677443
Heightened physician awareness of nutritional problems and prompt risk assessment is imperative to prevent the sequalae of undernutrition.	0.879360226278889
This structured approach to the differential diagnosis is essential to evaluate potentially reversible causes of malnutrition.	1.1399478288274931
The number of surgical procedures performed as day surgery has significantly increased in recent years.	0.9880092149116201
Therefore, a safe and short postoperative recovery period has become increasingly important.	1.2349043275614575
The aim of the present study was to investigate perioperative cognitive and physiological function after oral premedication with low-dose midazolam (3.75 mg), especially during the postoperative period.	1.3561477352677571
Heart failure may be defined as a reduced physical per-formance frequently caused by a defect in myocardial contraction.	0.9947281302856293
According to the New York Heart Association, the severity of heart failure is classified into four grades (NYHA I-IV).	1.0788601282101111
Predominantly underlying causes are coronary artery disease, hypertension, cardiomyopathies and valvular heart diseases.	0.7512990267406219
Psychic disorders were studied with a naturalistic design in 125 consecutive patients of a medical-geriatric department in a general hospital.	1.0581545205391631
Based on the clinical examination and the values of the Mini-Mental-State-Examination (2), 51 patients were classified as unable for diagnostic procedures concerning psychic state.	1.1342415799902044
The other 74 patients underwent these diagnostic procedures including clinical investigation and three screening-scales (Geriatric Depression Scale (11); Hospital Anxiety and Depression-Scale (4)).	0.9771258124763047
If these examinations led to the suspicion that a patient suffered from a psychic disorder, an interview was performed by a psychotherapist with experience in gerontopsychosomatic treatment and information was collected from the medical and nursing staff.	1.162938643002597
Dementia was detected or excluded by neuropsychological tests.	0.6930234261518243
Psychic disorders were found in 41 patients, mostly adaptation disorders and depressions, the disorder was estimated to be relevant for the whole hospital therapy.	1.1853018480324717
The screening instruments turned out to be reliable, so they can be recommended for further use.	1.1754858749150363
Difficult to answer remains the question, how the treatment of the psychic disorders - in our sample necessary for each 5th to 6th patient - can be implemented in a medical-geriatric department.	1.279590717395821
Based on the "Trauma Registry" of the German Society of Trauma Surgery, an interclinical quality management (QM) system was implemented.	1.237616225316556
The principles of the QM system as well as the differences in the quality of outcome and treatment are presented.	1.1850159666396902
The analysis uses the data on 2,069 severely injured (ISS = 22  +/-  14) patients from 20 hospitals collected prospectively and anonymously between 2/93 and 12/97.	1.1142980791173107
Outcome quality was analyzed by the TRISS method and Z-statistics.	0.8251653852910585
The Z-value of the whole series was -0.24.	1.1096023278033889
There were three hospitals with more than 150 patients that had a Ps value calculated by the TRISS method.	0.9861472478150104
Clinic A had a good (-2.49), clinic B an average (-0.3) and clinic C (3.62) an adverse Z-value.	1.4136689622868053
The assessment of treatment quality was performed by criteria concerning both preclinical and acute clinical phases.	1.012810600112326
Clinic C had a prolonged preclinical treatment time (90 min vs 62 min in clinic A) for severely injured (ISS > 15) patients.	1.0674783256571823
At the same time, the preclinical intubation rate for severe thoracic trauma (AIS > 3) was lower (44 %) in clinic C than in A (62 %).	1.1888573427355411
With 14 min clinic A had the shortest time until basic radiological and ultrasound diagnostics were completed (X-rays of chest and pelvis and abdominal ultrasound) in cases of severe blunt trauma (ISS > 15), compared to 54 min in clinic B or 31 min in clinic C. Also, cranial computed tomography for severe traumatic brain injury (GCS < 9) was applied significantly faster in clinic A (after 36 min) than in clinic C (after 62 min).	1.2394538111094737
Delayed diagnoses were defined as the difference between the ISS at discharge and the ISS at completion of diagnostics in the emergency department; this criterion was met best by clinic A with an ISS difference of two patients compared to five in clinic B and four in clinic C.	1.0893801621522712
For invasive catheter procedures both ionic and nonionic contrast media (CM) with excellent tolerability are available.	0.9538021922027831
The governing practical factors for CM are X-ray opacity and biocompatibility.	0.8143653872326405
Tolerability of a contrast medium is governed among its physical properties by its viscosity, osmolality, and ionic concentration.	0.982283405174342
In Germany the nonionic CM are currently preferred.	0.7967234788015038
Because of its low thrombotic complications, the ionic CM Ioxaglat is an important alternative in high risk interventions.	1.1133261844115947
In patients with known CM incompatibility, the prophylactic application of H1-receptor antagonists and corticosteroids allows catheterization safely without complications.	1.0000317343135217
In impaired renal function, hydration is the most effective prophylactic measure to be taken.	1.119541159575467
Background: In the present study we evaluated the influence of topical miotics on intraocular pressure and the blood-aqueous barrier after uncomplicated phacoemulsification and PC-IOL implantation.	1.1303817808281198
A judgement on the patient's quality of life cannot be based solely on the information about the clinical severity of a disease.	1.1068060498163141
Very often there is no correlation between these parameters.	0.9024953549099752
It is necessary to assess the quality of life by a health status question-naire since non-life threatening diseases common in dermatology influence the quality of life very much.	0.9891971957601182
The most frequently used questionnaires are the SF-36 and the Nottingham Health Profile.	0.913785994911516
However, these forms do not evaluate all dermatologic patients adequately.	1.1424179570268
Therefore specific tools such as the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index) and Skindex have been established for dermatology.	1.0347178798585863
Further disease-specific questionnaires have been created to mea-sure time related changes in dermatological patients.	0.87038802879782
We surgically treated twenty patients with axillary hyperhidrosis by liposuction using tumescent regional anesthesia.	0.7544096201640415
After a description of the surgical technique results are presented.	1.061138049233955
Except for trivial hematomas, no complications were seen.	0.9550866028593774
Every patient noted a significant reduction of sweat gland activity in the follow up period.	0.9582666845428092
Long-term results remain to be seen.	1.1340449567427853
The value of cytogenetics performed simultaneously with histopathology was evaluated in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).	0.8771710437048089
Clonal karyotype changes of the bone marrow cells supporting the histological diagnosis were found in 38/69 cases (55 %).	1.060133586174088
The chromosome aberrations, especially complex changes, were significantly correlated to distinct histopathological findings such as atypias of the haematopoietic cell lines and myelosclerosis.	1.1101149065116518
Complex karyotype changes were further associated with short survival of the MDS patients.	0.8522479504081409
Our results demonstrate that cytogenetic analyses are helpful in supplementing the histopathological diagnoses.	0.6851876366775608
Recent developments in molecular cytogenetics even allow the detection of chromosomal aberrations in non-dividing cells from cytological preparations or tissue sections which may become available for routine diagnosis.	0.9362047918015249
In the course of 1 year, Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, which may lead to pseudomembranous colitis and therefore may be very harmful in frail elderly people, was diagnosed in six patients of a geriatric clinic.	1.0898827861492058
The disease is associated with antibiotic therapy, due to an overgrowth of the intestinal flora with Clostridium difficile.	1.0070836175064788
Symptoms varied from a state of asymptomatic carriage or benign diarrhea to acute stages of the disease with severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever and acute phase response.	1.0597554906214273
Diagnosis of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea was established when, in addition to typical clinical symptoms, a toxin-positive stool specimen was found.	1.0112149905886236
Oral vancomycin was effective in all cases, leading to a stop in the diarrhea and an amelioration of systemic inflammatory parameters.	0.9306469056528915
According to recent results, in order to prevent the induction of vancomycin-resistance and in view of higher treatment costs, metronidazole is considered as the drug of choice in mildly and moderately ill patients.	1.0719935439654131
This report analyzes 46 cases of personnel-to-patient transmissions of hepatitis B (HB), hepatitis C (HC) and HIV in health care settings.	1.0141087987767794
Similar circumstances were found for transmission of HB (40 cases, 404 infected patients), HC (4 cases, 224 infected patients) and HIV (2 cases, 7 infected patients).	1.3325268752186752
Cases with the highest number of transmissions (one anesthesiologist with 217 HC transmissions, and one EEG technologist with 75 HB transmissions) were attributed to poor infection control practices.	1.1364049228899387
As long as infected health care workers (HCW) adhere to general infection control measures, a risk for transmission to patients exists only from infected surgeons who perform'xposure-prone invasive procedures'.	0.9010398911545904
Whether changes in duties of infected HCW are necessary should be decided on an individual basis.	0.8262488235775022
Often, the infected personnel were assumed to have acquired the disease occupationally.	0.9557983083225134
Medical practices and devices bearing a risk of infection should constantly be reviewed with regard to risk for patients and personnel.	1.1098872876796957
The healthy newborn infant also has the right to optimal monitoring in order to detect any disturbance in postnatal adaptation as early as possible.	0.9222112876317494
The introduction of painless, simple, and yet reliable methods, e.g., pulse oximetry and transcutaneous bilirubin screening, has considerably improved the situation for obstetricians and midwives.	1.0754663998946876
Injuries of the spine in children rarely occur.	1.0376647680685889
They amount to about 0.2 % of all fractures and dislocation and to 1.5 to 3 % of all lesions of the spine.	1.5495733011138948
The younger an injured child is, the more likely it has sustained a lesion of the upper cervical spine.	1.1417411144599205
This spinal segment in comparison to adults is concerned more often and accounts for 50 % of all C-spine injuries.	1.1713032837192026
Important differences between the adult spine and the spine in the child disappear with the age of 10 years.	1.101688220229404
Later diagnostics, classification and treatment correspond widely with the principles valid in adults.	0.8793547725438523
The knowledge of the normal shape and development of the spine are crucial in avoiding misinterpretations of X-ray films.	1.0937792809381344
Typical examples include the confusion of synchondrosis with fractures or of subluxations of the atlas and the C2/C3 segment with "true" instabilities.	0.9108821052301919
Relevant lesions always are accompanied by clear clinical symptoms.	0.6029628977171168
Specific injuries of the growing axial skeleton are lesions of the cartilaginous endplates and "fractures" of the synchondrosis.	1.1583397444376273
Although a variety of histologic entities were described, primary tumors of the trachea are rare findings.	1.1020645032092937
Over a period of 20 years, 30 patients underwent 31 tracheal resections in two hospitals for thoracic surgery.	0.8898480274492085
Among them 4 patients had thyroid carcinoma involving the trachea.	0.7391305642372483
In these patients a strumectomy combined with tracheal resection was performed.	0.863863220476227
One re-operation for erosion bleeding of the innominate artery on the 8th postoperative day was successfully performed.	0.8460980220704108
All patients showed excellent long-term survival.	1.1439289993175268
Principles, methods and results of percutaneous therapy in acute and chronic vascular alterations of the subclavian artery and its branches.	1.015749166089439
Speculations concerning a possible association between temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) and ear symptoms of otalgia and tinnitus have been made in the dental and medical literature for a long time.	1.0060241021546175
Current understanding of this association is reviewed.	0.6211002377173012
An analysis of relevant studies published between 1947 and 1996 shows that a relatively high percentage of TMD patients reported the presence of ear pain and noise.	0.9614273386556731
However, a cause-effect relationship has not been established to date.	1.3304878495791006
Theories that try to explain the concurrence of TMD symptoms and ear symptoms (particularly tinnitus) by a common underlying cause remain speculative.	0.991731940998494
It has to be taken into consideration that due to their high prevalence, TMDs and ear symptoms in a given patient may be present by chance alone.	0.9590983288292391
A methodological weakness of most of the studies available is the fact that control groups were not considered.	1.0036436075666453
Owing to the lack of prospective, controlled, and randomized studies, statements regarding the effectiveness of certain dental measures for the treatment of otalgia and tinnitus in TMD patients are not well supported.	1.0255143477854147
Our report describes a 46-year-old woman with self-inflicted oedema of the left leg and the left arm.	1.1134740298094103
She induced leg oedema by an elastic bandage tourniquet and arm oedema by holding her arm dependent and immobile.	0.7876711112825249
A preexisting disorder of the affected leg (postthrombotic syndrome) and of the affected arm (hypoesthesia subsequent to surgical injury of the plexus brachialis) delayed the diagnostic proceedings.	1.0960437010670883
Our case report shows that: -  Confirmed presence of organic disease does not exclude limb oedema of self-inflicted origin.	1.157994659484144
-  Oedema resulting from a tourniquet and "hysterical oedema" can be developed by one and the same patient.	1.3227947507201068
-  Effective care of such patients is only possible if dermatologist and psychiatrist work together all the time (liaison psychiatry).	1.089529632188994
Purpose: This study was conducted to control improvement in the high preoperative prevalence of TMJ symptoms in patients treated by long-term orthodontic therapy for class II malocclusion.	1.3757450106404867
Patients and methods: A total of 57 patients were examined at least 8 years after surgery, 37 having received orthodontic treatment and orthognathic surgery and 20 surgery but without orthodontic treatment.	1.0440100033195643
Myofunctional, disk and condylar symptoms were recorded according to the Krough-Poulsen scheme.	0.841199604014248
Results: Both groups showed a normal maximal interincisal distance.	1.189678213896068
The deviation during the opening movement was mainly sigmoidal in the group with orthodontic treatment and terminal in the other group.	1.0851406043019505
Muscular pain predominated in the group without orthodontic treatment.	0.8765474256099937
Clicking sounds of the TMJ were registered in 70% of both groups.	1.165624367093752
Occlusal interference and a higher interocclusal distance when speaking were found more often in patients without orthodontic treatment.	1.052913395595369
Preoperatively, clicking and crepitation sounds had been recorded in 60% of both patients groups.	1.1119700790269875
Conclusion: In conclusion, a high postoperative prevalence of TMJ dysfunction symptoms was found in patients with class II malocclusion 8-10 years after orthognathic surgery with or without orthodontic treatment.	1.3203677996684038
Both groups often exhibited TMJ clicking and crepitation sounds, whereas the patients that had not received orthodontic treatment had a higher prevalence of occlusal interference and muscular pain.	1.0414330756113879
The synthesis of pS 2 protein is induced through estrogen-dependent transcription of the pS 2 gene.	0.8307813265909193
The presence of the pS 2 protein in breast cancer is thought to be as valuable as receptor status, or even more so, in predicting the response to hormonal therapy.	1.1635172072353088
Furthermore, pS 2 appears to be a prognostic factor for primary breast cancer.	1.2878587530231218
In 162 cases of primary breast cancer, pS 2 was tested by immunohistochemical procedures on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues.	0.8559517225589006
Staining was evaluated semiquantitatively using an immunoreactive score (IRS).	0.7491599172325342
The concentrations of pS 2 in tumor cytosol were determined using an immunoradiometric assay.	0.8855291009666739
Positive staining for pS 2 (IRS >= 2) was seen in 27 % of the tumors.	1.339245068729441
Comparison of immunohistochemical and biochemical detection (26 % of tumors had pS 2 cytosol concentrations above the cut-off value of 26 ng/mg cell protein) revealed an 81 % concordance rate (r = 0.76; P < 0.0001).	1.0823160455442118
Univariate analysis showed no significant correlation of immunohistochemical pS 2 detection and age or menopausal status of patients, tumor size, tumor grade or nodal status.	1.0994959905582258
However, the immunohistochemical pS 2 status correlated significantly with the immunohistochemical detection of the estrogen (ER; P < 0.001) and progesterone receptor status (PR; P < 0.0001).	0.9794115720176458
pS 2-positive tumors were ER-positive in 66 % of cases and PR-positive in 73 %; 89 % of pS 2-positive tumors were positive for ER and/or PR.	1.2241177610604423
The incidence of immunohistochemical pS 2 detection was 41 % in the group of steroid receptor positive carcinomas (ER- and/or PR-positive) in contrast to 7 % in steroid receptor negative tumors (ER- and PR-negative).	1.2107682054392699
Patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass grafting may develop acute myocardial infarction late after surgery.	1.0794862757945938
It is not exactly known in these patients whether acute infarction is predominantly caused by occlusion of bypass or native vessels.	1.0319811828314556
Also, there is no systematic and prospective data available with respect to an invasive, revascularizing therapeutic approach.	0.9522337466216887
Therefore, acute coronary angiograms were obtained in 21 consecutive patients with acute infarctions and remote bypass grafting to elucidate mechanisms causing myocardial infarction in these patients, and to assess results of catheter-based recanalization.	1.361936083886894
We report the clinical and laboratory results of a family where one boy and one girl presented with a clinical picture resembling the X-linked agammaglobulinemia known as Bruton's disease.	1.279142431166093
Both children showed severe bacterial infections starting at the age of around 6 months, a lack of all immunoglobulin classes and absence of mature B-cells in the peripheral blood.	0.9931031084430754
With respect to reports from the literature these results are yet another indicator for the existence of an autosomal-recessiv disorder with the same clinical make-up as Bruton's disease.	0.9924177556148536
A deletion on chromosome 14 leading to the disorder was identified.	0.8766986393033949
Conservative treatment of genuine stress urinary incontinence in females gained more and more interest.	0.8183344234722871
The use of mini-devices is one of the newly developed therapeutical options however, its clinical relevance and longterm-results are still under debate.	1.232756641803206
This review article gives a critical evaluation of the available urethral plugs and regulators and new developments as well according to the longterm-follow-up studies in the literature and own experience with those devices.	1.2295364658490646
The continence rates that can be obtained with the different plugs or regulators are dependent upon the degree of stress incontinence, ability to insert the plug and compliance of the patient.	0.9816935173190421
Reported longterm results vary between 48 % and 100 %.	1.2365454314213422
The most frequent side effects are urinary infection, haematuria and/or handling problems with the devices.	1.0368024901568156
According to the published material it is impossible to give therapeutical standards for treatment of female stress urinary incontinence with urethral mini-devices.	0.9288479030709051
Although proper Patient selection might give excellent longterm-results in patient continence rates.	0.8161558758580932
Background: In contrast to the correction of simple myopia there is no widely accepted technique for the correction of myopic astigmatism.	1.148529265346031
Currently two techniques are available: the photoastigmatic refractive keratectomy (PARK) and the combination of arcuate keratotomies with standard PRK (PRK-T).	1.1318988295377572
Although there are randomized data for CABG vs. medical therapy and CABG vs. PTCA in primary therapy of CAD, there is few evidence on the appropriate therapy of recurrent angina after prior CABG.	1.0918325055468994
We analyzed data from 1265 consecutive patients (PTS.)	0.9188158023509547
presenting for recurrent angina after previous CABG who required either re-CABG (n=67), PTCA (n=768) or medical therapy alone (medRx) (n=430) at our institution during 1986 through 1996.	1.1621949627352093
Outcome after index therapy is monitored during 45  +/-  34 months.	0.9697078292096448
The 3 therapeutic groups were similar with respect to gender (84 % male), age at therapy (60 years), prevalence of diabetes (22 %), and time to first ischemic event after primary CABG (37 months).	1.2684662393366941
Actuarial survival was significantly higher in the PTCA-group at 1, 5 and 10 years after therapy of recurrent angina, despite the freedom from subsequent re-intervention was significantly lower (1-year-survival 95 % [37 %] vs. 95 % [3] medRx vs. 79 % [4 %] re-CABG, 5-year-survival 87 % [57 %] vs 78 % [17 %] medRx vs. 50 % [4 %] re-CABG and 10-year-survival 72 % [65 %] vs. 63 % [31 %] medRx vs. 50 % [15 %] re-CABG resp., p < 0.0001, [numbers in brackets represent corresponding values for incidence of re-intervention, p < 0.0001]).	1.359428045400521
These findings were similar after adjustment for different baseline characteristics.	0.8958057574516919
Due to advances in surgical methods, such as miniplate and lag screw osteosynthesis, there is current discussion about the adequate therapy of condylar fractures.	1.0060493474399803
Regarding the insufficient outcome of conservative treatment confirmed by refined methods of functional diagnosis, there is a trend towards surgical therapy, at least in cases of condylar displacement out of the fossa.	1.0756345614656282
This trend was also prompted when surgeons learned that the condyle determines local growth but does not serve as a growth center of the mandible.	0.95528479187676
Along with increased interest in temporomandibular function and surgical therapy of internal disorders, surgical therapy of traumatic soft tissue lesions was emphasized.	1.0207025109872672
This consequently led to surgical restoration of intraarticular fractures.	0.7056607516014889
Conservative treatment will nonetheless be sufficient in cases of minor displacement due to a higher ability of remodeling, even more so in children.	1.1347352937863895
A case of a 37-year-old woman with symmetrical bilateral apocrine hidrocystomas at the lateral margins of the eyelids is presented.	1.0926946735167722
The symmetrical, simultaneous and bilateral appearance of the lesions, the lack of association with other abnormalities and the absence of the lesion in the family history make this case remarkable.	1.1675642404809004
The situation of intensive care units (ICU) in Germany was analyzed by a national survey.	1.2507470193943522
Questionnaires consisting of multiple-choice and short-answer questions were sent to ICUs of university hosptitals, hospitals with >1000 beds, 500-1000 beds, and hospitals with <500 beds separately with regard to the different disciplines (anesthesia ICUs, surgical ICUs, cardiac surgical ICUs, neurosurgical ICUs, neurological ICUs, mixed-surgical ICUs, internal ICUs, interdiscipline ICUs).	1.1026936112744434
The personality organisation and the process of therapy of drug-addicted patients are examined by the comparative analysis of 15 single cases.	0.9926813993511927
The antisocial tendency is emphasised as the main clinical feature.	0.8849289116821176
It is related to specific genetic traumata and the externalisation of parts of the superego.	0.7470010287902296
During the therapeutical process, the antisocial tendency destroys the therapeutical relation.	0.9515869148394437
If it is possible to continue therapy beyond this point, the patients can now enter into a process, in which new identifications and the integration of parts of the superego are involved.	1.2232985124675249
Approaching the end of the therapy, patients, again, tend to destroy the results of therapy if one does not consider specific problems of the separation process.	1.1872249938864534
Objective: The Uppsala-definition of leukoplakia has recently redefined oral leukoplakia.	0.8567784468654117
Based on this definition, the aim of our study was to reevaluate the prevalence of oral leukoplakia in patients with histologically proven primary oral cancer.	1.012241139530169
Design: A total of 101 inpatients in four tumor centers in Berlin were interviewed and clinically examined just prior to surgery of an oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).	0.9706080086309068
Results: The prevalence of leukoplakia immediately adjacent to the carcinoma was 15.8%.	1.0139492183243994
Additional leukoplakias without relation to the carcinoma were found in 4% of the patients.	1.0772501368085747
There were no significant differences in age- or sex-distribution, history of tobacco habits or diet  between patients with or without leukoplakia.	1.1079294169982175
T1 carcinomas were found in 62.5% of patients with, and 24.4% of patients without associated leukoplakia, whereas a balanced distribution was found for the pre-operative staging of the tumor.	1.2677016171088986
Conclusions: The prevalence of oral leukoplakia in patients with OSCC was low, compared to retrospective studies.	0.8519598605233792
The presence or absence of leukoplakia indicated no influence on the prognosis of the tumor, except of tumor size.	0.972971031969276
The results emphasize that most OSCC develop from healthy appearing oral mucosa.	0.7117383660394704
Cutaneous angiosarcomas mainly arise on the scalp and face of older patients.	0.8522046937955441
They present with reddish nodules or plaques and tend to bleed and ulcerate.	0.6781987716822707
Angiosarcomas show an aggressive and recurrent course and have a high potential for metastasis.	1.0730500095383357
We report on a 48-year-old patient with unilateral eyelid edema as the first manifestation of an angiosarcoma.	1.1257091529393901
The clinical presentation, the history of contact allergy, the presence of antinuclear antibodies, and abnormal thyroid function tests favoured a non-neoplastic disease.	1.152551724143947
However, multiple biopsies confirmed the diagnosis of a highly differentiated angiosarcoma.	1.5433782877465185
Staging of the patient revealed no metastasis.	1.3259006324003484
After radical surgery including orbital exenteration and postoperative radiation therapy, no recurrence was observed with a follow up of 26 months.	1.0729507467264996
This case underlines the importance of including angiosarcoma in the differential diagnosis of unilateral eyelid edema.	0.6966042479936124
The Marburg Cardiomyopathy Study (MACAS) is a prospective observational study designed to determine the value of the following potential non-invasive arrhythmia risk predictors in more than 200 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) over a 5-year-follow-up period: New York Heart Association functional class, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and ejection fraction, left bundle branch block and atrial fibrillation on ECG, QTc and JTc-dispersion on 12-lead ECG, abnormal time-domain analysis and spectral turbulence analysis of the signal-averaged ECG, ventricular arrhythmias and heart-rate variability on 24-hour Holter ECG, baroreflex sensitivity, and microvolt T wave alternans during exercise.	1.1006458411094615
Abstract   The observation of extremely variable clinical courses for patients with renal cell carcinomas of an identical pathological stage as well as a comparable histological differentiation resp.	1.2265749555892027
growth pattern strongly indicates the existence of tumors harboring different biological aggressiveness.	0.7152832492824892
Currently available histopathological classification systems do not predict the biological behaviour of renal cell cancer as sufficiently as the establishment of a therapeutical strategy adjusted to the individual patient would require.	1.0759890884057797
The need for a more refined characterization of the biological potential of the indidual tumor results from the introduction of modified operative strategies as organ-preserving surgery, for example, as well as from the recently suggested application of an adjuvant systemic therapy adapted to the individual risk for tumor recurrence resp.	1.0838149027680914
the development of progressive disease.	0.7122513197707615
Therefore, the clinically orientated basic scientist and the basic scientifically orientated clinician intensively try to determine prognostically important biological variables which would allow to better predict the biological aggressiveness of a single tumor in addition to "classical" prognostic parameters (T-stage, histological grading, growth patterns).	1.1307003772490025
In this context, several biological parameters including the identification of alterations on the DNA-, RNA- and protein level have been discussed as possible biological prognostic markers for renal cell cancer.	1.1596248468797488
The present review tries to reflect currently available biological characteristics of RCC which might gain clinical importance with regard to an individualized therapy in the near future.	0.915681700517818
Until now reports of factitious disease have not been found in the ENT literature.	1.067100347537964
In contrast, the dermatologic literature estimates an incidence from 0.01 to 0.26%.	1.1803841996451243
In order to achieve effective treatment for these patients, knowledge of the characteristic symptoms is fundamental.	0.9870084694291128
The present paper describes the variety of disease possible, using three cases treated between 1992 and 1994 in the ENT Department of Cologne.	1.0470223029021954
According to the literature, females are involved in a ratio of 9:1, with the majority working in medically related professions.	1.1280236798567487
Depression and anorexia are typical symptoms.	0.5736788620820805
When a factitious disease is suspected, psychiatric consultation is essential.	0.8871658236570552
Confrontation of a suspect patient by the otolaryngologist is not often considered because several reports quote suicidal behavior in up to 25% of self-manipulating patients and tendencies to refuse to follow psychiatric treatment are considerable.	0.9866197568099313
Numerous different diseases lead to scarring alopecia with irreversible follicular destruction as a common ending.	0.871280131386675
Current classifications are based on clinical, histopathological or prognostic parameters, as well as on pathogenetic criteria which allow only a rough assessment because the precise mechanisms leading to scarring alopecia are still unknown.	0.8753330318318089
Inadequacies of the established classifications are obvious when regarding special forms of scarring alopecia like lichen planopilaris or pseudopelade Brocq.	0.8129333377400172
In order to develop more satisfying classifications, recent insights into biology and pathology of the hair follicle and follicular cycling have to be considered.	1.0034508552379142
The most important structures for the survival of the hair follicle are the epithelial stem cells which reside in the follicular bulge and the fibroblasts of the dermal papilla including the molecular communication between these two cell populations.	1.0663454911865422
Research in the field of scarring alopecia should aim at defining the pathological processes on any of the above mentioned levels which will lead to an irreversible damage of the hair follicle thus allowing the development of new therapeutic agents.	1.0932631251847642
Rheumatoid neutrophilic dermatitis is a rare dermatologic disorder seen in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis.	1.0500180499007754
Clinically firm erythematous 3-5 mm papules are found mainly on the arms, the hips and the proximal thighs.	1.1416125753703192
The lesions may be pruritic leading to excoriations and crusts.	0.660597322627077
Histology reveals a dense dermal infiltrate with neutrophilic granulocytes, while leukocytoclasia may be seen, vasculitits is not observed.	0.8994671107279805
This overview of rheumatoid neutrophilic dermatitis may help remind the practioner to include this uncommon disorder in the differential diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis-related dermatoses.	0.9192532175239869
Background: The rehabilitation of low vision patients is of increasing importance since the number of these patients has grown rapidly.	1.1665924597124249
We wanted to evaluate the actual spectrum of patients concerning age and diagnoses and the appropriate low vision aids (LVA) in 1 year.	1.0900895392512688
It is generally accepted that most inguinal hernias should be operated electively.	0.7652485472543724
This study presents a risk calculation challenging this view.	0.7091312539843029
Three strategies are presented: prophylactic indication on principle (A), elective operation in every second case (B), and operation in case of strangulation only (C).	1.058379322159013
On the basis of available epidemiological data it is calculated that, for the male German population aged 65 years and over 69 954 (A), 36 292 (B), and 2630 (C) inguinal hernia repairs would be necessary annually; 167 (A), 145 (B) and 123 (C) perioperative deaths would occur, connected with 1702 (A), 1373 (B) and 1048 (C) years of life lost, respectively.	1.0584339225402393
Thus, operation of every inguinal hernia would result in a (small) reduction of life expectancy.	1.2694069224423377
These data provide evidence that in elderly patients the indication for operative treatment of inguinal hernias should depend upon symptoms and suffering.	0.9804220952404554
There is no reason to operate on asymptomatic patients because of a presumed risk of strangulation.	1.008140373042994
Since first described by Kibler (1955) hyperalgetic areas of the skin in company with arthropathy or diseases of internal organs are known to be a useful sign to define the affected segment.	1.153064279708186
While seldom utilized by physicians, physiotherapists frequently make use of these special findings concerning the skin as a common part of their daily work.	1.0560282119973905
A certain problem exists in ranging correctly the corresponding segment of the spine, this mostly caused by the inaccurate idea of anatomical facts.	0.9450448623022217
The actual as well as the former literature in this field shows very different views and opinions, all of them rather in contrast to the real anatomical findings.	1.3320019293378094
In the following the topographic-anatomic conditions are presented of which exact knowledge is necessary to evaluate the palpation's result "Kibler's plica positive" relative to its diagnostic valence.	1.0455330083390413
Aim of the study and methods: In the present study the correlation between ischemia induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias and a dynamic behavior of ventricular late potentials was investigated.	1.25226669262447
In 16 patients with significant coronary artery disease and survived sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia an electrophysiologic study (EPS) was performed.	0.9823663605767966
Before EPS (t1), at every stimulation interval and after induction of a ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) the lactate concentration was measured in arterial blood and in the coronary sinus for calculation of the myocardial lactate extraction.	1.2608268989823643
Furthermore, before investigation, after induction of a VT/VF and after a 10 minute recovery phase an analysis of the signal averaged ECG was performed.	1.2115613969252776
Nine patients showed a so-called "lactate reversal", i.e., an increase of the lactate concentration in the coronary sinus over the concentration of the arterial blood as an expression of ischemia development, during inducibility of a VT/VF (group A).	1.0955108269929195
The control group consisted of 7 patients without ischemia related VT/VF (group B).	0.8891850192299119
Results: In group A significant changes of the three late potential criteria were found between t1 and t2 (QRS:115.61 +/- 13.86 vs. 126.06 +/- 16.74, p=0.08; RMS: 25.81 +/- 22.26 vs. 13.11 +/- 10.72, p=0.01; LAS: 37.72 +/- 19.26 vs. 50.06 +/- 10.72, p=0.01).	1.0883923372573743
In group B, no significant changes could be measured.	1.101418627949433
Furthermore, the prevalence of late potentials increased in group A from 66% (t1) to 89% (t2), whereas in group B no increase was detectable.	1.3566452618048936
Conclusions: These data suggest a dynamic behavior of ventricular late potentials in correlation with the inducibility of ventricular tycharrhythmias due to ischemic circumstances.	1.1058566680695878
Therefore the dynamic behavior of ventricular late potentials can be an expression of a modification of the arrhythmogenic substrate in arrhythmia endangered patients.	0.8241229249547208
Recent studies and reviews continue to report a high mortality associated with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which involves a severe inflammatory reaction within the whole lung that is frequently associated with multiple-organ failure.	1.0514474668767728
Important factors contributing to the poor results in severe ARDS are the aggressive procedures required to maintain sufficient arterial oxygenation, such as mechanical ventilation with high inspiratory pressures and high inspired oxygen concentrations (FiO2) which themselves contribute to the progression of the disease.	0.9889924544234079
As no specific therapy that reduces or prevents the general inflammatory reaction is known, current therapy is limited to procedures that minimize peak inspiratory pressures and FiO2.	0.988177617608018
Therefore, pressure- and volume-limited ventilation modes with positive end-expiratory pressure, controlled hypercapnia, differential lung ventilation when appropriate, positioning (particularly prone), and aggressive dehydration are used.	1.2339150168902027
Should these procedures fail to improve arterial gas exchange, the patients may be additionally treated by veno-venous extracorporeal gas exchange.	0.9478371597367752
To reduce the risk of severe haemorrhagic complications due to high levels of systemic heparinization, systems internally coated with covalently bound heparin, which allow a lower level of systemic anticoagulation, should be used.	0.9541416275031722
From April 1989 to August 1993, 89 patients were transferred to our intensive care unit for treatment of severe ARDS; 52 were treated by combining the described conventional methods without artificial gas exchange (survival rate 88%) and 37 additionally underwent artificial gas exchange (survival rate 57%).	1.0196278834110817
The overall survival rate was 75%.	0.8144968214385702
On the basis of these experiences, we conclude that this step-by-step approach may improve survival in patients with severe ARDS.	1.1845456380275416
Cutis marmorata teleangiectatica congenita (CMTC) is a rare congenital vascular disorder of the venous system.	1.0758494508937373
