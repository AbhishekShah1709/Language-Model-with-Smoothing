Clinical improvement of the cutaneous manifestations is noted in most cases and usually occurs during the first year of life.	1.150754056978156
We present a patient with CMTC with a band-like pattern following the L3 dermatome.	1.0088277898038616
At the age of 13 years, the skin manifestations worsened, with ulcerations and intermittent claudication.	1.1794049665978257
Angiographic imaging revealed stenosis of the deep femoral artery, and the circumflex femoral artery and the first perforating arteries were not visualized.	1.1361050617063067
To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of CMTC with anomalies of the large arteries.	0.9252929475325862
Introduction: The efficacy of vascular surgery in the treatment of popliteal arterial aneurysms (PAA) and the justification of conservative therapy was investigated in the present study.	1.32975794904479
Materials and methods: From January 1985 to December 1996, 87 patients were operated on for PAA.	1.0220661085090494
The clinical records were reviewed retrospectively and patients were categorized concerning PAA-related symptoms, vascular run-off, and material used for vascular reconstruction.	1.0998364425630085
Patients were examined, and the patency of the vascular reconstruction was checked by palpation and Doppler sonography.	1.1985860992228412
Results: The cumulative survival calculated using the Kaplan-Meier curve was 70% after 10 years.	1.238088391683773
Asymptomatic patients had the best results and patients with acute ischemia, the worst.	1.3629779910373572
The outcome concerning patent vs. occluded run-off and autologous vs. heterologous bypass material was similar.	0.8682410387510959
Conclusion: Asymptomatic and uncomplicated PAA should be treated surgically.	1.0841829135282597
Only PAA with a diameter less than 2 cm, and without thrombus on the vessel walls can be treated conservatively.	1.0811773646254543
Collodion baby is a clinical description for a transient condition of the newborn which is caused by various disorders of cornification.	1.051546232379249
The majority of cases are due to autosomal recessive lamellar ichthyosis.	0.9150223386846329
In up to 10% of cases "self-healing" of the skin occurs.	1.4534522982216695
We report about a mature male baby who at birth was covered entirely with a shining, collodion-like membrane.	0.9010033703716934
There also were marked ectropion of the eyelids and eversion of the lips.	0.8728686095648509
After shedding of the membrane almost complete clearing of the skin occurred until the age of three months.	1.1018561565090932
In the case reported here skin biopsies taken on the 20th day of life showed discrete and non-specific ultrastructural changes, with no features of lamellar ichthyosis or other cornification disorders.	1.1440194099973227
Past research on the phenomenon of enhanced pain sensitivity in fibromyalgia syndome (FS) revealed evidence for both a higher pain magnitude in response to nociceptive stimuli (hyperalgesia) and a general perceptual amplification of sensations (hypervigilance).	1.062786051522062
In order to distinguish between these two aspects of disturbed sensory processing in FS, cerebral evoked potentials after brief painful laser and auditory stimuli were measured in 10 FS patients.	0.9523248131832219
Results were compared with those from age-matched painfree controls.	0.9475901213955947
Amplitudes of middle-latency (N1) and long-latency (P2) laser evoked potentials (LEPs) were significantly higher in FS than in controls.	1.0347461335589714
Furthermore, laser intensity at pain but not at sensation threshold was lower in FS than in controls.	1.042988644026876
However, auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) did not differ between groups.	1.1193204377852588
Enhanced N1 and P2 amplitudes of LEPs suggest stronger sensory and attentional processing of nociceptive information in FS, respectively.	0.7667434853354941
The concept of hypervigilance is challenged by the failure to find differences in auditory perception among FS and control patients.	0.8837070362372428
Yet, the importance of unpleasant intensities of auditory stimulation, not applied in this study, to reveal abnormal non-nociceptive perceptual amplification in FS is discussed.	1.0861737340071072
In a prospective study, 53 fractures of the distal fifth of the tibia were stabilized by unreamed nailing.	1.1331053015906554
Additional involvement of the ankle joint occurred in 18 patients.	0.8631078895859999
50 patients returned for follow-up.	0.6562999089649543
In 30 patients tibia and fibula were fractured at the same (distal) level; in 20 patients the fracture of the fibula was located more proximally.	1.1112466364578761
In 12 patients the fractures extended into the tibial pilon.	0.8969845506622357
Severe soft tissue damage was seen in 24 fractures (18 open, 6 closed).	1.1415890232623374
Ninety percent of all fractures healed uneventfully without further surgical intervention after unreamed nailing.	0.9572834711426796
In two patients the unreamed nail had to be exchanged for a reamed tibial nail.	0.8785034528432222
Bone grafting and secondary dynamization of the nail by removal of a proximal interlocking bolt were performed in one case each.	1.1834242036750706
Thirty-one fractures healed in anatomical position.	0.9092375907978316
Valgus or varus angulation of less than 5  ° occurred in 18 patients.	0.844686294637931
One fracture healed with rotatory angulation of 15  °.	0.7257361374474737
The highest rate of complications (22 %) was seen in patients with distal fractures of the fibula without additional plating (of the fibula).	1.2325063207377869
There was no deep infection.	0.8645762960067617
Tibial fractures close to the ankle joint can be managed by unreamed nailing.	0.9896383949016696
Distal fractures of the fibula should be stabilized by additional plating.	0.9582230214806713
Because of the unreamed technique of implantation this procedure can also be used in grade II or III open fractures.	1.1197646356885638
Complex mechanisms have evolved in mammalian cells for regulating cellular lifespan.	0.7160078172579193
Normal cells demonstrate a strictly limited growth potential and senescence after a defined number of cell divisions.	0.8559186175785563
In contrast, tumor cells often exhibit an apparently unlimited proliferation potential and are termed immortalized.	1.0132378973197642
It has been proposed that the progressive shortening of the tips of the eukaryotic chromosomes - the telomeres - is an important component of senescence and is involved in the control of cell cycle.	1.2718957801711581
The enzyme telomerase adds TTAGGG repeats onto mammalian telomeres, preventing their shortening.	0.8141662395273997
Telomerase is normally inactive in most somatic cells, but detectable in tumor cells.	0.991381911036341
The activation of telomerase in malignant cancers seems to be an important step in tumorigenesis in order to gain the ability of indefinite proliferation and to become immortal.	1.0619500502675612
This review describes the present knowledge of telomeres and telomerase and their role in cellular senescence and human aging.	0.7923743411597011
It summarizes aspects of telomerase in cancer and its function as a diagnostic and prognostic tumor marker.	1.0365224740251828
PCR-based diagnosis of infectious diseases has developed into an important method in surgical pathology.	0.8223050539497218
We summarize our experience in this area based on 3500 analyses performed during the past 5 years.	1.1692971225947248
The peculiarity of material from a pathological laboratory is the risk of DNA fragmentation as a consequence of tissue fixation.	1.0304103752650535
For this reason the assays used must be adapted to this particular situation.	1.0186759950189817
PCR-based diagnosis of infectious diseases, if performed according to appropriate quality standards, is a safe and effective technique with high sensitivity and specificity and results in an etiologically based diagnosis.	1.1033490103384873
The shift of age distribution within the population of industrialized societies has led to an increased need of treating diseases in elderly patients and at the same time in a higher number of patients bearing an increased operative risk.	1.1397374150192872
Today, the development of surgical techniques and intensive care treatment enables us to carry out numerous procedures in geriatric patients.	1.0159828920405176
Innovative surgical techniques like minimal invasive surgery with minor trauma due to the surgical approach changed patient's categories, also.	1.1252991427403314
Taken together with other procedures causing less operative stress indications for patients who were not operable previously have changed.	1.0118531426450175
New developments such as organ transplantation and immunosuppression also generated totally new groups of patients with very distinct conditions for the operative procedure.	0.95292488749302
Vanishing indications or selection of patients as in peptic ulcer disease changed the surgical approach completely: Negative selection has shifted elective operative interventions in ulcer disease to emergency procedures.	1.0109707480865724
Contrasting experiences made in most other countries and especially in the third world, in Germany economic restrictions have not been encountered as of yet.	1.2494390984490062
Economical conditions, an increase in surgical procedures in elderly patients and advances in medical science will continue to change the surgical patient's characteristics profoundly.	1.1323318863296656
From the physicians viewpoint we have to actively participate in this development by personal interaction with the patient, by interdisciplinary cooperation and prompt social and political action.	1.080561238829972
Osteoid osteomas are tumors with intense clinical symptoms and extensive reactive bone changes far exceeding the volume of the lesion itself.	1.034482057304623
Because of their small size they can be approached by minimally invasive surgical procedures.	0.8789283451266597
We treated ten symptomatic patients with osteoid osteomas (n 6 hip point, n 1 iliac bone, n 1 femoral diaphysis, n2 tibial diaphysis) by excision of the nidus with a 3-mm Harlow-Wood needle using a percutaneous CT-guided approach.	1.1428459085348905
Seven patients with residual tumor were treated with either thermocautery (n 2) or sclerosis with 1 ml of 96% ethanol (n 5).	1.4612333258632013
Six patients had instant and constant relief (3 years' observation) of their pain.	1.2618618555575754
In two patients a second transcutaneous intervention was successful.	0.9503128187420117
Only two patients needed open resection.	0.8741649516640347
Compared with the invasive open resection of the tumors, sometimes even putting the stability of the femoral neck at risk, transcutaneous CT-guided enucleation of the nidus of the osteoid osteoma with additional sclerotherapy is a good alternative method, especially in the region of the femoral neck.	1.1236601217865634
We live in an epoch that could be designated as the post-Gutenberg-era.	0.7806129974787767
Writing is no longer the dominant sign system.	0.8860671024455553
It is replaced by electronic signs.	0.5366260083810354
We consider approximately the year 1950 as the turning-point between these two epochs, because by then, in the years after the 2nd World War the American households were saturated with televisions.	1.1615799953935118
Thereby, the new sign system asserted itself.	1.1004329150666645
The topic of this article is the transformation of our sign system and thereby of our worlds of symbols, the leap from the world of written signs into the world of electronic signs, and the possibility born out of it to create electronic objects, which I prefer to call virtual objects.	1.1748485912288866
The manipulation of object-choice and object-relationships accompanying this change and the role assigned to analysts in this new world will be considered as well.	0.8859673316400002
These electronic signs developed quickly a life of their own.	0.842098666042946
A totally new class of objects came into being, the class of virtual objects.	0.9418327981788449
These are electronically transformed, completed or wholly electronically produced objects.	0.7178921936958828
This procedure is accompanied by an industrialization of object-choice and object-relationships.	0.7232718508380492
The manipulated object-choice and object-relationship is born and, moreover, a displacement of natural objects through virtual ones.	1.0680352743524624
A change of the socio-cultural understanding is also a consequence of this process.	1.0697872444971914
New patterns of socio-cultural understanding develop, that could be described as industrial feudalism.	0.9452659023526699
The goal of this article is to describe the transformation of our world of signs and the connected industrialization of object relationships, and to interprete them according to our present possibilities.	1.1331644058046484
In this article 34 randomized controlled trials examining peripherally mediated opioid effects after knee surgery are discussed.	0.9418138471532147
All studies examined small doses of morphine injected intraarticularly at the end of knee surgery, but not all studies did show an analgesic effect of the peripheral opioid.	1.1641208895665385
Because of differing study designs a meta-analysis of the data is not possible.	0.9213598128362196
Dysplastic epithelia represent potentially precancerous conditions in which the risk of progression to cancer is unknown in the individual case.	1.0290610936423488
The positive predictive value of mild and moderate dysplasias of the uterine cervix is only about 13%.	0.8246159107993691
Using DNA image cytometry on restained, conventional Pap-smears the cytometric equivalent of chromosomal aneuploidy can be detected as marker for neoplastic transformation of cells.	0.9082768306145349
The identification of DNA aneuploidy in dysplastic squamous epithelia can increase the predictive value for malignant transformation to over 90%.	0.8960234230672376
DNA aneuploidy qualifies squamous intraepithelial lesions as high grade (H-SIL) which have to be treated whereas lack of DNA aneuploidy characterizes low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (L-SIL) which have only to be controlled.	1.1281009782597904
The methodology is meanwhile internationally standardized concerning performance and diagnostic interpretation.	0.742443162052184
In this brief article I attempt to sketch a few salient insights from my career as a researcher and practitioner of psychotherapy: The key to successful therapy is undoubtedly the therapist's empathic listening, coupled with a series of other positive attributes and finely honed interpersonal skills.	0.9039709057289615
On the debit side, patients' hostility frequently evokes counterhostility from the therapist which not infrequently results in a negative outcome.	0.9678381123912391
Percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy is a procedure for inserting a tracheal cannula without a large incision, without extensive dissection of pretracheal tissue, and without exposure of the trachea.	1.0740972058224465
The early complications of the technique are usually minor and late complications are rare.	1.0611065664976564
Although it is a simple procedure, it is not a minor operation.	1.4712546026589821
Users must be familiar with the technique, the indications and contra-indications for the procedure, as well as the complications.	1.0518839952316574
Proper training of the operation and knowledge of the procedure will avoid unnecessary complications.	1.1722557465377044
Percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy is a relatively new technique for inserting a cannula in the tracheal lumen.	0.9533918806282541
It can be done at the patients bedside with only minimal complications.	0.9364099137890445
A short history, the indications and contraindications, the early and late complications of the technique, and comparisons with other techniques as well as with conventional open tracheotomy are reviewed.	1.1853954865240186
In this study, a histologic and histomorphometric analysis of delayed and immediate-placed implants was performed.	0.9645389365126842
An implantation of 16 self-cutting conical titanium screw implants was carried out in 8 beagle dogs.	0.9527989115104867
Of these implants, 8 were placed immediately after extraction of the second premolar and 8 implants were placed after 6 months of healing after extraction.	1.1142335318619685
For dynamic histomorphometry, fluorochrome bone markers were injected at two different times prior to euthanasia.	0.7894590635237763
The specimens were examined macroscopically and microscopically 8 months after implantation.	0.8710025442218899
A histologic, dynamic, and static histomorphometry was performed with the aid of different computer programs.	1.2363353705311733
A mean surface of osseointegration of 75.7% and a mean soft tissue implant contact surface of 24.2% was seen in immediate-placed implants.	1.1572306840553708
For delayed implantation, an osseointegrated surface of 80.7% and a soft tissue covering of 19.3% was examined.	1.353745015462472
The fibrogenic structures in the cervical implant part were more dense and there were more adhesive epithelial elements (hemidesmosomes) around delayed implants.	0.9739052806057784
The result of the dynamic and static histomorphometry showed no significant differences in the two groups (P < 0.1).	1.0633027274754119
In conclusion, it can be stated that a new steady-state of the soft and hard tissue around dental implants was seen 8 months after implant insertion in both groups.	1.1310839795351406
There was a pseudoankylotic healing in the osseous part.	0.9694764637232787
The lower level of osseointegration in immediate-placed implants was caused by early resorption of bone in the crestal part.	0.8047509454068653
Thus, a larger part of the implant was surrounded by soft tissue and a long epithelial attachment resulted.	1.1669638457495886
Polydactyly may be preaxial or tibial (halluxside), postaxial or ulnar (side of the little toe) and central (middle toes).	1.06553336237298
The duplication may appear at the distal and medial phalanges or at the whole digit.	0.9598798406133842
The metatarsal bone may be partwise or completely duplicated, the accessory toes may share only one metatarsal.	0.8660551753595044
Surgical intervention may be indicated in shoeproblems, for esthetic reasons or, especially in duplication of the metatarsales, because of secondary deviation of the toes and therefore shoeproblems or plantar callosities.	1.1501015749998231
Preoperative analysis including x-ray is of great importance to achieve good functional and cosmetic results.	1.013135343464083
Across centers, transfusion can vary eightfold for the same mediastinal drainage after adult cardiac operations.	0.8276566894652269
Excessive blood drainage resulting in increased transfusions occurs in 29 % of patients.	0.8560376439270699
Various strategies have been proposed to decrease bleeding and allogenic transfusion requirements in the perioperative period of heart surgery.	1.0704334789049788
Blood conservation methods were reviewed critically.	0.6619307518060513
Avoidance of preoperative anemia, tolerance of low hemoglobin concentrations, the use of autologous blood, and adherence to a strict transfusion protocol will reduce the use of allogenic transfusions.	1.051059783584058
Perioperatively, maintenance of normothermia contributes to improved hemostasis.	0.7139452736810962
Injections with botulinum toxin type A (BTX) are considered the first-line treatment for spasmodic torticollis (ST), blepharospasm (BL) and hemifacial spasm (HFS).	1.0884044494611032
Because BTX brings only temporary and partial relief, patients frequently try other additional therapies to minimize their symptoms.	0.9318738799353881
The subjective rating of all therapies ever tried by patients with ST, BL and HFS was evaluated by using a simple questionnaire.	0.8947910562538612
Two hundred questionnaires were considered (112 TS, 54 BL, 34 HFS).	0.986263987593208
BTX was rated subjectively the best therapy in all three diagnostic groups (median: 2=good effect).	1.0428373802596826
Despite Citalopram and physiotherapy (median: 3=average effect), all other therapies were rated with a median of >=4 (=minimal effect).	1.162501688369447
Patients with ST tried 7.7, patients with BL 2.4 and patients with HFS 2.6 different types of therapy.	1.2376175250956218
In conclusion, BTX is the most effective treatment for patients with ST, BL and HFS, as rated subjectively.	1.019677545986328
Further evaluation of therapies additional to BTX injections is recommended.	0.7531553102521248
The perioperative morbidity and mortality is mainly influenced by the type and duration of surgery as well as the patient's preoperative state of health.	1.2767526698686733
Anesthesia per se, however, may also result in severe perioperative (patho)physiological changes, which may be both desired (e.g.	1.077605231281429
analgesia, vasodilation in vascular surgery) or detrimental (e.g.	0.7250041813189292
hypothermia, ventilatory depression) and which may differ depending on the anesthetic technique used (e.g.	0.8836218522388782
general anesthesia vs. regional anesthesia).	0.7889111284163203
Yet, all anesthestic techniques have in common, that their effects are not limited to the duration of the surgical intervention, but may expand far into the postoperative period.	1.3617917417137406
Therefore, many trials have been performed in the past aiming to compare the impact of different anesthetic techniques on the incidence of postoperative techniques, no significant advantage of one or the other technique has been identified up to now with respect to postoperative mortality or severe morbidity.	1.3186546232956617
This finding may be due to at least three factors.	0.7908151270118118
1) Many side-effects related to anesthesia - due to close postoperative monitoring - are detected and treated early in the postoperative phase (e.g.	1.20366644644066
in the recovery room), thereby preventing serious complications.	1.1502521364744966
2) Postoperative mortality related exclusively to anesthesia probably is so low, that huge patient numbers would be required to demonstrate any significant differences between different techniques.	1.1294177970756625
3) Besides the factor 'anesthesia', may other factors contribute to the anesthesia related morbidity and mortality (e.g.	0.9837648172058661
the factor 'anesthetist') which are hardly quantified.	1.1988460732455757
The fact that clear advantages for a single technique have not yet been demonstrated must not, however, result in anesthetic 'nihilism'.	1.0942652749455963
Rather there may be good reasons in the individual patient (e.g.	0.9286805142131783
lack of a recovery room), to prefer a certain anesthetic technique or drug over another, in order to lower the individual risk of anesthesia.	1.1052441404846747
Whether the use of a certain technique - e.g.	0.9222140097028318
spinal or epidural anesthesia - may contribute to a reduction of specific postoperative surgical complications (e.g.	0.913285306382354
rate of reocclusion subsequent to peripheral vascular surgery) is presently under investigation.	0.9225038075819666
This paper first describes how the project study on the regulation and monitoring of medical treatment arose.	0.9664680065780773
We then introduce its objectives, the members of the study group, the composition of the collective and selection of cases, and the methods used for ascertainment and recording of data.	1.186282454933918
Results are then presented with reference to the various hypotheses put forward.	0.9257248182320288
After some introductory remarks about the traumatizing experience many parents have after the birth of a very small preterm baby (<= 1500 g), a developmental risk model is presented.	1.1317881584830027
This is the basis for an early beginning preventive psychotherapeutic intervention.	1.1847173233088082
In the Ulm Study the comprehensive parent-centered intervention program includes insight oriented focal individual psychotherapy, supportive group psychotherapy, a home visit and a video-based sensitivity training.	0.9554233490947973
The intervention aims to improve parental coping, the process of attachment and parent-infant interaction.	0.8739775111519567
The theoretical implications, the design and the methods of this prospective randomized longitudinal study will be discussed.	1.2079002674069477
We report the case of a 55-year-old male patient who underwent transanal endoscopic microsurgery for recurrent benign rectal adenoma.	0.8970608880111496
He developed severe postoperative retroperitoneal phlegmon and sepsis and died 28 days after the operation due to untreatable diffuse intraabdominal bleeding caused by persistent thrombocytopenia.	0.9260244481001579
Rudolf Nissen was born in Neisse, Schlesien, 9 September 1896.	0.8933808466171524
From 1921 to 1933 he was the favorite pupil of Ferdinand Sauerbruch in Munich and Berlin.	0.7750951346705999
1930 he became professor of surgery at the Charité.	0.5586160886063616
The assumption of power by the Nazi-regime forced Nissen to resign his position and end his career in Germany.	0.8476857335909819
He took over the surgical chair in Istanbul, Turkey.	0.7388284868908946
Emigrating in 1939 to the USA, he held surgical positions in hospitals at New York and accepted in 1952 the chair of Surgery at the University of Basel, Switzerland.	0.9888640678900669
Nissen died in Riehen/Basel on 22 January 1981.	0.6752409798447458
Nissen was a critical observant clinician, an efficient and popular physician, a teacher and a speaker.	1.0404088278464914
Of historical significance are pioneering works in thoracic surgery, the first successful pneumectomy in man, the classical works about the treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and hiatus hernia.	1.1223592234952098
The Nissen-Rossetti type of fundoplication has remained the standard procedure in Europe and the USA.	0.9325013304460134
This study describes the approach that is necessary in outpatient surgery in order to carry out the operation safely.	1.0013445858471524
The particular procedure is discussed, and the necessity of strict postoperative management is shown.	1.1479601752448054
Between 1994 and 1997, the author supervised 4588 outpatient operations, of which 3020 were arthroscopic.	1.0193102606309468
The observed complications are listed and evaluated.	0.6921589092280089
Overall, outpatient surgery is well accepted by the patients.	1.1754235943685292
The criteria for denying a patient surgery on an outpatient basis are laid out.	0.9094120099912815
The Schering Atlas is a teaching file in CT and MRI anatomy designed for physicians and students.	0.8403160482653339
It is available on CD-ROM, shows good image quality, and is easy to use in medium-price-range personal computer systems.	1.0510197729627782
Because of the amount and quality of image material, the Schering Atlas's price is appropriate for institutions, but not for private users.	1.166103357511884
M. Linehan developed "dialectical behavioral therapy" specifically to treat chronically suicidal borderline patients.	0.6958459340924692
It rests on a biosocial model that assumes a disorder in the regulation of emotions and in tolerance of stress.	0.8524137213723264
The numerous dysfunctional patterns of behavior such as self-destructive behavior, inability to govern impulses or severe dissociative phenomena are regarded as attempts at problem-solving.	0.7565054361427509
This concept of therapy focuses on the continuing balance between the necessity of accepting maladaptive behavior patterns in both an intrapsychic and an interactional context while still working to change them.	0.8927440709025608
A comprehensive manual outlines the clearly structured therapy and integrates a wide choice of therapeutic strategies.	0.7885674057252295
Parallel to development of the therapy itself, a method also was developed for testing therapist adherence to the manual's guidelines, thus providing a basis for empirical evaluation.	1.171289515361959
An initial controlled, randomized study demonstrated the significant superiority of this method to methods of unspecific psychotherapy at various levels.	1.0636264906571242
In the current endeavor to develop disorder-specific approaches to the treatment of personality disorders, "dialectical behavioral therapy" is a noteworthy model.	1.1611823337965326
Complications associated with the application of a halo device are not infrequent; however, osteomyelitis of the skull with a consecutive subdural abscess is a rare but severe complication.	1.1637426667965796
We present the case of a patient with a subdural abscess as a result of a local pin-track infection of the halo device, in whom pathological behavior was the primary clinical finding.	1.2014396538588383
The possible complications associated with the halo device are discussed with emphasis on associated head injuries and preexisting neurological diseases, as well as indications for the halo, clinical symptoms of pin-track infections, necessary diagnostic measurements and the appropriate treatment.	1.1021337748307316
The attempt was made to explain dysfunctions of the motor system - analogical to electronic data processing systems - as a speciality of the regulation part of the motor system.	1.1760391184360968
Thereby dysfunctions can be seen as misplaced variables in the regulation software with not defined or unknown values of afferences or combination of afferences.	0.9813589686501323
This leads to a failure of the corresponding software modul that results in the loss of function which is regulated through this modul.	1.0394206860113702
Especially with changing of afference through manual treatment or through needling, a replacement of the variables can be reached and this leads to normal function.	1.0512586752588688
With this hypothesis all phenomens of dysfunctions can be explained.	0.7622247351699198
Empirical data on costs of care for chronically mentally ill patients in Germany are rare.	0.833867724105941
There is a lack of cross-sectional studies as well as of any analysis of the long-term course of mental health care costs.	1.0671677789664715
This study combines data from two cost-studies on patients with schizophrenia, conducted in the same catchment area at an interval of 15 years, to draw conclusions about the long-term course of these costs.	1.1155240690449912
The direct costs of comprehensive community based mental health care had increased by 77.0% during 15 years, while the costs of a permanents stay in a long-term ward of a psychiatric hospital had increased by 78.5% in the same period.	1.1297674780172813
This increase was 27 and 28.5 per cent higher than the general rise in cost of living in Germany during the interval between the two studies.	1.129687481376458
This higher-than-average increase in mental health care costs was accompanied by a much higher cost-effectiveness.	0.934115604081644
Thus, this rise of costs must be seen as a consequence of the great deficits and the resulting basic improvement of care for chronically mentally ill patients in Germany, which was demanded by an expert-commission of the government in the mid-seventies.	1.2067632938908266
Background: The usefulness of Holter monitoring to detect rarely occuring symptoms seems to be limited.	0.9431143987986673
In adults the event recorder has already been a precise diagnostic tool in evaluating palpitations and syncopes.	0.9213920409286901
There have been few reports of the implementation of cardiac monitoring with an event recorder in children.	0.9127813993023897
The immunomodulating effect of primary surgical intervention was investigated in 33 patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, pharynx and larynx.	0.9138759871399285
An operation time longer than 7 h was significantly associated with a decrease in lymphocytes, CD4+ T-lymphocytes and CD8+ T-lymphocytes.	0.9661640336886556
The CD4/CD8-ratio as a marker for the down-regulation of the cellular immune response was slightly decreased but was still in the normal range.	0.9629752707019821
CD4-lymphocyte counts increased 7 days after operation while CD8 lymphocytes were found elevated 4 weeks after sugery.	0.9443300096678872
The in vitro stimulation of the lymphocytes was impaired for 1 to 4 weeks.	0.9485802893935988
Interleukins, interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor did not show any changes after surgery.	0.9899276169057418
Decreases of lymphocytes, especially CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, were significantly associated with the time of operation and the volume of blood loss.	1.3349559640363693
Extensive trauma, age, different kinds of anesthesia and intensive care interventions were not associated with specific immunomodulating effects, although these factors might be responsible for suppressing cytokine responses.	1.0248780799736217
Both preclinical and clinical evidence support the usefulness of antidepressants in chronic pain treatment.	0.8575563585432155
Monoamine uptake inhibitors influence the neurotransmissions of noradrenaline (NA) and/or serotonin (5-HT); their effect on nociception is thought to take place predominantly within the spinal cord.	1.1028590456127945
Antidepressant drugs seem to differ in their properties as analgesics and as thymoleptics.	0.8482732848136271
The present work is aimed at correlating the special mechanism of action of antidepressants in diminishing nocicepetion with the pharmacological profile of these drugs in clinical pain treatment.	0.945555201886413
From a preclinical, experimental point of view, it can be expected, that mixed type uptake blockers should be superior to selective NA or 5-HT uptake inhibitors.	1.0716602254098104
The analgesic profile of antidepressants was established by a metaanalysis of clinical trials on the effect of these drugs, given alone or in combination with other analgetics, in chronic pain syndromes.	1.1772742540240824
57 Clinical trials were separated into 5 groups according to their scientific quality: [1] placebo-controlled double-blind studies with high power; [2] placebo-controlled double-blind studies with low power; [3-4] open controlled studies or studies with historical controls; [5] case reports.	1.1569490245298992
A study was positive if the tested antidepressant was more effective than placebo or the compared drug or seemed beneficial with respect to the interval of its previous absence.	1.0718546091069443
The most effective antidepressants in chronic pain treatment only included unselective monoamine reuptake inhibitors in the following rank order: amitriptyline > clomipramine >= desipramine >= imipramine >= doxepin.	1.1291575948091819
A statement about the appropriate dosage of these drugs in chronic pain treatment, however, must wait for properly conducted dose finding studies which include the measurement of plasma concentrations.	1.1518499776703284
Intensive care medicine for both surgical and medical patients has a common scientific and clinical basis.	1.1283277070613793
In critically ill patients the medical conditions are complex and can be managed only by specialists thoroughly trained in intensive care medicine.	0.9233785156248928
Therefore, surgeons as well as anesthesiologists must have a detailed theoretical and clinical knowledge of intensive care medicine.	1.1212895839363453
Surgical training places the emphasis on operative skills, while intraoperative management of the patient by the anesthesiologist calls for skills involved in intensive care medicine.	1.040226448494376
Interdisciplinary cooperation between specialists is essential to improve the quality of intensive care medicine further.	1.0105300579214331
The cooperation that already exists between surgeons and anesthesiologists makes closer collaboration in the future a logical step.	0.9251202162614394
In this review article data of retrospective studies on the therapeutic effects of oxygen are summarized and possible indications for this therapy suggested.	1.2255163055806493
Studies in infants with chronic lung disease (CLD) showed that (i) if SaO2 was kept >= 93 % via generous prescription of home oxygen, rates of sudden death were much lower than in studies where this was less generously prescribed, (ii) weight gain was significantly better with O2 therapy than without it, (iii) increasing SaO2 from 82 to 93 % by providing low-flow oxygen resulted in a 50 % reduction of pulmonary artery pressure, (iv) hypoxia could cause a significant increase in airway resistance, and (v) low-flow oxygen reduced the frequency of intermittent falls in SaO2 to < 85 % even in infants who had values of >= 90 % at rest.	1.2813925926279417
These data suggest that oxygen therapy should be considered in CLD infants if baseline SaO2 is < 93 %.	0.9972211961674203
For older infants, particularly with CF, only few data are available.	1.1100614862036546
In these patients oxygen may only be given if SaO2 is < 90 % unless there are clinical symptoms related to hypoxaemia, e. g. pulmonary hypertension.	1.099828123099371
Regarding the practical aspects of home oxygen therapy, provision of liquid oxygen via nasal cannulae appears to be the method of choice.	0.9201456804474071
Side effects include the risk of CO2 retention, which occurs occasionally in children with CF or sleep-related upper airway obstruction, but has not been reported for infants with CLD.	1.1392484836882375
To identify this potential side effect and to determine the exact amount of oxygen required, performance of a sleep recording of SaO2 and CO2 with and without oxygen is suggested.	0.9573764149090364
In infants with CLD, home monitoring of oxygenation should also be considered.	0.9662658358679688
Fractures of the distal radius represent one of the most common fractures and do have high social-economic relevance.	1.1428840401293787
For treatement they need practicable classification and therapeutic standards.	0.727887946382408
The demand for stable osteosynthesis of A3-, B2-B3 and C1-C2-fractures is connected to dorsal or volar internal fixation with plate and practical autogenous cancellous bone grafting, even for the elder patient.	1.0562351390640339
The isolated external fixation with K-wires represent special situation.	0.7943210987243156
Supply of implants and biodegradable materials will support this development.	0.6611837060708438
Introduction: Pheochromocytoma during pregnancy is rare and represents a high risk for mother and fetus.	1.1885614781656955
Due to the variable clinical presentation it may be mistaken for preeclampsia.	0.914812241685679
Case: A 34-year-old primiapara with hypertension up to 240/120 mmHg.	1.0139615648336888
After diagnosis of a pheochromocytoma its resection together with lymph node metastasis in the 17th week of gestation was performed.	1.0014974159852255
Conclusion: The definitive diagnosis is confirmed by elevation of serum catecholamines and their metabolites in a 24-h urine collection.	1.1490151158336837
Localization during pregnancy can be made by ultrasound and MRI.	1.0720280529378534
The definitive treatment is surgical removal after administration of adrenergic blockers.	0.7374548598219817
If discovered later in pregnancy, delivery by elective caesarean section followed by tumor resection is recommended.	0.7453643847988229
Since about 10 % of pheochromocytomas are malignant, postpartum screening is required to detect and treat extraadrenal or metastatic tumors by MIBG scintigraphy, chemotherapy or surgical procedures.	1.06575652161219
Ionizing radiation from natural or man-made sources may affect human health.	0.74607852866111
The main consequence of low and moderate radiation doses is the induction of cancer.	0.8687221017774259
To quantify these effects both epidemiological studies and experimental radiobiological research are needed.	0.7900652818180788
The ensuing results of the studies are used to establish radiation protection principles and dose limits to protect the public from the effects of ionizing radiation.	1.027128513075053
Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is associated with premature atherosclerosis and early cardiovascular death if untreated.	0.8042961225347843
In an asymptomatic 13-year-old girl we discovered an extensive hypoplasia of the abdominal aorta and the Aa.	1.1342542093563799
iliacae, a combination which so far has not been described, that has not been reported before.	1.2902426739009376
The vascular hypoplasia was asymptomatic.	0.5219137242324586
Angiography additionally showed severe atherosclerosis of the Aa.	0.7065936065367322
After 13 months of low-density-lipoprotein(LDL)-apheresis angiographically there was no pregression, but even slight improvement of vascular the disease.	1.2321747531654206
Discussion: Since severe atheromatous changes of systemic arteries may be missed by clinical examination, we strongly recommend complete imaging of all major systemic arteries in children with homozygous familial hypercholesterinemia.	1.10183983438677
LDL-apheresis is the treatment of choice in these patients.	0.9585011817999445
Since 1993 almost 400 patients with port wine stains have been treated with the flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser.	0.7962311083558671
The therapeutic effect on 61 adult patients was evaluated.	0.9009793092249092
After a mean of 2.16 treatments the colour lightened by between 33% and 100% in 70% of these patients.	1.3559660625925052
The best results were obtained in patients with plain pink port wine stains.	0.8797441020893947
In this kind of port wine stains the argon laser has proved to be far less successful.	0.6769994502820013
The rate of adverse effects amounted to only 5%.	0.8726207806140364
The results are expected to be improved by further laser sessions.	1.1738646027703161
The flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser is an important advance in the treatment of port wine stains.	0.8400378754513714
Most craniofacial malformations result from a premature fusion of skull sutures.	0.8435469223618077
Depending on the scope of the sutures affected, the results are more or less distinct deformations of the facial and cranial skull with substantial negative effects on functional as well as esthetic aspects.	1.168835613063139
The etiopathology is still unclear.	0.43426578858327675
Various therapies have been developed over the past 100 years.	0.963295818281204
However, Tessier's technique of fronto-orbital advancement has been an important milestone in the treatment of these malformations.	1.2925691635158125
Numerous adjustments have since perfected this operational technique.	0.5776559299286277
It is now possible to treat practically all skull malformations with the surgical techniques available today.	1.0101452078140927
At the same time, these techniques have also aided the advancements in tumor surgery and traumatology.	0.9780060019169446
Injuries of the flexor tendon are usually open injuries.	0.8222791539669154
In most cases primary treatment is therefore seldom performed by orthopaedic surgeons.	0.9110114622876673
This is different for injuries of the extensor tendon.	0.6822275277959451
Three quarters of injuries of the extensor tendon are closed injuries.	0.8683642558279479
Therefore we do go into primary and secondary reconstruction of the flexor tendon, but focus on primary and secondary reconstruction of the extensor tendon in the most common zones (1, Th I, 3, Th III).	1.1589574245643293
The Shouldice operation has evolved to become the classic procedure for open pure tissue repair for inguinal hernias.	0.885320308358085
The operation is an important part of a surgeon's repertoire as he may need to perform the procedure at some critical time, especially when faced with strangulation, when tension-free prosthetic repairs and laparoscopic approaches fail.	1.1307515423897156
When properly done, the Shouldice repair yields results that have set standards for all other techniques to emulate.	0.9808490514820786
Other particular advantages of the technique are: safety, the use of local anaesthesia, benign postoperative complications and the cost, which is the most reasonable of all surgical techniques.	1.2580742206278623
Acute occlusive mesenteric ischemia is caused by a local impairment of splanchnic blood flow and poses a particular surgical challenge.	0.8989256197127595
Acute superior mesenteric occlusion is a medical/surgical emergency mandating prompt diagnosis (clinical awareness, angiography) and therapy (exploratory laparotomy with possible arterial reconstruction; embolectomy, thrombectomy; and/or bowel resection).	0.9710608224564276
The difficulty of early diagnosis is probably the most important cause of the high mortality which varies from 70 % to 90 % in arterial and functional mesenteric ischemia and from 20 % to 70 % in an acute thrombosis of the mesenteric veins.	1.516959946894583
Improved survival from nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia is dependent upon the identification of high-risk groups and on aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic measures (intra-arterial infusion of papaverine through the angiographic catheter with or without bowel resection).	0.9603460007548534
For assessment of bowel viability, the clinical judgement during first- or second-look exploration is still the most reliable parameter.	1.2556569259878478
The surgical management of chronic mesenteric ischemia includes aortomesenteric grafting and transaortic endarterectomy in the majority of patients with comorbidity of cardiovascular arteriosclerotic diseases and results in a high rate of symptom-free patients.	1.010462004055358
Prophylactic reconstruction of visceral arteries is indicated only in certain limited circumstances.	0.8817994238681569
Thirty-nine of 63 patients undergoing deep anterior rectal resection received a straight coloanal anastomosis (CAA); the remaining 24 patients additionally had a colon-j-pouch (CPA) constructed.	0.9304043877964199
After pouch-anal anastomosis, local septic complications occurred in 12.5 % of patients compared to 20.5 % after coloanal anastomosis.	1.2109970266490515
Stool frequency after pouch-anal anastomosis was 3.3 per 24 h compared to 5.2 per 24 h after straight anastomosis within the first year after ileostomy closure (P = 0.053).	1.1407773257341
Continence was slightly better in the pouch group (n. s.), and anal manometry showed a significant postoperative decrease only in resting pressure after straight coloanal anastomosis (P < 0.001).	0.9641988196851728
This study supports the construction of a colon-j-pouch after deep rectal resection, as the pouch-anal anastomosis has fewer local septic complications and seems to improve functional outcome.	1.0256425476016922
The introduction of flow-directed pulmonary artery (PA) catheters has helped to improve our knowledge of cardiovascular physiology.	0.8996346215349078
There have been several developments of this equipment in recent years, including continuous monitoring of mixed-venous O2 saturation (Sv\=O2) and cardiac output (CO).	1.0383302146694593
The high purchase price, however, is an obstacle to its use in the critically ill.	1.1874292467716638
The aim of the present study was to analyse the actual costs of these devices in comparison to standardly used intermittent monitoring of Sv\=O2 and CO.	0.942067752572366
Purpose: Persistent hypotony with maculo-pathy is a severe complication of mitomycin C when used during filtration surgery.	1.036667446359847
We wanted to know whether this complication can be controlled by a surgical reintervention yielding tight closure of the initial sclerostomy.	1.052559893073565
The detection of cytokines may elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms that produce early systemic complications in acute interstitial (i) or necrotizing (n) pancreatitis (AP).	1.0030290771683406
The increase in the level of cytokines in the blood of patients with AP may correlate with the severity of the disease.	1.1478297619822388
In a prospective clinical trial from October 1992 to August 1993, 23 patients with AP were recruited and blood samples taken for cytokine detection by commercially available Elisa kits and C-reactive protein (CRP) by laser nephelometry.	0.9868755609097075
Six of 11 patients with nAP died either early (n = 1) or of late septic complications.	1.0443789421768008
The peak of cytokine and CRP level in the first 3 days of hospitalization was used for calculation.	1.2221406089415652
The IL-6 concentration in the blood reached up to 2600 pg/ml in the 1st few days, depending on the severity of AP, and dropped to almost zero in the next days, independently of the clinical course.	1.0056287016530878
The differentiation of i- versus nAP, using a cutoff line of 600 pg/ml, was correct in 20 patients [87 %, sensitivity (SE): 82 %, specificity (SP): 91 %, P < 0.001].	1.2768402056882615
The blood levels of IL-8 reached a maximum of 1381 pg/ml in the 1st few days, depending on the severity of AP, and showed a correlation with the clinical course in the following days.	0.9999895678940425
The peak of IL-8 blood levels indicated correctly the severity of AP in 18 out of 23 patients using a cutoff level of 200 pg/ml (accuracy: 78 %, SE: 82 %, SP: 75 %, P < 0.01).	1.1299571498474013
The CRP levels increased up to a maximum of 535 mg/l and indicated the course of AP correctly in 18 out of 22 patients (SE and SP 82 %, P < 0.01).	0.9799675053678795
There was no correlation between cytokine blood levels and mortality.	0.8940286767501582
In the blood samples of five patients with i- or nAP, no TNF- was detectable.	1.3046878644529794
The blood levels of IL-6, and to a lesser extent of IL-8 and CRP, can predict the severity and early systemic complications of AP.	1.2238977544279406
The excessive rise in cytokines can be explained by the stimulation of immunological cells (macrophages, lymphocytes and endothelial cells) in the course of AP, inducing early systemic complications.	0.9990066262482116
The surface area and the microporosity of bone regeneration materials influence their chemical and biological properties.	0.7947924661177909
Therefore, the size of the specific surface area and the distribution of the pore diameters (pores < 1 µm) of bone regeneration materials were analyzed within this study.	1.1035348350684635
The analyzed hydroxyapatites were of synthetic, bovine, and phytotroph origin.	0.9841177037781679
The tricalcium phosphates and the bioglasses included only synthetic materials.	0.6513238440115616
The gas adsorption of each specimen was analyzed using a volumetric N2/Kr system (ASAP 2010, Micromeritics).	0.7954164025779932
Additionally, for materials with a specific surface area (> 2 m2/g) the pore size distribution was evaluated by the BJH-method.	1.2650222855968198
Two of the materials evaluated astonishingly large dimensions of the specific surface area (BioOss 79.7 m2/g, Algipore new 14.6 m2/g).	0.7585612286591594
A medium surface area was found for Algipore old (4.9 m2/g) and Interpore200 (2.64 m2/g).	1.2617190800949953
All other included materials showed only small sizes of the specific surface area (Ceros80 1.8 m2/g, Ceros82 1.31 m2/g, Cerasorb 1.2 m2/g, Biobase 0.7 m2/g, Endobone 0.7 m2/g, Perioglas 0.6 m2/g, Allotropat50 0.23 m2/g, Biogran 0.2 m2/g).	0.9253088667813583
The materials with large and medium sizes of the specific surface area evaluated the following pore diameters: BioOss 2-50 nm, Algipore new 2-100 nm, Algipore old 5-50 nm, Interpore200 2-100 nm.	0.9230765818383883
Pore sizes less than 2 nm were not found in relevant numbers.	0.9119708063880443
The materials BioOss, old and new Algipore, and Interpore200 contain a large interconnecting mesopore system (diameter < 1 µm).	1.0547552890785177
For the materials Biobase, Endobone, Perioglas, Allotropat 50, and Biogran this cannot be assumed.	0.9392777033701826
The materials Ceros80, Ceros82, and Cerasorb evaluated a specific surface area between those and might include only a small part of these interconnecting pores.	1.0558500798590438
An influence of the interconnecting porosity and the different sizes of the specific surface areas on the biological behavior of the bone regeneration materials can be suggested.	1.0944029332253924
The literature on the psychosocial aspects of head and neck cancer surgery from 1950 to 1995 was reviewed in four parts.	0.4997128130755671
In the present Part 4 ten possibly useful targets for future research are formulated:...	0.9950412094346848
Radiotherapy unequivocally has to be regarded as standard therapy in stage I and IIA/B testicular seminoma.	0.9171916331601399
Using low dose abdominal irradiation tumour control rates of 95-98 % in stage I disease and 80-95 % in stage IIA/B can be achieved.	1.2699085022648873
Disease specific survival reaches 100 %.	0.6699854501248564
Likewise, radiotherapy is treatment of first choice in case of testicular intraepithelial neoplasia (TIN) in a solitary testis or in case of a double-sided TIN yielding safe eradication of the in-situ carcinoma of the testis.	1.2316960882619064
Objectives of further clinical research in radiotherapy of testicular malignancies aim at reduction of treatment intensity in order to minimize acute and late side effects of irradiation without compromising tumour control rates.	1.0217304495206498
A forty year old healthy adult man was admitted to our out-patient department because of a highly elevanted rheumatoid factor.	0.9998003824273908
Since the person was planning an extended stay in Africa, we performed an extensive history, clinical and laboratory examination to rule out oligosymptomatic inflammatory diseases.	1.1646523059731766
We further analyzed if the person presented genetic risk factors to develop rheumatic diseases in the future or if the presence of the rheumatoid factor could be a reaction to multiple immunizations.	1.114554392960838
Possible explanations for an elevated rheumatoid factor including the genetic risk factors are discussed.	0.9283604147140102
A multifactorial etiology underlies the  majority of cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD).	0.8109171953919175
Both ill-defined environmental and genetic factors contribute to the development of the disease.	0.8086229900617492
Allele 4 of ApoE is a genetic risk factor.	0.8033046883799813
Its presence increases the risk of developing AD.	0.8856547777661233
However, presence of e4 is neither necessary nor sufficient for the disease to arise.	1.2368674073032346
Apart from the common multifactorial forms of the disease, there are rare variants which are inherited as Mendelian traits.	1.094142625907111
To date three genes are known that can be  mutated in these rare forms of AD.	0.8498465086293959
Of these, mutations in the gene presenilin 1 on chromosome 14 are most frequent.	0.855800457466354
In addition, mutations in the gene presenilin 2 on chromosome 1 and in the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP on chromosome 21) occur in autosomal dominant AD.	1.0097051253960183
This article reviews our present knowledge of the genetics of AD and discusses its relevance for patients with AD and their relatives.	1.0936685879742907
In recent years female psychoanalysts provided fertile approaches to an understanding of the mother-daughter-relationship with the conceptions of the 'lesbian complex' (Poluda-Korte), the 'symbiotic illusion' (Halberstadt-Freud), the 'higher permeability of the ego-boundaries' (Rohde-Dachser), and the 'conflict of separation-individuation which has to be resolved again and again throughout life' (Berger).	1.0159571688768907
In the light of these conceptions it is hypothesized that in analyses with both participants being of equal gender (female-female psychoanalyses) a specific intensity and quality of female aggression may manifest itself when certain threshold situations of the pre-oedipal mother-daughter-relationship are revided.	0.944839290450169
Case vignettes and a literary example illustrate the risks as well as possible resolutions engendered by these early relationship dynamics, as these are reactivated in the here and now of the analyst's relationship towards her patient.	1.0569800135757927
There has been a marked increase in the incidence of pelvic fractures over the last few years.	0.9798217367146691
Associated injuries to the urogenital and vascular system as well as nerve injuries worsen the prognosis.	0.8528244507698348
Over a five year period 126 patients with severe pelvic trauma were treated.	0.972646778905734
Out of these 39 (30.9%) sustained additional peripelvic injuries and represent the study sample.	1.1619462628523909
Type B injuries according to the AO classification occurred in 16 (41%) patients, type C fractures in 23 (59%) patients.	1.2321243876340982
The spleen, liver and kidney were the most frequently injured organs (58.9%), followed by urogenital lesions (46.6%), nerve injuries (25.6%) and vascular lesions (15.3%).	1.1561987321423728
The most common extrapelvic lesions were thoracic injuries in 56.4% and severe head injuries (GCS<8) in 33.3%.	1.2278092712210662
The mean Hannover Polytraumascore was 35.6 points, the mean Injury Severity Score 27.6 points.	1.19825807115685
Osteosnthesis was performed in 21 pelvic ring fractures (53%), eight procedures (50%) in type B fractures and 13 (56%) in type C fractures.	1.309065766158859
In type B injuries the anterior pelvic ring was stabilized with a tension band wiring in four cases, in two patients with an external fixator and with plate osteosynthesis in one case.	1.2510612725391304
In type C injuries the external fixator was applied as the only stabilizing procedure in six patients.	1.0709919121798896
In four cases the anterior ring was fixed with tension band wiring or plates and the dorsal aspect of the pelvic ring with sacral bars.	1.0355367715916117
Three patients had their additional acetabular fracture plated through a anterior approach.	0.8554232316044477
All surviving 28 patients were followed up for an average of 18 months (range 7--59 months) after the trauma.	1.2831071639079732
The patients were classified using the pelvic outcome score proposed by the German Society of Trauma Surgery.	1.0560736952697931
53.4% of the type B fractures showed a good clinical outcome, 47.6% a poor outcome.	1.2589397426380413
15.4% with type C fractures presented with a good outcome, 84.6% with a poor outcome.	1.2726672224818723
80% of the type B and 23% of the type C fractures had a good radiological outcome.	1.3660571440961935
20% of type B and 77% of type C injuries had a poor radiological outcome.	1.4045130216648898
Five patients (12.8%) sustained persistent urological symptoms.	1.1405445002966008
Three of these had urinary dysfunction, two used permanent cystotomies due to their severe neurolgical deficit after a head injury.	0.943629501332923
Ten patients with nerve injuries at the time of trauma suffered long term neurological dysfunction of the lumbosacral plexus.	1.0066045153649879
The mortality rate was 28%.	0.9962764292684259
Seven patients died in the emergency room due to uncontrollable bleeding, four in the intensive care unit from multi-organ failure.	0.9300649116842896
The management of complex pelvic trauma consists of fracture treatment and interdisciplinary treatment of the associated injury.	1.0760698752126994
Lesions of the abdominal organs or of major vessels must be addressed first if hemodynamic instability is present.	0.974108453047837
Injuries to smaller vessels can be embolized percutaneously.	0.6038839004185547
Urinary bladder ruptures are treated as an emergency, urethral lesions electively after four to six weeks .We recommend external fixation of the pelvis in the acute phase for control of both the osseous instability and control of haemorrhage through external compression.	1.1487353994738267
The treatment of choice for the anterior pelvic ring is tension band wiring or plating.	1.0480377133254184
If this is contraindicated due to an open fracture external fixation is the treatment of choice.	1.097679931585925
Type C fractures require posterior ring stabilization which should be postponed until four days post admission.	0.7766708225220222
Dysfunction of serotonergic neurotransmission has been associated with two different psychopathological syndromes - impulsive aggressivity resulting form a lack of stimulation of the "behavior inhibition system" on the one hand and the manifestation of clinical depression and compulsive syndromes on the other.	1.003028213448404
The examination of primate behavior provides a model which may reconciliate these seemingly contradictory hypotheses.	0.8006519458328403
According to primate experiments, monoaminergic depletion results in anxious and desperate behavior only if the individual has previously been exposed to social isolation stress, which in turn induces a decrease in the central serotonin turnover rate.	0.9989150107924497
Young non-human primates who experience early social separation stress are anxious and fearful, while as adults they tend to be aggressive, consume excessive amounts of alcohol and are less intoxicated by alcohol intake.	0.9175876522605098
These observation indicate the importance of social separation stress in the pathogenesis of alcoholism and antisocial behavior and may point to prophylactic and pharmacological treatment strategies.	0.926227155824933
The implantation of transsclerally sutured posterior chamber lenses (PCL) leads to greater trauma to the eye than endocapsular PCL implantation.	0.7144067718223549
Persistent breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier might impair the postoperative long-term prognosis.	0.9904846412489213
Using laser-tyndallometry, we quantified the disorder of the barrier function during the early postoperative phase and in the long-term postoperative course for both surgical procedures.	1.2194786483718163
During the first 3 postoperative days, flare values were three times higher in the group with transsclerally sutured PCL than in the conventional PCL group.	1.1984797301373826
Cell counts after transscleral suture fixation (27.7 +/- 18.3/0.075 mm3) decreased slightly during the first 5 postoperative days.	1.0398940409520863
In contrast, the conventional PCL group regained the preoperative level (2.5 +/- 5.1) after 3 days.	1.2325456767654654
After 3 months, no significant differences in flare values and cell counts were seen between the two groups.	0.9427781212265336
After implantation of transsclerally sutured posterior chamber lenses, breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier was initially more pronounced than in conventional PCL implantation.	0.890697493572983
However, the barrier function was re-established equally in both groups in the long term.	1.0907617156196994
No signs of a persistent disorder of the barrier were found.	0.9201681210885289
There is clear evidence for obstructive sleep apnea as an independent cause of arterial hypertension.	0.9394716147936322
We report a case of intracranial hemorrhage with systemic hypertension resistant to antihypertensive medication, which could only be adjusted after effective treatment of coexisting sleep-disordered breathing.	1.0169324313680563
The 36 year old male (body mass index 31 kg/m2) was admitted to hospital three weeks before for intracranial bleeding at the left external capsule.	1.0716437475909275
Diagnosis of primary hypertension was made after extensive work-up in the acute hospital.	1.2797046258476024
Blood pressure was adjusted with five-fold antihypertensive medication at the time of admission to neurological rehabilitation, but was still elevated with "non-dipping" as determined by long-term measurement despite medications above the recommended dosages.	1.1194367577179067
Polysomnography confirmed the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea.	0.7718785554655617
10 days after initiation of treatment with nasal CPAP blood pressure control was easier with normal dipping at night.	0.953525583122574
Medication could be reduced during rehabilitation with further reduction after discharge.	0.9122714687521284
Moderate obstructive sleep apnea appears to be the cause of severe hypertension resistant to pharmacological therapy in this patient.	0.9769351894548179
The case underlines the impact of diagnosis and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing for the secondary prevention of stroke.	0.979337100510452
The possibility of a specific origin of joint infection should be considered in finding the diagnosis.	1.1040336152403127
This is demonstrated in a case of tuberculosis of the hip treated in the Dept.	1.2633283103229636
of Trauma Surgery in collaboration with the Medical Dept.	1.0240002499718943
Microbiological and imaging examinations are essential to plan and perform a combined therapy of hip arthroplasty and concomittant medical antituberculous therapy.	0.9531814830655897
In accordance to a literature review, this procedure proved successful for both eliminating the local infection and the functional outcome of the operation.	1.2708498836981563
The purpose of our studies was to investigate experimentally the dose-dependent effects of extracorporeal shock waves on tendon and bone and to unveil therapeutic possibilities in tendopathies and pseudarthroses.	1.2201517878158523
From January 1994 to January 1996, 18 patients underwent vitrectomy as a result of endophthalmitis.	1.0753343228074608
All patients received intraocular and systemic antibiotics in accordance with the first group of patients in the Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study.	1.2027494026091023
The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze the visual outcome of surgical treatment.	1.169065728318574
Tracheostomy is considered the airway management of choice in long-term ventilated ICU patients.	1.175343797731551
In the last few years, percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) has been established as an attractive and safe alternative to conventional open tracheostomy.	1.131236410128847
Recently, there is another percutaneous technique according to Fantoni with translaryngeal airway access (TLT) available.	1.0754982754314595
Our study seeks to evaluate TLT in terms of complications and practicability.	0.7851151123761079
In 47 patients of our surgical ICU, elective TLT was performed.	0.8869954367458467
Mean operative time was 9.8 +/- 10.9 (range 6-27) minutes.	1.114309329329789
Severe complications, such as bleeding, aspiration or infection of the tracheostoma have never been noted.	0.8789757731499337
A slight detoriation of arterial oxygen tension occured in 25 patients intraoperatively, demanding to rise the concentration of inspired oxygen temporarily.	0.9112498534091644
However, no patient became hypoxic during the procedure.Since during the procedure gas exchange may worsen, TLT should not be employed in patients whose inspired oxygen concentration exceeds 80%.	1.1568954189777934
Despite the fact that severe complications associated with TLT have recently not yet been reported, physicians who perform TLT should be well-trained in the technique of conventional open tracheostomy, too.	1.0248086151123896
According to our present data, TLT seems to be an attractive and safe alternative to PDT.	1.0357877725843556
Nevertheless, for a definiteve evaluation of TLT, further investigations in larger groups of patients and in the long term seem to be necessary.	1.4792292012429473
There are no direct associations between testosterone levels and sexual function in the aging male.	0.9753635378312546
A study of 169 patients focusing on the relations of hormone levels and sexual dysfunction did not reveal associations between testosterone levels and the risk of altered sexual functions.	0.9581183085247859
In volunteers, in whom a hypogonadism was generated by the application of GnRH, no alteration in sexual reactions occurred.	1.0841487917626818
It is possible that other testosterone fractions are more meaningful than the total testosterone.	0.9896909730300141
However, all the known fractions correlate closely.	1.4033694680523656
The significance of a normal testosterone level for a normal erection has been rarely considered up to now.	1.1042299539071474
In an animal experiment, the intracavernous pressure, the density of -receptors, and the PDES activity depended on normal testosterone levels.	1.2884734766921864
It is not known whether different testosterone levels influence the effectiveness of treatment procedures for erectile dysfunction in humans.	1.0400512298765459
In a 65 years old male patient 38 cc of a 7.45% potassium chloride-solution was inadvertently infused within 3 hours into an epidural catheter on the first postoperative day.	1.0996837382799691
The epidural potassium chloride administration resulted in a paresis and painful paraesthesia of the patient's legs and a level of sensory blockade to TH 11.	0.9795544537252345
Furthermore vegetative symptoms like hypertension and tachycardia were observed.	0.6507292559034934
For therapy a single bolus of 40 mg dexamethasone was administered intravenously followed by an epidural infusion of sodiumchloride 0,9% 99 cc/h for several hours.	0.9873725396141767
About 6 hours after the start of infusion all symptoms had disappeared.	0.6482840512491789
It is proposed that the use of colour-coded epidural catheter devices and coloured electrolyte solutions as well as infusion-pumps with a larger reservoir that reduce the frequency of syringe changes would be helpful in avoiding such complications.	0.9363213913419779
This paper reviews respiratory muscle/circulation interaction in congestive heart failure.	0.8753853110734696
Respiratory muscle dysfunction consisting of both reduced pressure - generating capacity and reduced endurance is well documented in these patients.	0.9315726048303682
The mechanisms underlying its development and the potential consequences especially in the development of dyspnea are then presented.	0.986334831773013
Not only are respiratory muscles dysfunctioning in these patients, but under specific circumstances they can impede the circulation, such as during weaning from mechanical ventilation.	0.897499324163503
The underlying pathophysiology and the theoretical model explaining this interesting interaction is finally discussed.	0.8330151839638771
Traumatic, perilunate dislocations are rare lesions, and one third of them are associated with perilunate dislocation fractures.	1.0398174479793703
Unfortunately, one quarter of all such fractures go unrecognized, although conventional X-rays can allow their diagnosis in as many as 48% of cases, which can be improved by performing CT or bone scan in addition to 62% and 95%, repectively.	1.2787061311770578
Forced extension seems to be the most frequent trauma mechanism.	1.0946289536696419
The treatment consists of open reduction, predominantly of the lunate bone, and internal fixation.	1.0799827962830544
Huge carpal fragments such as the scaphoid and capitatum are ideally fixed by means of compression screws, while smaller fragments can only be aligned with Kirschner wires.	0.9346668681453499
Osteochondral chips are best reinserted into the bone by means of anchoring systems.	0.7747902268682931
In cases of complex carpal instability supplementary stabilization may be achieved with an external fixator.	1.016557794201953
The best results on the Martini evaluation score were achieved in simple perilunate dislocations that were reset early by open surgical procedures and were accompanied by minimal involvement of/damage to different tissues.	0.9702875033623353
Although we had a nonunion rate of approximately 20% in our series of 11 mixed traumatized patients in all, the Martini classification of hand function seems to be a reliable score system for practical clinical follow-ups.	1.257423153528766
Maternal anxiety in the event of a false positive result is an argument against universal hearing screening in newborns.	0.8884566211513263
The aim of this study was to investigate the mothers' attitudes towards neonatal hearing screening and their anxiety in case of a positive result.	0.989155485337214
Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon- (IFN-) were both administered subcutaneously (SC) in combination with intravenously (IV) applied 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for the treatment of patients with metastasized renal cell carcinoma (RCC).	1.1610292726846518
The therapy protocol consisted of a treatment cycle of 8 weeks, which could be carried out in an outpatient regimen.	1.0983068624281278
The IFN- was given in each of the 8 weeks (6-9 MU/m2 once to three times weekly SC) combined sequentially with IL-2 (5-20 MU/m2 three times weekly SC for 4 weeks) and 5-FU (750 mg/m2 IV weekly for 4 weeks).	1.2277050208767322
Among the 30 consecutive patients treated, in 2 cases a complete, and in 9 cases a partial, remission was achieved in patients with mostly lung and skeletal metastases, with an overall objective response rate of 37 %.	1.2713615284517383
Mean response duration was 8 months (range 3-18 months).	0.9282718290643649
A stable state of the disease lasting 3-18 months was observed in 10 cases.	1.3265705524036613
The side effects were only slight and corresponded to toxicity grade I (n = 2), grade II (n = 22) and grade III (n = 6), according to the WHO classification.	1.245226241203656
In conclusion, this triple-drug biochemotherapy demonstrated significant clinical effectiveness comparable with that of an aggressive IL-2 treatment regimen (applied IV), but without its high toxicity.	1.2613364754933578
Compression therapy was employed for 4 weeks 20 patients with chronic venous insufficiency stage CVI I and CVI II according to Widmer's classification.	1.0097569050272497
Compression bandaging for 2 weeks was followed by compression stockings for 2 more weeks.	0.8104510988527628
The cutaneous microcirculation was evaluated before therapy, after 2 weeks and after finishing compression therapy after 4 weeks.	1.0566341880679098
Marked improvement in symptoms such as pain and itching was observed after 4 weeks, along with a significant reduction in lower limb volume.	0.9791296837402146
Video capillary microscopy revealed an increase in capillary density associated with a decrease in capillary diameter and pericapillary halo diameter.	0.9050500216495093
Compression treatment achieves at least part of its effect by improving the function of the skin microcirculation.	1.0237732592460496
The efficacy of bandaging and stockings was similar.	0.5960916373635944
The splanchnic perfusion is reduced early in the course of any shock.	0.7761317573095246
The mucosa of the gut suffers most as it experiences a high oxygen demand even in the steady state.	0.9545317382365205
The specific arrangement of the micro vessels within the villus of the mucosa exposes the tip of the villus at the highest risk for ischemia, particularly in low flow states.	1.00527155547959
As a consequence the integrity of the mucosal layer is compromised and dysfunction of the mucosal barrier may allow bacteria and toxins to translocate from the gut lumen.	1.0744093918880082
Activation of leukocytes and stimulation of cytokine synthesis may comprise a sustained inflammatory response syndrome.	0.7523105255979717
So far there is a good body of evidence that the splanchnic region may play an important role in the pathophysiological sequence from shock to organ dysfunction.	1.0137969610061133
As pacing impedance is inversely related to pacing current, the increase of pacing impedance additionally decreases pacing current.	0.9044746864012536
Whether the impedance measurement at implantation predicts the outcome during follow-up, was studied in 87 patients who received the VDD-single lead UniPass 425 connected to the pacemaker Unity (Sulzer Intermedics).	0.9976862969360518
The impedance changes between implantation and 6 months follow-up were assessed for each patient.	1.1265802414165624
Similar impedance values were defined, if the two measurements were within a range <= -100 to +100 .	1.278246098856285
Six-months impedance was lower or higher compared to implantation, if the difference exceeded > -100 or > +100 .	1.2095802153791892
At implantation, impedance was 535  +/-  98  (range: 333-811 ) and significantly increased to 604  +/-  160  (range: 361-1150 ) after 6 months.	1.2906985566604205
Mean difference between the two measurements was 69  +/-  162  (range: -336 bis +560 ).	1.3011279849076665
Similar impedance had 43 (implantation: 527  +/-  75 , 6 months: 531  +/-  87 ), lower values 11 (implantation: 660  +/-  83 , 6 months: 494  +/-  73 ) and higher values 33 patients (implantation: 503  +/-  99 , 6 months: 735  +/-  168 ).	1.255887025799481
Compared to the patients with similar impedance patients with lower impedance had a significantly higher impedance values at implantation.	1.1518629395940796
Conclusions: Pacing impedance increased significantly within 6 months after implantation.	1.074034701166088
Pacing impedance changed > 100  in 51% of the patients.	1.0163571037650854
The long-term follow-up of pacing impedance can be predicted generally, but not for the individual patient.	1.2155345661201744
Endothelin has both vasoconstrictor and mitogenic properties and might, therefore, play a role in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes and coronary atherosclerosis.	0.9554784335859364
The aim of the study was to characterize the mechanisms and kinetics of cardiac endothelin-1 (ET-1) release following a local endothelial injury during PTCA (group A) and after sustained myocardial ischemia (group B).	1.1825771015375295
Additionally, the precision of agreement between measurements in coronary sinus and peripheral venous samples should be analyzed.	0.9547178056212859
Since first described in the early 1990s, coronary magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has evolved as a promising noninvasive modality for imaging of the coronary arteries and evaluation of coronary artery disease.	1.2460461566656633
Despite technical limitations, coronary MRA has established value for imaging of anomalous coronary artery and assessment of bypass graft patency.	0.987242695916163
Current research focuses on the development of optimal respiratory compensation strategies, improved spatial and temporal resolution and faster acquisition of image data.	0.8571947148400574
The accurate detection of stenoses and assessment of the severity of coronary atherosclerosis is presently being evaluated with large multicenter studies.	1.024787172343767
With further technique enhancements and more clinical experience, coronary MRA is likely to become the dominant noninvasive modality in clinical cardiology.	0.89393067654476
Which consequences can be ascribed to the intraarticular position of devices in the operative treatment of a slipped capital femoral epiphysis?	0.9241528620650258
Which steps are to define as a standard of a careful procedure?	1.0765994764178837
A digitised three-dimensional (3-D) image of the face has many valuable uses.	1.2337652503189833
These include accurate measurements of facial morphology, clinical documentation and objective analyses of surgical procedures.	1.0155735134704833
A new system presented here, based on stereophotogrammetric techniques, instantaneously captures digitised images using high-resolution cameras.	0.8999115495875304
It has an accuracy of more than 0.5 mm RMS and creates the 3-D image from approximately 20,000 points.	1.0521722406717435
The principles of the image capturing are demonstrated and the potential uses discussed.	0.9602170473212777
Surgical changes of the soft tissue in two patients following orthognathic surgery are also illustrated.	1.0404314269391397
This new capturing and measurement system provides a simple method of determining 3-D changes in soft tissue following surgery and is a useful tool for clinical purposes.	1.0731710226497677
A potential impact of tricyclic antidepressants on oral anticoagulation is controversial.	0.7009769071754813
Phenprocoumon - the most commonly used anticoagulant in Germany - is rarely considered in clinical trials.	1.452252680297071
In the present study, a potential drug-drug interaction between phenprocoumon and tricyclics, causing an alteration in prothrombinemic effects, has been investigated.	1.1417746803762694
To analyse the possible injuries of vertebral segments, especially the disc, after unstable thoracolumbar fractures stabilised with AO internal fixator, we performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the traumatised region after implant removal.	1.209976983048408
There were two aspects of disc degeneration (DD): (1) biochemical changes and (2) structural damage.	1.0337112514027842
MRI detects biochemical processes as one aspect of DD that is often small even in the presence of greater structural damage of the nucleus pulposus caused by fracture.	0.915879501406395
None of the patients presented with structural failure of the anulus fibrosus, which is the essential structural component of the vertebral segments with regard to stability.	1.2579434724064205
We observed biochemical changes more often in the lower of the two fracture-adjacent discs and alterations of discal shape more often in the upper of the two, whereas loss of height concerned both discs to approximately the same degree.	1.2344653596101571
The supporters of upper-disc resection in thoracolumbar fractures justify their procedure among other things with the structural disc damage, such as alteration of shape and loss of height (altogether more frequent in the upper disc).	0.9964786743592896
Our observations that a disc with a structurally altered nucleus pulposus can be biochemically intact and can show an intact anulus fibrosus are arguments in favour of disc preservation.	0.8831807746760062
With regard to the upper disc, the widespread opinion that complete and regular disc damage requires a resection has to be revised.	1.1525211828544246
The question of whether the lower disc should be resected more often because of its greater biochemical changes cannot be answered by the present study alone.	1.138820078617324
Besides the excellent static information in all anatomical structures of the vertebral column available by MRI, a repeat examination in a prone position yields dynamic information on the spinal cord in the case of suspected dorsal adhesions.	1.119222706594845
To study the frequency and clinical aspects of cold urticaria in Central Europe, patient data from a university dermatology clinic and a private dermatology office between 1984-94 were analysed and the patients reexamined if possible.	1.0522559743309516
The incidence of cold urticaria was found to be 0.05%.	1.0896638829965923
Of the 56 patients with cold urticaria (31 women, 25 men), 49 had idiopathic cold urticaria.	1.1500294951135632
The mean age was 41.0 +/- 15.6 year, the mean duration of disease 7.9 +/- 5.8 years.	1.2428516344978637
Atopy was found in 46.5% of patients, and 23.2% of the patients suffered from other types of urticaria (cholinergic, chronic idiopathic, dermographic, aquagenic and heat-induced).	1.0854786131128902
Laboratory examinations were only rarely abnormal.	0.7149098201041626
44 patients were treated with antihistamines, with generally only moderate symptomatic improvement.	1.0250532846096179
Treatment with antibiotics (penicillin, 1-2 mil IU/d over 2-4 weeks, n=18, or tetracyclines, 2 g/d over 2 weeks, n=10) induced full remission in 13 patients and symptomatic improvement in 8.	1.1078832402058532
During an average of 6.5 year-follow-up, 20 of 43 symptomatic patients went into spontaneous remission.	1.109832572854369
The good therapeutic response to antibiotics in this study underlines the need for a better elucidation of the cause of cold urticaria, in view of possible infectious causes.	1.1964320007368645
Background: Since its first implantation as an eyeball replacement in the United States in 1985, hydroxyapatite has been rarely used as an orbital implant in Germany.	1.1046762446624725
The aim of the study was to collect data on long-term tolerance, postoperative complications and the cosmetic end results.	1.016099268039452
A 37-year-old woman had intensive care for 105 days and artificial ventilation for 72 days because of a lung transplantation and multiple postoperative complications.	1.0446970516325778
She developed severe heterotopic ossification of both shoulders, the right elbow and both hip joints.	1.0612394847361
Owing to complete joint stiffness, she was immobilized and unable to eat or drink without help.	0.7680148994093049
Operative treatment was performed in two procedures.	0.9912646700459808
The right shoulder and right elbow were operated on first; the right hip and later the left hip were operated on after recovery from the previous surgical procedures.	1.1075020041252501
After 22 months, there was a good functional result; the patient took part in all activities of daily life and was pain-free.	1.244801316188302
The present knowledge on heterotopic ossifications is summarized, as well as possible prophylactic measurements.	0.9762339788415585
Background: Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) is one of the most common forms of supraventricular tachycardia in the pediatric population.	1.1645833368529834
Patients and methods: 41 children with a mean age of 9.6 (3.7-16) years with recurrent atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) refractory to medical treatment (n=38) and recurrent syncope (n=3) underwent electrophysiologic (EP) study.	1.189995957268007
In all patients dual AV-nodal physiology could be demonstrated during EP study and typical form of AVNRT (mean heart rate 220/min) could be induced by programmed atrial stimulation.	1.1073062819725819
A steerable 7 F ablation catheter was placed at the inferoparaseptal region of the tricupid valve annulus close to the orifice of the coronary sinus with the intention to record a late fractionated local atrial electrogram during sinus rhythm.	0.9834137449858813
Starting at this point radiofrequency current (500 kHz) with a target temperature of 70 °C was delivered with the intention to ablate the slow pathway.	1.0007939218570312
If a slowly accelerated junctional rhythm (<120/min) occurred during energy discharge, programmed atrial stimulation was repeated.	1.043383977543364
Otherwise radiofrequency current was delivered step by step up to a septal position next to the tricuspid valve annulus.	0.8582928935049392
Slow pathway ablation was defined as lack of evidence of dual AV nodal pathways during repeated atrial stimulation.	0.8591814149947121
Slow pathway modulation was defined as maximal one atrial echoimpulse after ablation.	0.7326647669844291
Results: The number of energy applications ranged from 1-19 (median 6).	1.1488052376781597
In 35/41 patients slow pathway ablation could be achieved; in six patients the slow pathway was modulated.	1.00042107828781
In none of the patients permanent high grade AV block was observed.	1.0351416247519565
During follow-up (mean 4.1 years) two patients had a recurrent episode of AVNRT after slow pathway modulation.	1.2593626649289051
All other patients are still free of AVNRT without medical treatment.	0.9256135072619983
Conclusion: Selective radiofrequency current ablation/modulation of the slow pathway is a safe and curative treatment of AVNRT in young patients.	1.065801431839585
Since we had the impression that there was an increase in blood loss during mammaplasties after a change in the anesthesiology department responsible, we conducted a study to compare 28 cases from each anesthesiology department.	1.1747049881531317
All operations were carried out by the first author in succession using the same operative technique.	1.0615086036809496
The two groups did not differ in age, BMI, operative time, weight of resected tissue or preoperative laboratory.	1.1913226395661247
Blood loss was calculated from the perioperative drop in hemoglobin and patient's blood volume.	0.9153535081406989
Blood pressure, heart rate, medication and intravenous fluid supply were obtained from the anesthetic protocols.	0.7849890624915714
Results (means and standard deviations): Group I (n = 28) and [Group II (n = 28)]: total resected tissue 1862  +/-  928 g [1912  +/-  791 g]; Hb-preop.	1.1267777444560236
13.6  +/-  0.9 g/dl [13.8  +/-  0.8 g/dl]; Hb-postop.	1.1550576739397793
10.8  +/-  1.3 g/dl [9.7  +/-  1.3 g/dl] P = 0.006; Blood loss 970  +/-  339 ml [1443  +/-  456 ml] P < 0.001.	1.0913483640849202
After exclusion of surgical or biological causes hemodynamic effects of the anesthetic techniques were suspected as the reason for the significant difference in blood loss.	1.10195506240919
MAP was elevated only initially, while the heart rate was considerably elevated throughout the procedures in group II.	1.2782889621780926
During anesthesia with nitrous oxide and enflurane, the dose of enflurane in group I could be limited to 0.3-0.5 % after initial i. v. administration of 60 to 100 µg sufentanil, while in group II without opioids doses of 0.5-2 % were required.	1.3460114851931393
The well-known dose-dependend effect of enflurane on the peripheral vascular tone was not masked by vasoconstrictors at the operative site.	0.9170791447487558
Conclusions: Blood loss during mammaplasties can be affected considerably by the anaesthetic technique - even without deliberate hypotension.	1.2623909805529256
Sufentanil can indirectly reduce the blood loss by lowering the necessary dose of enflurane.	1.0041724427202994
Blood transfusions can be avoided at mammaplasties.	0.9424428074796511
Continuous epidural infusion of bupivacaine with the opioid fentanyl represents an effective analgesic method in the therapy of strong postoperative pain after major surgery.	1.0228204169759454
Preparation of the required infusion solution in syringes with a volume of 50 ml immediately prior to administration is routinely performed by nursing staff in Germany.	0.8942048735815726
The effort required for the preparation is associated with logistical and pharmaceutical difficulties.	0.8398589221471777
The preparation of a mixture of bupivacaine hydrochloride 0.06% and fentanyl 0.0002% in 250 ml infusion bags at the pharmacy of the University Hospital Mainz is described.	0.9850155699144013
To determine the physicochemical stability, the concentration of bupivacaine-HCl and fentanyl was assessed using HPLC over a period of 32 days; in addition the pH values were determined.	1.0596126671422368
After 32 days 95% of the bupivacaine hydrochloride and fentanyl baseline values were recorded.	1.0531624335955527
The pH baseline value had decreased from 5.48-5.52 to 0.5-0.7 units.	1.2252642211821059
The measured values confirm the physicochemical stability of the mixture of bupivacaine hydrochloride 0.06% and fentanyl 0.0002% over a period of 32 days.	0.8180096552307071
The infusion bag can be stored for 4 weeks at room temperature.	0.747978995461603
The programming of a cochlear implant speech processor used by young children is often difficult, especially when the stimulus level associated with maximum auditory loudness (MAL) needs to be determined.	0.9341167607584946
Excessively high stimulation should be avoided as this can have a traumatic effect.	0.9713899425728781
The aim of this study was to determine if a relationship exists between the intraoperatively determined electrical stapedius reflex threshold (ESRT) and the postoperatively determined MAL and hearing threshold for 27 patients, each having one of three implant types.	1.1077780736670193
The question of whether the ESRT provides a practical technique to simplify, improve and accelerate speech processor programming was investigated.	0.8879804977749385
For the monopolar stimulation mode used for the Med-El and Clarion implant systems, the average MAL and threshold was expressed as a percentage of the average ESRT across all electrodes.	1.0083939436015856
For the "common ground" stimulation mode used for the Nucleus implant system, a parabolic transformation was used to relate MAL and ESRT to one another.	1.0176410025111302
These transformations between MAL values calculated from the ESRT and the actual MAL values, determined psychoacoustically, diverged considerably from one another.	0.9170449986470802
Therefore, it was not possible to determine the MAL from the ESRT with certainty.	1.2452239708840147
The ESRT does, however, provide a means to estimate an approximate upper boundary for the MAL, apart from its use to control implant function.	1.0528862808764319
The determination of the exact MAL will still need to be determined using behavioural techniques.	0.9472159923519078
Movements and vibrations of intraocular structures can be observed during vitrectomy with mechanical cutting systems.	0.871510472852265
We experimentally compared these intraocular motion artifacts between mechanical and erbium:YAG laser vitrectomy.	0.7299722914169755
Spontaneous rupture und false aneurysms of the non-arteriosclerotic aorta are rare.	0.6725391557511254
We report on a 53-year-old patient with false aneurysm due to covered rupture of the thoraco abdominal aorta following sarcoidosis initially repaired by semicircumferential aortic end-to-end anastomosis.	0.9853368520030799
After 6 months local recurrence occurred and the afflicted aorta was replaced by autologous arterial graft, transferring the right iliac artery as aortic patch.	0.9235672306667403
The iliac reconstruction was performed by PTFE interposition.	0.8901709960494887
There was no specific therapy for sarcoidosis.	0.9623876757676056
At 1 year follow-up there was no recurrence and the patient is free of symptoms.	1.2709122104398498
In this biomechanical study the implanted Unreamed Humeral Nail (UHN) has been tested concerning bending and torsional stiffnesses.	0.9300431785823531
In literature other intramedullary implants have been critisized for insufficient rotatory stability especially in transverse and short oblique fractures of the humeral shaft.	0.9151358983410058
This study examined, whether the implanted UHN, as well as the UHN implanted with interfragmentary compression through a specific compression device, is able to augment torsional stiffness significantly.	1.0710262943152145
To evaluate bending and torsional stiffnesses, the UHN has been compared biomechanically to the Russell-Taylor humeral nail (RT) in paired mid-shaft osteotomized cadaveric humeri.	1.0073699866366166
Identic paired comparison has been performed with the UHN without and UHN with interfragmentary compression.	0.8676325172669673
In anterior-posterior, as well as medio-lateral direction stiffness under four-point-bending is significantly higher in stabilizing with the RT.	0.7844458054478093
Under torsional loading with moments of 4 Nm, 6 Nm and 8 Nm the UHN reached more than the double torsional stiffness.	0.8595115154237891
The RT, which is only dynamically interlocked, owns a high initial "play" between bolts and nail itself.	1.0620345808897458
Through additional interfragmentary compression stiffness of the UHN under four-point-bending in anterior-posterior, as well as medio-lateral direction augments significantly.	0.695083852399455
Also under torsional loading with moments of 4 Nm, 6 Nm und 8 Nm torsional stiffness increases with interfragmentary compression significantly.	0.7491930134361451
In comparison to other biomechanical studies of different autorship it is clear, that this statically interlocked intramedullary nailing of the humeral shaft is superior to non-statically interlocked types of nailing concerning their stabilizing potency in torsion and serves especially for fracture types, which are critically under rotation, as transverse or short oblique humeral shaft fractures.	1.0845187965925447
While the different national health systems merge structurally, cost expansion in health care is a global challenge.	0.9420603536141015
Structural reforms have been developed during recent years in the USA which can be summarized as "managed care".	1.0365734824603912
They are characterized by the evolution of an economically orientated system, in which units of medical therapy are generally handled like conventional economical goods.	1.0920116913991451
In managed-care models, patients are deliberately directed to the most economic forms of therapy.	1.0951475191190916
The spectrum of medical interventions as well as diagnostic or therapeutic patterns are predefined by a system of contracted guidelines, which lead to a standardization of processes.	1.0605698250656737
Financing and medical executive responsibilities fuse.	0.5871916031282585
The autonomy of medical decisions is clearly reduced to enforce an integrated and economically oriented steering of the health system.	0.8840784912819828
Leadership is no longer primarily confined to doctors or scientists.	0.8386834191901343
It is progressively shifting to financing institutions, managing directors or insurance companies.	0.6486923047674388
Structural changes currently are expanding rapidly in the U. S. and have meanwhile led to marked regional reductions of medical costs.	0.8842803404805721
Nevertheless, the US model is still far more expensive compared to the German system.	1.1989177157152593
Historical development, current concepts of US-managed care, its potential influence and general applicability to the German situation are discussed in an overview.	1.095845258219361
On the subject of natriuretic peptides there is a great deal of controversy, and intensive research efforts have been made studying their effects on electrolyte homeostasis.	1.1774082445267695
In the early 1980s, a peptide that caused diuresis, natriuresis, and had a relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle was discovered independently by several groups.	1.156113590731938
This was the breakthrough for the identification of natriuretic peptides, followed by the characterisation of the amino-acid sequences of several species.	0.8733707455466935
Synthesis of the peptide, cloning of the encoding gene, identification and characterisation of specific receptors, as well as the development of antibodies and radioimmunoassays were rapidly accomplished.	0.9621358494410391
Research on the immunohistochemistry of cardiodilatin/atrial natriuretic peptide (CDD/ANP) and the regulation of CDD/ANP gene expression led to detection of the peptide in extra-atrial tissues.	1.0855793515820944
Later on, two new peptides were discovered brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP).	0.9718985282350843
These peptides share structural features with CDD/ANP with regard to their 17-amino-acid-exhibiting loop bridged by a disulfide bond.	0.8533285906476699
Another recently discovered peptide is urodilatin (URO), a renal-borne new member of A-type natriuretic peptide.	1.0370157511531504
URO was isolated from human urine and consists of the same sequence as CDD/ANP, containing the 17-amino-acid residue loop of the circulating hormone with 4 additional amino acids located at the NH2-terminus of the peptide.	0.9414709885485103
Regarding physiological actions, data strongly support a close association between URO and urinary sodium excretion.	0.9247287421174707
The application of URO in animals revealed a stronger diuresis and natriuresis with a lower influence on arterial blood pressure compared to CDD/ANP-99-126.	0.9019440711881744
These results were encouraging for the use of URO in clinical trials as a tool to prevent acute renal failure (ARF) in patients following heart transplantation and for treatment of incipient ARF in patients following liver transplantation.	1.1690199737916245
Summarising the results of these two studies, URO represents a new approach for not only prevention, but also for treatment of ARF following organ transplantation.	1.2057006352855637
This opens up new possibilities for the treatment of ARF of other origins in intensive care medicine.	0.7975562636102842

The guideline "Joint Swelling" is addressed to primary care physicians - general practitioners, internists or orthopedists without special experience in rheumatology.	1.0513259910117185
It provides a framework for interviewing patients, as well as for physical, laboratory and imaging examinations and for selection of treatment appropriate to the level of primary care.	1.0736223144862582
Situations which call for urgent evaluation and criteria for referral to rheumatologists are described.	0.7412153816493742
The appendix contains comments on signs and symptoms to differentiate arthralgia from joint swelling and on the diagnostic value of a history of joint swelling without confirmation by the physician.	1.0057191630590079
Further recommendations for the evaluation of patient history and physical and technical examinations are given in a tabular form.	1.0271047633897816
The significance of laboratory and imaging procedures is discussed.	0.8243922194388832
Introduction: Bile duct complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy occur twice to three times more frequently than after an open procedure.	1.0449898043852515
Four different types of lesions may be differentiated by the Siewert classification: postoperative bile fistulas (type I), late strictures (type II), tangential injuries of the bile duct (type III) and defect lesions (type IV).	1.1352546815194655
The diagnostic and therapeutic management is demonstrated in relation to our own experience and the literature.	1.1518887562288218
Methods: Eleven patients (median age 43.8  +/-  17.2) with bile duct complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy were operatively treated between November 1993 and December 1998.	1.1750310306409506
Nine patients (four type-II lesions, five type-IV lesions) were referred from another hospital; 2 defect lesions out of 410 laparoscopic cholecystectomies (0.5 %) were documented in our own patient group.	1.144724657488718
Results: Four patients with late strictures were operatively treated with a hepaticocholedochostomy (n = 2) or hepaticojejunostomy (n = 2) after 14.3  +/-  8.4 months and were discharged from hospital after 10.6  +/-  3.8 days.	1.2935616265860805
In both cases with type-IV lesion and a short defect, an end-to-end anastomosis was successful (hospital stay 11.6  +/-  1.0 days).	1.119383549140075
However, a retrocolic Roux-Y end-to-side hepaticojejunostomy was perfomed in all cases with a larger defect (n = 5; hospital stay 14.8  +/-  2.0 days).	1.196135685347489
The two defect lesions in our own group were detected by intraoperative cholangiography and immediately treated after conversion either with hepaticocholedocho-stomy or hepaticojejunostomy (hospital stay 11.2  +/-  0.6 days).	1.0090716652251617
Conclusions: The incidence of bile duct complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy might be kept down by anatomic preparation, selective intraoperative cholangiography and early consideration of conversion to open procedure.	0.8812510985858651
The clinical course after biliary tract injury can be positively influenced only by a standard diagnostic and operative procedure and by an early transfer to a specialized center.	1.1327786922023224
In the last years the incidence of renal cell carcinoma diagnosis increased about 15-20 %.	1.012036751705367
The main aim of this study was to analyse the reason of the increase of incidence.	0.9685735353460946
In the present autopsy series comprising 23.801 autopsies the percentage of patients who died of renal cell carcinoma is 1,77 % in Jena and 1,55 % in Königgrätz (200.000 inhabitants each).	1.3141036977527956
Over this time the incidence of renal cell carcinoma in autopsies has increased.	0.9333552982243036
With the advent of atypical antipsychotics, quality of life for patients with schizophrenia has improved significantly.	1.0205817082771051
The positive effects are based not only on the compliance-enhancing reduction of extrapyramidal side effects but also due to improved cognitive function and social integration, shorter duration, and overall reduction of hospital treatment.	1.0555245760680905
The mortality of perioperative myocardial infarction is still high and according to recently published data amounts to 17 to 42%.	0.9894712554399391
In the seventies introduction of thrombolytic therapy has led to a dramatic reduction in mortality of non-perioperative myocardial infarction.	0.8772932639390502
However, in the perioperative situation thrombolytic therapy remains to be problematic in most cases because of expected severe bleeding complications.	1.2140913522386574
In the last 4-6 years acute-PTCA has been established in the therapy of acute myocardial infarction.	1.1088387041255618
Up to date no data are available concerning the effect of acute-PTCA on mortality of perioperative myocardial infarction.	0.8669232328363201
Nevertheless it can be assumed, that acute-PTCA will lead to a considerable reduction in mortality of perioperative myocardial infarction.	1.0375096051167227
Therefore, in patients with significant perioperative myocardial infarction immediate coronary angiography and, if indicated, acute-PTCA should be performed.	1.2797156116415056
In principle, thrombolytic therapy is considered to be contraindicated in the intra- or postoperative situation.	1.0278115619252213
However, if coronary angiography and PTCA are not possible, thrombolysis might be taken into consideration, in particular if the expected bleeding complications are small in relation to the expected benefit of thrombolysis.	1.3202098595848326
Since acute-PTCA has been shown to remarkably reduce mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock after acute myocardial infarction, this group of patients should be especially considered.	1.045912106830486
Medical theories and practices concerning illness and health in old age as well as several aspects of society that do influence the aging process are described from a historical perspective integrating classical antiquity, middle ages, and modern times.	0.9858343609208525
From the present state of research it is distinguished between "primary illnesses in old age" and chronical diseases which might principally also begin in younger ages but take a different course in old age.	1.0275860179542295
Even if the frequency of disease and multimorbidity is increasing, negative stereotypes of the aging process have to be invalidated.	1.0843934785392293
Advances in medical sciences are a good pre-condition for increasing physical and mental health in old age.	0.8869257441112639
The analysis of wall motion abnormalities with dobutamine stress echocardiography is an established method for the detection of myocardial ischemia.	0.9475901677065072
With ultrafast magnetic resonance tomography, the application of identical stress protocols as used for echocardiography is possible.	0.94077676992211
Transvaginal ultrasound provides an early and accurate technique to assess first trimester pregnancy.	0.8969486091538823
Beginning with the demonstration of an intrauterine gestational sac, sonography enables further evaluation of normal pregnancy development, such as identification of the embryo, visualization of the yolk sac, and the presence of fetal cardiac activity as a reassurance of fetal viability.	1.0932266178864634
Furthermore it allows closed sonographic monitoring of early intrauterine pregnancy and distinction between normal and abnormal development of pregnancy.	0.8842055240399365
A prediction in terms of pregnancy outcome can be made regarding pregnancy complications or specific risks like vaginal bleeding, the demonstration of intrauterine hematoma, advanced maternal age, early growth delay or fetal bradycardia.	1.0347476965544835
Because of the marked heterogeneity of patient groups and the diverse causes of obstruction, surgical therapy of the small-bowel ileus is difficult to standardize.	1.1709539048659976
A homogeneous strategy of intraoperative handling of the obstructed bowel (decompression, endoluminal splinting) as well as abdominal closure would be desirable.	0.8697966045502932
Adhesiolysis remains the most common procedure.	1.1081881491523031
Small bowel plication is still used by a minority of surgeons with the Noble's technique replaced by the Child-Phillips' technique and its modifications.	0.9138485564992406
However, as a result of the lack of controlled studies, there is no large body of evidence available to support the use of plication, long tubes or any other specific surgical intervention.	1.1930532541234602
This is an important task for the future, especially in view of incidence and economic importance of small bowel-ileus.	1.2331214551285645
Purpose: The purpose of our study was to determine the value of MRI in monitoring laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy (LITT) of cerebral neoplasms.	0.9607347605448091
A 70-year-old woman with severely symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy was unresponsive to drug treatment.	0.7924349593374627
She had recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias and syncope and was at high risk for sudden death; a dual chamber pacemaker defibrillator (DDD-ICS) was implanted.	1.0392525541472286
Her initial left ventricular outflow tract gradient was 80 mmHg and fell to 40 mmHg during dual-chamber pacing at an atrial ventricular delay of 140 ms.	0.9172089312033781
In the follow-up over six months she was asymptomatic with respect to angina pectoris; ventricular tachycardias could be successfully terminated by antitachycardia pacing or by shocks.	0.9410470689906834
A dual chamber pacemaker defibrillator is an important therapeutic option for patients with symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and ventricular tachyarrhythmias.	0.9484992369282288
Morbihan's disease was first reported as a distinct entity in 1957 by Degos, describing a chronic persistent erythema and oedema of the upper half of the face.	1.0553344181094588
Such conditions have been noted in the literature designated as chronic lymphoedema or solid persistent facial oedema in acne or rosacea.	0.9524213281787216
The characteristic features are a chronic course, a typical clinical picture, lack of specific laboratory and histological findings and refractoriness to therapeutic measures.	1.166508840929529
Paediatric cardiac transplantation (pHTX) has gained widespread acceptance as a therapy in end-stage myocardial failure and some forms of congenital heart disease, particularly hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS).	0.976147462189022
The major problems to the anaesthesiologist in these patients are induction of anaesthesia in infants with HLHS and treatment of pulmonary hypertension in the early post-bypass period.	1.3536672986373566
Objective: Thirty years ago, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was primarily developed for otherwise healthy individuals who experienced sudden cardiac arrest.	1.0042845699613927
Today, CPR is widely viewed as an emergency procedure that can be attempted on any person who undergoes a cessation of cardiorespiratory function.	0.9470693193426594
Therefore, the appropriateness of CPR has been questioned as a matter of the outcome, the patient's preferences, and the cost.	1.4361778274132317
The objective of this article is to analyse ethical issues in prehospital resuscitation.	0.9366294838885111
Arguments: CPR is bound by moral considerations that surround the use of any medical treatment.	0.9216924226152194
According to Beauchamp and Childress, the hierarchy of justification in biomedical ethics consists of ethical theories, principles, rules, and particular judgements and actions.	0.9679418948720108
The decision to start CPR is based on the medical judgement that a person is suffering from circulatory arrest.	1.0242615503815669
The decision is justified by the moral rule that the victim of a cardiac arrest has the right to survive and to receive CPR.	1.0680295318032644
Moral rules are more specific to contexts and are based on ethical principles.	0.8806278888646324
The principle of beneficence means the provision of benefits for the promotion of welfare.	0.7399139313539617
Talking about beneficence in resuscitation means once again reporting stories of success, as many victims of pre- and in-hospital sudden death have been saved in the past.	1.1377724416099342
Nevertheless, resuscitative efforts still remain unsuccessful in the majority of cases, involving the principle of nonmaleficence.	1.0369080827860266
There is potential harm in CPR.	0.540187319006227
Survivors may recover cardiac function, but sustain severe hypoxic brain damage, at worst surviving without awakening for months or years.	0.9981158381327744
In particular, post-traumatic CPR is associated with an extremely poor outcome, leading to the issue of futility.	1.0761942345312794
However, futility should be defined in a strict fashion, as there might be an individual chance of survival.	1.2801534812441304
The principle of respect for autonomy means the right of a patient to accept or reject medical treatment, which continues in emergency conditions and after the patient has lost consciousness.	1.2142500836659005
The time frame in CPR requires medical decision-making within seconds, and CPR is usually initiated without the patient's involvement.	1.0330844084693116
If the patient's wish's can be ascertained later on, life-sustaining therapies might be withdrawn at that time.	0.9416949655030106
Terminally ill but still competent patients should be encouraged to write a no-CPR document, which does not deny patients relief from severe symptoms, but might facilitate withholding resuscitative efforts at the scene.	1.0090652009755023
The principle of justice affects priorities in the allocation of health care resources.	0.7541977678815887
The decision made for a particular patient might delay or prevent emergency treatment in other patients who could receive greater benefit.	0.9904446129457696
Conclusions: The standard of care remains the prompt initiation of CPR.	1.1167239194679446
However, ethical principles such as beneficene, nonmaleficence, autonomy, and justice have to be applied in the unique setting of emergency medicine.	1.2308145851370325
Physicians have to consider the therapeutic efficacy of CPR, the potential risks, and the patient's preferences.	1.4031844571835526
Acting within the context of the therapeutic process is often equated with acting-out.	1.0612892798088511
Subtile behaviour, too, as a part of the "complex system of sending and receiving unconscious signals" (Sandler) which serve for the patient to induce behavior of the transference object in the analyst or fulfilling his unconscious wishes is seen as acting-out or microacting-out (Treuniet).	1.1180358733740192
However, this delicate acting has no meaning, it is not symbolic or communicative action.	1.196671117542719
It is aimed at inducing effects and interactions.	0.6090605887213189
It appears both on the side of the analyst and of the patient and is part of the unconscious communication in the therapeutic process.	1.2100230274715935
Diverse interactive means and ways will be demonstrated, how the analyst is moved to unnoticed acting and to handling the patient in an unnoticed manner in a certain way.	1.0113338044140845
The acting-reactions of the analyst may have the character of interpretations, by which he unintentionally demonstrates, in what a way he understands the patient.	1.1081417502636008
Background: The therapy of phimosis is circumcision.	1.1099485019351243
Since many years it has been discussed, whether phimosis is treatable with local estrogen application analogous to the treatment of labial synechia in girls.	1.0340303001535829
This conservative treatment depends on the presence of estrogen receptors (er-alpha) in male prepuce-cells.	0.9962945088661085
Findings in previous investigations have indicated that contrast-enhanced colour Doppler can be used to improve the demonstration of characteristic features of neovascularization in malignancies.	0.9195949090831138
However, the quantification of the increase in colour Doppler signals after Levovist in the cited study relied only on descriptive criteria defined by the investigator, resulting in a subjective scoring system.	1.0344596009503704
A computer-assisted method for quantitative analysis of colour pixel density is a novel approach for objective assessment of colour Doppler signal after contrast media administration.	0.9989351809530355
After microbubble contrast medium injection in 47 patients, carcinomas and benign lesions behaved differently regarding degree, onset and duration of Doppler enhancement.	0.9137274172502236
However, the high interindividual variability and the temporal variations of the Doppler signal still limit the value of these criteria for prospective diagnosis.	1.1468175060257932
Rapid image-acquisition techniques are needed in order to apply the necessary mathematical processing before the contrast kinetics can be used for diagnostic purposes.	1.0679692158206453
Recent studies have shown that increased intraocular pressure following keratoplasty may cause progressive endothelial cell loss and thereby lead to early transplant failure.	0.8385437829037142
This study examined risk groups for development of postoperative glaucoma and thereby transplant failure.	0.900410516782303
Dysphagia is a common complaint following surgical intervention in the oral cavity and hypopharynx, often leading to prolonged postoperative recovery.	1.09237261826526
Videofluoroscopy allows detailed visualization of deglutition, demonstrating the morphology as well as the functional aspects.	1.1301840038179032
Therefore, videofluoroscopy provides the basis for further therapeutic management.	1.2844857140596124
We discuss the pathology of deglutition in 19 patients recovering from tumor surgery of the oro- and hypopharynx.	0.9827013453407338
In most cases the results demonstrated severe impairment of both the oral and pharyngeal phase of deglutition.	1.1403320981510998
Our data emphasize the importance of the oral phase of deglutition for preparation and initiation of the following phases.	1.1439214169906786
People who suffer a stroke most often experience a major crisis in their lives.	0.86022670017567
This leads to psychological problems which are likely to influence the patient's life satisfaction, long-term rehabilitation outcome, and quality of life as much as the physical consequences caused by the stroke.	1.0894614340065574
The patient's ability to accept the new reality created by a disability as a part of their future life is therefore essential.	1.013663205687011
This necessitates an individual coping strategy in the center of which is a mourning process, which unfolds in the same way as other experiences of vital threat, e.g.	1.0525956378592516
confrontation with one's own dying.	0.7352382505432261
Different stages of mourning that can also be found in stroke patients are nonacceptance of the facts, erupting emotions, parting with the former and finding of a new self as well as new perspectives for one's future.	1.0275452291591638
Whether a coping process is successful does not depend on the type of the defense mechanisms or stages, but essentially on their persistence.	0.9954953933491848
It is the task of the therapeutical team to support this process by applying a basic therapeutic behavior, stage-consistent interventions and a positive feedback.	1.1459069489565534
A failed process of coping may be one of the causes of the high prevalence of psychological disorders like depression and anxiety disorders in patients having sufferd a stroke.	1.1208905035535472
A 63-year-old woman developed a pruritic exanthema on the extremities after one hour of work in her garden pond in Planegg, Southern Bavaria.	0.9573873796746555
As the appropriate vectors (ducks and snails) were present, we made the tentative diagnosis of cercarial dermatitis (swimmer's itch).	0.9925506071228739
By different serological methods (cercarial fluorescent antibody test, cercarial Hüllen reaction, circumoval precipitin test) antibodies against cercariae could be demonstrated in the serum of the patient 14 days later.	0.9817542499659406
Cercarial dermatitis appears worldwide, but in Central Europe the disease is often not recognized.	1.2892062781185847
The current adjustment of cochlear implant (CI) speech processors is based on a knowledge of the lower and upper limits (T- and C-levels) for electrical stimulus currents.	1.1410428165104871
These data are usually acquired from subjective classifications of individual patients.	0.8797516847689022
In cases with non-reliable patient responses, objective methods are necessary.	0.7179962750098519
Especially for the estimation of correct T-levels, auditory evoked potentials (AEP) can be applied, since they allow the determination of response thresholds in a frequency-specific manner.	1.0773366204905181
By determining the AEP of different latencies, late cortical responses can be registered almost without artifact contamination.	0.8726981442012978
These patients have been examined in 20 patients provided with 22- or 8-channel CI-systems (Nucleus or Med-El implants).	1.0243899606730984
In all cases, clear responses and clearly discernible threshold transitions could be detected.	0.7937365809172148
By making use of acoustical stimulation in a free sound field, subjective hearing threshold and the T-levels of electrical stimulation could be verified.	0.9591599324880932
Since late responses are generated in the primary auditory cortex, their assessment permits a nearly integral functional control of the aided hearing system.	0.9734549468200205
To date, no problems have occured from maturation or attentional effects in either pediatric or adult patients.	0.9622764065738005
The applicability in very young children remains to be explored.	0.7093254080521345
Laparoscopic gastric banding has become a common procedure in bariatric surgery.	0.8961239572183796
Early as well as late complications are, in comparison to conventional techniques, rare.	1.0996339069005039
Complications arising from the operative technique are: perforation, early pouch dilatation, gastric slippage, infections of the port and the band, erosion and defects of the band tube.	1.048330320125608
Insufficient weight loss and late pouch dilatation arise from unsatisfactory compliance on the part of the patient.	0.8087391375517262
In 7.5 % of 146 cases, reoperations were necessary.	1.121741115549464
Obstruction of the pouch stoma and a slippage resulted in total food intolerance.	0.8363224109462993
After radiologic diagnosis the band system should be deflated first and a naso-gastric tube applied.	0.7366766422103121
If this does not result in the pouch collapsing, a revision operation is needed.	1.0560193716399957
The significant legal and ecomonic ramifications of a positive drug test produce an incentive among users of illicit drugs to escape detection.	0.8177427251306094
Therefore, being the easiest body fluid to handle for drug screening urine is very often manipulated to test clean.	1.0948068198450498
Methods available to cause a negative result range from substitution of urine, adulteration of the collected specimen by various chemical agents and in-vivo manipulations.	0.9838328963792964
Among these, the preferred strategy is to increase fluid intake and urine flow so as to dilute the concentration of drugs below the threshold of detection.	0.9825583685980581
To determine the extent of possible specimen dilution the urinary creatinine concentration is generally determined.	0.8881523323081868
Based on data from uncontrolled and controlled fluid intake studies in the literature and physiological conditions of urinary excretion, the meaningfulness of creatinine concentration in randomly obtained urine samples is discussed.	1.0801340331490554
A low creatinine concentration not clearly proving an intentional dilution of the sample, the application of GC/MS analysis or the concentration of the urine prior to drug screening is recommended for specimens exhibiting a "suspect" urinary creatinine concentration.	1.0141490385038119
Goal: Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring has a key role within the neuromonitoring, although ICP does not monitor processes of the central neuron directly and only with delay.	1.045914761233577
One of the important factors in ICP monitoring is measurement accuracy.	1.0473844517040376
For a better understanding of ICP probes and their differences, the function and principles of intracranial pressure transducers should be evaluated from a technical point of view.	1.0482341714719081
The therapy for spontaneous or artificial perforation of the esophagus remains a controversial matter.	0.9663949039212961
The following case report deals with the medical history of an artificial esophageal perforation after operative treatment of cervical disc disease.	1.0708684052845578
A 68-year-old male patient underwent a C4/C5 and C5/C6 discectomy with interbody fusion of C7-T1 vertebral body, according to Smith-Robinson.	0.8146245025823873
During this operation, a 3-cm-long lesion was made in the posterior wall of the esophagus, which was treated 24 h later with a primary suture.	1.2995928586999996
The clinical follow-up was complicated by mediastinitis with subsequent multiorgan failure.	0.9668189807191913
After recovery from this critical condition the patient complained of severe dysphagia, which was related to a persistent lesion in the posterior esophageal wall with endoscopically demonstrated dislocation of a screw.	1.1626263487502129
After removal of the screw, the lesion was covered by means of sternocleidomastoid myoplasty.	0.9948236914321579
Moderate postoperative dysphagia was successfully treated by bougienage.	0.8499325360024806
Introduction: The loss of functional capacity by peripheral nerve lesion is easy to be estimated: A certain neurologic dysfunction results in a characteristic reduction of the former individual capacity.	1.2052271148127185
In contrast, the effect of accompanying pain to every-day life and working ability is not known exactly.	0.9577196906227153
In this study, we compared the results of judgement in nerve lesions under the circumstances of additional pain syndromes.	1.1084989022564689
The guidelines of the International Union against Cancer are generally used to assess malignancy of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.	1.0439304333990924
Beside TNM-staging, histological grading is performed.	0.8261733789175664
This system has been extended by a selection of histological parameters which were studied with respect to prognosis, based on a review of 184 patients with squamous cell carcinoma.	1.0711779450421777
An increased malignancy was found in carcinomas with the following features: clinical diameter greater than 2 cm, low degree of keratinization, high degree of cellular polymorphism, high mitotic index and high tumor thickness index (metastases only from tumor thickness 2,4 mm and subcutaneous infiltration), desmoplasia and ulceration.	1.148834938874883
Consideration of histological tumor parameters improved prognosis assessment.	0.7188960602132357
Multivariate analyses with large case series are necessary to determine ranks of the prognostic factors.	0.9446220332062203
Therefore, the data analysis of all centers that contribute to the carcinoma registry will make a precise difinition of high- and low-risk carcinomas possible and can thus influence therapy and follow-up procedures.	1.251813243819079
Surgical closure of atrial septal defects can nowadays be performed without preoperative cardiac catheterization.	0.8698856238704443
For a transcatheter closure, however, x-ray exposure has been indispensable.	1.029985897201146
We report a closure of an atrial septal defect under transesophageal echocardiography without fluoroscopy.	0.9555113781304019
In field research, training intensity was tested during three different dances by recording the exercise heart rates.	0.8622284611104613
The subjects (twelve women from 59 to 77 years old) were tested once a week three times, over three minutes with a break of three minutes, three weeks in all.	1.102125574976773
The sequence of the dances changed every week.	0.7268105213136609
Measurement of baroreflex sensitivity is a new method to identify patients after myocardial infarction with a high risk for sudden cardiac death, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.	1.1470762722758954
In this retrospective study the baroreflex sensitivity was obtained noninvasively by measuring the systolic blood pressure with a FINAPRES-device and correlating this with the R-R intervals of the ECG after raising blood pressure with an intravenous dose of Norfenefrinhydrochlorid (Novadral).	1.0150901494872517
According to other investigators a correlation of >0.7 with a significance of p<0.05 was recommended for evaluable results with a baroreflex sensitivity <3 ms/mm Hg being judged as decreased.	1.0836326074556806
We investigated 302 patients (mean age 59 +/- 17 years, 224 males, 78 females).	1.0097147612842028
75% of the investigations showed acceptable results.	1.1260437991151446
In 77 cases (25%) reasonable results could not be achieved.	0.9539827109252306
We found premature ventricular beats to be responsible in 18 investigations (6% of all investigations).	1.2529512769896256
41 (13.1%) of all investigations were not evaluable because of bad correlation for unknown reason.	1.1966471153678093
When we looked closely at these nonevaluable results, we found a significantly higher number of patients with impaired left ventricular ejection fraction (<40%), diabetes or inducible sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia in the electrophysiologic study in this group.	1.2266891201545507
Embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas of the female genital tract usually occur during infancy in the vagina.	0.8472936373367036
Only in rare cases can they be found in the cervix, where they are most commonly seen in adolescence.	1.1332109085231972
Their prognosis seems to be good since the introduction of a combination of surgery and chemotherapy.	0.9107022666549076
We report a case of cervical embryonal rhabdomysarcoma in IRS stage Ia in a 32-year-old female.	0.9214031560876085
After surgical resection and chemotherapy there has been no evidence of disease for 7 months.	1.1016924115731035
The case is compared with the published literature and prognostically relevant features, and possible problems in the differential diagnosis in biopsies are discussed.	1.18655970266288
Between 1987 and 1993, 41 grade 3B open tibial shaft fractures were treated with the unreamed tibial nail (URTN n = 22) or an external fixator (FIX n = 19).	1.0347040188949495
The method of treatment was left to the choice of the operating surgeon.	1.250715586773499
Three below the knee amputations were performed, three patients died, and three were lost to follow-up.	1.2083869809981869
In all, 32 patients were followed up to union or at least for 1 year.	1.0443540055934835
There were no significant statistical differences between the two groups (P<0.2, chi-squared, t-test) with respect to fracture type, fracture location, age, gender or accompanying injuries.	1.1091164464230692
The URTN group showed significantly better results regarding time to full weight-bearing (URTN 11 +/- 4 weeks; FIX 20 +/- 11 weeks, P<0.01 M-W) Mann-Whitney Test, number of reoperations (URTN 1.04; FIX 2.89; P<0.01 M-W), isolated bone grafting (URTN 3/22; FIX 8/19; P<0.05 chi-squared), and average Karlström and Olerud score (URTN 30 +/- 4; FIX 26 +/- 5; P<0.05 M-W).	1.075797335106555
In all, 15/17 URTN patients and only 6/15 FIX patients achieved unlimited walking distance (P<0.01 M-W).	0.906722702627299
Time to bony union, infection, and nonunion were not significantly different between groups.	0.8985728354416115
By varying the light spectrum, impulse length, impulse sequences and fluences, the PhotoDermVL allows a large choice of individual treatment parameters.	1.0071708647670525
Superficial as well as deeper localized vascular malformations (essential telangiectases, port-wine stains, Poikiloderma of Civatte, hemangiomatous malformations) and cosmetically bothering hypertrichosis can be treated successfully with this high intensity polychromatic pulsed light source.	0.9635360421347966
Catheter ablation is an established method to treat paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.	0.9348860750270367
However, the risks of catheter ablation have to bee weight against antiarrhythmic therapy.	1.0354571574059923
With catheter ablation AV-block III °, pulmonary embolism, pericardial tamponade (in some cases followed by death), arterial embolism as well as other complications have been described.	1.2229124726788037
Especially the long term consequences of prolonged fluoroscopy time are an increased risk for fatal malignancies in young patients.	1.0043813011730172
On the other hand the efficacy of antiarrhythmic therapy in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia has been shown.	1.0523748390523404
The risk of proarrhythmia associated with the treatment with class 1 and class 3 antiarrhythmic drugs that has been documented in patients after mayocardial infarction and in heart failure patients cannot be transferred to patients without structural heart disease.	1.109303012164917
It is concluded that drug therapy is still an important form of treatment in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.	1.0998004700518562
Background: Chloroquine keratopathy is known as a disease with epithelial deposits in the cornea.	1.1701065211293875
The appearance of corneal changes does not seem to be related to dose and duration of treatment.	0.7345363255231059
The purpose of this study was to investigate microscopic changes of corneal morphology in patients treated with chloroquine in vivo.	0.9192371716777353
Dermatological rehabilitation treatment can take different forms: climato-therapy, baths, phototherapy and psychosomatic treatments.	0.8484331464267267
Which of these treatments is of most benefit to any one patient depends on his or her illness.	0.8945671397413226
Accordingly, a psychosomatic approach to dermatological illness is indicated mainly when a psychological disorder and a dermatological disease coincide.	0.9738908504563274
In addtion, dermatoses with psychological triggers or overlays, and also depression, pre-existing emotional disorders and special motivation for psychotherapy should be considered for psychosomatic treatment.	1.103866938332576
Finally, patients who are having trouble accepting or confronting malignant skin tumours may also benefit.	1.216196619250852
We report about the possibility of electrophysiological diagnosis and therapy in the treatment of a symptomatic left ventricular tachycardia which could not be treated effectively by oral medical therapy in a 10 year old boy with no obvious structural heart disease.	1.1702749016416862
By right bundle-bloc-like QRS-complexes in the surface-ECG, the diagnosis of the ventricular origin of the tachycardia was confirmed by transesophageal-ECG.	1.091901822429676
This was followed by the first electrophysiological examination that showed increased leftventricular vulnerability.	0.9361483135335771
During this electrophysiological examination the tachycardia was terminated by stimulated singular premature beats.	0.716625087817689
An oral medical therapy with sotalol was started.	0.6960223649153543
After the phase of saturation the next ventricular stimulation was done, that showed no sufficient protection of sotalol against VT.	0.9856990304252436
So the decision was made for ventricular ablation.	0.7890342670474982
After 5 high frequency-applications no furhter ventricular tachycardia could be induced.	0.7815163570520853
Since this intervention the patient lives without symptoms.	0.7281352272743195
The vertebral bodies and vertebral arches show a characteristic distribution of cortical and cancellous bone.	0.833213090031015
The pedicles are loaded by uniplanar bending that is reflected by the arrangement of the Corticalis.	0.7483543025512465
The ligaments of the vertebral column consist of longitudinal and (with exception of the lig.	1.2302030020178425
longitudinale anterius) horizontal/oblique segmental ligament bundles.	0.6799127289086185
In combination with the anulus fibrosus, the ligaments work as a kind of gear system.	0.9225585014596924
They regulate the process of movements of adjactent vertebral bodies in a very precise manner and control the final phase of motion.	1.0066466247820471
Besides maintaining the necessary amount of pretension the intervertebral disc distributes the loads uniformly onto the adjacent vertebral bodies.	0.7530136294716422
The intervertebral joints are important for guided motion, by restricting the extent in specific planes and directions.	1.0312558846681326
Because of their position, they are able to take up the shear forces and to simultaneously restrict them in different planes.	1.01948067218751
The integrity of the fascia thoracolumbalis warrants the protective function of the autochthonuos muscles.	0.790991675234639
Prolonged immobilization or physical inactivity has been shown to produce increased bone resorption due to enhanced osteoclastic activity and diminished bone formation.	0.9045586961809247
These skeletal changes are a typical complication in tetraplegic patients, who are at risk of developing hypocalcemia.	1.0734794242700068
Hypercalciuria is the most characteristic symptom.	0.9564509282920942
Risk factors for development of malignant melanoma have been investigated in several case control studies during the last decade, with some variation in results, partly with geographical region.	1.1190825668605775
Four studies have been conducted under the auspices of the Central Malignant Melanoma Registry of the German Dermatological Society; these have yielded consistent results allowing the identification of risk factors for melanoma development.	1.0386101521738356
The numbers of common melanocytic naevi, of atypical melanocytic naevi and the frequency of actinic lentigines were found by multivariate regression analysis to be the most important independent risk factors for melanoma development.	1.0285830872614505
Additional factors were hair colour, skin type and a history of naevus growth.	0.9172904218297214
A classification of relative risks was established by considering the first three risk factors mentioned, without any clear improvement of classification when further additional significant factors were taken into accout.	1.0552439831105536
For example, in individuals with more than 50 common melanocytic naevi, 5 or more atypical melanocytic naevi and simultaneous presence of actinic lentigines the risk of developing melanoma was found to be 100-fold that in persons with 10 common melanocytic naevi or fewer and without atypical melanocytic naevi or actinic lentigines.	1.0822640698052395
Early recognition of melanomas may be substantially improved if these risk factors are considered.	0.8922228510555054
Furthermore, intermittent intensive sun exposure (sunburns as indicator) before the age of 20 induces the development of melanocytic naevi, and after the age of 20 it contributes to the development of actinic lentigines; both factors are associated with an increased risk of melanoma development.	1.2005459103747569
Problem: Clinical and ultrasound data of neonatal hips were analysed to answer the question whether a neonatal screening is necessary or not.	1.0968134488353478
Method: Children born between 1.	1.0600889454938134
1995 were examined clinically and by ultrasound.	0.7658175412746291
The data were analysed by SPSS/PC.	0.8704782883679485
Results: 5069 children with 10 138 hips were examined.	0.9568488534947833
85 % were mature (type I), 14 % were physiologically immature (type IIa) and 1.2 % were pathological (IIc, D, IIIa).	1.4559673135666789
The comparison shows, that from 119 hips with pathological ultrasound findings only 44 (37 %) had positive clinical findings.	1.1145035170661446
A screening that is restricted to children with positive risk factors (positive family history or breech position) would result in half of the newborns with pathological hips not being treated in time.	0.9332363338705586
The interpretation of three-dimensional (3D) structures of the coronary tree and the myocardium by a clinician demands a subjective visual integration of two-dimensional (2D) images of cardiac diagnostic procedures like coronary angiography and myocardial scintigraphy.	0.9955378800779725
Although in the conventional analysis of 2D display scintigraphic myocardial perfusion segments are arbitrarily assigned to three major coronary artery systems, the standard myocardial perfusion distribution territories correspond with the individual pathologic-anatomic coronary tree in only 50-60% of the patients.	1.0204026057895208
Hence, the mental integration ob both 2D images of coronary angiography and myocardial scintigraphy does not necessarily allow an accurate assignment of particular myocardial perfusion regions to the corresponding vessels.	1.0209768830879589
For an objective assignment of each vessel segment of the coronary tree to the corresponding myocardial regions, we have developed a 3D "fusion image" technique and applied it to patients with coronary artery disease.	1.1163551345370193
Cause-and-effect relationships may be more obvious with 3D data fusion and may enable an easier comparison of anatomy and physiology.	0.8808406199721436
The physician's duty of professional discretion is one of the basic tenets at the heart of the doctor's profession.	1.01539187262025
It is laid down in the physicians' professional code and determined ultimately by the patient's right to self-determination, which is regulated in §203 of the German Criminal Code.	1.118543148301224
It is established in the ordinance governing physicians' work and has its origin in the patient's right of self-determination.	1.034632991922028
It is also regulated in §203 of the German Criminal Code.	0.7725602185874267
An exception can be made to the duty of professional secrecy if a patient gives express permission for this or if it is allowed or required by law.	1.0165345545136864
Some such exceptions are also specified in the German Social Code, although the physician's duty of disclosure is then always precisely stated, particularly when medical data in the strictest sense of the phrase are concerned.	1.133789872387549
Borderline cases are described to illustrate how the rules of professional medical discretion are breached in the course of day-to-day business transacted between the statutory accident insurance firms and the physicians under contract to them, and some hints are given on how this can be avoided.	1.0400721156876012
We report on a 56-year-old renal allograft recipient receiving cyclosporin A immunosuppression.	0.8987766754669567
During this therapy he subsequently developed the following cutaneous neoplasms: squamous cell carcinomas, basal cell carcinomas, Bowen's disease, actinic keratosis, sebaceous hyperplasia, a dysplastic naevus and, finally a nodular malignant melanoma.	0.9386259766652668
Adverse effects of the cyclosporin A therapy are discussed, with special reference to dermatologic effects and the implications for patient and doctor.	1.2116546756438238
With Multislice Spiral Computed Tomography (MSCT), existing indications for performing CT of the chest are strengthened and new applications are emerging.	1.1183598191862243
The high speed of MSCT improves efficiency, image quality and patient comfort of "routine"- imaging of the chest.	1.1481197037813333
The ability to cover large volumes with thin slices improves the evaluation of mediastinal lymph nodes and pulmonary nodules and allows for high-quality secondary reconstruction.	1.0148993051980657
If a comprehensive diagnosis of the mediastinal structures and the pulmonary parenchyma is desired, MSCT for the first time allows reconstruction of contiguous and high- resolution (HRCT) sections from the same set of thin-collimation raw data.	1.117921452965063
This way, contiguous chest images of superior and HRCT sections of equal image quality compared to conventional CT scanning can be obtained.	0.8868410760636262
Vascular protocols greatly benefit from the high speed of MSCT: For imaging the thoracic aorta or pulmonary emboli (PE), the amount of contrast material can be substantially reduced.	1.0605609010248942
Owing to thin collimation, the detection-rate of small peripheral emboli can be significantly increased.	1.0057770565711814
If indicated, the entire subphrenic venous system can be evaluated during the same session, without additional contrast material.	1.092828678519194
Abstract   Basis of the modern shoulder implants is the Neer II-system, a non constrained total shoulder prosthesis with conforming radii of curvature and improved protection against dislocation.	1.1241452410697668
The second generation of shoulder prosthesis is based on the geometric shaft design of the Neer II prosthesis and offers not only a variety of modular head- and shaft-sizes but also through different radii a physiologic rotation-translation-mechanism.	1.0180810379388894
The third generation of humeral head prosthesis carries the concept of an anatomic reconstruction one step further and enables the surgeon to adjust the inclination and the eccentric offset of the humeral head to restore the centre of rotation.	0.9836770543025594
The latest development in shoulder arthroplasty are humeral head prosthesis with a fully variable 3-dimensional modularity to independently adjust the prosthestic head position regardless of the individual shaft geometry.	0.9635466035087412
This achieves a 3-dimensional adaptability of the prosthetic head about the stem axis in the coronary and in the sagittal plane.	1.1384521053634102
Besides of the humeral shaft prosthesis an alternative concept of shoulder joint replacement is established - the replacement of the humeral head articular surface.	1.185876495199895
A hemispheric surface prosthesis - cup arthroplasty - is cemented onto the residual humeral head, which eliminates the obligatory humeral head resection and the reaming of the medullary canal.	1.0905381975583297
Bipolar shoulder prosthesis are humeral shaft prosthesis with a bi-rotational head system.	0.780576378892407
Their indication is limited to pre-existing lesions of the rotator cuff and/or the glenoid surface.	1.0566265354559805
The inverse total shoulder prosthesis reverses the articular surface morphology of the humeral head and the glenoid.	0.9868891388201197
The hemispheric glenoid component serves as the centre of rotation for the concave epiphyseal proximal humerus component.	0.8349607383534237
This implant is especially used in cases of massive rotator cuff deficiences.	0.8757934587434312
The role of shoulder prosthesis in treating acute humeral head fractures needs special consideration.	0.8445999102849874
A fracture prosthesis has to restore the exact length of the humerus, the centre of rotation, and the anatomical retroversion.	1.2773383920143373
Positioning of the tubercula and their adequate osteosynthesis is most critical and fundamental to ensure a correct healing process.	0.8968798452424359
A failed consolidation of the tubercula does not lead to a satisfying result.	0.8165120826355263
The shoulder joint replacement can be sufficiently fixated in cemented, cementless or hybrid techniques.	0.9730147030076357
Today several component design variations of cemented glenoid implants exist.	0.6789568530051571
Their main distinction is the fixation system which can be divided into two main groups - the keel - and the peg-shaped glenoid components.	1.3947857186191062
The peg-shaped anchorage system shall guarantee a greater stability against shear-forces.	0.7362572476853354
Cementless glenoid components consist of a polyethylen inlay and a surface treated metal-back with an integrated fixation system.	0.8645355467969235
These fixation systems are object of intensive biomechanical research and range from conventional screw fixation to specialised cone systems and self-cutting cage-screw-systems.	0.8965658011435059
The critical area of cementless glenoid components is the transition zone of the PE-inlay and the metal-back because of high force development.	0.9433521272720685
The question of implanting a hemi- or total shoulder prosthesis is answered by the morphologic changes of the glenoid articular surface, which includes the size of the subchondral defect and the underlying etiology of the shoulder joint disease, and the age of the patient.	1.357181080587192
Preoperative planning must consist of an adequate radiologic work-up - X-ray, CT or MRI - to accurately assess the glenoid morphology.	1.2182766149510742
G. Walch categorised the different glenoid lesions and developed a very important classification of possible glenoid deformations.	1.0241507342142813
To compare and evaluate the operative results one must consider the different shoulder prosthesis and the discrepancies between a hemi- and a total shoulder prosthetic replacement.	1.1631442256769138
Looking at the loosening and survival rate of the implant the results are related to the type of prosthesis and the preoperative diagnosis.	1.219728501487033
The Neer total shoulder prosthesis has a 15 year survival rate of 87 %, compared to 74 % of the hemi-prosthesis.	1.216820288623168
The objective for the future has to be to further advance the development of prosthetic components, especially for primary joint replacement in acute humeral head fractures.	1.15605145257519
Another point of interest is how to reduce the still existing high loosening rates of the glenoid components.	0.9708219902556025
A fairly new research-field is the computer-assisted surgery, e. g. navigation systems and robotics.	0.9422456946041124
The computer-assisted navigation could be of great advantage to accurately find the individual resection plane (inclination and restroversion) of the humeral head.	1.0969264936180774
The use of a surgery-robot could be very helpful to reproducibly achieve the desired conformity of the articular surface when preparing the glenoid.	1.0079721240626802
Two patients with complete paralysis of the axillary nerve are reported on.	1.0334482530829108
One case is well documented.	0.7761094784821815
In both cases there was very good functional adaptation, resulting from hypertrophy of the rotator cuff so that there was only a slight or no loss of movement.	1.0911130354004037
The rotator cuff should therefore be exercised at an early stage when there is isolated axillary nerve damage.	0.9908619952385456
The function of the supraspinous muscle is also discussed.	0.6535310931075806
Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach (1792-1847) is generally known as the founder of modern plastic surgery.	0.9386412275101957
One focus of his work, apart from the physiology of transplantation and operative techniques, was reconstructive oral and maxillofacial surgery.	1.023257304447613
This special aspect of plastic surgery as well as Dieffenbach's biography is presented in this historic article.	0.8442363953239491
When a lifeless person is found in a bath tub, the emergency physician is obliged to give medical assistance.	1.0640692335662685
If the patient is dead on arrival, the manner of death will in most cases unsettled.	1.0649188708837478
In these cases the physician should inform the police immediately.	1.0275439384148863
Any alteration of the scene of death should be avoided.	0.8216549479497097
The purpose of this review is to outline the laparoscopic-endoscopic procedures that we perform for early gastric cancer.	0.8715588067071598
These procedures were applied to 29 patients.	0.8218857888244175
Preoperative work-up included gastric endoscopy, barium X-ray examination, endoscopic ultrasonography, and histological examination, and surgery was performed in patients diagnosed as having mucosal gastric cancer for which endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) was difficult.	1.1832482286817727
Laparoscopic wedge resection of the stomach using the lesion-lifting method, by which a wedge resection is made while pulling up the full-thickness gastric wall, was carried out in the 16 patients with lesions of the anterior wall, lesser curvature, and greater curvature of the stomach.	1.1633507409970485
On pathological examination of resected specimens, the surgical margin and lymphatic or venous invasion were negative in all these patients.	1.0659764852365938
The histological depth of the lesions was m (mucosal cancer) in 15 patients and sm1 (slight cancer infiltration into the submucosal layer) in one.	1.2066975434735572
This one patient later underwent gastrectomy but no lymph node metastases were found.	0.8576428895929608
Oral nutrition was resumed for a mean ( +/-  SD) of 2.9  +/-  0.8 days after operation, and the duration of hospitalization after operation was 12.3  +/-  3.4 days.	1.157647808641192
The 13 patients with lesions of the posterior wall of the stomach and near the cardia or the pylorus received laparoscopic intragastric mucosal resection.	0.8865696270636458
Laparotomy was required in 1 of these patients due to intraoperative hemorrhage.	1.0497315508591032
The surgical margins were negative in all 12 patients in whom laparoscopic intragastric mucosal resection was successful.	0.9603436220068079
Lymphatic or venous invasion was positive in 2, both of whom had sm1 cancer lesions of both of these patients were located in the cardiac region, total gastrectomy was avoided, and careful observation is continued.	1.2189314999348053
Oral nutrition was resumed 4.0  +/-  1.6 days after operation, and the duration of hospitalization after operation was 12.0  +/-  3.5 days.	1.1407137459945977
In addition, no postoperative complication was noted after either procedure, and all patients have been recurrence free for a follow-up period of 460 months.	1.2565193379080317
Selected properly, these laparoscopic endoscopic procedures are considered to be curative and minimally invasive treatments for early gastric cancer.	0.8978479255300654
Between 1988 and 1997, tumor resection was carried out in 18 irradiated patients (group 1: 36-72 Gy, 83 implants) and 22 nonirradiated patients (group 2: 92 implants) in the mandible and floor of the mouth, and these patients subsequently underwent mandibular endosseous implant rehabilitation.	1.2625886353993712
A total of 23 patients were treated with exclusively implant-supported prostheses, and 16 with implant tissue-supported constructions.	1.0936725075491456
