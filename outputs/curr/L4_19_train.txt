There was a reorientation from the middle of the 1970 s as a result of more effective therapeutic possibilities.	0.5653354658152694
A variety of complementary institutions, outpatient and partly inpatient therapies, which were recommended by the "Psychiatrie-Enquête", started to be realized.	0.5899054520708678
Smaller units and different models of integration of psychiatric care, such as building the hospital next to a general hospital or psychiatric wards within a general hospital, became relevant criteria for planning the construction of psychiatric hospitals, as did the integration into the community and the city.	0.5843267683810157
Principles of organization like the construction of a communicative quiet inner room, or grading the rooms from public to private, were structurally integrated.	0.49995631405084684
Specific structural requirements for the construction and design of psychiatric hospitals should be evaluated in more detail by post-occupancy methods.	0.5662812422990366
The coronal incision is a versatile approach to midface or skull base fractures.	0.3032139687164648
It allows the open reduction of complex fracture sites and facilitates canthopexy, marginotomy or calvarian bone harvesting.	0.39657545180635373
By this method, primary treatment can be optimised and the rate of secondary corrective surgery can be reduced.	0.6292819289351127
All trauma patients who underwent this kind of intervention were re-examined to check functional and aesthetic results.	0.5112337577251387
The complication rate was low and the advantages of these techniques are evident, so that it is suggested that the indication for this operative approach should be extended.	0.7657207918748001
One case of a newly described, rare odontogenic tumor is reported.	0.6767778440387856
A literature review of 19 cases lends support to the odontogenic origin and metastatic capability, both regionally and distantly, of the clear cell odontogenic tumor.	0.5833284569135948
We conclude that this tumor is malignant, with a tendency to recur locally after surgery.	0.6990632761391118
It requires an aggressive surgical approach and should be referred to as a clear cell odontogenic carcinoma.	0.5914763222451194
In our patient we saw a clear cell odontogenic carcinoma and a squamous cell carcinoma, both with regional lymph node metastasis.	0.7037910924135152
The histological differentiation of this type of tumor from other clear cell tumors is difficult.	0.4877348819497703
As the elderly segment of our population expands, there is an increase of therapeutic problems considering this age group.	0.6089580948234317
The elderly patient is generally susceptible to infections because of the decline in host defense mechanisms that occurs with aging, and the underlying chronic diseases of these patients.	0.6677444678588403
Increasing numbers of elderly people are being treated in hospitals and are additionally at particular risk of acquiring nosocomial infections with antibiotic-resistant organisms.	0.5382717233758461
This article focuses on the epidemiological considerations, risk factors, types of infections that occur in elderly patients, and the guidelines for empiric therapy.	0.6318103392937514
The most common infections of the elderly are respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, and skin and soft tissue infection.	0.82442581782918
Empirical therapy should be broader in spectrum for elderly patients since the variety of infecting bacteria tends to be greater and the choice of antimicrobial therapy must be based on risk stratification (age, medical illnesses, and severity of presentation).	0.5782230112073568
Many additional aspects, e.g., route of administration, drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, drug toxicity and drug-drug interactions, compliance, and multiple underlying diseases (e.g., renal failure) must be considered in the rational selection of antibiotic regimen.	0.648853242895379
We present long-term results (minimum follow-up 5 years) in 145 patients with advanced non-seminomatous germ cell tumours, who underwent radical retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy (RPLA) after chemotherapy.	0.7764670975156174
We correlated patients' outcomes (death of disease) to different kinds of chemotherapy and to intraoperative findings.	0.5775539030219697
We found that patients who were treated by a modified Einhorn scheme with cisplatin, etoposide and bleomycin have a good prognosis.	0.6397495423919182
In all, 90 % showed no evidence of disease (NED).	0.7641906681166871
The NED rate was significantly lower in patients who were treated by sequential alternative chemotherapy (DOD = 37 %).We determined the following prognostic factors which predict a poor outcome:...	0.8353570042828018
Follow-up studies after stent implantation of native coronary arteries have reported reduced rates of angiographic restenosis.	0.5729954300046733
In contrast, stent implantation in the treatment of obstructive disease of coronary artery bypass grafts is complicated by higher restenosis rates.	0.6497806405215565
We sought to determine, if different predictors contribute to the high restenosis rate following stent implantation of coronary artery bypass grafts.	0.7424294887431664
We investigated long-term angiographic outcome of 205 stent implantations performed in 177 patients.	0.39271892671534486
Multivariate analysis correlated clinical, procedural and angiographic variables with the incidence of angiographic restenosis defined as diameter stenosis >50% at follow-up.	0.5538638402915034
Angiographic restenosis was observed in 34% of lesions treated.	0.7756350132030723
Multiple logistic regression analysis defined diabetes mellitus (OR 6.89, CI2.41-9.69), graft recanalization (OR 2.69, CI 1.08-6.63), lesion at the aortic anastomosis (OR6.98, CI2.76-19.25), lesion at the coronary anastomosis (OR 2.95, CI1.18-7.49), high diameter stenosis after stent placement (OR 7.01, CI 2.64-15.71), placement of long stents (OR2.78, CI1.11-7.36) and implantation of more than one stent (OR7.34, CI2.08-20.15) as independent predictors of graft in-stent restenosis.	0.6273228214776535
Critical consideration of these variables may help to identify patients who are poor candidates for stent implantation and who may benefit from different interventional approaches.	0.6898650970124662
To compare the conventional 2-D, the simulator-guided semi-3-D and the recently developed CT-guided 3-D brachytherapy treatment planning in the interstitial radiotherapy of breast cancer.	0.7080223200174314
In 103 patients with T1-2, N0-1 breast cancer the tumor bed was clipped during breast conserving surgery.	0.4660616279574108
Fifty-two of them received boost brachytherapy after 46 to 50 Gy teletherapy and 51 patients were treated with brachytherapy alone via flexible implant tubes.	0.4540579948842036
Single, double and triple plane implant was used in 6, 89 and 8 cases, respectively.	0.6695133109641113
The dose of boost brachytherapy and sole brachytherapy prescribed to dose reference points was 3 times, 4.75 Gy and 7 times 5.2 Gy, respectively.	0.6022245094676644
The positions of dose reference points varied according to the level (2-D, semi-3-D and 3-D) of treatment planning performed.	0.791241530436332
The treatment planning was based on the 3-D reconstruction of the surgical clips, implant tubes and skin points.	0.6925226079475707
In all cases the implantations were planned with a semi-3-D technique aided by simulator.	0.6093661419867664
In 10 cases a recently developed CT-guided 3-D planning system was used.	0.6355575297938447
The semi-3-D and 3-D treatment plans were compared to hypothetical 2-D plans using dose-volume histograms and dose non-uniformity ratios.	0.5828173710474439
The values of mean central dose, mean skin dose, minimal clip dose, proportion of underdosaged clips and mean target surface dose were evaluated.	0.5129722166494823
The accuracy of tumor bed localization and the conformity of planning target volume and treated volume were also analyzed in each technique.	0.5289196214676977
With the help of conformal semi-3-D and 3-D brachytherapy planing we could define reference dose points, active source positions and dwell times individually.	0.47065734323592534
This technique decreased the mean skin dose with 22.2% and reduced the possibility of geographical miss.	0.7312370302320106
We could achieve the best conformity between the planning target volume and the treated volume with the CT-image based 3-D treatment planning, at the cost of worse dose homogeneity.	0.6593191067319911
The mean treated volume was reduced by 25.1% with semi-3-D planning, however, it was increased by 16.2% with 3-D planning, compared to the 2-D planning.	0.9092151579081084
The application of clips into the tumor bed and the conformal (semi-3-D and 3-d) planning help to avoid geographical miss.	0.5531160484678412
CT is suitable for 3-D brachytherapy planning.	0.7683064228815755
Better local control with less side effects might be achieved with these new techniques.	0.5437258795965649
Conformal 3-D brachytherapy calls for new treatment planning concepts, taking the irregular 3-D shape of the target volume into account.	0.6774465467447021
The routine clinical application of image-based 3-D brachytherapy is a real aim in the very close future.	0.6192740381610679
Background: Staphylococci represent an important source of external infections of the eye.	0.4725645977000271
In addition to acute staphylococcal conjunctivitis a spectrum of subacute or chronic disease may be found.	0.5376605833960918
According to Valenton und Okumoto, with this staphylococci-associated blepharo-kerato-conjunctivitis in culture-positive cases S. aureus is found in 31% and S. epidermidis in 69% of smears.	0.6729277102391035
Microbiallergic and toxic mechanisms are the underlying etiology.	0.38404074570619845
Multiple organ failure (MOF) may occur early or late after trauma.	0.5582784414062596
Besides direct physical injury of organs, compromise of the microcirculation by inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of MOF.	0.42059041445170586
Inflammation also induces counterregulatory responses which may end up in immunoparalysis.	0.29786936445512896
As a result, infection and sepsis with additional inflammatory damage to the microcirculation ensue thereby contributing to the late development of MOF.	0.5121794429029302
In addition to this biphasic model of posttraumatic MOF, there is evidence that inflammation and immunoparalysis do not only occur in sequence to each other but in parallel early after surgical procedures.	0.5844554769733754
The aim of the present brief review is to summarize the posttraumatic mechanisms of inflammation and immunoparalysis and to discuss how to differentiate between both pathophysiologic states.	0.7216778403152243
Early enteral nutrition is widely accepted for its support of organ structure and function ("gut injury hypothesis") and reduction of infectious complications and hypermetabolism in critically ill postoperative or postinjury patients.	0.6424586959725256
Nineteen severely injured patients (Injury Severity Score 40.3+/-11.6) were studied for the feasibility of early enteral nutrition via a duodenal feeding tube.	0.6575342919447617
Despite maxillary fractures, rhinoliquorrhea and blunt abdominal trauma the enteral feeding was mostly started immediately after trauma.	0.3656306897931542
Intermittent diarrhea or constipation resolved after reduction of the feeding rate within 1 or 2 days.	0.47910298237276006
Total enteral nutrition could not be realized in all cases; a central venous line was always additionally necessary.	0.6809282618444551
However, the goal was not complete enteral nutrition but a continuous enteral supply to maintain the integrity of the gut.	0.6313617348498507
The study has shown that early enteral nutrition via a duodenal feeding tube is also feasible in severely injured patients.	0.4319592064206896
The expenditure to overcome the technical and organizational problems seems to be justified.	0.5656191609114792
Enterally fed patients may have a better outcome that those in whom only parenteral is employed.	0.6232689649889201
Definition of the problem: The rapid pace of medical progress has drawn renewed attention to the various possible ways of treating dead or brain-dead pregnant women since the 1980's.	0.5516197604319936
The discussion today revolves around medical, social, legal and economic aspects.	0.49721886899129725
The historical areas of conflict which surrounded deliveries carried out on dead mothers (usually by means of a Sectio in mortua, nowadays known as a perimortem Caesarean section) and their significance in today's debate are, for the most part, regarded as being of little relevance.	0.6390873900451777
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is one of the most frequent infectious lung diseases in immunocompromised patients, especially in AIDS cases.	0.6964512523506302
The present case report describes pulmonary miliary microcalcifications with and without foreign-body reaction in a patient with successfully treated PCP who was known to have AIDS.	0.6334213760179285
This form of residues of completely healed PCP tends to be rare.	0.3994839365639757
Other infectious granulomas, foreign-body granulomas and sarcoidosis must be differentially diagnosed.	0.4021865515863013
After cautious decalcification, pneumocysts can be demonstrated with methamine silver (Grocott).	0.33893849865191594
It is important to be aware that PCP can also undergo spontaneous cure, so that miliary microcalcifications may then be the sole pointer to the presence of AIDS.	0.508454864326148
Background: In congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency high pre- and postnatal androgen levels are present and might influence psychosexual and psychosocial development in affected girls.	0.5040586504384155
Methods: In order to study the impact of high androgen levels as well as chronic medication and repeated surgery on female patients life we performed a comprehensive quality-of-life study.	0.5796767318900202
We report on the results obtained by structured interviews of adult patients (45) and their mothers (35) covering difficulties and problems in general, most aspects of their medical histology, self image, body image and current life with or without a male or female partner.	0.8342907033231564
Results: The patients were socially competent with a well developed social network.	0.7061863407873354
However, regarding sexual contacts they were shy and reluctant.	0.39993310991976144
These resulted in significantly less patients live with a partner or are married.	0.34865934750234334
Existing partnerships were more stable and satisfactory than in the control population.	0.631691162074818
The incidence of homosexuality was not increased.	0.3353449522871853
The number of women having children was significantly reduced.	0.43018573244754404
A substantial number of women suffered from androgen-dependent problems like irrgular menses and hirsutism.	0.3539738984235154
Mothers and patients denied any sex-specific eduction, but the girls had preferred boy-specific toys and competitive outdoor games.	0.4835959743911009
However, school performance was average and comparable to the controls.	0.6053757441297211
Most mothers expressed problems and questions regarding their daughters intersexuality at birth.	0.25792087460001006
Even though they felt they had received good medical treatment, mothers as well as patients felt they would have needed more psychological help.	0.4453133592815179
Conclusions: It seems that adult female patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia are able to adapt to their impairment and chronic disease.	0.6136554281043559
Problems regarding partnership, sexuality, and fertility remain and have to be addressed.	0.5685447756807022
Introduction: Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) has become an accepted treatment for end-stage liver disease.	0.6289154660942452
However, postoperative complications result in significant patient morbidity and mortality.	0.5559001331486944
Early detection and treatment of these complications is therefore of utmost importance.	0.6844341985426754
Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the postoperative complications of the patients who underwent OLT at our institution.	0.924572876140957
Duplex Doppler sonography and cholangiography were the primary imaging modalities in postoperative evaluation of the transplanted liver.	0.709747887344731
Other important techniques were CT, MRI, and angiography, which may contribute to a reliable diagnosis of vascular or biliary complications.	0.7944928768831261
Results: Second to primary organ dysfunction, vascular complications are the most frequent cause of graft loss.	0.6673772143441906
Thrombosis of the hepatic artery is the most common and most serious vascular complication, with a reported incidence from 4 to 42 %.	0.7941413256811394
Bile duct sludge, leaks and strictures are frequent complications after liver transplantation, which can contribute to graft dysfunction.	0.6249139171508671
Biliary tract complications usually occur within the first 3 months and require interventional radiological or surgical therapy.	0.5346999148139451
Since liver transplant recipients undergo immunosuppressive therapy, they are at increased risk of developing late post-transplant malignancies, which are best depicted by US, CT or MRI.	0.6974606895455475
However, radiological diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disorder has to be confirmed by liver biopsy.	0.7019247725345675
Conclusion: Cholangiography and Duplex sonography are routinely used in the postoperative evaluation of patients with OLT.	0.7312767120104885
CT, MRI, and angiography are problem-solving tools in equivocal cases.	0.6327683575514177
Recurrence of colorectal carcinomas occurs in about 50 % of the cases with localized neoplasia.	0.7791321947217005
It is understood that the tumor recurrence is due to residual micrometastases not found during surgery or extraregional (peripheral blood or bone marrow).	0.47075853880184815
We developed a procedure to detect non-visible, abdominal metastases using a radiolabeled anti-tumor cell antibody injected before the operation (radioimmunoguided surgery, RIGS).	0.5028058901199742
However, even with the best technique, it is not possible to remove all micrometastasis if a hematogenic dissemination happens.	0.8258651017207637
Based on the knowledge of disturbing humoral immune reaction is mounted against shed tumor associated antigens (TAA), we developed a new method to reduce and correct the B cell response and B cell recruitment due to chronic TAA immun complex presentation on follicular dendritic cells (immune corrective surgery, ICS).	0.5312328332225326
This method is based on a selective lymphadenectomy.	0.769802428801556
The target lymph nodes were those loaded with TAA-immune complex.	0.38983083433764065
The detection method used was the injection of radiolabeled antibody able to recognize the immune complex.	0.45136047263672596
From 20 patients (stage I, II and III) treated with ICS, 17 survived more than 5 years ' showing a statistically significant increase of survival compared to patients treated with standard procedures.	0.7116211476747315
In conclusion, these data show that surgery of colorectal cancer should be selectively extended to specific anatomical regions in order to remove hidden micrometastases, and more importantly, correct postoperative immune processes that could suppress the T cell response against residual tumor cells.	0.6378245697991366
Knowledge of normal and impaired pulmonary gas exchange is essential to the anaesthesiologist.	0.6605548958794564
Analysis of an arterial blood sample allows evaluation of whether or not pulmonary gas exchange is normal.	0.5304809362767477
For this purpose comparison with the oxygenation index or the alveolar-arterial PO2 difference is helpful.	0.5895583475855701
Pathological changes of these variables are mainly caused by ventilation-perfusion (V.A/Q.)	0.5294871981219432
In daily practice, venous admixture or intrapulmonary shunt can be calculated using arterial and mixed-venous blood.	0.5849527506883904
By analysing arterial and expired PCO2, dead-space ventilation can be determined, but extended analyses of V.A/Q.	0.44083008146123454
distribution are not possible in daily practice.	0.590795740555067
However, knowledge of the principles of typical disturbances of pulmonary gas exchange in acute and chronic lung disease allows the use of therapeutic strategies based on the pathophysiological changes.	0.6775523403837799
Background: Infectious endocarditis can lead to embolic arterial retinal occlusions.	0.37805500555897886
The case of a 30 year old man with acatalasemia is presented.	0.5771380617061616
The congenital disorder  is charaterized by a lack or major reduction of catalase, an enzyme that catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water.	0.4361463311338075
The defect is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion.	0.4348966183428476
Occasionally the defect manifests as progressive oral gangrene or Takahara's, disease.	0.2699697066285153
Poor longterm success has been reported for penile vein ligation the last few years.	0.4835311345122225
Therefore, we decided to re-investigate our group of 147 patients who were operated on between 1987 and 1996.	0.6674079748173681
All patients showed a negative response to intracavernous injection therapy at the time of diagnosis and revealed a maintenance flow > 15 ml/min, as well as a pathological venous flow with pharmacocavernosometry or pharmacocavernosography.	0.7234431828060142
These patients underwent ligation of all superficial dorsal veins and resection of the deep dorsal vein of the penis.	0.5644860196819473
An up-to-date record of the success of the operation was kept either by a renewed clinical visit or by a standardized telephone interview or questionnaire.	0.6181457030301583
A total of 126 patients were available here for long-term follow-up.	0.5098104112483125
We divided the findings into three groups: complete spontaneous erection, postoperative response to cavernous auto-injection therapy and no changes in erectile competency postoperatively.	0.47778675162251644
The short-term success rate for these groups after 1-3 months was an outcome of 31 (24.6 %), 25 (19.8 %) and 70 (55.6 %) patients; 86 % of the cases whose results deteriorated after the initial operation success rate had this happen within the first postoperative year (p K 0.001).	0.8757808527434175
Favorable prognostic factors were preoperative erectile dysfunction of K 7 years, a normal CC-EMG and a maintenance flow of K 45 ml/min.	0.5467683416771696
If all three parameters were present, the long-term success rate (spontaneous erection plus response to intracavernous injection) of 30 % of all patients was found to rise to 67 % in this selected group of patients (p K 0.001).	0.8658634068674906
This study reveals that long-term success for unselected patients undergoing penile venous surgery is disappointing; however, careful selection of patients by certain prognostic factors can improve long-term results.	0.5839901296547425
Pyoderma gangraenosum can cause great therapeutic problems.	0.2476950716935031
High dosed corticosteroids are the treatment of choice.	0.4217195690000399
However, recalcitrant pyoderma gangraenosum or side effects from corticosteroid treatment may require therapeutic alternatives.	0.36792425790712235
Pyoderma gangraenosum responds excellently to treatment with cyclosporine A.	0.36607257450656594
Because of side effects and drug interactions, the patients must be selected and carefully and closely monitored.	0.7672600832040855
Six patients with pyoderma gangraenosum, unresponsive to various topical and systemic therapies, were treated with oral cyclosporine A at mean daily doses of approximately 3 mg/kg.	0.5800445672239265
Marked improvement of the skin lesions and complete healing occurred in all patients over a period of 3-6 months.	0.9869387313551846
Only one patient suffered a relapse after discontinuation of the treatment.	0.5974313606487197
No severe irreversible side effects occurred.	0.26858473144659667
The results show that low-dose cyclosporine A treatment can be considered a first-line treatment of pyoderma gangraenosum.	0.8268023477205527
Medical treatment of injured patients by international missions of non-governmental organisations in crisis areas and out-of-area operations by troops, and also national disasters require special trauma management.	0.5023493236667766
Deviations from peacetime surgical guidelines are obligatory because of long-distance medical evacuation, the possibility of gaps in supply and the typical pattern of war injuries.	0.5163054165367242
Massive contamination combined with the high risk of infection is one typical attribute of wounds inflicted during a war or a disaster.	0.652078269837626
In contrast to peacetime surgical guidelines, aggressive wound débridement is often needed.	0.5051867861167633
Timely and prophylactically prescription of a broad-spectrum antibiotic with a long half-life has great importance in the treatment of these wounds.	0.5765131944831487
Suitable antibiotics for these indications are: piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftriazon.	0.29457163684861987
Nevertheless the use of antimicrobial agents will only be effective with early surgical débridement.	0.39206281589686814
Craniofacial development may be potentially implicated after vault corrections in cases of craniosynostosis.	0.32682912663177766
The aim of this prospective study was the investigation of the surgical effect on calvaria growth, correlating the percentiles of a group of patients before and after craniosynostosis correction in relation to the normal percentiles of growth.	0.749765850019182
The patient population consisted of 71 children; the postoperative follow-up time in 57 patients was more than 12 months.	0.6963555884475373
Of the children followed up, 36 were male and 21 female.	0.6549137575895237

Today a large number of operative procedures on retroperitoneal organs can be performed using minimally invasive techniques.	0.6152764417305819
The retroperitoneal space can be reached laparoscopically through the peritoneal cavity or by the direct retroperitoneoscopic approach.	0.5228595672271323
The correct anatomical placement of the first trocar is of particular importance in procedures with the patient in lateral decubitus position in order to avoid injuries.	0.7461331575215356
The overview is worse than in conventional surgery because of the magnifying effect of the laparoscope, which is, furthermore, positioned very close to the operative field.	0.7261551049352207
It is therefore of great importance for the surgeon to use anatomical structures for orientation.	0.7164689009475557

Based upon our increasing knowledge of mechanisms underlying tissue destruction in RA patients, new therapeutic principles have been developed, aimed at blocking proinflammatory cytokines or using antiinflammatory cytokines.	0.517493647218507
Both principles, however, have proven to be very effective.	0.6904038798552293
In addition, the availability of the methodology to transduce cells with genes has initiated first experiments in animal models to test whether gene therapy for arthritis is suitable, followed by a first, very carefully formulated protocol for human RA.	0.5907983000337352
Gene therapy for RA has to still be considered as an experimental form of therapy in a very early stage, not allowing even now any serious treatment offer to RA patients.	0.7505341771102493
Several problems, such as the question of a suitable vector system have not yet been solved.	0.6802609668319486

Nonunion of the ankle malleoli is extremely rare these days.	0.598979168258198
This is probably due to the fact that primary osteosynthesis is performed in ankle fractures instead of the conservative treatment given up to 20 years ago.	0.7022383708369141
Today nonunions of the malleoli are seen, if at all, is infected cases after surgical procedures.	0.6258041077666124
Noninfected, stable and painless nonunions usually do not need any surgical correction.	0.3909532618888225
In painful cases, small fragments, especially of the medial malleolus, should be resected; larger fragments should be stabilized with two 3.5-mm cancellous screws.	0.7906889633562346
Alternatively, the tension banding technique, especially after Weber A fracture, produces high compression in the area of nonunion.	0.589988421885595
In cases of additional bony defects, a local upside down cortical-cancellous bone graft should be performed in addition.	0.7001031294043323
In summary, the therapeutic approach requires exact remodeling, bone-grafting and stabilization.	0.7089298829067207

This study investigated the influence of the patients' educational level on indication for and duration of psychotherapy and the choice of treatment methods (psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy or psychoanalysis).	0.7436116345771452
We considered treatments that were conducted within the framework of the statutory health insurance in Germany.	0.35318624171698815
Data were collected from the therapists' case history (n=274), submitted to the first author as an expert of the statutory health insurance companies.	0.5336400436973862
We found a significant relationship between level of education and indication for psychotherapy.	0.6237222844864881
In our sample 43.5% had graduated from senior high school compared with 25.1% in the average German population.	0.6067652992905537
This relationship is getting more clear if we discriminate between psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy and psychoanalysis.	0.33465347365399783
51.7% of the patients undergoing psychoanalysis had graduated from senior high school and only 13.2% from junior high school compared with 48.7% in the average German population.	0.6464173680583117
Also the duration of psychotherapy depends only on the level of education, not on gender, age or type of statutory health insurance.	0.7408930953153593
These results are discussed carefully and questions for further investigations are deduced.	0.617902523447243
After the initial enthusiasm subsided lasercoagulation of the prostate has been criticized because the extent of tissue destruction cannot be controlled and many patients may be expected to have significant postoperative obstructive as well as irritative voiding symptoms which may last for weeks.	0.6483144438514045
Thanks to new laservaporization techniques these disadvantages have been largely eliminated.	0.2723211221838527
With the Holmium laser a real resection of prostatic tissue is possible allowing the surgeon to see the prostatectomy defect immediately and to assess tissue destruction during the operation ("what you see is what you get").	0.5344911360807785

The classification of acetabular fractures and especially the diagnosis of additional lesions can be misleading, when the personal experience is limited and the decisions are based only on conventional radiographs.	0.6873401442110302
The introduction of Spiral-CT with multiplanar reformations and 3-D views has improved the quality of visualization.	0.5650250352378547
Due to their higher costs, the need of these additional diagnostic tools is frequently questioned.	0.7110649634008477
This paper discusses the relevance of plain radiographs, 2-D-CTs, 3-D-CTs and Femursubtraction-CTs (FsCT) for the classification of acetabular fractures, based on a controlled study.	0.7930102874225986
Methods: Thirty physicians with different levels of experience in acetabular surgery were divided in three groups of 10 each: group I comprised residents without operative experience in acetabular surgery, group II was physicians with 3-10 years of operative experience, and group III was experts in acetabular surgery.	0.71881342738858
A total of 10 complete radiographic cases of high quality providing all levels of preoperative diagnostics (plain radiographs, 2-D-CT, CT with multiplanar reformation, 3-D-CT, Fs-CT) of different acetabular fracture types were prepared.	0.7391969486354765
The task for each candidate was to classify the fracture according to Letournel and to identify all additional injuries within the hip joint (e. g. marginal impaction, head fractures, etc.).	0.5191466988457377
The different diagnostic "levels" could be ordered stepwise according to personal need and no time limit was given.	0.45887406624471405
The case was finished when the candidate presented his final diagnosis.	0.3092317690728754
The use of the different radiographs, the preliminary diagnosis, the changes in diagnosis, and the final decisions were recorded.	0.9350314784899907
These findings were correlated with the different levels of experience and against a "consensus classification" which was generated by thorough discussion, and the use of intraoperative information and postoperative radiographs not accessible to the candidates.	0.7760252739224031
Results: The "correct" fracture classification based on plain radiographs was: group I, 11 %; group II, 32 %; group III, 61 %.	0.704573985242887
Based on 2-D-CT a "correct" diagnosis was reached by 30 % in group I, by 55 % in group II, and by 76 % in group III.	0.9759689417683343
With consideration of the "transient forms" in acetabular fractures based on Letournel and the 3-D-CT used mainly by group I, the rate of "correct" classifications rose to 65 % in group I, 64 % in group II and 83 % in group III.	0.827112376663907
The modifiers were diagnosed "correctly" in group I by 37 %, in group II by 56 %, and in group III by 73 %.	0.8754789002952796
The use of the 3-D-CT and especially the Fs-CT by group I resulted in an improvement in the rate of correct classifications to 61 %, whereas in group II the Fs-Ct was used only exceptionally.	0.8202921480927783
The 2-D-CT was the basis for the diagnosis of the additional lesions in acetabular fractures within all groups resulting in 73 % complete diagnoses in group III.	0.8128364242486616
This study showed the importance of CT for the exact analysis and classification of acetabular fractures.	0.5416822325726787
In particular, the secondary reformations in CT and the 3-D-views dramatically improved the rate of "correct" classifications in the group of surgeons with limited personal experience in acetabular surgery.	0.6654277195357979
This allows the less experienced an acceptable level of "correct" diagnoses, so that the treatment options can be weighed correctly.	0.5984485863479718
Among the "experts" a rate of divergent classifcations of approximately 20 % was observed, especially in "transient" forms of acetabular fractures.	0.7517623321841277

Transcranial Doppler (TCD) may be used to measure cerebral blood flow speed in response to such stimuli.	0.7003461009755848
The aim of this study was to analyze cerebral vasoreactivity in patients with high-grade carotid stenosis and to determine the short- and long-term effects of desobliteration.	0.7914375982766931
A total of 40 patients had bilateral preoperative studies done and 24 were re-evaluated 1 year later.	0.4987524825177238
The preoperative vasomotor capacity using TCD with CO2 was 57% +/- 45.	0.39349233324420624
Hemodynamic reserve did not decrease significantly in the early postoperative period on the operated hemisphere, and 1 year later hemodynamic reserve had increased to to 102% +/- 80%.	0.7125255340940932
One year later patients with unilateral stenosis (n=11) presented with a restitution of reactivity to 65% +/- 46% after initial postoperative ipsilateral decrease from 51% +/- 35% to 48% +/- 38%.	0.5955017947198338
Patients with bilateral stenoses (n=9) demonstrated an initial decrease from 70% +/- 60% to 48% +/- 21% and a significant rise to 115% +/- 77% 1 year later (P=0.02).	0.6465634332725277
Both the significant postoperative increase in the cerebral vasomotor capacity in patients with bilateral carotid stenoses registered in both hemispheres and long-term improvement in patients with unilateral stenosis underline the effectivity of carotid desobliteration in antiembolic prophylaxis and in cerebral blood flow increase, irrespective of the symptomatology.	0.5417140980739079
Chronic constipation can be divided in two large groups: slow-transit constipation, caused by pathological intestinal transit, and obstructive defecation disorder, caused by pelvic and rectal wall abnormalities.	0.5973339331617717
Videodefecography and defecoflowmetry are methods used to study dynamic evacuation of the rectum.	0.4491653863206445
Videodefecography also enables visual estimation of rectal evacuation.	0.34343969779540245
Defecoflowmetry allows analysis of anal and rectal pressures.	0.24429077262876142
Within this prospective study we utilized and compared these methods in 19 patients with slow transit and 30 patients with obstructive disease.	0.7030431043630607
In patients with slow transit, both investigations demonstrated a significantly higher defecation rate than in obstructive defecation disorder (slow transit: defecoflowmetry 65 %, videodefecography 80 %; obstructive defecation disorder: 50 % and 58 %).	0.617684919150306
The evacuation time was pathologically prolonged in both types of constipation, with a range of 43-55 s. Rectoceles are demonstrated in 94 % of cases with slow transit and in 72 % with obstructive defecation disorder.	0.7238507386227344
Also, we often found obstructive components in slow-transit constipation patients.	0.5096640203611742
Normal defecography or defecoflowmetry can rule out obstructive defecation disorder.	0.2311524625002069
We conclude that videodefecography and defecoflowmetry are important items in the complex diagnostic regimen needed in evaluation of chronic constipation.	0.4459870348934346

The chest x-ray showed a mediastinal rounded mass in the dorsal part overlapping the right mediastinal border.	0.5029073094534151
Computer tomography was unable to discriminate the atrial wall from the tumour masses; hence the difference between an (intra-)cardiac tumour (i.e.	0.580599807673163
myxoma) and a tumour of extracardiac (mediastinal) origin could not be established.	0.6990495835785641
Additional magnetic resonance tomography led to the most probable diagnosis of a bronchogenic cyst, which spread ventrally up to the ascending aorta and dorsally to the paravertebral region, thus displacing and shrinking the left pulmonary artery and the left atrium.	0.8048353296931813
Therapy: For certain exclusion of malignancy and because of displacement of other thoracic structures the patient was operated on this mediastinal mass by anterolateral thoracotomy.	0.5546101907434143

Stress fractures are one of the most common overuse injuries seen in athletes, accounting for up to 20 % of all injuries presented to sports medicine clinics.	0.756253621536292
Runners are particularly prone to these injuries, however, it is difficult to predict injury as there is usually a critical interplay between the athlete's biomechanical predisposition, training methods, and other factors such as diet, and muscle strength and flexibility.	0.6645834589136234
This article will discuss the key clinical findings for the majority of stress fractures encountered in a sports medicine practice.	0.5329252456005475
A classification scheme will also be described that will allow the clinician to make appropriate treatment decisions based on the degree of risk for each injury.	0.5344523072618262
Today, enzyme therapy with proteolytic enzymes still only plays a minor role in clinical practice, partially due to the belief that intestinal resorption of macromolecules is impossible.	0.49731032687605103
However, there is scientific evidence of intestinal resorption and a subsequent increase in proteolytic serum activity, and placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials have demonstrated positive effects of enzyme therapy.	0.6725267025542894
The documented effects include the reduction of oedema and resorption of haematoma, resulting in pain reduction and better mobility.	0.4692576773706895
There are indications to use such therapies in the areas of general surgery, traumatology, plastic surgery, and dental surgery.	0.6363888263035634
A further effect is higher tissue concentration of antibiotics in combination with proteolytic enzymes.	0.4652449482210044
In gynaecological treatments, enzymes are administered in breast surgery and to reduce the side effects of obstetrical injuries.	0.5576699159061296
Breast engorgement is a further indication for enzyme therapy.	0.34921051026281413
Further studies concerning enzyme therapy are justified because of the interesting possibilities offered by these substances and a favourable relationship between costs and benefits.	0.4830834512994981
High-frequency ventilation and inhaled nitric oxide represent - among others - two treatment options in hypoxemic respiratory failure of neonates.	0.6216919082177647
We report the case of a term infant with meconium aspiration syndrome, who only responded favorably to inhaled nitric oxide following the initiation of high-frequency ventilation.	0.6068248777785539
At an oxygenation index of 17 we started treatment with nitric oxide in order to reverse right-to-left shunting and improve oxygenation.	0.4727915658871872
How- ever the respiratory situation did not improve, the oxygenation index increased to 25.	0.4932500583186478
After discontinuation of nitric oxide the mode of ventilation was switched to HFV with mean airway pressures of 15 mbar.	0.4171883843592856
Again oxyena-tion was unaffected with an oxygenation index of meanwhile 31.	0.31254147406079874
At that stage of a second trial of inhaled nitric oxide was started at a concentration of 10 ppm while continuing high-frequency ventilation.	0.5450484142430465
Immediately oxygenation improved significantly, the oxygenation index decreased to 9 within several minutes after restarting nitric oxide.	0.4723863088527251
This effect on oxygenation was sustained for the duration of several days during high-frequency ventilation until gradual weaning from iNO could be performed.	0.5755468497792596
Learning microsurgery of the middle ear requires preparations of temporal bones.	0.4697843494795216
Ethical and moral restrictions in obtaining specimens make training and research with temporal bone preparations increasingly more difficult.	0.34861512865413385
Due to the complex structure of the temporal bone with its communicating cavities, the manufacture of facsimiles up to now has been impossible.	0.6801999931939507
Rapid prototyping techniques must be able to produce identical objects from an original one.	0.3303497027847075
By using CT scans of temporal bones from anatomic preparations and patients we have been able to reconstruct 3D pictures on a CAD workstation.	0.4856650966826041
We are now able to incorporate data in a stereolithographic system to create an anatomic facsimile of the temporal bone.	0.4730656580498603
It is possible to produce a considerable number of these facsimiles from the same real object.	0.5816874943677365
With this method we can produce models of human structure for medical teaching, training and research.	0.6019079241089733
Our artificial preparations of temporal bones correspond to both the material characteristics and anatomic details of human structures, allowing various surgical exercises to be carried out.	0.4842055377308096
During the past few years the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, the most frequent of the rheumatic inflammatory systemic diseases has improved a great deal.	0.7942381048014203
The treatment strategy is based on the one hand on the so-called prognostic factors and on the other hand on the extent of the inflammatory activities, especially during the first phase.	0.8201518703012212
Numerous controlled studies and meta-analyses have enabled optimal application of the basic disease-modifying drugs, with regard to efficacy and side effects.	0.6225271725754168
During the first stage of these disease, the immunobiological substances against pro-inflammatory cells are employed.	0.6327295326187631
Improved knowledge of physiotherapeutic treatment, correct diet and careful observation of the patient's progress with the aid of questionnaires enable optimal care with regard to life quality.	0.590033392496721
Intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEPi) occurring during mechanical ventilation depends on expiratory time constants, expiratory volume and expiration time as well as on external flow resistance (tubes, valves, etc.).	0.4681095751130749
It is not routinely determined in mechanically ventilated patients, but it is necessary to optimize respirator settings.	0.8171006446545019
The aim of the present study was the validation of an automated PEEPi determination method implemented in the respirator EVITA (Drägerwerke, Lübeck) in mechanically ventilated patients with acute lung failure.	0.719533490057919
The method was validated in ten sedated, myorelaxed patients with respiratory insufficiency of different etiologies (five with restrictive, and five with obstructive pulmonary disease).	0.6396644118389067
PEEPi was determined using the volume constant ventilatory mode at ZEEP or at an external PEEP of 5 as well as 10 cm H2O.	0.4564643420926012
PEEPi was first determined with the automated method implemented in the EVITA (five measurements at each end-expiratory pressure level; PEEPEvita).	0.5115891129207683
Steady-state was attained between each measurement.	0.28322092876392513
These values were compared to the results obtained with end-expiratory occlusion (external, computer-controlled valve in the inspiratory limb of the circuit) at the respective pressure levels (PEEPEEO).	0.7109817979873769
The average of five measurements at each PEEP level with each method was defined as PEEPi for the particular ventilatory situation.	0.5038501167162142
Gas flow was measured at the proximal end of the endotracheal tube with a heated pneumotachometer (Fleisch no.	0.42736231319891294
2, Fleisch, Lausanne, Switzerland) and a differential pressure transducer.	0.6876346543074069
Tracheal pressure was determined in the same position with a further differential pressure transducer (Dr. Fenyves & Gut, Basel, Switzerland).	0.5180262260800017
After A/D conversion, data were sampled with a frequency of 20 Hz and processed on an IBM compatible PC.	0.4761863216118522
Software for data collection and processing as well as for control of the occlusion valve was self-programmed.	0.5922531178616881
For the statistical analysis we used the Mann-Whitney U-test or Wilcoxon signed-ranks test; a P value less than 0.05 was considered significant.	0.5404772337071049
At the given respiratory setting and without PEEP patients with obstructive lung disease had a higher PEEPi (median: 6.4 cm H2O; range: 5.0 - 9.6 cm H2O) than those with restrictive pulmonary disease (median: 2.3 cm H2O; range: 0.8 - 3.0 cm H2O) (P<0.05).	0.8746380956298434
Increasing external PEEP to 5 or 10 cm H2O significantly decreased the pressure difference between PEEPi and external PEEP (P<0.05), but was unable to eliminate it completely.	0.5526662856950756
There was no statistically significant difference between PEEPEEO and PEEPEvita (P=0.43; Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests).	0.5189726232595434
Regression analysis showed a highly significant correlation between PEEPEEO and PEEPEvita values (r=0.985, P<0.001; y=1.03x-0.18).	0.5090551801029489
PEEPi occurs during ventilation in patients with obstructive and restrictive lung disease.	0.4739478687553917
The difference between external end-expiratory pressure and PEEPi decreases with increasing external PEEP.	0.484467230214249
However, PEEPi may increase with increasing external PEEP in some instances.	0.4736890006753129
The reason for this may be that the PEEPi determined at the proximal end of the endotracheal tube represents only a mean value of different PEEPi values of various lung regions.	0.5553586703323026
Increasing external PEEP only partially alters this mean value due to an effect on PEEPi values lower than external PEEP.	0.4592680059876245
The PEEPi values measured by the EVITA respirator compared with classical end-expiratory occlusion with an external valve were nearly identical.	0.5156951594822226
Unfortunately, PEEPi measurement of the EVITA can only	0.5139769480191607
We report on the case of a 70-year-old caucasian woman with a large linear sebaceous naevus with multifocal intralesional basaliomas and a lipodermoid of the left eye.	0.6697342160952016
This rare finding has been preserved because of the special history of the patient.	0.6077272623129474
The naevus spread on the left side from parietal to retroauricular, nuchal and sternal.	0.41969926822233
Because of the patient's cardio-pulmonary insufficiency we excised the basaliomas under local anaesthesia.	0.5764694028687342
We also made a partial stripped excision of the left-sided parietal parts of the naevus.	0.7066270647800582
We describe an HLA-B27 positive patient in whom posttraumatic pyogenic sacroilitis led to complete unilateral sacroiliac joint ankylosis in the absence of any signs indicative of HLA-B27 associated spondyloarthropathy.	0.4683269153521385
Ondansetron, a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, has recently been shown, in a dose of 8 mg, to be superior to 1.25 mg droperidol in preventing postoperative vomiting.	0.8608832045953193
There are indications that a dose of 4 mg of ondansetron may be just as effective in reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting as a dose of 8 mg [16].	0.6119419550879713
The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and the adverse effects of 4 mg ondansetron in the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting compared to droperidol in patients undergoing surgery with inhalation anaesthesia supplemented with alfentanil.	0.6215512545092594
Following institutional approval, 40 ASA physical status I and II women scheduled for minor gynaecological surgery gave informed consent to participate in this randomized, double-blind comparative study.	0.4901113822847248
Five minutes before induction of general anaesthesia, 20 patients received a single intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg of ondansetron and the remaining 20 received 1.25 mg droperidol IV.	0.6392141211440562
Anaesthesia was induced with 2.1 - 4 mg/kg of thiopental and 0.1 mg of alfentanil IV and maintained with 65% nitrous oxide and 1.5% - 3% enflurane in oxygen.	0.9478620973034877
On pain stimuli another 0.2 - 0.4 mg of alfentanil was given.	0.9035755241813135
Total effective antiemetic response was defined as the absence of nausea and vomiting for 24 h postoperatively.	0.5409362802183685
The incidence of nausea, vomiting and the number of patients showing total antiemetic response as well as the incidence of adverse effects were compared with the chi2 test and P<0.05 was considered significant.	0.6434733006955974
Patients were similar with respect to age, height, body weight and total anaesthetic agents received.	0.5192277835653988
Duration of anaesthesia and the time until awakening was not significantly different among groups.	0.8168970579259671
Postoperatively 7 out of 20 patients given 4 mg of ondansetron and 3 out of 20 patients with droperidol vomited (n.s.).	0.682054225624206
The incidence of nausea was 11 out of 20 in the ondansetron group, and 4 out of 20 in the droperidol group (P<0.05).	0.6073658458755362
Sixteen patients in the droperidol group and 8 patients in the ondansetron group showed a total effective antiemetic response (P<0.05).	0.5687487070576985
Postoperative sedation and well-being scores did not differ significantly among groups.	0.6446968962437792
Our results show that for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting 4 mg of ondansetron was inferior to 1.25 mg of droperidol.	0.5858891115550295
The drugs were given intravenously prior to general anaesthesia for minor gynaecological surgery with nitrous oxide and enflurane in oxygen supplemented with small boluses of alfentanil.	0.4608497148211855

Since 1993, 30 patients with acute distal intraarticular radius fractures have been treated under arthroscopic assistance.	0.5811724770446125
According to the AO classification there were 3 B- and 27 C-fractures, most of them Frykman VIII fractures.	0.7121863657100762
Of 30 fractures 23 showed additional lesions which could only be diagnosed under arthroscopic view.	0.4750168584384314
In particular, 12 partial or complete tears of the intracarpal ligaments were found.	0.517286996412188
Of 25 fractures 23 which were treated at least 12 months previously could be followed up radiologically and clinically.	0.5898647844891463
X-rays included postero anterior and lateral views to evaluate the radial angles and the radial length and stress tests to check for instability, especially of the scapholunate ligaments.	0.5999067354441182
Clinical examination included range of motion and objective grip strength measured with a Jamar (Cedaron) tester.	0.4289732470579011
Each test was performed on both wrists for comparison.	0.5666173897705513
Subjective data included pain and function for daily activities.	0.2938968137259612
Data were evaluated by the Jakim and the Cooney scoring system and the demerit point system by Gartland and Werley as modified by Sarmiento et al.	0.3724936150812287
About 70% of our patients showed an excellent or good result; about 15% had a poor result.	0.9442813715123632
However, we must mention that we were not able to reduce one C3-fracture under arthroscopic view and had to switch to a semi-open procedure with additional external fixateurs.	0.593585719556754
Arthroscopically assisted treatment of distal intraarticular fractures is not only useful to detect and manage additional carpal lesions, but seems to give good midterm results as well.	0.6186410720488532
Antitachycardia pacing techniques (ATP) have proved useful for termination of ventricular tachycardia (VT).	0.4987898971366116
However, little is known about the efficacy and safety off ATP during long-term follow-up in a larger study population.	0.6183561834606937
We analyzed the data of 80 ICD patients (pts) with spontaneous monormorphic VT, mean age 59  +/-  12 years, the mean follow-up was 26  +/-  17 months.	0.8754604057434463
50 pts (62.5%) had coronary artery disease, 18 (22.5%) dilative cardiomyopathy (DCM), the remaining 12 pts (15%) had no or other cardiac diseases.	0.7933463200553486
2926 episodes of ventricular tachycardia (cycle length 349  +/-  51 ms, 240-520 ms) occurred in 64/80 pts (80%), overall efficacy of ATP was 89.9%, acceleration occurred in 4.1% of VTs.	0.5603352489717293
Success of ATP did not correlate with positive ATP testing on induced arrhythmias, LVEF, NYHA class or aneurysm.	0.3483075647755648
Neither underlying heart disease nor antiarrhythmic medication had an impact on the ATP success rate.	0.38744557059934404
ATP efficacy was linked significantly to short VT cycle length (VTCL, 240-300 ms, p < 0.01) and long coupling intervals (91-97%), p < 0.01).	0.503621960632556
Acceleration occurred in 32% of pts and in 4.1% of VT episodes; it was also dependent on short VT cycle length (< 300 ms vs > 300 ms, p < 0.04) and short coupling intervals (< 81% vs >= 81%, p <= 0.01).	0.8645925932721022

Hydromorphone is a µ receptor agonist opioid.	0.25263195223220136
According to WHO recommendations, hydromorphone is to be classified in step III of pain therapy.	0.5879454056323613
An oral formulation with a prolonged duration of action of 12 hours has been evaluated only recently.	0.5348914595261545
The controlled release capsule is especially suited for the regular twice a day administration in cases of severe and persistent pain.	0.6191239474767464
The oral formulation of hydromorphone increases the number of opioid analgesics available for pain therapy in step III.	0.480972964003984
Hydromorphone is recommended when morphine fails to produce sufficient pain relief (despite increase of doses) or causes intolerable side effects (despite treatment of symptoms).	0.5126933817284104
In principle, no differences in efficacy of morphine and hydromorphone are to be expected.	0.6687227319378537
However, clinical experience shows that changing one opioid analgesic to another one can improve the treatment of patients so that hydromorphone may replace another opioid analgesic to which a patient fails to respond well or develops side effects.	0.5790486656512231
The dose of hydromorphone equivalent to 2 times 30 mg controlled release morphine is about 2 times 4 mg.	0.46535222157645995
The values for the absorption, bioavailability and maximum plasma concentration after the administration of controlled release hydromorphone every 12 hours -of three times the dose- are equivalent to those of an immediate release tablet given every 4 hours.	0.5963005054179026
In several open label and controlled studies, hydromorphone proved to be of good efficacy in the treatment of acute and persistent pain, especially in patients with severe cancer pain.	0.8030003937057169
With regard to the incidence of side effects, no significant differences between morphine and hydromorphone could be established.	0.7704055815855165
In general, the side effects of hydromorphone are typical for opioid analgesics.	0.6523950400820696
In 63 patients, 82 elevations of the maxillary sinus were performed.	0.49737699336948593
As augmentation, materials autografts from the iliac crest (combined with alveolar ridge augmentations in 16 sinus lifts) were transplanted in 39 cases and osteoinductive, allogeneic bone powder (AAA bone (autolyzed, antigen-extracted, allogeneic bone): n = 8, DFDBA (demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft) and/or GraftonTM (demineralized bone matrix gel): n = 35) were used in 43 cases.	0.5526227355468317
Some 4-6 months after implantation, osteoinductive, allogeneic (demineralized) bone implants showed radio-opaque areas as an equivalent of bone formation.	0.6616549097019312
Histological examinations revealed that osteoinductive implants were completely transformed into patients' own bone tissue.	0.3794979472779974
The average augmentation height after autograft transplantations was 14 ( +/-  3) mm in comparison with 9 ( +/-  3) mm after allograft implantations.	0.7095631757452072
Histologically as well as radiologically no differences of the bone quality could be determined between the two augmentation materials.	0.7043011207490102
Endoscopic controls showed, in both groups, nonirritated mucous membranes.	0.5888645780253123
On an average 2 endosseous implants (Bone LockR or ITIR-screw implants) were inserted into the augmentated maxillary sinus floors in both groups.	0.5595590042396413
No osseointegration was achieved in 4 out of 67 dental implants when bone autografts were used and in 2 out of 74 dental implants of the allogeneic bone group.	0.535151902037417
Patients with bone autografts suffered from postoperative complaints on an average of 19 ( +/-  9) days (without consideration of 2 patients with postoperative complaints persisting for more than 90 days).	0.754751226165064
The average postoperative complaints of recipients of allogeneic bone implants continued for 3 ( +/-  5) days.	0.7233150041539486
The 13 patients who underwent an ambulant sinus lift procedure with allogeneic bone powder were already symptom-free several hours after the operation.	0.6193316799596341
Under critical consideration of all investigated parameters, osteoinductive bone implants are preferable to iliac bone autografts for maxillary sinus augmentations in those cases in which no additional alveolar ridge augmentation is required.	0.46147621459057303

Histological examination after nephrectomy, however, revealed a plasmacytoma.	0.47686219423162424
Based on this case, we discuss how one should proceed in this disease.	0.7298517798255402
Primary renal plasmacytoma can be tentatively diagnosed preoperatively only in the presence of paraproteinemia or Bence-Jones proteinuria, as it cannot be distinguished from other renal tumors by imaging procedures.	0.5695579654828766
Postoperatively, further staging procedures must rule out bone involvement (solitary myeloma or multiple myeloma).	0.4420426241250039
Nephrectomy is required in patients with plasmacytoma only if renal complications occur.	0.4145449365924142
Dissection of the ascending aorta (type A) following later after aortic valve replacement has been described with increasing frequency.	0.7680749169138029

Between December 1986 and November 1995, 222 patients with 225 acetabular fractures were treated operatively by three surgeons in the Department of Traumatology and Emergency Surgery of the University Hospitals of the Catholic University of Leuven.	0.590255102833954
Indications for surgery were unstable fracture, displaced fracture through the acetabular dome and fracture with intra-acetabular fracture fragments.	0.4783934098121654
There were 37.3% A-fractures, 49.7% B-fractures, and 13% C fractures according to the AO Classification.	0.7233882886171265
In 16.4% of fractures there were primary neurological deficits.	0.5815981059784078
Patients were treated operatively after an average of 5.0 days.	1.104880900461129
The Kocher-Langenbeck approach was used in 56.9% of cases, the ilio-inguinal approach in 27.1% and the extended iliofemoral approach in 4%.	0.7372242643462971
In 7.1% of patients, a primary total hip endoprosthesis was implanted.	0.8660119533866917
There was no intra- oder perioperative mortality.	0.5712261144932881
The average hospital stay was 26.1 days.	0.6782385707692269
In 7.1% of patients, we noted secondary neurological problems.	0.8282463182884787
Deep infections were present in 1.3%.	0.6502121733489766
In 11.1% of patients a second operative procedure was necessary.	0.8693679573353886
We were able to review 175 patients after an average of 2 years.	0.52784359710709
Signs of arthrosis and periarticular ossification were noted on the x-rays: walking distance, hip mobility and pain intensity were asked about and recorded after the clinical examination.	0.6157374333071369
In 76% of patients an excellent or good result on the Merle-d'Aubigne scale was obtained.	0.6737659990696858
T-fractures and posterior wall fractures were followed by the worst results.	0.5396946844950776
During this 9-year period, changes have been made to the preoperative radiological examination carried out, the choice of operative approach and our policy on prevention of thrombosis prophylaxis and postoperative ossification.	0.7243753311119566
After thorough preoperative diagnosis and with a meticulous operative technique, it is possible to stabilise the vast majority of acetabular fractures through the three classical approaches.	0.5936196444642429
Because the fractures are relatively rare, their diagnosis complex and their surgical treatment difficult, specific training is essential for every acetabular surgeon.	0.6453903287738335
Diagnostic pitfalls exist when benign salivary gland diseases are mistakenly classified as malignant, with consequences for treatment and prognosis.	0.5119012342377659
Examples are necrotizing sialometaplasia, metaplastic Warthin tumour and sclerosing polycystic sialadenopathy.	0.25910738794264343
The proper diagnosis is of eminent importance to distinguish cases of primary tumours that have developed in salivary glands or their lymph nodes from cases of extraglandular tumours with metastases in these glands or their nodes.	0.5273817324083665
In these cases clinical data and additional immunocytochemical methods are necessary to clarify the exact diagnosis, especially when the primary salivary gland tumours have a structure largely identical to the metastases (e.g.	0.6901655076431129
Nasopharyngeal or cervical chordomas can be mistaken for pleomorphic adenoma or mucinous adenocarcinoma.	0.2843088667807528
The initial stage of malignant MALT lymphomas in association with Sjögren's syndrome demands identification of clonal rearrangement for therapeutic implication.	0.35404016357880336

A 59-year-old male patient was transnasally operated on because of a pituitary adenoma with hypopituitarism.	0.5254957539862032
A second operation and X-ray therapy followed a half year later due to recurrent tumor.	0.5238848240776778
Both neoplasmas were classified as sparsely granulated prolactin cell adenomas.	0.2680643167292647
Immunohistochemical studies revealed strong immunoreactivity for prolactin and FSH in the tumor cells of both the pituitary adenoma and the recurrent tumor.	0.6507238722157921
Two years later the prolactin plasma levels were extremely elevated.	0.4188059801872866
A tumor in the liver was identified.	0.6315352793579436
Biopsy revealed a solid endocrine tumor containing prolactin by immunohistology.	0.2828730723826185
Due to structural and immunohistological similarities this tumor could be identified as a metastasis of the pituitary tumor.	0.5994862390127259
After 5 months of therapy the patient died from thrombembolism.	0.757419069994608
Post-mortem studies confirmed the diagnosis of a metastasizing prolactin-secreting pituitary carcinoma.	0.5417957603127258
Only six similar cases have been reported in the literature.	0.4923994228208097
Our case report confirms the experience with 35 definite pituitary carcinomas reparted in the current literature: malignant pituitary tumors develop after pituitary surgery and can be identified not from the pituitary tumor, but only from its metastases.	0.6722144719416482
Paraneoplastic markers in tumor patients may occur at various stages of the disease.	0.5225798885898806
While some disorders almost invariably herald an underlying malignancy (obligative marker), most only occasionally do so (facultative marker).	0.429337156968993
The association of bullous pemphigoid with malignancy is controversial.	0.41377997762305246
There are only a few reports of bullous pemphigoid associated with a renal cell carcinoma.	0.6950371974932522
We diagnosed a renal cell carcinoma in a 74 year old female patient, admitted to the hospital because of bullous pemphigoid.	0.614873855277786
Multiple metastases were found in her lymph nodes, liver, lung and skeleton.	0.6585736383617758
The patient died eleven weeks after the first symptoms of bullous pemphigoid appeared.	0.8490993809324877
Acute compartment syndrome of the thigh has been infrequently reported in the literature.	0.4405414087439054
Closed femoral fractures and blunt soft tissue trauma are the main causes of this injury.	0.6206187953823862
The multiple injured patient in this case report developed a compartment syndrome of the thigh after intramedullary nailing of a comminuted fracture of the femur.	0.6417541108408998
Fasciotomy was performed two days after surgery because of extense swelling of the thigh in the ventilated and sedated patient.	0.5087635297007923
Sciatic and femoral nerve palsy was recognized after extubation of the patient nine days after the injury.	0.613390801655795
During the following weeks the paresis of the femoral nerve recovered but neither motor nor sensory function of the sciatic nerve could be demonstrated.	0.6104149968413382
Therefore an operative revision of the sciatic nerve was performed eighteen weeks after trauma.	0.3705141401434858
No direct nerve injury could be detected but there were adhesions around the nerve as a sign of compression neuropathy caused by the compartment syndrome.	0.5477987395249685
The tibial component of the sciatic nerve showed a complete recovery within the next months but there was a persisting peroneal nerve palsy.	0.6408707044043553
Conclusion: Early clinical symptoms of a compartment syndrome like pain, paresthesia and paresis can not be ascertained in a ventilated and sedated patient.	0.48137608215473665
Tense swelling of the muscles is often the only detectable sign.	0.4875192341785746
Frequent measurements of compartment pressure should be done in these patients.	0.5486862793745892
We suggest early decompressive fasciotomy because the morbidity caused by fasciotomy in a borderline compartment syndrome is far outweighed by the morbidity that accompanies an undiagnosed untreated compartment syndrome with possible nerve palsy.	0.4075958092506497
Aim: The long-term effect of DNase with cystic fibrosis was examined.	0.5071617820890469
Teeth are most important for the identification of unknown cadavers.	0.4524946252933434
The police publish difficult cases of unidentified bodies in dental print media.	0.3021074359572562
Using their records such as x-rays or documented dental work dentists can often recognize an unknown person and thus contribute to the identification.	0.4871106638538182
To evaluate the efficency of this procedure 177 cases published between 1975 and 1995 were examined.	0.5085344591277984
Only 3% of the examined cases could be identified due to a reaction to publishing in the dental print media.	0.6696902507040909
To improve the presentation of identification cases in the dental print media 500 dentists were asked to take part in a survey.	0.571031675481664
According to these results a new concept of presentation sould be developed to improve the efficency of this odontoforensic method.	0.5749949330414988
New technological possibilities such as digital x-raying or online data transfer could open new ways for forensic identification.	0.27334688301764715
In a fatality after oral intake of a large amount of an insecticide spray consisting of propoxur, tetramethrine and the solvents isopropanol and benzyl alcohol, a coagulation nectrotic fixation of the oesophagus and stomach were the main morphological findings.	0.5009709272435446
The concentrations determined by HPLC and GC/MS in femoral blood, liver, kidney, vitreous humor and liquor were in the comatose lethal range for propoxur (< 0.3-18 µg/g), whereas tetrametrin (up to 0.1 µg/g) was almost completely decomposed.	0.646794122849045
The propoxur decomposition product o-isopropoxyphenol (2.8-56 µg/g), benzyl alcohol (18-58 µg/g) and its oxydation product benzoic acid (85-140 µg/g), isopropanol (0.45-1.1 mg/g) and acetone (0.01-0.03 mg/g) were also found.	0.7465608078741521
On the other hand, the concentrations in heart blood and lung tissue were up to 30 times higher.	0.5260440762230945
As a reason for these immense concentration differences an agonale aspiration of the highly concentrated liquid stomach content after vomiting immediately before death is discussed.	0.39134650086280376
The extent of the metabolization of propoxur to o-isopropoxyphenol and of benzyl alcohol to benzoic acid, which is assumed to proceed mainly postmortem, was quite different in the materials investigated and was almost complete in the liver.	0.6004505837942316
The intoxication by the acetylcholine esterase inhibitor propoxur in combination with the neurotoxic effect of tetramethrine was determined as the cause of death.	0.4636599326216275
Background: Despite the fact that deep lamellar keratoplasty (DLKP) is less invasive than to penetrating keratoplasty (PKP), this procedure is rarely performed.	0.6842295028820107
We therefore investigated whether or not the DLKP technique we employed can achieve stable improvement of visual acuity.	0.4109663583100698
Palmoplantar keratodermia (PPK) varians and PPK punctata are considered different entities within the group of hereditary palmoplantar keratodermas.	0.3590086658434108
Keratosis punctata of the palmar creases constitutes a localized form of keratodermia palmoplantaris punctata.	0.33878070569320223
We describe a 31-year-old man exhibiting both nummular and papular keratoses on the soles, as well as small punctate keratoses confined to the palmar creases.	0.5355259970903085
In view of the co-occurrence of these two types of PPK, the question arises whether keratosis palmoplantaris of the varians and the punctate type represent distinct entities or represent variable manifestations of the same gene defect.	0.6062934137104966
The author gives a synoptic view on the paths and routes of emigration the jewish and/or political reasons persecuted psychoanalysts had to take in order to escape national socialist Germany.	0.38631606923589096
With reference to current studies on emigration, which for Germany differentiates three distinctive phases of emigration between 1933 and 1938, the immigration policy especially of the United States and Great Britain and its impact on the concrete circumstances and modalities for the emigration of the particular professional group of psychoanalysts is described and discussed.	0.5431388410289562
In this context, the major importance of the solidarity and help the refugees were granted by the international psychoanalytic community and performed in spite of partially major theoretical differences and institutional rivalries is emphasized.	0.5393740111354305
Acute suppurative thyroiditis is very rare in childhood.	0.4335938188153319
We describe the clinical signs and the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures of thyroid abscesses in children, and add 2 own cases of this rare disease.	0.8410308158693799
In the first case, diagnosis of piriform sinus fistula was made finally after repeated drainage for recurrent abscesses of the left thyroid.	0.777969950288184
Operative excision of the fistula was performed and the child is doing well since then.	0.6742214191734585
In the second case, a left sided thyroid abscess was treated by incision and drainage only.	0.7160879411325094
Seven years later, no recurrent abscess occurred in this child.	0.5695485028982751
In conclusion, especially in left sided and recurrent thyroid abscesses the patients should be examined for a piriform sinus fistula as a route of infection.	0.5512627792968028
If present, complete removal of the fistula is essential for permanent cure.	0.7320309877857092
The importance of spiral-CT is clinically accepted for diagnosing spreading disease and for making a decision about the therapy strategy for head and neck tumors.	0.3581899904451724
Its importance for follow-up after radiotherapy was examined in 26 patients with irradiated laryngeal tumors.	0.3837829580115184
Using spiral-CT multiple signs of alterations (n=98) can be diagnosed, which are not only important for tumour relapse, but also for assessment.	0.6754717326396523
Spiral-CT offers the possibility of achieviny various additional information about the larynx that cannot be obtained with laryngoscopy.	0.4047550707548655
In follow-up examinations after radiation, laryngoscopy and spiral-CT are recommended as an integrated neck examination using the breath-holding technique (separately reconstructed) and also as functional spiral-CT of the vocal cords in "I"-phonation.	0.4601500446277371
Simpson in Scotland was the first to describe the administration of ether for analgesia in painful deliveries.	0.5881952240869899
Only a few days later E.C.J.	0.709006984686559
von Siebold (*1801 in Würzburg - \dagger1861 in Göttingen) performed the first systematic study on ether in obstetrics.	0.6240414512260808
Following a preceding evaluation of the action of ether on non-pregnant woman and on pregnant women not in active labour, he administered ether for analgesia during the second stage of labour in eight parturients.	0.5454549063487355
The first administration was on February 25th 1847.	0.25422747060964734
While he was satisfied with the good analgesia without sequelae of the new-born, he was discouraged by the termination of uterine contractions observed in all his patients.	0.5907913187437741
He concluded that ether was not a useful substance for analgesia during vaginal delivery, since it disturbed the natural course of labour.	0.5245124359100721
On the other hand, von Siebold was very pleased with the administration of ether for operative obstetric procedures such as forceps deliveries or placental retention.	0.39500896986917217
Background: Mode switching aims to maintain a ventricular rhythm that matches metabolic needs during both sinus rhythm and atrial tachyarrhythmias.	0.5018112553009358
This allows patients with atrial arrhythmias to benefit from AV synchronous pacing modes.Aim and method: Beat-to-beat mode switching in Diamond and Clarity pacemakers is designed to maintain a relatively stable ventricular rhythm, ensuring consistent ventricular filling patterns.	0.4803235124324374
Atrial tachyarrhythmia detection is based on a continuous analysis of the atrial rhythm.	0.741290097621344
A too rapid increase of the atrial rate with a beat-to-beat acceleration > 15 bpm is considered to be an atrial tachyarrhythmia.	0.7346565151235658
Mode switching occurs on detection of the first premature atrial event: atrial tracking is stopped and the ventricular rate is determined by the rate indicated by the dual sensor (QT interval and activity).	0.563893420096601
Atrial pacing restores AV synchrony immediately after cessation of the atrial tachyarrhythmia, effectively avoiding retrograde conduction.	0.44794014586101016
Dedicated diagnostic functions allow one to monitor the incidence of atrial tachyarrhythmias and to study atrial and ventricular events just prior to its onset.	0.5572562076954771
Both the mode switching and rate responsive function are fully automatic, rendering follow-up procedures easy and less time-consuming.	0.5304495045198512
Conclusion: Reliable detection of all atrial events is essential to guarantee appropriate mode switching.	0.49090484505438936
Therefore, the pacemaker stores the distribution of the amplitude of all atrial events, both during sinus rhythm and atrial tachyarrhythmias, which facilitates the appropriate programming of the atrial sensitivity.	0.7857168210155344
Introduction: Mediastinal diseases are mostly diagnosed by CT and MRI.	0.5051270759443347
The applicability of ultrasound is limited by the surrounding air- and bone-containing thorax, which permits only restricted echo windows.	0.6970248079830271
Transesophageal endoscopic ultrasonography circumvents this problem and ensures visualization of parts of the mediastinum.	0.4108222881094814
Blood glucose alterations prior to cerebral ischaemia are associated with poor neurologic outcome, possibly due to extensive lactic acidosis or energy failure.	0.5187879875987255
Cerebral effects of hyper- or hypoglycaemia during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are less well known.	0.5736753315808512
In addition, little information is available concerning cardiac effects of blood glucose alterations.	0.5211045782036469
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of pre-cardiac-arrest hypo- or hyperglycaemia compared to normoglycaemia upon haemodynamics, cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolism (CMRO2), and regional cardiac blood flow during CPR subsequent to 3 min of cardiac and respiratory arrest and after restoration of spontaneous circulation.	0.6108308905951891
After approval by the State Animal Investigation Committee, 29 mechanically ventilated, anaesthetised pigs were instrumented for haemodynamic monitoring and blood flow determination by the radiolabeled microsphere technique.	0.44723407085225897
The animals were randomly assigned to one of three groups: in group I (n=9) blood glucose was not manipulated; in group II (n=10) blood glucose was increased by slow infusion of 40% glucose to 319 +/- 13 mg/dl; in group III (n=10) blood glucose was lowered by careful titration with insulin to 34 +/- 2 mg/dl.	0.7335348992774
After 3 min of untreated ventricular fibrillation and respiratory arrest, CPR (chest compressor/ventilator (Thumper) and epinephrine infusion) was commenced and continued for 8 min.	0.6044488764124776
Thereafter, defibrillation was attempted, and if successful, the animals were observed for another 240 min.	0.6829633858568581
Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), CBF, CMRO2, coronary perfusion pressure (CorPP), and regional cardiac blood flow were determined at control, after 3 min of CPR, and at 10, 30, and 240 min post-CPR.	0.7198002528230385
In group I, 4/9 animals (44%) could be successfully resuscitated; in group II 4/10 (40%); and in group III 0/10 (0%).	0.8583573490650145
Prior to cardiac arrest, mean arterial pressure, CPP, and CorPP in group III were significantly lower compared to groups I and II.	0.7386649090491965
In group I, CPP during CPR was 26 +/- 6 mmHg; CBF 31 +/- 9 ml/min/100 g CMRO2 3.8 +/- 1.2 ml/min/100 g; CorPP 18 +/- 5 mmHg; and left ventricular (LV) flow 35 +/- 15 ml/min/100 g. In group II: CPP=21 +/- 5; CBF 21 +/- 7; CMRO2 1.8 +/- 0.8; CorPP 16 +/- 6; and LV flow 22 +/- 9; and in group III: CPP 15 +/- 3; CBF 11 +/- 8; CMRO2 1.5 +/- 1.1; CorPP 4 +/- 2; and LV flow 19 +/- 10.	0.7555672509393963
During the 240-min post-resuscitation period, there were no differences in CBF, CMRO2, or LV flow between groups I and II.	0.6511652855678317
Hypoglycaemia prior to cardiac arrest appears to be predictive for a poor cardiac outcome, whereas hyperglycaemia does not impair resuscitability compared to normoglycaemia.	0.5728230810402617
In addition, hyperglycaemia did not affect LV flow, CBF, or CMRO2.	0.49126659483709545
However, it has to be kept in mind that haemodynamics and organ blood flow do not permit conclusions with respect to functional neurologic recovery or histopathologic damage to the brain, which is very likely to be associated with hyperglycaemia.	0.7184783585512632
Abstract  We present an algorithm for the rational diagnosis of glutaric aciduria type I (GA1).	0.5129688432447012
Normal urinary organic acids in patients with non-specific clinical features and normal results of brain imaging render the diagnosis highly unlikely, and no further investigations are required.	0.6673091181117304
In other patients, the diagnostic strategy depends on the individual clinical, neuroradiological and biochemical findings.	0.7336396149804277
GCDH enzyme analysis should be reserved for patients in whom GA1 is very likely.	0.47079292616482843

Malignant lymphomas, originating from peripheral T or NK cells, are rare tumours in Europe and account for less than 10% of all malignant lymphomas.	0.7638924391823126
In this review, the salient features of the more frequently occurring entities derived from T or NK cells will be presented.	0.6048344811589903
Nasal NK/T cell lymphoma is mainly found in the nose and paranasal sinuses and often, but not always, display an angiocentric growth pattern leading to coagulation necrosis.	0.6189281643720775
The tumor cells consistently express CD56, CD2 and the EBER molecules encoded by the Epstein-Barr virus.	0.38610407310598865
Clonal T cell receptor gene rearrangements are often absent indicating, in the majority of cases, a derivation of these tumors from NK cells.	0.6383807837489633
Enteropathy-type intestinal T-cell lymphomas often arise in patients with celiac disease and have a dismal prognosis.	0.565132384795317
The tumour cells express T cell antigens, CD103 and cytotoxic molecules, but are negative for CD4.	0.5932157899403308
Approximately 20% of the cases display CD56 mostly in combination with CD8.	0.6631250036445518
Recently, an early purely intraepithelial form of this tumour was identified.	0.7266214474901875
Histologically these cases resemble celiac disease, however the intraepithelial lymphocytes often exhibit an abnormal immunophenotype with absent CD8 and T-cell-receptor protein expression, and, they are clonal by molecular analysis.	0.6654521862035316
Clinically, the patients suffer from refractory sprue or ulcerative jejunitis.	0.6832991400482515
The prognosis is bad with the patients often dying from malnutrition or an invasive tumour-forming T-cell lymphoma.	0.643156410612378
Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma is defined by characteristic morphological findings (atypical lymphoid cells in part with pale cytoplasm, arborizing high endothelial venules and large FDC-meshworks) as well as clinical features (systemic symptoms, signs of a dysregulated immune response).	0.5429836389812239
Peripheral T-cell lymphomas, that do not fit into a distinct entity, are classified in the REAL and the new WHO classifications as peripheral T-cell lymphomas unspecified.	0.7319102863601042
These display a broad morphological spectrum (including the T-cell lymphomas of different cell sizes, Lennert's lymphoma and T-zone lymphoma of the Kiel-classification) and in general are clinically aggressive.	0.7116959174857476
Causes and courses of the diseases are subjected to a change of an increasing life expectancy on the one hand and technically highly developed medicine on the other hand.	0.5919675765536244
Since a growing number of elderly people is denying intensive medical interventions which serve the purpose of keeping them alive despite severe diseases, the problem of euthanasia imposes direct questions.	0.5303116733739852
A central role is played by the active-passive difference and its moralistic legitimacy.	0.45241327326015435
The difficulties of this difference are discussed below on the applicable level of ethical discussions.	0.41981488299894254
At the same time, knowledge of the danger is being made aware that in a maximal therapeutical orientated medical care system the desire for euthanasia may become identical with the reverse side of this care system.	0.5427662064900424
Isolated severe head trauma (SHT) or SHT in combination with multiple injuries are important factors for the prognosis of morbidity and mortality in patients suffering from the consequences of accidents.	0.733044591089396
The prognosis mainly depends on the presence of primary mechanic brain injury and the development of secondary brain damage.	0.488875230387945
Causes for the development of secondary brain damage are the intracranial space demand after traumatic injury and edema formation which may result in iscemia, as well as inflammatory processes.	0.4522625583380303
Both isolated SHT and polytrauma with or without brain damage may result in a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) due to the synthesis of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators which may cause a single or multiple organ failure (MOF).	0.6012567105427438
Often the organism is able to survive isolated traumatic injuries and functional disturbances, but in combination or cumulation they may be lethal.	0.6545167383418037
The hypermetabolism after SHT is often regarded as an interaction between the central nervous system and the whole organism by the activation of the neuroendocrine axis.	0.6429764374511705
In contrast to the consequences of SHT for the whole organism, multiple injuries after polytrauma may affect brain functions, such as the shock dependent disturbance of the brain perfusion accompanied by brain hypoxia which may lead to an aggravated prognosis.	0.6449497308795563
Moreover, coagulation, metabolism and fracture healing are influenced by the onset of SIRS as well.	0.4890011845077831
Our knowledge about the bidirectional inflammatory interaction between brain and whole organism is still limited.	0.5275146941132893
In this context, the effects of secondary surgical interventions which may additionally stress a traumatized body have to be considered and are the subject for actual clinical discussions and experimental studies.	0.6241911058745503
This article tries to summarize some important aspects on this topic.	0.2971010664655441
Background: Chronic cough and thoracic pain, commonly caused by upper airway infections, are frequently seen symptoms in pediatrics.	0.6273731883812304
These "benign" symptoms are very seldom caused by malignant disorders.	0.3912073562652
Methods: In two patients (male, age 41/12 and 43/12 years) chronic cough and thoracic pain were due to a malignant pulmonary neoplasm (Pleuropulmonary blastoma).	0.6491171919184777
Results: Pleuropulmonary blastoma is a rare malignant primary pulmonary neoplasm in childhood with a poor prognosis.	0.5852594984164009
An incomplete resection was performed in both cases.	0.7945534239641532
Both patients received postoperative radiotherapy and combination chemotherapy.	0.39454264350677526
One boy died, the other one is alive and well more than 6 years after diagnosis without evidence of disease.	0.800814472735472
Conclusion: Our findings indicate that even after incomplete resection subsequent multimodal therapy (adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy) can provide a long term remission.	0.6683226496559387
In 12 patients with systemic sclerosis the influence of hypnosis and autogenic training on the acral blood circulation and the coping with the disease was investigated in a pilot study.	0.6696754129572832
In the first step significant increases in the skin temperature of the fingers (mean +/- SD: 3.9 +/- 1.2  °C) could be found after relaxation hypnosis.	0.9151223753255833
In the second step six patients (study group) gained experience with autogenic training.	0.5531547140491988
The other six patients served as control group.	0.26323644101318533
In the study group, the skin temperature of the fingers (short-term effect) was significantly higher than in the control group (1.9 +/- 1.0  °C).	1.0174783112668278
Long-term effects of the autogenic training (mean acral rewarning time, duration and course of the Raynaud attacks, acral lesions of the hands, psychosomatic status of complaints, type of relation to the disease as precondition for coping with the disease) were not found within the relatively short follow-up period of 4 months.	0.864774380270378
Two patients, however, reported that they could shorten the duration of Raynaud attacks by autogenic training.	0.390474488586515
In our patients heterogenicity and an increased score of multiple psychosomatic complaints were registered at the outset.	0.5691723497142445
As far as the type of relation to the disease is concerned, the patients could be assessed as almost adapted.	0.8690477251359008
Hypnosis and autogenic training can be recommended as complementary therapy in systemic sclerosis.	0.5059421469326931
Abstract The term acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) reflects an acute worsening of the stable state with an increase in dyspnea, cough, and count or purulence of sputum.	0.5175017435903502
The management of an acute exacerbation is guided mainly clinical severity which has implications on the decision of outpatient management, hospital management or intensive care treatment.	0.6076837469199062
Cardiopulmonary comorbidity and the number of previous exacerbations are prognostic factors.	0.33013511369923526
The first-line therapy of each exacerbation is the intensification of drug-treatment with 2-agonists and anticholinergics.	0.6555442320836191
Systemic steroids as a short-term course are advocated if hospital-treatment is necessary.	0.6539290356176053
Infections of the respiratory tract are a frequent cause of acute exacerbations.	0.7481019071504983
However, a colonization with potential pathogenic microorganisms is found in many patients in the stable state.	0.7279972648596502
Antibiotic treatment is justified if cardiopulmonary comorbidity and frequent previous exacerbations are present.	0.5226617461027334
The severity of airflow obstruction and the frequency of previous exacerbations are linked to the spectrum of the underlying microorganisms.	0.6184667701719955
This should be borne in mind for the choice of the antimicrobiotic treatment.	0.4854465937275556
Noninvasive ventilation in severe exacerbation is able to improve gas-exchange and to reduce the work of breathing.	0.5419060334649579
As a consequence the number of intubations and the attributable morbidity and mortality are reduced.	0.6564527374806627
If invasive mechanical ventilation is necessary, the potential of dynamic hyperinflation in acute exacerbation has to be considered.	0.7369945823122372
Background: In 1986 Prof. H. Olbing (University of Essen Pediatrics Department), supported by Prof. G. Stickler (Mayo Medical School, Minnesota), introduced a 4-weeks clinical skills lab for all students (annual class 250), based on self-instruction by means of computer-assisted, interactive, audiovisual learning materials, models, bedside teaching and seminars on special topics (partially peer-guided).	0.4658765079683858
Each year 14 chosen senior medical students get a two weeks intensive training in order to function as peer tutors for the bedside teaching.	0.41068649911792576
The peer tutors train the junior students in basic behaviour and clinical examination skills.	0.3167932864993513
Each tutor is active during 4-5 skills lab periods, and in each period he/she coaches two groups of two students each.	0.6440881365274593
During the bedside teaching phase each group examines and presents four patients.	0.2917658357377452
Spinal injuries referring to banal falls are common injuries in elderly persons.	0.4411011495806093
Up to 55 years of age spinal fractures are more frequent in men while its opposite in older persons.	0.5268119165326869
There are two typical lesions: odontoid fracture in the upper cervical spine and compression fracture in thoracolumbar spine.	0.589933696322052
Odontoid fracture is the most frequent lesion in cervical spine in the elderly.	0.71726553605875
This is caused by trabecular structure of dens axis and spine's stiffness in old age.	0.3433642821692029
Instable fractures in extension type II are most common.	0.41231160932426275
In many cases the instability of the lesion is hidden and can be first seen in functional examination controlled by x-ray.	0.6523877279691858
Conservative treatment is efficient in stable lesions type III while there is a high risk for pseudarthrosis in treatment of instable lesions in elderly with Halo Fixateur e. g. We think that the best operation for these fractures is the anterior screw fixation.	0.6041794511767435
If this is not sufficient because of low bone mass or early dislocation of the screws a dorsal fusion C1/C2 with transarticular screwing e. g. should be done.	0.6144206614644407
Because of rare symptoms thoracolumbar fractures in osteoporosis are hidden frequently.	0.3339584823773262
In many cases it's not easy to distinguish acute lesions from healed fractures or tumor lesions.	0.47130939135729844
Therefore there are just few compression fractures (A type) that have to be treated operatively.	0.7803606017441129
Instable lesions type B and C must be operated as well in the elderly as in the young.	0.73696181711337
Because of low bone mass in elderly the dorsal instrumentation should include more than just the two injured segments.	0.38232460569316445
An even more adequate stabilisation is done with an additional vertebral replacement.	0.4453337359261832
Following curative minimal-invasive laser resection of T1-T3 laryngeal carcinomas, patients were subjected to an intensive voice rehabilitation.	0.5504251943679676
Therapy was effected twice a day for approximately 2 months, utilizing the concept of functional voice therapy.	0.47668187120068495
Before and after rehabilitation, acoustic analyses were made by using two different computer-supported measuring systems: (1) the "multidimensional voice program" (Kay Elementrics Corp.) and (2) a novel software program developed in Göttingen that includes a new voice quality parameter based on correlations between frequency bands.	0.6305984464520832
Acoustic analyses showed superiority of the glottal versus supraglottal compensatory phonation.	0.3408850063820807
Findings showed that not all acoustic parameters equally documented voice improvement after rehabilitation.	0.34285072066688693
The standard deviation of fundamental frequency was the only parameter showing a significant post-therapeutic improvement.	0.46462414062356394
A further suitable acoustic method proved to be the voice quality parameter that has been newly introduced by us.	0.6027498342748532
In contrast to analogous parameters of other methods, this approach is independent of the exact periodicity of the glottal excitation function, thus permitting reliable results to be obtained even with aphonic or heavily dysphonic voices.	0.62524235656304
Aseptic pseudarthrosis may occur after all kinds of traumatology treatment.	0.3825928611397711
Following conservative treatment, incomplete immobilisation or an unattached bone fragment can be causal.	0.3608644129264192
After plate osteosynthesis the biomechanical principles are not efficient or the circulatory damage delays healing.	0.3867347581061006
There are two broad types of pseudarthrosis: vascular and nonvascular.	0.515638066066965
The extent of vascularisation can be demonstrated by bone scintigraphy as well as X-ray.	0.5965811301878762
The treatment of vascular nonunions is very common.	0.4477508703138102
Mechanical stability is required, therefore a new osteosynthesis is desirable.	0.6353105552910541
Osteoporosis caused by inactivity and dislocation increases the rate of complications.	0.41694071573584207
Much more difficult problems are encountered in treatment of unreactive and avital pseudarthrosis, particularly in cases with a defect of bone substance.	0.7121844231977247
These defects can be treated with a segment transfer and a fibula-to-tibia operation.	0.5964543869349144
Extracorporal lithotripsy has been established as a new method in treatment of active and vascular nonunions.	0.7286324199430605
Former osteosynthesis is not a contraindication.	0.6027309526879844
Stability and immobilisation are necessary.	0.2315324549678297
Treatment in the low-frequency magnetic field shows no effect.	0.6353359849941945
Correct biomechanical and biological osteosynthesis with proper attention paid to location, quality of bone and asepsis can avoid the development of a pseudarthrosis.	0.5737649787743755
Aim of the study: The goal of this study was to assess the prevalence of ophthalmological abnormalities in 10 year old survivors with extremely low birthweight of 500-999 g. In addition the association between retinopathy of prematurity and other ophthalmological disorders was studied.	0.6480343531607864
Background: Although the majority of surgeons regard Hartmann's operation as therapeutic standard in perforations of the colon complicated by peritonitis this procedure has been critically discussed in recent years.	0.6101833082235445
Advocates of one-stage techniques criticized bad postoperative results (high morbidity and mortality) and long-term outcome (low rates of intestinal restoration).	0.7508700306482714
The aim of our study was to investigate whether the late results after Hartmann's operation justify this criticism.	0.6412449637587132
Method: From 1982 to 1997 Hartmann's operations were performed in 103 patients for colonic perforations.	0.5792477107398015
In 63 % of cases inflammatory diseases caused colonic complications.	0.7152614652768977
The average Mannheimer Peritonitis Index (MPI) was 19.	0.5206409995040582
Seventeen patients died postoperatively (mortality: 16.5 %).	0.5514108718028514
In 69 patients (80 %) intestinal restoration could be performed after an average interval of 122 days (complication rate: 6 %, no mortality).	0.6973196655162299
On follow-up, patients were asked to give information on their general state, changes of housing, abdominal complaints, and quality of life.	0.7325817820087013
Results: Data on 93 % of patients could be obtained.	0.8548790518809215
The median follow-up time was 75 months.	0.5437088596932
Eleven patients had died; the remaining 72 were investigated.	0.6368980708823146
86 % described the quality of their lives as good or very good; only 11 % indicated severe loss of activity.	0.5666243309446253
Quality of life did not differ between patients in whom intestinal continuity had been restored and those in whom it had not been restored.	0.6859326325058409
Anastomotic strictures developed in 7 % of cases, always after stapled anastomosis.	0.616065654143705
Conclusions: According to our results, long-term outcome after Hartmann's operation is good.	0.7094138538992469
80 % of patients underwent intestinal restoration with low morbidity (6 %) and no mortality.	0.945001242433095
A great majority of patients indicated the quality of their lives as good or very good: this assessment was not dependent on restoration of intestinal continuity.	0.5295454847107066
Tibial torsion defects are usually not clinically evident and, hence, are often overlooked.	0.6431784497188415
Clinical examination and CT scan have proved to be the best ways of measuring static tibial torsion, whereas dynamic measurements are usually performed in the clinic and the "gait laboratory."	0.6931820516293843
Only few studies have determined there to be a connection between a torsion defect in the lower leg and expected pathological conditions of the knee and ankle joints.	0.8119564002793674
However, patellofemoral instability, Osgood-Schlatter disease, osteochondrosis dissecans are increasingly being found in cases of increased external tibial torsion and arthrosis in reduced torsion.	0.48903655799911055
The aim of this study was to ascertain to what extent homeless, mentally ill subjects in Munich take advantage of available psychosocial services.	0.47829368160017516
To obtain a representative picture of the situation, the first step was to ascertain how many people in Munich are actually homeless.	0.7537362115403328
The next step was to ascertain what proportion of them are in need of psychotherapy.	0.6349310675344243
Using the standardized Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS), 146 men and 32 women were interviewed.	0.37779896944677693
The results according to the DSM-III demonstrated high lifelong and 6-month prevalence of psychic disturbances.	0.5499169517455339
Medical and social services were often enjoyed, but mostly over a short period of time in particularly critical situations.	0.5945031340270149
Women were treated more often than men.	0.4110213005426939
Elements such as age and level of education hardly influenced patients' seeking help.	0.4474931740213979
Despite a high prevalence of addictive disease, alcohol and drug clinics were rarely consulted.	0.4274525495804594
The increase in the number of diagnoses was paralleled by an increase in the number of patients seeking help.	0.5490344072304838
Most treatments involved schizophrenia and anxiety.	0.16183484497640208
By means of logistic regression models, predictors of the extent to which these services were used were analysed.	0.5160928012017287
We conclude that new clinical models are needed and that the aversion to the present care system is too great.	0.5503271462831246
Continued treatment occurs only rarely.	0.17007170968445187
Electrocardiographic and clinical characteristics are currently used as diagnostic criteria for the long QT-syndrome.	0.621084462013632
In borderline electrocardiographic findings associated with unclear syncope, it is often difficult to ensure or exclude long QT-syndrome.	0.5782630572585647
Schwartz and coworkers therefore created a point system as a guide in clinical decision making.	0.3204855544912612
In recent years genetic diagnostics have entered the arena of long-QT assessment.	0.4979601363889936
Aside from new insights into the pathophysiology of the long QT-disorder, it is expected that genetic diagnostics will offer substantial help to ascertain long QT-syndrome in patients with borderline electrocardiographic and clinical findings and improve risk stratification in long-QT family members.	0.68793123785298
Performing linkage analysis, coupling of autosomal-dominant congenital long QT-syndrome (Romano-Ward Syndrome) to chromosomes 11 (LQT1/11p15.5), 3 (LQT3/3p21), 7 (LQT2/7q35), and 4 (LQT4/4q25-27) was demonstrated.	0.657037205828373
More recently, the disease genes in long QT-syndrome 1, 2, and 3 could be identified.	0.9186459825010301
Analysis of the base-pair sequence allowed detection of several different mutations in different families illustrating genetic heterogeneity.	0.4565328891933695
Aside from diagnostic aspects, molecular genetics may also guide pharmacological therapy by identifying the specific ion-channel disorder leading to QT-prolongation and sudden death.	0.4019117141366666
During the past 4 years we have demonstrated in eyes with corneal pathology that applanation tonometry (Goldmann, Perkins) generally delivers falsely low measurements in comparison to intraocular needle tonometry.	0.4759460490209136
The aim of this study was to evaluate whether impression tonometry (Schioetz) is more precise than applanation tonometry in determinating the intraocular pressure in eyes with corneal disorders.	0.6450787826827908
The case of a 24-year-old woman with a plunging ranula is reported.	0.6646914700714511
Primarily, the patient noticed extensive swelling of the neck, which had developed 3 months previously.	0.9230110186868797
The polycystic, firmly attached tumor and the sublingual and submandibular glands of the right side of the neck were surgically removed.	0.6245166523120843
Pathological examination showed a retention cyst by means of a plunging ranula.	0.4647328424517425
The etiology, pathogenesis, clinical aspect and diagnostic procedures for the plunging ranula are described.	0.5342605718685194
Various therapeutic possibilities are discussed in regard to their value.	0.6527213037954321
We prefer surgical treatment with a histological examination to verify the diagnosis.	0.680630953647159
The plunging ranula originates on the sublingual gland; therefore, its simultaneous extirpation is recommended to avoid recurrences.	0.4818324365867366
In extensive cases, the additional removal of the submandibular gland can be advised.	0.5372063278937023
Cranial dural fistulae are rare; when they occur, it is usually difficult to detect them at an early stage.	0.6830936281968104
With a view to the question of possible progress in diagnosis we now report on seven patients with lateral dural fistulae fed by branches of the external carotid artery.	0.5454900869277062
The examination was carried out before selective arteriography using cw-Doppler sonography and colour coded duplex sonography in combination.	0.5152604794755331
Sonographic criteria for detection of hyperperfusion take account of flow velocity as well as pulsatility.	0.4336915729174789
In all cases hyperperfusion of the external carotid artery and the common carotid artery was detected.	0.6878826439564018
In most of these cases pathologic findings were also observed at the occipital artery, and more rarely in the contralateral external carotid artery or the ipsilateral vertebral artery, in addition.	0.8224938696000867
A possible source of error arising from confusion of blood vessels was present with the cw-Doppler sonography, but not for colour coded duplex sonography.	0.6670869247038682
Therefore, cranial dural fistulae characterized by a high shunt volume can be diagnosed correctly by indirect Doppler sonographic criteria using cw-Doppler and duplex sonography.	0.5888380303903876
Direct visualization of the fistula and its nidus requires additional selective arteriography, in the course of which endovascular embolization may be performed.	0.649445621411503
Background: Echocardiography is a standard imaging technique for the assessment of heart valve disease.	0.634370966566614
The good spatial and temporal resolution is the basis for different methods which provide information about the severity of such defects.	0.6256202435814419
Dynamic colour visualisation and volumetric measurements of regurgitant jets are a new evaluating tool for the assessment of heart valve insufficiencies.	0.411086178771383
In Germany, as in all industrial nations, there has been an increase in the number of cases of cancer and in cancer-related mortality.	0.843165670044482
According to the German Federal Bureau of Statistics, in 1998 nearly 213,000 persons died due to malignant cancer.	0.6148283235101221
Cancer patients generally have physical and psychological dysfunction that may in turn cause a significant reduction in quality of life if treatment is performed insufficiently or not at all.	0.526823513236769
Pain is the dominant symptom and can have serious effects on the patient and his or her family.	0.7525514528349231
Although various organizations have published treatment plans for adequate pain therapy, in many cases they are not adequately applied by physicians.	0.6459326200350121
This work therefore offers a comprehensive review of pain therapy as an essential component of palliative medicine.	0.5552520407200667
This retrospective study shows the results in 30 patients of revision surgery on their reruptured ACL.	0.6787736564161632
The follow-up time was 30 months on average (range 10 - 54 months).	0.7150111093520125
The follow-up examination included subjective (Lysholm score, Tegner activity level rating score), clinical and radiological criteria and also instrumental laxity testing with the KT-1000 arthrometer.	0.5987358584453422
The overall evaluation was done according to the IKDC score.	0.4270478640999217
The follow up showed subjective and objective results almost equal to those after primary surgery on ACL.	0.5928191445568376
The IKDC score revealed certain abnormal and highly abnormal results, which demonstrated that revision ACL surgery gives poorer results than primary surgery.	0.44321719560396183
Nevertheless, we recommend reconstruction of a torn ACL even in a revision case to restore the knee function and prevent further menisceal and chondral damage and degeneration.	0.6382217782431555
Nowadays, restorative proctocolectomy is considered the "gold standard" in the surgical therapy of ulcerative colitis.	0.7558956792073268
Alternative procedures such as Brooke ileostomy or Kock pouch are limited to special indications.	0.3421725638723448
Preservation of function is the decisive advantage of the ileoanal pouch, but preservation of function is not equal to quality of life.	0.6577904047268122
Quality of life is a multidimensional concept that is difficult to define and measure.	0.5402729676087169
Quality of life can only be assessed by standardized and validated quality-of-life questionnaires.	0.6951933801594428
Preoperatively, patients with ulcerative colitis have a restricted quality of life, depending on the intensity of their disease.	0.5964530107014057
Proctocolectomy is the curative therapy and improves quality of life.	0.41832933682054974
When evaluating quality of life it is not essential if patients are treated by Brooke ileostomy or restorative proctocolectomy.	0.6528043960697891
The advantage of restorative proctocolectomy is the improvement in some aspects such as sexuality and physical acticity.	0.5741159873814892

In eight cadaveric hip joints (age 18-75 yrs.)	0.4966403437371571
the reaction forces were applied corresponding to four phases of the gait cycle (heel strike, mid-stance, heel off, toe off) and the pressure distribution determined with FUJI pressure sensitive film.	0.5086748927908351
We found maxima of 10 MPa during mid stance.	0.284232542344117
The areas of highest pressure were located in the ventro-superior aspect of the acetabulum (anterior part of the acetabular roof) and in the dorso-inferior aspect of the lunate surface.	0.7697610872495917
The pressure distribution was relatively constant during the four phases and the maxima did not vary proportional to the applied load.	0.43115184313744753
The normal pressure distribution in the hip appears to be determined by the physiological incongruity of the articular surfaces and the inhomogeneous bony support of the acetabulum.	0.7982766207796106

The debate on passive and active euthanasia has met a controversial echo both in the German-speaking media and in professional publications within recent years.	0.4934674993835975
This discussion, however, largely excluded mentally ill  patients.	0.3471806212846312
Also, euthanasia advocacy groups have usually distanced themselves from  euthanasia in psychiatric patients.	0.34294112560717704
We report here two cases from our hospital in which in-patients with affective disorders committed assisted suicide during a hospital pass.	0.5748745667759083

Currently undergoing a clinical trial a new miniaturized monoplane ultrasound probe potentially enhances the practicability of perioperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) without loss of echocardiographic quality.	0.4267733854547965
Methods: In the present prospective study, the nasally inserted miniaturized TEE probe was tested in 12 ventilated patients and compared with a conventional TEE probe.	0.8772381008603902
Echocardiographic quality was tested by two independent investigators by analyzing the percentage of the endocardium contour detection (<50%, 50-75%, 75-100%) in the left ventricular short- and long-axis views.	0.8505933225538742
Results: In 11 patients, more than 50% of endocardium were visualized continuously with both probes.	0.7565181944891222
Although the nasal TEE probe was inferior to conventional TEE in detecting lateral endocardium, automated endocardium detection compared well with both methods.	0.45197138089340555
Inter- and intraobserver variability in manual measurements of the left ventricular cross-sectional area was below 5% on average and differed non-significantly with regard to the method.	0.7461957096925287
In 2 patients, continuous monitoring was aggravated by repeated loss of contact between the miniaturized TEE probe and mucosa.	0.454089107253161

CCDS revealed tortuosity of finger arteries as typical finding in thrombangiitis obliterans.	0.26413553095495745
Segmental stenosis can either be identified morphologically or quantified by measurement of the flow velocity with poststenotic maximal systolic velocities of less than 20 cm/s or by the acceleration of the blood flow within the stenosis, as proven by angiographic examinations.	0.5879604401928193
CCDS is suitable for evaluation of acral perfusion in patients suffering from secondary Raynaud's syndrome.	0.41685044926768233

In the case of one patient with dysthymia (ICD-10 RC: F34.1) psychotherapists tended more towards a reactive or neurotic etiology than psychiatrists.	0.4712094346718082
By contrast, the percentage of clinicians suspecting an endogenous etiology and thus, diagnosing a psychosis and starting a psychopharmacotherapy was markedly higher among psychiatrists.	0.43843688922461727
In conclusion, the integration of different conceptualizations and treatment modalities is emphasized as an essential task for both psychotherapists and psychiatrists.	0.6227915879739685
For certain patients, an integrated therapy may be more effective.	0.6900575871252417
A 43-year-old patient was admitted for severe claudicatio in his right leg, doppler ultrasound and angiography revealed an occluded right common iliac artery.	0.5733575552406288
Using the cross-over-approach from the contralateral side, it was possible to navigate a guide wire through the occlusion, and after passage with an excimer laser an ipsilateral retrograde puncture with placement of a sheath was performed.	0.632041278301903
In order to protect the the aortoiliac bifurcation, a primary stent implantation of the occluded side was carried out using the kissing balloon technique.	0.6632892490779896
Afterwards three stents were placed.	0.16338290225649074
Subsequently the patient completely improved; treadmill exercise test and duplex sonography showed good results.	0.4052988817338677
Conclusion: Using the kissing balloon technique, laser-assisted recanalisation of iliac artery occlusions even involving the aortoiliac bifurcation compare favorable to other more invasive treatments.	0.5064925873373016
A surgical procedure can thus be avoided.	0.5283275521715808
The typical MRI features of the most common pancreatic diseases, such as pancreatitis and adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, have been established.	0.8106077739814928
However, even in these common pancreatic disorders, MRI correlation with the underlying pathology is limited for clinical reasons.	0.7219955847925356
We emphasize MR-pathological correlation of inflammatory and neoplastic pancreatic changes, including pancreatitis, adenocarcinoma, acinar cell carcinoma, rare cystic and solid pancreatic neoplasms, and islet cell tumors.	0.566873751944303
By highlighting the correlation of key pathological features with MR findings, a better understanding of the MR appearance of pancreatic pathology can be provided.	0.5548946358953667
In addition, MRI may prove a powerful tool in detection and characterization of pancreatic tumors.	0.5280678411355697
Background: The implantation of a femoro-popliteal bypass graft represents the gold standard in the management of arteriosclerotic occlusive disease in the femoro-popliteal region.	0.6020830888620909
Application of interventional techniques has permitted the development of a novel, endovascular implantable bypass system.	0.4260970881138706
The device is placed within the lumen of the superficial femoral artery.	0.40649115915793477
The present study investigated the technical properties of the new system in cadavers, with subsequent evaluation of its application in humans.	0.8020266577405272
Methods: The endopass consists of a thin-wall polycarbourethane tube with a total length of 53 cm.	0.6728406447758781
The distal end is connected with a self-expanding stent prothesis 4 cm in length.	0.4758245261942526
Endovascular implantation is performed through a groin incision.	0.2881719662942792
Following antegrade ringstripper-TEA, the endopass is introduced into the femoral artery after placement of a guide wire.	0.679244852225036
The proximal anastomosis is performed surgically.	0.27130729171735485
Results: The technical requirements and feasibility of the system were tested on 12 cadaver extremities.	0.7264076934946746
Implantation of the device proved technically successful in seven of eight extremities with significant occlusion of the superficial femoral artery.	0.5518935721104166
The most important problems included the complete ringstripper-TEA, the placement of the guide wire following the TEA, and the expansion of the endopass.	0.7059885514465568
Following approval by the ethics commission, the endopass was implanted in five patients between June 1997 and March 1998.	0.6852723469780136
In three patients, the endopass remained patent and has functioned well.	0.6970863895185542
One patient with poor vascular outflow suffered an early noncorrectable occlusion, while in the remaining case, perforation secondary to the ringstripper procedure forced us to abandon the attempt.	0.6169812068081362
Conclusion: Experience from the cadaver study and initial human applications confirm the feasibility of this method.	0.5272539403336202
Further development and methodological improvement, however, are necessary requiring additional, larger studies on patients.	0.5958023401971696
Introduction: There is no data available on the action of etomidate on ion currents in human neuronal cells.	0.6358598993792084
Therefore the effects of etomidate on a human neuronal delayed rectifer potassium current were investigated.	0.37168265400977907
In order to evaluate patients' exposure to radiation in computed tomography, dose quantities such as the computed tomography dose index (CTDI), multiple scan average dose (MSAD) and dose free in air on the axis of rotation are used.	0.587604635177523
The CTDI and the MSAD, derivable from the CTDI, are a good measure for the absorbed doses in the examined volume, but they do not take the biological sensitivity of the organs into account and do not describe the radiogenic risk that is actually relevant for patients and doctors.	0.6251866730243837
The dose on the axis of rotation is not an accurate measure of the effective dose and the radiogenic risk.	0.5751625607023869
The declaration of a limit for the dose on the axis of rotation should take the different regions into account, in order to guarantee acceptable image quality on one hand and to avoid an unnecessarily high risk on the other side.	0.6340313370711351
As physical dose quantities, the CTDI, MSAD and dose on the axis of rotation are useful to characterize and differentiate between programs and systems concerning radiation exposure.	0.4322138332587671
Prognosis of patients surviving acute myocardial infarction has substantially improved over the last two decades.	0.6453061310592028
However, stratification of patients at risk for death due to arrhythmic events remains a clinical challenge.	0.614190684043446
Due to the important role of the autonomic nervous system in the genesis of sudden death, autonomic markers such as heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity have recently gained attention as risk stratification parameters.	0.6516932623406315
The present study reports the results of noninvasive risk stratification in 411 consecutive postinfarction patients treated due to contemporary therapeutical guidelines with a high proportion of patients discharged with a patent infarct related artery.	0.5992266772971052
The diagnostic arsenal of risk parameters comprised heart rate variability, baroreflex sensitivity, and more traditional markers such as non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, left ventricular ejection fraction, and ventricular late potentials.	0.5781790123791137
Patiens were followed for a mean of 33  +/- 21 months.	0.6646025409836421
Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that left ventricular function, both autonomic markers, and the patency of the infarct related artery were independent predictors of the prospectively defined primary study endpoint, i.e., all-cause mortality plus ventricular tachyarrhythmic events.	0.6278016184351615
With respect to the secondary endpoint (ventricular tachyarrhythmic events), left ventricular function, heart rate variability, and infarct vessel patency were independent predictors.	0.6678184298707136
Ventricular late potentials and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia had no predictive value with respect to ventricular tachyarrhythmic events.	0.4302705498038818
These findings from a large prospective long-term study demonstrate the value of markers of cardiac autonomic tone in identifying infarct survivors at risk for malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death.	0.5042651127055255
K+ Channels and Cardiotoxicity of Drugs: Implications for Drug Toxicity Assessment - The time required for repolarization of the ventricles can be measured as the QT interval of the ECG and is determined primarily by activation of the delayed rectifier K+ current (IK), which consists of a rapid component (IKr) and a slow component (IKs).	0.6811349468891137
Drugs that block cardiac IKr prolong the cardiac action potential (AP).	0.2866045146932586
Prolonged repolarization is detected as a longer QT interval on the ECG.	0.3199509234373356
During prolonged APs, increased inward currents induce early afterdepolarizations, which increase the risk of Torsades de pointes (TdP) cardiac arrhythmias.	0.4913075103170598
TdP arrhythmia is characterized by an apparent twisting of the electrical axis around the isoelectric line.	0.38871536469498075
It has a rate of 150 to 250 beats/min and it can occasionally degenerate into ventricular fibrillation that may be fatal.	0.6046528204786045
The incidence of drug-induced TdP arrhythmias is highest among class IA and class III antiarrhythmic agents.	0.47799926960676603
However, under certain clinical conditions, also several non-cardiovascular medicinal products induce QT interval prolongations in the ECG or TdP arrhythmias.	0.5350776026841417
Since all drugs known to cause TdP block IKr, an early evaluation of possible effects on APs of cardiac myocytes expressing IKr channels during the developmental phases of novel drugs seems to be recommended.	0.560271511605246
If in-vitro electrophysiological studies show the new active substance to induce AP prolongation and/or K+ channel blockade in appropriate models and at relevant concentrations,  either further development of the new active substance may not be justified or the risk factors predisposing to TdP arrhythmias should be taken into account in further clinical studies.	0.649408255281553
Carcinoma of the penis is a malignant epithelial tumor of ominous prognosis if not adequately treated.	0.5237065672562494
