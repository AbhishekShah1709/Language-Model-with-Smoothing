The reason is as follows: this issue concerns no less than 1 800 000 employees within the European Union.	0.6898705477333927
We already have a directive.	0.5494136607519966
It is not an old one, it was issued in 1997.	1.1493206796166366
Deciding upon future policy lines, with a view to a new directive, rather hastily, without having had time to consult the trade unions or have discussions with all the social partners, I feel, runs counter to the spirit we wish to inject into the debate on matters which directly involve the social operators.	0.8363339073636805
I propose, therefore, that we should keep the arrangements as per the agenda, with the debate on Friday and the vote at a later date.	0.7848244538889011
Madam President, I clearly owe Mr Wurtz an explanation, and I am going give this explanation before the whole House.	0.8498862263564833
We had reached this agreement on principle in the Conference of Presidents.	0.5569242023272222
At the time, I did not know that Commissioner Bolkestein was going to appear next week before the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism to discuss this matter.	0.751935556889959
My group has debated this matter and considers that, given the current situation of the whole process of market integration and deregulation in such a sensitive area, it is appropriate that Parliament makes an initial statement, regardless of any action it may take in the future, so that Commissioner Bolkestein may take good note and in order to guide next week' s debate.	0.8081205781996058
Madam President, I should simply like to ask Mr Wurtz to take a second look at what this is about.	1.0762453077531158
It has nothing to do with any disputes on the substance; it is just about the following question: when will the Commission - having already had a year and a half to do this - finally be in a position to table the directive?	0.8209434391809309
Our sole intention in tabling the motion is to ensure that the deadlines which were promised are now finally adhered to, and it is therefore important that we act as quickly as possible.	0.728619372261841
That is why I should like to support the Social Democrats' request to hold the vote on Friday.	0.9781804286419493
(Parliament gave its assent)	0.038249974869252856
Madam President, as you know the Cederschiöld report has been taken off Thursday' s agenda. That ought to mean that we have more time on Thursday.	1.0457465226631935
Since we will be very pressed for time in the topical and urgent debate, in view of the many matters to be addressed in an hour and a half, I simply wanted to ask whether the sessional services might not check to see whether we could have an extra half an hour for the topical and urgent debate so that there is sufficient speaking time.	0.8752404299276944
In general the way in which sittings have been managed in recent weeks seems to me to have been very chaotic.	0.8445492387326731
Last Thursday speaking times were extremely tight and then suddenly we had between one and one-and-a-half hours when there was nothing on the agenda and we had to wait for the vote.	0.5922722170100163
On Friday of this week we have one single item on the agenda.	0.5102288845640188
That is absolutely absurd.	0.3463433000541996
I really should like to ask that a review be carried out of the way in which sittings are managed.	0.863570043392777
This sounds perfectly feasible. We shall therefore see if we can extend the urgent debate by a half hour, considering the withdrawal of Mrs Cederschiöld' s report.	0.8417686475373122
This is all I am talking about here, just that.	0.8801422939087812
Madam President, I would like to talk about an item on the agenda for Wednesday, which you have not yet announced.	1.1041451369420885
I understand that there is no argument about the fact that the Council declaration, on the next sitting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, is not going to include the declaration on the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, and that this declaration has been proposed for the plenary part-session in March, so that it may be delivered in a solemn and formal way.	0.928314747915297
I understand that there is agreement on this issue.	0.8697961946954941
Madam President, this afternoon, in this Chamber, reference was made to a series of reports on the BBC Today programme this morning, which claimed that certain of my colleagues were running personal lobbying companies or somehow misusing their position as Members of this House.	0.7567285558521227
These are serious allegations.	0.38307597535564275
They are completely untrue, malicious, politically biased and were broadcast in the full knowledge of their falsehood.	0.4278784274465211
We are taking legal advice.	0.48091530460012
My colleagues' register of interests is complete.	0.510733737081506
If we find that any Member of this House or their employees collaborated with the BBC in this farrago we will expose them to the opprobrium of this House.	0.6677473767838754
Quite, we agree absolutely.	0.9494785192914099
b) Sittings of 1 and 2 March 2000 in Brussels	0.533732810134688
Sustainable urban development - rural development - EQUAL initiative	0.6609190836119037
. (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners and members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I was given the task of drawing up the European Parliament' s report on the Community Initiative Programme INTERREG III.	0.8194459838680486
Upon referral to committee, we examined over a hundred amendments and, so far, 17 amendments, some of which have already been presented in committee, have once again been tabled.	0.948613027601206
Before discussing the content of the resolution, I should like to inform you of the elements which I took account of and which guided my work as rapporteur.	0.7102195439254609
First of all, I would like to remind you of the function of the INTERREG Community initiative, founded on the principle of transnationality and innovation.	0.6071746447309098
This programme constitutes a driving force for development on the European scale.	0.6634035465157305
INTERREG is one of the four Community initiatives scheduled for the period 2000-2006, and is the one with the largest budget for implementation, i.e. EUR 4.875 billion as opposed to EUR 3.604 billion at the present time.	0.7183415278061047
The INTERREG initiative, created in 1990, is built upon the wish to make the regions of Europe ready for a 'Europe without frontiers' in the context of establishing the great single market.	0.7913779120719913
At the time of the reform of the Structural Funds in 1994 and 1996, the INTERREG CIP has incorporated new strands contributing to the development of trans-European transport and energy distribution networks.	0.8317742421287939
These programmes promoted cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation within the European Union by encouraging balanced development of the Community area.	0.6462406441975403
The INTERREG III programme, for which we have before us today the guidelines issued by the European Commission, pursuant to the terms of European Community Regulation No 1260 de 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds, continues these measures.	0.7643139125208288
It is based on three strands. strand A organises cross-border cooperation between regional and local authorities in border regions, at both internal and external borders of the European Union, on the basis of joint cross-border development strategies which Member States' local and regional authorities are responsible for implementing. strand B governs transnational cooperation between national, regional and local authorities in various Member States or applicant countries regarding regional development, transport networks and the environment.	0.8603273324415962
Member States, i.e. national authorities, are responsible for implementing this strand. Finally, strand C organises interregional cooperation between different regions of the Member States or third countries to exchange experience under strands A and B and cooperate in the fields of research and technological development, subject to consultation with the European Commission which is responsible for its implementation.	0.7739722707184643
The new INTERREG programme, in the form in which we have received it, takes into consideration the needs engendered by enlargement to the countries of Eastern and Central Europe and to island regions and most remote regions.	0.9567856218972701
The Commission proposes redistributing the INTERREG funding as follows: between 50 and 80% for strand A, 6% for strand C, and the remainder for strand B, i.e. from 14 up to a maximum of 44%.	0.7304355039017991
The European Commission draws up the list of eligible regions for strand A and strand B. It bases its assessment principally on the map of regions eligible during the previous programming period.	0.6332569702830892
The most remote regions may benefit from support under strand B. The Commission draws up a list of priority areas and eligible measures which for strand A is not comprehensive, but is comprehensive for strand B. The Commission reserves the option to, at a later date, put forward topics it considers important to the exchange of experience and strengthened cooperation between regions, for strand C.	0.858537024790296
The adoption procedure for the programmes is established by the general regulations on Structural Funds.	0.7549541449523612
Proposals are drawn up by Member States and are submitted for approval to the European Commission, which checks their conformity with the general guidelines, adopted.	0.9773678782752739
These proposals must include a number of elements, an overview of the cross-border or transnational priorities and strategies, a description of the measures necessary to their implementation and an indicative financial plan.	0.7646992772955072
I belong to the great majority of Members of Parliament who voted in favour of continuing the INTERREG Community Initiative Programme. I regret that Parliament was not informed about the appraisal of the previous programme, which would have enabled the new measures implemented to reach optimum efficiency, but I acknowledge that this was not an easy operation.	1.0047697934549578
I also regret the fact that we had an extremely short period to work in, as the text was examined in parliamentary committee on 24 November last year and then on 26 January. I further regret the fact that neither the regions, nor the representative regional organisations were involved in framing the programme.	0.819868639539214
In promoting cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation, this cross-disciplinary instrument is the very incarnation of a regional policy on the European scale intended to encourage harmonious and balanced development of the Community territory.	0.8142389073571279
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the conference on rural development held in Cork from 7 to 9 November 1996 set rural development as one of the European Union' s priorities since it is essential in order to maintain the existence and continued development of agriculture, to provide farmers with an environment containing the necessary infrastructure and services, and to ensure greater respect for the environment and a better quality of life, diversification and job creation.	0.7802059486689792
An integrated development policy for all rural areas in the European Union is therefore needed, consisting of the following elements: an integrated, multi-sectoral approach, simplification of administrative procedures, improvement of the partnership between European institutions and national and local actors and protection of the environment.	0.7665085325960765
In its 1998 policy paper, Agenda 2000, the Commission set out two key principles on which rural development policy should be based: the recognition of the multifunctionality of agriculture and the need for an integrated strategy for developing rural areas.	0.8285371403695463
The first principle means creating a new 'pact' between farmers and society, making the farmer 'steward of the countryside' and ensuring that society is prepared to pay for the environmental services needed to safeguard the countryside' s recreation value.	0.6841160932685674
The second principle is based on the fact that nowadays many of the job opportunities in rural areas are outside the traditional agricultural sector, so that a complete development programme which integrates rural development policies with agricultural sector policies needs to be implemented. In this way rural development is becoming a pillar of the CAP.	0.8453138384402099
The LEADER Community initiative was launched in 1991 to promote a new bottom-up approach to rural development and to diversify measures by adapting them to local needs.	0.5745519307781615
The following objectives were set: improving the development potential of rural areas by calling upon local initiative; promoting the acquisition of knowledge in the rural development sector; disseminating this knowledge to other rural areas.	0.463274929377074
LEADER I applied to the rural areas covered by Structural Fund Objectives 1 and 5b, and 217 local action groups participated in it, with financing of EUR 1 155 million.	0.7090627900875391
LEADER II (1994-1999), for which a total evaluation has, unfortunately, not yet been completed, had a wider scope than LEADER I: there were probably over 800 beneficiaries and the sums allocated, after reallocation of resources, probably amounted to over EUR 4 000 million.	0.7959370760296226
In October 1999, following the success of LEADER I and LEADER II, the Commission decided to extend the initiative.	0.8020098992075769
For the 2000-2006 period provision has been made, unfortunately, only for a total contribution of EUR 2 020 million, and an indicative allocation for each Member State has been set.	0.8230750542357274
LEADER+ differs from the previous stages in that all rural areas will be eligible. It is also more ambitious, and better geared to the challenges which rural areas will have to meet.	0.9217484340136447
The main changes are as follows: all rural areas will be eligible to benefit from LEADER+; the selection criteria for local measures will be more rigorous; integrated local development plans will be introduced as priority themes, such as the use of information technology, improving the quality of life, and adding value to local products.	0.7470061270393545
I therefore approve of the continuation of the initiative because, as I was saying, it emphasises the innovative development strategies and because it is more ambitious, even though there is still the need to make the criteria by which areas qualify as rural more flexible so as not to penalise rural areas with high or low population densities.	0.9208939267208459
I believe the networking system to be vital for the exchange of information and skills and for the implementation of joint projects between different areas of the Union and I repeat that in order to be fully successful it must exploit inter alia measures already in existence, such as the Carrefours.	0.8861504736771542
I share the Commission' s preference for the use of global grants while urging, however, that the accounting requirements of national and regional authorities should be precisely and painstakingly defined.	0.636794162203827
I regret the delay with which LEADER, as was the case with the other three initiatives, was presented to Parliament and for the knock-on delay this entailed for the whole procedure.	0.9408343752087946
Finally, I am concerned by the paucity of the amount allocated, if you consider, in addition, that this time the programme is available to all the countries of the Union and will be implemented for a year longer than the previous LEADER II.	1.2756510356038666
I would like to thank the Commission services for their helpfulness and cooperation, and I would like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture for the contribution they have made through their amendments.	0.9511461810798161
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, my report on EQUAL takes the form of an opinion delivered as part of the process of consultation on a new Community initiative, whose objective is to promote transnational cooperation and through it new methods of combating all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market.	0.7220877193605876
The report was a major undertaking because it also incorporates opinions from four further committees - from the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, and the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.	0.7285055440179302
This Community initiative succeeds the two forerunner programmes ADAPT and EMPLOYMENT and has a much smaller budget of around EUR 2.8 billion.	0.552733310638931
The initiative adopts a completely new approach, which is to develop innovative employment models within transnational geographical or sectoral development partnerships.	0.6633363179436694
The intention is clear: targeted projects are to be developed at transnational level, projects which are based on the employment policy guidelines of employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities.	0.7444299239412835
This objective is very much to be welcomed and also meets with a broad consensus in this House.	0.9411252881156728
In addition, EQUAL should feed into the National Action Plans for employment and its implementation should be able to be monitored through these Action Plans.	0.6711970441504311
It is an important Community initiative which, together with the three other initiatives, URBAN, LEADER and INTERREG, is financed out of the Structural Funds.	0.898833470304026
In my report I have tried to reduce excessive administrative expenditure and to build greater openness and flexibility into the system of development partnerships.	0.648741044312192
I consider technical support to be necessary but, given the problems with the former TAOs, no new TAOs should be set up without Parliament' s approval so as to prevent political responsibility from being passed down to the technical assistance level.	0.7888572096358398
Nevertheless, technical assistance is necessary.	0.6654491599085897
Particular attention is also paid to the dissemination of results and learning from each other by identifying best practice, with special emphasis on mainstreaming.	0.6373828859081165
I have endeavoured to secure the widest possible support for the report.	0.7188472231949194
This has meant a reduction in the number of amendments - from over 100 in committee to 22 for the plenary - which has also created numerous opportunities for compromises.	0.8068818228786794
A compromise has now also been reached on the issue of asylum seekers.	0.5529343000376719
However, in this context, Madam President, to allow us to work out the details, I should like to request that the vote on the EQUAL report be held not tomorrow but on Wednesday.	0.9269994571469201
I believe that it is important for the Community initiative to be able to begin on time and therefore for the report to receive overwhelming support so that the Commission is also obliged to take into consideration the constructive proposals made by the European Parliament, because Parliament put the appropriations for EQUAL in the reserve precisely so as to ensure that Members' ideas were also reflected in this Community initiative.	0.9344294229192298
In this connection, the European Parliament is also justified in insisting that it should be possible to amend the thematic priorities only after a further hearing in Parliament.	0.7767025588680493
EQUAL should live up to its name, and this is my firm intention.	0.8378152754277995
It should provide equal opportunities for all those at a disadvantage in the European Union.	0.6788863363071285
It should prevent society from splintering.	0.3411311563705467
It should prevent exclusion from being part of everyday life.	0.4239426401924405
Everyone should be given the opportunity to benefit here from a common initiative regardless of their age, gender or origin.	0.6216254282755632
That is my intention and I would ask the House to give this report overwhelming support!	1.1096404021375665
Madam President, it is in itself an achievement that we are having this debate on the new URBAN Community initiative and it is an achievement that I am here tonight because Air France cancelled my flight at 2.10 p.m. but I am here!	1.0294150732462801
Just a year ago when the Commission produced its proposals around Agenda 2000 it axed the URBAN initiative.	0.5912935262982467
Yet we as politicians knew that there was a groundswell of support for continuing this initiative into the year 2000.	0.6379627571631067
Parliament, therefore, can take credit for a successful lobbying campaign to put URBAN back on the agenda and get the Commission and Council to make a U-turn.	0.9017235148813588
Urban policy has always been at the forefront of EU policy.	0.5153337095368966
In my Member State, for example, we are developing a strategic approach in a White Paper and an urban government taskforce is looking at the problems of urban communities.	0.7366873635744996
With eight out of ten people in Europe living in urban areas, it is right that we help our most deprived communities to tackle the all too familiar problems of deprivation, social exclusion, joblessness, crime, drug dependency and all the problems that are associated with that.	0.7359512871927216
For example, in my own region, in Manchester, the URBAN Community initiative has been a tremendous success.	1.1353165956016482
URBAN funds have been invested in one of the most deprived neighbourhoods in the UK, in Moss Side.	0.7872603145186436
The Millennium Youth Park project is helping to get young people re-engaged in regenerating their own community and in addition to support for small businesses and social policy we are beginning to see a turnaround of a very deprived urban community.	0.6409276918830106
The work of this URBAN agenda was then taken out to the wider community with an active communication and publicity campaign in local supermarkets and famous British pubs.	0.5379654853485648
This is the kind of good practice we would like to see extended across the EU in terms of communication and publicity.	0.8449786113531157
As regards the specific guidelines governing the initiative, they are broadly defined to give scope for local and regional diversity.	0.6703604568954035
We agree that they ought to be indicative in nature, allowing the maximum flexibility to ensure that we target specific programmes.	0.6512464284832988
In committee we are not in favour of reducing the number to 50.	0.8795442898314595
We are in favour of reduction overall but we believe that the arbitrary number of 50 is not the key factor.	0.7298449680562235
Instead, we should go for good-quality projects that can act as a catalyst to effect change and renewal, to attract inward investment in terms of loans and venture capital and to achieve a multiplier effect.	0.7451299036279663
The Member States should therefore be able to propose a reasonable number of areas within the financial ceiling of their allocations.	0.7755244545897391
In the designation of local URBAN programmes we need to make good use of local indicators and statistics on deprivation and health to enable us to more effectively target the most affected areas.	0.5900423186651972
In the UK the local index of deprivation is a very good example of a widely used standard and statistic to help determine not only EU but national and regional assistance programmes.	0.6264981596805843
This needs to be acknowledged as a tool and resource in addition to the EU criteria.	0.7321104299011307
I would ask you to take on board local indicators to help us do that.	0.7444355320217321
Our most deprived urban neighbourhoods face a plethora of problems: high unemployment and often very low-paid precarious employment, poverty and social exclusion.	0.5633447917335418
Often these problems are compounded by poor health and housing stock and a culture of drug dependency.	0.45301479090768054
We therefore have unstable communities which are infiltrated with crime, drug-dealing and gangs.	0.47612454341668925
This is all too familiar in many of our urban areas.	0.9514231158153154
All these complex problems undermine the quality of life for our urban residents, yet we have the potential in these areas to create growth and prosperity.	0.8363999734845599
That is why again, in my report, I have asked that action under the URBAN Programme should not merely provide a single solution to a single problem: these areas do not have single, "mono" problems.	1.0016518663155833
Instead, communities in urban areas should be encouraged to present integrated action plans to tackle their specific urban problems, using EU resources as a value added to local actions.	0.5949146234460853
I would like to see those actions extended to cover health and anti-discrimination, as provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty.	0.7646888330508699
The Community initiative means community involvement.	0.5588211380982387
Some of the most active and committed proponents and agents of change in our urban areas are local residents.	0.6750175177715182
We need to encourage them to participate in designing and delivering projects for these programmes.	0.581135797769538
The time-scale therefore proposed by the Commission is very ambitious.	0.9781075711778124
It is better to have quality projects with the active participation of community groups than to have projects delivered on time but without local participation.	0.5138115019472556
The Commission must of course provide full disclosure and transparency concerning the selection criteria used for the new urban initiatives but it must also disclose the consultancy networks which are being used to deliver the exchange of good practice.	0.7956377646838019
This is important in the interests of transparency and the overall effectiveness of networks.	0.8523281538632129
Finally, I should like to emphasise that in order to address the problems facing the post-industrial city we require local participation.	0.8053686737070479
We need to deploy the energies of the unemployed, the underused skills of youth and the experience of age to tackle these problems.	0.5625609950272753
We shall thereby be able to replace poverty, dependency and alienation with equity, initiative and participation.	0.3752666611776533
This will help us to restore the credibility of the EU and the confidence of citizens that Europe can deliver local action to solve local problems.	0.8060080349635312
. (IT) Mr President, as the rapporteur, Mrs McCarthy, has already pointed out, we can certainly consider URBAN a success for the European Parliament with regard to the debate held last year on the reform of the regulations.	1.0126567647972993
As we have heard, the objective of URBAN is the promotion of innovative strategies to promote economic and social regeneration in urban areas, bearing in mind that 80% of the population of Europe lives in cities.	0.8041132486903858
Creating a functioning urban environment in terms of social policy requires a policy of long-term job creation, action to combat poverty, measures to assist low-income groups and old people, facilities for children, racial and ethnic integration, better opportunities for participation, a targeted public health policy including measures to prevent drug abuse and concerted crime prevention measures.	0.6922658103806795
The Communication from the Commission takes account of the need to adopt approaches combining a range of economic, social, and infrastructural measures.	0.761660598770578
However, we must remember that, in addition to URBAN, a number of other Community instruments are also available in the social sector: innovative actions under Article 6 of the ESF regulation, pilot projects, particularly the new preparatory action for local commitment to employment that has just been introduced by the European Parliament under the 2000 budget and the EQUAL and INTERREG initiatives and mainstream ESF activities.	0.8424888356721434
As the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs stressed in its opinion, the Commission must therefore recognise the need to exploit synergies in this context while avoiding duplication of multiple funding.	0.9107328369460136
While, on the one hand, we believe that steering committees should ensure that the various projects are coherent and complementary, we would on the other hand urge the Commission to reinforce exchanges of information and coordination between the departments involved.	0.9152483688233342
Not only is this coordination essential but, as we stated in our opinion, exchanges and the dissemination of expertise and good practice must also be essential.	0.7316942758860588
Mr President, the importance of this initiative is increasing constantly as economic and social problems in Europe' s cities intensify and the public feels more and more out of touch with the administration of its city or neighbourhood.	0.7613063604196875
That situation will be compounded by social reclassifications resulting from European Union enlargement, and we must therefore make provision for the economic regeneration and social cohesion of our cities.	0.9331900274539503
Addressing those problems is all the more urgent in view of the marked spread of cities into the surrounding areas and in view of the cities' historical and cultural role.	0.678657168025004
However, in order for such an effort to succeed it is necessary to secure the commitment and participation of the public as a whole and to enlist the support of the less active social groups and the groups particularly affected by the economic and social crisis.	0.9574574007351259
Here, we wish to stress the need for the balanced involvement of women, and the agencies that represent them, in planning and implementing the URBAN initiative programmes.	1.053288544594639
As the Committee on Equal Opportunities, we also stress the need to finance infrastructures that will facilitate professional activity by women, mainly by harmonising their professional and family commitments, and more generally infrastructures that promote solidarity between the generations, social solidarity.	0.8873418240832694
Effective implementation of this initiative could have a cumulative result because it could inspire similar action at regional and local levels, thus increasing its political importance still further since women need to feel the effects of European policy in their day-to-day life in real terms.	0.7127451667477618
Mr President, our committee welcomed the priorities proposed by the Commission for the URBAN programme of better integration of local communities and ethnic minorities and improved security and crime prevention.	0.8430463455527578
In committee we thought that it was necessary for the economic and social regeneration of urban areas to go hand-in-hand with the creation of an atmosphere of tolerance towards minorities and therefore for measures designed to reduce racism and xenophobia to be an integral part of programmes to be funded by URBAN.	0.8459554121344334
We considered that increasing public confidence by combating everyday urban crime was one of the central tasks of urban regeneration.	0.5316708694163796
Our committee noted that innovative and effective action to combat and prevent crime at local level would require a whole array of measures including the incorporation of crime prevention in town planning, action to prevent juvenile delinquency, the reintegration of offenders, and models for effective local cooperation between the various parties involved, for example the police, the courts and social services.	0.7857347766700792
We adopted our recommendation unanimously in the committee because we felt that it was particularly important to continue URBAN - which in the past has been implemented successfully - because, as we see it, programmes of this kind are the only way in which we in the European Union will succeed in ensuring that in the long term all those who live in the European Union enjoy peaceful coexistence.	1.1026151936562985
For this reason we very much welcome programmes of this kind.	0.8399028313508793
I should like to comment on the concerns which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has with regard to the largest of the four Community initiatives, INTERREG III.	0.7534800431211873
It must also be possible to a considerable extent for social measures to receive support under INTERREG III.	0.5954346047497828
In the light of the fact that 50% of unemployment in the Union is essentially structural and given the particular sensitivity of the situation in the border regions - I need only refer to the possibility of unwelcome migration - this is not only reasonable but imperative.	0.9423961929023094
The measures eligible for funding listed in Annex II of strand A do also seem encouraging in this respect.	0.451659924809891
In reality, however, the Commission communication does not contain a single provision for the Member States with these integrated approaches for social and employment policy aspects.	0.8663695284228982
I should therefore like to draw your attention in particular to the inclusion of increased numbers of vocational training measures, especially in areas with high levels of long-term and youth unemployment.	0.6960256383024698
Employment policy measures should also be eligible for funding under strand B, especially for the applicant countries as part of the pre-accession strategy.	0.7751224301162273
In general where the employment policy measures are concerned it would seem to me to be necessary for appointments to the joint cooperation committee to be made on a regional basis - because the local expertise required for these specific purposes is only available at regional level - so as to avoid these measures becoming too abstract and therefore proving disappointing.	0.7616403620924211
The fact that administrative expenditure on INTERREG III is - in my opinion - still excessive is something which we can and indeed always must criticise, although it almost seems to me as though this is unavoidable with the Commission' s support programmes.	0.8942682175901695
However, I should like to point out that it is precisely here that this is fatal. It is precisely where employment policy is concerned that we should work towards measures which are as simplified as possible so that the social dimension of the EU is once again given the importance which it deserves.	1.0245985402292137
Mr President, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism considered, amongst other things, the report on LEADER+ and, as a result, agreed to support the process of decentralisation in the management of actions, believing that that process could be effective on two conditions: that local action groups represent the general interests of the local community, and that Commission control mechanisms are utilised to prevent local and regional political authorities from using LEADER+ resources to support civil groups and organisations which are related to those authorities.	0.7665499376978696
We ask for a guarantee that the decision-making bodies for the projects are represented equally by three elements: political representatives and public administrations, companies and economic operators, and social operators, including unions and non-governmental organisations.	0.7769415978644977
We would particularly like to stress that there must be balanced representation between men and women in all of these bodies.	0.7430512824770337
We would also like to stress that the main objective is the promotion of strategies for sustainable development, whose positive effects would extend to a broader geographical area than the local community itself, and we therefore feel it is appropriate for the projects to be integrated into the development programmes, included in Objectives 1 and 2, and into the regional planning of the regions and countries in which they are located.	0.9494553546859497
We are pleased that all the rural areas of the Union may be involved in LEADER+, but we believe that it is necessary to concentrate Community resources in the less-favoured regions in order to facilitate the process of socio-economic cohesion within the Union, and that state governments should not divert these resources towards objectives other than cohesion.	0.9365118911115612
The Committee believes that projects financed under action 1 should place value on the potential of endogenous development, in particular based on local traditions, techniques and practices, on specific production and on the management of sustainable energy.	0.7275873821097847
The Committee supports the Commission proposal to concentrate actions in small selected areas and believes that, given the dispersed nature of many rural inhabited locations, the minimum demographic ceiling for the selection of a project should be reduced to 10 000 inhabitants.	0.7365749566974625
We believe it is necessary to coordinate the development objectives and management mechanisms of actions 2 and 3, financed by LEADER, with those of other actions financed by other Community programmes relating to interregional and international cooperation and partnership, such as INTERREG, SAPAR, PHARE, TACIS and MEDA, in the same areas.	0.7679158807168117
Mr President, Mrs Stenzel, ladies and gentlemen, before addressing the EQUAL report itself, I should like to make a point of principle in connection with the employment guidelines on which the report is based.	0.8841249827468585
The basic objectives of an EU-wide employment policy are laid down in the guidelines and include employability, entrepreneurship and adaptability.	0.6546710214529737
These objectives are obviously intended to make employees as useful and usable as possible to the economy.	0.557950296458379
However, the aim of an approach which really sought to reduce discrimination effectively and in the long term would have to be people' s self-determination.	0.8406460126301812
Only then does it stop being a question of economic usability and start being about people having equal rights to shape their own lives.	0.4265718946303605
Mrs Stenzel' s report has, however, turned out very well, at least where the prescribed guidelines are concerned.	0.7138589906638815
All asylum seekers and refugees are to be included explicitly in the programmes, although this should be self-evident.	0.8977337838240319
Nevertheless the Conservatives voted against this in the committee.	0.7750776897605044
I would ask them the following questions: does your policy seek to marginalise people?	0.6258284034419633
What is the idea behind preventing people from working when they wish to do so?	0.808236182035508
Does this not stand in stark contradiction to the guideline on employability?	0.37592352425095055
It is also worth mentioning that this is a mainstreaming programme, because there remains a shortcoming in the report.	0.9289119225771842
Particular emphasis is given to the point that women' s opportunities on the labour market ought to be improved and that to achieve this more crèches should be built.	0.7486643165243695
Anyone who lets men happily climb the career ladder and worries only about childcare places without fighting against the way in which the work of reproduction is shared out unevenly has not - and unfortunately that includes women - understood the concept of mainstreaming!	0.5828814598284956
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism adopted this opinion on the EQUAL report at its concluding discussion with no votes against and one abstention.	0.617682048738999
I am deliberately stating this at the beginning of my intervention to make it clear that there is in fact an alternative view to that of the committee responsible, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.	0.9861072627709816
This cross-group support for the opinion is explained by the conclusions, which are devoted to the question of how issues related to regional policy, transport and tourism can be combined with action to combat all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market.	0.7592852243543138
The members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of course also identify a number of areas of the Commission proposal which they would criticise: firstly, for example, the insufficient thematic guidelines laid down for the development partnership activities; secondly, the fact that strict selection criteria for evaluating the project proposals will only be drawn up only at a later stage by the Commission and thirdly, the fear of excessive administrative and technical expenditure on project management by the Commission and the technical assistance bodies.	0.8424009396656739
That is why a ceiling needs to be set for administrative expenditure.	0.8813021304414466
The committee based its conclusions on these critical comments.	0.33299987549890403
We attached particular importance to linking the creation of new jobs for disadvantaged and excluded people in the social sector, in tourism and in small and medium-sized enterprises with promoting the establishment of new small and medium-sized businesses bearing in mind the necessary economic structural change.	0.8078134821514085
Dovetailing the activities under the Community initiative with the European employment initiatives is an essential requirement and a crucial prerequisite for attaining the objectives of the EQUAL programme.	0.8337659537631188
We fully support the innovative approach towards setting up development partnerships and organising the exchange of experience at European level as an integral part of the EQUAL programme.	0.6373476579041334
The specific target of deriving European added value brings the regional cooperation up to European level while retaining the cooperation of the various regional operators.	0.5696389050999688
This is a good approach and that is why we have also supported it.	1.1614093759507922
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, who have managed to produce excellent reports in just a short time.	0.684891016745474
However, criticism has been voiced within my group over the timing of the preparatory work of the committee.	0.7850068190287925
The reports are late, and, in addition, they were very hastily discussed by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.	0.8335349755465365
A good opportunity to discuss the results, good practices and shortcomings of the earlier programmes was therefore lost.	0.6184648130708528
Our group is keen to stress the importance of cross-border activity under the INTERREG programme and especially cooperation focusing on areas outside the European Union.	0.6460941118495249
Such important areas include the Balkans and the Adriatic region, but, in my opinion, we should not ignore cooperation with Russia either.	0.9059356002932945
Our group would once again like to raise the issue of the practical monitoring of funds and emphasise the importance of better coordination of the INTERREG, TACIS, ISPA and PHARE programmes.	0.7671413119687148
This coordination is at present lacking, and the Commission has not as yet made any precise proposals to improve it.	0.9937503423487206
We here in Parliament are waiting for the Commission to give the committee a more detailed explanation of the issue as soon as possible.	0.8647212847095781
It is of decisive importance to get local business, organisations and other players involved in the practical implementation of programmes.	0.6227394320839664
Experience shows that projects of cooperation need better planning and closer monitoring and need to be generally more successful.	0.452069820001368
Projects have often remained half-finished, and their efficiency has been drained by administration and bureaucracy.	0.6176995264018563
We also have to demand that our partners in cooperation be committed to projects and fulfil their share of the agreement.	0.6683395722566314
Our group is reviewing a few amendments that were rejected by the committee.	0.7259232751317101
I would like to mention here again the URBAN report, in which the rapporteur, in the explanatory statements, has dealt admirably with the issue of the minimum sum of EUR 500 per inhabitant as per the Commission' s guidelines.	0.9464787730679534
It will not work as an automatic target, but must be applied in the target area according to prevailing conditions.	0.8718924318184433
This is such an important matter for consideration that firm conclusions have to drawn.	0.6213045203338405
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, INTERREG is one of the most European of all the Structural Funds.	0.7254645989557749
Here, projects covering only one region or one country will not receive support; they will have to cover neighbouring regions in two or more countries.	0.7055545677091656
Unfortunately this is only true for part of the money, that is only for the borders within the EU.	0.9437978958952516
But it is precisely the regions on borders with third countries which need an operational instrument to foster cross-border cooperation.	0.7134823744683179
The regulation pretends that there is one, but there is not.	1.090756798816245
The fact is that the Commission has not amended the regulation for years, although Parliament has been calling for it to do so for some time.	1.0469024699311271
The practical consequence for these regions in the immediate future is that support for border areas will again be downgraded.	0.6044563991956506
Since 1996, Parliament has been calling for a joint fund to be created for cooperation with third countries in order to resolve difficulties.	0.8791189968126889
Nothing has happened!	0.1409842860704703
The difficulties are once again being allowed to persist, to the detriment of the regions concerned.	0.7816041793085813
Parliament is here renewing its call for an improvement and for cross-border cooperation, and we look forward to a joint fund being created and to the regulation being amended once more in cooperation with the other Commissioners.	0.8469166154598416
We want a Europe for the people and not a Europe of paper-pushers!	1.0711086802339893
Mr President, a third of EU money is invested in funds for all kinds of development causes.	0.7099999246815228
According to my group, this is excellent if, as a result of this, deprivation within regions, towns and population groups is eliminated or if health and the environment improved.	0.7422709510308088
That is a question of solidarity and progress.	0.8456268995858305
But dishing out increasing amounts of money is no guarantee for improved spending.	0.4952823384272206
The local councils and regions where the money ends up have since gained practical experience.	0.4954601058803696
They find it is extremely difficult to spend the money on their most needy causes.	0.6055222856236678
Anything related to economic growth and infrastructure usually scores quite highly, but social goals and environmental causes often cannot count on approval.	0.5529142596377246
Since there is great uncertainty surrounding the way in which rules are interpreted, local councils and regions have now started to enlist the services of expensive bureaux. The task of these experts is to gauge to what extent European Commission officials would be prepared to approve plans.	0.6572104163411452
In some cases, I get the impression that it is not about solidarity or alleviating the most desperate problems, but about propaganda and upholding vested interests in exchange for the European Union' s blessing.	0.8038052893764587
It seems that the key goal there has become the construction and painting of propaganda panels advertising the fact that such and such a project has been co-financed by the European Union.	0.640761734066496
Too much money is wasted on propaganda and investigation bureaux, consultation and control, and a great deal of money ends up back in the country where it was collected in the first place.	0.7981685222783927
After the planned accession of new Member States with their 100 million inhabitants, the prosperity level of which is at one third or two thirds of the average level of the current EU Member States, this squandering will generate even more protest.	0.7952311315616603
In the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the Confederal Group of the European United Left was in agreement with the draftsman of the opinion, Mr Nogueira Román, on LEADER.	0.8611874147655326
He was right to point out that it is not a good idea to share out this funding between all rural areas.	0.894661032352865
If there is a choice between investing in innovation projects or injecting most of the funding into bringing on deprived areas, we would opt for the latter as this does the most to benefit equality.	0.7126273445539741
After all, innovation in areas that have already grown prosperous is paying dividends even now and taking place without European funding.	0.5455007648373663
A second point where we need to focus our attention is the possibility of nepotism and abuse of power within regional and local councils.	0.7038400226887569
The emphasis is on local groups in which the authorities, non-profit-making organisations and profit-making companies join forces.	0.5575647240738528
The discussion has centred on the allocation formula to be applied.	0.4306421895518336
In this respect, one of the variants considered is reminiscent of the Dutch polder model, the structurally planned cooperation between government, trade unions and employers' organisations.	0.6534349007353829
Let us not forget that elections for local councils and regional parliaments are held so as to represent the entire population.	0.5910800506990161
So, really, these bodies should already provide for a balance, and take into account the wishes of the union movement and environmental movement in the process.	0.8727704648829088
My group welcomes the fact that the union movement and environmental movement are expressly given their own roles to play, as their input in society is important in our view.	0.8344843747371572
This could prevent local governments that are functioning in a short-sighted or insufficiently democratic way from neglecting their duty of input from the very start.	0.5540595830679406
But the fact that we now fear abuse of power and nepotism indicates that, unfortunately, democracy is not fully functioning yet.	0.7823819253021006
One of the objections is that, due to the restricted role of the elected bodies, businesses gain more influence.	0.6781953685184697
As long as the economy does not weigh up the needs of all in a democratic way but is more concerned with making a profit for the benefit of a few, it is questionable as to whether democracy functions better under the rule of employers than under the rule of local councils.	0.6994412659063977
We believe in 'one man, one vote' more than 'one share, one vote' .	0.7127258046569397
Mr President, there are economic frontiers within the European Union, and the internal market with the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is fully operating at this time.	0.7900319360759629
But for the internal market to work effectively and for the single European currency to be a success it is important that all regions within Europe, of which there are over 100, can economically compete within this very challenging environment.	0.9853843211233965
Some areas within the European Union are economically very strong and heavily exceed the average income per capita.	0.6513387264280087
There are poor regions within the Union which need to be given European assistance to improve the fabric of their economies so that they can compete within the European Union structure.	0.8311367563516865
That is why, when we look at the EU Financial Perspective between 1989 and 1993, and 1994 and 1999, we find such a large proportion of the EU budget was put aside for the administration of the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund.	1.05699199500158
There are twin problems that still remain for many regions in Europe: firstly, the lack of adequate infrastructure in terms of road, water treatment facilities and related transport networks; secondly, the need to put in place initiatives to combat youth and long-term unemployment, which is a constant social problem in many urban and rural parts of Europe.	0.714256771283225
There must always be a commitment to ensuring that we do not only build a Europe of the cities alone.	0.8313310003014067
We need to ensure that job creation initiatives are in place to promote employment opportunities in the small- and medium-sized enterprise sector in rural parts of Europe as well.	0.8196645921279763
The core aspects of this debate this evening relate to the operation of the EU initiative programmes, namely, the new INTERREG III initiative, EQUAL and the LEADER+ scheme.	0.9169105979987607
Between these three programmes there must be a clear demonstration of the commitment of the EU to promoting cross-border development, combating the problems of long-term unemployment and supporting rural development schemes.	0.9018613849092083
Mr President, quite a few towns and cities within the European Union have to contend with deprivation.	0.7967513103833115
The Member States do not always have sufficient means at their disposal to address this deprivation adequately.	0.6671232116154849
This is why it is useful for the European Union to continue to support the Member States and, if necessary, give additional support under URBAN.	1.0750969578556961
Over the next seven years, the Commission' s proposals concerning URBAN will entail a reduction in both the Community budget and the number of areas standing to benefit.	0.8490587481772219
In common with Mrs McCarthy, I have to note that the number of areas has been drastically reduced.	0.9143108825546689
It is desirable for Member States to have a certain amount of freedom to determine the number of projects themselves within the confines of a certain budget.	0.7369799029135772
As far as the budget is concerned, as already stated, URBAN is there to support and complement national policy.	0.8851111108030488
In order to generate extra means if necessary, I think it is entirely logical to turn first to the Member States and private investors.	0.7950726939113498
Consequently, we cannot support Amendment No 2 of the Greens, as borne out in the committee meeting.	1.234402567302912
In addition, I am of the opinion that funding for a town or neighbourhood, especially where Community contributions are concerned, should incentivise.	0.8574322729902367
Structural support is said to cause subsidy-dependence.	0.37577406025863025
We would then be overreaching ourselves.	0.49505051121200205
I would like to finish off by making a general comment on INTERREG.	0.5290111286122225
In my opinion, funding for cross-border initiatives should only be provided if it is actually required by the regions.	0.6242335867581607
When projects are implemented, it is also important that they do not contravene general Community legislation.	0.7699051654823892
According to the report issued by the Court of Auditors on the year 1998, this is not an imagined risk.	0.9967500693893975
Hence our amendment in order to prevent contradictions between general policy and actual projects.	0.5298809384777655
Before I begin I will take the liberty of expressing my consternation at the way in which Austria has been prejudged by 14 Council representatives.	0.5153654240307607
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as part of the reform of the Structural Funds the Community initiatives are being pruned to a total of four.	0.7589068736156919
I welcome the continuation of INTERREG and the priority which it has been accorded.	0.7678296434317728
However, the delayed presentation of the draft guidelines has caused a number of problems.	0.8491111603035991
The regions have not been sufficiently involved in the preparation of the guidelines, although this demand was often made in the debate about the reform of the Structural Funds.	0.9690949288001596
There is no direct transition between INTERREG II and III, the practical consequences of which are uncertainty in terms of planning and gaps in funding.	0.6615246274429724
That is a shame because it threatens perfectly sensible projects.	0.5286635558479374
When INTERREG is implemented, it will need to be coordinated and synchronised with the other financial instruments concerned.	0.7946533190379276
This is particularly important in order to increase the efficiency of the funds deployed.	0.8138570536280871
However, problems will arise in particular from the fact that under PHARE, for example, funds are managed on an annual basis and allocation of appropriations is project-related, whereas INTERREG funds are multiannual and are allocated on a measures-related basis.	0.5917066239204406
This will cause practical problems in the future, and I hope that despite this it will be possible to implement INTERREG effectively.	0.85554951955793
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Community initiative LEADER proved itself to be an effective instrument to initiate innovative developments and pilot projects both within and outside rural areas.	0.7418039412875984
The preservation of this Community initiative in particular, in the form of a new version - LEADER+ - is therefore greatly to be welcomed.	1.0026749489909286
The new LEADER+ programme now covers all rural areas in the European Union, which will open up greater possibilities for potential projects.	0.7241547319614747
It is important for there to be coordination between LEADER+ and the other support initiatives in the European Union, but coordination with other national support schemes is also just as important.	0.8436947088934362
Overlap between support schemes must be avoided and at the same time it must also be possible to exploit any synergistic effects.	0.6911273420241502
In this context the aim of stepping up networking between eligible zones under LEADER is very welcome.	0.6025752182086228
Agriculture is one of the cornerstones of the rural environment and it must be possible for it to have a part in the LEADER initiative.	0.9698614344559543
In the same way, through the LEADER initiative, structural change in agriculture can be supported by creating new jobs in rural areas.	0.7991471780736531
Attention must be paid in the LEADER+ programme to all the sectors of the economy in rural areas; only a combined effort will reap an optimal result.	0.774672000035257
LEADER must now move into the implementation phase.	0.3804581579869025
The operational programmes need to be approved as quickly as possible by the Commission, which implies practical and efficient administration of applications and completion of the application approval process as quickly as possible.	0.7307000105039632
Five months are provided for this.	0.288808674522059
That seems to me to be rather too long.	0.5677248840010911
Efforts should be made here to achieve shorter times.	0.5577497723770499
Because anyone who develops a project and has it ready will also want to start implementing it as soon as possible.	0.4527809790209544
Despite all the delight over the reworking of this Community initiative LEADER+, I do still have one further concern.	0.7838773914781377
In its proposal the Commission called for an observatory for the LEADER+ programme without going into detail on how this proposal would be implemented.	0.5936176425469059
For me this raises the following questions: who will work there?	0.6049260715216599
How will these people be selected?	0.2605124813370804
Where, above all, will the required money come from, and where should this observatory be located?	0.779528070456176
I do think, though, that the LEADER+ programme has not got a penny to spare on additional administrative tasks, which in the normal course of events would have to be carried out by the Commission in any case.	0.9871454246765416
In addition, experience from other fields where observatories have been set up shows that, apart from rather dubiously creating jobs, they are not of any great benefit.	0.6205746238785333
I would therefore call on the Commission to fulfil its monitoring duties directly itself and to do all it can to ensure that LEADER+ programmes run smoothly.	0.800690582235151
Assessment and publication are part of this, and it has of course assumed responsibility for these in the past.	0.865794888644988
Mr President, the majority of the borders, which have divided Europe for centuries, were artificially created, separating single geographic spaces and creating serious disparities in terms of balanced development and cohesion.	0.7500715122167232
Our internal borders, or what remains of them, no longer cause wars, but they do continue to generate economic backwardness, social barriers and a lack of cultural communication between the peoples of Europe.	0.8227282555799181
The Community' s institutions are obliged to work towards overcoming these border scars, which contradict the spirit of European unity.	0.7156043459336622
The economic and social cohesion which we propose is based, by means of the INTERREG initiative, on territorial cohesion and on the integration of border areas and the outermost regions of our continent.	0.9388271108858764
INTERREG has always been at the heart of a genuine Community policy for regional planning and a truly polycentric notion of our European territory.	0.6123390035704118
Although the European Parliament supports this initiative, our only regret is that we have to approve a resolution on it before we have seen any evaluation of INTERREG II.	0.9974106609392903
However, we are aware that we must not delay this third version further, since otherwise we would be jeopardising the success of various projects and the continuity of the projects which are currently underway. The success of INTERREG is clear and that is the opinion of the local, regional and national authorities which have participated in the cofinanced projects.	0.9682192434549158
The people who have participated in this initiative have learnt the importance of learning together, of innovation, of sharing projects and good practices and of understanding and tolerating each other.	0.7933440060216389
There are many interesting questions relating to it, the monitoring centre, the principle of concentration etc. However, I would like to concentrate on the management bodies.	0.8169705805156532
We must create joint, interregional and transnational management bodies, in which all local and regional authorities, as well as economic and social operators, play an active role.	0.9190069084151017
There must not be any repetition of cases of parallel projects on both sides of a border.	0.6455764966095942
We must create a cross-border culture, and to this end we must be innovative with regard to administrative cooperation, imaginatively overcoming existing barriers and overcoming the difficulties posed by the differing levels of competence in each Member State, in each region and each municipality.	0.7936098093264545
A project must never fail to be implemented as a result of difficulties in communication.	0.5933292125337878
During debates in committee, we have also pointed out the difficulties involved in coordinating INTERREG with other annual or biannual financial instruments, such as MEDA, TACIS or PHARE.	0.6677297359720317
This Parliament' s motion for a resolution has been very attentive to these difficulties, making proposals capable of solving them to the Commission and setting reasonable deadlines for making the necessary changes.	0.8035147537630406
Mr President, my reason for wanting to contribute to this debate is because the URBAN initiative, in Ireland in particular, has been quite successful and I am keen that the European Union make a further contribution in that area.	1.045097185652895
It is a sad fact that there are many hundreds, if not thousands, of communities in the European Union suffering very severe poverty and disadvantage.	0.974494762854449
Even in Member States and cities that are extremely wealthy we have large numbers of people living in ghettos, in situations where there are inadequate facilities, where schooling is very poor, where the physical infrastructure is under-developed and where drugs and other phenomena are rife.	0.7730470863904065
It seems to me that in order for the European Union to demonstrate that it has a role in helping the citizens of the European Union it must give assistance to Member States to demonstrate that the Union works for these citizens and their families.	1.0523451367074865
The programme has been extremely successful in Ireland, as indeed I know it has been successful in other countries.	0.8859871232850598
It was quite slow in getting off the ground there, but it was slow because it was necessary to have the local people themselves develop these programmes.	0.9120416909848064
It is important that they use their initiative and their own local expertise in developing this initiative.	0.6791938156536518
It would be very easy to have these programmes developed quickly and on time if you brought in outside professional experts but that would undermine the whole purpose of the URBAN programme.	0.6345372453353377
I should like to make one further point before I conclude: we should insist where this money is being allocated and where this programme is being developed that it be done in the context of a serious URBAN development policy.	0.8381005521512586
This, unfortunately, is not the case in Ireland.	1.184548913231512
I applaud the innovative approach of the EQUAL programme and the aim of integrating discriminated groups into the labour market.	0.7041812808442116
The development partnerships are a very clever idea, even though they are experimental.	0.7823882320045302
I have two major concerns, however, about the development partnerships.	0.902815919070478
They should be accessible to smaller groups, accessible for them to be able to devise, implement and monitor the programmes.	0.5661009350431229
We need to have a wide element of flexibility within the programme.	0.6466075612318711
I have also expressed concern in the past about the use of simple language and not using jargon, so that it becomes accessible to everyone.	0.7923985205596367
I am glad to see that this was accepted into the report, but I cannot agree with Amendment No 9 because that amendment really is not expressed in simple language at all.	0.7731373787100071
My second concern was that some discriminated groups have specific problems, for example, disabled people' s access to the workplace.	0.5380527539619545
Projects should also specifically address this problem.	0.38098869266182567
These concerns must be looked at while setting up the programmes.	0.478403150319678
I certainly intend to do that with organisations and groups in my constituency in the West Midlands.	0.6793773116692656
I now turn to the controversial issue of asylum-seekers and refugees.	0.45610203100073393
Although I am not in favour of those refugees who have been refused refugee status and threatened with repatriation, having access to EQUAL, I would support the possibility of access for all other asylum-seekers and refugees.	0.7702981849174211
It is only fair and right for them to be able to access EQUAL in the same way as everyone else.	0.7725710707563372
Thank you, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, with the LEADER report, rural development is very much to the fore.	0.973047591362909
This does not happen all that often and it is gratifying, especially as the LEADER programmes have been key elements in the Union' s rural development policy.	0.7713974183346167
It must be pointed out that these programmes have not only been instrumental in structuring regional planning, but have also been vital instruments for economic and social cohesion in often vulnerable areas such as, for example, areas experiencing depopulation.	0.7692239200517357
It must be stressed that in order to become eligible under the LEADER programme, local operators have combined forces, debated and prepared projects.	0.6488243989480148
These programmes have, therefore, been important channels for participative democracy, the rationale of the citizen for Europe.	0.7635599414209633
So, the concept for LEADER+ should retain all the positive aspects of previous programmes.	0.6708765584500287
One urgent question is therefore raised: why, when this programme has been successfully run for ten years, is LEADER+ still classed as experimental?	0.7802909044072035
Are there so many other European schemes which can boast 800 specific original experiments which were particularly successful?	0.4339036379928298
For how much longer is the Commission going to leave LEADER at the experimental stage instead of bringing it online as part of the general concept of mainstreaming of rural development?	0.6581918641293908
Moreover, I wonder at the reduced guidelines to which the Commission wishes to restrict LEADER+.	0.8897254019420203
At a time when, Commissioner, after Seattle, we Europeans are fighting on the grounds of multifunctionality in rural development projects, why should we confine ourselves to a few limited criteria with resources that are far from sufficient?	0.797593894654112
As an ecologist, let met tell you that the precautionary principle and sustainable development require much more diversified and many-sided approaches.	0.6270231912245886
In this connection, the Commission is proposing to limit yet further the cooperation actions of local action groups to only candidate countries.	0.7449959355099254
A better solution would be, as indeed the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism suggests, strengthened coordination between LEADER+ and the Community cooperation and partnership programmes, such as INTERREG, PHARE, SAPARD or MEDA.	0.6440190966226705
The fact is, showing solidarity with Eastern Europe, is all very well, but it is not enough.	0.903588345002328
The tradition which has already been established by the previous programmes with the countries of the south, particularly the countries around the Mediterranean, must not be abandoned.	0.9444513148691464
Therefore, once more, we can stress that what the area of agriculture and rural development really needs is codecision. Codecision would give us effective means to progress programmes of this type, which require cooperation and cross-disciplinary application.	0.8684434828693551
Mr President, I have a few very brief comments.	1.0395510036067948
We are debating the planning phase and guidelines for the four Community initiatives without access to any substantive and complete appraisal of the previous period. This is not very good at all.	0.8963095755852337
Programmes and objectives usually turn out to be far too ambitious and their results are not always satisfactory, while the lack of transparency and complexity of the plans often allow considerable scope for mismanagement and even fraud.	0.6468506207438811
The Community initiatives we are debating could play a positive part subject to certain preconditions.	0.6801523637264951
They must, however, not be subordinated to the objectives and aspirations of a more generally negative economic and social policy, but must develop their own self-sufficient role.	0.9095821620793042
For example, adapting EQUAL to the objectives of employability and the flexibilisation of labour relations transforms this initiative into a new version of local employment contracts.	0.5585148417389229
Extending the LEADER initiative to every area in the Union entails the risk of marginalising deprived areas even more, to the benefit of more developed areas.	0.7775962113480263
The INTERREG initiative must include eligible areas with special emphasis on border areas, islands and both mountain and non-mountain areas, such as the prefecture of Arta in Greece, whose omission from Annex I of the Commission' s communication is ill-considered.	0.58595451770021
Mr President, rural development has been identified by this Parliament and the Commission as a priority policy area, and I would like to welcome here today the Commissioner responsible, Commissioner Fischler.	1.1113895188279124
Our response to rural decline has come late in the day, but I suppose better late than never.	0.6930542102632563
Family farming is now recognised as central to the European agricultural model and is an objective to be addressed, certainly within the time-scale of Agenda 2000.	0.8013103169861231
In my view the next five years will decide the future of thousands of marginal family farms.	0.7821405543241734
It behoves all of us to do everything possible to ensure their survival.	0.6397049804117032
As the Commissioner knows, farming alone will not be sufficient to ensure the sustainability of rural communities.	0.804235857860942
For this reason we need the coordination of all policy areas capable of impacting positively on rural development.	0.7588222212246535
In this regard LEADER has established itself as an effective development initiative.	0.600706885629156
It provides the opportunity for local communities to identify their development potential and become actively involved in addressing those problems.	0.5459918319419935
The voluntary participation of people in development programmes is something that is not always fully appreciated.	0.8807204330835459
Yet, through LEADER, there can be no doubting its effectiveness as an integral part of broader EU and national policy.	0.7410976073655191
In conclusion, while welcoming Commission approval for LEADER+, I am concerned about the time delay between the ending of LEADER II and the commencement of the new programme.	0.8936941560697327
I urge you to look seriously at this problem.	0.43522044199590504
A break in continuity will have serious consequences for the programme and certainly a disruptive effect on voluntary and professional workers.	0.5464627472585821
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having read the Commission communication on the INTERREG III initiative, and pointing out that I took part in the vote on Mr Decourrière' s report within the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I should like not only to expressly reiterate our agreement in principle with the initiative as presented and, particularly in the context of INTERREG III B, with the Commission' s recognition of activities contributing to the restoration of landscapes run down due the level of prices in the agricultural sector, a sector in which many associations, especially cynegetic, are already making enormous investments in my own country.	0.8055029360971198
I should also like to give my considered support to the comments of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, particularly and primarily in deploring the failure to integrate the most remote regions into strand A of the programme or in commenting upon the lack of precision in the selection criteria for the implementation methods for strand III C and, finally, in requesting that Members of the European Parliament should be involved in the European Observatory for cross-border, transregional and interregional cooperation.	0.8196623736602562
I should further like to express major reservations with regard to the exaggerated tendency which, in the Commission communication with reference to INTERREG III and III B, involves associating environmental protection exclusively with the development of Natura 2000, which I think is often an excessively abstract means of safeguarding ecosystems, from which users are in danger of being excluded or severely restricted.	0.8161383659557582
Finally, if the Commission and the relevant Councils of Ministers permit, I should like to stress that the Members of the European Parliament should be given more information on the procedures relating to the implementation of the INTERREG projects and, beyond that, of similar initiatives.	1.128972403951728
It would be even better if they were involved to a greater extent in the processes of framing and implementing the programmes concerned, otherwise it will be difficult to determine and defend their role in relation to the local and national authorities and even the citizens.	0.8231267853423301
Mr President, first of all, I would like thank the rapporteur of the EQUAL report, Mrs Stenzel, very warmly for all the efforts she has made to master this very complex subject matter on behalf of all of us.	0.9573138769808746
EQUAL is a very difficult programme because it attempts to combine so many old programmes and yet aims to view them in a different light, doing so with less money than was available in the previous funds.	0.6584866053760241
This is an arduous task.	0.7519892300484973
Only, the number of people affected by these programmes has not really dropped.	0.8344885437082836
This is why it is so hard to strike a balance, not only between the different countries or the different components, but especially between the different groups listed in the programme, and in fact this is what has preoccupied us to date.	1.054352386873128
Comments are made here and there to the effect that one group should get more funding than another.	0.5311954769127878
I, for my part, have focused on the position of the handicapped and the elderly within the framework of the programme, and I have to say that their position could well have been overlooked altogether if it had not been for the European Parliament devoting special attention to them.	0.972720005363065
Although a few other groups have been mentioned, it is the Member States, in particular, which are on the lookout.	0.9586391668707791
For example, I know of one Member State that would like to use a large proportion of the entire programme for one component, namely refugees.	0.953233899569802
I would, therefore, ask the Commissioner to ensure that a balance is struck between these different groups.	0.6477581477710411
It should not be the case that one Member State, under the pretext of calling on the subsidiarity principle, can decide that all funding should go to one group.	0.8229309777462624
I think that this will have to be monitored closely because otherwise we will end up in that situation against which Mr Meijer has warned us so vehemently, to wit, that vested interests will emerge and that people will think that the money is theirs to spend.	0.8671915749285274
This is not the case!	0.9450166546183464
It has to be redistributed time and again.	0.5525216328624265
It should be used for innovative projects and it should not completely disappear into the Finance Minister' s treasury funds.	0.7694357084840378
That is not the intention and that is an important point that we need to bear in mind here.	1.219624062626135
I believe that the remaining problems that we have faced within this Parliament, and which in large part stem from the fact that it is so difficult to strike the right balance, can be solved.	1.0014278931816887
As far as the Commission is concerned, I hope it will be able to join in the compromise that is being concluded here in this Parliament, mainly with a view to reaching a balance.	0.9493317411901031
I would just like to underline this - the situation is, of course, a little precarious - Parliament has, for the sake of convenience and safety, placed the EQUAL programme on the back burner for the time being, so that Parliament has yet to be persuaded of the way the funds are to be distributed.	0.9344272933793017
I believe that this is actually a good thing.	1.071394868198745
The position of Parliament in this whole procedure is somewhat unclear.	0.7531588280595929
The Rules of Procedure do not shed any more light on the matter and that is exactly why this back burner is extremely useful.	0.6918253432196073
Mr President, there is no doubt that the INTERREG initiative promotes efforts to achieve economic and social cohesion in the European Union.	0.9067275020993338
However, I should like to stress INTERREG' s particular importance for the Balkan area, where political developments and hostilities over the past few years have had major economic repercussions for neighbouring countries and especially for my own country, Greece, which is the only Member State on that long-suffering peninsula.	0.827337210933602
For Greece, for the neighbouring countries Italy and Austria, but also for Europe as a whole, the social and economic restoration of the Balkans, bringing political stability, is a vitally important matter.	0.9849136051451916
So far, some Balkan countries have received aid from the PHARE and Obnova programmes, while others have not.	0.7066829840065381
During the new programme period, in view of enlargement and bearing in mind that funding has been provided for from new financial instruments and regulations, such as ISPA and Sapard, it is considered absolutely essential to coordinate the funding of all three strands of INTERREG with other financial aid to third countries.	0.7618502719964513
Accordingly, we welcome the related references in Chapter 7 of the European Commission' s proposed general guidelines for INTERREG.	0.884054285002071
The efforts to coordinate the planning and so make it more effective must extend to all the programmes equally, and I say that because in the MEDA programme during the last period some problems arose which have to be overcome, so that we can have equal treatment for all the third countries participating in that programme.	0.9252432100778007
I should like to end by saying that the planning of the new inter-state cooperation zones has taken no account of the Mediterranean' s geographical peculiarities, which would justify the creation of a special zone for coastal and island regions.	0.8432407896499916
We therefore ask the Commission to pay special attention to the issue of maritime and island cooperation when zone planning next comes up for review.	0.693432869832203
I end by stressing the need for the European Union to persist with such initiatives, which strive to eliminate inequalities between our regions, and to foster their harmonious development.	0.9714108155861036
And since this is St. Valentine' s day, as a former Mayor of a regional city, I propose that we should all declare our love for all the European regions which need that love.	1.0320019164528818
Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, rural development can and must tackle the problem from three different angles: preservation of jobs, stewardship of the countryside and, not least, local culture, because that is of the utmost importance.	0.942057504155082
Only if the population can stay in the countryside will the quality of life in the countryside also be permanently assured.	0.7678171982652983
We can observe the consequences of migration from the countryside in several areas of the Alps and they are devastating.	0.659859514853954
But I warn against using these programmes to take urban culture to the countryside.	0.3983460380977328
And neither should we create structures which are reliant on subsidies and which will be dependent on them forevermore.	0.5864006763911094
To really guarantee sustainability - a buzzword which has, since it gained new currency, become relatively devoid of meaning, but we all know what we mean by it - what is needed, amongst other things, is an integrated approach in the countryside towards, for example, tourism and agriculture.	0.9131179587007646
The investment needs to be visionary.	0.40670825547042816
Young, creative individuals must be made to feel an attachment to the countryside. If they all leave then nothing much will go on there any more.	0.7132940049021246
None of us think much of the principle of indiscriminate, all-round distribution, and the pilot projects need to act, as it were, like avalanches and trigger other similar projects.	0.788863394168934
I would be in favour of supporting self-contained cycles of projects and, even though LEADER I and LEADER II may have had shortcomings here and there, overall they were certainly positive.	0.6913719041125702
I should like to ask that we consider granting derogations not only in the Nordic countries but also for mountainous areas - the Alps, the Pyrenees and the Sierra Nevada, from where I have just returned - in respect of population size and density.	0.8911169117541234
Mr President, I want to talk about the EQUAL report, especially the issue of the policy on refugees.	1.1216289037289153
Last week, we had a very impassioned discussion about the formation of the Austrian Government.	1.017009833101972
Today, we are already discussing the Austrian coalition government' s policy on refugees because Mrs Stenzel, who is the author of the EQUAL report, of course represents Austria' s governing conservative party and its policy.	0.8946333710355215
The most startling aspect of her original report was that she wanted to limit aid to the small group of refugees covered by the Geneva Convention, that is to say so-called quota refugees or UN refugees.	0.716349518846839
In actual fact, it is the other refugees, namely those outside the quota and those not covered by UN aid, who need aid the most.	0.7964292451627673
The Committee rejected this discriminatory proposal and decided that all refugees should have a place on the EQUAL programme on identical conditions.	0.6396981084174084
Some members of the Committee, however, supported Mrs Stenzel' s proposal and wordings.	0.8513172223454659
As I see it, this means that Mr Haider' s politics are already casting their shadow over this Parliament.	0.5847754060146473
It is therefore crucially important that the Chamber should be as emphatic as it possibly can be in establishing the fact that all refugees are to have a place on the EQUAL programme.	0.9066661837156582
I want, finally, to say that I had certain misgivings last week when we discussed the formation of the Austrian Government but, when it comes to discussing and criticising its policy on refugees, I have no misgivings.	0.9249116028294483
I hope that the Chamber will be just as committed this time.	0.7385638320551919
Mr President, during the last EU Financial Perspective from 1994 to 1999, when there were 13 different initiatives in operation, the INTERREG II cross-border programme was an important initiative.	0.8222548335246767
The fact that the next round of Structural Funds 2000-2006 includes the INTERREG initiative is I believe, a very clear indication of the importance which is attached to it by national EU Member States.	0.9111022668371234
The INTERREG I programme between 1989 and 1993 and the INTERREG II programme between 1994 and 1999 have proved an absolute success in terms of bridging closer social and economic development between bordering Member States.	0.5242803277150175
Coming from the border counties in the north-west of Ireland, I have seen over the years the important role which INTERREG I and II have played and I am delighted to welcome INTERREG III.	0.9054423402854627
The Commission is allocating 67 million pounds towards the INTERREG III programme, which will be spent on continuing the development of cross-border economic projects between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.	0.7766386851683815
The European Union has played a key role in developing the border county region in Ireland over the years.	0.741255895452545
The European Union is the single largest contributor, with 80 million pounds to the International Fund for Ireland.	0.8873437284903739
The European Union contributes 75% of the Peace and Reconciliation programme.	0.8742808801137898
All in all, INTERREG, the International Fund for Ireland and the Peace and Reconciliation programme have all played an important role in the developing peace process.	0.8236202529966922
Mr President, I am taking the floor to speak about INTERREG, but I shall confine myself to a few criticisms, which will clearly also enable me to keep to my speaking time.	1.0068873193698054
We have all spoken favourably of this programme' s confirmation and of the extension of the sectors it covers to include the field of transnational and interregional cooperation, in addition to cross-border cooperation.	0.7617202387597835
However, this does not blind us to the fact that the majority of resources - 50-80% - will be reserved for cross-border cooperation, for INTERREG IIIA. Therefore, we still think the decision to consolidate the current areas of cooperation in this strand, regarding the selection of eligible regions, is wrong and contradictory.	0.928803529990927
We hope that the Commission will want to look into this and acknowledge Parliament' s position in practical terms, and not just with a formal tribute.	1.0952213801715596
Cross-border cooperation continues almost exclusively to be an issue concerning landlocked areas and, where exceptions have been made for maritime areas, their selection is not transparent and they often suffer from compensation from other Community policies.	0.8407795281734703
This discrimination is much more serious for islands that have a regional status that can only be linked to areas of an exclusively maritime nature.	0.610043241021194
This is in line with ongoing discrimination, which ignores Article 158 of the Treaty on island regions with regard to cohesion policies.	0.8043785135542152
More serious still is the fact that this is occurring while ignoring the new situation associated with the approach that has been adopted towards the enlargement process for the inclusion of regions such as Malta.	0.8759510980434556
This has given rise to the proposals we are making to at least extend the regions eligible to include the NUTS III Sicilian provinces which have a frontier with Malta and to include all the regions of the Adriatic which share a frontier with Balkan regions.	0.648459482601932
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express the satisfaction I have in noting that the most remote regions, including the French overseas departments, have received some attention in connection with the INTERREG III initiative, opening up new perspectives for their cooperation with other countries in their geographical area, even though it is true that more could have been expected, particularly with regard to access to the various strands.	0.819440780670711
For a long time, probably a survival of our colonial heritage, our regions have fixed their attention on the European mainland, ignoring and even scorning their closest neighbours.	0.6905548839125559
That time is now past.	0.41435103733425444
Our regions have become aware of belonging to an environment that they are connected to, not only in geographical terms but also in terms of their culture and the history of their peoples, hence the intensely expressed aspiration to become more deeply rooted in this environment.	0.7091559111323621
This increased awareness does not, however, affect identity alone.	0.34289528452413964
It is fostered by a fair appraisal of our assets.	0.41620105466064145
So, for example, the island of Réunion is located on a trade axis between the countries of southern Africa and those of south-east Asia.	0.7623530474226314
It cannot afford to remain outside the regional alliances being forged in this area, lest it miss out on a historic opportunity, and the same applies to our regions in the Caribbean.	0.7048409251582815
At last we are convinced that our young people may start to see an end to the tragic unemployment, the source of so much despair, if we can export to neighbouring countries the know-how which we have gained thanks to the operation of the European structural funds.	0.7832237063023864
INTERREG appropriations may be used to make our regions into veritable European Union bridgeheads into these geographical areas, giving it worldwide scope.	0.6115216285197068
I am counting on the Commission, and specifically on you, Commissioner, to allocate adequate resources for effective action.	0.8934127669586128
Mr President, Commissioners, I greatly welcome the possibilities for increased trans-European cooperation under INTERREG, but my concern is that the proposal offers fewer opportunities in this respect for maritime than for other areas.	0.8352447285592606
I understand the Commission' s own concern that distance may prove detrimental to effective cooperation.	0.5391830995962223
Nonetheless, there are many maritime areas between which links are already established.	0.6987992248023586
Various local authorities around the North Sea provide a prime example of this.	0.4260824774190794
INTERREG could well allow enhancement of such cooperation.	0.25281834730727126
In consequence, I seek some small adjustments to the guidelines to provide a little more flexibility and to accommodate the ways in which the interests of maritime areas can fall between strand A and strand B. These adjustments include clarifying the possibilities for cooperation between maritime areas and permitting greater development of practical and visible projects, particularly those of an infrastructural kind.	0.7529280528452522
Such measures will put maritime and insular areas on an equal footing with other areas of the EU.	0.6225492998075391
I hope for their adoption.	0.44528782881232387
Mr President, our group welcomes the horizontal thrust of the EQUAL initiative so that, if you are a British Muslim physically disabled in some way you no longer have to chose which category of discrimination you belong to as a target group: you can use your expertise and experience to solve problems, rather than being defined as the problem.	0.7960841132608368
There is a lot of expertise within the relevant organisations which deserves to be shared.	0.5369531951882064
We also welcome the recognition of the need for evaluation and the dissemination of best practice for the tightening up of the transnational level.	0.6642156969242055
We are concerned, therefore, as others have said, at the number of amendments which seek to exclude even further some of society' s most excluded, by aiming for a very narrow definition of "refugee".	0.779788330005589
My group will not be supporting those amendments.	0.6288012655443441
We are also concerned at the number of amendments which, in seeking to introduce greater flexibility, run the risk perhaps of obscuring responsibility for the management of the EQUAL initiative.	0.918343936182371
Mr President, I am very pleased to see URBAN orientated towards a more integrated approach which attempts to solve interrelated problems.	0.7765358972373636
Yet, there is some risk of dilution of effort. If we pursue too many objectives, our overall effectiveness suffers.	0.9180095249434632
Of course, every instance of a deprived urban area is a separate case.	0.6229886647031305
But there is a common factor, a hard core, comprising unemployment, the resignation or withdrawal of public services and the disappearance of small and medium-sized enterprises, both commercial and other kinds.	0.8351797585024993
I would wish URBAN to be orientated mainly towards providing answers to those causes of urban deprivation.	0.4234504866747291
For this, of course, central policy must interact and be coordinated with development policy, so that the latter too can be reorientated and can work synergistically with the objectives of any URBAN programmes implemented in our countries, and so that it is not just using them as an alibi for its own shortcomings.	0.8641301339771024
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall confine my observations to Mr Decourrière' s report.	0.6755971316072583
The INTERREG Community Initiative Programme is an extremely important tool in terms of the development and regional planning of European territory, most particularly with reference to effectively taking into account the relationship between the centre of the European Union and its outlying regions.	0.9211061414374582
INTERREG must, therefore, be an instrument promoting territorial cohesion throughout the Union if we do not wish to see a two- or even three-speed European territory.	0.8255529793290829
It is obvious to me that the regional and local authorities, and their representative bodies, the Committee of the Regions and, of course, the European Parliament should have been involved in the clearest way possible and at the earliest possible opportunity framing this programme.	1.1195341632905442
Indeed, I am forced to observe that this was not the case when the Commission drew up its communication, published on 13 October last year.	0.9008647792219251
Even though I approve of the general guidelines of INTERREG III, I feel it is extremely important to ensure better coordination between this programme, financed by the ERDF, and the other external cooperation funds, including in particular the European Development Fund, intended for ACP countries.	1.0044240836633802
In this connection, I should like to thank the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for adopting one of my amendments adding the EDF to the list of these funds.	0.6592223947206005
The most remote regions, particularly the four French overseas departments, must be able to coordinate INTERREG III and the EDF in order to fund, in turn, cooperation projects with their ACP neighbours in their respective geographical areas.	0.8036579457507045
Furthermore, I would ask the Commission to please reconsider the limited opportunities that have been offered to the most remote and island regions according to the guidelines put forward in the communication.	0.9954273763761536
It is essential for these regions to be able to benefit fully from INTERREG III, just like all the other regions in the Union, especially now that the REGIS programme dedicated to such isolated regions has been dropped.	0.8197181590993161
Finally, in conclusion, I would like to express my regret at the low level of funding allocated to strand C, for interregional cooperation, even though the added value this offers the Community is undeniable.	0.8160632052718366
Mr President, my starting point is the EQUAL report and equality between men and women, although I must admit that it is sometimes hard to talk about this issue, which has a feeling of déjà vu about it when you are my age, in any case.	0.9193173514616657
Unfortunately, it is necessary to point out again that we do not have equality.	0.9789697906423382
A breakthrough in this regard may perhaps lead to changes in other areas, however.	0.7478696642787954
For me, equality certainly does not mean that both parties to a marriage work the whole time and hand the children over to a nanny, alias an immigrant who has not had the opportunity to obtain another job.	0.5549784779439175
If that is the case, we have not progressed one little bit since pagan times.	0.9633495310620598
No, equality means that we all participate in both working life and family life.	0.7096881867639739
Unfortunately, developments are not moving in that direction.	0.5171552047646354
On the contrary.	0.6444749927142581
I think, therefore, that paragraph 7 contains something very central, i.e. that EQUAL will be used as a testing ground for developing and promoting new ways of delivering employment policies.	0.6809330535871557
One can only hope that it succeeds.	0.6570979301957106
I should just like to say, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, that if I am not here when the Commission responds - not that I have asked any specific questions, but I should nonetheless hope that the Commission has been paying attention - then that is because the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities is meeting to discuss women in the decision-making process at the same time as the present debate is going on.	1.0084720448079443
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, those who work on rural areas know that, of the programmes which the European Union has managed, the LEADER programme, both LEADER I and LEADER II, is one of its success stories, and I hope that the same will be true of LEADER+.	1.0047141585453254
One of the reasons why it has been so successful is that the basic concept of the LEADER programmes aroused substantial interest in activities amongst the population concerned.	0.8077977731624242
I am glad that LEADER+ is to remain true to this underlying concept.	0.5377734383387411
There is a problem, however, which we need to address together.	1.057522782522001
Because LEADER is a kind of workshop with a bottom-up approach, a huge number of ideas have come to fruition in recent years through LEADER I and II which of course at some point will no longer be brand new or as successful as they once were.	0.6950377091978385
And because of the programme' s success and its basic approach they will of course at some point then be dropped from LEADER.	0.6126540004598545
That is why, where the good LEADER projects are concerned, we need to ensure that those which have proved to be outstanding are not suddenly discontinued; instead the ideas which have proved to be worthwhile need at some stage to be transferred into the standard programmes as a reliable, positive component of our support to rural areas.	0.7572813648004095
Of course this is also the basic idea.	0.8651990115584659
It is to take new ideas and try them out in LEADER, with the participants on the ground, with the local organisations on the ground, with many non-governmental organisations, with the churches, with all those who have helped actually to get new ideas up and running in rural communities.	0.8877887163452262
Here we must ensure that the good schemes, those which are really excellent, are then somehow transferred into rural development policy to safeguard the future of this laudable work.	0.8965188555817437
My request to the Commission is that it should make sure that the organisations and sections of the population which get involved really are accepted.	1.0654407983065064
There should be no attempt to have one or other organisation, which is just being formed with a view to contributing a new idea and is not yet so well known, pushed a little on to the sidelines, say because of official local or regional policy.	0.7438118091795924
Have faith in the successful results which LEADER has had so far.	0.4012068217617333
At the beginning it is sometimes a little like chasing a rainbow if we say that a plan is too idealistic.	0.7313398214870286
And then when the work and the action start something emerges which the official policy, including ourselves at this level, could never have imagined would suddenly have developed so well.	0.6872353927822399
That was the charm of LEADER, and that should please not be lost!	0.8436739325342275
Mr President, I welcome the EQUAL initiative and the report which highlights the need to distinguish between actions to combat discrimination against women and actions to combat discrimination against minority groups.	0.9431017940735441
Women are not a minority and often suffer double discrimination as members of minority groups as well as because of their gender.	0.5963776515282059
This is why specific action for women is needed, as well as mainstreaming.	0.7712799525319748
The report addresses this and proposes integrating action to achieve equality between women and men in all aspects of work; it also recognises the importance of working with local and regional bodies which are those closest to the people to help ensure that all project results are mainstreamed.	0.7254250227865056
The involvement of voluntary and community groups will also be an essential ingredient of the EQUAL initiative and the projects.	0.7471326527762198
The development partnerships within the thematic fields, which are referred to in Amendment No. 22, would enable even the smaller organisations to play a part in the EQUAL initiative.	0.8819310127365315
My group will be supporting Amendment No. 22.	0.7515507886845308
Mr President, the report under discussion in the House today is doubtless of great importance.	0.9867054409862914
In addition to the objectives it is working towards, the strong point of the Community initiative INTERREG for the 2000-2006 programming period lies in its added value from the viewpoint of what is now the imminent enlargement of the European Union to include new Eastern European and Mediterranean countries.	0.8948735675352312
In my opinion, it is precisely in anticipation of this deadline that the European Union should strive to reduce disparities between regions and put an end to the isolation of border areas.	0.7616120023146269
Indeed, these areas - and it is right to stress this - have an important role to play as an interface with the applicant countries that are going to join the Union.	0.9862665914611003
It is precisely with this in mind that I tabled some amendments which I consider to be of the utmost importance, and that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has subsequently taken up.	0.9181622427244223
They call for the areas eligible for cross-border cooperation to be extended to all regions of the Adriatic, as well as to the Sicilian provinces which have a frontier with Malta - an applicant country - which, inexplicably, are not currently included in strand A, Annex 1.	0.8154662082828695
I am confident that Commissioner Barnier and the President of the European Commission will duly consider Parliament' s position on the matter, in accordance with the Code of Conduct.	0.9366414012305309
There are fundamental advantages for the whole of Europe for it to promote cooperation with the applicant countries and to support border regions.	0.8480776152305317
Finally, it is to be hoped that greater coordination will be sought between the INTERREG initiative and the existing Community programmes, which are significant for external policy, as a vector for greater integration and for the joint drafting of programmes.	0.9398873199529276
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, LEADER I was an outright success due, in particular, to the great flexibility of the administrative management between the Commission and the local operators.	0.7960799054781302
It is, I think, regrettable that the Commission could not make a similar assessment of LEADER II, regarding the quality of the projects, the quantity of appropriations spent and, most especially, the demotivation of some local operators in the face of the administrative and financial unwieldiness they encountered.	0.9020497228293675
I am pleased to see, however, that under LEADER+, new resources have been allocated to helping rural territories to develop their potential and to implement the objectives of local and sustainable development.	0.8331792464887793
I feel it is important to put special emphasis on trying out new ways to raise the profile of the natural and cultural heritage and to strengthen the economic environment, in order to promote employment.	0.8142668616956428
The time is now right, I think, to consider including the exchange of positive development experience in the scope of transnational cooperation.	0.9014143868192235
It is interesting to note that all rural areas may be eligible for LEADER II.	0.5597542492818196
Nonetheless, if the opportunity for Member States to determine the areas, within the scope of this initiative, remains available, then the Commission will have to ensure a certain focusing of resources and prioritise projects in the less prosperous areas.	1.0680257005053546
There must, of course, be transparency regarding the selection criteria for projects and local action groups.	0.6740138277205822
I also feel there are grounds for ensuring, in particular, that the financial channels of States or local authorities are not behind the delays in payment which may have caused some LAGs to become bankrupt under LEADER II.	0.7127538311882028
Mr President, as a Member from one of the outermost regions, I must point out that this is a very special afternoon as far as regional policy is concerned, because of the debate on two Community initiatives, URBAN and INTERREG.	1.132672830807908
I would like to remind you that these initiatives are aimed, firstly, in the case of URBAN, at improving the quality of life of the citizens who live in the poorer parts of various European cities, and, in the case of INTERREG, at facilitating cohesion and recognising the diversity and potential of the regions of the European Union, particularly by including the outermost regions in strands B and C.	0.9456133767055644
Like the rapporteur, we deplore the fact that it has been excluded from strand IIIA.	0.9677093053400116
With regard to INTERREG, we are very happy that there is a reference to the creation of a European monitoring centre concerned with cooperation.	1.0525825400730398
I would like to thank the rapporteurs, particularly Mr Decourrière, for his sensitivity towards the regions and for accepting our amendments.	0.9148311538688373
I hope that the Commissioner will accept the proposal which we are making.	1.2020558250803925
Mr President, with regard to the various initiatives which we are analysing this afternoon, I would like to concentrate strictly on one of them, that is, the URBAN programme.	0.9347281047116046
It is a fact that we are debating this programme today because the European Parliament insisted that this initiative should be maintained.	1.0414304622611588
The Commission proposed removing it and other initiatives, but Parliament' s proposal and the sensitivity of the Commission itself at the time led to the URBAN initiative being retained.	1.1168911994805093
I believe that we should be pleased about this.	1.0431244861372908
But what were the Commission' s arguments, from Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies and Director-General Eneko Landaburu in particular, for eliminating the URBAN programme?	0.6611487039355356
Its argument was one of priority.	0.3037443529047277
The urban question is so important that we cannot tighten our belts and undervalue it with a programme which has such a small budget.	0.7034897188233117
Today the programme is in place and therefore I believe we have achieved something important, that distinguishing mark of the European Union called the URBAN programme.	0.957570270078543
However, I would like to address Commissioner Barnier and support the argument of Commissioner Wulf-Mathies and the Director-General, because I think they were absolutely right.	0.8202126490757117
The urban dimension must be incorporated much more deeply in all the structural funds.	0.6455003103413305
The amount of budget required by our cities - where 80% of the European population live and which increasingly represent both the best and the worst of what we have in Europe, I believe, clearly indicates that the European dimension should be taken into account and that this URBAN programme should not be used as an excuse not to analyse in detail, not to prioritise and, therefore, not to introduce an infinitely greater budgetary contribution into programmes which affect the cities, by means of European funds.	0.9534902864028062
Therefore, I do not believe I need to restate the number of factors which demand this investment in urban areas, factors which are on the agenda, and I would like to say to the Commissioner that we hope he will be sensitive in this respect.	0.9072608531800659
In welcoming the cross-sectoral approach embodied in the new EQUAL initiative, it is crucial that the programme addresses the distinct forms of discrimination which militate against disabled people in particular: physical barriers in the workplace affecting those with limited mobility, visual information systems which exclude blind workers, working systems which effectively close the door on people with learning difficulties or with mental health problems.	0.5742985057792656
Organisations of disabled people and disabled people' s non-disabled representatives must have a proper interest at every stage of decision-making.	0.5121830401949944
That is why this Parliament has put forward paragraphs 10 and 15 of the resolution, to ensure that Member States cannot ignore any one target group.	0.9015203516123302
Disabled people have too often been left off the list.	0.4387407534877783
Because disabled people do not form one homogenous group - for example many deaf people see themselves as a linguistic minority denied respect for their own language and culture - it is necessary as stated in paragraph 9 to enable some partnerships to be defined which are specific to a particular disability or other group.	0.6908491501973852
EQUAL remains crucial also to regions like my own, in the east of England, outside the principal funds of Objective I. We have had an extra incentive to take up Community initiative funding and an excellent record in response.	0.8066428002754679
Former ADAPT projects range from the CORE project, which has developed new supply chains for the car industry in Bedfordshire, to projects to raise standards in small businesses in Hertfordshire in Essex.	0.6726433055044584
We have seen the NOW project helping 70 women to return to work in Suffolk, many of whom were able to come and share the results of their experience directly with us at the European Parliament in Brussels.	0.8357728252093568
EQUAL remains important to us because it is precisely in relatively more prosperous regions that lower-skilled jobs are being shed, which can be an important first destination for those discriminated against in the labour market.	0.7329781900498457
Finally, a word on INTERREG.	0.9213858695716783
It really is quite nonsensical that partnerships set up in 1994 are being rolled over now to the exclusion of new inter-regional links.	0.5151495705845819
During this period the ports of Great Yarmouth and Harwich on the Essex-Suffolk-Norfolk coast have launched significant new transportation and economic links with partners in the Netherlands.	0.39755545752833255
I urge Parliament to support our Amendment No 2, which would ensure flexibility so as to include new areas, particularly on maritime borders.	0.9806783628010294
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for the information of the House, Mr President, I should like to make a clarification.	0.8125042700622318
Chancellor Schüssel' s government will maintain the refugee policy of the former social democratic government led by Chancellor Klima.	0.6111921075899047
There is no change in refugee policy in Austria!	0.607344668584872
Rural areas make up over 80% of the EU' s territory and 25% of the population live in them.	0.7908777841874202
As a farmer and Member of Parliament, I have always endeavoured not to look at agriculture in isolation but to see rural areas as a whole.	0.7990591645742625
I attach particular importance to adopting an integrated approach towards rural development because I am convinced that only cooperation linking up all people from all walks of life in rural areas will permit them to be active and attractive places to live for everyone; I refer, in short, to the multifunctionality of rural areas.	0.7513139391136002
I should like to welcome in particular the new LEADER+ programme because of its comprehensive nature.	0.7947985827328489
In the future it will be possible to have programmes not only in the individual zones eligible for structural aid but in all the regions of the EU.	0.9250861965328013
This across-the-board approach is sensible because the programmes for rural development are also structured in this way.	0.6928628277464995
In the future, funding will no longer come from three funds but from the EAGGF Guidance section alone.	0.5733101368228772
It will therefore be necessary to increase the quality of the programmes because the EAGGF is supposed to be an effective financial instrument.	0.8981714316727616
Greater precision in the selection process will lead to greater effectiveness, because the money should not be squandered recklessly.	0.7520845286537103
In addition, I should particularly like to emphasise the point which offers an approach towards creating an integrated and environmentally friendly development strategy.	0.778058768760076
There is great potential for future job creation in rural areas here and we must exploit this if we wish to offer fresh prospects to people living in the countryside.	0.6825165066100841
That is why policy for rural areas is more than a policy just for farmers.	0.8340575804794409
LEADER+ should supplement already existing programmes, avoid overlaps and duplication of financing and thus contribute to a process of development which is as comprehensive as possible.	0.5281721471085001
In this way, LEADER+ can, together with the programmes under Regulation (EC) No 1257/99, consolidate the second pillar of the CAP even more effectively and produce the best possible benefits for the whole of the countryside.	0.661316202939084
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am not always proud of the fuss that goes on here in Parliament, but the URBAN programme is one of the best examples of our work: it was created following an initiative in Parliament.	0.9216768783013753
The Commission would have abolished URBAN, but this time Parliament drew the longer straw.	0.9249712126233375
It is good that URBAN is to continue, as it has had good results at local level.	0.9231051371033627
The problems in Europe' s urban areas are getting worse; fortunately, we now have consensus with the Commission.	0.7595449083791324
The majority of the population of Europe live in cities, and their problems are among the most pressing within the context of regional policy and very complex matters in themselves.	0.8503515199040659
There is an immense risk of exclusion.	0.5593359386997958
In many cities in France and England there are now slums, breeding grounds for many sorts of problems.	0.520976993268526
None of us wants South American type favelas in Europe.	0.313473246747613
We have to act now, before it is too late.	0.9594542669359176
Our cities are also of decisive importance for Europe' s economy.	0.6283049825096035
We always come back to the same basic problem in Europe: our economy does not support the individual sufficiently, nor is it sufficiently dynamic.	0.7672856514014522
The economy has to be strong for us to be able to attend to the problems of our fellow-citizens and our environment.	0.8565867313785087
This is not policy; it is life' s simple logic.	0.7761011700342396
It is good that spending has become focused, as otherwise the buckshot gets scattered to the four winds.	0.6453187797454787
Now we have to concentrate on solving problems in small and middle-size towns and cities, as they do not have enough resources.	0.9276025549452882
In this way we will also be able to speed up matters in surrounding rural areas; it is often forgotten that urban and rural problems in fact go hand in hand.	0.7312538873695897
The basis for all this is that we should be encouraging individual innovation and entrepreneurship, as group action begun by the individual will help revitalise an area internally.	0.9324023936236644
Granting funds without an economy that can stand on its own two feet is like carrying water to fill up a dry well: there will be enough to drink for a while, but tomorrow the well will be dry again.	0.6333203495296819
Mr President, with the implementation of INTERREG III, European cooperation policy is entering a new phase.	0.9180668038403997
Our attention is no longer focused exclusively on internal borders but also on external ones.	0.6383604139456536
In the context of globalisation and cultural openness which characterise the current situation, the European Union needs instruments that will allow it to strengthen its links and communication channels with neighbouring regions, particularly in Eastern and Southern Europe.	0.8069992614937027
The Union' s borders must no longer be an obstacle to balanced development, but - on the contrary - an opportunity, a bridge to more fruitful cooperation.	0.9227109989080433
By means of amendments adopted in committee, Parliament has tried to supplement the Commission' s work, by including new elements in the list of areas targeted for aid, and in particular external border areas and maritime border areas in Southern Europe.	0.8145564346626277
In its draft guidelines, the Commission acknowledges that these borders require greater attention than they did in the past.	0.7503503106277081
This is on account of the process of enlargement to the east and that of greater integration with the Mediterranean countries.	0.8748874281351164
As President Prodi too mentioned when outlining the strategic objectives for the period 2000-2005, boosting the Barcelona process is a priority for the Union, and the INTERREG III initiative will be able to make its contribution to the pursuit of this strategic objective.	0.7995767263455282
In congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent work, we can but hope that the Commission will duly take into consideration the proposals Parliament has put forward, in accordance with the commitments made under the Code of Conduct on the implementation of structural policies, and that it will confirm, with fitting amendments, the transformation of this Community initiative from a mere instrument for internal redistribution to an opportunity to boost and enhance relations with neighbouring countries.	0.9545884532034922
Mr President, from this year until the year 2006 around EUR 200 billion is available for the Structural Funds, but only 5¾ % is set aside for the Community initiatives, INTERREG, LEADER, URBAN and EQUAL.	0.9090718873420389
That is a reduction of 3¾ % compared with the previous CIs.	0.7618442413660965
No more than EUR 2.8 billion is provided for EQUAL, as Mrs Stenzel' s balanced report makes clear.	0.7674708275431277
This makes the large number of amendments and far too long a wish list of possible tasks all the more astonishing.	0.7128482838635825
How are priorities supposed to be set here?	0.6300291325383905
There is agreement on the principle that marginalisation, discrimination and inequalities on the labour market should be reduced.	0.825665309358685
Transnational strategies are intended to make it possible for disadvantaged groups to have access to jobs.	0.6640068889011057
I have no sympathy for amendments once again backing the TAOs. Criticism of the previous Commission' s work was particularly severe, legitimately so, with regard to these Technical Assistance Offices.	0.7576170820792264
Our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was, after all, in overall charge of analysing considerable shortcomings and failures to carry out checks in cases related to LEONARDO.	0.6351587193843545
The Commission cannot therefore be relieved of direct responsibility or the task of carrying out inspections under EQUAL either.	0.6664220274389369
It can only approve Member States' proposals if they fulfil all the criteria: firstly, integration through sectoral and geographical development partnerships, whereby the employment policy guidelines need to be taken into account; secondly, the systematic involvement of the operators concerned - the local, regional and national authorities, training institutions, universities, NGOs, the two sides of industry and the private sector - with the aim of creating a durable partnership, and thirdly, methods and models of indisputably innovative character.	0.7996944455652236
The Commission must therefore be the guarantor of the strategic framework for promoting ability to work and quality of work, of the assessment of results and of the effective communication of best practices.	0.8801787976280661
Only then will it be possible for the desired multiplier effect to be achieved.	0.6533645584617817
Mr President, I want to refer to the Commission proposals on the budget line to promote the CAP.	1.1072925574716115
On 26 October 1999 the European Commission adopted a proposal to ensure that a legal basis is given to the budget line informing the public about the CAP.	0.9019364820907931
This proposal will remove the current budget line B2-5122 and create a new budget heading B1-382.	0.49411559262633886
Actions which promote understanding between young farmers and the EU and also create stronger links with EU candidate countries and the outside world are important.	0.7010318688112444
Therefore I am putting forward these amendments to Parliament to give its support to the contributions of this type of programme.	0.7624001631450912
Given the need to encourage young farmers to continue in farming it is vitally important that they are well-informed about developments in the common agricultural policy.	0.7735702478364078
Informing and training young farmers at European level is vitally important.	0.4942405582614211
I would ask you to support that part of the available budget should be concentrated on the development of knowledge amongst European young farmers.	0.6327590928491508
Regarding information and training, in the past this budget line has been allocated for information, communication and training.	0.8059990842792106
But the Commission is now proposing that training should no longer be included.	0.9859123459465253
I feel that training should be included where it provides relevant information at European level about the CAP.	0.63531785510306
Such European training is one element in ensuring that young farmers have the necessary knowledge of the CAP to make sound business decisions for the future.	0.6218869633014921
Therefore I am putting forward three amendments.	0.28686275023995095
I would urge Parliament to support them.	0.7911664139306125
Mr President, I am taking the floor to express my opinion, drawn from my experience of municipal administration, that the URBAN projects should, or rather must, have a threefold purpose: firstly, to promote the restoration of infrastructure and historic, old and perhaps dilapidated areas of cities.	0.8882037953977904
Secondly, to promote and stimulate economic activity and social life within these historic centres, within these old quarters of our cities.	0.87209264108875
There is little point in having streets which are now wonderfully lit, with new pavements, with newly paved road surfaces, all whitewashed and beautiful, if we are not able to fill them with activity and, therefore, employment.	0.8314421515699566
I would like to make it clear that it is not just a question of finance or aid to the different social operators, but rather also of selecting those projects which are aimed at employment, or to put it another way, projects which will tend to favour the creation and promotion of jobs.	0.9139582150405592
Thirdly - and perhaps this should be the first objective - the projects should principally be aimed at the complete rehabilitation of people and families, because man is not made for the law, but rather law is made for man.	1.0393852480946597
These areas of our cities are often home to single-parent families, elderly people who receive a pension and no longer carry out productive activity, and families facing difficulties; sometimes they are families which have broken down and which are excluded from mainstream society.	0.6100840412728693
These people live in areas which should benefit from these projects.	0.5218535628090603
If we have success in this threefold sense, I believe that these families, these people, these European citizens, will believe more in Europe, and this seems to me to be very important because, ultimately, the cities will increasingly come to play a leading role in European life.	1.0187855929611231
. (FR) Mr President, before my friends and fellow Commissioners, Franz Fischler and Anna Diamantopoulou, in turn come to speak - since all three of us who are responsible for these four Community initiatives have had the opportunity to follow this debate with the same interest, I would like to endeavour to speak on the subject of URBAN and INTERREG, which many of you have brought up and discussed.	0.9072659813069102
Straight away I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteurs from the committees, from all the committees, but also to the speakers for the groups and to each and every one of you for the quality of your speeches and the great interest they express with regard to these two initiatives.	0.9391047657190877
This is particularly true of what Mrs McCarthy said about URBAN. I should like to thank her not only for her work and for the report which she presented but also - and I do not see why I in turn should not say so too - for all we owe her, for all you owe her as far as this is initiative, as well as, more generally, all we owe Parliament.	1.0011530940443003
I am mindful of the fact that it was in fact the European Parliament which made the political decision and supported the continuation of this initiative for the regeneration of urban areas in difficulties, in favour of sustainable urban development, involving at the same time this integrated approach, which we value, to handle the economic, social and environmental aspects simultaneously.	0.975961875029206
Some other points of agreement highlighted in Mrs McCarthy' s report, the effectiveness of this instrument through the concentration of funding and a critical mass for intervention, the horizontal operation which we think more conducive to disseminating results and increasing the exchange of experience and good practice and, finally, the increasing role of local authorities in the planning and management of the programmes, on the basis of a real partnership.	0.8543894273969408
Having mentioned the fundamental points of agreement between the Commission' s proposals and Parliament and, having stressed my great interest in hearing the various contributions, I should like to answer a few of the criticisms and a few of the suggestions which have been made, with apologies if I cannot attribute each of the questions to the speakers by name.	0.8954962006271885
I think however that you will all recognise your own comments.	0.6150194514278736
Firstly on the subject of the URBAN programme and the maximum threshold of fifty towns, which a number of you termed arbitrary.	0.8067726863843689
I can understand your concern.	0.5547179270974137
I have therefore asked my services to be willing to consider a reasonable increase in the number of towns eligible under the URBAN programme conditional upon certain guarantees, firstly on concentration - I am thinking particularly of the target areas which must have a minimum of 20 000 or, in exceptional cases, 10 000 inhabitants - and also upon the critical mass of funding: we must keep to EUR 500 per inhabitant so that the European Union action may be both effective and clear, and so that it does not resemble a sort of scattering of resources which would have no real impact either for citizens or for municipalities.	0.8799064031638163
That is my initial response to the threshold question.	0.653049634500247
Regarding a second matter, now, relating to the additional criteria, which should be taken into consideration in selecting disadvantaged areas. Here, too, I am willing to demonstrate greater flexibility and to consider other relevant criteria in addition to the Community criteria given in point 11 of the guidance project.	0.8955178329630767
Third point: specific measures in favour of some social groups - some speakers mentioned them - women, but also immigrants and refugees, must be envisaged.	0.7888663745225143
This concern, ladies and gentlemen, lies at the very heart of our URBAN initiative, and I am willing to rewrite the text, if necessary, in order to make this message clearer yet.	0.7990099593160975
Regarding URBAN, I should like to conclude with the implementation procedure and mention, first of all, the selection procedure.	0.7890270397869047
Some speakers wanted it to be less bureaucratic, more transparent, and to avoid redundancy in terms of the projects and funding.	1.040037519223243
Ladies and gentlemen, on this point we must make it clear: in the context of subsidiarity, the selection of zones or municipalities eligible for URBAN is primarily the responsibility of the Member States.	0.9478239138778894
As far as the Commission is concerned, it is willing to avoid any unjustified bureaucratic overload, but we cannot give up the practice of checking the relevance and quality of the proposed programmes, indeed you would be the first to criticise us if we did.	1.0318540120949282
A second observation, the time limits for the submission of programmes and the possibility of submitting a planning supplement in addition to the programmes.	0.7162791387563148
I have no objection to the idea of submitting a planning supplement jointly with the main programme.	0.5906122616128493
This cannot, however, be grounds for an extension of the original time limit.	0.7264616759953891
Let me remind you that the time limit for this programme is six months.	0.7719123222082408
This time limit, which indeed is identical to the one we granted for INTERREG and for the Objective 2 DOCUPs, should normally be adequate, I feel, for drawing up a programme, which does not mean that the projects cannot be defined at a later stage.	0.9533827426217601
With regard to URBAN, I should like to conclude with a final observation.	0.7183465465060955
One of you expressed a wish that these urban issues should not be confined to the URBAN initiative.	0.7085810939684094
I agree completely.	0.16755573821968636
I myself expressed my concern at the meeting of Ministers for regional and urban planning, a concern to which I devote myself, that in the DOCUPs and the CSFs in the planning which we are currently starting to negotiate, my concern, as I said, that, apart from the URBAN initiative, urban issues should be addressed in all the Objective 1 and Objective 2 programmes, and I believe I can express both our awareness of such issues and also our commitment to include them, beyond the scope of URBAN, in all structural fund programming.	0.9890636535497971
But, as for the future, since we must look ahead, I am extremely concerned to see how URBAN is going to be implemented in practical terms, and also to see what our experience will be and what lessons we can learn, because plainly these urban issues are going to be the focus of what may be, for future financial perspectives, a new European regional planning policy.	1.1905739351163347
I am not forgetting, and we cannot forget, that 80% of the citizens of Europe today live in towns and that is why this URBAN instrument is extremely important.	1.113487602472833
Let me repeat what I have said, we shall be most attentive to the inclusion of urban issues in all structural fund programming.	0.7994434331343899
I should now, Mr President, like to bring up the subject of INTERREG and to thank the rapporteur, Francis Decourrière, in the same way that I thanked Arlene McCarthy, for the quality and relevance of his work.	0.9915334518468909
He stressed a number of points, with which we may indicate our agreement, as many of you did too - the importance of this trans-European cooperation, with its three strands, cross-border, transnational, interregional; the added value to the Community provided by INTERREG, its clarity in relation to the general framework of the structural funds, and the truly cross-border and transnational strengthening of eligible programmes and operations; the importance of common structures and what, in discussing another debate which begins today, the Intergovernmental Conference, I termed the common European spirit which we have to strengthen, and here, with INTERREG, thanks to INTERREG, is a way to strengthen common spirit through common structures for the implementation of programmes with real financial solidarity; the importance of partnership in guaranteeing the active participation of all the local and regional authorities concerned as well as private sector associations and economic and social partners.	0.9174935145132272
Having made these general observations, I should like to focus on your main comments with regard to INTERREG.	0.587342800633061
The first relate to the timetable and the content of this initiative.	0.743541532346841
You comment that these guidelines were adopted at too late a date, stressing, particularly your rapporteur, the risk that the previous programmes will be interrupted.	0.8350664231511327
It is true, I admit it, and you are well aware of the reasons, ladies and gentlemen.	1.0923117701611358
There is a delay in adopting the INTERREG guidelines in March or April 2000.	0.5360472773540278
I accept this; I take note of it as you do.	0.6905861488433861
I note, however, that the Member States and the regions are already actively preparing the programmes for INTERREG III and indeed the guidance project was distributed over three months ago now.	0.7889391448081117
I also note that eligibility for expenditure shall be accepted from the date that programmes are presented and I can confirm the possibility that they may be available retroactively back to 1 January, if the programme is presented before 30 April.	0.8122157835244456
So much for the first comment.	0.895110998032325
As to the second comment: regarding the non-comprehensive list of measures eligible under strand B, I wish to inform you, to confirm, that I have asked the Commission to accept the inclusion of other specific subjects, particularly in favour of small- and medium-sized businesses and of cultural heritage, in the list of schemes eligible under strand B and that therefore this list must no longer be considered as a comprehensive one.	0.971814026880599
Third point: interregional cooperation, the importance of strand C. The Commission shares the observations made by this House regarding the importance of strand C, interregional cooperation.	0.8690547682975035
As your rapporteur has requested, I shall send you the detailed information regarding the system for the implementation of this strand.	0.9085290334282878
Fourth observation: the European Observatory and the possible use of a technical assistance office.	0.8149683316841879
As you requested, I have decided to remove all references to the use of a technical assistance office in the text until the outcome of the debate in progress within the Commission on the service outsourcing systems.	0.9559212282091918
But, ladies and gentlemen, if we do remove every reference and any recourse to a TAO at a later date then this will have a consequence and that will be an increase in the number of officials' jobs needed to do this work, because somebody will have to do it and I cannot keep redeploying the same staff indefinitely, at a time when our duties are increasing with the pre-accession structural instrument (ISPA) and in order to ensure that, the Community appropriations for which I am responsible, often in partnership or on terms of coresponsibility with Member States, are monitored better, with discipline and transparency.	0.8567601004346806
Now to the implementation of INTERREG, a subject mentioned by many of you, and the potential eligibility under strand A, 'cross-border cooperation' , of schemes in the Adriatic, on behalf of Sicily or for the most remote regions, the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, understands your concerns and takes note of your requests on these various points.	0.9102099962158753
I therefore intend to amend the guidelines in order to incorporate a specific priority into the transnational strand B: 'integrated cooperation of maritime and island regions' , so as to cover, in what I think is an appropriate fashion the various opportunities for cooperation between these regions.	0.7397008551603607
In addition to this one overture there is a second which we have already suggested to the Member States: greater financial flexibility between strand A and strand B. Thanks to these two overtures, especially the first, I can say that the Commission is willing to examine the case of Italian regions and regions of third countries around the Adriatic in order to promote the most appropriate cooperation under INTERREG, and with other instruments too, as soon as they become available.	0.9731231879201394
I have decided, in the end, that the most remote regions, to which I attach particular importance, will be given special priority in the context of the transnational strand of INTERREG, with a cooperation strategy which will aim at improving their links with their neighbours and other Member State regions.	0.9563027379841343
I also wish to express my concern to ensure good cooperation between INTERREG and the EDF, particularly for the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean.	0.7610645220755309
All this should make it possible for us, apart from the Objective 1 appropriations and also with them, to confirm the role of 'active frontier' of the Union.	0.8593700272019571
I adopt and wholeheartedly support this political objective that the seven most remote regions of the Union are actually active frontiers of the Union, even if, or precisely because, they are remote and located in other regions of the world where we must bring our influence and our action to bear.	0.846587411279563
Another point: the coordination between INTERREG, PHARE, TACIS and MEDA.	0.5953071026447345
It is true, once again, and I accept this objectively, that there are still real legal problems.	1.0099831919996032
I do not want to minimise these, but progress is being made as far as strand A cooperation with candidate countries is concerned, even if the problems related to the management procedures and to the scale of the projects still remain.	0.879673791832848
The Commission must continue along these lines.	0.6996139359292948
I am making a personal commitment to do so.	0.5343286945456371
An initial joint PHARE/CIP committee is to meet in February to assess this coordination, and let me confirm my attentiveness and availability with regard to this, together with my colleagues and fellow Commissioners Verheugen, Patten and Poul Nielson.	0.6699224727488581
Finally, on the subject of technical assistance, on which your rapporteur and several of you commented. It goes without saying that the Commission will adhere to the terms of Article 23 of the general regulations regarding technical assistance, if it is indeed assistance intended to be an instrument useful to structural policy in general.	1.015219326176273
According to the general regulations, however, any technical assistance scheme which can claim a connection with a Community initiative must be proposed under Article 20, and not Article 23.	0.8852440356140778
This means that the ceiling of 0.25% mentioned in Article 23 does not apply with regard to this type of technical assistance.	0.694578513430376
I attach great importance, ladies and gentlemen, in a spirit of discipline and transparency, to our nonetheless retaining some financial strands for matters relating to the exchange of experience and information, and not to propaganda, and to the implementation of networks ensuring good communication of best practice within the Union.	0.8918685288281221
My conclusion regarding INTERREG, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is that these Community initiatives for which I am responsible fulfil a real need and everything that has been said is proof of this. They also foreshadow a real European regional planning policy within our enlarged Union.	0.8669074461075549
The Commission attaches the greatest importance to this, just as you yourselves do.	0.6472507204864502
I remain at your service in order, when the time comes, to present the report of previous planning which you request, but also to keep you informed regularly as to the implementation of these initiatives in the course of the new planning.	0.9505335479409226
Repeating my thanks to each and every one of you, and also particularly to Arlene McCarthy and Francis Decourrière, I should like to point out that these two initiatives lie within a financial framework with which you are familiar: only EUR 700 million for URBAN, but this is better than nothing; EUR 4 billion 800 millions for INTERREG.	0.8052926362358523
So we are working within this framework and not outside it.	0.7032177526913604
On the subject of these two initiatives, then, with the light they cast on future strategic and political thinking regarding regional planning and on future financial perspectives, let me express our great interest in this constructive dialogue with the European Parliament and its committees.	0.806581730252569
Everything that I have just said, ladies and gentlemen, demonstrates that the Commission is resolved to taken the views of Parliament into account.	0.745836418729761
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like firstly to thank Mr Procacci for his report.	0.7361991360346193
However, I should also like to extend thanks to the various committees involved and Parliament as a whole for the broad support which they have given the LEADER+ initiative.	0.9843479834126652
This initiative should give the countryside new impetus to develop and test new and original ideas, ideas which it is then intended should at a later stage be incorporated in the general programmes as models.	0.6647259087571701
I am also pleased that Parliament essentially supports the Commission' s view that LEADER+ should be applied in all rural areas, that overriding priorities should be introduced and that, above all, active cooperation and networking between rural areas should be encouraged.	0.7243953188527706
In addition, I note that Parliament shares the Commission' s view that the preferred form for implementing LEADER+ is the use of global grants.	0.7164246564155302
Turning now to some of the individual questions raised here today, I can also confirm that we wish to have the widest possible partnership and participation in LEADER+.	0.9351619156664157
The various groups, be they environmental organisations or groups concerned with employment, have the possibility of taking part in drafting the Commission directives.	0.7680948833947349
And there will not be less funds available than in the current period either; there will be more.	0.8354094362125315
I should also like to remind you that the idea of setting up an observatory is nothing new.	0.6750782303835138
There was also an observatory under LEADER I and LEADER II.	0.44625632350455535
It has one purpose only and that is precisely to maintain active networking between the individual LEADER groups.	0.6293306065496701
The cost of this observatory is not permitted to exceed 2% of the LEADER budget.	0.7118878074440942
As far as the possibility of having projects containing training initiatives is concerned, I might point out that this is precisely a point which we have now integrated into the new rural development policy, which means, in our view, that it is no longer necessary to do this as part of LEADER.	1.1684616978572406
I now come to the content of the report.	0.6115342889913281
In point 14, Parliament calls on the Commission to submit an evaluation report on LEADER II immediately.	0.8304225795791875
I should simply like to point out that this does not make very much sense at the present time because, as you know, it is still possible - and in fact will be until the end of 2001 - for LEADER II funds to be disbursed.	0.9288200537287082
We therefore think that it would be more sensible to wait until the programme' s conclusion before carrying out the evaluation.	0.7261419558685182
We will obviously do this and will also forward a report to you on it.	0.6710696737104734
In point 18, Parliament suggests publishing a compendium of examples of successful initiatives.	0.5440644336712397
In response I can only say that this already exists.	0.8357318306197182
It has already been compiled by the Commission and I can make a copy available to any Member of this House who is interested.	1.033897331408942
In point 21, Parliament stresses that the guidelines in LEADER+ now need to be adopted quickly so that the programmes can start.	0.9392232234001934
I can only fully share your concern.	0.5783444089010192
As soon as the opinion is adopted here in Parliament, the guidelines for LEADER+ will again be presented to the STAR Committee so that the Member States can confirm the provisional agreement which they gave on 14 November.	0.8528499263985749
I assume that the Commission will then be able to adopt the definitive version of the guidelines in March or April.	0.9912809940096579
And as soon as these are published in the Official Journal the remaining months - in fact six months - can be used to submit LEADER+ programmes.	0.9121188471049219
I believe that it is important to point out one thing: expenditure effected under LEADER+ is eligible from the time that the Commission programme starts running.	0.7803160864268041
For all programmes submitted before 30 April of this year it will be possible to backdate the beginning of the period of eligibility to 1 January.	0.6935502972204373
Finally, under point 20 the motion for a resolution contains seven specific proposals for amendments to the guidelines.	0.7824953687868395
Having given them thorough consideration, I can tell you that the proposals made under paragraphs 2, 4, 5 and 7 are acceptable to the Commission and are adopted.	0.8670852136695879
The proposal in paragraph 6 will also be partly accepted because it reaffirms that the time allowed for approving programmes under LEADER+ is a maximum of 5 months.	0.6331578335872269
The amendment proposed under paragraph 1 has, in our view, been overtaken by events because, following consultations with the representatives of the Member States in the STAR Committee, this point has already been reworded along the lines proposed by Parliament.	0.8471987496207406
That therefore leaves only the amendment proposed under paragraph 3.	0.36300602560784817
The Commission can only endorse this request because of course it corresponds precisely to what the Commission itself had originally proposed.	0.8912687443599108
I must add, however, that cooperation between our action groups and similar groups in third countries went too far for the Member States.	0.687890321898703
An amendment was therefore made in the committee, but the Commission will now again take account of Parliament' s concern in the revised version and table the guidelines in that form.	0.8660713006353985
It will also continue to fight for Member States' acceptance of this.	0.8390663090522651
I will comment briefly on the 13 amendments tabled.	0.34845128017295024
Here there are only three which the Commission cannot accept, Amendments Nos 3, 12 and 13.	0.7875895851949428
It can accept all of the others either in full or in essence.	0.6355237004027118
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an exceptionally fortunate circumstance that we are debating the EQUAL initiative in the European Parliament just at this time.	0.9642065867931332
Recently, because of political developments in Austria, there is growing unease within Europe. Political demonstrations are taking place as well as political dialogue.	0.8287326977422034
It is worth stressing that both Parliament and the Commission must put forward specific policies.	0.8898207912050659
We need specific proposals, both for legislation and for action programmes associated with the fight against discrimination and the formation of free and fair societies.	0.7713922314137053
So I will make brief mention of the package against discrimination and take this opportunity to ask the competent parliamentary committees to appoint their rapporteurs so that we can move ahead with the anti-discrimination package as soon as possible.	0.7240733030417046
I now come to the EQUAL initiative, which is, of course, based on Article 13.	0.7424795318559617
The EQUAL initiative relates to all forms of discrimination within the meaning of Article 13, namely the fight against discrimination based on race, gender, age, and special needs.	0.7849124394159575
I would particularly like to congratulate Mrs Stenzel, because her effort to reach agreement on the EQUAL initiative has proved exceptionally difficult and complex, both because some of the committees involved view the issue in a different light and because it is a very sensitive political issue.	0.978063179353896
The first comment, which has been made by many others too, is whether women should be mentioned separately.	1.0520308747283076
I agree that Article 13 contains something we have expressed our disagreement about, but that is how the Treaty stands right now and among the categories of types of discrimination, discrimination on the grounds of gender holds equal place.	0.7414533771013635
So on the basis of the Treaty as it stands today, the EQUAL initiative is structured in that way.	1.0786091518517684
I would like to remind you, however, that there is a special axis for the employment strategy which relates to women and that a special programme is being prepared, the fifth programme for equality between men and women.	0.8177581565105118
I have classified the issues raised by the honourable Members into four groups.	0.5368889986120955
Firstly, the enlargement of the thematic areas.	0.7705680084646394
As in employment strategy, there are four thematic areas: employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities, and we agree that those thematic areas should be enlarged in line with the European Parliament' s proposals.	0.7757320938768297
To answer the concern whether there is a risk that a country might concentrate all the funds on one of the categories suffering discrimination, I will say that the initiative states clearly that the Member States must submit one thematic category for each group that is suffering discrimination.	0.868637075498378
The second subject is flexibility and simplification.	0.3237681048367395
I agree with Mr Leinen that the wording of the initiative is indeed very difficult and hard to understand.	0.712743442031557
That is why the services are already trying to revise the text, simplify its structure and make its wording easier to grasp.	0.6276777124782076
As regards the subject of flexibility, we propose development partnerships and cooperation both at the geographical level where different kinds of groups would cooperate in a specific geographical area to combat discrimination in the workplace, and at the thematic level where, for example, cooperation could take place in a specific economic sector.	0.8265339936013505
This would allow Member States great flexibility to tailor development cooperation to their own particular needs.	0.5989458820572429
Of course, a prerequisite for that is cooperation between the Member States, and a network which will assist the exchange of experience.	0.9333938587591968
Finally, I would like to mention technical assistance.	0.7485381719268371
We are trying to arrange that there will be four categories for which funding is available.	0.4332951181285532
First, funding for preparation; second, implementation; third, mutual cooperation to ensure the exchange of experience, and fourth, technical assistance.	0.7506312044442089
Since there has been great involvement and concern about how technical assistance is to be provided, we must say that external offices will be used.	0.9143251921753573
As Mr Barnier too pointed out, it is impossible for all the work previously done by external collaborators to be done now by the Commission' s staff.	0.8505722454021218
The aim at national and European level is to establish large action groups by tender, with a full description of the project for which external assistance is to be requested. We would expect from each technical office a full description of the product so that the work can be monitored and appraised.	0.8812893736990793
I want to stress that it is extremely important to promote this specific initiative as quickly as possible, both for reasons of political timing and because we believe that it is important that it should begin as planned, in other words, we must be absolutely ready by the end of 2000.	0.9606815807858301
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6002529528362665
I shall convey your wish that the rapporteurs should be quickly appointed for the files you mentioned to my colleagues in the Bureau and to the appropriate committees.	0.6490234950529309
The debate is closed.	0.04146649521247962
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.	0.365184792222889
(The sitting was closed at 8.40 p.m.)	0.28527315918033974
Approval of the Minutes of the two previous sittings	0.7457473005024585
The Minutes of the sittings of Thursday 3 February and Monday 14 February have been distributed.	0.4104194108709127
The Minutes of 3 February were originally distributed in Brussels so perhaps this is why some Members did not receive them.	0.686461619779773
Are there any comments?	0.1201495129830156
(The Minutes were approved)	0.0864398819752701
Madam President, my habit is always to be here for the opening of the part-session on Monday afternoons at 5.00 p.m.	0.6970589159429321
Yesterday it was impossible for myself and many MEPs to be here, because the 2.15 p.m. Air France flight, which normally brings us here, was cancelled, with no explanation from the airline, and we therefore arrived very late.	0.9199372667493373
If Air France insists on boycotting the European Parliament, we should take measures to prevent this occurring again.	0.9443352945976484
Thank you, Mr Medina Ortega.	0.7750757784149402
I too wholeheartedly regret this situation.	0.2523551288547905
Would you be so kind as to write to me so that I have proof with which to tackle the competent authorities of both Air France and the French Government?	0.7614449575377366
This situation really cannot continue and we must therefore protest most strongly.	0.7491400204807772
Madam President, I had the same experience as Mr Medina Ortega yesterday.	0.9096074072754147
I feel that the French authorities - which have the honour of housing the European Parliament in Strasbourg - should be aware of their responsibility to ensure adequate connections with all the capitals of the Union.	1.0062241543652364
Absolutely, Mr Napolitano. Thank you.	0.7660346142253344
Madam President, off the subject of aeroplane delays, I wish to apologise for the absence yesterday of my colleague in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Caroline Lucas, who is a British Member.	0.6903314261958985
She could not be here because she was arrested yesterday morning during an anti-nuclear demonstration in Glasgow.	0.5113069140851673
Although her identity was noted and her position as a Member of the European Parliament was very apparent, she was still held in custody all day.	0.733439173543528
I regard this as absolutely unacceptable and would ask you to contact the British authorities in order to ensure that this does not happen again and that Mrs Lucas receives an apology. I have written to you in this respect together with my colleague, Mrs Hautala.	0.8451755596675098
Thank you, Mr Lannoye.	0.8387380269768563
I have received your letter and have already contacted the British Permanent Representative.	0.536907087336325
Madam President, I should like to make a request in connection with today' s vote which I started to make yesterday during the debate on the EQUAL report.	0.8686095563890845
I should like the vote on the Community EQUAL initiative to be postponed because we need a bit more time to negotiate an important point.	0.9375323694463694
I am optimistic and quite relaxed and confident about the vote; we shall gain broad support for this opinion on EQUAL.	0.6814625507323123
We just need a bit more time to work out the details on the asylum question and I would therefore request that the vote be postponed from this morning.	0.7198625360428691
Madam President, to follow on from the point that Mr Lannoye made: Mrs Lucas was arrested just outside Glasgow for protesting against the Trident base at Faslane.	0.7283034015119044
I have a lot of sympathy with that protest.	0.6646782511003047
I have, however, no sympathy for Mrs Lucas trying to hide behind her Parliamentary immunity.	0.5470631490384287
I have also been arrested for protesting at Faslane.	0.6878045934464481
I did not hide behind any immunity.	0.4338018134586925
I took the punishment that came to me.	0.3949873447341711
Mrs Lucas should do the same.	0.3819267771819224
Madam President, I would like to comment on the request Mrs Stenzel has made to postpone the vote on the Community initiative EQUAL until tomorrow.	0.7797630083229542
In fact, this initiative was the subject of a very lively debate in committee, and, given that it is a major Commission proposal, which refers to the agreements we reached last year, I consider it admissible.	1.067258847066659
We agree with Mrs Stenzel that the request to postpone the vote is admissible in the interests of achieving the greatest possible agreement between the groups, so that Parliament can express its position on this initiative with the broadest majority possible.	0.7639730092069699
Does anyone want to speak against Mrs Stenzel' s request, as supported by Mrs Ghilardotti?	0.6690866472433296
If not, then we will proceed to the vote.	0.5994752428878568
(Parliament approved the request)	0.2592479978585684
Madam President, under Rule 29(4) you should be kept informed by political groups of any Members who have joined a new political group or who have left a political group.	0.7244610164256734
Have you received any notification of any Members leaving the Group of the European People's Party or does the Austrian People's Party continue to sit in that political group?	0.7096337749260521
Mr Corbett, I have not received any notification.	1.1385490374057265
Madam President, I am amazed at Mr Corbett' s reaction.	0.7240620156605814
He should find other ways of raising his profile than expressing views on such matters here.	0.345696092695551
We are solidly with our Austrian friends who have proven to be good Europeans in the past.	0.42211040344177
They have our full support.	0.3150710725313806
(Applause)	-0.0
Agenda	-0.0
With regard to the agenda for Thursday, following a request made yesterday in plenary, I propose extending the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance by half an hour to 6.00 p.m. when the vote will take place.	0.8057213202499178
(Parliament gave its assent)	0.038249974869252856
Commission's strategic objectives and legislative programme	0.3142060242583649
The next item is the joint debate on the Commission statements on its strategic objectives for the coming five years and the annual legislative programme for 2000.	0.7659049762716509
I therefore immediately give the floor to the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi.	0.7945436551885741
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a five-year programme is an extremely important undertaking, and this is why I preferred that you be given the unabridged text of the speech, which is available in four languages.	0.8848196475371445
To respect my speaking time, I will confine myself to referring only to the broad outlines of my programme: a programme for the dawning of a new legislature and a new century, when it is right and proper to see Europe in a broader perspective, a Europe which is currently in a paradoxical situation.	0.9858060679342127
Let us remember that for half a century, Europe has provided us with peace, security and freedom and a united Europe has also contributed to giving us a period of unprecedented prosperity.	0.7213098012098067
We are now seeing the beginning of a strong recovery, which it appears may even be sustainable for a good while yet if we are prudent with our policies.	0.8739804011996797
This recovery is the logical consequence of the efforts we have made, but it comes at a price: it follows the restructuring of public accounts in European countries, which have kept inflation under control with a policy wisely intended to control costs and increase productivity in a Europe that has begun a vigorous restructuring of its own industries, banks and public services, even though this process is not yet complete and still has a long way to go.	0.8617904901023522
Nevertheless, despite these aspects, European citizens are disappointed and concerned: by unemployment which is not falling quickly enough; by a Europe trailing behind in technology, and seemingly falling even further behind, and in particular a scientific sector which is starting to lag a long way behind too; by the European institutions which appear distant and do not seem to be in step with the times, starting with the Commission itself.	0.9299097097162479
The crisis in the Commission was, in fact, a crucial point in the relationship between Europe and its citizens, and the low turnout at the European elections was a worrying indication of this.	1.0553274094542149
Even stronger still, however, is the sense of insecurity, the feeling of being unprepared in a new world that is moving forwards, a world which is completely changing, where globalisation will even end up changing our points of reference.	0.8077586760046925
This is not the first time this has happened: Europe was once confronted with a similar transformation, an explosion of its markets, a change in its points of reference and a different view of the world.	0.8919300475094061
I am referring to the sixteenth century when the discovery of America turned everything upside down.	0.363943913982367
Some countries - such as France and Spain - managed to meet the challenge, giving rise to great nation States; other countries - such as Italy - did not meet this challenge and lost all the headway that they had accumulated during the first part of that millennium: headway in science, technology, economic progress, defence structures and military organisation, philosophy and literature.	0.6863098969333026
Today, Europe is facing a similar challenge, and we know that, just as history has been unforgiving in the past, it will not be forgiving in the present.	1.0425398259915148
In this context of wholesale change, and in order to prevent our nation States vanishing again, in the wake of globalisation which is creating hitherto unprecedented scales and challenges, Europe needs to be economically strong, because globalisation demands unity, because every day we hear news of new agreements at world level and news of changes at European level too.	0.8229546064388897
But more vital still is a Europe that feels strong in the political arena.	0.7009451524795629
In years past, the single market and the single currency have been the pivotal point of our actions, the mainstay of European life.	0.8734004710071824
Today, the new frontiers of European integration are political frontiers: common foreign and security policy, justice and internal security, and - to a lesser extent - the crucial question of the fundamental political values on which our coexistence is based.	0.9439933727764742
The Commission has therefore adopted the strategic programme for 2000-2005, a programme that was immediately sent to the European Parliament and with which you are already familiar, so I will not go into detail about it now.	1.086926034848087
Some of you may find it lacks detail, but no political structure sets out detailed five-year programmes.	0.7383542000175948
This is the European Union, not the Soviet Union.	1.1294487566191218
Our programme highlights the major points of reference, the major areas for action: firstly, the development of new forms of governance for Europe; secondly, extension and enlargement of the area of peace, freedom, and security; thirdly, the launch of a new stage in the growth of the economy; fourthly, safeguarding and improving quality of life.	0.8426381140315237
These will be our major guidelines for action over the next five years.	0.45492053493393136
With regard to the first area - new forms of governance for Europe - you already know that the Commission has undertaken to produce a White Paper and not a full legislative text since, in the light of major issues which are changing the structure of the way we interact, the Commission is first of all preparing for a debate; we will subsequently discuss the content with you; this will give rise to a policy document, and finally, a legislative document.	1.0361203062862339
This is an effective, transparent way to proceed and involve all the European institutions and the citizens of Europe.	1.0319969745226898
This White Paper is a response to the challenges that enlargement is forcing on us, an enlargement that is forcing us to rethink the workings of all our institutions, rethink our very policies - all our policies - and above all rethink what we must continue to do at Union level when the Member States number 25 or 30, and what will be the best thing to do at individual State level, at regional level and at local government level.	0.8960589477862917
But it is not only enlargement that is urging us towards this rethink: as I said a few moments ago, it is also economic and political globalisation itself.	0.966074805734549
We must govern Europe in such a way as to make us more efficient, to bring us closer to the citizens and to encourage everyone to get involved, starting with the important issue of the involvement of women.	0.8379332883089403
One of the main differences in the comparison made recently between Europe and the United States was not so much job mobility or risk capital, as women' s involvement in economic life, an issue that has much more prominence in the United States than in Europe. This is a field where Europe has, nevertheless, always been in the vanguard.	0.9156842127726327
We therefore need to reflect on this at length and with an open mind, and all the institutions - Commission, Parliament, Council - will have to consider their own roles and their own policies.	0.9796313538436995
We shall therefore get straight back to work on this White Paper, although in order to finish it, we shall have to wait for the results of the Intergovernmental Conference, and it will therefore not be ready until spring 2001.	0.9884207217199391
It will not be a philosophical Paper, but a practical Paper, full of focused proposals.	0.9747710488972583
We - the Commission - are the first to know that we must have a total rethink, and we shall therefore do two things: we are, and will continue to be, fully committed to internal reform, and we shall rethink our policies in detail.	1.2640905182169013
I have asked all the Commissioners - and I shall ask them once again in a still more analytical way - to pinpoint all the activities that we can forgo.	0.9692992046174016
The Commission must define what its fundamental activities are, what it must concentrate on and shed its non-essential activities, thereby freeing up new resources and ensuring a more correct and co-operative relationship with individual countries, regions and local communities.	0.6775341954591267
So we shall be freeing up new resources, but - I fear, and I want to state this before Parliament - the time will come when these new resources that we are already freeing up will, in turn, be insufficient in terms of allowing us to address our new tasks: I am thinking of enlargement, the new sector of justice and home affairs, health issues and environmental matters.	0.9793037841711891
When that time comes, when we have used up all our resources, I shall not hesitate to come here before you to request further resources, but what I am saying now is that if we are not given these necessary resources, we shall have to refuse to take on any new duties because the available resources will not be commensurate with the new tasks that we will be taking on.	1.0849407170452174
As for internal reform, you well know how committed my Commission has been to this since day one.	0.728137324069843
I know full well that we will not be able to achieve any political objective if the Commission does not undertake vigorous and comprehensive internal reform, if it does not become more efficient, if it does not increase efficiency in all sectors, starting with the sector in which the worst backlogs have built up in the past - external aid.	0.8501004414976732
Providing aid rapidly, when it is needed, saves human lives; in many cases providing it late is worse than not providing it at all.	0.6841993613319587
When I speak about external aid, my thoughts immediately turn to the Balkans. There is cause for hope thanks to the commitment of our workers on the ground, an extraordinary commitment given our organisational problems.	0.8204743184796667
My thoughts also turn to Bernard Kouchner' s efforts, of the stability pact that we all vigorously support with total dedication, but I also think of new events, such as Croatia, where the situation has changed in a few weeks: the European institutions immediately opened the way to dialogue with this country and received the news knowing full well that the only way to resolve not only Bosnia' s problems, but more particularly Serbia' s problems is to throw a curtain of democracy around Serbia.	0.9408978951923047
This is the new element that we must help to bring to the Balkans.	0.984821952475502
We must increase our efficiency in this area. We must reopen the Danube to boats.	0.9088099092729028
It is contradictory to offer aid to Romania and Bulgaria yet leave these countries unable to harness their greatest resource.	0.35952330298354124
We must decontaminate the river and, in view of this, over the next few days the Commissioner responsible for the environment will be putting forward specific plans to monitor this serious problem.	0.8629441581329181
We have done a lot in the Balkans: the new European Reconstruction Agency for Kosovo, the Balkans Task Force and new regulations to speed up procedures.	1.0342878576130696
Nevertheless, we definitely have to do more.	1.0606269471915573
We must liberalise trade within the region and between the region and the European Union; we must contribute to building infrastructural links that will end its centuries-old isolation; we must intensify efforts to build a democratic, pluralist society in these countries with institutions, public structures, police forces and a structured civil society, but, above all, we must press these countries to work together in the context of a united region, as regards both politics and the economy.	0.8914989993557118
If we do not do this, we shall have failed in our duty.	0.942696794413973
Remember that the Marshall Plan was not effective simply because of the scale of its resources: it was even more effective because it made us Europeans work together towards a new horizon; it gave us a fresh outlook in terms of our politics and our economy.	0.6874255019059666
This is what we need to do for the Balkans.	1.0365732938276802
Europe must prove - in the Balkans and the rest of the world - its ability to extend the area of security, peace and freedom and its ability to take a leading role on the international stage.	0.98192583996531
We are clearly, once again, returning to enlargement, which must be put into practice in tandem with the extension of the area of security, peace and freedom.	0.7395171025411356
We have made many promises in this regard, but I believe we shall succeed in keeping our promises even though we have a very delicate path to tread.	0.96747967259559
Indeed, enlargement, which will be with us for our five years in office and beyond - I am referring to the aspirations of applicant countries - must hinge on concrete, objective criteria, and also on reassuring public opinion in the countries involved and, to an even greater degree, public opinion in our own Member States.	0.9992874712912756
There will be friendship, calm, openness but also a certain strictness in the enlargement process.	0.5856743863252323
I repeat: we must reassure public opinion in those countries that wish to join but we need to provide public opinion in our own Member States with even greater reassurance.	0.8559268361521652
Our responsibilities do not stop at enlargement, or at the Balkans.	0.6923128191387826
There are certain other key issues: relations with Ukraine, relations with Russia, relations with neighbouring countries and more importantly, the important question of relations with the southern Mediterranean which will be a crucial point for European history, and for security and peace in Europe for future generations. In this regard, we have a responsibility towards the whole of Africa.	0.9875234439820901
In recent times, Africa has raised hopes and has received offers of help, but nothing tangible has yet been achieved. In recent years in Africa, we have not seen a shift from totalitarian regimes to democracy, but quite the contrary - a shift from democracy to totalitarian regimes.	0.8754279166679723
Africa is, for us, a worrying topic for discussion. We therefore have another duty at international level, which has already been proposed by the Commissioner responsible for trade: the undertaking to relaunch the Millennium Round and to take on some fundamental problems affecting the poorest countries, not just in terms of writing off debts, but also via the unilateral opening-up to trade with the poorest countries in the world, with a great deal of willingness on our part, which we had already proposed prior to Seattle but which we could not put into practice.	1.0368171016712129
We need to provide alternative answers, otherwise episodes such as those seen in Seattle will be repeated over and over and will come to hamper one of Europe' s positive roles in history.	0.6756291536038947
All over the world, Europe' s actions must be guided by a deep respect for the principles of freedom and respect for the rights of individuals and minorities.	0.8542914961591578
We should remember that we, the European Union, are a union of minorities: we are all a minority within Europe.	1.0322411507530955
There are concerns even within the Fifteen, concerns which may even surface again in the next decade.	0.799015550096818
I am referring to the situation in Austria, where the Commission has remained true to its role, being duty-bound to work towards the cohesion of the Union, but also the unwavering guardian of the Treaties, ready to punish every minor breach of the principles of democracy, law and respect for minorities.	0.8843380927753827
Some people have criticised me over the congratulatory message I sent to Chancellor Schüssel.	0.3954678561682335
My message to you is: do not take the necessary and proper courtesies of form to mean that I have been less firm in the content.	0.796230097659691
Reread the letter: The reference to the fundamental values of the Union is taken - and this is more than mere coincidence - from Article 6 of the Treaty, I repeat, Article 6 of the Treaty.	0.9659580868267451
I would also ask you whether you believe that any other European head of government has ever been reminded of these principles by the Commission when they were elected.	0.848702773962024
This is what we wish to do: maintain our role as a supranational structure, maintain the role conferred on us by the Treaties, but also be unwavering on principles and make judgements based on facts.	0.7421324057904214
Last November, the Commission tabled a proposal for an anti-racism directive.	0.8610931358072987
I would ask the Council to adopt it swiftly and I would ask Parliament to help us with this action which will further strengthen the fundamental bases of our social cohesion.	0.9328060706379937
I will quickly conclude by mentioning the last two points of our programme: the economy and quality of life.	0.7863416487909667
I have already talked about the economy: we well know which basic ingredients will set Europe on the path towards a lasting recovery which will in turn create more jobs.	0.6124571599507738
We must continue to keep inflation under control, proceed with liberalisation, ensure more competition, encourage the dissemination of information technology and all new technologies; push forward with science, and push back scientific boundaries, and develop an appetite for being at the cutting edge of science.	0.6145838011596018
The forthcoming Lisbon Summit on these issues - dissemination of technology, employment - will be a decisive summit.	0.8595092050649495
It has taken four years for us to be in a position to hold a summit of this kind.	0.8540728194440602
We are at last holding it and cannot let this opportunity slip through our fingers.	0.5777016184119778
Finally, our last commitment is to improve quality of life.	0.8408282066137287
We have opened this chapter with the White Paper on Food Safety: we now need to make significant headway in the environment sector.	0.753220199138101
The Erika oil slick and the contamination of the Danube demonstrates the pressing need for European scale intervention to safeguard the environment.	0.5886251726567546
The time has come to discuss, and then establish, a body for emergency civil protection in Europe.	0.8630051033104781
All too often we find ourselves calling for this after a disaster has occurred.	0.6293123124111658
I think it would be appropriate to begin thinking about these things before disasters happen.	0.6146138535912636
These are the challenges that we - the Commission but also all the other European institutions - are facing.	1.0461770776935866
How will we judge, ladies and gentlemen, Madam President, the five years of our mandate?	0.6448309430282
How are we going to assess the results of these five years?	0.6445672973722189
I do not know, but one benchmark we could certainly use is the challenge we must take up together.	1.0074463660354553
Let us take a very simple parameter: turnout at the next European elections.	0.4595726484660855
If it is higher than at the previous elections, it will mean that we have successfully met our challenge.	0.9229148140182939
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are faced with all these major political challenges, but precisely because of the recovery that is now underway, we are also faced with major opportunities.	0.8800838722316288
This, ladies and gentlemen, could be the decade of Europe. Indeed, I would say that this must be the decade of Europe.	0.9441264466571433
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats welcomes this debate and we welcome the fact that the Commission submitted a document so that we could prepare for the debate.	0.8360781993108399
We also welcome the conclusions which we find in this document.	0.536398464122523
And we welcome the broad outlines of the speech which President Prodi has just given.	0.6054825286228046
We read in the conclusions in the document that the five-year term of office of the Prodi Commission will be a time of major changes.	0.8832754918828202
Europe will press ahead with integration; at the same time the Union will start an enlargement process which will, in the end, reunite our continent.	0.769218187360523
A demanding, ambitious, perhaps even prophetic task and we wish you every success, Mr President of the Commission.	0.677629771895831
However, we consider that the present is the basis of the future and we shall only be able to shape the future if we prove our worth in the present.	1.0056074868470568
I say that in all earnestness and I have chosen my words carefully.	0.7776303622869253
I refer to the current debate on the present conflicts in the European Union.	0.8203263139049636
We in the European Union are one Community.	0.8949558575603483
We belong together, even when there are problems.	0.8995888878320283
Now is not the time to isolate but to unite and to complete together the task of unifying Europe.	0.651359251953131
Mr President of the Commission, you have represented and defended the European Parliament time and again over recent weeks.	0.7787520748410016
You have seen yourself as the guardian of the Treaties, and that is indeed your role.	0.788024371400487
For that and for the letter to the Federal Chancellor of the Republic of Austria which you mentioned, we expressly respect, acknowledge and support you.	0.7669641478367717
(Applause)	-0.0
Mr President of the Commission, our objectives are one and the same: we want a strong Europe in the twenty-first century, a democratic Europe which is able to act.	0.9126254288235914
A Europe which defends its values of human dignity and democratic rule of law both internally and to the outside world and, at the same time, looks after its global interests with dignity, patience and convincing self-confidence.	0.6260579188324107
Europe' s message, the European Union' s message to the world should not be one of arrogance or even European nationalism, no; it must be one of cooperation, partnership and peaceful development.	0.892308173218295
Globalisation gives us the chance to shape the world, which is becoming smaller and smaller, as a world of peaceful competition and solidarity.	0.8356395676141549
Seen in this light, globalisation is more of an opportunity than a danger, more of a coming together than a segregation, more mutual enrichment than separation.	0.6665896155650283
But we also know that we can only shape the huge challenge of globalisation together as Europeans.	0.8665560472997507
Globalisation is not only an economic process, it is also a cultural process, which is why we say: we want partnership in the world, we do not want the clash of civilisations which many are predicting, we want partnership, a meeting, exchange and peace.	1.0772061981323815
But we also say: we want to defend this European Community of tolerance, which is why a common foreign, security and defence policy is so important.	1.0553805492717605
Negotiations with six central European countries are starting today, bringing the European family a step closer together.	0.5538649837670884
We agree with what you said about the Barcelona process.	0.6925438379867344
All the countries in the Mediterranean area must acknowledge human dignity, democracy and the rule of law.	0.5904987071779744
