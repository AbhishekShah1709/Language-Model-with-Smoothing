The publication of the CONSORT Statement was aimed at the improvement of the quality of research reports of randomized controlled clinical trials.	0.5762595129334206
It contains the most important standards of high quality research.	0.640875068370371
Although originally meant for randomized studies only most aspects of this statement can be applied to other kinds of clinical studies.	0.5376120750808736
The demand for minimally invasive techniques and more comfort for the patient is becoming higher and higher.	0.7264261262860039
In the region of the ankle joint, it is therefore ideal to use the arthroscope for pathology.	0.7303370128198933
Indications for ankle joint arthroscopy are: soft tissue impingement, ligament instability, impingement in the syndesmosis, osteochondral lesions, loose bodies, arthrosis, and loose os trigonum of the talus.	0.515930924639118
In the subtalar joint the indications are rupture of the ligaments, loose bodies, and synovitis with soft tissue impingement.	0.6076946033634542
A new indication is arthroscopically assisted arthrodesis of the talar and subtalar joint.	0.36118519349559064
The reported high incidence of complications, especially in terms of neurovascular lesions, can be avoided by an exact knowledge of anatomy and use of non-invasive distraction of the joint.	0.7908876039687438
Although alexithymia is found in patients with various somatic disorders, it remains unclear whether it is really related to organic disease - as proposed by the founders of the concept .[125].	0.707302035187277
As the interplay between the experience of emotion and possible adverse effects on health is a fundamental tenet of psychosomatic medicine, alexithymia remains an interesting concept to be further explored, especially concerning (1) possible pathways linking emotion to physical illness and (2) the neurobiologic basis of emotional information processing.	0.5926035360214071
Compared to the intense international discussion on the subject, in Germany there are still many doubts concerning alexithymia: while some clinicians question the validity of the whole concept, psychiatric and psychosomatic researchers seem unsure about alexithymia's role in their search for a physiological basis to the link between emotion and physical disease.	0.6509272145446959
Our review deals with the empirical literature concerning that possible association and tries to tie in their data with modern, neurobiologically founded insights into emotional information processing within the brain.	0.37109920027948595
In the etiopathology of tension type headache, vascular and autonomic disorders are discussed.	0.5477678686415077
Fifteen patients with chronic tension type headache according to the criteria of the IHS were investigated using the TCD-ergometer-test - a method used to evaluate the myogenic mechanism of cerebrovascular autoregulation - and the results were compared with the findings in fifteen healthy control subjects.	0.8438237234603667
An immunohistochemical and morphometric study was performed on bone marrow biopsies in 604 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) to compare morphological and clinical features and to evaluate effects of interferon (IFN) and chemotherapy.	0.8265132884360042
Following morphometry significant correlations were calculated between number of CD61+ megakaryocytes, including their precursors with fiber density.	0.4458408799352129
This finding is in line with the close functional relationship between megakaryopoiesis and fibroblasts regarding the complex pathomechanism of myelofibrosis.	0.37810215484894405
The latter was observed in about 28% of patients already at diagnosis.	0.7518504452907451
In a similar way, the frequency of CD68+ macrophages was correlated with the amount of Ret40f+ nucleated erythroid precursors, implicating an involvement of this cell lineage in iron turnover, hemoglobin synthesis, and degradation of the expelled nuclei from normoblasts.	0.5498671799251996
The (-D-galactosyl residue-expressing) Pseudo-Gaucher cells were detectable in 30% of pretreatment specimens.	0.6909269625261272
Moreover, significant associations were calculable between reduction in erythropoiesis or increase in fibers with clinical features such as hemoglobin level, percentages of myelo- and erythroblasts in the peripheral blood, and spleen size.	0.5435322031553126
These variables are in keeping with more advanced stages of CML.	0.3975265971672381
Based on our morphometric evaluations, a classification into three different histological subgroups: granulocytic, megakaryocytic, and myelofibrotic was carried out.	0.6109891320554789
This simplified staging system was correlated with corresponding sets of hematological data.	0.3301094242097066
Sequential biopsies in 173 patients with monotherapy by IFN, hydroxyurea (HU), or busulfan (BU) revealed a fibrogenic effect of IFN in contrast to a fiber-reducing property of HU.	0.48962339712625874
The dynamics of myelofibrosis and changes of major cell lineages during treatment were readily demonstrable by calculating corresponding indices.	0.41086443016773916
These included the ratios between quantitative differences of corresponding variables at repeated examinations and time.	0.3003536832687507
Thus, in patients with complete hematological remission following IFN administration, regeneration of erythropoiesis was found to be accompanied by an increase in the total number of CD68+ macrophages, including activated subpopulations.	0.6663730231501429
Histological subgroups showed a transition from a (nonfibrotic) granulocytic and megakaryocyte pattern to the myelofibrotic subtype in about 40% of patients.	0.5692435338650581
This change was opposed to a numerical reduction in the myelofibrotic subtype which occurred in 17 patients (36%), but predominantly in those under HU therapy.	0.5656547848897407
In conclusion, the striking heterogeneity of bone marrow features in CML warrants a careful morphological evaluation of trephine biopsies and appropriate means of processing to achieve relevant correlations with clinical data and, thus, allows a more elaborate insight into the dynamics of the disease process.	0.6487174803933983
Computer-aided analysis of the results of the intrathecal infusion test using our mathematical computation leads to simplification of this investigation, and therefore normal pressure hydrocephalus is more easily diagnosed.	0.7438734335221091
Simultaneous measurement of resistance and compliance during a single investigation allows the exertion of the patients to be minimized.	0.6584665684362172
In contrast to classic methods it is not necessary that the ICP reaches a plateau.	0.6658254917498975
Our mathematical method diverges with the description of a pressure-dependent slope of the function for the resistance from the static examination models.	0.5223460698238767
For that we are able to take the non-linearity of the cerebrospinal fluid resorption into consideration.	0.4377691053837531
The intrathecal infusion test is a reliable diagnostic method for measuring resistance and compliance in patients suspected of having normal pressure hydrocephalus.	0.5721619838162199
Primary medullary nailing of femoral fractures is burdened by the risk of central and pulmonary complications in patients with polytrauma, especially in conjunction with craniocerebral or thoracic trauma.	0.5843607783334063
This also applies to unreamed medullary nailing.	0.19962346445206622
Primary treatment with external fixation necessitates secondary surgery with an altered procedure, the timing of which is not predictable.	0.6550703499911186
Plate osteosynthesis with anatomical repositioning of the fragments and rigid fixation is a technically demanding procedure, but can lead to fragment necrosis due to fragment denudation.	0.6805755232262756
In a prospective study conducted from 1 September 1994 to 30 June 1996 on 17 polytraumatized patients (average ISS: 30 points), simple femoral stem fractures (A-1 to B-3 of the AO-classification) were stabilized by elastic plate osteosynthesis using biological technique.	0.6653532297890346
While cautiously preserving the periosteal and muscle connections to the bone, a plate is inserted as a bridge without any interfragmentary compression.	0.4856678442643638
At least two to four holes are left free in the center of the plate.	0.5115764188249589
This allows micro-movements in the fracture gap without the risk of material fatigue.	0.5187870032471635

225 patients (74.4%) of this subselection were treated with balloonangioplasty only.	0.7272208536109148
It is not clear whether public health insurance will cover post exposure prophylaxis (PEP), whereby the question of costs being covered by private health insurance companies is not taken into consideration here.	0.5653044491286388
Regulations concerning prevention (§ 20 SGB V), precautionary medical services (§ 23 SGB V) and health examination (§ 25 SBG V) offer no legal basis for cost coverage.	0.6058991919660789
PEP is patient care in the sense of § 27 SGB V. However, this particular treatment has not yet been adapted into public health insurance financial guidelines because the federal committees have not yet made appropriate recommendations.	0.5772473630782373
This should be achieved soon, in order to eliminate legal ambiguities in this area.	0.5371697583512909
The principles of the so called "new methods of examination and treatment" legal construct may support cost coverage liability.	0.6756204791451003
On the whole, however, German-Austrian recommendations concerning indication and use of PEP must be formulated more concretely and unambiguously.	0.4616504912929518
If a doctor, in the case of an indication according to the German-Austrian recommendations, does not prescribe PEP, this would probably not be malpractice, because there are still many scientific questions to be answered.	0.8327057087212323
To clarify the functional mechanism of the Esmarch device in the treatment of sleep apnea, its effect on muscle activity during sleep was studied electromyographically with and without the appliance at the inferior head of the lateral pterygoid muscle, the genioglossal muscle, and the masseter muscle in 15 patients with sleep apnea syndrome.	0.7460675888593002
During the obstructive apnea the muscles showed significantly lower amplitudes than before the apnea.	0.38782892321312185
No significant decrease in the amplitude was observed during the central apnea, but, after the obstructive and central apnea, significantly higher amplitudes were seen than beforehand.	0.7502870013941215
The amplitudes rose after the placement of the appliance, and the amplitudes of the genioglossal and lateral pterygoid muscles during obstructive apnea increased significantly after the insertion of the appliance.	0.6353819602824332
The results suggest that the device can activate the masticatory and tongue muscle activity and indicate that the muscles activated with the appliance can prevent obstruction in the oropharynx.	0.5253237430817184
The Esmarch device not only helps avoid obstruction by mandibular protraction, but also affects function by activating the muscles.	0.48872238685597175

The prevalence in paediatric obesity is increasing in many industrialised and developing countries and growing to a world-wide medical and socio-economic problem.	0.41896953769446416
In a recent report of the WHO the world-wide epidemic of obesity was addressed as a problem of highest priority.	0.5703928549516697
Inadequate long-term results of weight reduction in children and adolescents and the increasing socio-economic burden to the health systems, as well as the high grade of persistence of obesity aggravate the problem and demand primary prevention efforts.Future directions of primary prevention measures could be the time of onset of obesity, the "early adiposity rebound", intrauterine malnutrition, weight gain during infancy, low energy expenditure in infants, familial adiposity, composition of food and modification of fat intake.	0.6515425091129023
Despite advances in the field of orthopedic surgery, necrosis of the femoral head still remains a serious problem.	0.5105860671225175
Under normal conditions magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) is the gold standard for early diagnosis.	0.732581071303904
Because of magnetic interference, this technique is not applicable in the diagnosis of posttraumatic necrosis with internal fixation, however.	0.7789245453659418
This seems to be an ideal indication for ossovenography: contrast medium is injected into the femoral head under X-ray control and the venous flow is documented.	0.7435842670386583
Furthermore, it is possible to get histological samples from suspicious areas.	0.5984654658070016
Ossovenography was performed in 12 patients and the results were compared with histological samples.	1.052327929901137
In every patient in whom necrosis of the femoral head was diagnosed by ossovenography (91.6 %), we also found necrosis on histological examination.	0.7079443099808537
In one patient in whom physiological flow was found, there was a corresponding absence of necrosis in the histological sample.	0.72609943076151
There were no complications during ossovenography.	0.682531290740057
The results suggest that ossovenography is a promising and reliable method for early diagnosis of necrosis of the femoral head in the presence of internal fixation devices.	0.6797488596555791
To evaluate patients with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death the analysis of ventricular late potentials, heart rate variability and baroreflexsensitivity is helpful.	0.6612994999904414
However, the prediction of malignant arrhythmic events cannot be performed with sufficient accuracy.	0.6471875933561186
For a better identification of high risk patients other methods are necessary.	0.623667666471814
In this study the impact of the chemoreflexsensitivity for the prediction of ventricular tachyarrhythmias was investigated.	0.6734437361869701
The results of a retrospective study concerning percutaneous catheter drainage of 62 intra-abdominal abscesses in 60 patients were demonstrated, including the procedure and complications.	0.7975368835793166
For the first access a thin needle was used to perform an aspiration biopsy under sonographic control.	0.6418712954737358
We placed a pigtail or van Sonnenberg catheter by Seldinger or trocar technique into the abscesses.	0.21431730847344155
The primary success rate of percutaneous drainage was 85 %.	0.5032751424022338
Complications occurred in 6.4 % of the cases with a mortality of 0 %.	0.9138059142717067
This method is an acceptable alternative to surgery for many patients.	0.5668493787775551
Ultrasound-guided percutaneous catheter drainage is the method of choice for uncomplicated abscesses, especially in the critically ill patient.	0.6721765477408885
Acute brain tissue damage or systemic illnesses can lead to local or diffuse brain edema and raised intracranial pressure (ICP).	0.49396611249272204
It is obvious that in all brain injuries additional factors (metabolic disturbances, hypoxia and hypercapnia, circulatory instability) aggravating brain edema and impairing recovery of viable neurons have to be treated immediately and consequently.	0.5201740411327996
Medical therapies for further treatment of elevated ICP depend not only on their mode of action and side effects but although on the specific illness.	0.6194526693652856
The different etiology and pathogenesis of developing brain edema and ICP elevation with either more local or generalized extension explain the different success of medical treatment strategies in severe head trauma compared to middle cerebral artery territory or complete hemispheric infarction.	0.555043937507309
An algorithm for treatment of postischemic brain edema in acute hemispheric infarction was developed.	0.5388932315569328
In an investigation of infection control methods for respirator systems in 89 randomly selected German intensive care units as a part of the NIDEP study (Nosocomial Infections in Germany - Surveillance and Prevention), it was found that respirator systems were exchanged daily in about 50% of the intensive care units.	0.6742711231968511
However, Craven et al.	0.29784544579070343
found that changing circuits (including tubing and exhalation valve and the attached humidifier) every 24 h rather than every 48 h was independently associated with the occurrence of nosocomial pneumonia.	0.5321838478364579
On the basis of these results and recent studies, the current situation in the literature was analyzed in order to make recommendations for exchanging ventilator circuits.	0.8233796549417404
The key function of the uterine cervix to maintain pregnancy is biochemically characterized by an increased synthesis of proteins (e.g., collagen), proteoglycans, and glycoproteins (e.g., fibronectin) as well as by well-defined interactions between these components of the extracellular matrix.	0.6009764167320919
In contrast to the slow phase of the cervical ripening process in late pregnancy, dilatation of the cervix during parturition requires the rapid formation and action of catabolic enzyme systems, leading mainly to collagen degradation and changes in its architecture but also to degradation of other fundamental matrix proteins.	0.6017551105611332
It has been suggested that an increased production of tumor necrosis factor- and interleukin-1, for example, induces an increased expression of endothelial adhesion molecules with subsequent extravasation of granulocytes in the cervical stroma and that the chemotaxis and degranulation of these cells within the stroma is triggered by an increase in interleukin-8 concentration.	0.6300656430223409
The proteases (e.g., matrix metalloproteinase-8) released after degranulation of neutrophilic granulocytes encounter an already destabilized (loss of decorin) collagenous fiber network.	0.35695946079937196
The clinical consequences of this basic research is to develop new concepts in a more causal treatment of cervical pathology during pregnancy and parturition.	0.5938246595005193

The rational of this study was to show that retroviral transduction of human osteoblastic cells is possible in vitro using the marker gene LacZ and the potentially therapeutic gene encoding for human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein (IL-1Ra).	0.5819527253256225
Different transduction techniques were combined to improve the rate of transduction in vitro.	0.5290087903316537
Methods: Osteoblastic cells were isolated from human spongious bone and cultured in vitro.	0.4457864635595767
The -galactosidase (LacZ) gene and the cDNA of IL-1Ra were introduced into the isolated cells by retrovirus mediated gene transfer.	0.5297358793153919
LacZ activity was determined by Xgal staining, IL-1Ra was measured quantitatively by ELISA.	0.4687700726329638
Results: The transfer of retroviral IL-1Ra led to IL-1Ra expression of 8614 to 10089pg IRAP/50000 cells/48h.	0.5488447394018491
By combining different techniques to improve transduction, the X-gal staining established a rate of transduction of 60%.	0.5645977336724239
Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that retroviral transduction of human osteobalstic cells is possible in vitro, and leads to high levels of the synthesized transgene product.	0.6112933416001847

Early pelvic stabilization, e. g., with external fixation, is recommended in these patients.	0.7034494792021998
Central retroperitoneal hematoma in the supra - or inframesocolic space should be treated surgically, as major vascular injuries are most likely in these patients.	0.7786965597314953
Duodenal or pancreatic injuries need surgical exploration in the majority of patients; the therapeutic spectrum ranges from simple sutures to pancreatoduodenal resection.	0.5599102785302895
The treatment of colon injuries depends on the degree of peritonitis and the severity of concomitant trauma.	0.5141394912967918
Early diagnosed injuries are suitable for primary repair, while deviation stomata or a Hartmann procedure with or without resection should be offered to patients with delayed diagnoses, peritonitis, or severe concomitant diseases.	0.6056607774537865
Long-lasting procedures should be abandoned in the emergency situation; in these severe cases, laparotomy should be aimed towards primary "damage control" and followed by definite surgery after stabilization of the patient.	0.7533147152079737
Surgery of the great veins inevitably began with the surgical treatment of injuries, often involving the femoral vein.	0.7382695168862421
Because of the famous case presented by Roux in 1813, the prevailing opinion until almost the end of the nineteenth century was that ligation of the vein made death inevitable, but that the only way to control severe hemorrhaging from a vein was to ligate the femoral artery.	0.5476718278299193
Zaufal's principle (1880) consisted in the ligation and resection of great veins of the body and limbs in order to prevent sepsis in suppurative processes.	0.5618316145451446
This surgical method was still being used in the first half of the twentieth century in patients with perforated appendicitis or puerperal fever.	0.6631943245076944

Complete tumor removal on both sides was then possible by a transmastoid-transcervical approach without any further functional deteriorations.	0.4653990957148495
Middle ear function was preserved on both sides by temporary ventral translocation of the posterior wall of the auditory meatus.	0.5815381706620636
As the sigmoid sinus and internal jugular vein had been ligated during initial previous surgery, venous drainage was tested one year later by angiography and compression of the remaining internal jugular vein.	0.57625047132565
A sufficient collateral circulation was found and permitted surgery on the second side.	0.4597449580920408
Intoxication is the monotone reaction of the CNS to consumed psychoactive substances.	0.4218918503765824
Intoxication-like conditions may also occur without taking drugs.	0.44526928890005274
We then use the term "ecstasy".	0.2834913059548824
Intoxication can follow typical or atypical course.	0.19869276411745385
The main symptoms are disturbances of consciousness and orientation and additionally changes of mood, affect, drive and initiative, train of thought and self-control.	0.4724322561297446
The diagnosis of intoxication differs from the diagnosis of psychosis because the latter continues its own course, occurs in the absence of psychoactive substances in the organism and always lasts longer than an intoxication.	0.4809629510553132
In a meta-analysis of 69 prospective and retrospective studies, we investigated the value of various surgical techniques in the treatment of lumbar disk herniations.	0.7096885495070222
Androgenetic hair loss is the most frequent reason for the topical application of hair-growth-promoting agents.	0.6366272202088935
Such preparations should arrest or even reverse androgen-induced hair follicle regression as well as prolonging the hair cycles, especially of the shortened anagen phase, and thus protect from increased hair loss.	0.5357609663004584
True evidence of drug effects on hair growth is problematic, since trichograms, the method chiefly applied by the manufacturers, fail to reveal every factor involved in the follicular activity, especially the duration of anagen stage.	0.6905566192329302
For example, an increase in the anagen rate does not always reflect a lengthening of the anagen stage, but may also be due to shortened hair cycles.	0.720980618183581
Accordingly, drug effects on hair growth should be investigated by methods that analyse the cell cycle kinetics.	0.5879294460454874
For this approach DNA-flowcytometry of the outer root sheath in plucked anagen hairs and of complete anagen hair bulbs taken by micropreparative techniques from scalp biopsies offers a reproducible method for quick and reliable evaluation of hair growth.	0.3631084222886439
The calcaneus pseudathrosis is rarly seen in clinical workday and we coundnit find any case be reported.	0.3262160205304966
In two casese the authors present the diagnosis and therapie of a non-union after a calcaneus fracture.	0.5667288704536536
The authors point especially at anatomical characteristics and biomechanical reasons and their meaning for aetiology of pseudathrosis after a calcaneus fracture.	0.3717800369485867
A general review of the results and technique of intraarterial chemotherapy in cases of breast cancer is given.	0.8219348214678462
The remission rate for untreated primary tumors is nearly 100%, for completely treated local relapses approximately 70%.	0.5392554663856653
The complication rate is quite low using an intraarterial well-tolerated cytostatic agent such as mitoxantrone.	0.46300391716659006
However, thromboembolism of the vertebral artery facing the internal mammary artery may occur.	0.5138035050549704
The indication for intraarterial chemotherapy should always be set by an interdisciplinary board.	0.5023442331863676
In the country city of Ansbach, Germany all cases of varicella-zoster virus infection seen by dermatologists, pediatricians and general practitioneers were registered over a period of 16 months, from February 1992 until May 1993.	0.5372605188286458
152 patients were clinically diagnosed with herpes zoster and 437 patients with chickenpox.	0.3763189471643563
The population-based incidence of zoster infections was 22.6 per 10,000 inhabitants per year, while the incidence of chickenpox was 42.4.	0.5925503725229581
There was a slight predominance of male patients with zoster.	0.5883679239449602
There was also a marked influence of age and sex, on the localization of the involved nerve segments.	0.7562898070839184
Zoster was seen in patients of all ages but there was a clear predominance in older patients.	0.7601387935849571
The peak of the disease occurred in the eighth decade.	0.8092843178483847
In patients with chickenpox, the sex ratio was equal.	0.6246365007234259
The disease typically occurs in children and we observed a predominance of the cases in the first decade.	0.9562224610836585
Paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes (PNS) are rare disorders of the nervous system that cannot be ascribed to metatastases or to destruction of vital systemic organs by the tumor or its treatment.	0.5666379485359269
Most frequently, PNS occur in association with small-cell lung, breast or ovarian carcinomas.	0.48486207933335557
The most frequent PNS is Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, which at the same time has the highest predictive value concerning an underlying carcinoma.	0.6107667568165203
PNS have been classified mostly under anatomical aspects but now are increasingly categorized according to specific antibodies.	0.37319073685207127
In certain neurologic syndromes (sensible and autonomic neuropathy, cerebellitis, limbic encephalitis, Opsoclonus-Myoclonus syndrome, Stiff-man syndrome, neuromyotonia, subacute amaurosis) specific autoantibodies are highly predictive for a neoplasm.	0.45833371114072313
Pathogenic relevance of these autoantibodies has been demonstrated only for antibodies against (1) voltage gated calcium channels (VGCC) in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, (2) voltage gated potassium channels (VGKC) in neuromyotonia, and (3) recoverin in cancer associated retinopathy.	0.6010310190168656
The present article deals with the neurological symptoms of PNS, associated tumors, and the relevance of specific antibodies for the diagnosis and pathogenesis of PNS.	0.8412756755034512
Ewing's sarcoma is a very rare tumor which has, however, attracted much oncological interest since the dramatic improvement of its prognosis under chemotherapy.	0.4351654560332163
Its histogenesis has been discussed controversially for a long time, including a possible origin in immature reticulum, myogenous, endothelial and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells.	0.6456243954921866
Repeated reports have also suggested a possible neuroectodermal genesis.	0.34871471956173256
Convincing arguments, however, have only been brought forward during recent years, since it was found that Ewing's sarcoma and malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumor share a common chromosome translocation 11;22.	0.6089468365095235
In the meantime this hypothesis has been strengthened by numerous cell biological analyses.	0.4270759218077766
There seems to be no clear border between Ewing's sarcoma and malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumors with definite neural differentiation.	0.4800386783494594
Histological differential diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma has been improved by immunohistological methods.	0.4593151981825036
In most cases, they can be distinguished from lymphoma (leucocyte common antigen, B and T markers) and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (muscle specific actin, desmin) without problems.	0.7129916566149687
Apart from that, it is possible nowadays to obtain antibodies against the MIC 2-protein, which is preferably expressed in Ewing sarcoma.	0.7239809083840975
The diagnostics of Ewing's sarcoma and the malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumor have considerably been enriched by the fact that the specific chromosome translocation t(11;22) can be proved molecular biologically.	0.5058693716532608
In contrast to the cytogenetic evidence, it is not necessary to establish cell cultures.	0.8307361812925846
Contrast enhanced (CE) magnetic resonance angiography affords angiographic depiction of extended vascular territories with high quality and diagnostic value.	0.4396598812705599
A prerequisite is the fast acquisition of a three-dimensional gradient-echo data set during the injection of a bolus of a T1-shortening contrast agent.	0.5141457983105938
We describe the dependence of the quality of CE-MRA on technical parameters of different MR-scanners and consider some fundamental facts and practical guidelines concerning the contrast agent injection.	0.4766766647605307
The present study gives a survey of radiological findings after surgical treatment of laryngeal and pharyngeal carcinomas, whereby the surgical procedures and the localisation of tumours found special consideration.	0.6628212681822719
Owing to advances in adjuvant therapy, the outlook for patients with primary malignant bone tumors has improved dramatically in recent decades.	0.5872237728734621
This applies both to improved survival and to increased limb salvage rates.	0.4590335881688209
The diagnostic strategies and a staging system for malignant bone tumors are outlined.	0.6579817470224825
Technical aspects of the standard limb salvage procedures, such as Tikhoff-Linberg resection at the shoulder, internal hemipelvectomy, proximal and distal femur resection and rotation plasty are presented.	0.5343294115998956
The use of soft tissue procedures such as flaps and the use of modular implant systems has reduced the complication rates of limb salvage procedures.	0.5056911820441796
In the future we hope to further improve prognosis and quality of life for such patients by the application of risk-adapted strategies for chemotherapy and surgery.	0.6758373557805101
In 10-30 % of cases, locoregional recurrence is accompanied by distant metastasis; a further 25 % develop distant metastasis within the year after diagnosis of recurrence.	0.6700166211704848
In treatment of recurrent tumor in the thoracic wall, axillary or supraclavicular disease surgery plays a major role.	0.6079981657391793
Since - another long-lasting courses occur even in the metastatic situation, recurrence is not an infrequent event, and therapy then needs a multidisciplinary approach.	0.7472829888890976
Surgical techniques such as local, myocutaneous or omental flaps and mesh graft transplantation are used to cover large defects after tumor resection.	0.4781451308713522
Additional and innovative modalities are combined in the management of this complex problem: locoregional or systemic chemotherapy, topical application of chemotherapy, certain radiation regimens and in otherwise resistant tumors the experimental use of photodynamic laser therapy (PDT).	0.49408260882281696
The most important goal hereby is to restore or at least maintain organ function and quality of life.	0.5833034538120093
In acute osteomyelitis of childhood a rapid diagnosis and initiation of antibiotic therapy is necessary in order to prevent late sequelae.	0.5956296648906384
Thus, diagnostic imaging plays a crucial role.	0.5495765984451545
If acute osteomyelitis is suspected in a child, imaging starts with conventional radiography in order to exclude other differential diagnoses.	0.5434710913103933
This is followed by sonography for the purpose of diagnosing a subperiosteal abscess or joint fluid from which the causative organism could be isolated.	0.4568376762142703
If the diagnosis is unclear, the next step should be either MRI or 99m Tc-MDP bone scan, depending on the possibility of clinical localization and the site of the suspected lesion.	0.6513677078593176
MRI is superior to bone scan in depicting the exact anatomy, which is extremely important in spinal osteomyelitis and preoperatively.	0.6283169710896838
The bone scan can show the whole skeleton in one examination and should be favored if there is no definite localization or in suspected multifocal osteomyelitis.	0.5180536891967618
Rarely scintigraphy with labeled white blood cells is indicated.	0.31359994883626674
The 67 Ga scan, however, should not be used in children because of the high level of radiation exposure.	0.8216927569989361
The different imaging modalities are described in detail and an imaging diagnostic workup is outlined.	0.588696772992151
In spite of all interdisciplinary efforts and functionally oriented operation procedures, there are still unsatisfying results in the treatment of cleft lip and palate (CLP) patients.	0.6148098569679333
Secondary corrections involve upper lip, nose, and palate (fissures).	0.4617252350454615
In some cases, it is necessary to reposition the complete maxilla.	0.6457867229936444
Finally, there are indications for speech improving measures and total septorhinoplasties.	0.6636488538908515
Dental treatment can be brought to a positive end by means of implant-borne prosthodontic work.	0.5606403632570616
In this paper, some of the anatomical and physiologic conditions and surgical procedures are described, which may serve as a basis for a functionally orientated treatment of sequelae after primary CLP care.	0.8396763315565327
Damage to the respiratory system caused by inhalation of toxic products of combustion and the subsequent development of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the main lethal factors in burns patients.	0.6349540721661469
Treatment with exogenous surfactant is one of the therapeutic options.	0.6121495998517639
However, no clinical reports have yet been published about this therapy.	0.6109709418914829
We report on two patients with burn injuries of second to third degree affecting 42% and 48% respectively of the total body surface plus inhalation injury complicated by ARDS.	0.6343225385303316
Both patients were treated with bovine surfactant (Alveofact).	0.5615552071131517
The therapeutic effects on oxygenation and pulmonary function were monitored.	0.5237812557706323
Intrabronchial application of surfactant by bronchoscopy during exhaustive conventional mechanical ventilation resulted in improved gas exchange with an increase in arterial O2 pressure (paO2); inspired O2 concentration (FiO2) was lowered and there was an improvement in lung compliance.	0.5416538367131261
Both patients survived this critical situation.	0.27644811786120577
We conclude that treatment with exogenous surfactant in postburn victims with ARDS is a promising therapeutic approach to improve the survival rate of these high-risk patients.	0.6937686942646321
The main aesthetic concern of patients with Angle class II deformities with skeletal deep bite - short face syndrome - is the short lower face.	0.7068429402457215
It is the orthodontist's task to correct this deformity insofar as possible.	0.4303273539408341
Depending on the extent, even orthodontists at the beginning of their training will recognize this.	0.6514145533918716
Since presurgical orthodontic treatment determines the kind and extent of the surgical procedure, the orthodontist has to plan the treatment in for individual case .	0.6187258807941012
It is the purpose of this article to demonstrate a concept of treatment for patients with class II deformities, skeletal deep bite, and a short lower face.	0.9489938357120781
Presurgical orthodontic treatment and the surgical procedure to correct the deformity are discussed.	0.8497004823696648
The treatment results show that it is necessary to leave or to create a certain curve of Spee, depending on the extent of the deformity, to achieve a satisfactory result in terms of to function, aesthetics, and stability.	0.7412866185166548
It can be concluded that it is only possible to reach the preset treatment goals with an exact diagnosis and the knowledge of the necessary preparation in combination with the surgical procedure.	0.8237052643723789
Adequate psychotherapeutic treatment of transsexual patients during the "real- life-test" is crucial for the outcome after sex reassignement surgery.	0.7044585972110028
Necessary modifications are discussed along the concept of "transsexual defense" and the interrelation of identity and disordered gender identity.	0.589387271024638
Usually therapeuts of transsexual patients, who decide over somatic sex reassignement, have to engage also in psychotherapy in a broad sense.	0.6327279427002774
Within the setting of the "administrative-psychotherapeutic split" the psychotherapist leaves the decision over admission to sex reassignement to a therapist specialised in gender identity disorders.	0.42263421544931723
In this setting patients have more time to develop insight and have better chances to explore other options and find individual solutions with regard to irreversible sex reassignement surgery.	0.41547426021947287
During recent years in the German federal social welfare system has been subject to several changes due to structural forms.	0.6079025216692449
The hospital sector - as an element of this system - has also been affected.	0.8750304635619466
Based on various legislation the financial framework has been reduced which has led to tendencies of economic limitation and rationalization.	0.3944237132957483
From this background considerable risk selection and changes in emphasis might result.	0.3785613714256103
Cost intensive patients with a high need for treatment are referred as quickly as possible and dicharged to outpatient services despite unknown domestic follow-up care.	0.5978922500796707
Mostly the elderly are affected.	0.3937470629802156
Medical rehabilitation can be found in this system at the cut between SGB V and SGB XI.	0.5718510404839351
However, this division raises problems and discussions concerning benefit payment (rehabilitation before nursing, priority of home, etc.).	0.4392524615397106
Right in rehabilitation the most important thing is an overlap of sectors.	0.4487451239295751
Various medical, nursing and other social supplies have to be put into a network to achieve an integral treatment of patients that focuses on the individual situation.	0.6260780069699959
In 1995 the Ethics Commission of the Medical University of Lübeck was asked to rule on whether a preimplantation diagnostic procedure (PID) could be performed on a husband and wife who were both carriers of the cystic fibrosis mutation  F508.	0.547165236349196
The couple had previously given birth to a child with cystic fibrosis and had twice terminated a pregnancy following prenatal screening.	0.4190449799299417
Ethically, the performance of a PID was certainly warranted for this couple.	0.5273317108166122
The risk of violating §§8 Section 1 and/or 2 Section 1 ("totipotent cells shall not be removed for diagnostic purposes") of the Law for the Protection of Embryos (ESchG) was judged to be nonexistent in written statements from two expert witnesses (Prof. K.V.	0.5997893607374939
Hinrichsen and Prof. H.M. Beier, both embryologists).	0.4931147268307508
In the view of the Ethics Commission, only §1 Section 2 ("an ovum shall be fertilized only for the purpose of inducing pregnancy") of the ESchG currently prohibits PIDs.	0.7110665142482109
In light of the social and biological arguments in favor of PIDs, however, the Ethics Commission questioned whether this section of the ESchG is still morally justifiable.	0.6147633316675916
A 38 year old male patient with a coarctation of the aorta was successfully operated using an ascending aorta-abdominal aorta bypass (AAAAB).	0.6018410165357558
The diagnosis of a severe postisthmic stenosis had been confirmed by aortography.	0.6348639854204254
Preoperatively the patient suffered from extreme hypertension and claudicatio intermittens.	0.3457997728453323
After prosthetic repair of coarctation, blood pressure became normotensive and claudicatio intermittens disappeared.	0.45477579496495635
In this report, we discuss various surgical techniques and the most important question concerning the optimal timing of surgical repair of aortic coarctation.	0.8502961461518426
Iatrogenic colonic perforation is a rare but very dangerous complication of colonoscopy.	0.5703870364660508
We report on eleven prospectivly recorded patients treated between 1994 and 1998.	0.572794862770083
In seven cases the colonoscopy had been done for diagnostic and in four cases for therapeutic reason.	0.575084300480754
Nine women and two men (age range 56 to 92 years) were affected.	0.6626580752975415
In 77 % the perforation was found in the sigmoid colon.	0.7353586793730738
All patients were operated on and five sutures, five resections and one colostomy were performed.	0.5688941418561753
No significant differences could be shown in six patients with classical perforation compared with five patients presenting with prolonged abdominal pain.	0.6957776039815189
Only duration of symptoms was significantly different in the two groups.	0.5168769288786742
Three patients (85, 90 and 92 years) died from late complications.	0.6862512639799605
Indications of MR arthrography were analyzed in this prospective study.	0.4681355974480592
The aim was to evaluate possible advantages over conventional MRI, establish diagnostic criteria and to analyze its meaning further for the therapeutic management of postoperative patients.	0.6977771406003279
Nerve fibre-neuroendocrine cell complexes (NF-NEC-C's) are neuroendocrine cells located in the lamina propria of the gastrointestinal tract directly connected with nerve fibres of Meissner's plexus.	0.4507348739485194
We report on a patient with sporadic Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) with electron microscopically demonstrated multiple NF-NEC-C's in non-antral gastric mucosa.	0.5005394161064194
It is suspected that in ZES the hypergastrinaemia may represent a trophic stimulus for the proliferation of NF-NEC-C's in the gastric mucosa.	0.41748901505643016
Introduction: The prehospitaly initiated endotracheal intubation and controlled ventilation, is especially in multi-system-trauma cases, recognized to be the "gold standard".	0.6509635459079505
Thus especially in view of the increasing demands being placed upon the quality of prehospital emergency treatment in general, the quality of such prehospital induced ventilation, is becoming of increasing importance.	0.6432747294884344
Thereby we must take into consideration the limited possabilities, which are afflicted with a high degree of uncertainess, which we have at our disposal to effectively evaluate the efficiency of emergency ventilation.	0.7328653654417073
The purpose of our study within a collective of severely traumatized patients, was to determine the quality of prehospitaly induced ventilation with regards to the adequacy of oxygenation and ventilation and as a result of our findings, to identify areas for procedural optimization.	0.7085915377312099
Staging of any tumor, i.e.	0.28924856967258095
determination of the extent of the disease, serves to select the patients who might profit from curative surgical intervention or to define those patients with inoperable carcinomas who should be referred for other therapies, such as chemotherapy or irradiation.	0.6147349354604118
Furthermore, accurate staging is necessary for assessment of prognosis, for radiation therapy planning, and for differentiation of those with small-cell lung cancer or for follow-up examinations of small-cell lung cancer patients after during and after chemotherapy.	0.8133187760832351
The primary radiological staging and diagnostic modalities for assessment of bronchial carcinomas are computed tomography (CT) of the thorax including liver and adrenal glands, abdominal sonography, and bone scintigraphy.	0.6572798070058586
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be reserved for specific indications, e.g.	0.37259361406693875
infiltration of the chest wall or staging of patients with intolerance/allergy to intravenous contrast medium.	0.6351384896134806
The clinical value of nuclear medicine techniques, such as [18F]2-fluoride-2-desoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) for evaluation of lymph nodes and distant metastases, In-111 octreotide/somatostatin receptor scans for staging of small-cell lung cancer, and thallium-201 SPECT are currently being assessed in numerous studies, although these techniques are already in routine use.	0.6866840672471732
In future these or nuclear medicine techniques, as well as techniques using molecular-based contrast material, especially for MR imaging, currently in experimental status, may yield serious potential for staging purposes.	0.59679943200031

Myocardial infarctions may be precipitated by external triggers.	0.2647861122692436
External triggers include physical activity and emotional stress as well as other infrequent triggers such as war threats or earthquakes.	0.3988260900614402
Changes in the environment also play an important role in the incidence of myocardial infarctions; circadian, seasonal, and weekly variations have been observed.	0.5939177553890889
Patients' behavior at the onset of symptoms depends on various factors and influences outcome and mortality.	0.5570576118110557
Appropriate preventive measures are indicated in order to protect patients during vulnerable periods.	0.534511152817692
Health education should be directed towards patients' behavior and promptly seeking medical assistance at the onset of symptoms.	0.43430843605921154
Introduction: In patients with neuroendocrine gastrointestinal tumors and liver metastases, but without known extrahepatic manifestations, liver transplantation may be indicated as curativ or "long-term-palliativ" therapy.	0.7060880361862661
For these patients the absence of bone lesions is mandatory.	0.6182810663394119
A patient suffering from long-standing pustular psoriasis of the palms was treated for 3 weeks with a mercury-containing drug.	0.5570481020959102
Exacerbation into generalized pustular psoriasis developed.	0.17824243711339713
Mercury levels in blood and urine were increased.	0.4374165315860241
After withdrawal of the mercury preparation, therapy with DMPA (2,3-Dimercapto-1-propane-sulfonic acid), a mercury antidote, was initiated, together with short-term treatment with aromatic retinoids and PUVA.	0.7068194153368503
Within a few days mercury levels decreased significantly and the skin lesions practically disappeared.	0.7135888578959878
Based on the results of chromosome analysis from cell cultures and testis biopsies, the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in infertile men is up to 20%.	0.6570010427440445
Chromosomal analysis from peripheral blood cultures is a routine procedure while the analysis of meiotic chromosomes is labor intensive and mainly used in a scientific setting.	0.5221835330427608
Of all infertile males, 7-9% show numerical and/or structural chromosomal abnormalities in their peripheral blood lymphocytes.	0.5548234320722485
There is an inverse correlation between sperm count and the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities, with 21% of patients with non-obstructive azoospermia having a chromosomal abnormality, most often Klinefelter's syndrome.	0.723695186109283
The rate of patients with chromosomal abnormalities is only 9% in patients with severe oligozoospermia (less than 5 million/ml), and structural abnormalities are found more often in this group.	0.7563986786247704
Using fluorescence in situ analysis the number of selected chromosomes can be assayed in single sperm cells.	0.3605136156346785
There is no consensus on whether infertile men have a higher proportion of aneuploid (disomic) sperm cells than fertile men.	0.5082391624033383
Taking into account the results from meiotic studies in infertile men, an increased rate of aneuploid sperm cells is likely.	0.6475648403808814
Chromosomal analysis should be performed on all infertile men being treated with ICSI as the result of this analysis could have important consequences in their reproductive decisions.	0.6007744034140128

Survival beyond neonatal period is the exception in untreated infants.	0.32983603678865986
The prognosis, however, is no longer hopeless.	0.6867332522973612
Clinical stabilization of a neonate with HLH is appropriate until a management decision, based on appropriate parental counselling, can be made.	0.44882579292035046
Forty-one patients demonstrating clinical symptoms for cerebral infarction were investigated by magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion-weighted echo-planar imaging (DWI) and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI).	0.5773710246680357
In 8 patients only DWI showed the cerebral lesions clearly.	0.4801857497477657
One patient with positive DWI and T2WI suffered from HSV encephalitis.	0.43294252551699425
DWI is superior to T2WI in assessment of small cortical infarcts and cerebral infarction in patients with preexisting vascular lesions.	0.4784083387065445
DWI is not specific, so other causes like cerebral hematoma and encephalitis have to be considered.	0.5608446147537145
Juvenile polyposis was first described by Cronkhite and Canada in 1955.	0.4262127223822749
This disease is characterized by juvenile intestinal polyps and ectodermal abnormalities.	0.3385737218822969
The etiology of Cronkhite-Canada syndrome (CCS), however, is still not well understood.	0.6710756008401428
Interestingly, among patients with CCS a significant correlation (16.5 %) with intestinal carcinomas has been observed.	0.6991450995051517
Thus, malignant transformation and/or genetic predisposition may be involved in the initiation of the disease.	0.6721124224189716
In the following, epidemiology, symptoms, morphology and therapy of CCS are discussed.	0.6463526290109225
Our examinations are based on studies reported in the literature and on a case report of a female patient who developed a colon carcinoma 2 years after initial diagnosis of CCS.	0.8873615254368784
Pacemaker erythema is a rare, irreversible side effect of cardiac pacemakers, clinically characterized by epifocal teleangiectatic erythema.	0.5722913769716986
Histology reveals teleangiectatic vessels in the superficial dermis and a slight perivascular infiltrate.	0.42561532826911025
We report on three patients presenting with pacemaker erythema following either pacemaker or defibrillator implantation.	0.584033571286552
The pathogenesis of this histopathologically uncharacteristic lesion is unknown.	0.4101746243391089
In contrast to peri- or postoperative pacemaker infections, physical irritation can be considered a possible triggering mechanism.	0.8196090647205061
Allergic reactions to the implanted material have been ruled out by negative patch test results.	0.4630915991230517
The present legal requirements for the prescription of controlled drugs remains an impediment to adequate therapy for chronic pain because of an abundance of legal regulations.	0.5113516695667945
The physician prescribing opioids must consider the permitted maximum amount per prescription, the period of time the drug is prescribed for, numerous cross references, and other special regulations, and he still cannot be sure that he does not violate certain legal requirements.	0.6009542984243555
Often these difficulties result in withholding necessary pain treatment!	0.22297755751185128
In the authors' opinion it should be sufficient to write a specific prescription form for controlled drugs in the same way as any other ordinary prescription without jeopardizing the safety of the drug control system.	0.6405891580999817
It is important that the use of the narcotic be justified in the sense of § 13 Abs.	0.5764421079953432
1 of the drug control regulation, as judged by the responsible prescriber of the drug, and that any offence be punished.	0.868975210540028
The use of triplicate prescriptions guarantees sufficient proof.	0.26778305012294956
Legislation is requested that will substitute for the present drug control regulations, which are difficult to handle.	0.7406474391231164
The aim of the study was to investigate the ability to activate the quadriceps femoris muscle voluntarily in patients after severe knee injuries and it's influence on muscle function.	0.6535027144754145
33 male patients after ACL-rupture with concomitant injuries were investigated with a twitch-interpolation-method to determine the maximal voluntary contraction force (MVC) and the ability to activate the quadriceps muscle voluntarily.	0.6222792986051457
The results were compared to a previously investigated group of patients after isolated ACL-rupture and to an aged-matched control group.	0.7579884523922034
Managed care, i.e., the integration of health insurance and delivery of care under the direction of one organization, is gaining importance in the USA health market.	0.7001476553897734
The initial effects consisted of a decrease in insurance premiums, a very attractive feature for employers.	0.5614298924426091
Managed care promises to contain expenditures for health care.	0.2921500352662715
Given the shrinking public resources in Germany, managed care seems attractive for the German health system, too.	0.3939599245656442
In this review the development of managed care, the principal elements, forms of organisation and practical tools are outlined.	0.6379512416111986
The regulation of the delivery of care by means of controlling and financial incentives threatens the autonomy of physicians: the physician must act as a "double agent", caring for the interest for the individual patient and being restricted by the contract with the managed care organisation.	0.5965696845835754
Cost containment by managed care was achieved by reducing the fees for physicians and hospitals (and partly by restricting care for patients).	0.5403489395873959
Only a fraction of this cost reduction was handed over to the enrollee or employer, and most of the money was returned with profit to the shareholders of the managed care organisations.	0.4746254762200396
The preeminent role of primary care physicians as gatekeepers of the health network led to a reduced demand for specialist services in general and for university hospitals and anesthesiologists in particular.	0.5297273241228228
The paradigm of managed care, i.e., to guide the patient and the care giver through the health care system in order to achieve cost-effective and high quality care, seems very attractive.	0.7220621913477241
The stress on cost minimization by any means in the daily practice of managed care makes it doubtful if managed care should be an option for the German health system, in particular because there are a number of restrictions on it in German law.	0.6489000879899358
Background: Analysis of the impact of head fractures, intracranial hemorrhages, brain edema, and prognostic risk factors on long-term outcome in children with severe head injury.	0.7472819503900588
Background: In the past, the main problem of transscleral cyclophotocoagulation was related to the energy dosage of the individual effect.	0.9201764917446394
Since the target tissue is not directly observable, no information about the coagulation process was available to the surgeon.	0.6096351427288834
High inter- and intraindividual variations of the tissue properties often led to under- or overdosage.	0.7649080495916765
Underdosage is therapeutically useless, while overdosage causes the so-called "popeffects" which may induce severe damage to the eye.	0.5870799922875342
In the past, most scientific or routine studies on heart rate variability (HRV) were done using commercial Holter ECG devices with traditional magnetic tapes.	0.5796421172179985
All methods to calculate parameters of HRV are based on the measurement of time intervals between successive sinus cardiac beats, in practice RR intervals.	0.6040503733638309
Hence, results of HRV calculation depend on the quality of primary data acquisition.	0.5684177332382515
However, technical standards on accuracy of RR interval acquisition in magnetic tape and digital solid state Holter ECG systems do not exist as yet.	0.5210687790337193
Therefore in a laboratory investigation accuracy of HRV parameter calculation after traditional standard tape with and without real-time analysis and digital solid state data acquisition was compared in three commercial Holter ECG systems [Ela medical (E), Oxford Medilog Excel (O) and Medset Cardiolight (M)].	0.5108030636072999
A computer-based ECG simulator was used to synthesize a test signal consisting of artificial P-QRS complexes of fixed rate, quartz stabilized "sinus rhythms".	0.43391113481735233
Two channel analog tape and digital 24h recordings of the fixed rate test signal were performed simultaneously.	0.3388353900499273
The influence of recording technology on accuracy of RR interval measurement and consequently on time domaine HRV was shown by comparing five standard 24-h time domain parameters.	0.43223911906556245
As expected, in the three Holter systems the analog tape recordings showed a higher, technically induced, artificial RR variability.	0.5956337353312674
The SDNN values (E: 9.38ms vs 2.68ms; p<0.001; O: 3.89ms vs 0.97ms; p<0.001; M: 10.47ms vs 2.89ms; p=0.001), SDNN-Index values (E: 8.22ms vs 0.90ms; p<0.001; O: 3.75ms vs 0.90ms; p<0.001; M: 7.81ms vs 1.49ms, p<0.001) and RMSSD-values (E: 10.39ms vs 2.16ms; p<0.001; O: 10.05ms vs 1.88ms, p<0.001; M: 8.62ms vs 1.69ms; p<0.001) were significantly lower if acquisition was done by digital solid devices in all systems, SDANN (M: 9.83ms vs 5.37ms; p<0.001) in the Medset system too.	0.6121087089978794
The used method is a possible way to validate commercial Holter ECG systems for HRV analysis.	0.5476167044981443
Clinical significance of artifical HRV seems to be low.	0.5184293653884131
Cases of gallstone ileus (108) were analyzed retrospectively over 30 years.	0.6800717355861183

Since 1992 sonography has proveded an exact diagnosis in 10 of 15 cases.	0.5062452101642227
In the triad of known gallstone, non-specific epigastric pain with assumed small intestinal obstruction, and impossible detection of a stone in the gallbladder, there is strong suspicion of a gallstone ileus.	0.5936859457652948
The evidence is given if the gallstone is seen in the bowels.	0.5084083775029106
Intraoperatively more than one stone was found in the intestines in 20 %, and cholecystoduodenal fistulas were encountered in 83 %.	0.7059799528282532
There has been no significant change in mortality for 30 years.	0.5694988280810711
Autologous transplantation in brachial plexus injuries has become significantly more efficacious through increased knowledge of the microtopographic anatomy of the fascicle structures and the refinement of microneurosurgical techniques.	0.41752712819670856
Recovery of shoulder and upper arm functions can be achieved with autologous transplantation in the majority of patients under optimized conditions.	0.6535494133896749
However, attempts to restore forearm, hand and finger functions in this way have been disappointing so far.	0.5750980403270227
Therapeutic success is primarily governed by early decision making, selection of adequate surgical strategies and intensive and longlasting postoperative management.	0.4291508358602771
Leg venectasia is a common problem.	0.5306406117867225
Although there are a variety of therapeutic modalities, none of them gives satisfactory results.	0.583508237462142
The effects of sclerotherapy in the treatment of telangiectasia with a small diameter are poor.	0.45925570564034374
Electrocoagulation and argon laser treatment often result in scarring.	0.29303788005615894
We studied the effectiveness of the flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser at a wavelength of 585 nm in the treatment of leg venectasia.	0.45334687756934017
After repeated treatments using this laser system, only 30% of the vessels that looked blue on clinical examination could be removed; we obtained better lightening of smaller red, telangiectatic vessels with a diameter up to 0.4 mm.	0.6755104732438503
However, hyperpigmentation frequently developed after treatment.	0.3394226159799566
In post-treatment biopsies, occlusion of the vessels was found.	0.6074787650594285
Based on these results, we recommend a combined therapy for leg venectasia.	0.8899507709153702
Larger diameter vessels should be treated with sclerotherapy, while finer telangiectasia can be treated with the flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser.	0.6549807632209924
Total hip replacement is often recommended for the treatment of femoral neck fractures in elderly patients.	0.5882743591162689
A less invasive approach with shorter operating time is the replacement of the femoral head only, leaving the acetabular cartilage in situ.	0.5863349000657712
Hemiarthroplastic hip replacement using a metallic head prosthesis was not successful in the past, because the majority of patients developed protrusio acetabuli after surgery.	0.6361127816242248
In the present study hemiarthroplastic hip replacement using an Al2O3-ceramic head was shown to be a useful method for the treatment of femoral neck fractures in elderly patients.	0.6606856537017228
From 1985 to 1990 277 patients were treated with hemiarthroplasty.	0.5204135595818647
The average age at the time of accident and operation was 81.7 years.	0.6930789560598298
At the time of follow-up in 1993 only 77 survivors were available for examination.	0.6183849252272381

Only three patients had hip pain, and in four cases the roentgenographic examination revealed protrusio acetabuli.	0.7827482476466805
Two of these four patients underwent revision surgery for replacement of the cup, leaving the stem in situ.	0.5179724202734446
In view of the small number of approach-related complications, hemiarthroplastic hip replacement using an Al2O3-ceramic head is the recommended surgical treatment for femoral neck fractures in elderly patients.	0.5177342902696705
In the rare patient with protrusio acetabuli, revision surgery can be performed to replace the cup, leaving the stem in situ.	0.5572142555565033
Functional relaxation (FE), a somato-psychotherapeutic method, can reduce asthmatic symptoms.	0.565850312071785
The efficiency of a 5 minute introduction of elements of functional relaxation (EFE) is compared with a placebo-relaxation-method not based on the hypothetical mechanisms of FE, and a standardised pharmacological bronchodilative test using salbutamol.	0.6890610342173636
In a controlled prospective randomised single blind setting 18 children and adolescents with acute asthma were treated on three consecutive days with each method.	0.4731494977589149
Before and ten minutes after therapy the patients had bodyplethysmographic pulmonary function testing.	0.5522736973316248
U-Tests showed that the baseline measurements were comparable.	0.5110238952815851
The before-after-comparison revealed significant changes for EFE and salbutamol, not for the placebo-relaxation.	0.49662694745154495
There were significant differences between the intraindividual differences of the airway resistance and the specific airway resistance between salbutamol and the placebo-relaxation, not between EFE and salbutamol or EFE and the placebo-relaxation.	0.5977047031494569
FE can be an effective complementary treatment in children or adolescents with asthma.	0.5585800008890243

Immunohistochemical reactions were performed with antibodies against collagen types I, III, IV and VI and against laminin, proliferating antigen KI 67 and GFAP.	0.5092966108479405
In glaucomatous eyes the characteristic arrangement of collagen fibrils is lacking.	0.33358038209346047
Septa of the lamina cribrosa appear enlarged.	0.3695140657534886
The immunoreactivity of all examined collagen types is stronger in glaucomatous eyes.	0.3241601981191022
The axon basement membranes show an irregular and interrupted pattern.	0.2238057037766148
The number of proliferating cells with positive GFAP staining in glaucomatous cribriform plates is distinctly higher.	0.344216798394735
We postulate that fibroblasts and astrocytes in the stroma of glaucomatous lamina cribrosa could be stimulated to increased and uncontrolled proliferation.	0.3768781136098442
Associated disorganization and raised secretion of extracellular matrix may lead to axon constriction and, secondarily, to neural degeneration.	0.46395940839761723
Concomitant pathologies (labral lesions, intra-/extra-osseous ganglia and stress bone marrow edema) in adult residual hip dysplasia (RHD) might influence the outcome of conservative hip surgery.	0.6362761436808596
The aim of our prospective clinical study was to assess the value of preoperative MR arthrography in diagnosing concomitant lesions and in making surgical decisions in RHD.	0.6593157486229124
The first 37 consecutive patients with a minimum follow-up of 18 months have been analysed.	0.8120115430678359
All 37 patients presented RHD with the clinical symptomatology of labral lesions and underwent routine preoperative MRA.	0.4873523824200931
According to clinical, radiological and MR arthrographical criteria, these 37 patients were subdivided into four therapeutic subgroups: (1) reorientation of the acetabulum using the Tönnis triple pelvic osteotomy (TPO); (2) intertrochanteric varisation osteotomy (IVO); (3) palliative decompression with only symptomatic partial resection of the torn labrum (PALL); (4) primary total hip replacement (TEP).	0.5745558351737059
Based on the preliminary clinical and radiological outcomes of these four subgroups, the following conclusions can be drawn: labral lesions are considered to be a sign of chronic joint instability.	0.7438076375399832
Therefore, acetabular malorientation should be corrected by redirectional osteotomy of the acetabulum (TPO-subgroup) even in low grades of RHD if labral lesions are present.	0.5530970801321209
"Palliative" labral resections without corrective osteotomy (PALL subgroup) in secondary osteoarthritis due to RHD are definitively obsolete, because they rapidly progress to severe osteoarthritis due to surgically accelerated joint instability.	0.5236753529189143
In RHD with highly osteoarthritic hip joints and concomitant lesions, one should not hesitate to perform primary THR even in young patients.	0.5263845489380355
Severe infections of the talus are often associated with complete septic collapse of the talus.	0.5965434994673213
In this connection, open fractures with defects or significant comminution have a bad prognosis is as far as reconstruction of the talus is concerned.	0.6461038561513983
In the Department of Traumatology, Braunschweig, in 1995 three patients (all male, average age 35.3 +/- 10.2 years) were treated with cancellous bone grafting after talectomy performed because of infection and complete septic collapse of the talus.	0.7464553169586055
In two of these cases third-degree open total dislocation of the talus had been sustained.	0.8144275990401953
The third patient came to us after undergoing arthroscopy of the ankle region in another hospital.	0.5728576098811863
In each case a fulminating infection was the outcome.	0.43250723146425496
Following a step-by-step algorithm, in a first step urgent radical debridement with talectomy was done.	0.6447185328025165
To maintain approximation between the tibia and calcaneus on one side and the os naviculare on the other, the bony defect was filled with PMMA chains and the external fixateur technique was used for immobilization during treatment of the infection.	0.7051155297659468
After second- and third-look procedures a free flap was grown for soft tissue coverage within the first 10 days.	0.6053524230648984
After 17.6 +/- 3.3 days the talus was replaced with a cancellous bone graft, combined with double arthrodesis in two cases, and external fixation for the next 4-5 weeks.	0.7441198126170284
In the third patient a triple arthrodesis was done.	0.475702147291517
At follow-up after an average of 12 months (range 8-17 months), the bone graft with arthrodesis had been completely integrated in all cases.	0.8153632852220243
All patients are free of symptoms in normal life.	0.6779348365174497
In the case of severe open fractures of the talus with significant comminution combined with infection and septic bone collapse conservation of the talus is often impossible.	0.6555054568838864
The combination of homologous cancellous bone grafting and arthrodesis after talectomy is therefore a good method of keeping any decrease in the function of the foot to a minimum.	0.5877658826198682
Meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis was diagnosed in a 63 year old female in Austria.	0.6120524031369349
Sixteen months after onset she still suffers from ataxia, disturbance of gait and bilateral hearing impairment.	0.37269295771233135
Being a farmer, the patient belongs to a recognized high-risk-group, as most other infected people do.	0.8252955902297636
To the best of our knowledge, there has been no report of a human infection by Streptococcus suis in Austria so far.	0.6143756397237621
The results of neurophysiological tests excluded a direct lesion to the cochlea during the acute phase of meningitis, and thus, are in contrast to the guinea-pig-model by Kay, who showed suppurative labyrinthitis being the cause of hearing loss.	0.7146331828485564

Numerous epidemiological studies about multiple trauma patients do not include an analysis of patients under the age of 18.	0.7054615617572574
To study this, the data of 682 patients with multiple traumata, treated between 1981 and 1991 at Hannover Medical School, Germany, were retrospectively analyzed.	0.7205798006307393
The patients were divided into four age-related groups: preschool age (< 6 years), school age (< 13 years), teenagers (< 18 years) and adults (L 18 years).	0.8407109285021229
Analyzed were the cause of trauma, localization of injuries and the cause of death.	0.6688840424401206
Children were less often injured as passengers in cars, but more often injured as pedestrians and bicyclists than adults.	0.5041980910270186
However, children showed a significant higher mortality than adults, with threefold increased risk of death when they injured as passengers in car accidents.	0.6888429077043875
In all groups injuries to the head and the legs were most common.	0.7613334931693502
Children showed a lower incidence of trauma to the thorax, abdomen, hip and arms than the adult group.	0.5187453280239265
Nevertheless, trauma to the thorax, abdomen and head was associated with the highest risk of death in all groups.	0.7640774312595388
Spinal cord injuries, especially injuries to the neck, also showed a high risk of death.	0.9123617362262507
Children younger than 6 years had the most severe head injuries.	0.6804274524005655
Safety improvements for children in cars, helmet usage on bicycles and early training in traffic safety for children might decrease the lethality in this group of trauma patients.	0.47414452240287336
During the past 7 years 45 patients have been operated upon using the Childs-Phillips method.	0.5796419180384077

None of the deaths occurred as a direct result of transmesenteric small-bowel plication.	0.5521355784107598
An early recurrence of intestinal obstruction occurred in 4.4 % and a laparotomy was repeated.	0.8860075493649182
During the most recent examinations 86.5 % of those patients checked had (virtually) no complaints - 91.9 % based upon the Visick classification.	0.7519742797594462
A subtotal intestinal obstruction occurred during the period of the study in 8.1 % of cases, but could be conservatively treated.	0.9013413352890199
Up until the most recent examination there were still no instances of a late recurrence.	0.5419742038784663
Most intestinal obstruction recurrences are due to errors specific to the technique and are early recurrences.	0.45749090647458446

Questionnaires were mailed to patients.	0.15839950938531294
53% of the patients (n = 86) returned the questionnaire duly filled in; 20% (n = 32) had died; in the remaining 27% of cases (n = 44) no information was obtained on further development.	0.7979404053635148
80% of those patients who responded lived at home despite numerous medical problems.	0.6983028846991388
Family members assumed most of the care required.	0.4107915549460405
Follow-up treatment and pain therapy proved to be particularly problematic.	0.6740351701213704
The Barthel Index according to data collected was significantly lower compared to figures noted upon release from the hospital.	0.43974903762664397

Patients: We report on four infants with nonketotic hyperglycinemia, three with a neonatal form and one with the milder infantile form.	0.6946634209589775
Despite early diagnosis and persistent therapy including dextromethorphan and sodium benzoate, two infants with the neonatal form deteriorated progressively and died at the age of 16 and 50 months, respectively, only one survived severely retarded with seizures, opisthotonus and spastic quadriplegia.	0.5587609773920318
The serum concentrations of glycine decreased following sodium benzoate treatment but cerebrospinal fluid/serum glycine ratio remained elevated with no improvement in clinical outcome.	0.35324629917217176
The patient with the infantile form has been treated for over three years with dextromethorphan, and is now a severely retarded child without seizure activity and continuous psychomotor development.	0.696735370954658
Immunosuppression-related Candida infections may be most successfully treated using biological response modifiers and recombinant cytokines to enhance expression of host pro-inflammatory and antimicrobial mediators, notably tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-), interleukin 1 (IL-1), and gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN).	0.5361826646943494
Important but unappreciated differences in the immunopathophysiology of fungal vs. bacterial infections make such cytokine priming appear contrary to current strategies for reducing cytokine-mediated organ injury and mortality due to gram-negative bacteremia and endotoxemia.	0.409216700626843
Optimistically, preclinical studies to date have found that the coadministration of such immunoadjuvants does not compromise, and actually may improve, the efficacy of synthetic antifungals.	0.5790938797135509
Such combination therapies should continue to be evaluated in animal models of Candida infection which otherwise progress to lethal shock or chronic disseminated disease despite aggressive use of existing antifungal agents.	0.4520308201965502
Bilateral neck exploration is the standard procedure in primary hyperparathyroidism.	0.6862206443663321

"NoToX Histological Fixative" is a formaldehyde substitute for the fixation of tissues prior to histological investigation.	0.560665935417888
Intraoperative samples and necropsy tissue were tested.	0.23807574626170197
NoToX was substituted for formaldehyde in the fixation step, otherwise the same manufacturer-specified protocols were used for all reagents.	0.4802549207869273
Conventional histological and accepted immunohistological investigations, especially for tumour diagnosis, were used.	0.7969093583076736

Although none of the closure devices has been shown to reduce major local complications as compared to manual compression, all sealing devices have documented a significant reduction in time to hemostasis.	0.6240825835843289
The increased patient comfort is essentially related to the ability of sheath removal immediately after PTCA.	0.5605435573054007
Vascular closure devices reduce the burden of medical staff and decrease hospital costs by earlier discharge.	0.415234296293727
Amniotic fluid is a major factor of the intrauterine environment, and deviation from the normal volume is associated with an increased perinatal morbidity and mortality.	0.6868006896553129
Polyhydramnios occurs in 0.2 to 1.6 % of pregnancies.	0.8864314612354163
It may be due to a number of congenital anomalies, an abnormal karyotype, maternal diabetes, Rh-disease or intrauterine infections potentially requiring non-invasive or invasive measures.	0.5455753729655188
However, the most common indication for prenatal intervention due to polyhydramnios is the Twin-Twin-Transfusion Syndrom (TTTS).	0.5932365752544401
Treatment of polyhydramnios may focus on correction of the causative lesion, or symptomatic relief through drainage of amniotic fluid.	0.5926881276380843
Maternal administration of cyclooxygenase inhibitors represents a further, non-invasive therapeutic option.	0.4220214382044121
Indomethacin, Sulindac, or Nimesulide reduce the fetal urine output thus decreasing amniotic fluid volume over time without the risks associated with invasive procedures.	0.4399698776592959
However, potentially serious ductal constriction as well as a delay in the onset of amniotic fluid reduction have limited its application.	0.5839318977851039
Percutaneous amniotic fluid drainage may provide immediate reduction of intrauterine pressure, but is associated with a complication rate of 1 to 1.5 %.	0.803521197189765
The hemodynamic characteristics of monochorionic pregnancies complicated by TTTS have led to the development of endoscopic laser coagulation of placental vascular anastomoses as a definitive treatment.	0.3968831294555511
Treatment is only required in a small minoritiy of pregnancies with polyhydramnios.	0.5594203288872029
Mild cases can be managed expectatively.	0.5230591288147671
Intrauterine pressure increases with an excessive increase in amniotic fluid volume (AFI > 400 mm or MVP > 150 mm) leads to the elevation of intrauterine pressure.	0.5622174409407308
Complications such as preterm premature rupture of membranes and preterm labor may lead to premature delivery.	0.4157148286375212
The main goal of prenatal treatment of polyhydramnios is thus the improvement of fetal outcome through prolongation of gestation and/or the alleviation of maternal symptoms.	0.5593304314627278
With the recent developments in computer technology and the improvements in modern neuroimaging, frame-based stereotactic guidance for open microsurgical procedures has been increasingly replaced by neuronavigation, also called frameless stereotaxy.	0.4716507929938074
It allows transfer of individual patient's images onto the operative field to assist the neurosurgeon intraoperatively in defining the tumor margins or identifying functionally important brain areas.	0.45782718046422727
The different localization techniques employed are articulated position-sensing arms, infrared or ultrasound systems working with the principle of satellite navigation and robotic systems integrated with the operating microscope.	0.42857091145878007
In 200 operations performed with different systems (arm-based, robotic and infrared) the method proved to be helpful, enabling fewer invasive procedures to be performed.	0.6676388647316033
With a mean deviation of 2.87 +/- 1.9 mm for intraoperative localization, the accuracy was only slightly worse than in frame-based stereotaxy with deviations below 2 mm.	0.7635158934167132
Neuronavigation was most helpful for operations on deeply seated lesions, skull-base tumors and lesions in brain areas with high functionality.	0.44631475008103444
The major disadvantage is the use of preoperative data for navigation, leading to inaccuracies when anatomical structures are altered during the operation by resection of tumors or shift of intracranial soft tissue.	0.5226402144409862
Intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might be a solution for this problem.	0.4189530432469532
With the method of intraoperative MRI developed in our department it has already been possible to update neuronavigation with images reflecting intraoperative changes in anatomy.	0.5653147512651032
Therefore, neuronavigation is definitely a method with growing importance in operative routine, and it will also spread into other surgical specialties.	0.5697829392184378
Severe pain of mucositis induced by cytostatic conditioning therapy in bone marrow transplantation (BMT) patients generally requires continuous parenteral opioid treatment.	0.5392712051559966
Cognitive and psychological disturbances are frequent complications subsequent to BMT and may result from cerebral opioid side effects.	0.5203449587043366
The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficiency of continuous morphine in mucositis pain and the side-effects in BMT patients.	0.6747684393828202
Particular emphasis was placed on the question of whether reaction times, which are usually measured to estimate opioid effects upon vigilance, are influenced by pain-induced cognitive impairments in pain patients.	0.6878155731248805
Methods While in hospital, 10 BMT patients were examined daily with the aid of a mucositis scale, subjective visual analog scales (VAS) for pain and mood parameters, a German version of the McGill pain questionnaire (MPQ), and a mental performance task battery, and the morphine given was documented.	0.7365455516327808
Mental performance tests were simple auditory reaction time and choice reaction time.	0.38580685332603626
Seven patients also performed a Sternberg memory search test in which they had to use 'yes' and 'no' response keys to match visually presented test letters to a previously memorized set of letters.	0.4282897915800606
Practice and baseline data were collected within the first week before BMT.	0.7000555967385178
Results The intensity and duration of mucositis differed from patient to patient, resulting in different pain intensities and MPQ scores.	0.42359153889630485
Prolongation of the choice reaction time averaged over the period of mucositis treatment correlated significantly with residual pain intensity (Spearman rs = 0.88, p < 0.01) but not with morphine dose (rs = 0.35, p = 0.33).	0.5640799979779079
For the Sternberg memory search test greater correlation coefficients resulted between reaction time and morphine dose (rs = 0.86, p = 0.014) than between reaction time and residual pain intensity (rs = 0.61, p = 0.15).	0.49585798151129207
In turn, pain intensity, unlike morphine dose, was significantly correlated with high scores in the mood parameters for depression, passivity, and tiredness.	0.6973993887591189
Conclusions It is concluded that both pain and morphine can impair cognitive performance, but that these mental stressors seem to differ according to qualitative criteria.	0.5103815020149208
Whereas pain might slow reaction time by distracting a patient's attention, particularly in low mental demand tasks, morphine could interfere with more specific cognitive processes, such as short-term memory operations, that are required in more complex tasks.	0.6695549035255757

CT shows hemorrhage and calcification well.	0.21348617603194414
The criteria are the primary site, size, tumor growth, brain-stem enlargement, delineation, intralesional structure, exophytic components and enhancement.	0.5939546928798304
Secondary criteria are herniation, hydrocephalus and liquorgenic seeding.	0.3205822326949486
In CT glioma are hypodense, in MRI hyperintense in T2 and hypointense in T1.	0.41953160959848995
Enhancement is seen in 25-60% and does not allow differentiation of tumor vs nontumor or gradings.	0.5991300657016099
Factors influencing poor outcome are high grade, a short history, cranial nerve involvement, severe brain-stem enlargement, pontine site, diffuse growth and recurrency.	0.6247647106495471
The 5-year-survival rate is 30% (after radiation: focal tumors 85%, diffuse 20%).	0.7891524342400548

Patients with chordomas and chondrosarcomas underwent fractionated carbon ion irradiation in 20 consecutive days (median total dose 60 GyE).	0.4744248985090238
Other histologies were treated with carbon ion boost of 15 to 18 GyE delivered to the macroscopeic tumor after fractionated stereotatic radiotherapy (median total dose 63 GyE).	0.4738344292091575
Mean follow-up was 9 months.	0.6700633473038357
Irradiation was well tolerated by all patients.	0.4897129581637861
Partial tumor remission was seen in 7 patients (15,5%) (Figure 2).	0.7486324979920913

Objective: Comparison of low back pain (LBP) patients with and without fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) with regard to affective distress.	0.6066853117225673
Methods: Patients with LBP who had been admitted to various clinics in Germany were examined upon admission.	0.6040203161062976
Comparisons were done by dividing the patients into groups with and without signs of FMS.	0.43566278272181386
Additionally, both groups were compared after being matched according to sex, age, and pain severity.	0.765770109842763
Results: 15 out of 135 LBP patients met the American College of Rheumatology criteria for fibromyalgia.	0.4193787811259368
Patients with FMS showed remarkably higher levels of pain severity and affective distress.	0.40822977749719275
After controlling for different levels of pain severity, these pronounced differences disappeared.	0.5599368515100089
Conclusion: Affective distress is not a unique feature of FMS, but seem to be caused entirely by higher levels of pain severity.	0.6855910900035599
Methods: Cases of invasive HI-infections were reported in a national active surveillance program.	0.5604069700086012
The case definition required the typical clinical picture and a HI positive culture from a physiologically sterile site (or throat swab or tracheal aspirate in case of epiglottitis or pneumonia) in children up to 10 years.	0.6541488666814146
All initial reports were validated with a questionnaire that additionally questioned the vaccination status, type of vaccine, therapy, outcome of the disease and characteristics of the bacteria.	0.7637348627080519
The relation between the type of Hib vaccine used on the risk of infection was analysed in a case control study with controls selected at random from a population based sampling frame.	0.6275193638652585
Results: 310 confirmed cases of invasive HI infections were reported during the observation period, 199 of these with meningitis, 56 with epiglottitis.	0.5058171879504104
The number of cases declined from 71 in the last six months of 1992, 120 in 1993, and 65 in 1994 to 54 cases in 1995.	0.6476796561845541
In 1995 the incidence in up to 5 year old children was 1.1/100 000 for all infection sites and 0.7/100 000 for meningitis.	0.7207241988216854
The reduced rates were mainly due to a decrease in the number of unvaccinated cases, whereas the number of cases in vaccinated children fluctuated between 22 and 36 per year.	0.6014285729441111
Most of these were observed in incompletely vaccinated children, who according to the German recommendations could already have received at least one further vaccination at the time of the infection.	0.852263641405277
The type of vaccine (HbOC, PRP-D or OMP) was not significantly associated with the risk of infection in vaccinated children.	0.7497025158182634
10 % of the bacteria produced betalactamase.	0.6991153514753282
In accordance with the German recommendations third generation cephalosporines were used in almost all cases of meningitis.	0.7318386204884192
One third of these, however, received additional antibiotics.	0.4599385127523397
Conclusions: The present incidence of systemic HI infections in Germany is low.	0.7434650320174063
A further decrease, however, would be possible with "on time" completion of the vaccination schedule according to the German recommendations in all children.	0.6524835619962793
For more than a century peritoneal adhesions are being recognized as frequent sequelae following abdominal surgery.	0.48580825309106324
Intraoperative lesions of the mesothelial lining by abrasion, ischemia, dissication, and foreign bodies result in complaints, intestinal obstruction, female infertility, and problems during reoperations.	0.5530149746752215
The global increase of life expectancy and surgical procedures are leading to rising incidences of adhesion-related complications and subsequent socio-economic implications.	0.5972490582009079
As of today, there is no safe and efficient prophylaxis available.	0.5806101188670644
Scientific efforts should be aimed at a liquid substance for single intraperitoneal application which significantly reduces postoperative adhesions at reasonable cost without adverse effects on blood coagulation and wound healing.	0.3852171871432067
Even today the name of F. D. von Recklinghausen is often mentioned in connection with primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism.	0.4524985639451726
He was one of the first physicians and scientists to render outstanding services to the classification of structural changes of bones, and in many aspects his work remains valid today.	0.7377606332820471
He succeeded through precise and comparative studies in making the disease and symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism known and thus distinguishing it from other known structural bone diseases.	0.5469446661607084
He also described the phenomenon of "bone remodeling" which has become relevant today again.	0.6519066250787822
Although his written macroscopic and microscopic observations include meticulously precise differentiations which make it difficult to study them today, they are still of interest in order to follow his basic ideas.	0.47080369302443376
This article does not constitute a comprehensive biography, but it contains a description of F. D. von Recklinghausen's important work on bone pathology against the background of the main stages of his life.	0.5860595409843001
Soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) of the extremities are characterized by a high rate of local recurrences.	0.7360423742078712
Limb salvage approaches using multimodality therapy protocols have replaced amputation.	0.2753341122053246
In order to evaluate isolated hyperthermic limb perfusion (ILP) in a multimodality therapy concept, we reviewed our patients treated using this method.	0.771935659233187
Between January 1982 and December 1995, 25 ILPs, using cisplatin, melphalan and adriamycin, were performed in 22 patients with STS.	0.7077827296685251
Forty percent were treated for local recurrences; histology was dominated by malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) and synovial sarcoma.	0.5023031305437669
In all, 68 % of the STS were classified as UICC stage IIb or IIIa/b.	0.5319824166477275
Most of the cases (14) underwent wide or radical resection, 4 patients received intraoperative radiotherapy, and 5 were treated with external beam radiation.	0.9387478198473264
Complications were recorded in 32 % of the cases.	0.6999965832354754
With a median follow-up of 45 months (range 1-143), the 5-year overall survival rate was 81 %.	0.8002033584398284
The median recurrence-free time was 19 months and the 5-year disease-free survival rate 34 %.	0.6638317526581501
There were 13 local failures, and distant metastases developed in 36 % of the patients.	0.7121581036318412
Concerning high-grade sarcomas (UICC stage IIb, IIIa/b), we found local recurrences in 75 % of all cases.	0.8634598740055336
Five of 11 patients with local failures underwent perfusion after they refused amputation, and 7 incompletely resected STS received ILP without reoperation.	0.5192941077712802
All of these demonstrated local recurrence.	0.4085254257108827
This rate of local recurrence proved to be different from patients with tumor-free resection margins (p = 0.0001, log-rank test).	0.6300319907617684
The amputation rate after isolated limb perfusion was 27 % (mean 11 months after treatment).	0.7068626386545911
Long-term results of ILP showed a considerable local recurrence rate and a low disease-free survival.	0.7436316511029506
Perfusion in patients without tumor-free resection margins does not prevent local recurrence.	0.6296372255750152
We conclude that ILP with cisplatin, melphalan and adriamycin should be considered carefully and is not an additional treatment strategy of first choice.	0.6616364990350561
Infections with the grampositive bacterium Clostridium difficile occurs mostly in worst ill, multimorbide patients treated with cytostatica or antibiotics.	0.35333456167929084
We report about two healthy children with pseudomembranous colitis caused by Clostridium difficile without an underlying illness or a former history of antibiotic treatment.	0.4390290337906098
Huntington's disease (HD) may cause considerable diagnostic problems because of the highly variable clinical features, especially at the beginning of the illness.	0.7423725120070744
We report the case of a 21-year-old woman with definite HD whose main symptoms were psychopathological changes that were misinterpreted as schizophrenia for 7 years.	0.4681446886679442
One reason for this misdiagnosis was the unusual, very early onset and the remarkable earlier age of onset of HD compared with that of other affected relatives.	0.5322268559559639
The phenomenon of earlier onset within one affected family is well documented in the literature in cases with the paternally transmitted mutated gene.	0.6513565784799114
Diagnostic landmarks were consideration of the initially mild disturbances of movement and the once again repeated detailed examination of the family history.	0.6045533131264416
ICD-10 is to be implemented for morbidity coding in Germany soon.	0.5242074876613076
The electronic versions of ICD-10 are introduced.	0.2628199740237002
For everyday work with the classification and for epidemiological research further tools are provided by DIMDI: ICD-10 meta files, ICD conversion tables, ICD-10 thesaurus of diagnostic terms.	0.28516576222563456
All files are available free of charge via the INTERNET.	0.2320699357298376
Because of poorly compartmentalized paraclavicular soft tissues, total extraperiostal claviculectomy in cases of malignoma with cortical destruction is always marginal.	0.3908082683263792
Due to different muscular compensation in the patients examined, literature disagrees on the biomechanical consequences of claviculectomy for the shoulder girdle.	0.5114034297261248
Thrombolytic therapy of pulmonary embolism with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) has proved to be an established method; but intra- and postoperatively, there is a high risk of bleeding complications.	0.9370184434422365
A 50-year old female with familiar hypophosphatasia and suspected deep venous thrombosis was undergoing osteosynthesis of a femoral fracture.	0.5214737227648967
Intraoperatively, petCO2 suddenly dropped, paCO2 rose, and circulatory arrest occurred.	0.42990170576405
CPR was started immediately with closed-chest cardiac compression and intravenous application of catecholamines.	0.447575327204771
While continuing CPR, surgery was stopped, the wound was sealed provisionally, and the patient was transferred to the ICU.	0.8090023802484084
Because of suspected massive pulmonary embolism, thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA in a total dosage of 100 mg was begun.	0.548048075695542
2.25 hours after the onset of circultory arrest, and 1.5 hours after the beginning of thrombolysis, the patient's hemodynamic patterns under high-dosage catecholamines were satisfactory.	0.7858298282673343
The bleeding after thrombolysis and coagulopathy required massive blood transfusions.	0.2655085977701035
The situation was also complicated by lesions of the liver, spleen and small intestines, which required surgical intervention, and acute renal failure, which had to be treated with transient hemofiltration.	0.8410708574454233
Twenty-eight days after receiving CPR, the patient was discharged from the ICU.	0.8288870321784678
A diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was established by clinical signs, capnometry, blood gas analysis, and electrocardiography.	0.7786366064168814
Due to the requirements of the emergency situation (ongoing CPR), further diagnostic tools were not used.	0.760989782165928
The patient survived without any neurological deficiency, despite the extended 135-min use of CPR, and despite massive bleeding due to surgical trauma, and to performing CPR in the presence of fibrinolytica.	0.6480194320740484
With the increasing use of cross-sectional echocardiography in patients with overt or suspected pulmonary thromboembolism in the emergency rooms, more and more right atrial thrombi are detected.	0.6345933208062831
These are so-called "transitthrombi" from the venous system on their way to the pulmonary arteries and they are a severe presentation of thromboembolic disease.	0.6378017561315225
They appear as an imminent pulmonary embolism and usually coexists with an already massive embolism.	0.44759726686426343
In patients were a right atrial thrombus is associated with a patent foramen ovale, paradoxical arterial embolism has been observed.	0.5404519314162917
Right sided heart thrombi have a high mortality rate and need immediate treatment.	0.5769779083706252
In our hospital we have seen 14 patients with right atrial thrombi and pulmonary embolism in a period of 6 years.	0.753072347591728
Three patients had cardiac arrest with a massive pulmonary embolism, seven patients presented with a submassive embolism.	0.6896757305089647
All patients were treated immediately after echocardiographic diagnosis without pulmonary angiography.	0.6890205408000964
In about half of the cases transesophageal echocardiography was done additionally for diagnosis and monitoring.	0.7099826834192544
Therapeutic options were thrombectomy, fibrinolysis or anticoagulants.	0.3491063089853103
We treated one of our patients with thrombectomy, eleven patients with fibrinolysis and two patients with anticoagulants.	0.6710784630139168
The era of modern anaesthesia in Germany began on January 24th, 1847.	0.43029306879885126
This day, professor in ordinary Johann Ferdinand Heyfelder anaesthetized a patient with sulphuric ether in the clinic of surgery and ophthalmology of the University of Erlangen.	0.5520434352245381
By March 17th, 1847, Heyfelder had performed 121 surgical procedures under ether.	0.3437292032207569
The operations in majority were teeth-extractions, and a few more complex operations such as the treatment of a harelip or of lip cancer or the resection of the shoulder joint.	0.7315548294708215
Heyfelder described in detail 108 of these inhalations in a little book entitled The experiments with sulphuric ether.	0.3989883788505801
This monograph published in March, 1847, represents one of the first complete dissertations on sulphuric ether in the German literature.	0.5863705443776951
In a special chapter he analyzed the development of various physiological and psychological parameters during etherization.	0.4457819922162358
Heyfelder also examined blood and urine of some etherized patients and reported that he did not find any important or specific alterations.	0.40593053553439
In 1847, Heyfelder was probably the first to apply salt-ether in man.	0.5073269197595558
After 4 administrations he concluded that salt ether acted more quickly but shorter than sulphuric ether.	0.28487285931528844
Advantageous were its application without problems and ease of induction.	0.34159105894449976
Disadvantageous were its high volatility, its price and the difficulty of getting it in a pure form.	0.46498088634546136
From December, 1847, on Heyfelder started to use chloroform.	0.5068446653945007
He was now able to perform more major operations, for example the total resection of the hip-joint.	0.7227702732992308
In his book The experiments with sulphuric ether, salt ether, and chloroform he describes a great number of anaesthetic administrations using these 3 agents.	0.441891309630245
In his summary Heyfelder concluded, that chloroform was undoubtly superior to sulphuric ether mainly because it was a quicker acting and longer lasting agent and leads to deeper narcosis.	0.4512551690351906
Moreover its application was much easier for it needed no special apparatus.	0.30900404796556885
However, because of its great anaesthetic potency, Heyfelder particularly demanded great caution in the application of chloroform.	0.6497804616482401
Explicitely he expected an assistant for chloroformizations, whose only duty was to supervise the inhalations and the patient - a forerunner of the modern specialized anaesthesiologist.	0.608943896062858
Background: To evaluate the publication rate of abstracts presented during the German Anaesthesia Congress (DAK) in MEDLINE-listed journals in comparison to the publication rate of abstracts presented during the meeting of the European Society of Anaesthesiologists (ESA).	0.5268970344778005
The uniform development of the human embryo, as described by classic human embryology, has been confirmed by sonoembryological studies.	0.7472045215090503
In particular, the embryonic brain is suitable for transvaginal ultrasound examination, because the large "cystic" cavities of the brain can easily be imaged.	0.6533370243788109
Sonoembryology not only describes normal embryonic anatomy and normal relations and proportions of organs, but also the development of structural abnormalities.	0.6141362872173113
Approximately one-third of all congenital anomalies, originate from the central nervous system (CNS).	0.35879945580225825
Based on normal sonoembryology and on recent experiences with early CNS anomalies, we recognize some sonographic signs of an early CNS anomaly: (1) Apparent dysmorphology of the brain or the head; (2) Altered appearance of the cerebral ventricles with disproportion of the brain compartments, where the amount of fluid is either greater or less than normal; (3) In the early fetal period, choroid plexuses that are too small to fill the ventricle from the medial to the lateral wall; (4) Irregular contour of the spine/back; (5) Extra-CNS anomalies.	0.6726990306110875
In the following survey, normal sonoembryology of the CNS is described, and CNS anomalies of the early pregnancy are discussed.	0.734104511903605
Telomerase is an enzyme that elongates telomeric repeats, the specialized structures at the ends of chromosomes that provide genomic stability and compensate for the physiologic process of telomere shortening.	0.4349347239643882
It has been implicated in cellular senescence, immortalization, and carcinogenesis.	0.5859161307188405
Over 85% of human tumours, and 95% of non-melanocytic skin cancers, show telomerase activity, in contrast to the corresponding normal tissues.	0.8296652861194281
This suggests that telomerase activity may play an important role in carcinogenesis.	0.40704664768548027
Recent evidence shows that telomerase is active not only in embryonal and germ line tissues, but also in some normal tissues.	0.6479103354832144
In the skin, this activity has been traced to the stem-cell-bearing epidermal basal cell layer, possibly reflecting the presence of telomerase-competent stem cells.	0.5859173341066914
These findings require a reconsideration of our interpretation of telomerase activity in tumours of the skin and other tissues.	0.586652572441831
As a causal relationship linking telomerase activity and cancer has yet not been demonstrated, some caution is warranted.	0.4898178333872053
The established criteria of auditory brainstem responses (ABR) such as JV latency, JI-V interpeak latency and interaural differences of  latency or amplitude have been found to be sensitive for detecting tumors of the cerebellopontine angle if a response is present.	0.4692003032338176
However, the ABR can be absent in cases of acoustic neuromas because of desynchronization, even though pure-one audiometry indicates that responses should be present.	0.5881264103903115
This retrospective study compared the ABR and pure-tone thresholds in 234 cases with cerebellopontine angle tumors and a control group of 181 cases with sensory hearing losses in order to quantify threshold discrepancies.	0.5590966355360197
The average deficit of the objective ABR threshold (DOABRT) to the subjective pure-tone threshold for those frequencies between 1-6 kHz was 3.6 dB for the control group (ABR and pure tone thresholds very close) and 31.2 dB for the tumor group (ABR threshold much higher than the pure-tone threshold).	0.7714439829539761
ABR thresholds 30 dB higher than the high-frequency pure tone thresholds were found in 40.6% of the tumor group and in none of the control group.	0.8529264289756754
Thus, deficits of the ABR threshold >30 dB can be considered to be an additional criterion for detecting retrocochlear disease and increases ABR sensitivity for tumor detection even if responses are absent.	0.6605325478649615
The association of nevus flammeus with mongolian spot, nevus fuscoceruleus, nevus spilus and, with variable frequency, with nevus anemicus has been termed phacomatosis pigmentovascularis, a genodermatosis first described by Ota and co-workers.	0.6038780891461145
Four different combinations have been specified.	0.31539895356894476
Most cases are reported from the Japanese literature.	0.6030674909408233
Phacomatosis pigmentovascularis may constitute an exclusively cutaneous disorder, but overlapping with other syndromes like Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome or Sturge-Weber syndrome is also possible.	0.45153089546599523
We report a 30-year-old woman with nevus flammeus on the back and right arm associated with nevus fuscoceruleus on the back.	0.6608084754195401
ORIF management of unstable trochanteric fractures of type A3 of the A0 classification is difficult because of lateral dislocation of the proximal fractured segments, particularly when only the sliding hip-screw is used for fixation.	0.6492876399489447
A connectable butt-press plate was recently developed in order to prevent this type of dislocation.	0.44792601438650664
We review the results with this fixation technique in 22 elderly patients with an average age of 76 years who presented with highly unstable trochanteric fracture of the A3 type.	0.6653408408715333
Three patients died of diseases unrelated to the trauma or operation before the fractures had healed.	0.5450012224920966
The other 19 were followed prospectively until fracture healing had occurred.	0.344901376109584
Complaints, leg shortening and changes in the CCD angle were recorded.	0.5398672734445611
Furthermore, the mobility score was determined.	0.5826518515547936
Although the patients were able to bear full weight after the operation, no lateral dislocation of fragments was observed.	0.6168536694577514
Only 1 patient had a varus dislocation of 5  ° until the fracture had consolidated.	0.6428341254688376
This was due to severe osteopenia and subsequent dislocation of the screw within the femoral head.	0.5532671473800357
No pseudarthrosis, osteitis or rotational malalignment was noted.	0.33711953832320335
Five of the surviving patients had a lower mobility score after fracture healing as compared to the status before the fracture was sustained.	0.6316204703196783
On the basis of this review, we recommend the use of this new connectable buttress plate with sliding hip screws because it provides sifficient fixation of highly unstable fractures of type A3.	0.7490745836711004
Superficial leptomeningeal hemosiderosis is a rare disease of the central nervous system.	0.6779882809345698
Chronic bleeding into the subarachnoid space causes deposition of hemosiderin in glial cells and subsequent damage to adjacent brain tissue.	0.3238974574298383
There is a characteristic predilection for the cerebellum and eighth cranial nerve.	0.5293306461303069
Accordingly, among a variety of symptoms, cerebellar ataxia and sensorineural hearing loss progressing to total deafness commonly occur.	0.4685470493786968
To date, the hearing loss has been believed to be purely neural.	0.5214270134909476
We present a case of superficial hemosiderosis in a patient with total deafness who was successfully provided with a cochlear implant.	0.6528182095000439
Audiometry demonstrated total bilateral cochlear hearing losses but with preserved function of the eighth cranial nerve.	0.3532448276122135
These findings make us conclude that in contrast to current opinion, superficial hemosiderosis can initially damage the cochlea alone.	0.47465768757854343
Thus, patients with total deafness due to this disorder may benefit from cochlear implantation.	0.6308590266429096
All patients require careful audiometric assessment, including promontory stimulation.	0.5130182349630018
Intracardiac masses remain a challenge for imaging diagnosis.	0.39978089860041943
Although most lesions are initially detected by echocardiography, additional imaging studies, i.e., magnetic resonance imaging and electron beam computed tomography, are commonly requested.	0.5824538177637927
Features and limitations of these two imaging techniques are illustrated and briefly analyzed.	0.6080885666825028
For the first time, the present study assessed the achievable predictive value of early self-experienced neuropsychological deficits for the fater development of schizophrenia.	0.5989546277981527
Ninety-six patients with DSM-III-R diagnoses mainly of the formerly neurotic or personality disordered field, of whom 81 % had shown such basic disorders at the time of the index examination and therefore were classified as persons at high risk of developing schizophrenia, were re-examined for schizophrenia.	0.7162123246773181
After an average follow-up period of about 8 years, more than half of the re-examined sample had developed a schizophrenic disorder according to DSM-III-R.	0.6968968286172671
The outcome of schizophrenia versus no schizophrenia was predicted correctly in 77 % of cases by the presence or absence of self-experienced disturbances of perception, thought, speech or action.	0.6219611803026031
To date, at least 12 types of primary dystonia can be distinguished on a genetic basis.	0.6763276608928971
A 3-bp deletion in the DYT1 gene causes early onset, generalized torsion dystonia (TD), and mutations in the GTP cyclohydrolase I and the tyrosine hydroxylase genes result in dopa-responsive dystonia (DYT5).	0.4672206146962581
A missense change in the D2 dopamine receptor in one large family (DYT11) has recently been implicated in myoclonus-dystonia.	0.48923654962735735
Furthermore, seven other loci for dystonia genes have been mapped to chromosomal regions, including a locus for a mixed dystonia phenotype (DYT6), one form of focal dystonia (DYT7), three types of paroxysmal dystonia (DYT8-10), X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (DYT3), and rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (DYT12).	0.5626804694547461
No positive linkage results have yet been obtained for autosomal recessive TD (DYT2) and several other families of different types of dominantly inherited TD (DYT4).	0.4883099927227068
In addition, hereditary secondary dystonia may occur as part of familial diseases of the basal ganglia, metabolic and storage disorders, and various X-linked and other familial neurodegenerative syndromes affecting the basal ganglia.	0.5995818781208128
It may be anticipated that the traditional clinical and etiological classifications of dystonia will increasingly be replaced by a genetic one and that the identification of more dystonia genes may lead to a better understanding of these largely nondegenerative disorders.	0.5530585476923384
In this study we investigated whether, in conjunction with neuroleptics, a psychoeducational and cognitively oriented treatment for schizophrenic outpatients and their key-persons can improve the course of schizophrenic illness within a 2-year follow-up.	0.7118856136182798
This prospective randomized study covered a total of 191 schizophrenic patients (according to DSM-III-R) and comprised a psychoeducational training and cognitive psychotherapy for patients and counseling for their key persons in various combinations.	0.5633606400946096
Patients were examined before, immediately after and 2 years after the end of the intervention.	0.7710373859200486
Patients in the treatment groups reduced their overall psychopathology and their attention deficit.	0.7140397039630383
For patients receiving all three treatment conditions, there was a relevant preventive effect with regard to the rehospitalization rate appearing during the second year of the follow-up.	0.6204717166334698
We conclude that in the mid-term, a combination of psychoeducational and cognitively oriented therapy for patients and their keypersons can improve the course of schizophrenic illness.	0.7441618255056729
Background: Cigarette smoking is common during pregnancy and can expose the developing fetus to transplacental carcinogens, but relatively little information is available on fetal uptake of such compounds.	0.5048371711550179
It was the aim of the present study to analyze the first urine of newborns of mothers who did or did not smoke for metabolites of the tobacco-specific carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) as well as nicotine and cotinine.	0.7833429242270897
Recently there has been an increase in the prevalent HIV infected population in Germany because of declines in progression to AIDS and death while the number of newly infected patients remains constant.This increases the potential value of both current and new approaches to disease prevention.	0.5327782399494768
Post exposure prophylaxis (PEP), defined as treatment of a person who has been exposed to an HIV infected person by a route through which transmission is possible, is one possible way to decrease the number of new cases.	0.6223324413622069
Economic evaluation can help to answer the question whether PEP should be provided to different exposed populations or whether the resources that would be used for PEP should be used for other HIV prevention or treatment interventions.The value of PEP depends both on the costs and effectiveness of the intervention.	0.607625981246734
In this paper, we use examples from the literature to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of PEP in different population subgroups, including those occupationally exposed, those exposed through unprotected sex, and those exposed through IV drug use.	0.7404237383494681
The cost-effectiveness of PEP is also compared to literature estimates of the cost-effectiveness of other prevention activities.	0.5555767236676729
The aim of this study was to access the importance of the laparoscopic colorectal resection.	0.5482886141665598
Of 131 patients 80 were operated on laparoscopically.	0.3208325970405881

A total of 47 patients suffered from cancer.	0.4652203044209474
Curative resection was performed in 41 patients (87 %).	0.705385716875287
For comparison, 48 patients who underwent open resection were used.	0.6645344884168852
The complication rate was lower after laparoscopy and no reoperation was performed.	0.4331484866651004
Patients recovered quicker and their first oral food intake and bowel movement were earlier.	0.3446567101330715
Hospital stay was shorter (15.3 vs. 8.1 days), and pain at rest and in motion was significantly reduced.	0.8427800045370448
Equal numbers of mesenteric lymph nodes were retrieved; adequate margins of resection could be obtained and the length of resected bowel did not differ.	0.5332702730850274
No port metastases were observed.	0.2251990756708501
Reduced morbidity, reduced hospital stay, reduced abdominal pain, quicker reconvalescence, and reduced overall health care costs are strong arguments in favor of laparoscopic colectomy.	0.6504353990587765
In the field of traumatology, compartment syndromes of the lower extremity are often seen after fractures and direct injuries, or after ischaemia.	0.6736269204326815
Other causes include over-exertion and non-traumatic causes such as acute rhabdomyolysis, drug-induced myositis and eosinophilic myositis.	0.5047264164750598
This paper describes the clinical and MR course of a compartment syndrome following an ankle sprain.	0.5961451416824417
Each patient has the right of a dedicated pain therapy according to the state of the art.	0.6642952528303945
However an efficient pain therapy is not possible without knowing the cause of pain.	0.6977147872739331
In most posttraumatic pain situations peripheral nociceptors are activated and normal afferences are conducted via an intact nociceptive system.	0.32547918449184465
In contrast, neuropathic pain pain is caused by lesions of the nervous system itself.	0.48183046332219764
Mechanisms of central sensibilization and involvement of the sympathetic nervous system may lead to chronification of such pain conditions.	0.4488007189532516
The therapeutic regime of nociceptive and neuropathic pain is demonstrated by algorithms of treatment modalities.	0.44774934295917845
Apart from classic non-opioid analgesics, co-analgesics and opioids have an important status in chronic pain management as well.	0.48205457316581607
Prescription of these substances has to follow strictly defined standards of pain therapy.	0.4754470482794189
Blockades with local anaesthetics as mono-therapy of chronic pain are obsolete.	0.5846640538076499
In posttraumatic pain, however, a certain number of adjuvant blockades or infiltrations of triggerpoints may be helpful.	0.5414054555968517

Effects of 94 different psychosocial and psychotherapeutic interventions on well-being in the elderly were meta-analyzed.	0.5368185943544693
Psychological well-being was improved and self-rated depression decreased for about half a standard deviation.	0.5507551106724299
The mean effect size for other-rated depression reached d=1.15.	0.3254462219330635
Whereas age of participants did not correlate with change in self-rated well-being or depression, other-rated depression improved less in older samples.	0.5317734245370279
High effect sizes derived from control-enhancing interventions and behavior therapy.	0.322839634061953
Sub-analyses showed that individual setting produced higher improvement than group setting.	0.30766857544032217
Higher "therapeutic" qualifications and interventions in nursing homes were associated with higher effect-sizes too.	0.37476131088375525

Human recombinant interleukin 2 (IL-2), alone or in combination with other cytokines, is currently under investigation for the immunotherapy of metastatic tumours.	0.6302275693497236
Objective responses of 20%-35% have been reported in patients with disseminated melanoma and renal cell carcinoma who received high-dose intravenous IL-2 in combination with interferon- (IFN).	0.8533398567225812
However, treatment with IL-2 is complicated by a syndrome of life-threatening adverse reactions such as disseminated vascular leakage, fluid retention, severe hypotension, and (reversible) multiple organ dysfunction (MODS).	0.7132258335227895
A systemic inflammatory reaction (SIRS)/sepsis sepsis-like haemodynamic pattern has been described in patients after IL-2 bolus application alone.	0.6824101329637174
Our purpose was to study the haemodynamic changes in patients treated with high-dose IL-2 administered as a constant infusion and in combination with IFN.	0.6859059570907339
The histopathologic diagnosis of odontogenic cysts is based mainly on the morphological nature of the epithelial lining of cysts and their origin.	0.5522965744852367
We used the international histologic classification set up by the World Health Organisation in 1992.	0.4367290074279152

The Viennese Medical School played an important role in the development of radiological examinations and signs of the temporal bone with conventional X-rays.	0.6074627888835477
Famous pioneers include E. G. Mayer (1893-1969) and L. Psenner (1910-1986).	0.47013658625016386
Nowadays conventional X-rays and tomography have lost their important role in diagnostic radiology of the temporal bone, but the basic principles established in those early years of radiology are still used now.	0.6850367087845426
This statement is correct not only for conventional X-rays, but particularly for "poly"-tomography in comparison with CT.	0.7217320163301871
The success of interventional catheter based therapy of coronary artery disease is still limited by a high rate of chronic restenosis.	0.6779608631508802
Using alternative mechanical techniques, there is increasing evidence that restenosis can be prevented in certain subsets of patients by optimized balloon angioplasty, DCA and stenting as well as by the combined approach of primary tissue removal with adjunctive stent implantation.	0.5538762344379059
This article summarizes the mechanical techniques of restenosis prevention or reduction that have been documented in controlled trials.	0.5212545705788516
Additional pharmacologic interventions and possibly genetic and/or radiotherapeutic approaches will be highly important for future reduction of restenosis.	0.410812702589154
