Commissioner, it is quite significant that at the beginning of this new century people in Europe, men and women, are being called upon to redefine their rights and obligations.	1.3958783535743648
We hope that this important Cologne Council decision will become a reality.	1.0999453991031343
Globalisation on the one hand and enlargement on the other, make it urgently necessary to define those rights.	1.128958720690807
Seattle is a real source of concern in that context and we hope that the European Council in Nice will not be a wasted meeting.	1.4354179403646496
But if we are to secure the public' s participation in this new planning, we would like to learn what plan the European bodies and specifically the Commission are proposing as the social and democratic model of Europe in the twenty-first century.	1.2861019370274114
I listened to your general guidelines and I would like to ask you what is the position of children, as entities in their own right, in the Commission' s plans for the new model of society in the twenty-first century.	1.4303509016443956
Mr President, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, in my opinion, and as Mr Prodi said this morning, the drawing up of the Charter is an exercise with great political significance. This is because it shows that the Union places the fundamental rights of citizens at the top of the political concerns for the future of our common project.	1.5514620744406218
In this context, the criteria by which these rights are to be chosen must be clearly indicated.	1.164548734137106
The essential criterion is the rights of citizens with regard to the European institutions, as contained in the European project enshrined in the Treaties of the European Union.	1.5223621222490475
I understand your concern about the rights of children.	0.7671679059820431
Many elements of our work, and particularly of my work as Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs, involve protecting the rights of children.	1.2178184625532171
This is an area in which the principle of subsidiarity applies fully.	1.2092860314102523
Each Member State is principally responsible for defining its responsibilities towards children.	0.936525658810988
As for the EU' s responsibility, the rights of children must be recognised in the Charter according to the areas in which the Union can give added value to the promotion of the social and economic situation and even the citizenship, in its broadest sense, of children.	1.498247917797244
I hope we can meet the challenge which the honourable Member has posed for the Commission and the whole Convention.	1.3216552156425418
Mr President, I have had the privilege of hearing the Commissioner a number of times on this issue and I very much agree with his approach.	1.3987476832532126
However, I should like to ask a slightly different question.	1.3026625205371174
We have just heard Commissioner Barnier say that he is anxious to communicate better with the people and to aim the information policy of the Commission towards the major issues that the Community is dealing with this year.	1.369279575933675
Would the Commissioner argue for some of the information budget of the Commission to be put towards informing and consulting the citizens on this issue of a Citizens Charter?	1.5063840477976198
It is very important that the people feel engaged in this process.	1.1166402600024197
I know that the Convention itself will do much in this area but it does not have the resources that the Commission has.	1.5945309835990162
Will the Commission look at using its information budget to ensure people are engaged in this debate?	1.112321439435895
It is the policy of the Commission to promote an open and wide debate on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, not only with non-governmental organisations but also with the citizens in a project as far-reaching as the Charter is.	1.4749220231735378
I can assure you that the Commission will do its best to promote the debate on the future Charter of Fundamental Rights.	1.1592146619819805
We can achieve the best of both worlds by having a clear text, a text that can be easily read by the citizens, and at the same time a text that can be used as a legal instrument.	1.3248049331907341
There is no contradiction between the two.	1.0872836104080956
The challenge we have is to bring them together in the final version of the Charter.	1.1768020098078287
I am very glad to know that I can count on your support here.	1.1466294848809564
Question No 40 by (H-0095/00):	0.6508713284044977
Subject: Articles 6.1, 7.1 and 7.2 of the Treaty on European Union Article 6.1 of the Treaty states that the Union is based on principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.	1.2860540020798106
It is clear from statements over the past years that Jörg Haider and the Freedom Party do not respect human rights and fundamental freedoms with respect to third country nationals and minority groups living in Austria.	1.1063274361001587
Therefore, will the Commission state when they intend to propose under Article 7.1 that there is 'the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a Member State of the principles mentioned in Article 6.1.' , and urge the Council acting by qualified majority to suspend certain rights deriving from the application of this Treaty to Austria including the voting rights of the representative of Austria in the Council?	1.2803948334810926
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin my answer by reminding you of the position adopted by the Commission with regard to the formation of the new Austrian Government. This was reiterated this morning in President Romano Prodi' s speech on that government which includes Ministers from Jörg Haider' s Freedom Party.	1.2102864313737107
I am referring ,of course, to the statement made by the Commission on 1 February 2000, the basic elements of which I would like to restate.	1.6341852949792242
The Commission confirmed then, as it does today, that it shares the concerns underlying the Portuguese Presidency' s statement of 1 February 2000.	1.5362198579636062
These concerns are legitimate and there are good reasons for them.	0.9602989934915751
There is no need for me to remind you of Jörg Haider' s political bias and of his many xenophobic and racist public statements, which are also anti-European.	1.3001289754752536
The fact that an openly extremist, racist and xenophobic party can reach power in a Member State of the European Union will inevitably be a source of concern to the other States that are taking part in the European project. The European Commission is certainly not indifferent to the matter either.	1.421300476884694
Secondly, the Commission reiterated and reiterates again its commitment to continue fulfilling its duty as guardian of the Treaties, specifically with regard to Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union.	1.1736732234802023
One of the most important innovations provided by the Treaty of Amsterdam was to clarify the basic principles which represent the shared heritage of the Member States. Another innovation was the establishment of a mechanism which would monitor whether these principles are being fulfilled, and which would react if any of them were violated.	1.3065125719001665
The Commission thereby gave a practical demonstration of its commitment to one of the essential pillars: that of the rule of law.	0.9773742812206173
This principle means that the Commission must act within the limits laid down by the Treaties and it is in this context that the statement of 1 February was made.	1.4837969139606826
The Commission is not a State. It cannot and must not act as if it were one.	1.562647713385497
In order to give a precise answer to your question, Mr Ford, I must remind you that in order for the mechanism established by Article 7.1 of the Treaty on European Union to be applied, there must be proof of the existence and I quote, of a "serious and persistent breach by a Member State of the principles mentioned in Article 6."	1.4223790613402718
I repeat, a "serious and persistent breach" is the condition necessary for the Commission to be able to propose to the Council that measures be adopted against a Member State.	1.372643502932033
I think that it is obvious that conditions have not been met which would apply to the current situation in Austria.	1.257951616306987
As a matter of fact I think that I am right in saying that we all hope that these conditions of a serious and persistent breach of human rights and of democracy are never fulfilled, either in Austria or in any other Member State.	1.3360362079537857
I would like to assure you of my personal commitment and of that of the Commission, as stated once again by President Prodi this morning, to doing everything to ensure that we do not have to apply the mechanism stated in Article 7.	1.3868494690746749
I would also like to assure you though that we will not hesitate to apply it should it prove necessary.	1.0533456546778286
The values at stake are too central, too fundamental for us to accept dithering or compromises.	1.0697650748540997
Individuals and governments should be judged by what they do rather than by what they say.	1.0485562577061167
In Austria' s case, the statements are contradictory to say the least.	0.9799969807415565
On the one hand, any of us could pick up on a whole cluster of inflammatory remarks by the leader of the Freedom Party.	1.1087249572600704
On the other hand, the new Austrian Government' s programme reaffirms its commitment to defend democracy and human rights.	1.1063874629819141
We will soon have our first opportunity, and an excellent opportunity it will be, to see which one of these two faces of the Freedom Party is the real one.	1.6053731567556224
I am referring to the position the Austrian Government will adopt at the Council with regard to the Commission' s proposals for the establishment of an action programme to combat discrimination and for two directives.	1.46831596948919
One applies to the principle of treating people equally, without differentiating on the grounds of race or ethnic origin. The other proposal will provide protection at work against discrimination on the grounds of ethnic or racial origin, religion, handicap or sexual persuasion.	1.1632478594746753
These are significant texts, adopted in accordance with Article 13 of the Treaty, which gave the Community jurisdiction to fight discrimination on the grounds of race, ethnic origin, sex etc.	1.2357271589537047
Lastly, I would like to assure you, Mr Ford, that the Commission will remain vigilant and will not fail to act in accordance with its responsibilities, should it prove necessary.	1.3534961101607068
I thank the Commissioner for his reply to my question.	0.9868422542721159
But is Commissioner Vitorino aware, not only of Mr Haider's and the Freedom Party's words, but also of their deeds?	1.4419694259869198
Mr Haider has actually been in government in the southern province of Carinthia where he has led a racist and xenophobic campaign against the Slovene-speaking minority in that region who are Austrian citizens, where he has attempted to abolish dual language education and where there has been clear discrimination against the Roma and immigrant communities.	1.1549984108331808
Could the Commissioner answer two questions.	0.586795165838213
Firstly he talked about verification.	0.5413275885383436
Can he tell us how that verification will take place and who will do it?	1.180827934742341
Secondly, does he not agree that were the current government, at a national level, to pursue the kind of policies that Mr Haider and the Freedom Party have pursued at regional level, then there clearly would be a breach of Article 6(1) of the Treaty with regard to fundamental freedom and human rights and it would be incumbent upon the Commission to take the necessary action?	1.493640252957856
We are not talking about words here.	0.9360277603175976
We are talking about deeds by the Freedom Party and Mr Haider.	0.9629841877682653
It is quite clear to me that it is the responsibility of the Commission to closely monitor the evolution of the situation in the Member States according to the procedures and standards that are enshrined in Article 6 and justify the use of Article 7 of the Treaty.	1.291083558301675
Therefore I am fully confident that the Commission will be able to follow very closely the evolution of the situation in Austria, as in any other Member State.	1.2904657343048735
If any concrete case of persistent violation of human rights perpetrated by the government of one Member State occurs, we will be entirely capable to react and to act accordingly.	1.113260040301812
I also rely not only on the cooperation of the Members of the European Parliament, but also on the cooperation of non-governmental organisations, which have always made an important contribution to the anti-discrimination policy of the Commission.	1.212672348551252
Regarding the situation in Carinthia, we need to look at this in detail.	1.3469405571244437
The honourable Member raised the question.	0.6944565156926347
The protection of ethnic minorities and of minorities that speak a specific language is an element of the programme and of the two directives that the Commission has put before the Council.	1.2981960932433854
We should not only focus this debate on the Austrian question.	1.1953772495644541
That question calls for reflection, for debate and, if necessary, for action.	1.3878632116715346
I sincerely hope that all Member States will take the opportunity of this action plan and these two directives that the Commission has presented to the Council to reiterate in clear and concrete terms their approval for the action plan and for the directives and their commitment to fight against discrimination, racism and xenophobia wherever it might occur.	1.4326872159578103
Thank you very much, Mr Vitorino, for your valuable contribution to this Question Time.	1.3745747645064639
Second part	-0.0
Questions to Mrs Wallström	0.33923132750227064
Question No 41 by (H-0021/00):	0.7262550849201995
Subject: Surplus electrical and electronic equipment Each year the European Union has to deal with a growing volume of surplus electrical and electronic equipment (6 million tonnes' worth in 1998), mainly on account of the speed with which such equipment becomes obsolescent.	1.3181662863543193
The environmental problems stemming from the incineration and the dumping of such waste are mainly attributable to the presence of hazardous substances (lead, cadmium, mercury, hexavalent chrome, PVC and halogenated flame retarders).	0.881152115634418
A preliminary draft directive intended to regulate the management of such waste has been through three successive versions, the most recent of which dates from July 1999.	1.185601082578861
Can the Commission account for the lengthy gestation of this draft, which should in theory have emerged in its final form in 1998?	1.1757778746995011
Is it true that the US Government is disputing most of the provisions of the current draft and is even threatening to appeal to the World Trade Organisation (for infringement of Article XI of the GATT and Article 2(2) of the Agreement on technical obstacles to trade) if it is adopted?	1.2069300527858848
The Commission agrees with MEPs that the current method of dumping electrical and electronic waste is causing major environmental problems.	0.9720230170905746
Consequently, the Commission decided to prepare a proposal on the subject and, since 1997, has been involved in discussions with the parties concerned.	1.6538231528927008
The outcome of the discussions, as well as of the in-depth investigations which are being carried out in this area, are now being examined by the Commission.	1.3809924331794843
Some parts of the proposal have been criticised, among them the phasing out of some heavy metals and brominated flame retardants, as well as the application of the principle of making manufacturers responsible for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste.	1.084872584031872
The United States' delegation to the European Union is concerned about certain points in the last consultation paper, inter alia the phasing out of the materials already mentioned, as well as certain questions arising from the principle of manufacturers' responsibility for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste.	1.2156328132575382
The main argument put forward by the United States in this context is that the present provisions are, they say, incompatible with international trade law.	1.4449053983295492
The Commission is currently carefully reviewing the United States' arguments.	1.3502057026341914
I should just like to add that my intention is that the Commission should be able to present a proposal on the dumping of electrical and electronic waste before Easter.	1.2015453531294
My question specifically concerned the reaction of the US Government to the text of the preliminary draft.	0.9082386702582994
There have in fact been three preliminary draft texts with the last one, to my knowledge, dating from July 1999.	1.1291656936894479
Is this the text which you will be submitting, or an amendment to the original version?	1.4347850168656637
Version 3 is already much weaker than Version 2 following the comments of US industry as relayed by the US Government.	0.9563449546353243
I note in particular that when you talk about the international law with which the text would not be compatible, you are referring in fact to the rules of the World Trade Organisation.	1.3693053559829453
The arguments of the US Government concern the fact that a future ban on the presence of dangerous substances in electrical and electronic waste would be contrary to the WTO rules.	1.2223840621250048
This worries me because this means that, when adopting texts, we are going to be continually threatened by attack from the World Trade Organisation. This will fundamentally weaken European environmental legislation and particularly this proposal.	1.3533526230513404
Thank you for the follow-up question.	0.9903045900942316
It is important for me to have a chance to answer it.	1.2973752293380385
It is clear that in a process such as this, where we are discussing the disposal of a considerable stream of both electrical and electronic waste in Europe, there is an on-going dialogue between the different parties concerned.	1.512914089231839
The dialogue has been fruitful and has led to our preparing a proposal.	1.020416420904062
Parts of it have been strengthened, but other parts may well contain too many compromises.	1.1168072967396065
We are still in the process of preparing a text, and the dialogue with the relevant parties will continue up until the last moment.	1.41557933064155
I do not think that the intervention of the United States should push us in a direction that would lead to our taking insufficient account of environmental considerations.	1.1417409630190918
I strongly oppose using the WTO and trade rules as a pretext for preventing the EU from introducing radical environmental standards.	0.8623557718977942
I start from the assumption that we should in fact introduce these.	1.131232786942473
However, I do want to listen to all the points of view.	1.329212637119446
For example, I recently met representatives of the electronics industry who put forward suggestions - including practical ones - for improving our own proposal.	1.3615133324985067
However, I totally reject any suggestion that I would allow the United States to determine the shape of our directive.	1.373562691610322
In fact, I believe that we should be showing the way, an intention that will also characterise the final proposal.	1.3320200564529006
Question No 42 by (H-0026/00):	0.6701941376120895
Subject: Gender and environment Practically all the contributors involved in the Rio and Kyoto processes - individual organisations, civic action groups, governments, the World Bank, the UN and relief organisations - believed that women should take a greater part in decision-making on the environment.	1.2700528726813347
More women in decision-making positions on various environmental bodies would extend the predominantly male terms of reference beyond business alone to embrace social justice as well.	0.9262066463397739
Is the Commission prepared to adopt an action plan to increase the active participation of women in decision-making in the environmental field?	1.1455636790728787
In 1988, the Commission introduced an action plan to promote equal opportunities for women and men.	1.3948633918839002
Through the current programme, which covers the period 1997 to 2000, we are endeavouring to encourage a workplace culture in which the value of both men and women is integrated and where gender-specific needs are taken into consideration.	1.283638618963015
One of the programme's aims is to develop and supervise methods, strategies and measures for promoting gender equality in the decision-making process and in positions of responsibility.	1.170745050023912
Within the framework of the action plan, each individual directorate general is to prepare its own programme of measures.	1.0963794216403042
One of the goals of those programmes is to increase the number of women in managerial positions.	1.1133140738859768
The new Commission's own objective is to double the number of women managers before the end of its term of office.	1.189509696477681
The same line is being pursued with particular vigour in the Directorate-General for the Environment, where nearly 60 per cent of directors and 20 per cent of unit heads are women.	1.0676630272942846
Our policy is to encourage the recruitment of women to administrative posts in order to create a reserve of suitable candidates for future promotion to managerial positions.	1.1395596050806658
Currently, women hold 24.5 per cent of our A-grade posts, and we hope the number will increase steadily.	1.2993190392206615
Moreover, we are trying hard to attract qualified women to participate in our consultation groups.	1.4632883067452516
As regards our external partners, all we can do is set them a good example and encourage their efforts to democratise their decision-making processes.	1.1777720333003936
With respect to the general principle of incorporating a perspective of equality, as you know, this principle is included in the Treaty of Amsterdam.	1.1411806228084478
Article 3 of the Treaty states that, in all the activities referred to in this Article, the Community shall aim to eliminate inequalities, and to promote equality, between women and men.	1.6734093400844465
The Commission gives its full support to the efforts being made in this area and is continuing its investigations into whether specific measures can be implemented in the environmental field.	1.1711338610882593
I should, of course, like to take this opportunity to say that I appreciate the role played by the European Parliament' s Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, particularly its chair.	1.075278584002862
I should just like to recall that, during the lengthy process of approving the present Commission, every Commissioner was questioned by the Women' s Committee on how they would tackle the issue of equality within their own particular field.	1.2111308690771685
We shall be monitoring each Commissioner carefully, so the other Commissioners have now been forewarned.	1.312022497942554
Thank you for your reply.	0.5091778424529624
I interpret it as saying that you agree that what is needed is an action plan to enable more women to take part in specific environmental fields.	1.0952180189103535
I should also like to point out that the Beijing Declaration emphasises the importance of having the institutional capacity to introduce a perspective of equality into all environmental programmes.	1.0318726710472717
Environmental agencies often do not have the required knowledge or procedures for incorporating such a perspective into their daily work.	0.9917896810960488
I naturally want to know whether the Commissioner is willing to incorporate the idea of equality into environmental policy and programmes.	1.143406524120068
This is a crucial goal.	1.4059220648294908
In order for all policies to be similarly permeated by the concept of equality, it is especially important that people in key posts should have the basic knowledge required.	1.2359973955158436
.	-0.0
(SV) My understanding of mainstreaming is, of course, that this should characterise everything we do.	1.3379233591658377
In the action plan prepared by my Directorate-General, issues of equality play a very important role.	1.2130482587121447
For example, I am prepared to give seminars on leadership or other subjects myself to encourage women to take on further tasks within the Commission.	1.2716043956895426
If we are to be able to motivate everybody, I believe it is extremely important for this message to be sent all the way from the top down or, if you prefer, from the bottom up.	1.405363811614724
My impression of environment-related work, broadly speaking, is that in many instances it is dominated by women.	1.251979913646395
This state of affairs must be encouraged so that women have a chance to secure managerial posts or reach high-ranking positions in the environmental field.	0.998353582929463
I should like to make it plain that our programme reflects that intention, but there is certainly room for improvement.	1.2563297113946126
I have some experience in drawing up plans and following them up.	0.8784221036571283
I hope that this will be of benefit.	1.2685441246233236
Question No 43 by (H-0045/00):	0.8169244138688353
Subject: The Boyne Estuary and the Drogheda Port Company The Boyne Estuary is designated a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the Wild Birds Directive and is under consideration for designation as a Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive, as it is an area of international importance.	0.9435667607171612
However, the Department of the Marine, Louth County Council and Drogheda Corporation have allowed the development of a new port in the SPA and even the elimination of a mudflat at Stegrennan recently added to the SPA specifically at the Commission's insistence.	1.2242339352936502
What is more, a very large warehouse has been constructed, in respect of which it is proving difficult to secure access to the planning permission and other infrastructures are planned by the Drogheda Corporation.	1.2441513397817652
How can the Commission ensure that this sort of development financed through the Structural Funds does not conflict with the nature conservation needs of the area?	1.1461506944859965
Is the Commission ready to suspend funding completely, pending a review of the development plans of the area?	1.1491087239671285
The Commission is aware of the construction of the harbour, but we know nothing about the warehouse or the rest of the infrastructure mentioned by the honourable Member.	1.3283862023651494
The harbour construction project is receiving support from the Structural Funds and chiefly involves dredging the river Boyne Estuary and depositing the mud on the mudflats at Stegrennan.	0.8972040262286399
The Boyne Estuary is designated a special protection area under the Wild Birds Directive.	0.550492717951741
That means that any development that takes place in or near the Boyne Estuary and that is likely to affect the special protection area must take account of the protection criteria for the area laid down in the Community' s Habitats Directive.	1.232780763798173
Since 1998, the Commission has received a number of complaints alleging that the harbour will damage the mudflats at Stegrennan, which are now designated a part of the special protection area, and that the relevant protection criteria have not been observed.	1.3773309812688526
After investigating these complaints between 1998 and the beginning of 1999 - during which time the project did not receive support from the Structural Funds - the Commission became convinced, in the summer of 1999, that the relevant protection criteria had been observed during the building of the harbour.	1.3643215404655558
An in-depth environmental impact assessment had been carried out.	0.891864291589194
The most serious harm caused by the project, the damage to the Stegrennan mudflats, was only to be temporary, and the developers were liable for completely restoring the mudflats.	1.2657126813041155
At the Commission's suggestion, the mudflats at Stegrennan were formally included in the Boyne Estuary special protection area, from which they had previously been excluded.	1.287506246211015
Furthermore, to compensate for the negative effects on the bird populations caused by the temporary disappearance of the mudflats, the intention was that other habitats in the estuary should be improved.	1.2720909362817423
However, since last summer the measure just mentioned has been in dispute.	1.487453130675501
Firstly, the Irish authorities withdrew their earlier commitment to carry out improvements.	1.0841030716118134
They then renewed their commitment after an Irish non-governmental organisation began a legal challenge in the Irish courts.	0.8824921732214831
However, the new commitment included some minor changes which, in turn, led to a further complaint.	1.3814867656680543
In view of the fact that the Irish authorities have undertaken to make compensatory improvements and that other issues have already been resolved, the Commission will not, for the present, propose that financial support from the Structural Funds should be suspended.	1.432878936713805
However, it wishes to discuss the question of compensatory measures with respect to improved habitats with the Irish authorities, particularly in the light of the continuing legal challenge in the Irish courts.	1.1492264930349876
- I do not quite understand what the Commissioner said.	1.5268343454818973
The mudflat at Stregrennan, which was made a special protection area at the request of the Commission, has been completely destroyed at this stage.	1.2774812242047866
It is clear that the activities that have taken place there are in clear breach of EU directives.	0.9915657571179737
You say there will be no further funding.	1.0039716078804968
I would like to know whether you are going to stop completely the funding at this stage until there is a proper investigation.	1.2772116026213278
If not, why not?	0.616959217326673
If you are, when exactly are you going to do it?	1.4671312455161065
Is it correct and proper that the department which owns the company is also the authority which issues the licence, and also the authority which basically takes the money from the EU and gives it to a company that it owns 100%?	1.2018489732080173
Is this right and proper?	0.7514939915601762
What is your opinion on that?	0.7969482934685723
Any EU funding for the project must be stopped because it is in clear breach of EU directives.	1.110434184635975
Even the area designated by the Commissioners as a special protection area has been destroyed.	0.9293091038927981
Compensation afterwards is not going to make up for the damage that was done.	1.1318076828988777
The first legal challenge followed the start of work on the port of development in early autumn 1999 without the compensatory habitat improvements being in place.	0.9864551840794116
As a result, the Irish authorities agreed to reinstate the cord grass removal but this time by direct mechanical means.	1.02477675316428
The use of mechanical means led to a further legal challenge - that is what I referred to also in my first answer - based on the argument that mechanical removal would damage the underlying mudflats and would cause the ecologically-harmful spread of cord grass in the estuary.	1.1898836939981046
There is to date no conclusive outcome to this legal challenge.	1.0174738338330538
The adoption of the necessary compensatory measures is a matter for the national authorities, and does not require prior Commission approval.	1.320951485353657
The Commission' s role is to make sure that the standards required by the Birds Directive are fully met, and clearly there would be a problem with compensatory measures which were themselves damaging.	1.388741804992731
In this case, the Commission proposes to seek further clarification from the Irish authorities on the up-to-date position on the compensatory measures and possible problems with the mechanical removal of cord grass.	1.0994100328284264
We are not at the moment ready to propose to stop the financing from the Structural Funds.	1.2650182414051807
Mr President, sadly, the specific case raised by Mrs McKenna is not an isolated one.	1.4664108148580888
There are other examples of conservation in special scientific areas being damaged as a result of EU funding.	1.0788575959396813
Will the Commission consider issuing instructions to all Member States saying that, if in future it discovers that European environmental directives have been breached or proper environmental assessment has not been carried out, it will not only stop future funding but will withdraw the funding already granted, in other words, reclaim the money from the Member States?	1.2208706305626966
It is only such action which will discourage this practice in the future.	1.027756015989445
.	-0.0
(SV) This is a very important question.	1.4504996453131331
As MEPs are well aware, in the course of last year a joint text was issued by our predecessors in the Commission, Ritt Bjerregaard and Monika Wulf-Mathies concerning the relationship between the Structural Funds, money from the Structural Funds and protection under the Habitats and Birds Directives.	1.191281702606624
The message contained in the joint text is still valid.	1.1068353582317807
We cannot hand out money with one hand and, with the other, take countries to court, where they may well be fined. It is therefore important that there be a coordination strategy.	1.4583978650094414
The result may, of course, be some difficult questions of priorities.	1.0479804336961416
In my view, the most important consequence, however, is that countries should do some careful thinking and, above all, make sure they send in their lists of Natura 2000 sites.	1.2370882039131827
Then we will be in a position to carry out methodical monitoring and follow-up procedures.	1.1181288584737485
In that respect, Ireland falls short, like other Member States, but we hope that the pressure we are exerting will produce results.	1.4588825119456472
I should just like to point out once again that the joint text still holds good.	1.003455093010755
The Rules of Procedure do not allow this.	0.9075678974058674
You will have to discuss this outside the Chamber.	1.1090361749816977

Question No 44 by (H-0020/00):	0.7034817422724704
Subject: Partnership arrangements and the third community support framework for Greece The recent Regulation (EC) 1260/1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds places greater emphasis than the previous regulation on stronger partnership, involving the regional and local authorities and other public bodies, the economic and social partners and all other relevant bodies not only in the preparation but also in the funding, monitoring and assessment of the measures taken.	1.2234519801975596
However, local authorities have repeatedly expressed the view that 'partnership' arrangements under the new CSF for Greece have remained unchanged and are singularly lacking in substance.	1.1376672863415789
Has the Greek Government introduced any changes so as to extend the scope of partnership arrangements to the local authorities and other representative bodies?	1.1568651137724033
In what way have the local authorities be given a greater say in the preparation and administration of the third CSF and what steps will the Commission take to ensure greater participation by the 'partners' in all measures taken under the new CSF?	1.2839980059769667
May I quickly add something to the answer given just now by Mrs Wallström to Mr Martin?	0.9617897330154472
This was a joint letter between our two predecessors and I consider, as the successor to Mrs Wulf-Mathies, that this letter is still valid. I will actively endeavour with Mrs Wallström to verify the compatibility of the projects financed by the Structural Funds with the EU environmental directives and policies.	1.3644068716662079
I am also saying this as a former environment minister.	1.1571235349109608
Turning now to the question posed by Mr Alavanos, who I hope will pardon me for this brief diversion onto another subject, the Commission has been monitoring and will continue to monitor, during the preparation of the new programming period, the application of the partnership principle.	1.481408238383085
The involvement of regional and local authorities in the Community' s action is, as you know, one of the essential elements of the new post-Berlin Structural Funds Regulation.	1.273302952143516
With regard to the specific application of this partnership principle within the next Community support framework for Greece, the Commission has noted that the public authorities were largely involved during the preparation of the Greek regional development plan for the 2000-2006 period.	1.3416911606956394
Mr Alavanos knows that I have been to Greece twice under the quite tragic circumstances of the earthquake disaster. During these visits, I held discussions with the Greek Government and raised this concern about the correct implementation of the partnership objective and requirement.	1.218981854885248
As for subsequent phases, in other words the preparation of national and regional programmes, it is not enough for this objective to be taken into account at national and theoretical level. It must also be specifically included in the programmes establishing the CSF at national, regional and local level.	1.2572211843207237
As for the monitoring and management of these programmes, I have not yet received the national provisions proposed by the Greek Government pursuant to Article 8 of the new Regulation.	1.4349394264036375
In the current negotiations on this third Community support framework, I have asked for the provisions on the partnership principle to be fully respected, with regard to both regional and local authorities and to non-governmental organisations and associations.	1.3143260734360178
Within the third CSF, this principle must specifically lead to the participation of all these partners in the monitoring committee.	1.234217497105539
This is all I can say.	0.8884230775191178
I thank the Commissioner, and do not at all question his intentions and interventions, which adopted a positive line.	1.3559038715380403
However, things are really quite different.	1.5002287238314915
The operation of the Community Support Framework is ruled by a centralising hand and indeed at this time we are experiencing state, government and party delirium as regards the European Union' s funding.	1.333224873188974
I cannot show you the television programmes here but I can show you the Greek newspapers from a few weeks before the elections.	0.9812761630546242
In the Sunday papers all over Greece: the Ministry of Public Works concerning the structural fund: the Minister' s work; the Ministry of Agriculture: the Minister' s work - just a few weeks before the elections - the Ministry of Telecommunications: the work of the Minister for Telecommunications; the Ministry of Education: the work of the Minister for Education and a photograph of the Minister; the Ministry of Employment: the work of the Minister for Employment, a photograph of the Minister and a photograph of the State Secretary, and behind them all the symbols of the Community Support Framework.	1.2369899703897815
There are only a few weeks to go before the elections.	1.110141827457333
This is both propaganda by the party and propaganda by the candidates, financed by the European Union, the CSF.	1.0614747204462833
My question to the Commissioner is this: what is to be done?	1.5196851285622006
Will the Commission remain silent?	0.752318228539183
Will it discuss the matter?	0.5551916089545204
Will it bring it up with the Greek Government or will we persist with the pathological situation we had with the previous Commission?	1.081399718090463
Mr Alavanos, I see that you have thrown to your left all the documents which you have just cited.	1.34975609121732
Would you let me have these documents so that I can read them, after I have had them translated? I can then determine what they contain in terms of information and communication, which I can only welcome as the Commissioner for Regional Policy, and what is propaganda.	1.598815872151764
Then if it is really necessary for me to do this, I will make comments or recommendations to the Greek Government.	1.3872812167523738
I would therefore be very pleased if you could pass me these documents or I will come and get them from you later on.	1.2766488232345377
Having said that, I thought your question related more to the partnership issue.	1.301565772707872
Further to your questions on the pre-electoral period, I can only repeat my intention that local and regional authorities should be involved together with non-governmental organisations.	1.2304726740677323
I can only quote what is contained in the general Structural Funds Regulation which specifies that the Commission will work with the governments of the Member States. It is therefore the Greek Government which is my primary partner.	1.4763566552605958
Subsequently, if I need to ensure that this partnership is disseminated and decentralised, then I will do this.	1.4274346446711494
I cannot do other than work with the Greek Government.	0.8254144234229922
I think that my colleague Mr Alavanos will be giving all these particulars to the Commissioner so that he may be aware of them, because this really is propaganda and not just some way of promoting Community programmes.	1.4171359853943748
However, turning to the substance, I should like to ask the Commissioner to bear in mind the following: that for all national and regional programmes, Greece is regarded as a region which expresses itself - at the level of its partnership relations with the European Union - via its central administration, its central government.	1.414992563912624
From that point of view, neither local governments and much less non-governmental organisations, for example the farming cooperatives which would be interested in further development of the farming sector, have any involvement in the formulation of proposals for the third Community Support Framework, nor have they had any involvement in the previous CSFs.	1.1924167970983561
What can the Commission do about that?	0.8891613503815351
Mr Theonas, I can only repeat what I said to Mr Alavanos.	1.2756023546976976
I will monitor this situation very closely. If necessary, within and pursuant to the Structural Funds Regulation, I will make comments on the use made, not of Structural Funds which are not yet committed, but of the negotiations prior to the allocation of these Structural Funds.	1.5349095415235285
However, I am obliged to respect the national authority with which I must conduct these negotiations.	1.3767162416276637
Having said this, I will look at the situation objectively.	1.3805721421240114
As for the rest, if you have any recommendations or suggestions on the involvement of a particular structure - I think you spoke of a cooperative structure - I am ready and willing, on the basis of suggestions from MEPs - you will be acting within your role and I within mine - to relay these suggestions, provided that they respect the spirit and letter of the Structural Funds Regulation.	1.4497882720674191
Why would I not say that we have noticed in previous years, on the part of the Greek Government, some shortcomings in the application of the new Regulation and the previous regulation in terms of involving representatives of civil society?	1.3954745693544817
I am saying this objectively and when a problem or shortcoming is noted, this must be remedied.	1.1735794628243563
I will therefore monitor this in the implementation of the new Community support framework.	1.2670473180508892

Question No 45 by (H-0041/00):	0.6448059134680388
Subject: Structural Fund financing of research in the civil nuclear technology field Can the Commission confirm that in the last Structural Fund programming period, 1994-1999, no assistance was granted to research in the nuclear fusion or fission areas?	1.2370145162495965
Can it also undertake to rule out any measures providing financing for research of this type during the negotiations in progress with the Member States on the plans and programmes for the new 2000-2006 period?	1.2544562291733923
What role will aid from the Structural Funds play, on the other hand, in the promotion of renewable energy?	1.2293549381988533
Can we expect that Structural Fund financing relating to energy policy will focus on the promotion of regional, renewable energy sources?	1.1011037030821686
Will the Structural Funds also finance the large-scale energy transmission networks?	0.837863797773138
On Mrs Isler Béguin' s first point I must remind her that the improvement of the scientific basis and technical capacities of the regions in order to increase their competitiveness was one of the Community' s priorities during the previous programming period.	1.2153676162688176
The support allocated by the Structural Funds for technological cohesion, or research and technical developments, within the Community support frameworks for that period is estimated at approximately EUR 7.5 billion.	1.2554789044763683
This is about 6% of the whole Community contribution.	1.4528114096881168
With regard to your specific concern, I can say that, as in the previous period, the Commission does not intend to directly finance through the Structural Funds research and technical development in the area of nuclear fusion or fission.	1.355378234664024
However, it is still the responsibility of the Member States' management authorities to select the projects to be implemented within these CSFs.	1.443554506168651
Consequently, even though this is not a Community priority, a Member State can decide to finance research and development projects in the civil nuclear technology area, provided that these projects contribute to regional development. The Commission does not have to be systematically informed of these.	1.5716689542434126
On your second point of renewable energy which, as you know, is of great interest to me, the Commission' s approach is given in the document on the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Funds.	1.304546808374362
These Funds specify that investments in the renewable energy sector must be encouraged where they favour the development of local resources, where they contribute to reducing dependency on energy imports and where they create jobs at local level.	1.1117766886477471
I was able to verify this, for example, during a visit I made to the Azores in Portugal a few days ago with regard to a natural source of renewable energy.	1.2585408182243456
The Structural Funds contribution which has enabled greater penetration of the renewable energy market was also underlined in the campaign to promote renewable energy sources launched by the Transport and Energy Department.	1.0860049118012798
Finally, on large-scale energy transmission networks, the guidelines also provide for financial participation from the Funds to develop these networks where this helps to reduce dependency on an external supplier or to combat the effects of isolation.	1.2626373915386595
This is particularly valid for the region of the Azores which I have just mentioned and also for all most remote regions. It is also valid for certain regions handicapped by their isolation due to mountains, for example.	1.4409881974359475
Commissioner, thank you for your answer. However, I asked this question because we are rightly concerned that the report on the third framework programme for research contains a project entitled 'International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor' .	1.2185766956899877
This project amounts to several billion ecus and areas eligible for Structural Funds, such as those listed in Objective 1, might welcome this type of installation.	1.0293960195337923
We would like to know whether the Commission would be likely to finance this type of project in terms of the installation of this research site rather than directly in the specific 'nuclear research' context.	1.1995208609101433
You did not fully answer the last part of my question on large-scale energy transmission networks.	0.8544058147670872
Could you please give an answer on this issue?	1.0880963676614888
You are concerned about whether the Structural Funds will be used to finance the installation of nuclear plants anywhere.	1.1515819305643178
Quite simply there is no question of this.	0.9242987938073683
I said that the selection of projects remains the responsibility of the Member States pursuant to the Structural Funds Regulation.	1.0634325047670983
As a result, the Commission services are not systematically informed of all projects selected.	1.3544855650720138
However, you are right to question me as this is your task, as mine is to answer you.	1.4597445375645604
As has happened in the past, the Member States are required to provide answers when the Commission questions them or asks for clarification.	1.1948862421712352
I will therefore step beyond the confidence usually shared between Member States and the Commission and I will find out exactly what is happening on this specific point.	1.3310160348656765
The Member State or States concerned will then be required to answer me and I will send you this answer as soon as possible.	1.1204841699009112
I thought I had answered your question on large-scale energy transmission networks.	0.667513784076885
The energy situation varies widely from region to region in the European Union. Assistance from the Structural Funds could be justified in certain cases and for certain regions, particularly in the case where the connection to basic energy networks is still underdeveloped.	1.2134223456568614
This is the only answer I can give you on the link between large-scale energy transmission networks and the Structural Funds.	1.0166116366350082

Question No 46 by (H-0052/00):	0.7400837165570845
Subject: Structural Funds and additionality In the light of the Commission's recent helpful response to my priority Written Question about Structural Funds and additionality, I wish to ask whether the Commission has any plans to seek amendment of the rules concerning additionality.	1.5113769212741708
In particular, would the Commission look favourably on a change in the rules to ensure that additionality operates not only at the level of Member States but also within Member States, with regard to budgetary provisions between central government and internally autonomous regions or countries?	1.20671625777529
Mr MacCormick, the Commission has no plans to amend the rules concerning additionality which were stipulated, for the 2000-2006 period, in Article 11 of the general Regulation on the Funds.	1.5464945077568961
As in the past, these rules state that the additionality principle applies to the relationship between the Structural Funds and all development expenditure of the Member State.	1.28002803569628
In this respect, it must be stressed that it is the expenditure financed by the Structural Funds which must be additional.	1.2763859966272195
The cofinancing provided by the Member State does not need to be additional to its existing expenditure.	1.1699445638814614
Provided that the Member State does not reduce all its own expenditure, the Structural Funds are added to the national expenditure and the principle of additionality is therefore respected.	1.0516747181081003
As for the budgetary provisions within the Member States, between central government and internal autonomous regions or countries, these are determined according to exclusively national considerations and are therefore not affected by additionality within the meaning defined in the rules.	1.217648193767875
Please excuse this very legal answer.	0.6216203910089934
However, after verification it is precisely in this legal manner and specifically according to the post-Berlin Structural Funds Regulation that we must define and read the additionality principle.	1.4744998905121283
- I am grateful for a clear answer though naturally a little disappointed by its content.	1.2903069585661455
We are left with Article 11(1) which says that the appropriations of the funds may not replace public or other equivalent structural expenditure by the Member States.	1.0428947821377483
Very well: that is to be the unchanging rule.	1.4770982062592377
Does section 11(1) conceivably authorise the following practice.	0.7978047113222746
When an autonomous region's or country's funding from European structural funds increases, the state makes a concomitant reduction in central funding to that region, so that the total funding package available matches a formula set nationally without regard to the quantum of structural funds granted by the Union.	1.1219726480329115
Is that really authorised?	0.5248431842211574
Unfortunately I do not have time to go into depth on this issue. If Mr MacCormick would be satisfied with my partial agreement with his reasoning, I will give him a full answer in writing by restating the legal bases of both Article 11 in general and Article 11(1) in particular.	1.4260540570367475
I am aware of the Member' s competence on these matters.	1.2749976117113146
I also know the particular problems in your constituency in Scotland where disputes and discussions are occurring on these subjects.	0.9723670455918477
However, on a general level, I would say that in all cases it is the Structural Funds expenditure which must be additional. This is how, provided that the Member State does not reduce all its own expenditure, the Structural Funds can be added to the national expenditure and we can consider that the additionality principle is respected.	1.4602198969823952
I will go further in the written answer which I have promised in order to set things out more objectively and precisely.	1.204532035469649
- Additionality is a major issue too in Wales, which I represent.	1.2547315480405368
Just last week it was one of the issues that brought about a vote of no-confidence and the resignation of the First Secretary of the National Assembly of Wales.	1.2560515434105681
As recently as 1991 and 1992 the Commission won a battle with the UK over additionality, at that time linked to the RECHAR funding.	1.1120486466225392
This led to an agreement being signed whereby the UK Government agreed to introduce procedures to ensure that EU spending reached the areas for which is was intended and was actually additional.	1.149384565678644
And yet we still have these problems in Wales and in Scotland.	1.1128315099253816
Could the Commission look at this particular situation in relation to the agreement that was signed with the UK Government?	1.406724026593099
I take this to mean that the debate of which I was aware in Scotland is also occurring in Wales.	1.264365902440926
I will verify this point and, if you wish, I will give you a written answer at the same time as the one I have promised to Mr MacCormick.	1.4107078450717792
Question No 47 by (H-0088/00):	0.7717834173373123
Subject: Amount which Andalusia will receive from the Structural Funds for the 2000-2006 period According to the Commission' s estimates and on the basis of the criteria established at the Berlin Summit (which include per capita GDP, the unemployment rate and the population census updated in accordance with the 1996 register of inhabitants), what amount is to be allocated to Andalusia from the Structural Funds for the 2000-2006 period?	1.2886818798801456
Questions to Mr Bolkestein	0.5998167413901193
Mr President, I will try to be brief in answering the Member' s question. The regional development plan submitted by the Spanish authorities on 29 October does not indicate how the Community funds will be allocated among the Spanish Objective 1 regions and therefore what your region of Andalusia will receive.	1.2771347953644796
As I did not fully understand the plan, I contacted the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs, Mr Rato, in a letter of 14 December which I have here, to ask him for more information on the document submitted.	1.542908943012998
In the coming weeks, the Commission will start negotiations with the Spanish authorities with a view to drawing up the Community support framework for the new period of 2000-2006. During these meetings I can assure you that the Commission will obtain the clarifications required on the regional allocation.	1.4400388111100333
Therefore, if you wish, as soon as I have this information by sector and region, I will personally send you the information on Andalusia.	1.5494159969530499
Mr Commissioner, the problem is that when Mr Aznar comes to the European Union to receive money for all the people of Andalusia, he counts all of them, but when he goes to the Andalusia Council to pay for services, he fails to notice 400 000 Andalusians, and this is very serious, because 400 000 children are the equivalent to the whole of Strasbourg or a city larger than Granada, full of children.	1.4378420712327604
This question is very important and I would like to know - since this is a kind of 'baby fraud' - whether the Commissioner will see to it that these funds are not taken away from the Andalusians, so that the funds which the European Union are going to pay to Andalusia, based on the census, will take into account these 400 000 children which Aznar does not count when it comes to providing them with schools and services.	1.4397742295569969
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I would ask all of you - and do not take this as a warning - to deal with strictly Community matters.	1.5440030194955527
I know that these are very important issues in Spain and there are differing viewpoints.	1.3811059001920747
I would point out to the Commissioner that Mr Aznar is the President of the Spanish Government.	1.1707013114599927
You may answer the question.	0.5716098163636012
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I hear that you have a strong voice. I hope it is loud enough to be heard in Madrid for I realise that what you have said was not strictly intended for me.	1.424279380125174
I have given you my answer.	0.7121147892592761
I am keen that the Structural Funds, particularly those in Objective 1, are allocated where needed.	1.1917067210615442
We have criteria which are applied and we know roughly what each of the regions of Europe should or could receive.	1.1765301511652322
I can only say that I must discuss these matters with the national authorities and government of each country. I am not avoiding the issue but I must abide by the general Regulation.	1.53879308076486
It is the responsibility of these authorities and governments to allocate the funds as objectively and fairly as possible.	1.0285046284288886
I need to know about this allocation, however, and this is why I said that I could not answer today.	1.4623975291074078
As I did not have an answer, I wrote to the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs on 14 December.	1.3027930166931205
I am about to lose patience at not having received an answer from him but I will send you this when I get it.	0.9967905703857101
I regret that the Commissioner has once again become involved in an imaginative and, in this case, passionate intervention.	1.1655954050742832
I would like to remind all of you that Spain is about to hold elections, and in fact there are just 25 days left before the elections.	1.42030442114173
It should be of comfort to the Commissioner that these elections will take place in 25 days time, since after that he will probably not have to deal with this type of question again.	1.4124657036583121
I do believe it is important to say that Andalusia is going to receive 50% more within the Community support framework and that Spain also holds the record for the use of the Structural Funds, which means that the distribution is based strictly on the implementing regulations and is decentralised by means of the regional development plans and different Community support frameworks.	1.2867957727874195
Lastly I would like to ask the Commissioner a specific question: Do you consider it necessary to change the implementing regulations for the Structural Funds or do you consider the current distribution criteria to be acceptable?	1.24927924466044
This is a fascinating debate which I realise is not totally Community-related.	1.1803125076279044
Having said this, we must accept that elections are always taking place in the countries of the European Union.	1.1474971859118093
I am pleased that the Structural Funds are the subject of discussions in Greece and Spain.	1.1384880311452246
We were talking a short while ago in this House about debates involving our citizens, about public debates.	1.1973285059015768
The more we talk about Europe and what Europe is doing for daily life, even when we disagree, the better this will be, provided that we talk about this objectively.	1.3791857498039142
I am not going to give an opinion on any amendment to the Structural Funds Regulation.	1.1291254336913408
This Regulation was adopted just last year in Berlin and I will be applying it for the next seven years.	1.3111247351665785
We will talk about this issue during the cohesion report which I regard as an important time for making an assessment with and before this House and for outlining future prospects. The time will come at the beginning of next year for any amendments to be highlighted.	1.2079853785848342
For the time being, please let me apply the Regulation which has not yet been applied as it was only approved in Berlin.	1.2599029566996547
This is all I can say today.	0.945954654909784
Thank you very much for your replies, Mr Barnier.	1.2836083764070245
Questions Nos 48 to 50 will be replied to in writing.	0.4659073833672202
Question No 51 by (H-0049/00):	0.7382905583698957
Subject: New premises for the OHIM At present the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (OHIM) is still operating from the same temporary premises, even though its new building was opened in June 1999.	1.2322463512054866
In view of this unusual situation, will the Commission say why the OHIM has not yet moved to its new premises?	1.292990951249288
The honourable Member asked a question on this topic in November 1999 and I would like to refer him to the answer given at the time.	1.2040891458939493
Furthermore, I have asked the president of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market, that is to say the Office in Alicante, to comment further on this new question and I can, as a result, inform the honourable Member as follows, on behalf of the Office:	1.4370709693581067
The Office is not yet ready to move into the new building.	1.065411496467664
Unfortunately, a number of deadlines have been exceeded.	1.225109013425682
A number of technical provisions need to be made, such as the installation of a computer network, archives, a canteen and furniture.	1.1344575004113353
The OHIM is now in the process of arranging this and is expecting to move into the new premises by June.	0.9308116346822005
During the previous question, we were discussing electoral issues.	1.4430421189278009
I believe that this issue is relevant to my question. Commissioner, you were not present at the extraordinarily named 'official opening' of the headquarters of the OHIM on 9 June, in the middle of an election campaign in Spain leading up to both the European elections and the local and regional elections.	1.3536150491168097
If you had been there, I am sure you would have been ashamed.	1.4484748965010128
The President of the Commission and some secretaries were present.	1.1411812896345837
In the middle of an election campaign, a series of authorities, all of them run by the party in government, made clearly electioneering speeches which, furthermore, were broadcast live on television.	1.271511328844977
It was bizarre to see the President of the Region of Valencia praising the work of the Spanish Government, as well as his own work, although it was irrelevant to that event.	1.3157524224030952
The opening of a building which was not finished, in the middle of an election campaign, which eight months after the opening can still not be occupied, makes the Spanish Government look ridiculous.	1.2539281545036585
I am not worried that the Spanish Government should look foolish, because at the end of the day it was their responsibility, but it does worry me that the Commission should look foolish by endorsing, through its presence, this absurd event.	1.5540936873250542
I would therefore like to ask you, Mr Commissioner: does it seem normal to you that an unfinished building should be opened during an election campaign?	1.186055059882734
Does it seem normal to you that the Commission should attend such an absurd event organised by the Spanish Government?	1.079542565976672
It does not fall within my remit to make statements about internal political situations within one Member State or another.	0.9771003277587705
As such, I would prefer to withhold any comment on the situation which Mr Berenguer has just described.	1.370371451677308
I have to confess that I fail to comprehend why a certain opening ceremony was held in Spain.	0.9360148453098817
What I can say is that I hope that this building will now be occupied as soon as possible.	1.2724408313745248
May I also add that I hope to be in Alicante myself at the end of May to speak at a conference.	1.3378509863818555
I hope that this building will then be occupied.	1.0604399269651767
I would like to point out to the Commissioner that it is not an electoral question.	1.2791614106480456
As members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, we have followed the creation of that institution and it is clear that it was established for electioneering reasons.	1.2633012747512555
A year later, it is still not functioning, which means that the Commission spent money on a false opening.	1.3458861832470523
We should ask ourselves to what extent this spending of funds was justified.	1.079726193273878
I would like to reiterate that the Commission is unconcerned with the underlying motivation of Member State actions.	1.3369075864014812
It is, however, interested in official statements and actions.	1.0116963015554765
We do not intend to go in the direction of what is termed in French un procès d'intention.	1.0420230739944958
We are concerned with public official actions and events, rather than any possible underlying motivation.	1.1618549459165173
This is why I find it also difficult to meet Mr Medina halfway and respond to his question.	1.178728079094427
Once again, the Commission does not speculate why something is happening earlier or later than planned. It only appreciates that a building for this Office is opened and occupied as soon as possible.	1.0889706834728792
Also, the Commission does not engage itself in finding out whether certain expenditure was real or virtual.	1.1212074288694533
As far as I am concerned, all expenditure is real.	1.0969173609328176
And any remaining skeletons, I intend to leave them in the cupboard.	1.0932863908393302
Question No 54 by (H-0117/00):	0.7393607605097905
Subject: Alcohol monopoly and the internal market What action does the Commission intend to take in order to prevent the extension of the State alcohol monopoly apparently being planned by Sweden, and the associated import restrictions, and to ensure that the rules of the single market are applied?	1.4159847967684993
I would like to answer these two questions as follows.	1.1980239418193601
When Sweden joined the European Union, it was allowed to retain quantitative restrictions on alcoholic beverages which travellers can bring into the country from other Member States.	1.178341957356539
This derogation from the principle of the free movement of goods lapses on 30 June of this year.	0.9214755624584049
Sweden now wants to extend this measure by another five years, as this would be necessary to protect public health.	1.1976300379031866
My position on this is clear.	0.9214826129213236
Sweden has now had sufficient time - since its accession to the Union - to adapt its policies to a situation where such import restrictions do not exist.	1.2764163771849337
I cannot see a reason, therefore, why a further extension for this measure should be proposed.	1.2023440464590789
European citizens have the right to buy goods for their own use, including taxes, in any Member Sate and to take them to another Member Sate without having to subject these goods to controls and without possibly having to pay another set of taxes on them.	1.3023104922779274
That is a basic principle governing the internal market and derogations from this principle must be exceptions and must be limited in time.	1.263106040594754
We want to guarantee that Swedish citizens too can enjoy the benefits of the internal market, just like other citizens of the European Union.	1.031985177113188
This certainly does not mean that I do not share the concern in Sweden surrounding the possible health problems which can be caused by alcohol abuse.	0.9846735983125333
A recent study, carried out by Professor Lindgren of the University of Lund, however, has shown that abolishing the restrictions would not lead to a higher alcohol consumption in Sweden.	1.1562406576856972
I have already had a chance to discuss my position with Mr Ringholm, the Swedish Finance Minister on two occasions.	1.3375476979289034
I also discussed this matter with the Swedish parliamentary Finance committee last week.	0.8429538952688279
It is now up to the Swedish government to take the necessary measures.	1.372719498979343
Thank you for your reply.	0.5091778424529624
I should just like to apologise for the error in my question to the Commission. Instead of 2004, it should, of course, be 1 July 2000.	1.320143487011418
I have some sympathy with the Commission's standpoint that derogations should only be granted occasionally.	1.2939178210347932
Such a rule is only normal.	0.6410178103223488
Nevertheless, I should like to ask two questions: Are you thinking of embarking upon continued discussions with the Swedish Government about extending the derogations, for example for as long as Denmark and Finland have derogations?	1.259667299086018
My second question concerns the whole policy on alcohol.	0.8458959980476838
This may, of course, be seen as an issue concerning the internal market, but also as a public health matter for the whole EU.	1.4048281701597662
What are the respective roles of alcohol policy and public health considerations in the Commission's work?	1.3054279241438826
A Europe-wide policy on alcohol is not just an issue concerning the internal market. It also has important implications for public health.	1.342760999190845
If we had considered these aspects in their overall context, then it might have been easier to carry on a dialogue with Sweden.	1.2128410587635783
May I thank Mr Andersson for the supplement to his first question and may I answer that question as follows?	1.0482002368685
Firstly, Finland and Denmark are subject to exemptions to the basic rule of the free movement of goods until 2003.	1.1114864897661287
These countries are in the process of taking measures in preparation of free access of alcoholic products in the year 2003.	1.097784545523272
However, in the case of Sweden, the situation is different.	1.4664185547143134
In 1995, a five-year derogation period was decided upon, which is now lapsing.	1.227064568248757
I have as yet not heard any arguments on the basis of which the Commission would need to extend this period.	1.3633300362328555
Secondly, the Swedish Government is being consulted all the way.	1.367156861727845
I can inform Mr Andersson that I will leave for Stockholm on Monday, 6 March, in order to talk to Minister Ringholm, to members of the Swedish parliament, and, if necessary, also to the Prime Minister or other ministers, in order to continue discussions on this matter. I am fully aware that emotions are running high in the political arena in Sweden regarding this issue.	1.41343387446326
Thirdly, I understand very well that the health aspect of this matter is naturally important.	1.554502542956278
I would repeat at this juncture what Professor Lindgren of Lund University has stated, namely that whatever happens in terms of import restrictions, the consumption of alcohol will remain the same.	1.1696764332306393
The question is then, of course, where does the volume of alcohol originate from which is not imported by travellers?	1.31664074384827
The answer is that this is smuggled into the country or made by the Swedes themselves, and as Mr Andersson knows, this is an extremely dangerous and unhealthy activity.	1.4266866482106892
Well now, Mr Andersson seems to think that the health situation will improve if we restrict the import of alcohol.	1.3015653209724865
But in that case, not only Sweden, but all EU countries, should then be subject to a total ban on alcohol.	1.5494494501946154
We can cast our minds back to a similar situation in the United States.	0.996865771499327
Mr Andersson will be familiar with what was termed then 'prohibition' .	0.8844423269444462
He will also be aware of the effects the ban had on Mafia activity within the United States, where, eventually, prohibition was withdrawn.	1.2131659607426641
All this means that we need to protect health, of course, but not by banning alcohol, because that does not work.	1.4180894558365602
Mr President, the question at issue is the income from the Swedish alcohol monopoly and when the Swedish Government says that it must cover health costs, then this is proof of a distortion of competition because other countries must cover their health costs themselves, with no alcohol monopoly at their disposal.	1.2501282982263888
My question refers to whether you too know of studies which state that a moderate intake of good quality alcohol such as Franconian wine or Bavarian beer is good for you and would therefore also be good for the Swedish budget.	1.027208206687845
I gather that Mr Posselt has hinted at the fiscal aspects of this matter.	0.9673905551474363
I also happen to know that the high tax on alcohol products in Sweden goes back to the year 1638 and that since then, the sale of alcohol products has accounted for a significant portion of the state' s tax revenue.	1.2261390849962623
As is known, this has led to a state monopoly in Sweden which, in itself, is at odds with Union legislation.	1.2872305330324818
As to the healing effect of alcohol - to which, I believe, Mr Posselt also made reference - I could not agree more with him: I think that a good bottle of wine can be extremely good for your health and is also socially extremely pleasant, and perhaps Mr Posselt, Mr Andersson and myself could meet in the bar of this Parliament one of these days to share an aquavit.	1.5430830914193436
Mr President, I listened with interest to the Commissioner's reply about the need to apply the laws of the single market.	1.3476684123331342
I wonder whether he can say whether he considers his reply to be compatible with the failure by the Commission to take the French Government to the European Court of Justice on the application of France's Loi et Vin, which effectively prevents single market rules applying to the sale of alcohol products in France?	1.2706205567137878
Can we now expect the European Commission to take action against the French Republic before the European Court of Justice?	1.400370581794704
I should like to reply very briefly to the question raised by the honourable Member, since this matter is now under active consideration by the Commission.	1.2646995518591249
The Commission has to take a decision on whether the matter is closed or whether it should refer it to the European Court of Justice.	1.4321289795777534
My reply is perhaps not satisfactory right now, but I would like to assure the honourable Member that the Commission will take that decision within a matter of weeks.	1.3971823477095606
I ask for the Member's understanding for this small delay in the Commission's decision.	1.3882276266201128
Commissioner, do you have any reason, on public health grounds, for a difference in the taxation rates on, for example, Scotch whisky or French Bordeaux wine or even my colleague's Bavarian beer?	1.3614513523909724
Can you envisage applying an alcohol - equivalent basis for taxation in Europe?	0.8712012368512512
The matter of excise taxes, to which the honourable Member is referring, is the prerogative of the Member State concerned.	1.4283485722853073
The Commission has no instruments to enforce any particular decrease or increase in excise taxes on alcoholic products or on any other products.	1.0806479246950005
Towards the end of this year the Commission will submit a report on the differences in excise taxes between Member States.	1.1901920594258657
It will no doubt engage in a discussion both with Parliament and the Council on this state of affairs, which indicates that there are quite a lot of differences in excise rates between Member States.	1.32288531937786
For example - I believe the honourable Member referred to this - no excise taxes are applied on wine in France, whereas they are applied in the United Kingdom.	1.2537780815146513
That leads to a distortion of the internal market because wine is smuggled from France to the United Kingdom.	0.8962264766567433
The question specifically refers to the relation between excise taxes and the alcohol content of the goods subject to excise tax.	0.9326753837038994
The Commission has no means of influence here.	1.2117874898450853
In the case of Sweden, the instrument of excise taxes is indeed used to reduce the consumption of alcohol.	1.0795375262483502
Although this leads to a disparity in excise taxes between Sweden and other Member States of the Union - and that by itself increases cross-border smuggling of alcoholic products - it is a legitimate instrument to decrease the consumption of alcohol.	1.250013240771924
There is ,of course, elasticity of demand, in this case a price elasticity of demand.	1.222497345020622
I am not sure exactly what it is, but it is not zero, therefore it must have some effect.	1.4634367709990375
My question would have been almost exactly the one raised by Mr Purvis, but I would like to press the point further.	1.2634020631101444
Granted, as you say, that excise duties lie within the prerogative of Member States, nevertheless the use of that prerogative in a way which is unfairly discriminatory against producers in one part of the Community versus others might still conflict with the single market principle.	1.3507240042640432
For example, if we take what Mr Purvis and I would be thinking of, the malt whisky producing parts of the Highlands - a very peripheral part of Europe, very hard-pressed, a whole farming community as well as a distilling community dependent upon it - a general practice of taxing the alcohol in Scotch whisky, Dutch gin or Danish aquavit more than the alcohol in beer or the alcohol in wine, seems to me to be discriminatory and a discriminatory use of something which is admittedly within the prerogative of the Member States.	1.2839284304659682
May I assure Mr MacCormick and other Members of this Parliament that the present situation where excise taxes differ between Member States is indeed something which is not conducive to the proper functioning of the internal market.	1.2650658448110055
We need not restrict ourselves to alcoholic products.	0.7767507035508535
If one looks at petrol, for example, one sees that excise taxes in Germany are different from those of Holland, and consequently Dutch motorists cross the border and fill up their tanks in Germany.	1.1467243452433975
That is indeed distortion of the internal market.	0.6901072186865063
If I had my way, I would wave a magic wand and equalise excise taxes across Europe.	1.24104817513951
As a result, smuggling would no longer take place except if products were intrinsically more expensive in one Member State than another.	0.9007915744282033
But I do not have a magic wand and I do not have my way.	1.2002704624164673
This is an area of unanimity, as Mr MacCormick knows, and unless all Member States agree on the equalisation of excise taxes, it will not happen.	1.499355177357935
Once again, towards the end of this year, the Commission will forward a report on the state of affairs on excise taxes, and I am obviously available for any discussion with Parliament on that report.	1.3108849673465741
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	0.47513528222732565
Today we will take note of what you say and have a glass or two of Alsace wine, although we do not know how much tax is put on it, but I suppose it is a lot.	1.5752361496508522
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions 55 to 114 will be replied to in writing.	0.8541384455999856
That concludes Questions to the Commission.	0.4490878857968008

Community policy in the field of water (continuation)	0.8466848252387554
The next item is the continuation of the debate on the recommendation for second reading of the Community action in the field of water policy.	1.1015936476609745
Mr President, the situation regarding fresh water in Europe is not as serious as in other parts of the world but, in general terms, it is a fact that the demand for water has continued to grow and its quality has continued to decrease.	1.3953102891743998
To this we must add the water pollution problems which afflict the potential new Member States in the East.	1.0475487870729039
In fact, a reservoir containing cyanide has just burst its banks in Romania, threatening aquifers which supply the population of Yugoslavia.	1.0259674383824042
I understand that Mrs Wallström, whose presence here tonight I appreciate, is going to visit the area.	1.3156610848328887
I believe that no country, no government and, of course, no member of this Parliament can fail to recognise the need for this directive in order to end the current fragmentation of water policy and facilitate the implementation of a programme of specific measures for each river basin.	1.5217726706682795
The development of this directive has been difficult and complex, involving diverse interests and divided opinions.	1.1781738574386913
I have no doubt that the rapporteur for this legislature, Mrs Lienemann, has made great efforts and shown great dedication in reconciling positions, and has succeeded to a large extent.	1.4178309402749931
However, it is almost impossible to understand and correctly assess all the different situations and expectations.	1.316118347274518
I come from a country whose southern half is on the Mediterranean and the availability of water historically depends on the whims of an unpredictable climate and a difficult terrain.	0.9806037981823056
The Mediterranean region has had to fight for its development by trying to overcome this adversity, century after century, year after year, day after day, and is still doing so today.	1.211738829310546
Therefore, it seems essential to us that the directive complies, in practice, with the obligation laid down in article 164 of the Treaty on the need for Community legislation to take account of the diversity of its regions.	1.5418229877277232
In accordance with this principle, the Spanish delegation of the European People' s Party will oppose Amendments Nos 4 (Recital 21), 13 and 49 (Article 11(d)), since they imply a serious limitation in an area of management exclusive to the Member States, that is, the regulation of water resources.	1.4175979176385878
It would be very difficult for the Community to determine the conditions for the regulation of water in the different regions, given the different internal balances which are always in play and which require profound knowledge of the different areas and the relevant interests.	1.3466418447758792
We also reject the amendments which aim to incorporate the integral cost of water for 2010.	1.0557655108977864
We must clearly set water prices which promote its efficient use but which, at the same time, safeguard the competitivity of the producing industries in the less-favoured regions and do not hinder their legitimate development.	0.9142825695487976
I would lastly like to refer to the amendments on dangerous substances which establish that we must achieve a zero, or close to zero, degree of pollution.	1.2046684211291772
In no field of human activity have we ever discovered a zero degree of pollution.	0.8409571277225113
We will be doing a general disservice to the objectives of this important directive if we are not able to provide it with the necessary flexibility and adaptability to guarantee compliance with its provisions.	1.1960659375567297
I hope that, once again, this House will vote with a sense of reality and respect for the principle of subsidiarity, seeking a suitable balance between the environmental objectives and economic and social considerations, the three essential elements in achieving the sustainable development which we all wish to see so much.	1.3052156112125812
Mr President, Commissioner, this is a very important directive.	1.2691110805060088
Its aim is to improve the quality of water and the reliability of the water supply and sewage systems.	1.1429329449335086
The public must have a right to clean water.	1.0100941131736332
It is important not only for the environment but also for public health.	1.4105084685617162
I am not speaking so much for myself, as I happen to be one of those few lucky people in Europe who can drink water directly from their own lake at home.	1.3732735116135848
We must make sure that we get started quickly with the programme to improve water quality.	1.1365161702009374
Action must get under way immediately.	0.6340732425573746
We cannot afford to waste time.	0.6128966406847592
It is important that the timetable is an ambitious one.	1.172396351212678
In my opinion, the timetable is not too ambitious if we believe that by 2020 we will no longer allow impurities in water and we aim at zero level quantities of impurities and toxic matter by then.	1.131449516618679
It is a question of doing what is technically possible; obviously it is not possible to do anymore, but we must be sufficiently ambitious.	1.431319450691737
I would like to comment on one issue, which was spoken about earlier.	1.3981430404376027
I believe the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has restricted too tightly the debate on the transfer of water.	0.941354447013397
This is not merely a problem for Spain; it is one for the Nordic countries, and I sincerely hope that we can rely on national solutions in these matters, when they are better for the environment and the economy than what is proposed in the directive.	1.516756081378516
Mr President, Madam Commissioner, congratulations, Mrs Lienemann on an excellent piece of work.	1.735063450593443
Water and air surround us everywhere.	0.6561732885448214
We share them with everyone on this earth.	0.8260858842224983
Water is a prerequisite for human life.	0.8271060919407981
And there are more and more of us in the world.	1.1207864211053926
Mrs Schleicher intimated earlier today that clean water was an unrealistic goal.	0.7798210445957883
Nothing could be further from the truth!	0.7002196585413547
It is unrealistic to go on causing the quality of our water to deteriorate and so, too, the conditions for life.	1.237984096143641
It is especially unrealistic in regard to agriculture which is most dependent upon a clean natural environment and unpolluted resources.	1.0468065041894112
I would therefore appeal to Members of Parliament to appreciate that tough demands for a clean environment are a sign of long-term realism of the highest order.	1.238952141766281
Mr President, we - myself included - support the report by Mrs Lienemann, the targets it sets and the directive under discussion.	1.4510051265303516
However, we should look a little more closely at some points.	1.4192657176446104
For example, a major problem in my country is the diversion of rivers and the consumption of water from lakes, which people try to justify by pseudo-developmental arguments, and which, of course, are a great risk to ground waters, water tables and surface waters.	1.426841969801466
I therefore think that regardless of whether we finally conclude who should decide whether such diversions take place, the specifications common to us all must be very stringent.	1.1401818570898306
But the key issue is, in my opinion, planning how to restore water tables, the natural flow of rivers and the natural content of lakes, which must be carried out within the ten year period we have in mind.	1.2280127782500638
I think such projects ought to be eligible for funding, because, at the end of the day, that restoration may well prove to be a first-rate development policy.	1.1860122328083826
Mr President, here we have what is basically a good measure.	1.4676596097224957
It sets out achievable standards based on subsidiarity principles and the water basin management.	0.9409959642150657
Its aim of good-quality water for drinking, for wildlife, the environment and economic purposes is right.	1.3355811028847433
The prevention of pollution and water deterioration has to be right as well as the ability to manage water in times of drought and flood.	1.0804740597699625
We have three outstanding problems.	0.6904958258526993
The first is the transfer of water between basin areas.	1.047915782575093
That is a matter which affects my colleagues from Spain, Ireland and the United Kingdom.	1.3320835024556839
Amendments Nos 4. 49 and 87 would not be acceptable because they would restrict the ability of a country to move water from where it is in supply to where it is needed, be that arid areas or urban areas.	1.2925501892690536
Secondly, we have to have realistic targets, but targets nevertheless.	1.5049976879828617
Looking at Amendment No 7, for example, which calls for the complete elimination of naturally occurring substances, you can see that some of the targets set are unrealistic.	1.2513531815305319
Also, some of the targets which are set at close to zero - in English, that is quite a meaningless term.	1.4016700560557183
We need to look very carefully at those.	1.1387654168990151
The concept of continuing reduction as in Amendment No 58 is much better.	0.7904944217570986
Thirdly, I raise the problem faced by Scotch whisky.	1.312015610434387
Scotch whisky - especially malt whisky, which is the best - requires water extraction which is used in some quantity and then returned to the water stream.	1.2652250623040693
Some of it ends up in the bottle and is drunk.	0.8326497886934332
We must make sure that Amendments Nos 49 and 87 leave the deletion exemption so that whisky can continue to be drunk in "high quality", which means it must use good, Scottish peat water.	1.0363658051082327
That is my third request - that we look carefully at these measures before passing this measure as a whole.	1.269832276570869
Mr President, first of all, we want to denounce the fathomless hypocrisy of those who claim to be concerned about the environment and water, but whose criminal activities such as the attacks against Yugoslavia, aside from leaving thousands dead and wounded, have also brought about huge ecological disasters for water resources too, making them not only unusable but even extremely hazardous.	1.2421738999773901
Turning to the report, we believe that implementing the principle that the cost of water services should be recoverable must never result in additional taxation of the economically weakest strata, or even in the annihilation of small and medium-scale farmers because of the prohibitive cost of water for irrigation.	1.2908420122805968
We also wish to point out that especially in areas with acute drought problems such as my own country, and especially on the islands, funding must be provided for infrastructure for the saving of water, by increasing not its cost but its quantity. This should mainly be carried out by collecting the rainwater that now goes to waste, running off into the sea and eroding the soil, with all the problems that creates.	1.2325716235113595
In that spirit, we support Amendment No 107 by Mr Marset Campos.	1.276219317795857
River waters must also be used more effectively so as to preserve life in areas that suffer chronic drought.	1.064623847610473
Finally, as regards the Council' s allegation, which the Commission echoes, that there is no need for many specific references and explanations because they are covered by the examples given in the directive or contained elsewhere therein, this is chicanery.	1.4500565988779153
Its purpose is to preserve a semi-transparent field of action, which during the directive' s first implementation period will allow critical choices to be finalised to the benefit of big business.	1.0676747021691453
Mr President, first and foremost, I want to say that protection of the aquatic environment, both surface water and groundwater, is probably one of our most important duties of all.	1.338092687691208
That is not only because it is about guaranteeing sufficient water resources but also because it is, to a large degree, about safeguarding water resources against pollution so that we can also have clean drinking water in the future.	1.5071981072572245
We are all entitled to clean drinking water.	0.8242327614056729
I should like to express my great appreciation of Mrs Lienemann' s work on this matter.	1.1638236578301566
It has been a huge task, and I should like to express my support for all of Mrs Lienemann' s amendments. These are all improvements to the common position.	1.4428741725891947
Moreover, I shall only highlight the most important ones.	1.659192583702235
First and foremost, I think it is important that we should establish some clear objectives concerning the condition we should have achieved for our water within a period of no more than 10 years.	1.2452612775430356
I also think it is important that we should put pressure on the Member States to devise the necessary action programmes more quickly than is proposed in the common position.	1.2029351485418027
And, finally, I want to say that I think that the tighter arrangements which are being introduced in regard to payment schemes and pricing are quite proper if we, as consumers, are to be given an incentive to use water resources efficiently and, at the same time, obtain arrangements which can promote the achievement of those environmental goals about which, I believe, there is broad agreement.	1.3630395716479486
In this regard, too, I think that the 2010 deadline is appropriate.	1.0253099224184337
Finally, I want to say that I attach great importance to making a start on phasing out discharges, emissions and leaks of hazardous materials and to the fact that we can do this gradually but, at the same time, be set a target, namely the year 2020 by which time we should hopefully have reduced such emissions to zero.	1.3119565890378388
If this cannot be adopted as the objective, then I am naturally prepared to support the proposal to the effect that we should have achieved levels very close to zero by the year 2020.	1.2445374282606152
I think that Mrs Lienemann' s proposal is a good basis for further negotiations with the Council.	1.3321585470426243
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for some excellent work in drafting this important directive.	1.1050059308892712
The second reading of the framework directive on the issue of water is most timely; the shocking news of the environmental catastrophe in Romania must feature in today' s discussions and also more generally when we ponder the environmental dimension of Union enlargement.	1.2623383898308884
First of all we have to find and call to account those who are guilty of the act.	1.3526311676501679
The cyanide and heavy metals in the rivers are gruesome examples of how environmental negligence may ruin the waterways for decades to come.	0.8324494727672341
The event proves that in some countries applying for EU membership the environmental norms and environmental thinking are still light years behind the EU.	0.9793291830853699
The Union ought to reassess how aid for environmental projects can be allocated in a better way in support of a sustainable policy on water.	1.0901441744650335
With regard to the proposal for the directive it is worrying that the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy do not take sufficient account of the importance of unpolluted surface waters to increase the occurrence of clean, natural groundwater.	1.1151128259374554
In Finland surface waters are very clean.	0.6739552482404003
The production of so-called artificial groundwater is an ecological means of filtering a clean supply of fresh surface water through to the groundwater reserves.	0.9478335933115513
The process does not require a chemical sewage plant.	0.817469239655858
The directive must not be allowed to endanger this work.	0.8130081816271169
Deviating from the Council' s common position, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is also attempting to restrict further the facilities for the transfer of water.	0.9570814056221979
This would cause problems for those countries where reserves of water are unevenly distributed.	0.9884297993413022
The ecologically sustainable transfer of water must not be restricted by Union acts.	1.0153672027285643
The work should, of course, be regulated and subject to license in the future too, but the same rules cannot apply to, for example, Finland and Greece, which suffers from drought.	1.2851429708662108
Mr President, Commissioner, water is a precious natural asset, a vital necessity, and it is our duty to protect it.	1.305839412169867
I think it essential to have a framework directive on water policy in the European Union, which will be the basic legal instrument for improving the quality and proper management of water resources, and I congratulate the rapporteur on her attempt to address this thorny issue and take due account of all the points of view.	1.3964300626918176
I must say, however, that, there are discrepancies between the countries in the north and south concerning water, and that is why the matter cannot be dealt with in the same way.	1.4119221742626178
There are parts of Europe with an inherent shortage of water, and that should be taken into account by this directive.	1.312085583935212
In recent years, climate change has compelled Mediterranean countries to face serious problems of flooding or lack of rain.	0.9114710668658624
We agree with the common position but we also accept several of the amendments tabled, whose aim is to improve it.	1.3858640828142776
However, we cannot accept amendments such as those that refer to the issue of costing water, granted that in my country a high proportion of the users are farmers.	1.3770881250879636
In addition, amendments which ban the transfer of water from one hydrological basin to another would condemn many areas in my country to water shortage.	1.2559172670020444
The issue of eliminating hazardous substances ought, I think, to be made more realistic so that we can achieve it.	1.518268852076983
As for the time scale demanded for the directive' s implementation, it must be borne in mind that there are countries where creating the infrastructure for this directive' s implementation will take time and considerable resources.	1.3483756506059081
In spite of these remarks however, I believe our common objective of sustainable use of water resources can be maintained.	1.4304418399106786
Mr President, Commissioner, the measures contained in this directive range from drafting water management plans, comprehensive information and hearing rights, and close cooperation between the Member States, to combating water pollution caused by individual pollutants.	1.2620396242728462
And considering how long this Chamber has been trying to introduce a framework directive of this kind, I am pleased to be present here today, and I would like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on being in the happy position of presenting this report to us.	1.1938238907330123
However, it is also extremely important to me to point something out that many people actually take for granted.	1.4373498105546219
I would still like to highlight this point though: this directive does not constitute any kind of legal basis for diverting water from a Member State' s territory against its will.	1.1930624297142818
And by way of reaffirming this once again, I have introduced an amendment - gratifyingly with the support of a large number of Members - and I would be very pleased if Parliament would endorse my proposed amendment tomorrow.	1.2788953033483939
It is all about making it clear that water - and this is not the first time this has been mentioned today - is no ordinary commodity but a resource which belongs to the individual EU Member States and which must be protected and treated with the respect due to it.	1.3456433946963318
I am aware, and the previous speaker highlighted this, that there are States in the European Union that have problems with water.	1.6387095838557897
I believe that every one of us, in every country, could improve the way in which we manage our water and could make use of it in a cleaner way.	1.5678497297650782
This applies to every country.	0.7521213733329438
But only when each country has done its utmost to conserve its water resources, when literally everything has been done that could have been done in our own countries, only then, in my view, should it be necessary to start thinking in terms of harmonising water usage.	1.245099121681696
Mr President, Commissioner, we should be pleased that this directive has already reached second reading.	1.3836107885576578
However, I must say that I am not over-pleased because I believe that this directive is not of great quality, it is going to be very difficult to implement and has many shortcomings.	1.5263002992915768
Firstly, I believe that this directive is excessively tough, simplistic and reductionist.	1.2373930581190196
In many cases other existing directives on water have not been complied with and governments and the Commission have often not imposed discipline as they should have done, although I know that this is not pleasant.	1.4431038514230126
It is not a question of having much tougher regulations, because in many cases the problems concern management. It is not a question of exercising the relevant competences and not referring the big problems of the water systems to the legislative, the complications of which we are all well aware of.	1.3744221859090409
This is a reductionist directive. We cannot lump countries with navigable rivers together with countries which lack water, where great cracks open up in the ground through a lack of water and which see temperatures of 55ºC or 60ºC in the sun.	1.2769505631889906
I say this because the ball does not need to be in our court. This issue is in the hands of the governments and the Commission.	1.483203462252744
In the same way, this damage and these tragedies which are happening, as in Romania, are not the problem of the legislative, but of the executive and of the governments.	1.6246449334252326
Furthermore, it is not a fair directive because it ignores the large uninhabited areas, climatic diversity, desert areas and arid areas.	1.1209195458789227
That is how the common position has been worded.	1.071005910099951
The same can be said with regard to transfers.	0.7884986189892327
Transfers are an example of the distribution of wealth, of solidarity between peoples and territories, because unfortunately the Earth is not perfect and some areas have more and some have less.	1.281983835859974
Lastly, I am highly critical of the fact that the directive is not accompanied by a study of its impact.	1.4163666205726875
It is very easy for us to demand that others assess its impact but, on environmental questions, we should demand it of ourselves and consider how many people, how many farmers, could be ruined by having to pay the costs.	1.4715079112488436
Some kind of study has been done which has not even been read, and I believe we should carry out impact studies by way of good political practice, rather than just laying down doctrine.	1.2731769208193062
Mr President, through the consolidation of existing directives this framework directive establishes the basic principle of a sustainable water policy in the European Union.	1.3002376836224245
It is a framework for the protection and management of our water - surface, ground, transitional and coastal - through the establishment of river basin districts at national and, in our case in Ireland, cross-border level.	1.43264691338998
Ireland is very supportive of the common position and many of the European Parliament amendments.	1.489314171447306
A 25-year roll-out for legislation, for example, is hardly acceptable.	1.1571966083573417
We have no difficulty with the "polluter pays" principle in relation to the recovery of costs on water usage at industrial, commercial and agricultural level.	1.0913794949451117
However, I feel very strongly that as water is life and access to clean drinking water is a basic human right, this directive must allow for a basic domestic water provision free of charge, a quota per household for drinking, cooking and sanitation.	1.2732827855592772
We must of course pay for wastage and luxury use at domestic level and the recovery of costs can be balanced accordingly.	0.8682728019122392
The introduction of water meters is viewed with great suspicion in Ireland where we have had no domestic water charges and hence no meters since 1977.	1.078943031027102
Meters could be viewed as a very important tool in water management by the new river basin districts, to help the elimination of water wastage and for the proper planning of future requirements.	1.297001374782529
The whole purpose of this directive is to promote sustainable use of water in the EU.	1.1812625808998742
Water is a scarce and precious natural resource.	0.7910981527028338
Ideally, I would like Amendment No 45 to fall tomorrow so that the common position on Article 9 would hold on water charges.	1.3635968172411213
That would allow for subsidiarity on a cost policy for water charges, with each Member States drawing up its own scheme, so long as the principles of this directive on incentives for sustainable and efficient use of water are fully protected.	1.4053645029782036
If Amendment No 45 does not fall, I will have to move an oral amendment tomorrow to ensure that Member States may grant exemptions to the provisions of this article in order to allow a basic level of water use for domestic purposes before contributions to the recovery of cost of water services.	1.2625194406067037
All legislation must be enforceable and be based on the general principle of political acceptance.	1.0083651753175225
I believe that access to clean drinking water without charge is a basic human right in the developed as well as the developing world.	1.1707598438667346
Mr President, Commissioner, at this point in the debate I am going to insist on certain aspects which, from an agronomic point of view, and since I come from a southern country, I consider to be absolutely essential to this directive.	1.529284011518082
These include, for example, costs and transfers.	0.8531088767268272
With regard to costs, I would like clarification of what costs we are talking about.	1.14501485963728
Are we talking about the distribution and sourcing of water?	0.6714558475866444
Are we talking about the quality of the distribution networks?	0.9697336730894477
Are we talking about the nature of the works required to provide water services?	0.8301830140254531
Or are we talking about large-scale hydraulic works and reservoirs?	0.8192815491255995
All these costs added together would be horrendous and would have repercussions for the agricultural sector.	0.9001675468895443
Transfers are defined as the transfer of surface water between different territorial areas.	0.7559993113629746
Is the Commissioner aware that our country has one of the oldest systems of transfers in Europe?	0.9469195918319162
They already existed in ancient times: they had them in Roman times, although on a smaller scale.	1.0901752939244562
One of the most significant transfers - the Tajo-Segura transfer - which has been in use for many years, almost 30 years, has an allowance of 658 hm3 per year.	1.3876829349001112
The largest volume transferred in one year has been 453 and the average volume over twenty years has been over 200.	0.8894849553816101
We cannot be accused of bad management.	0.7941592976419533
Is the Commissioner aware that, of this 263 hm3, we used 25 for irrigation on the left bank of the Levante, 30 for water supplies in the area of the Júcar, 7 for supplies in the southern area of the Júcar and the rest in the Segura, equally divided between supplies and irrigation?	1.2926874445135534
We are not doing a bad job of management.	1.2067195547228753
We cannot be prohibited from carrying out transfers when our economy and the development of our regions depend on it.	1.0800450310889507
I will not tackle the issue of quality and the best available technologies, because I believe that we will return to a discussion of this directive.	1.39254525168515
Take good note: in this diverse Europe, which we are building in a spirit of mutual cooperation, we have to find diverse solutions, not single solutions.	1.546346890183722
I therefore appeal to the common sense of the Commission, the Council and this House so that, when voting, they do not impose uniformity on the different countries of Europe in areas where subsidiarity is required.	1.5382346518543522
Commissioner, Andalusia is not Lapland.	1.0396564074786279
. (SV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want, of course, to begin by thanking the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and, above all, the rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann for the ambitious and constructive work she has put into the present framework water directive.	1.1182391489597054
Water is one of our most important natural resources, as many speakers have already said.	1.2296180768039413
An ambitious and well-balanced European policy in the field of water is an important component of guaranteed sustainable development for Europe.	1.2196423751344312
Water is also one of the issues to which I shall be devoting particular attention during my term of office.	1.2839339285999571
I am pleased about the spirit of agreement which permeates the amendments that have been submitted to Parliament.	0.8603135688927965
Many of them are based upon the very constructive, informal discussions which have taken place between Parliament and the Council in connection with the first reading.	1.4538436892630127
Most of Parliament' s proposed amendments help improve the text and make it more ambitious.	1.035148327271751
The Commission can approve 72 of the 108 amendments, either in their entirety, partially or in principle.	0.8554367740430593
Many of the amendments which Parliament has submitted show that reconciliation will be necessary.	1.1707171376647982
With a view to these forthcoming negotiations, I would therefore urge Parliament to vote in favour of an ambitious position.	1.4056906644693894
Firstly, I should like to mention some of my most important arguments.	1.454179275235386
We now have the opportunity to put into practice those measures to which we agreed under the OSPAR Convention.	1.0896625405995015
Rather than make these objectives legally binding, we must consider their political nature.	1.1742260348944193
This is also reflected in many of Parliament' s amendments.	1.2168489004446066
Where water charges are concerned, the present directive will constitute Europe' s water policy for the next three decades.	1.148139046580761
It is our duty to ensure from the very start that the present directive provides the right incentives and the proper driving force for a pricing system and an efficient structure of charges which will improve our environment in a cost-effective way.	1.2004877384553432
It sounds good, saying that access to water should be a human right and ought to be free of charge.	0.9863649112582427
But water is not free of charge, any more than houses or food are free of charge.	1.0564828727709714
It is only by means of efficient instruments of control that we can arrive at a situation in which water is better managed and more carefully husbanded as a resource.	1.205377649210364
I also want to add that, when it comes to groundwater and to water which has been heavily modified by human activities, I support a tighter timetable and a clarification of goals and of criteria for allowing exceptions to the rules. I also support expressly mentioning radioactive substances.	1.3388547086229812
In the course of the debate, many speakers have pointed out how important it is to consult the general public and keep them informed.	1.2520388749832874
I just want to emphasise this further.	1.170046183452427
It is absolutely crucial that we involve the general public by keeping them well informed and by proceeding to consult them.	0.9740656284676169
This is also expressed in Recital 14.	1.105007581580171
Allow me also to say to Mr Bowe that, in common with my Scottish colleague, he need have no pangs of conscience about continuing to enjoy a glass of Scotch whisky now and again.	1.2332780498013558
We have not considered it necessary for the Commission to regulate the very limited abstraction of water for whisky production.	1.3388281309694225
Allow me now to comment on some of the areas in a little more detail.	1.1132902228196921
Limiting discharges of hazardous substances into our waters must be one of the most important objectives.	0.9054393264516308
I am glad to see that Parliament' s amendments have focused upon this.	0.9972169998807405
The Commission fully supports the proposal to introduce the commitments under the OSPAR Convention into the text.	1.0769962872914915
We must, however, keep to their precise scope and content.	1.0970032626100599
As I said, their purpose and the timetable for implementing them are political in character.	1.0599030641726284
It would not be in keeping with this to introduce a legally binding timetable.	1.0457918427224593
It must nonetheless be guaranteed that the Member States and the Community are compelled to take measures to achieve the relevant goals and comply with the timetables.	1.114076693275463
I therefore welcome Amendments Nos 6, 10, 14, 24, 58, 60 and 88 .	0.8557084452292112
The Commission cannot, on the other hand, approve Amendment No 19, in which hazardous substances are defined differently than in OSPAR.	1.2391541385050484
The Commission' s proposal introduces a clear procedure for selecting substances, and so no definition is needed.	1.2644053219468967
Even if I too agree with the contents of Amendments Nos 79 and 106, these go beyond the commitments under OSPAR, and I cannot therefore approve these Amendments.	1.3930023403196015
The Commission can also, in principle, approve Amendment No 60, according to which a timetable is required for implementing the Commission' s proposal to limit discharges of prioritised substances.	1.206471058861199
Amendment No 59 introduces requirements to the effect that the list of prioritised substances should continually be reviewed.	0.869616075610879
This would involve legal uncertainty as to the status of the list and cannot, therefore, be approved.	1.0226162051404577
The desire expressed in Amendments Nos 60 and 93 for a list of goals and a list of substances for which no adequate data is available cannot be approved.	0.9248671429228226
Lists of this kind would not have clear legal status and do not fit in with the procedures for adopting the list of prioritised substances.	1.0971453425456816
I would point out in this regard that the OSPAR Convention does not in any way alter existing Community legislation concerning nitrates from the agricultural sector.	1.1430860103897975
The Nitrates Directive will not therefore be influenced by the present framework directive.	1.099393051480933
I appreciate the fact that Parliament has proved to be flexible over the very sensitive and difficult question of imposing charges for water services.	1.1412408275476225
I can wholeheartedly support the demand that the price of water should be set at a level which creates incentives to use water resources in a sustainable way.	1.1266203322247328
I also support the demand for a suitable contribution from each sector to cover own costs.	1.064625044767333
I can therefore partly, and in principle, approve Amendments Nos 43-46, together with Amendment No 85.	1.2929413559021634
I believe that we need legally binding requirements stating that the financial costs of water services are to be covered by each economic sector.	1.2926551885382223
This would constitute a clear goal against which progress could be measured.	0.714602364855253
I therefore support the overall thrust of Amendment No 105, which is in line with the Commission' s original proposal.	1.2728032087263121
I also support a gradual development in the direction of covering environmental costs and the costs of resources.	0.9811409142550915
We are aware of the fact that the price of water and water services is a complicated issue and that account must be taken not only of environmental goals but also of social and economic goals.	1.389566096264105
This must not, however, be an excuse for subsidising inefficient economic sectors which cause pollution.	1.121773482646355
We intend shortly to issue a communication from the Commission on precisely this question.	1.1155425425453962
I agree with Parliament that the common position' s sixteen-year timeframe for implementing these measures must be considerably reduced.	1.0799812411566627
The same also applies to the possibility which exists of extending the period of implementation by a further eighteen years.	0.9845819688963834
Amendment No 28, cancelling the third extension period, is an important step in the right direction.	1.0633197256693772
This proposal can therefore be approved.	0.5417487704179466
A period of ten years, as proposed in Amendments Nos 24 and 26, among others, is, on the other hand, too short.	1.3169662550209926
I believe that consideration ought to be given to wording the overall definition of the requirements under the proposal in such a way that it includes a strict and explicit condition to the effect that causing deterioration of the environment must be avoided.	1.2808560245384666
The proposal must also include more stringent criteria for establishing lesser environmental objectives and for extending deadlines in connection with heavily modified or artificial bodies of water.	0.9492412999204739
This applies to Amendments Nos 6, 24, 25, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 78, 80, 102 and 104.	0.680685041190741
These Amendments may in large part be approved and will be supported until such time as an overall solution can be found.	1.0708032981672502
To comply with the demands in Amendments Nos 27 and 29, to the effect that the Commission should approve every extension, would be going too far, and these cannot be approved.	1.4258097257734055
Another important area is protection of the groundwater.	0.9677521849089926
We need both a starting point and a final goal if we are to reverse the upward trend in pollution.	1.0708841937288636
We also need stricter criteria for interpreting the results of any monitoring.	1.0931106664954213
The most important parts of Parliament' s Amendments Nos 25 and 73 can therefore be approved in principle.	1.0338772645485261
The new definition in Amendment No 72 is, however, too strict and cannot be applied for this purpose.	1.301051568378146
I would propose that Amendment No 92 should be incorporated into a broader solution.	0.8483331514523014
Amendment No 71 does not take account of seasonal variations and annual changes in the level of the groundwater.	0.8698312900135023
The proposal cannot therefore be approved.	0.48837598795030235
The Commission considers it unrealistic and unnecessary to lay down standards guaranteeing that the least intensive water purification is adequate to ensure that surface water is of drinking water quality.	1.0134342091314108
Instead, we prefer an addition to those measures which are required in accordance with Article 11 to promote activities in this area.	1.3408408507479714
The good status which is required under this proposal ought to guarantee that the demand for surface water of good quality is fulfilled.	1.005226497338829
This part of Amendment No 41 cannot, therefore, be approved.	0.9033923420083348
The Commission appreciates Parliament' s efforts to guarantee that the so-called combined approach is given a central role.	1.1180186747309293
This approach and its scope, which the Commission can in principle approve, are defined by Amendments Nos 22 and 47.	1.4364271648835207
In order to achieve the greatest possible legal clarity and proportionality, we wish, however, to reformulate Amendment No 47 and to add a de minimis provision.	1.4032533582512292
The transfer of water is already covered by controls, but explicitly mentioning it makes the text clearer.	1.1903781969940117
These parts of Amendments Nos 49 and 87 can, therefore, be approved.	0.744257806664875
It is nonetheless unnecessary to make it a condition that all the measures for controlling demand should be adopted.	1.1588847665372508
The proposal already specifies that water must be abstracted in accordance with the ecological needs in the river basin district concerned.	0.995064583845874
These parts of Amendments Nos 49 and 87 cannot, therefore, be approved.	0.7183033655815952
The Commission approves Amendment No 76 to the effect that radioactive substances are explicitly to be included in the proposal.	0.8906102434117087
To summarise, the Commission is able to approve 72 amendments, either in their entirety, partially or in principle.	0.9520939947172219
The following amendments cannot be approved: 1, 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19, 23, 39, 40, 51, 59, 61, 64, 66, 70, 71, 71, 72, 74, 77, 79, 81, 83, 87, 89, 90, 91, 95, 97, 98, 100, 101, 103, 106 and 107.	0.6706322963359534
Finally, I want to say that I welcome the efforts which Parliament has made to try to solve the questions on which the Council takes other views.	1.4462164143757943
Important progress has been made, and the constructive tone of the discussions creates a good working climate for future discussions.	1.2125656455090381
A number of obstacles remain, but I am convinced that, as the legislative work progresses, we shall achieve our common goal of creating a water policy we can be proud of.	1.4696246231125627
Parliament' s adopting a clear position will be an important contribution to an ambitious, European water policy for the next three decades.	1.1900188259107878
I would like to hear the Commissioner's view on Amendment No 45.	1.2288429546185318
I may have missed it in the list she gave out.	1.008070858500655
. I accept that.	1.1285909128681828
Thank you, Mrs Wallström.	0.9168360875475176
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 p.m.	0.4486518941132708
Financial instrument for the environment (LIFE)	0.6090345256997165
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0014/2000), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Regulation on a financial instrument for the environment (LIFE) (Rapporteur: Mrs Lienemann).	0.9576024570721404
rapporteur.	-0.0
(FR) Mr President, we have already had the opportunity, at the first reading, to examine this report and I was given to believe in committee that there was a broad consensus within this House.	1.4599679495676219
LIFE is the only budget line for direct assistance for the environment in the Community budget, and one cannot help but note that it does not live up to our ambitions since the amounts allocated to it have been stagnating for years. Despite the enlargement which has already taken place, when we renewed the first LIFE programme to move on to the second, despite enlargement, the level of appropriations remained the same.	1.4360856214778754
And then we see that, increasingly, the regions, the various operators, businesses, associations, are submitting LIFE projects, both for LIFE-NATURE and LIFE-ENVIRONMENT, projects that are of excellent quality, which following technical assessment by all the competent committees are unanimously found to be worthy of European Union support, but we still cannot fund them, for lack of budget appropriations.	1.4717441601206656
It must also be mentioned that this budget experiences a rate of consumption of appropriations which is quite exceptional within the Community budget.	1.0532067900981037
Patently we have here an instrument that is appropriate for the policies which we wish to implement.	1.0303574993523876
I would stress the LIFE-NATURE strand in particular.	0.9379885988604392
We are well aware that, in the European Union, a whole raft of directives such as the directive on habitats and the directive on migratory birds encounter problems in implementation. With LIFE-NATURE we should be able to support policies which demonstrate the feasibility, the validity of the objectives of these directives, and their capacity to be implemented.	1.4726436340550015
And, for want of appropriations, we lose this legitimacy and allow the idea that these European directives of ours are not reasonable and are not applicable to develop.	1.3391799531703832
And so the debates taking place today focus on two major issues: firstly, comitology, an ongoing debate within this House, but Parliament wished to implement policies settled rather by management committees or advisory committees which give the Commission some flexibility and which do not give the Council too much scope to obstruct and have their intergovernmental philosophy prevail over the Community philosophy which we are here to stand up for within the European Parliament.	1.291759523165751
But we have these comitology debates with regard to most of the European Union' s financial programmes and instruments.	1.2647202726071445
I would say that in my opinion - and the experiences we have had in the past tend to show this - that reconciling opinions on comitology is rather easier than reconciling opinions on the budget.	1.4326513309794249
Let me point out that Parliament is asking for 850 million ecus in appropriations, not a vast sum in the Community budget, and that the current proposals are for 613 million ecus.	1.3432748838729767
I feel, at any rate, that for the ultimate application of LIFE, at least, there would be some way for the Union to make a significant budgetary gesture in favour of the environment.	1.5390558421676235
Let me conclude with the matter of our institutions' way of working.	1.0911958574310856
This is the essence of how I understand the situation: we are being told that it is essential for us to reach a conclusion quickly, that, basically, the Members of Parliament should drop their claims, particularly claims on the budget, for if we do not soon, in line with the codecision procedure, get around to establishing the framework of the regulations for LIFE, then its implementation for the year 2000 is going to suffer a delay, and in the meantime the NGOs and the operators at grass roots level are waiting for our appropriations.	1.4773679099124433
I would, however, like to point out that the Council has plenty of time to formulate its ideas and that it is submitting its proposals to us only a few months before the fateful date.	1.3190811991039564
As for us, we our bound by the terms of the texts: a maximum of four months.	1.3493740042696265
We meet our deadlines and afterwards we are told that we should hold on and that in order to be reasonable we must go along with the position of the others, because in the codecision procedure there is just not enough time.	1.3388121214404523
I think Parliament often protests about this method, not to point the finger at any specific party within the Council, and I certainly would not want the Portuguese Presidency to feel responsible for this state of affairs, since, the truth is, it is something of a tradition, which the Council has kept going for a long time.	1.5601292856761657
But I should like to stress the fact that, on this issue of the environment, the budget issue is a central one and Parliament cannot yield to the blackmail which requires it to be the only reasonable party in the deal.	1.525511183046028
I therefore hope, firstly, that our fellow Members will support us in the conciliation - but votes on this area are always very much in agreement - but also that the Council and the Commission will manage to listen to us and that we shall each take a step towards the other.	1.5882791280711002
Mr President, it is true that we are in open disagreement on some of the choices made by the Council and the Commission, and I will refer to this later on.	1.4511544634604967
It is equally true, however, that we should begin by saying that this regulation is better than those covering LIFE I and LIFE II.	1.3072864619451678
It is better firstly because the framework proposal made LIFE I more rigorous, more transparent and more rational.	1.156245855661965
Secondly, it is better because the common position includes some fundamental recommendations, which were advocated by the European Parliament at first reading. Specifically, these are: to promote employment as a factor to be taken into consideration when selecting candidate projects, and to reduce the environmental impact of products at every stage from production to recycling and elimination.	1.5505753997937786
This is one of the aims that LIFE-Environment must achieve. Thirdly, the fact that the common position has for the first time introduced upgrading and planning for coastal areas as one of LIFE-Environment' s priorities is an extremely positive step.	1.3937099692676203
In spite of all its virtues though, LIFE III' s regulation fails in what is obviously the most important aspect of determining a financial instrument' s impact, which is its budget.	1.365776739982057
By persisting with their proposal of EUR 613 million as a reference amount for 2000 - 2004, and by refusing to accept the European Parliament' s proposal of EUR 850 million, the Commission and the Council are taking a decision which we do not feel is based on the same criteria of rationality and justice that they introduced, and rightly so, for other measures in LIFE III.	1.397724570125873
We want the Commission and the Council to know that we will not give up trying to provide LIFE with the budget it deserves and which best guarantees the environmental results that we are seeking to achieve with this kind of instrument.	1.4461092879333728
We have four very straightforward arguments which we feel justify our choice.	0.8208179895042472
Firstly, LIFE is the only direct financial instrument which is designed to promote environmental policy within the European Union.	1.0883403584349038
There is no other such policy.	1.1239439569777292
Secondly, LIFE is an instrument that has already produced good results, and has enabled innovative methods and techniques to be developed and has an excellent rate of implementation.	1.477776127570848
Thirdly, the LIFE budget has been reduced in real terms has not kept up with the enormous dynamism and creativity of demand.	1.1226914855754557
Fourthly, as Parliament ascribes so much value to LIFE, it has allocated ever-greater appropriations to this project in its annual budget.	1.3612271564135836
This means that approving the proposal put forward by the Council and by the Commission would represent an unacceptable reversal of this trend.	1.4863731067045094
Our concern does not centre purely on the budgetary issue, however.	1.049578873487949
Climate change and water policy are subjects that are of great concern to the European public and which have deserved considerable attention from this House.	1.2062939593935764
We therefore feel it is crucial that as Amendments Nos 5 and 6 seek to establish as objectives which LIFE-Environment should achieve a plan for the sustainable management of ground water and surface water, as well as for reducing greenhouse gases, they should be adopted.	1.1456844477665564
Lastly, I would like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on her report and to take the opportunity to say to her that we will be voting in favour of her amendments on comitology even though, as was made clear in the Committee on the Environment, we would prefer LIFE to have been monitored by an advisory committee, we do want to contribute to allowing the solution proposed by the Council to be accepted as quite frankly, it was worse.	1.4944474620721946
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, LIFE is the European Union' s most important instrument and indeed its only financial instrument dedicated exclusively to the environment.	1.1911868077088974
That explains why this instrument must live up to our ambitions, ambitions for which, of course, there is a price.	1.0774932178729133
Obviously, the basic item for discussion with the Council will be the allocation for LIFE III.	1.5282305427752845
The common position stipulates a total appropriation of EUR 613 million for the period 2000-2004. This is not enough.	1.2772458524458696
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is in favour of increasing this amount to EUR 850 million.	0.8066645567954162
We therefore support Mrs Lienemann' s amendment which observes that the allocation for LIFE was not increased when the Union was last enlarged, without even mentioning the next batch of new arrivals.	1.1137799761626783
The amount that we are asking for is no great mountain of useless expenditure.	1.018971466823542
Quite the opposite, it is still fairly modest in relation to the requirements to be funded.	1.4236528170413218
A drop in the ocean, I might say, in comparison with Europe' s structural policies.	1.3635923994008654
The environment is still the poor relation in the European budget, even though it is primarily an investment.	1.546455990158888
An investment in natural resources, of course, but also in employment, since it has been demonstrated that an active environmental policy generated new jobs, as shown particularly by the great success of LIFE, a success with NGOs, businesses, local authorities and third countries.	1.326792898283635
More than one third of the 8,500 requests received meet the required conditions and it has been possible to cofinance approximately 1,300 projects between 1992 and 1998.	0.9531349736022723
A success which Parliament wishes and intends to see perpetuated, and this is why we also support amendment 14 outlining the fourth phase of the LIFE project.	1.1891648612305508
In matters of the environment, investment and ambition come in a variety of forms, and indeed must come in a variety of forms in the long term.	1.0651073369733133
This is the price of the future of generations to come.	1.4948079245799637
Mr President, Commissioner, I am probably going to repeat things my fellow Members have said but I believe that, as far as the Council is concerned, the thing is to repeat over and over what we think of LIFE.	1.4707926679842263
I shall therefore reiterate that, as the rapporteur has already said quite clearly, LIFE is the only specific financial instrument for the implementation of the European Union' s policy on the environment.	1.3964319687236875
This instrument is absolutely essential since it provides the impetus for truly innovative actions in favour of nature and the environment in Europe, which are adopted and expanded upon by the Member States.	1.2757501410131802
This financial instrument is, furthermore, deliberately democratic since it is accessible to both governmental and non-governmental organisations.	1.0235610868467755
That is why, ladies and gentlemen, I would urge you not to vote in favour of the amendments which have no appreciation of the spirit of LIFE.	1.1617410573386564
Through the associations, then, LIFE is a facility that can be used by the European citizen directly, and for the benefit of actions in the interest of the community.	1.3711161139367318
Several million NGO members - millions, I say - recognise in LIFE the Union' s determination to build up an ambitious policy in favour of our natural heritage.	1.28369961875305
LIFE is, moreover, the fundamental instrument of the Natura 2000 network in Europe into which the Member States have put a lot, pursuant to Community directives on the habitats of rare and endangered fauna and flora and on migratory birds, and which makes it possible to set up the protection of sites of high biological value in our States.	1.249428019151118
I should like to say that those who run down this policy in their own States bear the responsibility for obstructing European nature conservation policies.	1.1885216774401544
This is a pity because everyone within this Chamber knows that LIFE is a financial instrument which is not sufficient to carry out the projects submitted by Member States, a good many of which are turned down due to lack of funds.	1.2965149640577598
Let us not forget that, to date, LIFE amounts to only EUR 100 million per annum, i.e. scarcely 0.1% of the budget of the European Union.	1.154395001022039
For the record, the budget for agriculture, which has a real impact on the environment, amounts, as we all know, to EUR 37 billion.	1.4864497739374984
Against this background, my group thinks it essential to increase the allocation to LIFE and unreservedly supports Mrs Lienemann' s proposal to increase the budget to EUR 850 million, since we know, and I think it bears saying, how high the expectations of our fellow citizens on environmental matters are and how excessively cautious and unacceptable the Council' s compromise regarding the budget for LIFE is, especially as the LIFE programmes show exceptional implementation rates and have demonstrated the extent to which they made it possible to bring about new environmental practice.	1.326314671892661
The first sustainable development projects are unquestionably those.	0.7672283635107903
Mr President, the European Union environmental programme, to which a considerable amount (EUR 613 million) has been allocated, gives rise to many questions regarding the proper use of public funds.	1.4240767164668533
A financial instrument of this order ought to be transparent and effective, and this is not the case for the following reasons: poorly defined selection criteria, dubious uncoordinated operations, assessments not made public and the lack of any assessment policy.	1.0970858436067652
We are therefore proposing to amend the regulations as follows.	1.1594270304929928
Firstly, to reserve the acquisitions made thanks to LIFE funds exclusively to public bodies, subsequently, following invitation to tender, to entrust the management of these sites to authorised nature conservation associations.	1.262433654700576
It is a question of the continuity of the ownership of the acquisitions, since private law associations may disappear or resell acquisitions.	1.163512218260218
It is shocking in philosophical terms and dubious in legal terms for 100% public money to be used to build up a heritage of private land ownership, even under cover of environmental protection.	1.1040937347772626
Secondly, to define the criteria for the eligibility and allocation of LIFE funds, in order to rule our any suspicions of clientelism or ostracism.	1.218141842807493
Thirdly, to make prior coordination with the users and communities concerned a prerequisite.	1.3028917921819503
For example, the LIFE-Nature project in France, at Grand-Lieu Lake, planned without any coordination, led to a real ecological disaster, the de-silting operation which was carried out without regard for French law on the subject caused significant silting of the Acheneau, a water course located downstream, destroying spawning beds, filling wetlands, and who knows what else.	1.2202393014687896
The silt was in fact shifted 3 kilometres, at a cost of FF 6 million, the cure being worse than the disease, and a consequence that was foreseeable and actually predicted by the parties involved with the site.	1.3133689998789997
Result: a court action and repair costs greater than the cost of the programme itself.	1.2078147273906958
This is the sort of thing that we want to avoid.	1.0854856760052607
Four, to include representatives of Parliament in the monitoring committee, at least one Member per political group.	1.459156112403585
What could be fairer than for Members of Parliament to monitor the use of the appropriations they voted for?	1.1438648264221585
Fifthly, to publish an annual scientific, technical and financial assessment of LIFE operations carried out.	1.2308284222398824
Six, to carry out proper evaluation of the programmes on a regular basis.	1.2102295985569476
Seven, to make it possible for these funds to be used in the event of an environmental emergency: for example, in reforestation following storm damage, or restoration of the natural environment following an oil slick, etc.	1.351125768154068
Here, Mrs Lienemann, Mr President, we are putting forward here a practical proposal, a common sense proposal, easy to implement, likely to limit local conflicts and to vindicate the proper use of public monies, before increasing the LIFE budget line by as much as 40%!	1.2768959770022104
Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on the report she has carried out, and also the Commission - why not? - because this report, this position, generally improves on the texts in force.	1.2563820790424918
Furthermore, it contains more acceptable systematics and is clearer and more transparent.	1.1400127263558857
I would also like to congratulate the services of the Commission, since the evaluation, control and monitoring of the LIFE programme provide a reasonable guarantee with regard to the selection and execution of projects.	1.2407918320396971
However, I would like to insist on certain points.	1.032854583689669
Firstly, its continuity, which, in principle, I am not questioning.	1.6852991403692086
Secondly, the financial contributions.	1.5006853159394384
Sadly, only 7.2% of the projects requested receive funds.	1.4298157352866427
Of the EUR 1 919 million requested, only EUR 784 million have been granted.	1.054381580458913
Now the financial statement shows only EUR 613 million to cover more countries and competences.	0.8733742194930944
Parliament has proposed EUR 850 million, but the document repeats the initial proposal of EUR 613 million.	1.096808409192988
Commissioner, our environmental commitments are increasing in all areas, while the only financial instrument exclusively dedicated to the environment is decreasing.	1.4702010800735246
Is this not a contradiction?	0.9470431864922032
Let us not demand from others what we are not prepared to give ourselves?	1.2779922231123735
Why do we all go on about the environment and are then not prepared to pay for it amongst all of us, but rather expect the usual people, the ones who live there all year, to pay for it and maintain it?	1.4284787938516068
Commissioner, we must be consistent.	1.5587706335046447
The cost of maintaining the environment, which we all enjoy, must be met by all of us, and the LIFE programme is the only financial instrument aimed exclusively at the environment and whose projects have generally been effective.	1.459215155611451
Mr President, LIFE has been the principal instrument available to the Community since 1992 for supporting and developing environmental policy, both within the Community and in the surrounding third countries.	1.5261911946119022
On the basis of the experience gained over the past eight years, an attempt is being made to increase the effectiveness of action on behalf of the environment in the third development phase of that financial instrument.	1.3518871889663497
The funding of activities for the implementation, adaptation and development of Community policy in the environment sector and the incorporation of the environment in other policies, particularly ones that contribute towards sustainable development, are central elements of the regulation we are to vote upon.	1.3644514266692294
An important element of LIFE-Nature, which mainly concerns the realisation of the Natura 2000 network, is the introduction of a multinational approach to formulating plans for international projects and activities, so as to avoid the fragmentation of biotopes and to offer better protection of biodiversity.	1.183885796506263
In the second, LIFE-Environment strand, which is more concerned with projects involving small and medium-sized enterprises and local government agencies, the incorporation of the environment in other policies is expressed very clearly indeed.	1.3174647269945696
As regards the financing package for the implementation of LIFE over the next five years, I wholeheartedly support the increase from EUR 613 million to EUR 850 million proposed by the rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann.	1.2441620797924697
Unless the necessary means are secured to pursue environmental protection, there is no point on the one hand in continuing to raise the environmental awareness achieved in recent years, and on the other hand in incorporating the environmental dimension in other policies.	1.3240417108250013
Besides, we cannot remain indifferent towards the increased challenges in areas around the Union or towards addressing very acute environmental protection problems in the applicant countries.	1.145089947303338
What has happened over the past few days with the pollution of the Danube and its tributary has been instructive.	1.07748161283008
Consequently, I consider that support for environmental action under the LIFE financial instrument will help to further Community policy in the environmental sector and can contribute substantially to fulfilling the Community' s mission of achieving a high level of environmental protection and improvement.	1.2354757726346093
Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Lienemann on her sensitive approach towards the environment, ably demonstrated in the two reports we have discussed this evening.	1.131450182447695
Two minutes is certainly not long enough to deal with such an important topic.	0.991833114757471
So I will simply appeal to the Commissioner to undertake full responsibility for such an important issue.	1.3489848649888094
For five years, I have been the representative of the Committee on the Environment in a regional organisation, which assuredly does not have Parliament' s broad perspective.	1.6023323340910884
The environment is in a parlous state.	1.1638737514118997
Like a number of previous speakers, I, too, wish to consider the economic problem and the problem of finding funding for projects, which, in my view, should be incorporated into the pubic domain.	1.190085154922987
As regards funding, EUR 613 million is not enough. Even EUR 850 million is not enough.	0.9587275107714793
At the end of August 1999, I took part in a meeting of the Committee of the Environment in which it was said that EUR 2 million, or ITL 4 000 billion, should go towards eliminating or, at any rate, reducing smoking.	1.424348804485872
However, the environment constitutes a far bigger and more serious problem than smoking.	1.245984078109292
EUR 850 million - assuming that such a figure is actually agreed - believe me, is not enough, in practical terms, to allow any type of project to be carried out.	1.3836869186391185
In many areas the parks which are a fundamental element in the LIFE programme have been established.	1.1689434593907504
But creating parks with very limited financial resources, without any system of signs is inefficient and ineffectual.	1.0471453679311182
I would therefore ask Parliament and the Commission to give the matter their full attention.	1.3183585662644086
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ever since the beginning of 1999, discussions have taken place between the institutions on the subject of the proposed regulation for a third stage for the instrument for the environment known as LIFE.	1.299458657307739
I would again thank the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and Mrs Lienemann for the good and constructive co-operation we have had on this matter.	1.0460087457992127
As a result of this, I can confirm that the Commission wholly or in principle approves nine of the fourteen amendments which have been adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.	1.0558304080228484
The Commission welcomes, above all, Amendments Nos 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13, which apply to the Committee procedures.	0.9933821690055828
In these cases, Parliament has fully taken account of the objections which the Commission had to the common position.	1.2631343914323312
The Commission can, in principle, also approve Amendment No 4 which ought, however, to be introduced into another place in the text.	1.504572568720782
With regard to Amendments Nos 5 and 6, I want to emphasise that projects for the sustainable exploitation of groundwater and surface water, together with projects for reducing forms of air pollution which contribute to the greenhouse effect, are to a large degree covered by LIFE.	1.1631071873113503
The Commission nonetheless considers that, if this is stated separately, then that is to go against the original decision to have the proposal focus on just a few priority areas.	1.4241617998054223
There is also a risk of overlap with other Community programmes such as the Fifth Framework Programme for Research, Technical Development and Demonstration.	1.1454320750614737
The present programme' s key measures - water quality, tomorrow' s city and innovative products and processes - to a certain degree cover the same questions.	1.1744874891750352
Where the question of the budget is concerned, I am pleased about the confidence shown by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.	1.038474203366051
Amendment No 12 requires a larger budget than that stated in the common position.	0.9029585644420338
I am also convinced that LIFE has great potential.	1.023785336964118
This instrument could finance good projects with a higher amount of money than that quoted in the proposed budget.	0.922248935989573
The amount quoted in Amendment No 12 does not, however, tally with the budget set on the basis of Agenda 2000.	1.1457387813799964
Allow me also to add that, if the budget is increased, greater demands are obviously going to be made upon the Directorate-General for the Environment if an increased number of projects are going to be dealt with.	1.3900142333081205
Account will also have to be taken of other programmes where decisions are to be made within the framework of the joint decision-making procedure.	1.2871444741950082
At this stage, the Commission is keeping to the amount which has been set in the common position.	1.1970289565108212
With regard to Amendment No 3, which we did not approve at first reading, I want to emphasise that each programme has its own objectives, conditions under which it may be applied for and costs which make it eligible for aid.	1.2846344599559711
It is therefore meaningless, and often impossible, directly to transfer projects from LIFE to other instruments.	1.3700924735341828
If other sources of finance were to be investigated for each project, more resources would, moreover, be required than are available in the present situation.	1.325468922214368
Now that the Commission has to consider carefully what resources are required for each activity, this is an example of the kind of activity we ought to avoid: one that is inessential but demanding in terms of resources.	1.2970811090292476
Nor can the Commission approve Amendment No 14, which is contrary to the Commission' s right of initiative.	1.3127197255336318
With regard to the discussion concerning the deadline, I want to say that the final date for beginning to implement LIFE - 31 March 2000, as set in the common position - must now be moved forward.	1.3607399880572413
The date will be fixed as soon as the present regulation has been adopted.	1.0955813188063164
Finally, I want to repeat that I am convinced that LIFE will be an effective instrument in support of development and the implementation of the Community' s environmental policy.	1.3540858438498466
Parliament has contributed greatly to improving this instrument.	0.7068075624965496
I am convinced that you share my wish that it should be possible to adopt the regulation as soon as possible, especially in view of the fact that there are great expectations in the Member States and in other countries, especially among the applicant States which are now being given the opportunity to participate in LIFE.	1.2751940236393426
Thank you, Mrs Wallström.	0.9168360875475176
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	0.28917441844220476
Modernising social protection	-0.0
The next item is the report (A5-0033/2000), by Mr Andersson on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission on a concerted strategy for modernising social protection [COM(1999) 347 - C5-0253/1999 - 1999/2182(COS)].	0.9133046290970745
Mr President, the issue of social security systems is an important one.	1.2353318014549755
This is a natural consequence of cooperation within the EU.	1.2329009618992952
The basis is monetary cooperation, which has since been followed up by macro-economic cooperation and cooperation on employment policy.	1.2467615327732489
It is now a natural consequence to move on to social security systems.	1.1182464974772972
These areas are mutually dependent upon one another.	0.6839231529513701
Economic stability is a reason for growth and can provide high employment.	0.9100033001797745
It also provides the opportunity to develop welfare provision.	0.9639705342123379
But the reverse is also the case: a well-developed policy on social security can contribute to high employment and to increased growth.	1.1773642678673695
In other words, social security is a factor of production.	1.2026879958066852
Social security systems differ from one EU country to another.	0.7881141740536208
This is largely due to historical factors.	0.5972951019643755
We are now faced with a number of common challenges, however; demographic development, for example, which has to do not only with the increase in the number of elderly people but also with the lower birth rate.	1.3578831292324716
The labour market is also changing.	0.7790587053057001
Women are venturing into the labour market in ever greater numbers.	0.7902855266339684
Another challenge is presented by technical development.	0.7083134735969823
We must meet these challenges together.	0.6861582541239384
The Commission' s communication recommends that experience should be more widely shared, a high-level group formed and benchmarking introduced.	1.2539777119890325
What is more, the report on social security should be published annually and examined in conjunction with the report on employment.	1.30669779902666
This is good, but it is not enough.	0.9037613057083863
We propose a procedure like the Luxembourg process.	0.7947591161792571
Clear guidelines and indicators are required. At the same time, the Member States are to formulate the relevant methods in national action plans.	1.1153166166339232
We are creating a common model, but retaining the principle of subsidiarity.	1.1211304901089625
This social convergence is a process which will continue for a long period.	1.1353136371641717
Parliament must therefore be involved in the work - not by being part of the high-level group, but by enabling parliamentary representatives to track the work of the latter and come up with proposals as to how the process is to be carried on.	1.4764605003218818
Like the work on employment, the Commission' s proposal is founded upon four pillars.	1.2459080510810496
These are: to make the systems employment-friendly; to make the pensions systems sustainable in the long term; to promote social integration; and to guarantee sustainable, high-quality health and medical care.	1.4385444479688312
All this is important.	0.805784492044906
In our report, we have highlighted the importance of combating poverty within the EU and of finding indicators as soon as possible so that we can make progress in this area.	1.483793451060444
Equality has no pillar of its own.	0.7994194492984764
There, it is mainstreaming which applies.	1.1723575756364422
All four pillars should reflect aspects of equality.	0.7141901561139181
This is something we have borne in mind.	1.2856642742274105
We are submitting a wide range of proposals to the effect, for example, that there should be a transition to individualised social security systems; that parental leave should involve entitlement to benefits under the social security systems; that there should be better opportunities to combine family and working life; and that the basic old-age pension should guarantee a decent standard of living.	1.1977850001621353
These proposals favour women especially.	0.5039196357254304
Parallel to this European strategy of social convergence, a concrete plan for legislative work in the social sphere is required, together with proposals for framework agreements in the context of the dialogue between employers and employees, accompanied by a concrete timetable.	1.1420816186670848
We expect the Commission to present this as part of its proposal for a social action programme.	1.3654445270692503
Social convergence is also needed before the enlargement of the Union, partly in order to strengthen the social model and partly to combat the risk of social dumping.	1.1053549988800664
The Commission ought to consider devising a special action programme concerning social policy in connection with enlargement.	1.1170395902856296
We have had a constructive discussion in the Committee.	1.0769400186083429
We had a lot of amendments, but succeeded in agreeing upon a report.	1.1197386265179308
Now, the amendments which are to be voted on at the plenary sitting have been reduced in number to only fifteen.	1.2783294514107892
This indicates that we have a broad consensus.	1.2881368398835304
A number of these amendments have come back from the Committee reading, and these I shall reject.	1.4360203314633442
I shall also reject those amendments which have been tabled by the Technical Group of Independent Members, because I do not think that these add anything to the report.	1.4191622236408736
On the other hand, my group will applaud Amendment No 14 from the group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.	0.8807389885421884
I think this proposal is a good one.	1.3374807637112949
Certainly, it resembles Amendment No 1, but Amendment No 14 is better.	1.3860989355329414
Finally, I want to say that the EU is not only concerned with cooperation on trade.	1.4591045463276506
The EU is also a union for employment and social justice.	1.569260747619824
In creating a citizens' Europe, social policy has an important role to play.	1.0560391920219565
By means of this report, Parliament wishes to make its contribution to reinforcing the social dimension of European society.	1.1707688138425605
We hope that the Council and the Commission will take this contribution seriously and include it in future social policy.	1.280578774694529
The Lisbon Summit will provide an excellent opportunity to present a strategy of this kind.	1.1805289034207296
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Andersson, very warmly on his report on modernising social protection which is now under discussion.	1.2756779392676336
In the capacity of coordinator of the European People' s Party in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I am very pleased with the compromise which was reached and which Mr Andersson put so much effort into.	1.1787986189164006
I am also delighted that he based the report on a report which was written by myself as rapporteur under the previous Parliament and has partly followed the gist of this old report.	1.2651219784601613
The goal of the Commission' s notification of June 1999, on which the Andersson report is based, is to reinforce cooperation between the Member States and the EU in terms of social protection.	1.4249862035077248
Key sub-goals are: promoting employment and ensuring that work secures a fixed income; secondly, safeguarding old-age pensions and making these affordable; thirdly, promoting social integration and fourthly, guaranteeing affordable, first-rate health protection.	1.1788063170693477
Gender-related aspects must feature prominently in all these goals.	0.8718950038864363
I believe that congratulations are also in order for the Commission with regard to this notification, for these four points are, in fact, to a very large number of EU citizens extremely important - if not the most important points which merit further thought.	1.6299791839693187
The Commission' s communication is an important strategic document for bringing about European social convergence.	1.141788513949207
Macro-economic policy, employment policy and social policy all affect each other and this is why they should be brought more closely together.	1.3391495340157462
The Commission has recognised this interrelatedness.	1.1343870230092348
It is our intention to bring about an integrated social strategy which is, of course, underpinned by a sound macro-economic strategy and a sound employment strategy.	1.0995292943011028
These aspects are very much interconnected.	0.8306245293465148
It is, therefore, surprising that this topic has, to date, not been incorporated in a strategy and this is why the Commission' s notification constitutes a break-through in a way.	1.4235316921173005
It brings me great joy to witness that the Council now seems to accept this break-through and also wants to bring it to the fore in Lisbon.	1.1482482663649625
