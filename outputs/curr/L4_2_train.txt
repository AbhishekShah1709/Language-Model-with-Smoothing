Very few of them are X-linked and matrilinear.	0.6352945151287818
Autosomal recessive inheritance is difficult to be assessed in an evidence-based setting.	0.5626317819912942
By linkage analysis, several loci, but no disease gene, have been identified.	0.8351788500969398
At present, few cases of familial dilated cardiomyopathy can benefit of a molecular diagnosis.	0.4353819124866484
As the results of the structural reform policy regulating the health care sector, the paper presents the possible path of increasing intrasectoral risk selection and intersectoral risk externalization (especially between the law of health care insurance, the law of statutory nursing inusrance, and the German poverty law).	0.7231302217406311
Particularly the new developments in the hospital sector will be analzyed regarding the dynamics of risk selection and risk externalization.	0.6413022748972522
The new economic ways of financing the hospital sector are inducing the need of systematic integration of the different branches of social law, especially more developed networks of the health care, the nursing system, and the social care services.	0.8090243277032825
Purpose: The inactive form of pyruvatekinase could be established in different tumours.	0.6100299139989765
Purpose of this study was to demonstate the presence or absence of the inactive form of pyruvatekinase in renal cell carcinoma, metastases and benign renal tissue by immunohistology.	0.5011855390062459
Introduction: The hemodynamic parameters of 95 patients undergoing maxillary or bimaxillary orthognathic surgery in 1996 and 1997 at the Department of OMF Surgery/Plastic Surgery, Krefeld, Germany, were analyzed retrospectivly to study the effect of intraoperative blood loss.	0.5796454539268158
Materials and methods: The parameters included the blood loss volume, age, weight and sex of the patients, the mode of osteotomy and the operation time, the surgeon, the average blood pressure, the infusion volume, the anesthesiologist, the thrombocyte counts and their function, the activity of the coagulation factors II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII and von-Willebrand-factor, and the pathological coagulation factor counts of each patient, the rate of autologous blood donation and the rate of retransfusion.	0.7484686577937503
Statistical analysis was done using the Speraman-Rho-test.	0.4734661772549202
Results: The average blood loss during maxillary osteotomy was 670  +/-  380 ml and during bimaxillary surgery 1120  +/-  510 ml.	0.6306020606763232
Men lost about 300 ml more than women.	0.22802240372709884
Operations of more than 3.5 h in length led to a blood loss of 1200  +/-  520 ml as opposed to 670  +/-  310 ml.	0.6552609603324874
The average blood loss among various surgeons was between 670 ml and 1180 ml of various anesthesiologists between 730 ml and 1200 ml, without statistical evidence.	0.4370178479141141
Some 17.9% of patients showed pathological thrombocytic function concerning medication with aspirin; 34.7% had pathological activities of coagulation factors, but only 2.1% with clinical significance.	0.8266982491911802
Conclusion: Mode of operation, maxillary or bimaxillary, und length of operation were the most significant factors of intraoperative blood loss.	0.5920986025945331
Patients with pathological coagulation had nearly the same rate of blood loss as patients with physiological coagulation.	0.47932813134640323
In most cases this was determined by restriction of aspirin.	0.5851796708102593
Analysis of the rate of autologous blood retransfusion showed a significant correlation to blood loss in bimaxillary surgery.	0.7266601387172521
Maxillary osteotomy led to a retransfusion of only 14.2% of autologous blood unit.	0.6762810815942606
This should be reviewed critically especially concerning costs.	0.3776736063962182
Purpose: Course and pathophysiology of a typical syndrome after irradiation of the cauda equina were studied.	0.464133139289084
Wells' syndrome (eosinophilic cellulitis) is a rare inflammatory skin disease of unknown etiology and pathogenesis.	0.6960154640453825
Only 18 cases in childhood have been reported.	0.4563881954027626
We report on a 5-year-old girl who showed the typical biphasic and recurrent course of the disease: initially edematous-cellulitic lesions associated with blisters, followed by morphea-like changes on the extremities.	0.6605324652090192
Eosinophilia of peripheral blood was apparent, which, however, was not correlated with the severity of the current condition.	0.8103485201513689
After a recurrent course for 4 months and intermittent systemic administration of antibiotics (on the assumption of erysipelas and phlegmon) and glucocorticosteroids, the disease healed without sequelae.	0.7207496137160625
Trigger factors or systemic hematologic malignancy could not be detected.	0.350109214935673
Diskussion: Wells' syndrome is probably more common than believed and should be included in the differential diagnosis of urticarial, morphea-like and bullous eruptions in childhood.	0.4340211651436977
In 1996, several employees of the French governmental organization for Blood Collection and Transfusions (CNTS) have been condemned by ordinary courts.	0.503044693567553
They were found guilty in the affair on HIV-infected blood transfusions.	0.4198140554166573
Over 3800 persons, mostly hemophiliacs, have been infected in France and suffer from HIV disease.	0.534006698671337
Many of them died already.	0.46977159008727815
The public in France urgently demanded the condemnation of the persons who were politically responsible for the time delay that postponed the introduction of HIV-tests for blood donations in France.	0.4786593895590708
Such a test was available from the american company ABBOTT in the early 1985, but the french authorities preferred to wait for the HIV-Test from Pasteur-Diagnostics.	0.6329915270449096
A special court, the "Court de Justice de la République", authorized to judge on members of  the governement, has been created by the French Parliament on Nov. 23, 1993.	0.49504222835816997
Six years later, the three politicians, the former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius, the minister for  Social Affairs, Mme Georgina Dufoix, and  her undersecretary of state for health, Mr.  Edmond Hervé, have been accused of involuntary homicide.	0.660581759791571
March, 9, 1999, after five weeks of deliberations and statements, the CJR rendered his sentence: The former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius and the Minister  G. Dufoix were discharged, but the secretary of state for health, Edmond Hervé, has been declared guilty.	0.5634895020623043
However, also Mr. Hervé could leave the court room as a free person, because the President of the Court, Mr. Christian Le Gunehec, didn't want to pronounce a judgement against him, as Mr. Hervé had to suffer from almost 15 years of public  critics and attacks before he was found guilty.	0.541181524428632
The hemophiliacs and other AIDS-patients as well as their families protested loudly against this judgement.	0.41826475954920905
They plan to file charges against the three ministers through a common court to hold them responsible.	0.30716921662901814
Classical insight therapy, derived from Freud, and `maternal' holding therapy, derived from Balint, Winnicott and others, are two contrasting treatment techniques in psychoanalysis.	0.4903241746161555
The authors believe that each of these two techniques presupposes specific philosophical basic assumptions about the nature of human beings.	0.6202143293523568
The position of Freud is that of the basically traumatic character of human experience.	0.5415436612497424
The contra-position of the object relation psychologists stipulates the priority of love in human experience.	0.32700940464585265
These assumptions seem to be more latent than overt guidelines of therapeutical techniques and therefore their reconstruction and reformulation have important implications for psychoanalytical therapy.	0.43578213020383416
Univentricular hearts represent rare complex cardial malformations.	0.1555521094795675
We report a case of a 34-year old male with single ventricle, two atria, tricuspid atresia, large atrial septal defect, complete transposition and pulmonary valvar stenosis.	0.7234355013488812
There were no signs of chronic pulmonary hypertension.	0.5373277097963566
Intensive clinical analysis of the cardiac malformation was first performed at the age of five years.	0.6539065255580321
Conclusion was that the patient would have no benefit from operation.	0.548823833787229
The patient had nearly normal live conditions with a profession, family and some sportive activities like squash.	0.5219581950220764
He died of sudden cardiac death.	0.29014851347593307
The malformation was examined by sequential segmental analysis and in comparison with the embryonic development.	0.5419317970676988
Clinical picture, prognosis and therapy are reported from literature.	0.6045965737427808
During the last years development of cardiac surgery achieved good results.	0.6590509406248254
Special morphologic constellations, as in our case, may be the reason that conservative therapy can be sufficient for prolonged survival with good quality of life.	0.799188851349948
The assessment and measurement of pain is essential in the implementation and control of pain relieving strategies.	0.673780946602635
The measurement of pain in infants and children should be based on the consideration of age, cognitive level, psychological status, intercurrent diseases and the social context in order to register the child's individual situation and to avoid misinterpretation.	0.694420678739927
From its origin to its death the human organism is submitted to functional, material and morphological changes that are perceptible.	0.4480520248148113
These changes permit classifying an individual as young, adult, old, active or infirm.	0.44675492885798906
But this estimation is not always correct.	0.5038826464871149
Some appear younger, some older than expected from their chronological age.	0.472977226598784
But what is ageing and how can it be measured?	0.2572868157359818
For this, so-called markers or biological markers of ageing are used which are measurable indicators of ageing in live organisms.	0.4763307060143147
A description of the complexity, the asynchronous course and the biological variety and variability of biological age is less successful with a single indicator than with the inclusion of several markers in a multi-factorial measuring system, in a so-called test battery.	0.6940165650383446
Various test batteries have already been applied in numerous studies that consist of biochemical scans, mental and also social parameters in different combinations.	0.5115477370341377
A more precise description of such a test battery can be seen in the following discussion of the ILSE study.	0.8346833756173336
The documentation form for pathohistologic findings (version III) for tumors of the maxillofacial region is presented.	0.5493281916636739
It is part of the site-specific documentation of the German Association of Tumor Centers (ADT).	0.5898372170232716
Its handling is explained by instructions which are based on the ICD-O classification and the TNM system.	0.5266697748423612
The prognostic relevance of the standardized documentation has already been proven by various histomorphologic investigations concerning oral and oropharyngeal cancer.	0.420305097583538
By means of a multicentric observational study the German Austrian Swiss co-operative group DÖSAK will develop a new prognostic model for oral and oropharyngeal cancer.	0.4417851772027441
The development of a middle ear cholesteatoma is usually associated with chronic inflammation and displacement of the mucosa present by the invading squamous epithelium.	0.5804906000524013
To analyze the clinically different behaviors of both epithelia, we used immunohistochemical methods to study the distribution and expression of interleukin-1 (Il-1), transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-), epidermal growth factor (EGF), epidermal growth factor-receptor (EGF-R), the proliferation marker MIB 1, c-myc proto-oncogene product and activation marker 4F2.	0.6197122796278369
Results stromal that keratinocytes in a cholesteatoma exhibited a much higher activation and proliferation rate when compared to middle ear mucosa cells.	0.4769708587560771
Middle ear epithelial cells showed no immunoreactivity for TGF-alpha, EGF-R, Il-1 and c-myc in contrast to the markedly positive immunoreactivity found in cholesteatoma matrix.	0.5606938311895997
The local release of cytokines and growth factors, such as TGF-alpha, EGF and Il-1 by inflammatory cells seems to be an important factor for the hyperproliferative behavior of cholesteatoma epithelium.	0.6647603016037803
Our findings could contribute to the pathogenesis of middle ear cholesteatoma and give a possible explanation for the sustained progression of its growth leading to displacement of the middle ear mucosa.	0.615579749594977
The role of hip sonography in neonatal hip screening is still a controversial matter.	0.576519790084226
This paper reports the results of the Austrian ultrasound hip screening program, in which all Austrian babies undergo hip sonography twice: at the birth clinic during the 1st week of life and at an age of 12-16 weeks.	0.7696938504567148
Data from all public health insurance companies since 1985 and all ICD data about children hospitalized because of CDH in Austria were collected and analyzed.	0.43796367948804615
The rate of sonographically pathological hips was 6.57 % (1994).	0.5718185294166712
The treatment rate before introduction of hip sonography was 13.16 % (1985).	0.6578371906680883
The rate of open reduction went down to 0.24 per 1000 newborns, including a high number of unscreened children born abroad and also children with teratological dislocation of the hip.	0.6207136150705719
Hip sonography screening proved to be effective in detecting true instability of the hip joint as well as dysplasia.	0.5935528204779712
The optimal time for sonographic screening does not seem to be immediately after birth when only "high risk" hips (clinical instability, positive family history, breech delivery) should undergo hip sonography, but at an age between 4 and 6 weeks when the hip has already shown its true nature.	0.6655118031065955
Since one sonographic scan appears to be sufficient for screening, a further reduction of costs could be accomplished.	0.6579224619125441
Disability owing to DDH can be avoided in a number of cases, and costs for conservative and surgical treatment as well as for later endoprostheses and early retirement can be economized.	0.7098408865611825
Transactional analysis (Berne 1958) in its original concepts was intended to help even lay people to understand personal structures and psychodynamic processes.	0.483364860383091
This intention lead some of the following authors to superficiality and a "happy-go-lucky" perspective.	0.47831118704046693
Others, most of all European transactional analysts went back to the roots of the original contents and aims and showed that they offer great clinical relevance for the understanding and treatment of a variety of disturbances.	0.6636957649996059
This article will illustrate these aspects, using the borderline syndrome as an example.	0.6873555572041883
The structural model of egostates serves to describe the borderline structure, concepts of the frame of reference and the script as patterns for the development and maintenance of the pathology, the concepts of transactions, games, symbioses and passivity as indicators for the stable instability of the relationships, and devaluations and grandiosities as examples of defence patterns.	0.5861341931249084
Practical ideas about the therapeutic contract as a basis of various working agreements, about methods of decreasing anxiety in therapeutic processes, and about contact and attachment as a substrate for corrective experiences, a healing atmosphere and dedramatisation of the process follow.	0.5182868758373252
The article ends with transactional analytic considerations of transference, counter-transference and how to deal with regression processes.	0.36693641772028923
After separation of symblepharons in ocular pemphigoid, transplantation of nasal or bucal mucosa is recommended to prevent recurrent lid fusion; however, it is not always successful.	0.5341587852021559
The disturbance of generalized cheerfulness (serene-calmness disorder) is an illness, which is often recognised very late.	0.6848484928600427
It is characterised by a uniformity of psychic experience in the face of circumstances which would otherwise give cause for depressiveness, despair, great anxiety, self-accusations or aggression directed against others.	0.4738914175723842
Early diagnosis and specific therapy may decisively improve life-quality of the patients and may also prevent detrimental individual and social long-term consequences.	0.788267167544528
Disturbances of microcirculation in coronary artery disease can be seen in the presence of critical stenosis of epicardial coronary arteries, as a result of endothelial dysfunction in the absence of significant stenosis or during recovery of ischaemic myocardium after successful angioplasty of stenosed or occluded coronary arteries.	0.613853924072568
Diagnostic methods are morphologic/morphometric analyses, measurement of the global coronary reserve, measurement of the regional coronary microcirculation (scintigraphy, positron emission tomography) and laboratory analysis of haemorheological alterations (plasma, erythrocytes, leucocytes).	0.5038015109642141
After successful angioplasty, normalisation of glutamate extraction rate takes three to six months.	0.4571779034701465
In patients with unstable angina, changes in plasma viscosity, erythrocyte aggregation and neutrophil activation occur.	0.5110748024339529
Neutrophils are activated after successful angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction and even after elective angioplasty (when measured in the coronary sinus).	0.6080531921250768
Therapeutic improvements of disturbed microvascular flow can be obtained by increasing perfusion pressure (by revascularisation, nitrates, calcium antagnoists, physical training), by improving the fluidity of the blood and by reducing the extravascular component of coronary vascular resistance (by antihypertensive treatment).	0.6650383124259424
Intracytoplasmic injection of sperm (ICSI) extracted from testicular tissue (TESE) represents the only possibility for men with non-obstructive azoospermia to father a child.	0.4475641254527996
ICSI is also the only treatment for men with obstructive azoospermia if microsurgery is not possible or not successful.	0.5376810581885152
However, approximately only every fifth treatment cycle leads to a pregnancy.	0.4396898296074516
Thus, in most cases, several treatment cycles have to be performed to achieve a pregnancy and therefore testicular biopsies have to be taken several times.	0.905814495565607
Cryopreservation of testicular tissue offers the possibility to store testicular tissue for several treatment cycles of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and to detach surgical sperm retrieval in the man and infertility treatment in the woman (ovarian stimulation, ovum pick-up, embryo transfer).	0.5857588716564869
For the man, cryopreservation offers the advantage that only one testicular biopsy has to be performed for diagnostic reasons and for sperm retrieval.	0.6255005529709693
The advantage for the women is that infertility treatment is started only if testicular histology confirms spermatids, at least in the testicular tissue.	0.5270353516737254
The cumulative pregnancy rate of IVF/ICSI/TESE-cycles can be increased by cryopreservation of supernumerary pronuclear stage oocytes and embryo transfer after thawing in successive cycles.	0.3549340233543905

In Europe, saprophytic pulmonary aspergillosis represents the only mycotic infection relevant for thoracic surgery.	0.3749363974929376
From the pathogenetic point of view, it is a colonization of preexisting lung or pleural cavities following other severe pulmonary diseases.	0.5188485671659756
The incidence amounts to 0.4% among patients in a special hospital for pulmonary diseases.	0.7359459205150959
Concerning this review, the diagnosis is based on histologic examination for all 66 patients we operated on between 1961 and 1996.	0.7187822628358109
Preoperative proof of the fungal infection remains difficult.	0.32922605801954946
The majority of patients (77%) are male.	0.6980715084276339
There is a correlation between cigarette smoking and abuse of alcohol on the one hand and the incidence of the disease on the other hand.	0.7464942708729081
A higher incidence of saprophytic pulmonary aspergillosis was found for people working in agriculture, in the building trade, and in paper mills.	0.7284989970935762
Pulmonary tuberculosis and pneumonia were present in the past history in 47% of the patients.	0.7646820298497861
Usually, the tentative diagnosis is based on chest x-ray, especially if hemoptysis is present.	0.7250618950081333
Major hemoptysis is the most severe and most dangerous complication caused by aspergilloma.	0.6351156768302442
Clinical presentation and chest x-ray findings are non-characteristic.	0.4527614332279537
Nowadays, the typical x-ray of pulmonary aspergilloma, almost always localized in the upper lobes, became a rare finding.	0.7779546171443612
If an aspergillus infection is suspected, serologic methods are reliable and sensitive.	0.3426831023642504
A surgical procedure is absolutely indicated in patients with major hemoptysis in their history, in case of disease progression or indeterminate mass and in order to avoid fungal dissemination.	0.6693919191401563
If a saprophytic aspergillosis is suspected according to radiologic findings, clinical examination, and patient's social history, an operation is justified.	0.6965617027003976
Relative surgical indications are hepatotoxic and carcinogenic effects of the mycotoxins.	0.4384744432542864
The lobectomy, if necessary carried out as pleuro-lobectomy, is the adequate resection in most patients (68%).	0.7914975804112561
However, this operation is technically demanding and it usually requires a longer operating time as compared to lobectomies for other underlying diseases.	0.6360510304661584
Peri- and postoperative complications occur in 60% of resections for pulmonary aspergilloma.	0.874259669517838
A higher incidence of postoperative complications was found for smaller resections, like segmentectomies or wedge resections, as compared to lobectomies.	0.7480077686312617
Persistent pleural space problems connected with a prolonged stay in the hospital remains the main problem.	0.6849780542066087
It requires a primary or secondary thoracoplasty in a number of patients.	0.4880721338082151
The operative mortality rate is 3%.	0.4074459472104571
A systemic antifungal therapy is not an appropriate treatment for saprophytic pulmonary aspergillosis and can even cause specific complications.	0.5685854554341747
Introduction: Postoperative delirium is a common psychic disturbance occurring acutely after various surgical procedures and typically presenting with a fluctuating course.	0.6109000954409604
These patients' recovery takes longer.	0.2721747194770017
In this study we analyze the incidence of postoperative delirium in patients undergoing vascular surgery and try to identify risk factors for its development.	0.8066413612189153
Methods: Patients undergoing elective arterial operations were included.	0.5708208132698711
Their medical history, the specific vascular diagnosis and operation performed, the medication and laboratory data were monitored.	0.6794105149141252
Additionally the patients were preoperatively interviewed by a psychiatrist.	0.5691284704194262
Intraoperatively the drugs, infusions, possible transfusions, blood gases and pressures were monitored, as were the times of surgery and anesthesia.	0.7170430661055927
Postoperatively patients were seen daily by the psychiatrist and the surgeon for at least 7 days.	0.44825887655491353
Postoperative delirium was diagnosed according to DSM IV criteria, and mild, moderate and severe delirium were distinguished.	0.601041119626067
Results: Fifty-four patients entered the study.	0.4713701232562151
Twenty-one (38.9 %) developed postoperative delirium (11 mild, 2 moderate, 8 severe).	0.8270847859035741
Patients with aortic operations developed delirium more frequently than those with non-aortic procedures(55.5 vs 22.2 %, n = 27 each).	0.5840097471302875
Some preexisting diseases (hearing disturbance) increased the probability of postoperative delirium, while age was not identified as a risk factor.	0.6707155681092206
General psychopathological and depressive disturbances increased the likelihood of postoperative delirium.	0.3797289945393085
Patients who had a severe intraoperative course developed postoperative delirium more frequently.	0.5811365181916395
This was not seen in the absolute time of surgery or anesthesia nor in the intraoperative development of blood pressure or intraarterial gases, which did not differ between patients with and without postoperative delirium.	0.7215608097943814
More reliable parameters were an increased intraoperative need for crystalloid volume, intra - or postoperatively decreased hemoglobin values (Hb < 10 g/dl) and the development of acidosis that had to be treated.	0.8420288294488135
Patients with delirium had serious complications more often (8/21 = 38.1 % vs 6/33 = 18.2 %) and needed Intensive Care treatment longer (2.7 vs 2.1 days, only aortic surgery 3.2 vs 2.4 days).	0.8528128979264253
Conclusions: Postoperative delirium after vascular surgery is frequent.	0.4997613724659447
Patients undergoing aortic surgery, with specific concomittant medical disease, psychopathological disturbances and a severe intraoperative course, are at risk of developing postoperative delirium.	0.6556338819411137

In the SVV test, patients have to orient a dim light bar in an otherwise dark surrounding earth-vertical, using a remote-control.	0.546572987412164
Normal subjects in an upright position did not deviate more than 2 ° from true vertical.	0.37819207436153696
After vestibular neurectomy, the SVV was consistently tilted by some 12 ° toward the affected ear.	0.4698074742451525
Smaller tilts (~7 °) of the SVV occured in patients with spontaneous peripheral vestibular diseases.	0.7771304709994301
This shift in SVV disappeared within weeks to months, similar to the spontaneous nystagmus.	0.5040886421769964
After stapes surgery slight deviations of the SVV towards the unoperated ear were seen in about 20% of the patients, indicating a slight irritation of the otolith organs.	0.6156510811693565
Assessed in an upright position, the SVV thus may be regarded as reflecting tonic otolithic input differences between the two ears.	0.6290689503101057
Introduction: Vocal cord paralysis is a important complication in thyroid gland surgery.	0.36427408573247066
A prospective study was conducted ascertain the frequency of laryngeal nerve palsy not caused by surgical trauma.	0.6646196582606042
Patients and Methods: Two hundred and ten patients were investigated laryngoscopically pre- and postoperatively after short-term intubation in the course of operations far removed from thorax or neck region.	0.5948061387454158
We noted the inner diameter of the tube, intubation problems, the qualification of the anaesthesiologist and the positioning of the patient.	0.7069058749413901
Results: Preoperatively we found previously unknown unilateral laryngeal nerve palsy in 1.9 % of cases.	0.693080742649824
Postoperatively there were pathological findings of vocal cords in 13 patients (6.2 %).	0.6409438131032674
In 10 patients a direct lesion (oedema, rubor, haematoma, granuloma) was established.	0.6005650132953451
Three patients (1.4 %) were found to have a movement disorder caused by a neural lesion without morphological findings, leading to restitutio ad integrum in two of three cases after 6 months.	0.7668819044216316
Conclusion: The frequency of intubation-related recurrent nerve palsy is 1.4 % transiently and 0.5 % permanently.	0.6658985503446767
Preoperative laryngoscopic investigation of vocal cords should be carried out before intubation.	0.35790907350568
Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) are the most frequent infections cause of genital ulcerations.	0.8511724827506199
Although genital infections by HSV-1 are increasing HSV-2 is dominant in recurrent infections.	0.4086141123775838
This study was conducted on a panel of sera collected anonymously in 1996 and 1997 from blood donors (1979 samples) and hospital patients (3079 samples) without risk factors for herpesvirus infections such as STD, other infectious diseases and immunosuppression.	0.6669371330342828
Serum samples were tested with ELISAs using monoclonal antibody-selected native gG1 and gG2 as antigens and an immunoblot using type-specific recombinant glycoproteins.	0.3470461677502528
Equivocal results were confirmed with an in-house Western blot.	0.43917985499168494

We report on three family members suffering from both autosomal dominant Hailey-Hailey disease and bipolar affective disorder.	0.5128861157741482
As molecular biology techniques have made the localization of genes causing simple Mendelian traits possible as a routine task, the gene for Hailey-Hailey disease will presumably be localized in the foreseeable future.	0.5528235607499428
The Hailey-Hailey gene and its chromosomal surrounding will then be a region of interest for linkage studies in bipolar affective disorder.	0.4005282883588019
Background: Osteoporotic fractures occur frequently also in men.	0.35846009804446916
Epidemiologic data from Germany indicate that more than 900,000 men are affected by osteoporotic fractures.	0.4064858566606184
Diagnosis and therapy of male osteoporosis are hampered by a lack of clinical studies.	0.638294846732362
Recurrent headaches and recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) are the most common pain syndromes in childhood: The prevalence of tension headache amounts to 20-50 %, of migraine to 5-7 % and of RAP to 15-30 %.	0.8408401885891645
In nearly 50 % of children the complaints persist over many years of their life-span.	0.6892936648004861
The unfavourable long-term prognosis support the indication of early and specific interventions.	0.6076216774102259
Empirical findings on the etiology, pathogenesis, and pathophysiology are still very limited.	0.5597915436409916
Actual approaches suggest to understand recurrent pain syndromes as a complex and multidimensional disturbance, and in this context there is strong evidence for the major importance of psychosocial influences.	0.761153258299908
The behavioral-medicine proceeding bases upon an extensive family anamnestic exploration and symptom analysis.	0.26952092006975603
The psychological interventions applied in clinical practice include prophylaxis (stress inoculation, cognitive redefinition, problem solving), reduction of pain symptoms (relaxation, distraction, imagination) and environmental modification (parental reinforcement and modeling behavior).	0.5756813842245242
During the last years there has been an increasing trend to create more complex and multidimensional behavioral pain management programs for children.	0.6072329823715785
The aim of our study was to develop noninvasive stereotactic radiotherapy for patients with choroidal metastases.	0.6026503281881103
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is standard therapy for urolithiasis.	0.5183069441606385
With comparable technical principles, various lithotripters have been developed and are in routine use.	0.6304887325078118
Renal pelvic stones, calyceal stones, ureteral stones, and other special forms can be treated with varying results.	0.6762305674019286
Currently, the so-called clinically insignificant residual fragments and the recurrence of calculi are under discussion.	0.5155087478309817
Whereas the side effects of ESWL are well known, studies comparing ESWL with other endourological procedures are still lacking.	0.5554157280349409
Suramin has long been used in the treatment of onchocerciasis and trypanosomiasis.	0.45057012475234565
Recent investigations showed an antiproliferative effect of suramin on prostate carcinoma cell lines.	0.4648760911477113
Ongoing clinical trials have confirmed the effect of suramin on metastasizing prostate carcinoma.	0.50019588367015
Five patients with metastatic prostate carcinoma resistant to classic hormonal therapy were treated with high-dose suramin.	0.6585157360849618
Four of the five developed a papulovesicular or maculopapular rash within 2 - 4 weeks of starting therapy.	0.6211889778073704
The rashes disappeared after discontinuation of suramin within 10 days.	0.29585048193991464
In tumour therapy, high dosages of suramin are used to achieve a serum level of 200 - 300 µg/ml.	0.7358592385723365
Therefore, a toxic reaction to suramin is suspected as the explanation for the skin rashes.	0.5657575936280497
Acetylcholinesterase (ACE) inhibitor-induced angioedema is supposed to be an uncommon cause for oropharyngeal edema.	0.5971212420373457
Between January 1, 1993 and February 1, 1997 we treated 20 patients with edema of the oropharyngeal region that was not caused by infection or irradiation.	0.5985586699654765
The most common reason was an ACE-inhibitor-induced angioedema and occurred in 9 cases, all of whom required inpatient treatment.	0.705304947700529
The medical management consisted of the administra- tion of intravenous (i.v.)	0.5129491487447543
glucocorticosteroids in all cases, H1-blockers in 6 cases, epinephrine by inhalation in one case and i.v.	0.6005502414953567
Tracheostomy had to be performed in one patient.	1.0424237550375706
In our experience it is necessary to reconsider ACE inhibitor-induced angioedma in any case of an oropharyngeal edema.	0.647450836624069
However, there is no reason for the routine application of epinephrine in these cases.	0.8739952818245742
After treatment of more than 3000 kidney and ureteral stones with the Siemens Lithostar Multiline the results of the first 1400 ureteral stone treatments using the "Booster technique" and 3-month follow-up findings are reported.	0.6964662184640062
There was a disintegration rate of 98 % directly after treatment; 1 week after "Booster technique" treatment 96 % of the patients were free of stones and without any symptoms.	0.746808626373749
The 3-month follow-up showed a stone-free rate of 97 %.	0.6125950790377013
Only in 13 % of the cases auxiliary procedures were neccessary, 7 % of them before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and 6 % after ESWL.	0.8417993320311135
43 % of the treatments were performed without any premedication, anaesthesia or sedoanalgesia.	0.6882229102981212
Our data even prove that in situ ESWL is a safe and effective method for the treatment of ureteral stones.	0.5716135767496314
In comparison to endoscopic procedures, it is superior in regard to invasivity, side effects, complications and neccessity of analgesia, while being just as efficient.	0.6252190433562472
Therefore it is recommended as first choice method in the treatment of ureteral stones.	0.6828968871332839
The perspectives for active hearing implants lie in the treatment of patients with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL).	0.4316706293291748
The majority of patients with SNHL suffer from a cochlea amplifier (CA) failure which is discernible by a positive recruitment and loss of otoacoustic emissions (OAE).	0.5029639799169914
Therefore, the electronic implant is expected to partially replace functions of the CA.	0.6179242359193955
Thus, the implant is thought to function as a CAI (cochlea amplifier implant).	0.6211845938283894
An approved implant for routine use is not yet available.	0.5744306698714471
Clinical studies have thus far only used the high energy consuming (HEC), narrow-band, electromagnetic floating-mass transducer, as well as the Maniglia-HEC implant.	0.48521361139564445
The high energie consuming, yet broadband Canadian Fredrickson implant is soon to be used in humans.	0.5575088474812574
Of the piezoelectrical implants, a German CAI (Tübingen implant) at present consisting of a piezoelectrical transducer and a microphone has thus far been acutely implanted in first patient.	0.5781736113024736
It is a low energy consuming (LEC), broad-band implantable system for patients with sensorineural hearing loss.	0.551300910273184
Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) was de-scribed electroclinically by Janz and Christian in 1957 and consists of myoclonic jerks in  varying combination with the absence of seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, a typical circadian distribution on awakening, sleep deprivation, alcohol consumption and flickering stimuli as characteristic precipitating factors, typical EEG abnormalities with generalized epileptiform discharges, normal physical and neuroradiological findings, and often a family history of epilepsy.	0.5361429849087437
Although the misdiagnosis of this well-classified and easily treatable syndrome is supposed to occur rarely in Germany, we retrospectively investigated how often the wrong initial classification had been made among patients who were finally treated in our outpatient epilepsy unit.	0.6118852931618487
Between 1993 and 1995, 30 patients with a typical JME-like symptom constellation were identified who had been misdiagnosed initially.	0.6283077391326793
In all patients, localization-related epilepsy had been classified, although regional EEG abnormalities were rare (n=5).	0.5503186472257318
All patients reported the typical circadian distribution, abnormal neuroradiological findings were absent, and typical EEG abnormalities were present in all cases.	0.7057619396819581
Under treatment with appropiate antiepileptic drugs 97% of the patients became almost completely seizure-free.	0.5811449228658166
Even 40 years after the first description of the syndrome, JME is an underdiagnosed illness.	0.7360589220359759
The generally  positive course underlines the importance of its correct identification.	0.3335182039335041
Background: The aim of the study was to evaluate results of visual acuity and binocularity and complications after cataract surgery with primary capsular bag-fixated IOL implantation in children.	0.6081025201820558
Arterial hypertension is known to be an important risk factor for cerebral and cardiovascular disease.	0.8748790502253762
Previous studies have demonstrated alterations in the perifoveal microcirculation in patients with essential hypertension.	0.5580814898186964
During follow-up a progression of these alterations has been reported.	0.572856681639884
In the present study we quantified the retinal microcirculation of patients with hypertension under different systemic antihypertensive medication.	0.612981384812498
Vaginal and uterine bleeding is a common symptom in gynecology.	0.5204458810442678
The cause of the bleeding should be investigated so as to exclude carcinoma as its origin.	0.6197464340201455
First, the basic circulation parameters should be determined.	0.5739502497262682
Blood volume and oxygen substitution are essential.	0.39558613390100217
Depending on these findings, further diagnostic or therapeutic steps must be undertaken.	0.6198107111270204
If the situation is stable, diagnostic measures are indicated to localize the bleeding and the tumor.	0.6441414645472695
A general examination, including a vaginal and rectal examination, must be performed.	0.6675562701976148
Other diagnostic procedures such as ultrasound (vaginal and transabdominal) and CT or MRI may be required.	0.6229390454189465
If available, an angiography should be performed.	0.5282730102766043
Medium-term results with a follow-up of at least 3 years were done in 160 patients (average follow up 51 months) after ACL reconstruction using IKDC evaluation form and Noyes score and in 110 patients (average follow Up 53 months) after non-operative management.	0.8328677121790451
Unlike objective good parameters the subjective assessment of knee function according to the Noyes score reveals significantly worse results in cases with ACL reconstruction compared to the knees without surgery.	0.5810693986064959
The best functional results we found in professional athletes after ACL reconstruction.	0.4781553184261417
Comparable positive results of knee function is only achieved in approx.	0.5104174365298406
15 % of the patients from the natural history group, who can maintain high risk pivoting activity level feeling no giving way.	0.7240171870256445
In our opinion compensatory proprioceptive mechanism account for the surpassing results in these two groups of patients.	0.7263455660103827
It will be postulated that it is not the absolute power of the hamstring but the latency period of recruition that influences the compensation of anterior knee instability.	0.5908148767966566
We have modified our rehabilitation methods in order to improve proprioception and dynamic stability of the ACL-deficient knee.	0.5242038839449149
Based on our results we primarily limitate the ACL reconstruction on a group of patients practicing high-risk-pivoting sports.	0.7047785683685808
Only when menisceal lesions appear or patients suffer from giving way episodes we support secondary surgery.	0.315651728178381
The pivot shift sign is reflecting the dynamic aspect of knee instability.	0.3117848731797607
In our opinion it is the decisive parameter to assess knee instability unless there are useful technical procederes.	0.6472022054991724
Multiple injuries in elderly patients are still a common problem.	0.9106923534294947
The present study was performed to investigate mortality and complications in multiple trauma patients aged 65 years or more.	0.8074848193829055
A total of 1154 multiple trauma patients with an injury severity score (ISS) of at least 18 points were divided in two age groups: Y: 16 - 64 years, n = 1022; O: 65 - 94 years, n = 132.	0.6821291028785055
Older patients were injured as pedestrians in most cases (69%), while younger patients were more frequently injured as car and drivers passengers (41%).	0.6036430075188769
ISS was comparable in both groups (Y 28 +/- 1, O 27 +/- 1).	0.8475444342363896
During ICU-therapy incidence of ARDS (Y 10%, O 11%), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MOF; Y 6%, O 9%) and pneumonia (Y 17%, O 21%) were comparable.	0.7429508517227499
In contrast, septic complications were more frequent in older patients (Y 19%, O 27%).	0.6958839078839536
Length of ICU stay (Y 19 +/- 2, O 18 +/- 1) and ventilation time (Y 14 +/- 2, O 17 +/- 1) were comparable.	0.8347737146602603
Mortality was significantly higher in older patients (Y 15%, O 53%).	0.6797976804011275
The major cause of death was sepsis in older patients (Y 15%, O 31%) and MOF in younger patients (Y 54%, O 29%).	0.7365926264356137
In conclusion, older trauma patients had a higher mortality due to the development of septical complications.	0.6519405148811435
The Raynaud phenomenon occurs in 90-100% of patients with systemic scleroderma.	0.7011121509661936
It is caused by dysregulation of the vascular tone between vasocontrictive and vasodilatory influences.	0.452788479200888
Early damage to the vascular endothelium and the activation of platelets lead to the release of vasoactive substances.	0.5682944094752964
Structural and function impairment of the perivascular neural fibers contributes to the vasospasm.	0.44004562765305927
New vasodilatory treatment strategies, e.g.	0.2732297874709547
infusions with calcitonin gene-related peptides, could be useful in the control of vasospasm in the peripheral extremities as well as internal organs in systemic scleroderma.	0.6277984466007513
Due to the limited efficacy of drug therapy in atrial fibrillation and the high rate of recurrence, strong efforts were made to find non-pharmacological strategies.	0.6854943999126138
For three years now, the implantable atrial defibrillator Metrix from InControl has been available as an alternative therapy.	0.5906953940881698
From October 1995 to the present the atrial defibrillator was implanted in 179 patients worldwide.	0.5317465820803273
The sensitivity of the system and its algorithms to detect atrial fibrillation is 90%; the specifity to detect sinus rhythm is 100%.	0.6769960379479184
In 121 of 179 patients, 748 episodes of spontaneous atrial fibrillation were treated with 2.4 shocks per episode.	0.5746353699018694
No proarrhythmic event or stroke was seen.	0.16806579593692023
A cardioversion to sinus rhythm could be achieved in 95% of patients; the overall clinical success rate was 88%.	0.8285795736586613
In 7% of all patients, early recurrence of atrial fibrillation (ERAF) occurred that could not be converted into stable sinus rhythm after further cardioversions and antiarrhythmic therapy.	0.6979410885818971
In 4.1% there were lead-related complications, in 4 patients the device had to be explanted because of ineffective therapy, and in 3 patients the device had to be changed because of loss of telemetry or early depletion of battery.	0.7343150110066446
In 8 patients, postoperative complications were seen (infections, pneumothorax and thrombosis of the subclavian vein).	0.7173207216578009
Overall, the implantable atrial defibrillator Metrix is an effective and safe alternative in treating atrial fibrillation.	0.7362205570632514
Background: The success rate of combined glaucoma and small incision cataract surgery is not yet established.	0.7514056372176554
The somatosensory system of preterms and newborns differs substantially from adults.	0.2968986143420146
These differences are of considerable preclinical and clinical interest.	0.38382193302503964
Maturation of A- and C-fibre synaptic connections in the dorsal horn and development of descending inhibition from the brainstem all take place postnatally in the rat.	0.5730739035866714
In early stages of development there is no definite spatial sepraration in the dorsal horn between the nociceptive and the non-nociceptive system.	0.6069495372435447
In preterms but not in adults non-noxious stimuli can induce central sensitization.	0.4034620280759446
Many neurotransmitters and signalling molecules involved in pain pathways are expressed early in the developing nervous system but do not reach adult levels for a considerable period.	0.41153212481101037
More important, receptors are frequently transiently overexpressed or expressed in areas during development where they are not seen in the adult and may have a different functional profile.	0.5686133127368929
The descending pain inhibitory system that provides an important protection against central sensitization developes later than the ascending nociceptive system.	0.4012448314884872
Thus, during a critical period of time the immature nociceptive system is highly vulnerable.	0.752408481412373
For example, neonatal circumcision in the absence of analgesia results in increased pain responses during subsequent routine vaccination months later.	0.3628716392421178
Numerous studies conducted during the past decades indicate that the public's attitude toward the mentally ill is strongly prejudiced.	0.502501480151928
Since the attitude of the general public also has an effect on community-based psychiatric care, we must ask how public opinion might be influenced.	0.6007633964107694
One possible approach could be through so-called key community leaders - those who are highly respected in society because of their competence in a particular area.	0.5493784501435234
Doctors belong to this group of people.	0.48090396742689445
For this reason we questioned medical students, as future key community leaders, with respect to their attitudes toward the mentally ill within the framework of their first contact with psychiatric patients during their studies.	0.604333339649398
In order to make a direct comparison possible, we interviewed a sample of the Mannheim population who live in a part of the city where a variety of complementary facilities have been set up.	0.5666101703448972
The comparison shows that medical students do not have a more positive attitude toward the mentally ill; in fact, in certain areas they have an even more negative attitude toward the mentally ill than the general population has.	0.6306188902216562
We were not able to establish what effect teaching has with respect to changing attitudes.	0.31437897729802544
Systematic lymphadenectomy for colorectal cancer aims to remove potentially metastatic lymph nodes from the tumor's drainage basin.	0.4849988795297771
This requires knowledge of normal lymphatic anatomy and metastatic routes.	0.3918319758211352
Systematic lymphadenectomy performed as a standard or as an extended resection is a prerequisite for pathologic tumor staging.	0.5925305562249171
An intensive search by the pathologist for lymph node metastases is critical for precise staging.	0.4600143914815653
Recommendations as to the extent of lymphadenectomy are derived from potential improvement of prognosis and procedure-related complications.	0.5518981748559592
Life threatening hemorrhage in patients with malignant tumours of the head and neck area are often, as a result of tumour infiltration, postoperative anatomical changes, infection and radiological necrosis, difficult to control.	0.753478226742844
One option for prophylaxis and treatment is the ligature of the external (ECA) or common carotid artery (CCA) and superior thyroid artery (STA).	0.6454972710880118
52 patients were examined in a retrospective study to determine both the hazards and the therapeutic use of the procedure.	0.8979851541996301
The external carotid artery (ECA) was ligated prophylactically during the operative procedure of tumour resection and neck dissection in 25 patients.	0.6361426031806838
In 27 cases closure of the ECA, CCA or ECA and STA was carried out as an emergency procedure for acute hemorrhage following completed primary treatment (operation, primary or postoperative radiation or radiochemotherapy).	0.5873377933992155
There was no postoperative hemorrhage after prophylactic ligature of the ECA.	0.5262505156975629
One patient with multiple cardiovascular diseases suffered from an ipsilateral cerebral infarction 1 year after operation.	0.6306835459028101
In 6 of 9 patients and in all 3 patients, in whom ligature of the CCA or ECA and STA respectively was carried out as an emergency procedure, severe neurological complications up to an apallic syndrome occured.	0.7349013555239756
The number of deaths due to acute hemorrhage was considerably smaller among those patients with prophylactic ligature of the ECA performed during operative procedure of tumor resection and neck dissection.	0.5793668124111258
In addition there were much less unfavourable courses in the sequence of prophylactic closure of the ECA than observed after ligating the CCA or ECA and STA in an emergency situation.	0.5258992719506895
The carcinoid tumor of the middle ear is a very rare neoplasm which in general is regarded as benign but may be mistaken for an adenocarcinoma because of its histological heterogeneity.	0.6250252622652831
Typical, however, is its neuroendocrine and mucinous differentiation so that an unequivocal diagnosis is possible by means of immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy.	0.5823519021048847
As the tumor is very rare, there is no statistical evidence as to whether further treatment is necessary after primary exstirpation of the tumor.	0.7646222190384089
Therefore, a review of the literature was performed.	0.8350129774870257
We report about a 28-year-old male patient with a carcinoid tumor of the left tympanic cavity.	0.7577777062036019
Without any further treatment there has been no evidence for either recurrence or metastases 32 months after surgical resection.	0.6536189599124974
As treatment of choice we recommend conservative surgery with complete removal of the tumor and a clinical follow-up on a regular basis.	0.7800880245294636
Intraoperative precision in computer-assisted surgery depends on the characteristics of a navigation system, the precision of correlation between object and data set, the position, number and fixation of landmarks, and the parameters of the data set.	0.773887527066945
The characteristics of a navigation system, in particular the immanent precision, can be detected by the use of the geometric model and navigation analyzer developed at the University of Regensburg with the support of Carl Zeiss, Germany.	0.705212781345992
The precision of five navigation systems of different types and technology was measured: Viewing Wand (ISG, mechanical system), the SMN microscope (Carl Zeiss, infrared system with laser autofocus), the MKM system (Carl Zeiss, robot platform with laser autofocus) and the STP pointer (Leibinger, infrared system).	0.5615216119607246
The immanent precision of these systems ranges from 0.1 to 2.0 mm.	0.9779015792991556
An electromagnetic system (3-Space Digitizer, Polhemus) was compared; this produces serious spherical deviations of 10.0 to 20.0 mm in the presence of metal, surgical and rotating instruments, and circuits.	0.7822695921148225
The application of these different systems for craniomaxillofacial surgery is discussed.	0.5111804944493423
The aim of the study was to record retrospectively the events of Pneumocystis carinii-Pneumonia (PCP) among HIV-infected children (<18 years) in Germany.	0.7886433748716201
The patients were evaluated with regard to prophylaxis, course of disease and prognosis.	0.9548863350580974
In this study we looked at the relationship between extracorporal circulation and changes in blood electrolytes.	0.713074217220335
Glucocorticoids are a potent cause of osteoporosis and thus a potential source of substantial morbidity in patients who are already significantly disabled by their underlying condition.	0.5925204069602278
These agent interact with calcium metabolism at many levels; in particular they reduce the osteoblast's synthesis of the principal proteins of bone matrix.	0.5460966169255022
They also reduce circulating sex hormone concentrations, particularly in men and postmenopausal women.	0.5287451412335182
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), which form a rare group of neoplasias of the gastrointestinal tract, have not yet been fully investigated.	0.6299454438252323
Although good progress has been made in their diagnosis, classification of these lesions with regard to their histogenesis and biological behavior remains problematic.	0.6575690669840171
Between 1994 and 1998, 18 GIST patients underwere operation in the Department of Surgery.	0.5002129117050194
Twelve of these patients (67 %) had stromal tumors in the stomach, and six (33 %) had intestinal stromal tumors.	0.8398221225735287
The primary tumor could be removed in all patients with R0 resection.	0.9070813195167132
Six patients developed hematogenous liver metastasis, with the size of their primary tumor exceeding 10 cm.	0.6505320120658846
Extrahepatic distant metastases were not found in any case.	0.6487096066539155
Lymphadenectomy showed that lymph node metastases did not occur.	0.4433304489112815
Histological evaluation was made according to the guidelines of Lewin, Weinstein and Riddell.	0.4304785821339509
Currently established therapy is limited to complete surgical resection of the primary tumor and its metastases.	0.8542134523145128
Adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy approaches have failed.	0.24067556436615586
Acute leptospirosis in Europe (Weil's disease) is a rare and in more than 90 % of the cases undiagnosed febrile, self-limited disease.	0.8028293603012395
We report the case of a 39-year-old sewerage worker, who was admitted to our hospital with fever, jaundice, pain in his calves and acute renal failure.	0.6615592087491037
Serology revealed elevated antibody titers against Leptospira canicola, L. icterhaemorrhagica and L. sejroe.	0.32615463719004956
The patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with diffuse gastrointestinal bleeding due to thrombocytopenia.	0.57934729706723
The ECG showed atrial fibrillation with irregularly irregular rhythm.	0.44668021001225344
Cardiac arrest developed, most likely due to hypoxia, with a drop in the blood pressure.	0.8319430356694129
Despite immediate resuscitation efforts the patient developed severe hypoxic brain damage and died a few days later.	0.6143131616078514
Autopsy disclosed histologic signs of a generalized leptospiral infection, signs of shock and within the lungs a necrotizing herpes simplex virus pneumonia causing the death of the patient.	0.5311571759034002
The virus pneumonia most probably was caused by retrograde canalicular dissemination of oral secretions since herpetic tracheitis and esophagitis were found and herpetic lesions were readily identified on the lips and tongue.	0.4044601423968548
A medical opinion asked for by the professional association having liability for occupational safety and insurance was given, the disease being recognized as an occupational disease.	0.5681854140738936
During the past decade, the molecular mechanisms in the process of tumor progression, including metastasis and angiogenesis, have become better understood.	0.8171882602668753
Cancer metastasis consists of multiple, complex interacting steps.	0.3985616836241244
Each of these steps is crucial and limiting, since a failure to complete any one prevents the tumor cell from producing a metastasis.	0.5463251806156715
Detachment from the solid tumor by loosening the intercellular junctions and proteolysis of the extracellular matrix enables tumor cells to enter blood- and lymph vessels.	0.4787393045504763
The intravasation into the circulation is supported by the secretion of angiogenic factors, which induce degradation of the basal membran in blood vessels.	0.6227834518213443
Adhesion to endothelial cells, extravasation from the circulation, and induction of angiogenesis are further essential steps for completing the metastatic process.	0.48127549132829517
Furthermore, it is well known that once a tumor cell has entered circulation, it will survive only by evasion of the immune system.	0.6604866581349039
The systematic identification of tumor antigens opens up new possibilities for immunotherapeutic approaches.	0.31020169648510665
Hypogonadism is the main indication for testosterone substitution in the ageing male.	0.4655178711672608
The choice of the testosterone preparation should be based on the principle that serum levels of testosterone remain in the normal range and fast termination of therapy is possible.	0.6057863053100337
To date, transdermal testosterone systems appear to be best suited for substitution therapy in the ageing male.	0.44195542627360423
Future promising developments are testosterone gels and intramuscular testosterone undecanoate.	0.19898208554870206
Any testosterone therapy in the ageing male has to be monitored closely, especially regarding erythropoiesis and the prostate.	0.619898847667926
Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is a disease that involves the lining of joints, bursae and tendon sheaths.	0.5318207846131077
The incidence is low and estimated to be 1.8 patients per million population.	0.6291152303898591
The cause of PVNS is unclear and discussed to be either inflammatory or neoplastic.	0.4638292589063404
PVNS has been described in 2 forms different for prognosis and treatment (nodular and diffuse).	0.5634210249013447
The articular form almost appeares in the knee joint as we describe below in a 14 year-old patient.	0.6030253072283341
In this retrospective study, 13 patients with subtle Lisfranc joint injuries were examined after a mean period of 23 months using clinical assessment, radiography and dynamic pedographic gait analysis.	0.5135389816607219
The aims were to identify the factors leading to a mobile flatfoot deformity, evaluate the functional and clinical outcome of these injuries, and draw practical conclusions for initial management and subsequent intervention.	0.6211280685222811
All patients showed a mobile flatfoot deformity, increased motion in the subtalar joint, increased load on the hindfoot, decreased load on the forefoot, and a prolonged contact phase during the stance phase.	0.7393879002430718
Radiographs revealed progressive osteoarthrosis in the joint and a residual displacement of the medial Lisfranc joint.	0.5975469832412841
An unstable medial Lisfranc joint results in the development of a mobile flatfoot.	0.6685708444942694
Initial treatment of a subtly displaced Lisfranc joint should consist of exact anatomical reduction and additional maintenance of the longitudinal arch of the foot.	0.5257929017065964
After failed initial treatment, early arthrodesis of the midfoot is recommended as a salvage procedure for the foot.	0.6734102604598198
Cross-sectional imaging with CT and MRI plays an indispensable complementary role to endoscopy in the pretherapeutic workup and staging of laryngeal neoplasms.	0.5149419185575469
Adequate interpretation of the CT and MR images requires a thorough knowledge of the patterns of submucosal spread and familiarity with the diagnostic signs of neoplastic invasion as seen with each modality.	0.5598440671864287
In addition, the radiologist should be aware of the implications of imaging for staging and treatment.	0.5160233107451685
Both CT and MR imaging are highly sensitive for the detection of neoplastic invasion of the pre-epiglottic space, paraglottic space, subglottic region and cartilage.	0.5104447266327524
The high negative predictive value of both CT and MRI allows exclusion of neoplastic cartilage invasion quite reliably.	0.4938445001241275
The specificity of both CT and MRI is, however, limited and both methods may therefore overestimate the extent of tumor spread.	0.6024670846935719
Nevertheless, both cross-sectional imaging methods significantly improve the pretherapeutic staging accuracy of laryngeal tumors if used in addition to clinical examination and endoscopic biopsy.	0.6857769811188648
In the presence of a submucosal mass, CT and MRI play a key role for the diagnosis, as they may characterize the lesion, reliably depict its submucosal extent, and guide the endoscopist to perform deep biopsies that allow a definitive histological diagnosis.	0.658588644420747
Background: HLA-DR antigen plays a key role in transplantation immunology.	0.5013252508812739
Organ culture storage leads to loss of HLA-DR-positive corneal Langerhans cells.	0.37066147011633255
This study investigates the importance of prolonged storage period for the success rate after penetrating keratoplasty.	0.6042412803071778
Ergotamine-containing drugs are widely used in the treatment of acute migraine attacks.	0.5933301204912885
Among others, spastic vasoconstrictions are one of the possible side effects usually affecting the lower extremities and sometimes leading to gangrene.	0.522498170489151
The case of a 75 year old woman is presented who was suffering from migraine-attacks since adolescence.	0.613574241806266
Due to longterm use of ergotamine containing suppositories she developed perianal ulcers.	0.2666242277819716
After withdrawl of the drug the ulcers healed up entirely.	0.4832865490023345
The spectrum of ergotamine-induced side-effects and possible intervention strategies are discussed.	0.5586334403530342
In this article, a model of quality assurance for inpatient psychotherapy is discussed, which was developed in cooperation between researchers and clinicians.	0.7946780622647495
This model is based on the concept of internal quality assurance with external help.	0.5910780175051968
The Heidelberg Model of Active Internal Quality Assurance has three elements: (1.)	0.6375946452074812
a QA-Inventory for routine monitoring; (2.)	0.6723580408118631
rules for evaluating the outcome of every patient and (3.)	0.8458349323607741
a feedback model for communicating the results to the therapists (quality circles).	0.4363961848900635
The focus of this model is the recognition of problematic results.	0.5755060123297737
It is mainly these results that will be discussed in our quality circles, where the outcome of treatments from the perspective of the inventory and of the therapists are discussed.	0.6966416355934346
This feedback model and the quality circles will be explained with three examples of patients.	0.5066466028371093
The Heidelberg Model of Active Internal Quality Assurance will be seen as the basis of a concept of Quality Assurance, which is aimed at assuring and improving the quality and rationality of the psychotherapeutic service.	0.6899089549641834
Aims: In this study the technique of intravenous regional anesthesia (Bier block) was evaluated as an experimental tool to differentiate peripheral and central effects of analgesics.	0.8128253296439872
A pre-term infant weighing 900 g, gestational age 25 weeks, developed an acute abdomen.	0.5162402631975189
Intravenous lines had been inserted previously in the left (silasticcatheter) and right (24 G cannula) saphenous veins in the neonatal intensive care unit.	0.6455038543855022
During surgical exploration, a perforation of the terminal ileum was found.	0.5661399440701165
The operation consisted in partial resection of the perforated ileum with an end-to-end anastomosis and a double-lumen colostomy.	0.46532810916018397
Major blood loss during the procedure caused serious haemodynamic problems.	0.47798683473934195
Despite transfusion of erythrocyte (100 ml), thrombocytes (75 ml), and albumin (50 ml), the patient developed bradycardia and hypotension.	0.8230747194762673
Administration of atropine, adrenaline, and calcium IV had no effect.	0.5009442053512015
The operation could be finished only with extrathoracic resuscitation.	0.308604819590497
When the drapes were removed, livid, swollen lower limbs raised the suspicion of an acute thrombosis of the inferior vena cava.	0.5275747962064468
After insertion of a 24 G IV cannula into a vein of the right upper arm, the circulation stabilised after rapid transfusion of 40 ml blood and 25 ml thrombocytes and resuscitation was successful.	0.6139759528856192
Paediatricians and anaesthesiologists must consider the risk of thrombosis of the vena cava.	0.508309678238369
If venous lines in the lower limbs are not visible to the anaesthesiologist during the operation, venipuncture of veins of an upper limb is recommended before starting the surgical procedure.	0.6159972319346317
Due to the high incidence of vena cava thrombosis caused by central venous lines and the difficulty of peripheral venipuncture in pre-termintanty, a safe venous line should be inserted if necessary by pre-operative venesection.	0.577985511450541
While complementary medicine and homeopathy is becoming an increasingly prominent part of the health care practices, there is a lack of controlled studies concerning their effectiveness.	0.5834501364130594
In our study, we wanted to answer the question whether a combination of Formica rufa D6 and reinjection of the patient's own blood is superior to injection of placebo.	0.6927769519935142
104 patients with ankylosing spondylitis entered a prospective, randomized, double-blind study.	0.43142257703031295
During four weeks they received twice weekly either 1 ml of Formica rufa D6 in combination with 0.5 ml of blood or 1.5 ml NaCl intramuscular.	0.7004287864458191
Before and after therapy, mobility, thoracic excursion and doctor's overall assessment were measured in addition to patient's health status, using a German version of the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales, before and after therapy as well as four, twelve, and twentyfour weeks later.	0.703954373943965
We were not able to detect any statistical difference between treatment and placebo group in any of the parameters measured.	0.5843178903481828
Therefore, the therapy under study may not be regarded effective.	0.6394312695160576
A 32-year-old man was accused of attempted rape.	0.5010746350630232
While urinating at the side of the road he felt an erection.	0.355694056209606
He approached a 9-year-old girl who happened to be coming along and pressed his penis between her legs until ejaculation.	0.4474910942078521
Shortly afterwards he was arrested.	0.1873856218648545
He confessed, but claimed partial amnesia and had no explanation for the offence, which he normally would never have thought of.	0.5571209212237217
Shortly before the event a witness had seen him nearby in a poor state of orientation.	0.36243662715858077
Three months later in prison he suffered massive subarachnoidal hemorrhage from an aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery.	0.5361037638047776
The evaluation of his legal responsibility must take account of a putative psychomotor seizure at the time of the offence.	0.5144938072503338
With regard to the aneurysm diagnosed later, a pathogenetic connection, in terms of a preceding warning leak, might be assumed.	0.6540804064686292
We present a 43-year-old patient who has had up to 15 frontal lobe seizures nightly for 12 years.	0.594446749896956
The patient had no complaints apart from excessive daytime sleepiness.	0.5480774701254331
Neurological and psychiatric examination as well as cerebral computed tomograph and magnetic resonance imaging were normal.	0.4663409229050742
After sleep deprivation an interictal electro-encephalogram demonstrated a recurrent excess of theta activity over the right frontal and frontopolar area.	0.3317785280380655
A cerebral PET study showed diminished glucose metabolism of the right cingular and frontomesial region.	0.5043723443197479
The sleep structure was extremely fragmented.	0.22453908880628856
There was an excessive reduction of slow-wave sleep and REM sleep.	0.4958029166148711
Carbamazepine therapy produced complete seizure control lasting a few weeks, followed by return of up to 8 seizures per night.	0.41211800670787846
Vigabatrin as add on therapy diminished the noctural seizures to 1 to 3 per night.	0.35758725677974923
Introduction: We attempted to optimize the determination of energy expenditure and substrate utilisation in VLBW infants for practical use in a tertiary care center.	0.494065996801393
The influence of measuring conditions upon results as well as of caloric intake and food composition on substrate utilisation and growth were investigated.	0.4638189900678144
We report a truck driver with severe soft tissue contusion of both legs who developed atypical heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) after a thrombosis prophylaxis with unfractionated heparin; despite a thrombosis the patient showed a systemic allergic reaction to heparin in combination with elevation of thrombocytes and positive heparin-dependent antibodies.	0.6177185613190783
Six days after the initial trauma deep vein thrombosis of the left lower leg was diagnosed and fasciotomy was performed, preventing an imminent compartment syndrome.	0.7211130899579643
Another 5 days later the patient developed exanthema of the trunk and upper extremities and urticaria on his face, as well as severe headache.	0.6739388666825876
His platelet count increased from 134 000/µl to 258 000/µl.	0.31942262449574665
After exclusion of other causes for these symptoms, a reaction to heparin-dependent antibodies (heparin-platelet-factor 4 complex) was demonstrated 2 days later.	0.696869856962512
Thrombosis prophylaxis was changed to hirudin (Refludan) and elevation of thrombocytes to 445 000/µl was noted.	0.49465726022735795
Shortly after rinsing of an intravenous line with less than 50 IE unfractionated heparin at day 36 after trauma the patient developed an anaphylactic shock, which could be managed with cortisone.	0.6416012054101655
We suggest that in HIT the thrombocytopenia may represent only one form of an allergic reaction to heparin.	0.5261633861029067
The cause of the thrombembolic event is an antigen-antibody reaction to heparin taking place on the surface of the thrombocyte.	0.5706047580540851
This is similar in all forms of systemic reaction to heparin application, even though the symptoms may vary.	0.7097962289016939
As thrombocytopenia may not be the main symptom of a heparin-induced antibody reaction - in our hospital only 5 of 10 patients with HIT - the disease should rather be named "heparin allergy".	0.8516697514599698
We suggest a new classification of different pattern of heparin allergy types I-IV.	0.5416427380700186
The new types I and II are similar to HIT types I and II.	0.45900913204816773
Type III is the reaction of antibodies without decrease of thrombocytes, and type IV the reaction of antibodies associated with systemic allergic symptoms.	0.5570011740129192
In recent years, lengthening the human mandible by distraction osteogenesis has become an accepted treatment to correct severe mandibular hypoplasia.	0.48634295417737405
Using intraoral unidirectional and extraoral bidirectional distraction devices we report about our experiences and results in the application of the bone distraction technique in four selected cases of syndromal disease, including various forms of mandibular hypoplastic malformations.	0.6815879818770111
The patients involved were a boy with Pierre Robin syndrome, a girl with unilateral facial hypoplasia in Goldenhar's syndrome, a case with Nager's syndrome, and a rare case of midline deficiency caused by partial deletion of chromosome 18 (18p-syndrome).	0.6406479525835108
The distraction period lasted from 6 to 30 days and new bone formation, ranging from 6 to 28 mm, was achieved.	0.6583811966878611
Real leg length discrepancies may be cosmetically disturbing and lead to gait abnormalities, pelvic obliquity with subsequent lumbar scoliosis as well as functional disturbances of hip, knee and ankle joint.	0.4932313443808127
Morbidity and mortality after reversal of Hartmann's procedure following perforated sigmoid diverticulitis are high and the rate of intestinal restoration is low.	0.5098011077046843
Aim: To investigate whether laparoscopically assisted reversal of Hartmann's procedure is technically feasible and whether the laparoscopic procedure offers any benefit to the patient.	0.6156634329190409
Method: Nineteen patients were investigated.	0.4711516574250464
The postoperative course was followed prospectively.	0.5191556507178656
All patients were reinvestigated 9 months after surgery.	0.6713987279804816
Results: Laparoscopic reversal of Hartmann's procedure was attempted in 19 patients.	0.5146780801714244
One patient did not want the laparoscopic technique.	0.3895466973430075
In two cases (11 %) conversion to the conventional technique was necessary; thus, 16 patients were operated laparoscopically.	0.7947823861948985
Median operative time was 114 (65-180) min.	0.6084661669976918
With the exception of three wound infections no immediate postoperative complications were noticed.	0.4281718414842324
Patients' convalescence was fast.	0.20275798098784956
First evacuation took place 3.3 (3-5) days after surgery, complete oral nutrition 3.6 (3-5) days after surgery.	0.9919214499584681
Duration of postoperative hospitalisation was 7.5 (5-12) days.	0.882507969005602
One patient developed later a clinically significant anastomotic stricture which needed endoscopic dilatation.	0.4158826393288183
Conclusion: Laparoscopically assisted Hartmann's reversal is technically demanding but feasible.	0.3771363968692935
Postoperative morbidity is low, duration of hospitalisation short, convalescence fast.	0.449138798376153
Thus, good arguments exist for performing reversal of Hartmann's procedures laparoscopically.	0.4700793766454921
Mechanical ventilation is a well-etablished strategy in intensive care medicine.	0.566894022658241
ICU trauma patients require analgesia, and sedation mostly consists of benzodiazepines and opioids with increasing doses over time.	0.501033416344913
The weaning period is complicated by the withdrawal syndrome, showing tachycardia, hypertonia, tachypnea and restlessness.	0.4669475585628991
Although treatment with clonidine can influence these symptoms, tachypnea still remains the main problem in weaning patients from mechanical ventilation.	0.5273168092784134
Adding sufentanil, an opioid with greater effects on analgesia than on respiratory depression compared with fentanyl, tachypnea can be reduced to normal frequency.	0.6108618859419195
In this way weaning management can be managed more easily for the benefit of both, the patient and physician.	0.903377982517761
In comparison with a group of 50 patients treated with clonidine alone, 72 patients treated with clonidine/sufentanil showed a shorter period from the start of spontaneous ventilation until extubation (4.8 vs 7.6 days) and until discharge from the ICU (7.7 vs 12.4 days).	0.8396889012036195
The number of reintubations caused by respiratory exhaustion decreased from 16.0 to 2.8 %.	0.5629004812928421
Background: With regard to penetrating keratoplasty methods to culture corneal donor tissues, microsurgical techniques, HLA typing and understanding of basic mechanisms in inflammation and especially graft rejection, and postoperative treatment schedules have been improved in recent years.	0.5973343715342561
This now enables successful penetrating keratoplasty in many more patients than previously performed.	0.33768876774780965
However, in rare cases relevant problems in wound closure may appear.	0.5762543972646911
The occurrence of a new influenza virus subtype in 1997 in Hongkong caused only minor outbreaks due to the swift and determined actions of the institutions involved.	0.47481812119480477
However, this incident again made it clear that an influenza pandemic is still a pending threat.	0.5817035604287707
As a result the WHO presented a pandemic preparedness plan which is to facilitate the global measures taken to fight an imminent or ongoing pandemic.	0.5311649292183778
Strong efforts of influenza surveillance and the coordination of worldwide measures are essential to this plan.	0.4240528209356173
Furthermore the WHO suggested the developement and introduction of similar national preparedness plans.	0.33193602013462187
Given the high mortality of severe sepsis and septic shock, immunomodulation has been considered as an attractive adjunct therapy.	0.5700122342618749
Many agents have been studied that have the therapeutic potential to interfere with cytokines and other pathways which are activated during sepsis.	0.46329857806323144
Drugs having the properties to neutralize lipopolysaccharides have also been considered.	0.3216253198830573
So far all the large clinical trials with immunomodulating agents (HA1A, E5, anti TNF antibodies, ILra) have been shown to be of marginal or of no benefit.	0.6290733645833726
In certain trials results were indecisive, or mortality was increased which led to discontinue the studies.	0.47772347456638364
In certain other trials, like those on antibodies against TNF, some positive effects were seen in subcategories of patients.	0.6395081580169644
Thus, new trials are on their ways.	0.5708178802421295
So far the results of early trials has forced investigators to re-examine the concept of immunomodulation, and to redefine strategies to optimally use agents in a way that benefits the host, while not putting him at risk.	0.6281450194260341
Recently, percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy (PDT) has become more frequent, since the technique can be mastered relatively easily.	0.7584996423319973
PDT is neither time-consuming nor does it require much personell or material.	0.37187075029128314
Our study seeks to evaluate PDT in terms of its effectivness and practicality on a cardio-surgical ICU.	0.34972609516719155
Recently, two new halogenated volatile anaesthetics, sevoflurane and desflurane, have been approved for clinical use in Germany.	0.7274367298967291
Their low solubility in blood is the most important common property, and this represents the most obvious difference from the inhalational anaesthetics currently used.	0.6873427148752043
Extensive clinical and experimental evaluations have confirmed the superior pharmacokinetic properties predicted.	0.45686407601095974
Both sevoflurane and desflurane provide more rapid emergence from anaesthesia, permit easier titration of the anaesthetic dose during maintenance and offer more rapid recovery from anaesthesia.	0.3917662669090129
For sevoflurane, there are additional advantages: a pleasant odor, negligible airway irritation, and excellent pharmacodynamic characteristics that even provide cardiovascular stability comparable to isoflurane.	0.556093411618432
A certain disadvantage and source of potential nephrotoxicity result from the metabolism of sevoflurane (2-5%) to anorganic fluoride and degradation to compound A in carbon dioxide absorbents.	0.6324268444844698
The extensive clinical data reported to date have revealed no evidence that sevoflurane has adverse renal effects.	0.5823595097976464
New insight into the pathomechanism of nephrotoxicity associated with either production of fluoride or compound A may well support clinical experience.	0.38839853503442967
Desflurane strongly resists in vivo metabolism and because of this it appears to be devoid of toxicity.	0.38724956162182717
Nevertheless, potential side-effects may result from degradation in dry absorbents and subsequent release of CO, from its extreme pungency and irritating airway effects.	0.5212133928671012
Thus, desflurane is not recommended for induction of anaesthesia, especially in children.	0.7089441037236658
The tendency for desflurane transiently to stimulate sympathetic activity, especially at concentrations above 1.0 MAC, limits its application in patients with cardiac disease.	0.6528634314418361
The doctor in charge, who is generally the medical director, is liable if patients suffer harm through organizational faults within his or her department.	0.5628312275609609
Even the suspicion that an error has arisen as the result of defective organization is enough for the person responsible - that is to say the medical director - to be liable.	0.7018060445544623
For this reason, the doctor in charge must be in a position to recognize structural defects in organization and to correct these by means of staff training.	0.5725840444275915
Every training measure must guarantee specialist standards; this means that the work of doctors with no specialist training and those still in training and working under supervision is guaranteed to be of the same standard and performed with the same degree of meticulous care as that of a qualified specialist.	0.661233396899852
A legally valid consent from the patient and documentation of the patient information must be accessible at all times.	0.7097317269780858
Operations carried out by doctors in training must be supervised by a qualified specialist; otherwise the doctor in charge is guilty of a defect in organization.	0.4919928775971693
Because of staff shortages it often happens that inexperienced beginners - often doctors doing their practical training - are on call very early on.	0.5468998423710583
In the high-risk specialty of obstetrics it is particularly important that doctors still undergoing practical training can call on an experienced colleague for help at all times.	0.5467880705261491
The changeover from day duty to emergency duty must be organized by the doctor in charge in such a way that the medical staff are rested and that adequate free time is guaranteed.	0.45571267636684387
There must be no friction when cooperation with other disciplines concerned is needed.	0.33443397953915976
Each sector must know its own area of responsibility.	0.25762603767863823
The doctor in charge is resonsible for seeing that his or her staff members are familiar with the use of the medical equipment.	0.5033826948822255
Uniform guidelines will make it possible for the medical director to train his/her staff and prevent systematic organizational defects.	0.48882372915417044
Georg Friedrich Stromeyer (1804- 1876) is generally known as one of the founders of orthopedics and orthopedic surgery and also made many contributions to modern military medicine.	0.48692331248675025
Furthermore, every oral and maxillofacial surgeon in Germany knows him because of the "Stromeyer hook", which is used for elevation of zygomatic arch fractures.	0.6910981245646347
This special aspect as well as Stromeyer's biography is presented in this article from the history of medicine.	0.5846753452665949
Changes in clinical presentation of Crohn's disease (CD), patients' age at the time of disease manifestation and operation, general condition and duration of medical management were investigated in a retrospective study.	0.7397999148436627
395 operations for CD were divided into consecutive groups and analysed.	0.3549274275418095
In an increasing number of cases patients presented with the "fibrostenotic type" rather than the "fistulizing type" of complaints.	0.7000664363450539
The duration of disease and of medical management increased.	0.7461381597147546
Patients in later groups were younger and in better general condition.	0.34507312180659033
We found a rise in frequency of patients with recurrent CD or prior abdominal surgery for other reasons.	0.6205808381692279
Primary surgery for CD increasingly consisted of resection of solitary segments of gut; in the case of recurrence, of multiple, minimal resections.	0.6563512233730961
The average total length of the resected intestine could be significantly reduced.	0.5070448731486494
The complication rate was equal in elective and emergency surgery.	0.492016019085649
Even among the uncommon aneurysms of the visceral arteries the aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenalis artery is considered a rarity.	0.4691591227995676
Etiologically, numerous factors must be taken into account, the most significant one being arteriosclerosis.	0.7526250806734676
The clinical presentation is unspecific and ambiguous.	0.5359808779702436
CT and, above all, intra-arterial DSA allow for a diagnosis.	0.5229589579574507
A generous consideration of indicating operative intervention, even in asymptomatic patients, is especially justified because of the imminent risk of rupture.	0.6791892412018926
The preferrable therapy consists of elimination of the aneurysm either conventionally by proximal and distal ligature of the pancreaticoduodenalis artery or endovascularly by embolization.	0.447148967760114
In the future a treatment with coated stents (TPEG) would also seem possible.	0.6119931520363574
Special attention must be paid to concomitant occlusive disease in other visceral arteries since measures for vessel reconstruction may be required because of intraoperative impairment of the collateral circulation.	0.49878603322843695
We report on the rupture of an aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenal inferior artery in association with celiac axis occlusion.	0.6216943291051682
Background: Clinical courses of eight patients with urea cycle disorders (deficiencies of carbamylphosphate-synthetase (4), argininosuccinate-synthetase (2) and argininosuccinate-lyase (2) ) are described.	0.6617007303056072
Methods/Therapy: Emergency treatment consisted of benzoate and arginine i. v. as well as peritoneal dialysis and/or modified hemodialysis.	0.5150110848546275
Chronic treatment comprised a low-protein diet and substitution of essential amino acids, of benzoate or phenylbutyrate and of branched-chain amino acids.	0.47913966603345803
Results: Within 72 hours after birth hyperammonemic coma with cerebral edema developed, leading to developmental retardation later in life.	0.4294136983685628
Four patients died between 2 weeks and 4 years of age.	0.6423295513737183
During follow-up, all patients suffered hyperammonemic derangements treated conservatively.	0.6103337451146427
Phenylbutyrate had less gastrointestinal side-effects than benzoate, branched-chain amino acids had favourable effects.	0.3918413743919435
One patient was treated conservatively since birth followed by a normal development.	0.7058511368932877
Conclusions: Neonatal respiratory distress with alkalosis and rapid global deterioration should raise the suspicion of a urea cycle disorder.	0.3776327985518256
Specific therapy as described can be life-saving, although most children exhibit marked developmental delay.	0.5586141130860058
Sodium phenylbutyrate has fewer side-effects than sodium benzoate.	0.43387235329384666
Therapy prior to cerebral edema can prevent complications.	0.3562337685076224
Pronounced osteoporosis of and surrounding the acetabulum commonly leads to early loosening of endoprosthetic hip replacements following implantation.	0.325468509980581
Large osseous defects in the subimplant bed are the result and the reason why multiple revisions of loosened acetabular cups have to be performed so often in rheumatic surgery.	0.5466142917128599
The defects extend from the cranial to the central; ventral and dorsal anchorage losses may occur in addition to this.	0.5852446724792266
The anchorage of a new implant must be adapted to the individual circumstances.	0.7042925145865936
The new implant must be selected in accordance with point of surgical access, the patient's general status and osseous regenerationability.	0.7164069010202395
In the optimum case, osseous buildup of lost anatomical structures is the preferred method.	0.3786129439400325
If this is not possible, special implants, mostly custom-made prostheses, have to be incorporated.	0.8414666016266782
However, the survival time of the implants is much shorter than in patients with degenerative diseases.	0.8810853876618294
In patients with progressive muscular dystrophy (PMD) invasive electrophysiologic studies can detect hidden intracardiac conduction disturbances.	0.4711894128579659
The aim of this study was a long-term follow-up of these patients.	0.8190762613948851
Twelve consecutive patients (9m, 3f, age 28 +/- 4 yrs) without cardiac symptoms and with normal echocardiographic findings were included in the study.	0.664029881642584
They suffered from different stages of PMD type Erb (n=4), Becker-Kiener (n=4), Duchenne (n=2) and Landouzy-Déjerine (n=2).	0.361442288529519
At the beginning of the study all patients underwent an invasive electrophysiologic study (EPS).	0.6874167656940345
The follow-up of 5.5 yrs included regular clinical visits, ECGs, and Holter recordings (every 3 months) as well as an echocardiography every 6 months.	0.646085099464352
In 4 patients the EPS revealed a hidden interatrial conduction disturbance (AHRS-ACS 120 +/- 18ms), and in 10 pts an infrahisian conduction disturbance was found (HV max.	0.5583414280451927
Conduction defects were seen independently from the type of PMD and the stage of the disease.	0.5036712703354106
During the follow-up the initially hidden interatrial conduction disturbance became evident in the surface ECG in 2 of 4 pts.	0.5497856872477112
One of them developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.	0.45104298467155857
Five of 10 pts with an initially hidden infrahisian conduction disturbance developed an AV block grade I-III and in one case additionally a bundle branch block.	0.5630752752609209
Four of these pts - whose PMD showed progression or who developed congestive cardiomyopathy - needed pacemaker implantation because of a first-degree AV block + bifascicular bundle branch block (n=1), a Mobitz II second-degree AV block (n=1) or a third-degree AV block (n=2).	0.612377882703662
None of the pts with normal findings at the EPS showed abnormal p-waves, an AV block, or an intraventricular conduction disturbance during the follow-up.	0.5832539360033319
We conclude that intracardiac conduction disturbances, especially infrahisian defects including high-degree AV blocks, are a common finding in pts with PMD.	0.7323677005589742
Therefore a regular cardiological screening including an ECG and a Holter recording is reasonable in these patients.	0.37842440699922947
Accidental hypothermia is defined as an unintentional decline in the core temperature below 35 °C and is caused by exposure to cold, drugs, endocrine dysfunction, central nervous system disorders, skin disorders, and trauma.	0.5968164359577398
Depending on the degree of hypothermia, there is a progressive depression of metabolism in each organ system with specific alterations.	0.6316690028857528
Bone is among the most common sites of metastatic disease in cancers of the breast, prostate, and lung.	0.7657918070086436
The decision about systemic therapy depends on the histology, presence and extent of extraskeletal disease, and the performance status of the patient.	0.7559859654579945
For patients with estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer or prostate cancer, hormonal treatment represents the treatment of choice.	0.610460449451395
In estrogen-receptor-negative breast cancer, and for patients who have failed hormonal therapy or have liver metastases, chemotherapy should be initiated.	0.7581600397570041
All patients with small-cell lung cancer should receive chemotherapy.	0.5552542800733583
Bone metastases of differentiated thyroid cancers can be treated with radioisotopes.	0.5473909707884709
In non-small-cell lung cancer or renal cell cancer, systemic chemotherapy should be confined to younger patients and patients in good general condition.	0.6268628238138982
Radiologic assessment of responses of skeletal metastases to systemic therapy is often difficult.	0.5807144173225345
New approaches in measuring bone metabolites in urine might prove helpful.	0.35151239357821873
Although most prenatally diagnosed anatomic malformations are best managed after birth, we can presently offer prenatal therapy to an increasing number of fetuses with simple anatomical defects that have predictably devastating developmental consequences.	0.4745737253812395
A condition amenable to prenatal intervention must fulfill a number of conditions.	0.31154047128472523
It must be severe enough to warrant the risks associated with in utero treatment and must be reliably detectable before birth.	0.44285692317606434
Furthermore, the pathophysiology must be reversible by fetal intervention, significantly improving the prognosis over postnatal treatment.	0.5410738885369206
Current indication for prenatal intervention include decompression for obstructive uropathy, temporary tracheal occlusion for congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and tumor debulking for congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lung and sacrococcygeal teratoma.	0.5718184196894086
Prenatal repair of myelomeningocele is currently being developed but remains controversial since this is not a lethal malformation.	0.6021990966828554
Maternal safety remains paramount in considering fetal intervention.	0.18281778965640066
The main associated risks are pre-term labor and preterm premature rupture of membranes.	0.42368835089649537
To reduce maternal morbidity and the risk of prematurity, minimally invasive fetoscopic techniques were developed and are increasingly employed.	0.5145339568546249
These developments will in all probability reduce the importance of open fetal surgery in the future.	0.5062644790193744
Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) has become an important cause of severe infection in hospitalized patients all over the world.	0.69051921349756
In Germany a significant increase of nosocomial infections due to MRSA has occurred during the last 10 years.	0.6581076214397671
Especially elderly patients with chronic illnesses are at increased risk of becoming colonized or infected with MRSA.	0.5559211282756094
This report focuses on epidemiology and therapy of MRSA, and on the recommendations concerning management and prevention of spread of MRSA in hospitals and nursing homes.	0.6252827243924685
During general anaesthesia gas climate significantly is improved by performance of low flow techniques.	0.40780150047827196
Gas climatisation, however, markedly also will be influenced by the temperature loss at, and corresponding water condensation within the hoses, factors which are related to the technical design and material of the patient hose system.	0.6479820964478094
The objective of this prospective study was to investigate 1. how anaesthetic gas climatisation during minimal flow anaesthesia is influenced by the technical design of different breathing hose systems in clinical practice.	0.6992737370986785
2. to investigate, whether a sufficient gas climatisation also can be gained with higher fresh gas flows if that hose system is used, proven beforehand to optimally warming and humidifying the anaesthetic gases.	0.5563525977979256
Introduction: Undifferentiated, embryonal sarcoma is a rare malignant tumour of the liver, the incidence of which is highest in children between 6 and 10 years of age (14.1 %).	0.8121855261412171
Among the primary tumours of the liver in childhood it ranks in third place after hepatocellular carcinoma and focal nodular hyperplasia.	0.508798059893087
Embryonal sarcoma is much rarer in adults.	0.3815718678581447
To our knowledge, only 18 cases have been published in the last 50 years.	0.8637610801623709
Methods and results: We now present the case of a 29-year-old woman with spontaneous rupture of the liver caused by an undifferentiated sarcoma.	0.7237366102145362
Conclusion: This case report illustrates the possibility of an embryonal sarcoma being the reason for spontaneous rupture of the liver.	0.7258388664735094
The management of this case comprised primary tamponade, interventional embolisation of the feeding artery, and secondary resection under stable conditions.	0.6536869438857209
Substance dependency is one of the most frequent disorders, which can be treated successfully by psychotherapy.	0.8245417143907946
However reasons are discussed, why psychotherapists probably hesitate in treating these patients.	0.34814555246157913
Insufficient psychotherapeutic education concerning dependency, structural problems, expected difficulties with these patients or expected poor treatment outcome may be overcome as well as blind areas in healthprofessionals' perception concerning dependency among their patients and themselves.	0.4221976134777972
Though psychotherapy with addicts is sometimes exhausting, the readiness of psychotherapists to treat patients with substance disorders is increasing.	0.4613081660331639
Diagnosis nowadays is based on the distinction between drug depencency and drug abuse on the one hand and substance induced disorders on the other hand.	0.5266565781494287
Readiness for change and motivation for treatment are basic objects of psychotherapy in these patients.	0.5434410505206574
Therapeutic approaches to deal with this promising aspect of psychotherapy are presented.	0.4426870030628089
They are based on an empathic and clear therapeutic attitude.	0.5069350741787435
They can be easily implemented in different settings.	0.5148462568014669
At the end of the first part of this review in- patient and outpatient settings for the treatment of substance disorders are outlined.	0.738356561802762
This will be followed in the second part by an outline of different specific psychotherapeutic approaches.	0.5850509859862265
The following experimental study was conducted to develop biocompatible methods of osteosynthesis in fractures of the distal radius and to evaluate their stability.	0.7088824620011823
A model of dorsal wedge osteotomy in the distal radial metaphysis was used to develop the surgical technique and to test the stability of the alternative methods of osteosynthesis.	0.7291652693287798
The concept for this model was based on commercially available materials which were either biodegradable or osteoconductive.	0.42976431199822607
Four different forms of biocompatible osteosynthesis were compared to combined Kirschner wire osteosynthesis (KWO), our preferred method of treatment of unstable Colles fracture.	0.6179490987073663
Biocompatible osteosynthesis was achieved with an invasivity and stability comparable to that of KWO.	0.5496529035330905
In conclusion, injection osteosynthesis exceeded the other biocompatible methods of osteosynthesis in all respects.	0.43886812129025754
Regarding the recent developments in injectable materials for osteosynthesis it offers the best perspective for clinical application.	0.41532415796132965
The "pain in the lower limbs" (growing pain) represent one of the most frequent complaint pictures in the child orthopaedic consulting hour.	0.7746090045807066
The delimitation compared to other diseases is difficult and laborious on account of many differential diagnoses.	0.47618862492238856
Destination of our investigations was it to set up a standardized investigation diagram with recording all differential diagnoses.	0.32618225323791245
In psychotherapy with patients who do not tolerate the conditions of the 'talking cure' because they tend to act instead of verbalizing their experiences interactive entanglements are rather common.	0.4399803076379352
Often this is a consequence of nonverbal gestural behavior that directs interaction in the therapeutic dialogue while the exchange of words has taken a back seat.	0.48519706846452143
The symbolic space of verbal understanding gets lost then.	0.2071013413725331
Gestural behavior does not form an independent communication system as usage of 'body language' suggests.	0.31758626662226264
Instead as permanent concomitant of utterances it has primarily the function of regulating the interaction of patient and psychotherapist.	0.4231460545647024
The surgical treatment of varicous veins demands complete exclusion of the primary recirculation circuit.	0.5474894951468687
The diagnosis is made on the basis of the clinical and ultrasound symptoms, on i.e.	0.8642311523083844
If there is saphenous vein agreement between them, phlebography will yield no additional information concerning the strategy for operation.	0.4729443149435726
The prospective comparative examination of non-invasive diagnostic methods versus phlebography shows different results in 12% of cases for the great saphenous vein and in 3% for the small with a correction of the operative procedure.	0.8319322861589697
In 10 cases of incomplete trunk varicosis, only one diagnosis was correct with non-invasive measures.	0.7628993511516258
This leads to the conclusion that phlebography should be done at the time of the preoperative examination if there are differences between the clinical and ultrasound symptoms.	0.8812986940942712
Undislocated odontoid fractures may lead on the basis of conventional x-rays only to a wrong conclusion with regard to biomechanical aspect of stability.	0.48701557577898746
In this aspect the classification based on Anderson and D'Alonzo takes a high risk to missunderstood the fracture stability and can results in a secondary fracture dislocation.	0.5617400266017628
Therefore it is important to make the decision about operative versus nonoperative treatment on the base of the trauma mechanism.	0.6839008830226466
In this case report we elucidate this problem and the higher risk of anterior approach for correction.	0.6644890333913842
Furthermore a better classification of densfractures will be recommended.	0.3115601856525842
In a period of 4 years between March 1994 and March 1998, 143 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) underwent laparoscopic antireflux surgery.	0.5610019853424344
According to manometric studies 76 patients had a short-floppy Nissen fundoplication, patients with impaired motility or paraesophageal hernias received a hemifundoplication (Toupet = 42, Dor/Thal = 25).	0.49328527075183703
Recurrent reflux symptoms appeared in 6,3 % after mean 16,7 months follow-up (Nissen = 2.6 %, Toupet = 2.3 %, Dor/Thal = 24 %, P < 0.01).	0.5916150987894329
Persistent dysphagia with reoperation occurred in 2.1 % (Nissen = 2.6 %, Toupet = 2.3 %, Dor/Thal = 0 %, n. s.).	0.6220199432205421
The assessment of Visick's score at the latest control showed the following: Visick I = 63.6 %, Visick II = 30.1 %, Visick III = 6.3 %, Visick IV = 0 %.	0.5686301127804932
The outcome of the operation was rated "excellent" or "good" by 91.6 % of the patients.	0.7076159189458867
In contrast to auditory brainstem potentials (ABR), a more apically defined generation of middle latency evoked potentials (MLR) can be assumed due to the longer integration time present.	0.6139492017948903
To date, the effect of stimulus frequency spectra on MLR has not been completely known.	0.5152854698463419
By using masking with high-pass filtered white noise in 12 normal-hearing adults, we measured the dependence of amplitude and latency of ABR and MLR on filter frequency.	0.5458119729522749
No differences were found between the masking effects for ABR and MLR evoked by tone bursts of 0.5 and 2 kHz.	0.6814555081652002
The high-pass masking of click stimuli showed a greater influence on the amplitude and latency of the ABR than on MLR.	0.6038531850272569
These different qualities have to be considered clinically when evaluating the methods and results of hearing testing with acoustic evoked potentials.	0.6445749585824709
Our findings show that MLR evoked by tone bursts should be used for the frequency selective diagnosis of hearing thresholds, especially in low- frequency ranges.	0.6903369707366573
Objectives: To clarify the incidence of sudden arrythmic death and associated risk factors in patients after orthotopic heart transplantation (HTx).	0.6569806286935593
Background: Some reports indicate a significant rate of sudden death in heart transplant recipients limiting long-term success of the operation.	0.7137155475014626
Incidence, underlying risk factors, etiologies, and methods for prediction or prevention of sudden death are poorly defined.	0.5658556090435187
Methods: Retrospective analysis of our cohort of 120 cardiac allograft recipients surviving the perioperative phase out of a total of 142HTx patients of the years 1984-1999.	0.5593937135129866
Clinical events (death, mode of death, Re-HTx, resuscitation) were noted and analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and related to the patients' characteristics by multivariate analysis.	0.7142239074509767
Sudden death in or out of hospital was defined as death within one hour of symptoms or unwittnessed death.	0.560782578804516
Clinical and postmortem findings (autopsies are available in 12/18 sudden death patients) were correlated to the mode of death.	0.6598328549145346
Results: During a mean follow-up interval of 4.6 +/- 3.5 years, 45 patients died (38%).	0.8806589181044091
The mode of death was non-sudden in 27 inpatients.	0.5513616593673394
18 deaths were sudden, 14 of these out of hospital.	0.48892637412700257
In addition there were three cardiac arrests with successful resuscitations, one of those patients died three month later suddenly, giving a number of a total of 21 cardiac arrests in 20HTx patients.	0.6154362232331788
The actuarial risk of cardiac arrest was 20% after 6 and 40% after 12 years.	0.9062455259001749
Based on postmortem analysis the etiologies of the events were attributed to transplant vasculopathy in 15 patients, rejection in 5 patients (International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation grade >3A), and to unknown reasons in one.	0.6097078767723744
All three patients successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest had documented bradycardic events (2xtotal AV block, 1xsinus arrest).	0.3629333348587968
Pacemakers were implanted in these patients.	0.39311405678184
One of those died suddenly 2 months later.	0.4545930094356603
Significantly more HTx patients dying suddenly are smokers, had a lower left ventricular ejection fraction, and worse hemodynamics.	0.5867001555941386
QRS width and PR interval were significantly broadened in patients with transplant vasculopathy and cardiac arrest.	0.38463418909762553
In three cases, a decrease in heart rate variability, the occurence of sustained VT, and ST segment depressions prior to the cardiac arrest could be demonstrated.	0.7347492201070436
Conclusions: Sudden death occurs at a substantial rate after HTx.	0.4148625109846369
As HTx patient numbers are rising constantly, sudden cardiac death in this population will represent a significant problem.	0.5688198980204044
In our patients about 75% of the arrests can be attributed to graft-vasculopathy and one quarter to acute rejection.	0.5946469197283941
Diagnostic strategies have to be developed to detect patients at risk.	0.6412523372081319
Interestingly, some events may be caused from bradyarrhythmic rhythm disturbances.	0.553564005949413
Introduction: Traumatic dislocation is the most severe ligamentous injury of the knee.	0.7512602936669812
The indications for operative and conservative treatment are still controversial.	0.6078049766283193
Methods and results: From 1974 to 1994, 38 patients with documented knee dislocation were treated operatively in our department.	0.6412984710373189
Thirty-four of these patients were followed up for 3-16 years (mean: 8.6 years).	0.9539290457190652
In 29 cases of the follow-up group, reconstruction of both cruciate ligaments was performed.	0.5315439483866702
In the remaining cases the cruciate ligaments were left alone.	0.5875694662440674
At the time of follow-up, 90 % of the patients showed good knee stability, but 90 % had lack of motion as well.	0.8420933678353782
Post-traumatic osteoarthritis was mostly mild to moderate.	0.4136643785708717
Thirty-five percents of the patients achieved excellent to good results in the Lysholm Score.	0.7022522213668008
Conclusions: Positive prognostic factors were an age less than 40 years at the time of the accident, a low-energy trauma, e. g., a sports-related injury, early reconstruction of both cruciate ligaments, and initial postoperative functional treatment.	0.6958547521749545
Huntington's disease (HD) is member of a growing family of neurodegenerative diseases which are caused by a CAG-Triplet expansion in the coding region of their respective genes.	0.5345904880943477
The results of the research of the last years is very suggestive of a common pathomechanisms of all these diseases even though their clinical appearance may be quite different.	0.6930499020738197
The development of new animal models by transferring the human gene defect into the mouse genome has led to the finding of so-called intranuclear inclusion bodies.	0.4973643342680579
This new observation allowed to come closer to solving the problem how this genetic defect causes neurodegeneration.	0.33931589572644294
Recent studies on transgenic HD mice could also demonstrate a possible connection between the genetic defect and glutamate exitotoxicity in the neurodegenerative process of HD which had been emphasized by earlier animal models of the disease.	0.503844134284088
Transgenic animal models of HD will have an important impact on the understanding of the disease mechanisms and may contribute to a faster development and testing of new therapeutic approaches.	0.7597814340152309
Background: The Whipple operation (PD) is the standard operation in patients with cancer of the head of the pancreas and the periampullary region.	0.9068989971800449
However, the pylorus-preserving duodenopancreatectomy (PPPD) is supposed to be superior in gastrointestinal function.	0.7325978526009878
Methods: In a prospective randomized trial (October 1994-October 1998) PD and PPPD were compared in terms of global and gastrointestinal quality of life, operation time, duration of hospital stay, transfusions and perioperative morbidity.	0.6837082891021383
Quality of life was analyzed under standardized conditions (EORTC-QLQ-30) pre- and postoperatively (weeks 2, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60).	0.7580775574794205
Results: A duodenopancreatectomy was performed in 48 patients because of cancer of the head of the pancreas (n = 38) and the periampullary region (n = 10) (PD, n = 24; PPPD, n = 24).	0.7876906610119068
The PD and PPPD groups did not differ according to age, gender or UICC stage.	0.5353977578911532
Operation time was shorter in the PPPD group (206  +/-  48 vs 306  +/-  54 min) (P < 0.05).	0.5905601374569808
Morbidity did not differ between the two groups (PPPD 20 % vs PD 30 %, P > 0.05).	0.811781844360459
While there was no difference in global quality of life, gastrointestinal quality of life was postoperatively increased in the PPPD group regarding appetite, nausea and diarrhea (P < 0.05).	0.5596702183107164
While the preoperative body weight was reached after 6 months in 85 % of the PPPD group (n = 20), this was true in only 60 % of the PD-group (n = 14) (P < 0.05).	0.6616676108345815
Conclusion: PPPD seems to be associated with a better postoperative gastrointestinal quality of life than PD.	0.5622807151098744
Oxygen uptake (V.O2) and carbon dioxide elimination (V.CO2) can be measured with an indirect calorimeter; this method is well established in routine monitoring of ICU patients to evaluate metabolic state as a reflection of stress.	0.7321910533368172
In various experimental studies it was demonstrated that anaesthetics can influence whole-body metabolism.	0.42372000461725606
The purpose of this study was to examine whether indirect calorimetry can be used intraoperatively during routine anaesthesia and whether presumable changes in metabolism can be detected immediately.	0.6373449779234311
Abdominal aortic cross-clamping changes circulation, nutritional supply of the lower extremities and thus V.O2 and V.CO2.	0.640076129790724
We therefore used this operation for our study.	0.33953798149507336
For certain indications, anterior fusion of the lumbar spine is a standard operation.	0.7299085586763348
The surgeon specializing in operations on the vertebral column must leam to utilize the advantages of laparoscopic surgery.	0.5047763666495759
However, an absolute must before applying the technique to humans is adequate training in its use in living animals.	0.5592175253602171
For this purpose, the pig is a highly suitable model.	0.6720352142139384
The surgical team comprises a surgeon experienced in spinal procedures, an abdominal surgeon with expertise in laparoscopic surgery and an experienced cameraman.	0.6111181700976099

The desmoplastic type of the squamous cell carcinoma (DSCC) of the skin is an entity which is readily distinguished by light microscopy.	0.730982958887369
The DSCC has fine branches surrounded by a desmoplastic stroma and shows in some cases typical perineural, perivascular and widespread intradermal invasion (maximum 6 cm!).	0.46075816386112595
This type accounts for 8.2% (n=44) of our collective of 594 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the skin and vermilion border.	0.7678285004973372
Clinically DSCC look like other malignant epithelial tumors of the skin.	0.5069336530537996
All tumors were followed up for at least 3 years (maximum 10 years).	0.689598006173791
The local recurrence rate was high (24.3%) even though micrographic surgery was carried out.	0.7683050279861579
The rate of local or regional metastasis was also very high (22.7%).	0.6604697040121532
In comparison the recurrence rate and the rate of metatasis of the remaining common 91.8% SCC's (n=550) was low: 2.6% and 3.8%, respectively.	0.7566303490263664
The DSCC seems to be identical with the so called neurotropic SCC, the fine stranded SCC or the SCC with perineural invasion which have a high rate of local recurrence and metastasis as well, but DSCC is a better generic histopathologic term for the entire group.	0.5918026573458638
The DSCC is best treated with micrographic surgery and wider safety margins than any other type and should be followed up very frequently.	0.524156619357883
In the final stage of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) the majority of patients develop chronic respiratory failure due to respiratory muscle weakness.	0.5960635720010458
The interaction between the patient with ALS and the physician should be characterized by continuous communication, especially with respect to the prospect of ventilatory failure and for support.	0.7694103757726971
The patient and his family must be informed thoroughly about the natural history and the prognosis of ALS, depending on the individual disease process.	0.7361757155442177
Already in the early stage of the disease coping strategies should be discussed so that imminent respiratory emergencies can be handled.	0.7368168583416154
If ALS patients are not informed about the acute respiratory insufficiency they run the risk of having to be intubated and mechanically ventilated over a long term.	0.6107180116857186
Background: The advent of multidetector CT (MDCT) constitutes a quantum leap creating a wealth of new opportunities in medical imaging.	0.42161543802606605
However, while the basic principles of spiral CT still apply, we are now challenged to rethink our strategies in planning a CT study to take full advantage of the increased capabilities of MDCT.	0.7085988717911768
Extracorporeal photophoresis (ECP), a therapeutic modality that has been under investigation for some years, is based on separation of a leucocyte/lymphocyte-enriched cell fraction from the peripheral blood, extracorporeal treatment of the cells with 8-MOP/UVA and subsequent reinfusion of the cells in the patient.	0.7166372702265161
Its main effects seem to consist in changes to the immunologic behaviour of the photoinactivated/modulated cells.	0.3751726667713251
The immune response of the host is obviously stimulated by this treatment.	0.497662120733544
ECP is normally performed for 4 h per day on 2 consecutive days every 4 weeks.	0.4566381479116277
The treatment is well tolerated and causes few side effects.	0.6184003328446521
In our department, 1210 ECP treatments were administered to 41 patients between 1990 and 1994 and a preliminary evaluation was performed.	0.5683994564765679
These patients included 21 with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), 10 with progressive systemic scleroderma, 4 with chronic graft-versus-host disease and 1 each with pemphigus vulgaris, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, lupus erythematosus and cutaneous mucinosis.	0.5371074233963561
Patients with erythroderma and preserved immunocompetence achieved the best responses of all patients with CTCL.	0.5756128218006743
A treatment combining ECP with rlFN-, PUVA and/or radiation was also successful in patients with tumour-stage CTCL and lymph node involvement.	0.5207395683710971
Progressive systemic scleroderma responded in more than 50% of our cases.	0.7238201415108436
Treatment results were impressive in 4 patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease presenting with sclerodermatous and lichenoid changes of the skin and mucous membranes.	0.651233607090352
A clear improvement was also observed in the patient with pemphigus vulgaris refractory to standard therapies and in another patient with scleromyxoedema (Arndt-Gottron syndrome).	0.689730867146749
The effectiveness of ECP seems to be quite well established in CTCL, but remains to be examined in autoimmune dermatoses.	0.6436199218744271
ECP is an attractive addition to the dermatological therapies available but our experience is still preliminary.	0.46851383378017925
Opportunistic infections after long-term treatment with azathioprine (AZA) have not been noted in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG).	0.6368488084185311
We report on a 56-year-old woman with generalized MG who presented with cytomegalovirus infection after being treated with AZA for 17 years.	0.5211154018238736
The indication for immunosuppressive treatment in MG should be regularly reconfirmed, particularly since at least 50% of patients can discontinue AZA after two to four years without risk of exacerbation.	0.6607348909664537
Failure to find the gallbladder at the usual or most common atypical sites during surgery for cholecystolithiasis is a rare but known problem.	0.5893580667537405
Although ultrasonography has 95 % sensitivity for the diagnosis of cholelithiasis, occasionally a small contracted gallbladder with stones and chronic cholecystitis will be difficult to visualize and can lead to erroneous interpretation.	0.48423923452883044
We report on the case of a patient presenting with abdominal colic and ultrasonographically confirmed cholecystolithiasis.	0.6756981023496943
During laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the gallbladder could not be detected.	0.5517324632970931
After laparoscopic staging followed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and abdominal computed tomography, agenesis of the gallbladder was confirmed.	0.38962019762209604
This method can be considered for diagnosis of gallbladder agenesis without the need for laparotomy and thorough exploration.	0.5890921965547168

Malignant melanoma is the most important differential diagnosis in both clinical and histologic examination of melanocytic nevi.	0.7768251548243927
UV exposure with an erythemagenic dose and mechanical irritation of melanocytic nevi are able to induce reversible morphologic changes which simulate malignant melanoma.	0.3919348636572075
These changes are associated with an increased expression of HMB-45 antigen.	0.6595133851801595
In addition, an increased proliferation and repair activity is observed after UV exposure.	0.5639658480618496
The increased number of melanocytes located in suprabasal layers of the epidermis is accompanied by a change in keratinocyte adhesion molecule expression.	0.5133157427275717
The UV light is also able to influence the adhesive properties of melanocytes in vitro.	0.357734462317574
Therefore, both keratinocyte-derived factors and direct influence of UV on the melanocyte system are probably responsible for the morphologic changes.	0.5475179356814368
While these exogenously evoked changes are reversible, the potential biologic relevance - especially a possible role in the initiation of the carcinogenesis cascade - reguires clarification.	0.6702446901390022

For several years it has been argued that a chest tube should be placed at the scene of an accident if thoracic trauma is suspected.	0.607001803880408
However, during emergency treatment in hospital it has been observed that a high number of such tubes have been placed incorrectly.	0.6879736023902018
To validate this impression, we conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical course of 33 trauma victims who had had chest tubes placed at the scene of accident.	0.7842338683188442
It was found that 39.4% of the chest tubes were placed completey incorrectly and 21.2% required some correction; 39.4% were placed correctly.	0.6791812739101315

We could also estimate the participation of screening and the used methods in the Munich region.	0.5311419433519069
If the mammographies carried out today were used at 2-year intervals for women aged between 50 and 70 years, then the mammography screening could be performed with no additional costs for 70% of the women.	0.7038799350677761
The known facts regarding the population-based mortality and regarding the acceptance of the palpation screening and frequency of mammography are additional aspects for inclusion in the discussion of what research projects in Germany are and what they should fulfill.	0.5162875018855936
Insufficiency after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is a typical complication.	0.3871728372380825
Between 1 January 1992 and 31 December 1997 a total of 604 operations at the ACL were performed in the traumatology department of Nuremberg hospital.	0.5948863736992923
During the same period 48 "transplant failures" were treated.	0.7060284494262606
There were various reasons for the failure of the transplant, some of them technical, occurring during the operation or during aftercare.	0.7123620776335516
Another reason for a re-rupture of the transplant was by trauma.The different reasons for the failure of the transplant were analysed in our patient population.	0.674527933389086
The 48 patients were classified into five groups depending on the primary operation and the means of treatment (I = ACL sutures, II = artificial ligament, III = semitendinosus tendon, IV and V = ipsi- or contralateral bone-patellar-bone graft harvest after ACL reconstruction), so that the different ways of treatment were better comparable.	0.6906053767337474
Of the 48 patients 36 were followed up over an average of 2 1/2 years using the Lysholm scores and the OAK scores.	0.6633208478426302
The total score of the 36 patients was 81 points and can be valued as good using the evaluation scale of Lysholm and Gillquist.	0.5020490541690692
Using the OAK score we found an average of 71 to 81 points in the different groups; results in the group with the ipsilateral bone-tendon-bone graft harvest after ACL reconstruction were the worst.	0.6919676071165869
The totalscore using the OAK score was 74 points and was considered "moderate".	0.3731575263755963
The score results were discussed and compared with the current literature.	0.5682466246381196
In this case report, we focus on the importance of scurvy as a differential diagnosis in a newborn presenting with swollen legs.	0.6787911319983512
Scurvy is rare in highly developed countries and often overlooked.	0.421978831501662
Medical history, clinical symptoms and radiological findings are crucial for diagnosis.	0.7364181067633968
The diagnosis is confirmed by successful treatment with ascorbic acid.	0.5219472405668828
Hemangiomas of the skull base are rare neoplasms and are easily misdiagnosed as acoustic neuromas when occurring in the internal auditory canal.	0.5773928704495267
Among these tumors, ossifying hemangiomas are characterized histologically be newly formed bone tissue within their substance.	0.32892585363175203
We describe a 26-year old female patient who presented with left-sided sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus.	0.7532385164658671
T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a bright space-occupying lesion of the internal auditory canal with extension to the geniculate ganglion.	0.5306550485452367
Bony erosions of the internal auditory canal were proved by high-resolution computed tomography.	0.5862912475994749
A hemangioma was suspected preoperatively and was resected via a middle cranial fossa approach.	0.40961775371909237
Histologically, new bone formations were found in a cavernous hemangioma.	0.788050295375174
In general, radiologic findings can suggest a hemangioma of the internal auditory canal and help to differentiate it from acoustic neuroma.	0.477542559981666
Based on the histological findings of intratumoral bone formation, the hemangioma in our patient was classified as an ossifying hemangioma.	0.7224438834401394
However, reactive bone formation at the borders of a tumor in the internal auditory canal can also be mistaken as new intratumoral bone formation.	0.6194521725946115
Myocardial ischemia results in myocardial dysfunction.	0.31134621524404305
Recovery may be delayed ("stunning"), or persistent if perfusion remains reduced ("hibernation") and ischemia may go on to necrosis, thus, contributing to chronic heart failure.	0.63067998690338
In addition, myocardium not directly affected by ischemia may undergo adaptive processes like hypertrophy and dilatation, which may result in chronic left heart failure.	0.5916982570683877
This process is characterized by hemodynamic, neurohumoral, and progressive morphologic changes of the heart which are closely interrelated.	0.6459055164210856
Hemodynamic changes basically consist of an increase in left ventricular filling pressure and a decrease in global ejection fraction, and, in most cases years after myocardial infarction, in an increase in systemic vascular resistance and right atrial pressure.	0.7257768709179577
Neurohumoral changes consist of an increase in plasma catecholamines, atrial natriuretic factor and vasopressin, and in an activation of the renin-angiotensin-system.	0.6828134146103991
Plasma endothelin-1 was recently reported to be increased in patients with heart failure, and prognosis was related to endothelin levels.	0.6148399305036218
Diminished response of vessels to endothelium (EDRF/NO) dependent vasodilatation suggests impairment of vascular endothelium in heart failure.	0.4170036705915237
Local changes of cardiac neurohumoral systems could contribute to structural changes of the heart, e.g., systemic activation to hemodynamic changes.	0.5921437369382404
Structural changes of the heart are characterized by an increase in volume and thickness of surviving myocardium and an expansion of ischemic and necrotic myocardium.	0.6324494663016413
Molecular control of these processes which include various cell types, such as cardiomyocytes and cardiofibroblasts, are currently an issue of intense research and could result in specific therapeutic importance.	0.5005191731459723
Postoperative infection in the locomotor system may lead to malpractice suits.	0.4191917594501881
The aim of the study was to determine the success rate of these claims and the type of expert-confirmed medical negligence so that strategies for avoiding such negligence can be offered.	0.5895490808732213
A total of 261 decrees concerning suspected malpractice after postoperative infection in the locomotor system were retrospectively evaluated.	0.399133028294581
Of these, 43.7 % claims were successful.	0.5552707911721916
The most frequent type of negligence was late diagnosis (34.2 %), followed by inconsistant treatment (27.2 %) and insufficient surgical revision (5.3 %).	0.7305146251646627
In 33.3 %, combined types of negligence were found.	0.5629752560103429
Most frequently, negligence was suspected after infection following hand surgery and internal fixation of long bones.	0.5434379335940323
The highest success rate of claims was seen after puncture of joints (69.2 %).	0.5798904953513587
Insufficient documentation was confirmed in 15.3 %.	0.4620525486281149
The majority of negligence resulted from diagnostic and therapeutic doubts, which could be avoided, e. g., by a clear definition of infection, consultation of a second opinion, a 2nd-look operation, undelayed and radical surgical revision, painstaking follow-up and disciplined documentation.	0.6878701214185682
Abstract   Patient satisfaction plays an increasing part in the analysis of the outcome of medical treatment.	0.7949830401966004
The aim of the study was to compare health-related quality of life in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm after endovascular or conventional surgery.	0.7561056559738011
A total of 40 patients were included (20 treated by endovascular and 20 by conventional surgery).	0.7257174398342142
A questionnaire with 28 items similar to the SF-36 was answered during scheduled appointments.	0.4783172632665348
On the third postoperative day, the conventionally treated patients were more frequently confined to bed (80% vs. 32%) and complained of intervention-related pain (90% vs. 42%) and incisional pain (26% vs. 15%); 55% of the patients suffered from obstipation (vs. 5% of the endovascular group).	0.7331601161843093
Furthermore, the preoperative psychological stress seemed to be intensified.	0.6269565021921555
In comparable percentage, both the endovascular and conventionally treated patients were limited in social activities perioperatively.	0.5307014970084822
Sexual dysfunction was more frequent in the conventional group (33% vs. 13% three months postoperative).	0.6494846908651218
In addition, the conventionally treated patients were more limited in their physical activities (25% vs. 40%) and had more fear of ambulation (35% vs. 6%).	0.6441224034133995
The patients treated by an endovascular approach complained about frequent examinations (39% vs. 5%) that were often related to X-ray exposure (67% vs. 20%).	0.6838377836348005
All of the conventionally operated patients had a sense of improvement (vs. 89% of the endovascular group); nevertheless only 28% felt completely healthy, compared to 11% of the endovascular treated patients.	0.68264990142817
Advantages of the endovascular treated patients were "short hospital stay", "decreased pain", "smaller scars", and a "shorter confinement to bed".	0.781025468289527
After intervention the conventionally treated patients were more limited in almost all quality-of-life aspects.	0.5255519260461669
After 3 months, differences between the groups decreased except for sexual dysfunction and limited physical activities.	0.5919625786540855
The patients treated by endovascular surgery complained more about frequent X-ray examinations than the conventionally treated group.	0.5539904943543927
In the majority of ventilated patients endotracheal intubation is required only for a short time period.	0.5155097583634964
However, about 20% of the patients require prolonged mechanical ventilation.	0.7424869053699706
Apart from dysfunction of the central nervous system with a reduced respiratory drive, the vast majority of patients being difficult to wean suffer from either an increased load or a decreased capacity of their respiratory muscles.	0.5673388133884971
Furthermore, beside compromised respiratory mechanics other causes of difficult weaning are, e.g., left heart failure, inadequate sedation, neuropsychiatric issues, malnutrition and aspiration.	0.4903440591241879
The mere application of a consistent weaning strategy (independent from its concrete content) leads to an improved success rate.	0.47505719974454896
In this article three essential aspects of a weaning strategy are dealt with: 1) The concept of interventions (in particular focusing on mechanical ventilation modes unloading respiratory muscles), 2) pathophysiologically based parameters to predict weaning success or failure and 3) organisation of the T-tube trials.	0.5982037121868651
A new approach in weaning of long-term ventilated patients is non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NMV).	0.5981510190467465
Compared to invasive mechanical ventilation NMV aims at reducing weaning time, decreasing complication rate and improving prognosis.	0.43810572627898986
Finally, the last section addresses terminal weaning.	0.5045617277637378
The psychoanalytic cure is characterized by a basic antinomy of time and time-lessness.	0.5548615423974952
Freud based the daily psychoanalytic work on the order of the mechanic clock (the time of the machine) to regulate a relationship which is unique in our culture.	0.6661221140009612
The temporal order of the cure responds to the logic of the temporal path.	0.4755136791399883
On the opposite, in the world of the unconscious the familiar concepts of cause and effect as well as of before and after are abolished.	0.7230612347510733
"Symmetrical madness" prevails (Matte Blanco).	0.23015724966517773
The temporal core of the analytic situation is bi-logical.	0.4360288249929514
This ambiguity is reflected in the technical principles.	0.3871587359500935
Free association breaks through the logic of the temporal path, again and again.	0.48373678612654547
There are, however, different defence strategies defusing its unforeseeability.	0.42232539250963724
The tension between the time that determines the analytic setting and the timelessness of free association gets once again a process of temporal order going.	0.4161889772009864
Present social changes and in connection with them the changed time strategies endanger the temporal order of the analytic cure.	0.441368292409117
Several historical reports focusing on the heredity of migraine, as well as recent studies on its epidemiology and molecular biology, have revealed evidence for a decisive role of genetic factors in the aetiopathogenesis of familial migraine.	0.6535238411157533
Indeed, family studies, segregation analyses and twin studies have shown that genetic factors play an important role in disposition towards migraine but could not explain the entire aetiopathogenesis.	0.5184101522258856
The influence of extragenetic factors, however, remains mostly unknown.	0.43594041473885825
Recent linkage analyses have provided evidence for genetic heterogeneity.	0.37510273805602445
A locus for Familial Hemiplegic Migraine (FHM), the only known type of migraine that follows autosomal-dominant transmission, has been linked to chromosome 19p13 but genetic heterogeneity has also been shown, i. e. different types of migraine could be excluded from this locus.	0.5937578740171231
Further investigations should concentrate on identifying the FHM gene on chromosome 19p13, on linkage analyses with markers for different susceptibility genes, and on genomic analyses of highly informative pedigrees.	0.5667685028059176
This would lead to further clues to the pathogenesis underlying migraine and, thus, to therapeutic developments.	0.6754803716001954
Radiographic findings suggestive of osteopenia and osteoporosis are frequently encountered in daily medical practice and can result from a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from highly prevalent causes such as postmenopausal and involutional osteoporosis to very rare endocrinologic and hereditary or acquired disorders.	0.42391647521397713
As bone mass is lost, changes in the trabecular and cortical bone structure occur.	0.520906530537303
The changes that are visible on conventional radiographs may give specific information on the etiology of the underlying disease.	0.6765604021917894
Even though conventional radiography is indispensable in the differential diagnosis of osteopenia and osteoporosis, visual assessment of bone mass and its changes is subjective and strongly depends on the radiographic technique.	0.5939880659742736
With radiogrammetry and radiographic absorptiometry two methods exist that rely on conventional radiography and allow for a quantification of bone mass.	0.4286973325269066
This article describes the author's experience during the 1-year AGA Pittsburgh fellowship from 1 April 1996 to 31 March 1997.	0.5790977640439167
The article is focused on the work in the Musculoskeletal Research Center and the Center for Sports Medicine of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery in Pittsburgh.	0.5573328208323511
The author describes projects on the biomechanics of the cruciate ligaments, using robotic technology.	0.5277675177563501
Organizational and social aspects of the life in Pittsburgh are discussed.	0.5151550129111679
The different subgroups of hypercalciuria cannot be separated clearly by the Pak calcium-load test.	0.30351827527902003
To improve the diagnosis and therapy we examined all relevant parameters of calcium metabolism in 32 patients with calcium urolithiasis and hypercalciuria (> 6.25 mmol/day).	0.7785390324426591
We also conducted bone mineral density measurements as well as the Pak calcium-load test.	0.40160910794061483
In most cases the pathophysiological constellations which Pak takes as the basis for his classification of hypercalciuria could not be shown.	0.6740456102581712
To date, diagnostics only insufficiently explains the genesis of hypercalciuria (except pHPT).	0.3735956218057421
As a consequence, a therapeutic problem arises: a low-calcium diet should not be generally recommended, since some patients may develop osteopenia.	0.7325920360724271
From our investigation the following diagnostic and therapeutic conclusions can be drawn: (1) Hypercalciuria in primary hyperparathyroidism should be treated by surgical removal of the adenoma.	0.724424036833204
(2) The parathormone-independent osteogenic form should be treated with thiazides.	0.6534040426054905
(3) Hypercalciuria with increased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D should be treated by low-calcium diet.	0.5658413302297061
A 58-year old man with wilson's disease sustained a bilateral spontaneous rupture of the quadriceps tendon.	0.6112697442762687
The histological investigation showed advanced degeneration of tendon structure and cupper deposits.	0.3422106320952244
After tenosuture the patient had complete cure with full range of movement.	0.5059292156734584
We discuss about relation of wilson x s disease, cupper deposits and degenerative changes of tendon tissue.	0.4028345631651403
Within the framework of the National Health Interview and Examination Survey 1998 the Short Form Questionnaire SF-36 has been applied to measure the health related quality of life (HRQOL).	0.5095111665326857
This opened more opportunities than simply creating a new normative sample for the German adult population.	0.3863423714945918
Thus, the very complex interdependence between morbidity, satisfaction, risk factors, health related behaviours, social status, age and sex on the one side and the subjective assessment of health related quality of life on the other hand may be investigated.	0.7082951310313957
First results of the Survey data are presented which open the discussion of the possibilities and limits of the SF-36 instrument for measuring health related quality of life at the population level.	0.6378473308962415
The von Willebrand's Disease affects about 1-3 % of the population and it is undiagnosed in most people.	0.6917386735604456
Originally described by the Finish physician Erik von Willebrand in 1926 this disorder is associated with mucous membran bleeding including epistaxis, hypermenorhoea and excessive bleeding from surgery and dental procedures.	0.3712255690921762
In von Willebrands disease the patients have a quantitative or qualitative abnormality in the von Willebrand Factor (vWF) which has two major functions: it serves by bridging between platelets and injury site in the blood vessel wall, and it circulates as a complex with factor VIII, protecting it from rapid degradation.	0.6396068808755815
More than 20 different types and subtypes of vWD have been described but almost all patients can be classified as having 1 of the 2 most common types of vWD.	0.7024447548063998
About 70 % of patients have type 1 and about 10-20 % present themself with type 2A and 2B vWD type 3 in about 10 %.	0.647772609452703
By taking a clinical history of bleeding it is important to think about vWD and to make the appropriate diagnosis.	0.626645844759705
If the vWD is suspected diagnostic tests should include an activated partial thromboplastin time, bleeding time, factor VIII:C, Ristocetin cofactor, and vWF antigen.	0.44438393334120596
Additional testing of ristocetin induced plattlet adhesion (RIPA), the multimeric structure and collagen binding test and gen-analysis allow diagnosing the different types of v. Willebrand Disease.	0.44937957087977753
The treatment of choice in mild forms is the synthetic agent desmopressin.	0.6287515341161343
In patients with severe type 1, type 2B, 2N and type 3 or in people who do not response to desmopressin, the appropriate treatment is a factor VIII concentrate that is rich of vWF.	0.6471856056919767
Until now no recommendations in the orthopaedic literature have been found regarding diagnosis and treatment of vWS patients.	0.5736974476168994
Based on the experience with 43 orthopaedic patients presenting vWD over the last 15 years a contemporary guideline for the successful perioperative management of vWD in orthopaedic surgery is presented.	0.5500502005355572
In a close collaboration between the orthopaedic surgeon and the specialized haemostaseologist every invasive procedure in patients with vWD can be undertaken without the risk of excessive bleeding.	0.4933816181131454
Patients with a prior myocardial infarction (MI) have a high risk of perioperative reinfarction compared with the normal population (5%-8% vs. 0.1%-0.7%) [10].	0.9479392835601188
According to Rao [13], a reduction of this risk is possible when patients are monitored invasively and all haemodynamic parameters are kept within the physiological range.	0.580854126082821
In most institutions it is not feasible to treat patients as Rao recommended: this would overstrain both hospital structure and financial resources.	0.6192516504347116
We studied the incidence of perioperative MI and other cardiac events in patients with prior MI.	0.5669744774056464
During the study period the anaesthesia and intensive care methods of our institution were neither changed nor influenced.	0.48054718090429316
In addition to this clinical evaluation, we performed perioperative Holter electrocardiographic monitoring and measured serum levels of the recently introduced marker troponin T (parts II and III).	0.6514487069814692
Small basal cell carcinomas of the trunk are usually regarded as relatively harmless.	0.5525493062311675
In contrast, large and ulcerating basal cell carcinomas may become a therapeutic challenge with a less favourable prognosis and high risk of recurrence.	0.6488091885745644
The development of mutilating giant basal cell carcinomas appears less due to the biological aggressive character of the tumors, but rather to the patients' attitude of neglect.	0.7291142006171218
The case of a 62-year-old patient, featuring such attitude, demonstrates how a common basal cell carcinoma of the trunk can grow over a period of years to a troublesome ulcerating tumor.	0.5490778294883201
This epidemiologic, retrospective follow-up mortality study is based on the data gathered in the department of forensic medicine at the University Hospital of Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt/Main.	0.577409541148958
