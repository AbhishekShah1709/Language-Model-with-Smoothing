This effect is related to some additional direct cerebral vasodilating potency of racemic ketamine based on a mechanism involving blockade of Ca++ channels.	0.4921333616335455
The effects of racemic ketamine on CBF autoregulation have not been investigated systematically.	0.5506805054005642
However, studies in rats have shown that CBF autoregulation was maintained with low- and high-dose S(+)-ketamine.	0.8219993602038164
Infusion of racemic ketamine alters intracranial volume and ICP.	0.4050562485492515
Studies in spontaneously ventilating pigs with and without intracranial hypertension have shown that racemic ketamine (0.5-5.0 mg/kg) produces increases in PaCO2 and ICP.	0.6490770621191815
In contrast, identical experiments with mechanical ventilation and controlled PaCO2 showed no changes in ICP following racemic ketamine infusion.	0.42518141879218324
This implies that increases in ICP are related to inadequate ventilation with consecutive hypercapnia and increases in intracranial blood volume.	0.41797279006282423
However, mechanical ventilation may not be sufficient to control ICP following racemic ketamine.	0.5926690077396047
Experiments in mechanically ventilated dogs indicate that racemic ketamine (2 mg/kg) increases cerebral blood volume and ICP even in the presence of normoventilation, a response that is reversible by hyperventilation or the administration of diazepam.	0.6415850005265727
Studies in patients have shown that racemic ketamine (2.0 mg/kg) reduces CBF in the presence of cerebral vasodilators like halothane or N2O.	0.56656375784912
In contrast, studies in unanaesthetised humans showed increases in CBF after racemic ketamine (2-3 mg/kg).	0.6067576992376368
This observation is consistent with animal studies and suggests that the cerebrovascular effects of racemic ketamine are related to the pre-existing cerebrovascular tone induced by background anaesthetics.	0.41030285209909595
Dengue-Fever is a mosquito transmitted viral disease.	0.20468462111235547
It is endemic mainly in South-East Asia and Afrika.	0.2926358964323319
The clinical manifestation is divided into different stages.	0.33946948605783056
Ocular manifestations in travellers have been rarely reported.	0.2629386548170042
Sufficient and regular wetting of the cornea with a normal preocular tear film is an essential requirement for the accurate visual functioning of the eye.	0.566361334191479
Multiple factors may cause tear film instability.	0.3152998320940327
Measuring the break-up time of the preocular tear film is a necessary, clinically reliable means for evaluating tear film stability.	0.5765384337635672
We designed a new instrument to observe the preocular tear film at high magnification which can contribute to the in vivo imaging of the physiological and pathophysiological dynamics of the tear film and its break-up phenomena.	0.55181510428613
The prevalence of hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV infections among drug abuse-related fatalities in Hamburg (1985-1997) was investigated with respect to epidemiological, forensic and morphological aspects.	0.6477025974485298
The purpose of this study was (1) to determine the prevalence of hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV infections among drug abuse-related fatalities (drug deaths) in Hamburg from 1985 to 1997, (2) to assess the rate of multiple infections and (3) to analyze the liver histomorphology in 100 autopsied drug deaths.	0.7332751650999444
Furthermore, we discuss the epidemiological and forensic aspects.	0.814880494951458
In this period 1469 drug deaths were registered with a prevalence for HBV of 35% (1997: 39%), for HCV 51% (1997: 58%), and for HIV 7% (1997: 15%).	0.6789849603342785
Co-infections were common (28%) and 19% of all cases were infected with HBV and HCV.	0.8553591863619059
The liver histology showed that hepatitis was frequently diagnosed (74%) and was associated with HBV and/or HCV infections (77% of all hepatitis cases).	0.7216089650577947
Only 9% showed a normal liverhistology.	0.8178404585030093
Forensic autopsies and monitoring of HBV, HCV and HIV infections in drug deaths represent an important tool to gain information about the individual case and the situation among i.v.	0.5939037007747002
Background: An abnormal coronary flow reserve represents an early marker of impaired blood flow regulation in the natural history of coronary atherosclerosis under the impact of risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia.	0.6480352021207665
Our clinical investigation was aimed at assessing noninvasively the integrative coronary flow response to dipyridamole stress in 18 consecutive patients with microvascular angina, only moderately elevated LDL-cholesterol levels (168 +/- 33 mg/dl), and reduced vasodilator capacity despite normal (n=9) or slightly abnormal (n=9) coronary arteriograms (minimal disease with luminal irregularities and/or diameter reduction <=30%) before and after 6-month lipid-lowering therapy (simvastatin).	0.5768050977014565
Methods: Regional and averaged myocardial blood flow were measured at rest and after dipyridamole induced vasodilation (0.56 mg/kg) using dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and N-13 ammonia as flow tracer related to a 3-compartment kinetic model.	0.5978710479583256
Baseline data (mean +/- SD): 13 males, 5 females; mean age: 56 +/- 8 years; basal coronary flow: 90 +/- 22 ml/minx100 g; after lipid intervention: 93 +/- 18 ml/minx100 g (n.s.).	0.6739035185456567
Total cholesterol decreased to 170 +/- 36 mg/dl (p<0.001); mean LDL level: 97 +/- 26 mg/dl (p<0.001).	0.5279600069877725
Coronary dilator capacity increased, assessed in terms of minimal coronary resistance: 0.38 +/- 0.08 vs 0.49 +/- 0.09 units at baseline (p<0.01), myocardial blood flow under dipyridamole: 232 +/- 43 vs 186 +/- 37 ml/minx100 g at baseline (p<0.01), and instantaneous flow ratio: 2.6 +/- 0.7 vs 2.2 +/- 0.6 (p=0.06).	0.5873295763406766
Concomitantly, a considerable regression of angina was noticed in the majority of patients.	0.5917350758415549
Conclusions: An improvement of the non-invasively determined integrative dipyridamole induced coronary vasodilator capacity may be achieved after 6 months by intensive lipid lowering at a very early stage of coronary atherosclerosis.	0.6068883759191527
Consequently, aggressive cholesterol-lowering therapy represents an antiischemic and antianginal approach suggesting, at least in part, functional reversal and probably prevention of further disease progression.	0.5417611864548935
We report the case of a a 60 year-old worker in the pharmaceutical industry who suffered from recurring contact dermatitis.	0.5212582527817639
Initially the contact dermatitis was limited to the hands; later on it became generalized.	0.5091160949790771
The patient had been working on a drug filling line in a pharmaceutical plant for more than 20 years.	0.5841003688656992
Eight years after starting this job he had developed allergic hand dermatitis to 2,6-diaminopyridine (patch test positive); this healed upon cessation of exposure.	0.42064526665123053
Ten years later he again developed hand dermatitis which progressed to generalized dermatitis and conjunctivitis.	0.3586021495740277
Under systemic and local therapy with corticosteroids and cessation of work, it healed nearly completly.	0.5704344242418785
Four months after returning to work, the patient experienced a first episode of severe asthma and generalized dermatitis with conjunctivitis following exposure to hydroxychloroquine the day before.	0.6138213454883352
The asthma and dermatitis improved after systemic corticosteroid therapy and stopping work.	0.2866568018818797
His condition continued to fluctuate, when though the patient was transferred at work and now wore rubber gloves.	0.5767961393245802
Eight months later he again developed a generalized dermatitis.	0.4001647708997435
Patch testing revealed delayed-type sensitizations to hydroxychloroquine (tested in concentrations of 0.1%, 0.5%, 1% and 2%).	0.708504140310182
Equivalent tests in five healthy volunteers were negative.	0.28766576416921474
The patch test reactions were pustular, while a biopsy was interpreted as a multiform contact dermatitis reaction.	0.5534963853962213
Bronchial exposure with hydroxychloroquine dust produced a delayed bronchial obstruction over the next 20 hours, which progressed to fever and generalized erythema (hematogenous contact dermatitis).	0.4979677000298228
After removing exposure to 2,6-diaminopyridine and hydroxychloroquine, the patient went on to develop a contact dermatitis to latex (patch test positive).	0.6114155047673614
However, skin prick tests with latex and patch tests with rubber additiva were negative.	0.4483127219508953
Hydroxychloroquine is well known to cause drug reactions.	0.5880971470854437
To our knowledge, contact dermatitis to this substance has not yet been reported.	0.49345131932036085
It is noteworthy that the patch test reactions were pustular and of multiform morphology and that bronchial exposure to the allergen resulted in asthma and a generalized drug reaction.	0.455939787532651
Pathogenetically the asthmatic reaction seems to be on a delayed-type mechanism as is also seen with ampicillin, cobalt and nickel induced asthma.	0.4581183274586059
A 45 years old female runner developed a bilateral tendinopathy of the Achilles tendon after repeated antimicrobiotical treatment with ciprofloxacin.	0.4223980373307664
One month later the right Achilles tendon ruptured without any sudden pain.	0.3365344428383272
MRI revealed degenerative changes of the left Achilles tendon; on the right side the tendon was ruptured with a dehiscence of 4 cm between both ends of the tendon.	0.7505109415557124
The tendon was reconstructed surgically.	0.3787300282524469
The histological analysis showed cystic changes with focal necrosis.	0.3577096718049508
This finding differ from findings in non drug induced tendinopathies.	0.32280758778282553
After antimicrobiotical treatment with ciprofloxacin the side effect of a tendon disorder must be considered.	0.5373337403419524
The impairment of the tendon may be as strong that a tendon rupture may occur at daily living activities without any typical clinical symptoms.	0.5761890912224263
The recent results obtained from investigations based on molecular biological techniques have led to a better understanding of recurrent genetic causes important for the pathogenesis of tumors.	0.5658978532543556
Several genes have been identified as being involved in the development of cancer.	0.6100438992102247
In many cases, the activation of oncogenes or the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes is the predominant reason for cancerogenic cell transformation.	0.6066424506948439
Functional dysregulation is frequently the consequence of mutations, resulting in an alteration of the primary structure of the DNA.	0.6356976598081722
As our understanding of the nature, function, and interaction of these genes evolves, new opportunities for early diagnosis, classification, prevention, and treatment of malignant tumors will arise.	0.8105098265943915
The present report summarizes the current molecular biological aspects of several oncogenes (erbB, ras, myc, raf, fos, jun, bcl, mdm 2, myb, kit CSF1R, met) and tumor suppressor genes (p 53, rb, mts) involved in lung-cancer development with respect to the pathology of lung tumors, including the importance of these genes as far as the clinical course of the disease is concerned.	0.6962692647869877
Hyperbaric Oxygen (HBO) therapy is a kind of medical treatment in which a patient breathes 100% of oxygen inside a pressure chamber while the pressure of the chamber is increased to a point higher than sea level pressure.	0.7065876689063417
It is strongly based on clearly defined physical laws and physiological regularities.	0.3215440688951751
For the clinical use of HBO therapy, according to international recommendations, there are several commonly accepted indications in which HBO either is the only causative life-saving kind of treatment, or is an essential and oftenly decisive component of a comprehensive interdisciplinary intensive care therapy.	0.6822655326604179
Among potential adverse effects, barotrauma of the lungs and especially oxygen toxicity to the central nervous system have to be mentioned.	0.5460469832364591
Clinical use of HBO therefore requires special knowledge of its effects, risks, and adverse effects, a clear and distinct indication, and the ability and skills to keep complications under control by means of intensive care or emergency medical measures.	0.6821143665079626
The clinical use of hyperbaric oxygen with its interdisciplinary-like character of emergency medicine or intensive care therapy therefore should be an additional, most interesting field of activity for the anaesthesiologist.	0.6546363516144394
Although arthroscopy of the ankle joint has been well established, there are only very few reports about arthroscopy in ankle fracture treatment.	0.7133866268546565
In order to sytematically analyze the intraarticular lesions of ankle fractures, we assessed 196 consecutive ankle fractures immediately before ORIF.	0.5332243947385986
There were 94 male and 101 female patients with an average age of 47.8 years (16-88 years).	0.7006118911015362
There were more cartilage lesions found than expected, and cartilage lesions were not noted more frequently in type C-fractures than in type B-fractures.	0.694390211278182
In both fracture types, an increasing amount of cartilage lesions was found from group 1 to 3.	0.6361470719604713
In addition, more ligament injuries were found than expected, especially in the B.1- and B.2-fractures.	0.8706388477276672
Successful arthroscopic surgery was performed in 26 cases: internal fixation, 9; loose body removal, 7; ligament reposition, 5; cartilage smoothening, 4; and cartilage fracture repair, 1.	0.6792795403357605
In one case, a periostal flap could not be reduced, and in another case, the internal fixation of the medial malleolus was not stable.	0.9429022283951339
In summary, arthroscopy was shown to be a very helpful diagnostic tool in ankle fractures.	0.7856054894121313
As long-term results are not yet available, it remains, however, unclear as to whether arthroscopy may improve the success of the following ORIF.	0.9287924301804064
Arthroscopy was also shown to be a successful tool for several closed surgical procedures.	0.5852914176130007
Of these, percutaneous internal fixation of the medial malleolus under arthroscopic view may be an excellent indication.	0.8123840179119775
Objective: Transcultural adaption of the two most widely used and accepted functional indices in ankylosing spondylitis, the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) and Dougados Functional Index (D-FI).	0.604261653721532
Methods: The instruments were translated and tested for internal consistency (Cronbach's coefficient alpha), test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC), construct validity (testing for association with Schober's test, finger floor distance, occiput wall distance, frequency and duration of awakenings at night, and a visual analog scale pain), and responsiveness (standardized response mean, SRM).	0.5179891746005773
Results: The study sample consisted of 72 patients of a randomized, controlled clinical trial receiving either Diclofenac or placebo.	0.6762973208523894
Visual assessment of distribution patterns revealed a ceiling effect of both instruments.	0.3700422636624791
Both questionnaires had a high internal consistency (Cronbach alpha: 0.81 [BASFI], 0.85 [D-FI] and a high test-retest reliability (ICC: 0.92 [BASFI], 0.89 [D-FI]).	0.5575899533215755
The limited responsiveness to Diclofenac treatment (SRM: 0.46 [BASFI],  0.33 [D-FI]) may be related to the selected study sample.	0.6336413767713123
The BASFI was significantly correlated with all tested validation parameters.	0.3434479350820959
The  D-FI was only significantly correlated with finger floor distance, occiput wall distance, and duration of awakenings at night.	0.482726268334531
Conclusion: The transculturally adapted version of both functional indices are valid, reliable, and internally consistent.	0.5746100306063541
Because of psychometric advantages, the BASFI may be preferred in clinical trial settings.	0.6090975700172324
The role of radiotherapy of the pelvic lymphatic pathways in patients with node positive prostate cancer remains uncertain.	0.608147673806637
Interpretation of the few prospective studies (RTOG 75-06 and 77-06) is hampered by severe flaws in the study design.	0.7068549740644128
Extension of the radiation to the paraaortal region shows no advantage over radiation of the pelvic lymphatics alone and is not warranted.	0.6338485294390838
Data on longterm side-effects are only available from older studies with outdated radiation techniques.	0.4873052687464579
According to more recent studies short term side effects are considerably higher with radiation of the pelvic lymphatics when compared with radiation of the prostate alone.	0.6851336573764564
In summary radiation of the lymphatic pathways in lymph node positive prostate cancer cannot currently be considered as standard treatment and should be carried out within clinical studies.	0.6084604955538209
In reconstruction of cartilage defects, autogenous transplantation is known as a reliable and experienced method.	0.5723415903122688
Although a clinical application has not been reported until now, tissue engineering permits in vitro production of autogenous cartilage transplants.	0.5698460978894804
Nevertheless, in both methods the cartilage is exposed to individually varying resorptive mechanisms.	0.6626702783674714
Among other methods for in vivo tissue protection, the encapsulation with a semipermeable polyelectrolytecomplex membrane could guarantee sufficient protection against resorptive influences.	0.5062682108523405
Human septal cartilage was encapsulated (group 1) with polyelectrolytecomplex membranes and subcutaneously implanted on the back of thymusaplastic nude mice.	0.5657225930790158
Cartilage implants without encapsulation (group 2) were used as control.	0.7581350337469471
Scanning electron microscopy and histochemical investigations were performed 1, 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks after implantation.	0.7385058777375906
Group 1 showed no signs of resorption and chronic inflammation at all.	0.45139985240598623
In contrast, group 2 presented, correlating to the time of implanta-tion, increasing signs of cell death and fibrotic transformation, representing an increased activity of resorption.	0.6270224036655598
In conclusion, tissue encapsulation with a polyelectrolytecomplex membrane could ensure a sufficient protection of human cartilage transplants from resorptive influences.	0.4696011340451268
For the plastic-reconstructive surgeon the desired result becomes more calculable.	0.39959107374890124
Subjective time-experience and objective time-estimation were examined in 20 endogenous, 20 neurotic depressives, and 15 healthy volunteers.	0.6871994188059252
Subjective experience of past and anticipated future time was more extended in both depressive groups than in healthy controls.	0.35543522613290945
Objective time estimation differed between depressives and controls concerning relatively long time spans whereas very short time spans were correctly estimated also by depressives.	0.35948007802400217
There were no significant differences between endogenous and neurotic depressives.	0.5671702246148431
The perception of extended time normalized during treatment.	0.2778336776954677
The depressives' time perception, differences correlated with the extent of depressive psychopathological symptoms and - to a lesser degree - with retardation.	0.7516726269912059
The findings support the hypotheses of anthropological phenomenology concerning disturbed time perception and estimation in depressives.	0.34133050997260916
Amelioration of experienced time-extension in intentionally structured time spans compared to empty time spans suggests psychotherapeutic consequences in the sense of Lewinsohn.	0.3092884894629811
We investigated whether the free-to-total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ratio (f-PSA/t-PSA ratio; i. e. percentage of free PSA) represents a better discriminator for the detection of cancer of the prostate (CaP).	0.5759126329962732
In a retrospective analysis, the persentage of free PSA was determined in the sera of 35 patients with histologically proven benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 35 patients with clinically localized CaP.	0.77726658200558
Patients with urolithiasis (n = 33) served as a control group.	0.4245452367775781
Serum levels of free PSA and total PSA were determined employing a chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay.	0.45669788905203157
Patients with CaP demonstrated a lower percentage of free PSA (median: 8.7) than patients with BPH (median: 20.0; P < 0.001) and those with urolithiasis (median: 18.8; P < 0.001).	0.6907924668785287
Determination of the percentage of free PSA enhances the differentiation between BPH and CaP and may reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies in patients with an elevated PSA.	0.6988312034571893
Confirmation of our preliminary results is required.	0.3172663730606505
Psychological problems in children and parents related to children's atopic eczema (AE) may impede the success of treatment.	0.6046037678335795
We studied the question, if behavior-based parental education in groups (DPE) or standardized video-education (VPE) could enhance dermatological treatment effects and reduce skin-damaging behaviors in children and stress in their mothers.	0.6075625669867619
Sevoflurane degrades in CO2 absorbents to produce compound A, which may have  hepatotoxic potential in humans.	0.6149817183896787
Several recent studies in human volunteers have been performed to evaluate this potential.	0.6133627264844713
Three studies have evaluated sevoflurane administered to volunteers using a 3% concentration for 8 h duration at approximately 2 L/min flow rate.	0.46623304557459827
The initial investigation found high excretion of protein, glucose and renal tubular enzymes in the urine of the volunteers receiving sevoflurane.	0.49975968452475333
Subsequent investigations using identical protocols found more minor or absent changes in excretion of these markers.	0.33006344002417953
One additional investigation in volunteers studied 3% sevoflurane anesthesia for 4 h duration using a low-flow (1 L/min) technique.	0.7432393109667331
No significant excretion of protein, glucose or renal enzymes was observed.	0.3781566230308999
Application of these results to clinical practice must be interpreted in light of the experimental nature of the anesthetic administration.	0.7370582486370809
Although some controversy remains, these data, combined with results of recent studies in surgical patients, suggest that renal function following modest duration low-flow sevoflurane anesthesia is similar to that following isoflurane anesthesia.	0.7263872044295794
Background: The microbial colonization of the intestinal tract in newborns begins during delivery.	0.5428853567047426
Streptococci and Escherichia coli pave the way for the bifidobacterial dominance typical in breast-fed newborns.	0.37549380635933516
They provide optimal living conditions for anaerobic bifidobacteria by withdrawal of intraluminal oxygen.	0.25979404062508454
A mixed intestinal flora is established on infant formula feeding in the infant.	0.330428034714418
Bifidobacteria, Bacteroides, Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci and lactobacilli are the main genera of this mixed intestinal flora.	0.43777482041430726
This represents an intermediate stage of the microflora in adults.	0.44151274054793005
The bifidogenic effect of mothers' milk is based on the active substances it contains, which selectively enhance the growth of bifidobacteria, whereas other active substances suppress the growth of the accompanying flora.	0.6830462860913699
Bifidus-enhancing factors in breast-feeding are lactose, oligosaccharides, glycoproteins such as glycomacropeptide and the inoculation with bifidobacteria deriving from the skin surface of the mother.	0.4847385955232212
Factors directed to the suppression of the accompanying microflora are antibodies, lactoferrin, lysozyme, fatty acids and monoglycerides that act as antimicrobial substances and the comparatively low protein and iron content in mothers' milk.	0.4077432506022543
A bifidus-inhibiting colonization of the intestinal tract with pathogenic germs is caused by maternal birth-canal infections, which are now known to be the most frequent reason for premature births.	0.7234519646160309
An increasing number of surgical deliveries, the separation of the newborn infant from its mother, and the generous use of antibiotics contribute to the delayed colonization of bifidobacteria and to the development of life-threatening nosocomial infections.	0.759882601601537
Counteractive measures against this disastrous situation are the preferential use of bifidobacteria-preserving antibiotics and the inoculation of lyophilized bifidobacteria.	0.3754373919519352
Between January 1983 and December 1987, metatarsal head-resections were performed on 203 patients, comprising a total of 370 feet, using the Hueter/Mayo and Hoffmann procedure.	0.543655287354922
Seventy-two patients, comprising a total of 126 feet, were available for post-operative review after an average of 11.4 years from the date of the original operations.	0.7690324519545808
The information obtained from standardized questionnaires was compared to the information found in each patient's file.	0.6225312765054511
In addition, every available pre- and post-operative x-ray taken from 1983 to 1987 was analyzed.	0.5444550443107722
Thus, with an average follow-up period of 5.6 years, the changes found in the pre- and post-operative x-rays from a total of 183 feet could be compared.	0.9097322980967303
Before the operations, nearly 100% of the examined feet suffered from painful synovial hypertrophy and erosion of the metatarsophalangeal joints with dislocation and subluxation, causing approximately 70% of all patients to have great difficulties in walking.	0.6307877017692812
After the operations, however, 90.2% of the patients reported that this condition had noticeably improved or had completely disappeared.	0.6802461020950122
In fact, 87.5% of all patients reported a lasting improvement in their ability to walk longer distances.	0.6824117013328276
As the main criteria in determining the success of an operation (namely, the noticeable reduction of pain and increased mobility) were achieved in 87.5% of the patients, we consider the metatarsal head-resection a reliable method of correcting forefoot deformities in rheumatoid arthritis.	0.8016228743899247
Bone metabolism is influenced by systemic and local acting hormons.	0.4224057276884004
Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) as representatives of the latter substances are known to have the ability for ectopic bone formation.	0.6992949272018514
Within this study, we investigated the influence of different growth factors on the proliferation- and differentiation rate of osteoblast-like cells.	0.8006584362959086
For that purpose, human osteoblast-like cells (HPOC) were incubated in the presence of either recombinant BMP-4 of the genome of xenopus laevis (rxBMP-4), recombinant human BMP 2 (rhBMP-2), transforming growth factor-ß (TGF-ß) or basic fibroblast growth factor (rh-bFGF) in two different concentrations each (10 ng/ml and 50 ng/ml).	0.6474674967083338
Cell proliferation was measured within a MTT [3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromid] assay, the amount of cell differentiation by the activity of alcaline phosphatase.	0.8475893833258167
Rx-BMP-4 induced a differentiation of HPOC to almost the same extent as rhBMP-2, whereas the addition of rh-bFGF, applied at the same concentration, failed to have any influence on cell differentiation.	0.6209381001328503
However, rh-bFGF provoked an increase in cell proliferation when compared with unstimulated HPOC, while rhBMP-2 and rxBMP-4 showed no effect on proliferation.	0.6122360742318653
TGF-ß influenced bone proliferation as well as differenciation significantly.	0.36816536551540807
The equipotent effect of recombinant human BMP-2 and recombinant BMP-4 obtained from Xenopus laevis with regard to differentiation and proliferation of human primary osteoblast-like cells originates either in the fact that target cells have receptors for BMP 2 as well as BMP 4, or that both BMP's link to the same receptor with almost the same affinity.	0.5571090555807678
Sonography has provided an important addition to the tools available for the diagnosis of the soft tissues in the head and neck region.	0.7203590886759911
The ENT surgeon himself is able to examine pathological formations by this quick, non-invasive and, last but not least, less expensive method.	0.5456500407398387
Due to the high resolution of the procedure the chance of detecting even small changes is increased and the exactness of diagnosis of pathological lymph nodes of the neck has been significantly improved compared to palpation alone.	0.6741313215309643
Ultrasound has replaced the sialographic procedures in the field of diagnostic evaluation of salivary gland disease in the daily practice except for special indications.	0.6264003983596447
After inauguration of color Doppler sonography non-invasive evaluation of vascular stenosis of the large cervical vessels concerning their hemodynamic effects has become possible.	0.5141545320708749
This issue is important for the differential dignosis of otoneurological diseases such as sudden hearing loss, vertigo and tinnitus.	0.46420739793934174
Additionally, the extent of perfusion of space-occupying lesions can be easily examined, and therefore the risk of mass bleeding can be preoperatively assessed by this method without harm to the patient.	0.6806025391010931
Especially carotid body tumors may be diagnosed with high accuracy by the evidence of significant diffuse perfusion of the lesion.	0.5703476701411349
In several studies the specificity of the assessment of cervical lymph node disease could be increased by examination of resistance indices.	0.6890729465736243
However, other authors have shown inconsistent results in differentiation of benign and malignant lumps; therefore, final judgment does not seem to be possible yet.	0.5857730716635849
Use of echo-contrast agents to enhance the ultrasound signal seems to be a promising approach for future developments in color Doppler imaging.	0.6076772163023836
Painful stiffness of the shoulder is an ill-defined clinical entity that is difficult to assess and delicate to treat.	0.5839886382426213
The nomenclature used is broad and includes terms such as frozen shoulder, adhesive capsulitis, focal algodystrophy, stiff shoulder, contracted shoulder, and others.	0.4556451681733006
Apart from its idiopathic form, the disease can be initiated by trauma, infection, tumour, radiation, systemic and local metabolic disturbances.	0.7529417731504019
Pathoanatomically, the common denominator is an inflammatory vascular proliferation followed by thickening, scarring, and retraction of the joint capsule.	0.5904948598534269
The inflammatory process often starts at the rotator interval and may extend to the subacromial space.	0.41643145720272134
The prognosis for patients in whom metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is not treated is unfavorable, with a reported 5-year survival of 0-18 %.	0.847456962985578
Before the era of immunotherapy and in the absence of effective nonsurgical therapy, resection of metastases was the accepted way to prolong survival, giving a 5-year survival of 7-69 %.	0.676247123176951
Retrospective studies have shown that several clinical factors are associated with a relatively good prognosis.	0.6027541916690574
Some patients will benefit from resection of metastases, but most patients with metastatic RCC are not candidates for such aggressive surgery.	0.6137379860016545
The use of interleukin-2 has demonstrated that immunotherapy can produce durable remissions.	0.45604642037791154
Without randomized trials, it is difficult to know whether survival is longer than that in untreated patients, but there is clear evidence that immunotherapy improves survival and yields long-lasting remissions in selected patients.	0.6830242297184932
Many questions remain concerning quality of life and the benefit-to-risk ratio of immunotherapy, but it is the most effective treatment for metastatic RCC.	0.8351051734505304
After loss of active glenohumeral motion the arm cannot be positioned in space and function is impaired.	0.40316229698681805
Fusion of the glenohumeral joint creates a new platform for the movement of elbow, hand and fingers and leads to an improvement of function.	0.5564291147348103
The use of the reconstructive plate makes the operation easier.	0.4849686610716233
Shoulder fusion is especially suited if the function of elbow and hand is well preserved and if the patient is physically active.	0.6331065360606578
But fusion is definite and the options of muscle transfer operations and above elbow amputation have to be considered.	0.46937731107137176
The unreamed femoral nail (UFN) system, with its numerous proximal interlocking options, allows a minimal invasive surgical procedure for the treatment of nearly all femoral fracture patterns.	0.6595186248328144
Sixty-six fractures, 5 cases of osteolysis or pathologic fractures, 2 limb shortenings and 1 lengthening (monorail technique) and 3 cases of pseudarthrosis were stabilised with the UFN from July 1994 to December 1996.	0.6781622986630338
The fractures were analysed according to the AO classification.	0.5739792526736099
We found 31 polytrauma patients with an mean ISS of 21.8 and a mean PTS of 25.4.	0.6606010103844574
Most of the multiply injured patients (n = 26) were stabilised with the UFN primarily.	0.6161729695402881
Follow-up of 44 patients ranged from 4 to 18 months postoperatively.	0.6604979752947123
According to our clinical and radiological score the results were excellent in 34 % of cases, good in 36.3 %, poor in 20.4 % and bad in 9 %.	0.832167003171832
Average fracture healing time was about 9.8 weeks.	0.5542155440651074
Fractures of the atlas account for 1-2 % of all vertebral fractures.	0.8978957058014381
We divide atlas fractures into 5 groups: isolated fractures of the anterior arch of the atlas, isolated fractures of the posterior arch, combined fractures of the anterior and posterior arch (so-called Jefferson fractures), isolated fractures of the lateral mass and fractures of the transverse process.	0.7040863648152751
Isolated fractures of the anterior or posterior arch are benign and are treated conservatively with a soft collar until the neck pain has disappeared.	0.6691254567230377
Jefferson fractures are divided into stable and unstable fracture depending on the integrity of the transverse ligament.	0.4705420572174016
Stable Jefferson fractures are treated conservatively with good outcome while unstable Jefferson fractures are probably best treated operatively with a posterior atlanto-axial or occipito-axial stabilization and fusion.	0.49712381002276945
The authors preferred treatment modality is the immediate open reduction of the dislocated lateral masses combined with a stabilization in the reduced position using a transarticular screw fixation C1/C2 according to Magerl.	0.560191049902751
This has the advantage of saving the atlanto-occipital joints and offering an immediate stability which makes immobilization in an halo or Minerva cast superfluous.	0.4019236343589473
In late instabilities C1/2 with incongruency of the lateral masses occurring after primary conservative treatment, an occipito-cervical fusion is indicated.	0.5392244897642238
Isolated fractures of the lateral masses are very rare and may, if the lateral mass is totally destroyed, be a reason for an occipito-cervical fusion.	0.7152857105868844
Fractures of the transverse processes may be the cause for a thrombosis of the vertebral artery.	0.8848164311795981
No treatment is necessary for the fracture itself.	0.6980972622398876
Reported is the case of a 36-year-old man with neurofibromatosis type 1 with lethal haemorrhage from rupture of the left common iliac artery.	0.6830673812748501
Histologically and immunohistochemically, no hints on angiodysplasia as a possible cause of bleeding were detected.	0.556287072275619
Considering the literature and the histological findings in the area of rupture, a local weakness of the vascular wall caused by the neighbouring neurofibromatous proliferates was most probably the reason for bleeding.	0.809541914750393
We report on a 2-year-old girl with chronic bullous disease of childhood (CBDC).	0.6719581378994938
Concomitantly with a feverish gastrointestinal infection caused by Salmonella enteritidis, the child presented with lesions resembling impetigo contagiosa on the legs and face.	0.4477848174891102
Following antibiotic treatment with cephalosporins p.o.	0.30701175588782037
she developed typical symptoms of CBDC, i.e.	0.3274980995677828
tense blisters on erythematous skin in the perineal area, on the flexor aspects of the thighs and upper arms and on the face.	0.5680113243410373
Direct immunofluorescence revealed a linear IgA deposition along the basement membrane zone, confirming the diagnosis of CBDC.	0.3737930569390954
These lesions cleared rapidly after treatment with dapsone p.o.	0.49949454920000885
This case prompted us to consider new aspects of the pathogenesis, clinical entity and treatment of this rare bullous disease of childhood.	0.7085389556018836
Systemic administration of strontium-89 is an important option for pain relief in advanced prostate carcinoma with multiple osseous metastases.	0.5713894990588048
Recently, rhenium-186-HEDP was introduced as a new substance which has important advantages (shorter physical half-life, scintigraphic imaging, dose distribution).	0.5443638428426256
The myelosuppressive effect can be estimated more accurately in advance, so that adverse effects can be reduced and the treatment can be repeated after a shorter period of time and more often.	0.6789827261841241
Our study comprises 15 treatments with rhenium-186-HEDP in advanced prostate cancer patients using the 1.4- to 2-fold standard dose.	0.6922125712220003
The response rate, estimated as reduction in pain and increase in patient mobility, was 87 % with no major myelosuppressive effects.	0.7310473283284017
The mean duration of pain relief was 4-6 weeks.	0.6407206099648687
All four patients with repeated therapy were also responding to the second treatment.	0.5514784127586411
Radionuclide therapy for painful osseous metastases with rhenium-186-HEDP appears to be an effective and, even at higher doses, safe procedure.	0.6927212236718008
Cyclophosphamide is a potent immunosuppressive drug which is widely used to treat renal and central nervous system manifestation of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).	0.4784281724638982
It is employed especially to prevent renal failure in lupus nephritis.	0.4135510412555062
Within the last decade intravenous cyclophosphamide bolus therapy has become the standard therapy in severe SLE due to its tendency towards a higher efficacy and fewer side effects as compared to oral application.	0.6756645478428845
Studies on the slightly more cost-effective oral cyclophosphamide bolus therapy have recently been published, however, there are no data on long-term results yet.	0.714414200928396
Here, we review the effects and side effects of cyclophosphamide as well as recent clinical studies on cyclophosphamide bolus therapy in SLE.	0.7247076988735697
Because of the possible side effects, especially the high risk of malignancies, which sharply increases at a cumulative dose of approximately 60g, cyclophosphamide should be used cautiously.	0.7502746136535849
Cyclophosphamide bolus therapy should only be performed in hospitals with special experience.	0.6300855328548712
The optimal time to perform acute ACL reconstruction with respect to arthrofibrosis is discussed.	0.5465631240480654
Most authors prefer delayed surgery.	0.1394145576806717
The definition of the term "acute" varies between 48 hours and 4 weeks.	0.4890130573323025
In this study the limit was set at 60 hours.	0.6537683913915967
Acute ACL reconstruction was performed in 39 patients and delayed surgery in 35 after they had regained full ROM.	0.5821855212810453
The incidence of arthrofibrosis was not higher in the acutely operated group whereas overall inability to work was 44% lower in this population.	0.5801170280349653
When the indication is clear, we think that acute ACL reconstruction may be performed within 60 hours without a higher risk of postoperative development of arthrofibrosis.	0.6314102256525473
Nowadays, this strategy should also be considered for economic reasons.	0.7778245623164318
After some introductory remarks on the influence of psychosocial risk factors on the developmental outcome of premature infants this review summarizes the current knowledge about intervention programs for prematures and their parents with a special focus on parent-centered programs.	0.6130375321984802
Positive effects of intervention programs are found in an improvement of cognitive development, parental sensitivity and the home environment.	0.6436226889088255
Only parent-centered interventions enhanced the quality of parent-infant interaction.	0.4440267116250904
It is questioned if those effects are also reliable for very premature infants and are found in the long term.	0.5394390555582564
Further programs should focus on parent- and parent-infant centered interventions.	0.5165711105215199
Methodological problems of intervention studies and further research perspectives on parent-centered interventions are discussed.	0.4457915802153573
The surgical therapy of the rupture of a distal biceps tendon and a modified postoperative treatment is described.	0.6999325346150201

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMP) are involved in important processes of tumor invasion and metastasis.	0.6111077496553621
In the study presented, matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) and 3 (MMP3), the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1) and the complex MMP1/TIMP1 were measured by ELISA tests specific for these proteins in blood plasma.	0.7867019203773293
These components have been investigated in prostate cancer patients (PCa) with metastases (n = 18; T2, 3, 4 pN1, 2M1), prostate cancer patients without metastases (n = 29; T2, 3 pN0M0), patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH; n = 29) and in healthy men (n = 35).	0.722765862281878
Mean values of MMP1 and of the complex MMP1/TIMP1 were not different among the four groups.	0.5067520487629007
The mean values of MMP3 and especially TIMP1 were significantly higher in prostate cancer patients with metastases compared with controls, BPH patients and prostate cancer patients without metastases.	0.5587046806116548
Ten of these 18 patients had TIMP1 levels higher than the upper reference limit.	0.4432967065975921
TIMP1 concentrations correlate to the tumor stage but not to the tumor grade.	0.6176267824199193
These results indicate, that TIMP1 could be an potential marker for metastases in prostate cancer patients.	0.6043005387560673
The interventional occlusion of atrial septal defects still represents an experimental approach.	0.41731058016021283
As in all intracardiac implants able the double umbrella device (ASDOS) is affected by late complications, particularly when involving umbrella thrombosis and umbrella dislocations.	0.5908591907268267
The demonstration of 4 case reports shows that late postinterventional complications can manifest in unspecific cardial and noncardial symptoms in patients with an ASDOS device.	0.5175180605253645
The diagnosis of a late complication was in all cases confirmed by transesophageal echocardiography and represents an indication for immediate surgical explantation.	0.7204743492940051
For early diagnosis and safe handling of late complications after ASDOS implantation the knowledge of the emergency physician about postinventional problems of this device is essential.	0.6712569592433737
Every ASDOS patient who is suspected of suffering from late postinterventional complications should undergo immediate transesophageal echocardiography.	0.399737756844303
The emergency physician should get in touch with the implantation center immediately.	0.4323125288242969
Furthermore, the concept of interventional occlusion therapy of atrial septum defects needs further development to avoid late complications.	0.49852592640515814
The goal of cardiocerebral resuscitation is to return to the pre-arrest level of neurological function and to reintegrate the patient into his former social circumstances.	0.44861058053148695
This study evaluated the long-term outcome of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in a country-area.	0.6920375649739589
The economic burden of congestive heart failure is significant.	0.4359603647831247
Approximately 1 to 2% of total health care expenditure is attributed to the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of congestive heart failure.	0.7448250173742809
A great share of this expenditure is related to the costs of long-term complications and productivity losses.	0.6595610453587372
In order to manage these costs, providers and policymakers increasingly have to focus on economicaly attractive interventions.	0.41819375915749346
Teleconsultation is a consultation between two or more physicians about the diagnostic work-up and therapeutic strategy in the treatment of an individual case by means of modern telematics.	0.614133755373476
Due to more complex therapeutic strategies and legally defined formal requirements, the need for teleconsultation will increase significantly in the future.	0.6216594173938316
Rapid technical improvements in telematics will progressively facilitate the practical performance of teleconsultation (based upon an ISDN network in the beginning, later on by the use of a national health network).	0.4727135563609767
The medicolegal aspects of teleconsultation have already been defined sufficiently for use in surgery.	0.42996857257470356
However, the question of adequate financial compensation for this type of medical service is still unclear.	0.6357582876745811
All 459 surgeons and orthopedists in private practice in Berlin (approx.	0.32193110582656975
3.5 Million inhabitants) were contacted in March 1997 and asked to cooperate.	0.6693318316151318
An 18-point questionnaire was sent out to record the physician's experience with atraumatic and posttraumatic neck complaints, which was returned by only 112 (25%).	0.6442573779221983
According to their assessment these physicians treated ca.	0.39385131911054844
47 000 atraumatic patients with cervical complaints and ca.	0.2828463479182789
7800 with a history of a preceeding trauma over a 12-month-period (1996).	0.538551518320274
All responders had treated patients with posttraumatic complaints; about 60% stated having treated between 20 and 60 patients per year, 25% a smaller and 15% a greater number of patients.	0.7467246372181422
The average treatment time was stated to be 2-5 weeks by 60% of the physicians, 10% listed a peak of 6-7 weeks and another 10% in excess of this peak.	0.7596899456062889
Half of the physicians stated having also treated patients with a cervical trauma not caused by another person (a total of 500 cases).	0.7273971502366035
Symptoms/findings were considered as specific for a traumatic origin by ca.	0.38575237931451417
50% of the physicians and as nonspecific by the other half.	0.7557209902020119
It is noteworthy that the physician's point of view was influenced by personal accident experience (accident as a car passenger): 54% of the 26 physicians with posttraumatic cervical complaints considered these symptoms to be traumaspecific compared to only 35% of 40 physicians with accidents but without cervical symptoms.	0.5684539763422178
The statement that financial gains are frequently a motivating factor for patients that influenced the symptoms and course was confirmed by 22% of the physicians without accident experience compared to 62% of the physicians with accidents without cervical involvement.	0.6460755712880834
Of the physicians 32% were already familiar with personal cervical complaints in middle age unrelated to trauma and another 18% considered them sometimes a disease parameter.	0.6014086404018201

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used as a diagnostic tool for special indications in oral and maxillofacial surgery.	0.6461711313613894
We describe a new MRI technique that presents images in a panoramic view analogous to orthopantomography.	0.42398771144798286
This technique is based on three-dimensional T1- and T2-weighted sequences.	0.7061273781506925
The familiar panoramic view in MRI provides better orientation and makes diagnosis faster and easier.	0.2939864171082358
However, the acquisition time is long (6-12 min per sequence), with a correspondingly high risk of motion artifacts.	0.7918564483266204
Moreover, the final workup is also time-consuming.	0.5880577790638085
These restrictions could be overcome by progress in hardware and software.	0.2724299307792886
There are promising indications for dental MRI.	0.2861070354728512
During recent years home ventilation has been shown to be useful for a growing number of patients with neuromuscular diseases and respiratory insufficiency caused by weakness of the respiratory muscles.	0.7181156998669996
Despite its technical simplicity, home ventilation leads to a number of social, ethical, medical and infrastructural problems.	0.5661390441180979
This consensus paper discusses the special situation of patients with neuromuscular diseases in home ventilation and describes the current thinking in the following topics: (1) definition of home ventilation; (2) aims of home ventilation; (3) indications and preconditions of home ventilation; (4) techniques and forms of home ventilatory support; (5) preparation for and practical questions of home ventilation; (6) stopping home ventilation.	0.6072953350047398
Pseudo-obstruction of the colon is characterized by a massive colonic dilatation without mechanical obstruction.	0.5223787841864382
It is rarely after hip surgery, however, untreated it may be complicated by a life threatening perforation of the colon.	0.6021721505019141
In a retrospective analysis we reviewed 11 patients (4 women, 7 men, mean age 75.2 years, range 67 to 86 years) with pseudo-obstruction of the colon after hip surgery in the years 1995 to 1998.	0.8575262957027664
In relation to all patients aged 65 years and older who underwent surgery of the hip, the prevalence was 1.06%.	0.8620878330534103

The aim of the present study was to test polylactic acid material as a controlled release carrier for polypeptide growth factors.	0.5901949031405253
Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was incorporated into DL polylactic acid (PLA) pellets under hyperbaric CO2 pressure in two different ways.	0.5108403091810994
(1) Lyophilized bFGF was crushed and mixed with PLA granules, filled into cylindric moulds of 5 x 3 mm, and submitted to hyperbaric CO2 pressure.	0.40547867814749644
(2) Lyophilized bFGF was reconstituted in phosphate buffer, mixed with PLA granules, and relyophilized.	0.43934147643971316
In vitro assessment of bFGF release from the PLA implants by immunoassay showed that loading of PLA with crushed lyophilized bFGF resulted in a rapid and high release, while loading by solubilized bFGF and relyophilization led to a low and more regular release of the polypeptide growth factor.	0.5206492549008384
Intestinal neuronal dysplasia (IND) was initially described as a developmental abnormality of the submucous plexus in children.	0.566341463441632
In recent years this abnormality has also been observed in adults with chronic constipation.	0.5692364199358965
The aim of this study was a morphometric characterization of this disease.	0.6362066513847211
The investigation was performed with 10 adults with IND, compared with 10 healthy control probands.	0.6591760627703137

Management of laryngeal carcinoma located at the anterior commissure remains controversial.	0.486714032111486
Local control rates with radiotherapy or surgery are not as good as those seen after treatment of midcord lesions.	0.5011567140103572
The vertical partial laryngectomy with epiglottic reconstruction (VPLER) may be a more successful approach to such lesions.	0.6034435071815666
The charts of all patients treated for larynx carcinoma between 1991 and 1996 at the authors' institutions were reviewed to identify those patients treated with VPLER as described by Sedlacek in 1965, Kambic in 1976 and Tucker in 1979.	0.568543935610037
Indications for performing surgery and outcome data of patients were collected and analyzed according to the indications for surgery, surgical technique, perioperative complications, oncological outcomes and functional results.	0.7320329904558973
Twelve patients were identified that had been treated with VPLER.	0.701504395955449
Indications for surgery included five patients with local recurrences following endoscopic laser partial laryngectomies, four cases with previously untreated primary tumors at the anterior commissure (T2 N0-2 M0), two with local recurrences following radiotherapy, and one with recurrence following frontolateral partial laryngectomy.	0.7152159009429543
There were no postoperative complications except for one laryngocutaneous fistula that required secondary repair.	0.5044547141800417
All patients were able to swallow at the tenth postoperative day.	0.44175223263612673
All had their tracheostomies closed after completion of wound healing, (a mean of 17 days after surgery).	0.7361299249183725
Phonatory results were usually poor.	0.21070714643537328
Two local recurrences occurred during the follow-up period.	0.487495231969536
However, both patients were salvaged with total laryngectomies and have since been free from disease.	0.5629500516409879
All other patients are alive and well.	0.4489811516320941
Our findings show that VPLER is an effective surgical approach for carcinoma at the anterior commissure of the larynx that cannot be adequately managed with transoral laser surgery or simple frontolateral partial laryngectomy.	0.5205808343265967
This study demonstrates that the procedure can be successfully applied to the treatment of local recurrences following initial raditherapy or surgery.	0.7274867352159096
No major complications occurred in our study.	0.6330462142008114
Traditionally, intra-vitam diagnosis of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) of brain supplying arteries is a domain of conventional selective angiography.	0.5040592944573024
We are aware of only two publications reporting of ultrasound displayed intimal and medial variants of carotid artery FMD, in one case each.	0.5288726583035366
We present a patient in whom color-coded duplex-sonography revealed a web-like carotid artery bulb stenosis meeting the specific criteria of a subtype of intimal FMD.	0.48991540330432465
The relationship between depression and the outcome of low back surgery was investigated.	0.6958313946422939
Data analysis was based on two assumptions: (1) Presurgical assessments of depression are correlated with the outcome of surgery, and, therefore, depression can be interpreted as a risk factor for surgical failure.	0.6242525424128422
(2) Postsurgical assessments of depression are correlated with the outcome of surgery, and therefore, depression can be interpreted as a response to treatment failure.	0.681999251610051
The sample was made up of 78 patients who had undergone lumbar nucleotomy and 132 patients with lumbar spondylodesis.	0.510513517717001
Treatment outcome was evaluated 6 months after surgery in the nucleotomy group and 9 months after surgery in the spondylodesis group.	0.7280395437451606
Depression was assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).	0.2999445664656184
Measures of treatment outcome were an objective rating system for the surgical result, functional impairment, return to work, subjective estimations of the patient, and pain intensity.	0.7293086674704798
Presurgical depression scores showed no significant relationship with surgical outcome in nucleotomy patients.	0.4742132673355373
In spondylodesis patients, however, there was a significant negative correlation with the patients' subjective outcome ratings.	0.8390871443509511
Postsurgical depression scores, on the other hand, were significantly related to almost all of the outcome variables in both treatment groups.	0.7071662861322989
Patients with clinically relevant postsurgical depression scores were significantly more likely not to benefit sufficiently from surgery than those with clinically not relevant depression scores.	0.5090607104751634
Our findings favour assumption 2 over assumption.	0.21852403374193166
In the light of our findings, depressiveness is interpreted as a response to a non-beneficial outcome of surgery.	0.4902771677102971
The need for an interdisciplinary approach combining psychological counseling or treatment and physical therapy for those patients who do not benefit from surgery is discussed.	0.600256703018619
Using electron-beam computed tomography (EBCT) with short exposure times of 100 or 50 ms and the capability of acquiring up to 2 x 17 images/s it is possible to study most of the important morphological and functional determinants of the heart.	0.6094634410675619
Various examples of studies in acute and chronic cardiac diseases are shown to demonstrate the use of EBCT to determine quantitatively left ventricular volumes (ml), myocardial mass (g), wall thickness changes over the cardiac cycle (mm/s), myocardial perfusion (ml/100 g/min) and the extent of coronary calcification (calcium score) and qualitatively the state of the proximal 4-6 cm of the subepicardial coronary arteries.	0.7058994741012167
The knowledge of these determinants seems very useful in excluding cardiac dysfunction, in the early recognition of cardiac disease and in the evaluation of the haemodynamic severity of coronary artery stenotic lesions.	0.8147622895751812
Further interdisciplinary studies are necessary to assess the clinical validity of these cardiac determinants, especially myocardial perfusion, using this advanced CT technology.	0.6507796371335561
Fractures and dislocations of the elbow are some of the most common injuries in childhood and adolescence.	0.8786760192846259
The majority occur in sport and play activities, e. g., a fall from gymnastics apparatus or a bike, or from popular sports items, such as skateboards or in-line skates.	0.5230626731074467
The injuries can be divided into pure dislocations of the joint and fractures of the distal humerus, proximal radius and ulna, or combinations of both.	0.7283948406533136
In addition, extra- and intraarticular fracture types are defined, with the latter as partial or complete joint lesions.	0.6891929292532079
Dislocations of the elbow joint or the radial head can occur as single injuries or in combination with a fracture.	0.6778888124413914
Supracondylar fractures and avulsion fractures of the medial epicondyle are the most frequent extraarticular lesions of the distal humerus.	0.8220001300216457
Fractures of the lateral condyle prevail is incomplete intraarticular lesions.	0.5178094929909679
In the forearm, radial head and neck fractures are predominant while typical and atypical Monteggia injuries have a special status.	0.5403576849443276
The complex joint construction and the age-dependent appearance of the epiphyseal ossification centers sometimes make a correct radiological diagnosis difficult.	0.5802185885973342
The trauma history and an exact, clinical examination help to verify the injury, as do comparative X-ray studies of the uninjured side when necessary (but not routinely).	0.6854784434598017
Unlike other anatomical areas, most elbow injuries - even in the growing skeleton - are treated operatively.	0.8599407908069064
Hereby, the growth plates have to be respected using minimal amounts of small implants.	0.6519384262556385
Additional immobilization in a cast for 2 - 4 weeks is necessary in most cases but does not lead to a functional deficit - in contrast to adults.	0.7965839139909704
The implants should be removed as early as possible.	0.3307845027092275
Despite all therapeutic efforts, a significant number of late sequelae, such as malunions and functional impairment, can be seen.	0.6516284142118643
The rate of long-term complications increases in cases of untreated displacement of fragments or joint instability.	0.5983543952041717
Corrective measures are performed only in selected cases and after the growth plates are closed.	0.6562112735799125
Our own treatment regime is demonstrated using exemplary clinical cases of the different injuries and the results of a long-term follow-up study on sports injuries of the elbow in children.	0.8127884549882367
Errors in diagnosis and therapy, as well as possible complications, are pointed out.	0.7145465860980296
2-adrenergic agonists, mimicking the action of the inhibitory transmitter norepinephrine, cause antinociception due to postsynaptic inhibition of spinothalamic projection neurons, presynaptic inhibition at the central nervous system termination of primary sensory nerves, presynaptic inhibition of brainstem noradrenergic neurons and a generalized decrease in central nervous system sympathetic efferent activity.	0.441735118569108
There is a mutual potentiation of antinociceptive effects of clonidine and morphine.	0.44535948280492355
Clonidine is used in chronic pain states for treatment of neuropathic, neuralgic and deafferentiating pain.	0.6625875614663237
Based on a meta-analysis of the studies published in the years 1996-1996, the therapeutic efficacy of systematically administered clonidine was evaluated in chronic pain states.	0.8780251218020187
Out of 403 screened published studies, only 9 fulfilled the selection criteria.	0.5035860344026866
Besides three case reports with successful clonidine treatment, four placebo-controlled studies could be analyzed treating the following chronic pain states: chest pain despite normal coronary angiograms; painful diabetic neuropathy; postherpetic neuralgia; hyperalgia in patients with sympathetically maintained pain and chronic low back pain.	0.5564463287304305
Although three studies demonstrated statistically significant improvement in pain scores, the improvement in pain relief in these cases was slight.	0.8166734715879652
Long-term treatment was successful in a few responders over a period of 17 months.	0.7475601770637853
Hyperalgesia caused by sympathetically maintained pain was relieved by topical (transdermal) application of clonidine.	0.348107427322605
Based on this evaluation a grade C recommendation is derived, which relates to responders.	0.5579230589605008
Successful treatment is expected only in pain states with increased sympathetic nervous system activity.	0.42032213167533333
Therefore, in chronic pain, treatment with systemic clonidine is of no significant value.	0.8256106579646985
Study objective: To investigate whether automatic tube compensation (ATC) or conventional pressure support (PS) is suit- able to compensate for the work of breathing imposed by the breathing circuit without altering the breathing pattern.	0.6442806079233069
DNA-based prenatal testing of the fetal genotype was performed in a family at risk for recurrence of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB).	0.5990743755876934
DNA from cultured fibroblasts and leukocytes from the peripheral blood of the previously affected offspring, DNA from parental leukocytes and DNA from fetal tissue obtained by chorionic villus biopsy was analysed by direct PCR amplification of known polymorphic regions within or flanking the type VII collagen gene, the canditate gene in RDEB.	0.4544786543380763
One flanking marker (D3S2/MspI) as well as two intragenic polymorphisms (C7/MspI, C7/Eco0109I) in exons 30 and 84 were informative in this family.	0.4185214554433345
Thus, based on the haplotype analysis and the lack of evidence for locus heterogeneity in RDEB, a phenotypically healthy child was predicted.	0.5344440457347033
This prediction was confirmed by the birth of a healthy female infant.	0.4559704856551944
The study reports successful determination of the fetal genotype by PCR-based prenatal diagnosis in a family at risk for recurrence of severe RDEB.	0.6110907217838647
Endothelins are peptides with powerful vasoconstrictor and mitogenic properties.	0.20438478794545065
It has become evident that endothelins are involved in many regulatory mechanisms of the circulation role both in short and in long term.	0.599499418212129
However, in many cases it remains unclear whether the alteration of the endothelin metabolism is a primary pathology or a secondary phenomenon.	0.7762493508409603
The synthesis of endothelin receptor antagonists and animal models with altered endothelin metabolism have opened a new era of endothelin research that will allow insight into the mechanisms of endothelin-action and eventually might lead to new therapeutic concepts.	0.4947479385074856
This review discusses the evidence both in favor and against pathogenic effects of endothelins in cardiovascular disease.	0.36444597288949915
The combination of fast MR sequences and rapid i. v. injection of paramagnetic contrast media provides information on cerebral perfusion.	0.5009120492166056
MR-perfusion imaging primarily depicts the relative cerebral blood volume.	0.4030689484563524
The aim of this study was to test whether MR-perfusion imaging with a clinical MR scanner using a standard 2D-FLASH sequence provides clinically relevant information on patients with cerebrovascular diseases and brain tumors.	0.5992079499654782
Brain infarctions, lesions in cerebral microangiopathy and occlusions of the carotid artery with very poor collateralization showed definite differences in perfusion imaging compared with normal controls.	0.44131676708013934
However, our results show that acceleration of the imaging sequence and optimization of the contrast bolus and data processing are prerequisites for the clinical use of this method, which in principle may provide information on the absolute cerebral blood volume and even blood flow.	0.8081986916474941
Lumbar Microdiscectomy requires special instruments and provides a good view with a narrow approach.	0.36491047738614196
The microscope is the best surgical aid.	0.48254137521314
Alternatives are a retractorintigrated light or headlamp.	0.22633634778234357
A specific complication of lumbar microdiscectomy - the wrong level - can be minimized by an exact preoperative planning.	0.739277496196598
Other complications like dural lesions and exessive bleeding are less frequent with the microscope because of the better view.	0.46761630711030405
The most severe complications that can occur with any lumbar disc operation, major vessel or visceral injury, can be avoided by lusing the new rongeur with a depth guard.	0.623457324561352
From January 1987 to March 1994 three hospitals in the city of Magdeburg treated a total of 103 subcutaneous Achilles tendon ruptures operatively.	0.47324368337956485
We created a special score to compare the outcome of the different operation techniques used.	0.7558734353404748
Important aspects of the follow-up examination were isokinetic measuring of power and staying power by means of a KIN-TREX dynamic measuring device and the clinical check-up in comparison with the histological results and the patients' history.	0.7851979018720772
Degeneration could only be proved histologically in 38,8 % of the cases.	0.6084066805396567
The average score of all OP methods applied was 767 of possible 1000 points.	0.331681601498016
The adaptation suture (781 points), Silfverskiold's technique (772 points) and the fibrin adhesive technique (754 points) showed approximately the same results.	0.6455911245835939
The theory that all of the ruptures have a histological degeneration background seems to be wrong.	0.5488165866548363
Isokinetic measuring can be very helpful in preparing a postoperative regimen to find the optimum load.	0.47954646081717506
To determine wether a somatic dysfunction of head joints depends from segmental muscle strain, we investigated 89 patients before, during and after general anesthesia.	0.6147486750529517
We examined the disturbed joint motion as exclusive criterion for a somatic dysfunction, because through an anesthesia with endotracheal intubation including complete neuromuscular blockade segmental influences on the inspected joint were eleminated.	0.526510382676647
For complete muscle relaxation as required for orotracheal intubation a non depolarizising muscle relaxant was used.	0.36461473511262943
Somatic dysfunctions were found most frequent for side-inclination and retroflexion in segment O/C1.	0.3224619081830574
Both before as well as during complete neuromuscular blockade could be found in the majority of examinations (89,1 %) similar restraints of joint motions.	0.6910220735526567
To 10,9 % were found, that somatic dysfunctions established before the muscle relaxant was applicated, were no more demonstrable under complete blockade of neuromuscular transmission.	0.7048504739662708
Different theoretical models are presented for the interpretation of our results.	0.5463857255891418
We assume, that the disturbance of one component of the metamer organized segment is the basic phänomenon of somatic dysfunction.	0.5446434356766886
This disturbance break through the spinal segmental inhibition and expand into the segment.	0.30936890361310626
Subsequently we discuss to replace the term "somatic dysfunction" through "segmental dysfunction" and to define it as increasing of nozizeptive afference in the segment over a determined period of time with breakthrough of the spinal segmental inhibition threshold.	0.5945311360892789
Postoperative intestinal atonia is a complication which is likely to occur in patients predisposed for constipation and in patients after intra-abdominal operations.	0.6508520263524632
The postoperative delay of bowel movement, however, is often also related to the type of anaesthesia being used.	0.5629953743682171
In order to evaluate the magnitude of an anaesthetic-induced postoperative delay of bowel movement, two types of intravenous-based anaesthesia using fentanyl/midazolam (1 mg/25 mg; dosage 0.1 ml/kg/h), and ketamine/midazolam (250 mg/25 mg; dosage 0.1 ml/kg/h) respectively were compared with a volatile anaesthetic technique (enflurane; mean concentration 1.5 vol%).	0.6988195896722805
In three groups of patients (each n=15) undergoing elective surgery of the lower extremities, induction of anaesthesia was accomplished with methohexital (1 - 1.5 mg) followed by succinylcholine (1.5 mg/kg) to facilitate intubation.	0.854456858908297
For the maintenance of muscle relaxation vecuronium bromide was used.	0.3743967249042241
All patients were given droperidol to prevent postoperative emesis, and they were artifically ventilated with N2O/O2 (60: 40) to normal end-expiratory CO2 concentrations.	0.781030234816589
No anticholinergic agents were used at the end of operation since they are known to interfere with bowel motility.	0.4848753167188809
In order to determine gastro-intestinal motility, the H2 exhalation test was used.	0.5961746579300815
For this purpose 40 g lactulose in 100 ml of water was given to all patients via a gastral tube shortly before extubation.	0.5152998289701957
Lactulose is broken down by bacteria once it enters the colon, and H2 is released, taken up by the vascular system and exhaled.	0.48926091982096176
Postoperatively, patients were asked to exhale into a 20-ml syringe every 10 min.	0.546780599786514
The content was analysed for hydrogen (ppm), using an electrochemical sensor (GMI exhaled hydrogen monitor).	0.45064920503333006
From the time of lactulose instillation to a threefold increase in endexpiratory hydrogen concentration (compared to the preoperative value), gastro-coecal transit time was computed.	0.5212837747116668
All three groups of patients were comparable in age, height and body weight.	0.7342421736991984
Also, the duration of operation was comparable in all three groups.	0.7834568968114407
Mean gastro-coecal transit time was 204 ( +/- 19.6 SD) min following enflurane, 302 ( +/- 32.8 SD) min following fentanyl/-midazolam and 210 ( +/- 28.8 SD) min following ketamine/midazolam anaesthesia.	0.5991025239274937
The gastro-intestinal inhibition after the opioid-based anaesthetic technique was significantly prolonged (p<0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test).	0.4770310132497191
There was no significance between patients after ketamine-based anaesthesia and those who had the volatile anaesthetic.	0.6060183544273718
When using intravenous anaesthesia with an opioid, gastro-intestinal inhibition, especially in patients prone to have constipation, is likely to develop postoperatively.	0.6931743939444532
In classical neuroleptanaesthesia and in analgosedation in the ICU, the simultaneous use of the butyrophenone droperidol seems to counteract the inhibition of opioid-related gastrointestinal motility.	0.5561140274570232
In cases of opioid-related gastrointestinal atonia a gastrokinetic compound may be necessary to overcome this effect on intestinal motility.	0.5114516435297326
In a prospective study 20 patients were monitored with serial sonograms and radiographs during distraction osteogenesis at the lower limb.	0.5504338897269729
All sonograms were obtained in four planes using a 7.5 MHz transducer.	0.5753173269550931
The distraction gap was seen as a sonolucent area in all patients after corticotomy.	0.656792814349723
At an average of 20.7 (14-28) days after the beginning of the distraction, echogenic foci occurred and showed increasing longitudinal alignment with further distraction.	0.7814318667455833
Radiographical signs of beginning mineralization were seen an average of 48.3 days after the start of the distraction.	0.6781618855981737
Exact measurement of the distraction gap was possible in all patients during lengthening.	0.7727893792900137
Bone healing complications and hematoma could be detected by ultrasound.	0.5561431038464613
A rapid increase of bone mineralization was seen after the distraction was stopped.	0.5164402071729323
With increasing cortication of the regenerate bone, sonograms showed a hyper-reflecting solid line so that further mineralization and the time of removal of the fixator could not be assessed by ultrasound.	0.5531012077654972
Ultrasound is more sensitive than radiography in identifying new bone formation during distraction, measuring the length of the distraction gap, and detecting early bone-healing complications and can therefore reduce the need for radiographs.	0.6341479348654195
The interval between the onset of symptoms in patients with head and neck cancers and the introduction of treatment was evaluated.	0.6566265759548437
During a 1-year period, patients were interviewed to determine the duration of any delays from the onset of complaints until the first visit to a doctor.	0.730567135582278
Also asked was how long it took to be referred to an ENT specialist and actual referral to our department.	0.3825952884962447
We then determined the interval from diagnosis to the introduction of therapy.	0.5291057555022178
It was found that the delay of patients who went directly to an otorhinolaryngologist was shorter (median, 8 weeks) than that of patients who first went to their family doctors (median, 13 weeks) (P<0.02).	0.8472062108187438
The latter then took an additional 4 weeks before sending patients to an otorhinolaryngologist.	0.41138317650008405
Referral from the ENT specialist to our department took another 2 weeks, as well as our staging and pre-therapeutic management.	0.5088665394197501
Our findings show that the patient himself is the critical factor in delaying diagnosis and therapy.	0.6433898894483905
Tumor patients with greater professional qualification went to their doctors earlier (P<0.0001) or more often went directly to an ENT specialist (P<0.002).	0.5179952714793171
Consultations of physicians without experience in otorhinolaryngology caused yet further delays.	0.29169939107347304
The present study deals with long-term dimensional changes in cemented Müller-type total hip endoprostheses.	0.5082171580549504
Creep and wear contribute to different extents to the dimensional changes in polyethylene.	0.3068130663058802
The total amount of polyethylene wear is represented by the displacement of the femoral head into the socket.	0.47419246857778785
Within the first postoperative years, the head shifts up to a relatively high rate of about 0.5 mm per year.	0.9942025317024148
This rate diminishes after 5 years to an average of about 0.1 mm (ceramics) and 0.2 mm (metal) per year.	0.7696653806344843
Values exceeding 0.2 mm per year for the shift of the femoral head are considered to be unfavourable with regard to a probable loosening of the prosthesis.	0.6340098018699063
In this study we determined the orientation of the centre of the prosthetic head in relation to the wire marker of the polyethylene cup, comprising in all 369 total hip prostheses.	0.6638199980560335
After an average of 77 months, 96 % of the prostheses with ceramic heads (n = 109) had a wear rate of less than 0.2 mm per year.	0.7454723612577655
Using metal heads (Protasul-2 and Protasul-10) this rate could only be measured in 71 % (n = 109) of the prostheses (61.5 months).	0.7396807173219219
The combination ceramics-polyethylene produces half of the total amount of wear produced by metal-polyethylene.	0.44156951537719114
Younger patients should preferably be treated with a ceramic ballhead.	0.6113689205287085
The so-called amyopathic dermatomyositis is a rare variant of dermatomyositis which has attracted increasing interest during the last years.	0.5497106276392697
One finds the classical signs of dermatomyositis such as periorbital edema and erythema, erythematous macular and papular lesions localized at bony prominences (so-called Gottron's papules), generalized pruritus, photosensitivity, and a cutaneous histopathologic picture compatible with skin lesions of dermatomyositis.	0.5041673944606974
Crucial for the diagnosis is the exclusion of myositis by clinical examination, EMG and histology.	0.7424472732477586
Furthermore, longterm supervision of patients is advisable in order not to miss the appearance of early signs of myositis.	0.5076271167045385
The longest reported follow-up of amyopathic dermatomyositis patient is 4 years; however, it cannot be excluded that these cases will eventually culminate in classical dermatomyositis.	0.5800318966111536
In this paper we describe two cases and discuss the differential diagnosis and therapy; also, the term "Premyopathic dermatomyositis" is proposed, to indicate that the full picture is to be expected in most cases.	0.8646833941441906
The primary renal angiosarcoma is a rarely seen highly malignant tumor.	0.44074551334679574
Making a diagnosis based on histology may prove difficult.	0.3538092065412416
Because of hematogenous formation of metastases and bad prognosis in most cases we recommend that the surgical intervention be followed by the well tolerated systemic chemotherapy with Doxorubicin and Ifosfamid.	0.6510395518641025
This study compares the results of the outpatient-based program of the Cochlear Implant Center Ruhr with inpatient-based rehabilitation, which is almost exclusively performed in Germany.	0.6262750010565895
The Department of Otorhinolaryngology at the University of Essen in Germany provided 52 patients with either 22- or 24-channel Nucleus cochlear implants from March 1996 to July 1999.	0.5993333473032112
Almost all patients (n=49) were rehabilitated on an outpatient basis, which is the standard in many cochlear implant centers outside Germany.	0.7789579694597564
Syringe drivers are used in anaesthetics, intensive care and emergency medicine to deliver small volumes of highly potent drugs with continuous, constant and reproducible flow.	0.49834288361176815
For early recognition of interruptions of the drug delivery caused by occlusion of the infusion system, an alarm is triggered as soon as the system pressure exceeds a certain limit.	0.6085841709892249
The sensitivity of this alarm depends on the flow rate, type-specific cut-off pressure and the elastic parameters of the infusion system.	0.7247138113868151
The sudden release of pressure built up in the system after occlusion occurred can cause delivery of an uncontrolled drug bolus and hence an additional hazard.	0.47110103832876443
Methods: Six syringe drivers that are widely used in clinical practice were tested for alarm delay and bolus delivery in the event of an occlusion in the system.	0.6391946290079406
First, the alarm pressures at flow rates of 10, 50 and 100 ml/h were measured.	0.620883325855812
Then the alarm delay time and bolus volumes post-occlusion were assessed, using a basic infusion system (syringe+single infusion set).	0.5565117280879993
Finally, several alterations to the system like extension, tap battery with germ filters or branching were made and their impact on alarm delay and bolus volume measured.	0.4784577169689583
Results: Because of the great differences in alarm pressures between the devices tested, there were marked differences in the alarm delay at same flow rates.	0.725006093202635
Predictably, there was an indirect proportional link between alarm delay and flow rate.	0.7124624209444115
Using the basic infusion system, alarm delays between 23 s and 143 min were measured.	0.3306308351693341
In two of the tested syringe drivers, a pressure-release mechanism is activated with the pressure alarm, which prevented bolus application.	0.7135699629209726
In the other devices, release of the pressure in the occluded system caused boli of 0.5-7 ml.	0.8324993504842086
Variations in the actual syringe volume and insertion of a second connection tube had no impact on alarm delay and bolus volume.	0.516534951481332
Tap batteries, parallel running syringe drivers or trapped air in the system, however, caused marked increase in both alarm delay (107%) and bolus volume (+147%).	0.5383766788406862
Discussion: Unidentified occlusions of the system cause grave malfunctioning of syringe drivers.	0.44249294944866013
While applying highly potent drugs, the discontinuation of drug delivery with subsequent bolus application can cause vital danger to the patient.	0.49989510608855703
As a result of the significant time delays in the pressure alarms, the devices tested do not provide sufficient protection against unrecognized system occlusion.	0.622506003362798
Syringe drivers with adjustable alarm pressure can be set close to the actual infusion pressure.	0.4642141293619097
A further important point is that one should aim at a reduction in the elastic properties of the infusion set because of the great impact on alarm delay and bolus volume.	0.6335025850438168
Because the overall results of conservative treatment for distal radial fractures have been unsatisfactory, it is rarely used.	0.6482767241988872
However, minimally invasive methods such as stabilization by external fixation and percutaneous K-wire pinning are being increasingly used.	0.5224875922094266
A justified indication for the use of K-wire pinning is that it provides an opportunity to achieve good and very good short- and long-term anatomic and functional results.	0.665358986669559
Short-term supplementary immobilization with a minimized plaster cast or protective external fixation is generally considered to be useful.	0.5834740056665116
Reports on plaster-free functional treatment after K-wire pinning have been published.	0.4739691278571219
The indications therefore need to be further specified.	0.4824236044341696
Follow-up studies and an analysis of our patients show a strong increase in K-wire stabilization and good-to-very good results in 75% of the cases.	0.8312837922225832
Involvment of the genitouronary tract by lymphoproliferative disorders is rare.	0.24672454189965884
Rapid proliferating Burkitt's lymphomas could mimic acute diseases.	0.18740731292386323
Due to the extreme chemosensitivity, the lymphoma is cureable and surgery should be done only for histology.	0.6193782753957275
Initial surgery should be restricted to acute abdominal complications or complete removal of localised resectable disease.	0.42769362264529437
In any case a multiagent chemotherapy is necessary.	0.4334673611824519
Wet autoclaving is a simple, reliable and time-effective method for antigen retrieval in routinely processed archival material.	0.512394156717183
Both routine diagnostic (e. g., oestrogen and progesterone receptors, cytoskeletal proteins) and research antibodies (e. g. various p53 antibodies, mdm-2, bcl-2, MIB-1) are reported to demonstrate its application.	0.6170301093589546
Wet autoclaving may allow successful application of antibodies in paraffin-embedded tissues designed for use on frozen sections.	0.388348357412954
The technique has the poten-tial to reliably handle up to 200 sections at a time, without evidence of any significant damage to the sections or nuclear morphology.	0.5833133495014413
Classical stable plate osteosynthesis with its anatomical repositioning, absolute stability between fragments and medial support should only be applied to joint fractures and spongy bone.	0.4915406451212091
In cortical bone, the anatomical reposition connected with the plate promotes bone necrosis along the fracture and prevents callus formation.	0.5544019569189453
Direct cortical synthesis, a method also known as "primary bone healing", serves the bone's revascularisation and is not necessarily aimed at healing.	0.643813341226701
Thus, this may also be termed "necrosis healing".	0.6480412063904833
Along the shaft of long bones, elastic plate osteosynthesis, a biological method, is safer than and superior to the rigid technique.	0.6649334952627681
This even applies to short oblique and transverse fractures insofar as nailing does not appear feasible.	0.30874181083776714
Elasticity is achieved by leaving a flexible stretch of at least 2 - 4 holes, i.e.	0.5892666259559379
as long as possible, without screws over the fracture and by employing a titanium plate.	0.6102858968729021
Thus, there is no punctate fatigue leading to plate breakage.	0.5473780488359974
The fitting of third fragments is deliberately left out.	0.2302264753190316
The same applies to all kinds of compression with lag screws, tension devices or DC-gliding holes - and this with the intention of allowing micromovements in the fracture's fissure.	0.5659507022741003
Periost and muscle are not removed and the fracture is not examined.	0.4473268366518296
Healing occurs spontaneously via a fixating callus forming within the first 3 - 6 weeks out of the periost-soft tissue combination.	0.670558152767955
Histomorphological investigation dates the first woven- bone bridges between the fragments to 3 weeks subsequent to the accident.	0.4137134339199101
In Göttingen University trauma centre, 87 fractures have been attended to over 2 years using this technique.	0.47926852216134497
Despite considerable soft-tissue damage, no delayed bone healing, pseudoarthrosis or bone infection has been observed.	0.530778730493039
The risks of elastic plate osteosynthesis lie in unbiological and exaggerated reposition methods, too short a flexible stretch, and insufficient anchorage of the screws.	0.6227429351749126
Diagnosis of a thrombosis in the peripheral veins can now be made with almost 100% certainty using either phlebography or duplex sonography.	0.5877726039800062
A correct diagnosis depends on the expertise of the examiner.	0.41225007155985105
Both methods are available throughout Germany.	0.5203453039414822
Although both are equally suitable for primary diagnostic investigations, duplex sonography has assumed an important role due to the fact that it is not invasive.	0.6649963285493252
Phlebography is vital if there are specific issues that need to be clarified.	0.43679631708343286
This applies if invasive treatment methods are being considered, if an expert opinion is required or if scientific issues need to be determined.	0.6060104614894581
Discrepancy between clinical findings and the results of duplex sonography also constitutes an important indication for phlebography.	0.5727091590448339
In many institutions, both methods are used in a "golden partnership" in cases in which it is important to obtain comprehensive records.	0.8943842931569523
For frequent ventricular ectopic beats, currently, reassurance and pharmacological therapy are the mainstays of treatment.	0.48823021065550315
This study assesses the useful role of catheter ablation in eliminating frequent monomorphic ventricular ectopic beats in severely symptomatic patients.	0.47358254299576935
Catheter ablation was performed in 65 patients with frequent drug refractory ventricular ectopic beats.	0.5845546386774367
The site of origin of ventricular ectopic activity was accurately mapped by using pace mapping, earliest endocardial activation time, and unipolar mapping.	0.521279850869808
In 5 patients a new non-contact mapping was additionally performed.	0.44981250194574074
The ectopic focus was located in the right ventricular outflow tract in 37 and in the left ventricle in 28 patients.	0.7572979501179747
Ventricular ectopic beats were successfully eliminated by catheter ablation in 49/65 patients (75%).	0.5204353525945006
During a mean follow up of 13 +/- 11 months, 9 of 49 successful ablated patients (18%) had a recurrence.	0.7922387761919937
Radiofrequency catheter ablation can be successfully used to eliminate ventricular ectopic activity.	0.5121238784067204
It may, therefore, be a reasonable alternative for the treatment of severely symptomatic, drug resistant monomorphic ventricular ectopic activity.	0.6167099513796811
Injuries of the forefoot are a challenge for orthopaedic surgeons.	0.6184594368024879
After healing of bone and soft tissue damage, posttraumatic metatarsalgia can persist.	0.5533510595066518
The paper presents a therapy algorithm with newly designed insoles, which consist of the common orthopaedic adaptions like a rocker bottom and a stiffening of the sole.	0.5138717668766496
The therapy is shown on two cases.	0.4222988090572234
With these orthotics adequate is possible and pain relief realistic.	0.47333885502223366
Background: Myopic PRK up to 6 D is an approved and safe procedure.	0.49910560224591
The efficacy and safety of combined treatment of myopia and astigmatism in compound myopic astigmatism (PARK) have not yet been demonstrated.	0.5898371954875621
Nitric oxide (NO) can play an important role in the regulation of vascular tone and neurotransmission, as well as in non-specific immunoreactions and inflammation in a variety of tissues.	0.6505805132466237
Increased quantities of nitric oxide in respired air can be measured during inflammatory processes.	0.4431084215292587
However, the exact role and precise sources of NO under physiological and pathophysiological conditions within the airways remain to be defined.	0.5770204465706572
We report on a 55-year old patient who presented with a four month history of intermittent left thoracic painful attacks which radiated in the left arm.	0.7761638989153183
Both normal 12 lead electrocardiogram and treadmill stress tests showed no significant ST changes.	0.3975261469993726
A thallium-201 scintigraphy afterwards disclosed a non-transmural septal ischemia.	0.3237705374048213
The consecutively performed diagnostic catheterization revealed a severe, almost pouch-like proximal aneurysm of the right coronary artery with a maximal diameter of 15-20 mm as well as an aneurysmatic modified left coronary artery and an impaired left ventricular function (EF 49%).	0.6449989348917652
In the absence of coronary artery stenosis, the patient was treated conservatively with an ACE inhibitor (lisinoprile 20 mg/day) under accompanying effective anticoagulant therapy with coumadin.	0.7804354834038213
With this strategy the patient has been asymptomtic during the eight month follow-up period.	0.5514536685917845
We investigated in 17 children (mean 7.1 years) the continuous administration of tramadol following augmentation cystoplasty or exstrophy reconstruction.	0.7190407163069344
Mean duration of the tramadol administration on the pediatric ward was 3.8  +/-  1.1 days (initial dosage 0.25 mg/kg/per hour, dose adjustment by the nursing staff).	0.8017139909689067
Mean tramadol consumption was 0.21 mg/kg/h on day 1 and was reduced to 0.08 mg/kg/per hour on day 4.	0.7152837221912467
Median pain score (assessed with ten-step scales) was 5 before treatment and between 2.5 (day 1) and 0.5 (day 5) during therapy.	0.895923623633888
Lowest oxygen saturations (mean) ranged from 93.8 % to 95.2 %.	0.7177116593048222
Three patients (17.6 %) suffered from nausea/vomiting on 3 of 64 treatment days (4.7 %).	0.6490375610014381
Pruritus and extreme sedation did not occur.	0.23791618446194077
The continuous administration of tramadol is a simple and safe procedure following major urological surgery in children.	0.588646940748223
Over the past 5-7 years, there has been a renewed research interest into the mechanism as well as the development of newer "emerging" treatment modalities for atrial fibrillation.	0.7454875058850922
One of these novel therapies is the implantable atrial defibrillator.	0.5280908277446442
In this article we will review the basic and clinical research which has been used in the development of electrode systems and shock waveforms utilized by commercially-available implantable atrial cardioversion devices.	0.6179236105227366
In 26 patients with abscesses in the maxillofacial area, the electrolyte concentrations, pH and osmotic and hydrostatic pressures of the pus fluid were measured and calculated.	0.5242511899273675
The main cations identified were sodium (134  +/-  38 mmol/l) and potassium  (37  +/-  16 mmol/l) and as anions chloride (183  +/-  46 mmol/l) and bicarbonate (10  +/-  4 mmol/l).	0.7164395055731525
The pH value of the pus liquid was 6.164  +/-  0.233.	0.5629404528532524
The calculated mean osmotic pressure of the pus liquid was 7910  +/-  1455 mm Hg, whereas the measured physical pressure inside the abscess was 49  +/-  13 mm Hg.	0.5735216827241731
Both pressure types show time-dependent pressure curves.	0.47664428863814273
With time, the real pressure inside the abscess cavity increases, whereas the osmotic pressure decreases.	0.6358916773160282
There was no relationship between the two pressure types and the different species of microorganisms responsible for the inflammation.	0.7217485999742874
The results of the study reveal that abscesses can be regarded as osmotically active systems, and the mechanism by which the abscess is formed might be as follows.	0.7406170035683947
After penetration of virulent microorganisms into the tissue space, the area of acute inflammation is walled off by the collection of inflammatory cells.	0.5427774026723514
Destruction of tissue by products of the polymorphonuclear leucozytes takes place and results in liquefactive necrosis and a hypertonic abscess cavity.	0.4261555325495499
The inwards-directed flow of tissue fluids into the cavity via the abscess membrane causes volume expansion and generates pressure, two facts that can explain the swelling dynamics and typical symptoms of abscesses in the maxillofacial area.	0.45284515656041263
Internal mammary artery (IMA) bypass grafts have a satisfactorily long lasting blood supply to the myocardium.	0.4256510555490431
Their initial flow capacity can be insufficient with subsequent regional myocardial ischemia.	0.3581060082496868
This study represents a feasable surgical method to evaluate the effectiveness of the IMA graft function by temperature measurement of the heart during warm reperfusion after hypothermic cardioplegia.	0.6413133239238056
Twenty-five patients with multi-vessel coronary artery disease underwent coronary artery bypass grafting using the IMA as an arterial graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery and saphenous vein grafts to the remaining coronary arteries.	0.6153395203103145
Distal anastomoses were installed during cold intermittent blood-cardioplegic  arrest.	0.24051186466418265
After unclamping the aorta and IMA graft, the temperatures in cardiac front and rear sides were measured during the first five minutes of warm reperfusion.	0.5187979280406347
A sufficient IMA graft function was expressed by a typical rise of temperature: The cardiac front and rear sides showed a parabolic and exponential course, respectively.	0.4658937752850304
The rewarming speed expressed as the first derivative of temperature over time led to a sharp and early peak for the front side, and a smaller and delayed peak for the rear side.	0.6638523460951745
An insufficient IMA graft function could be recognized by atypical temperature courses.	0.378113189435395
Fabry's disease (Angiokeratoma corporis diffusum) is a rare X-chromosome linked recessive disorder belonging to the group of sphingolipoidoses.	0.6249217288185273
The basic defect involves the gene encoding alpha-galactosidase.	0.36865839834713265
Because this enzyme is responsible for decomposition of glycosphingolipids, its deficiency results in their accumulation in endothelial and smooth muscle cells.	0.47013838445042627
With time, generalized angiokeratomas, paresthesias, renal and cardiac insufficiency and cerebrovascular complications develop.	0.4955098939018742
We report a patient who in addition to the well-described findings also showed unique nail fold capillary changes not described so far.	0.6104354105093591

Benign, proliferative changes of the Brunner's gland are very rare and account for about 10 % of duodenal bulb neoplasias.	0.6470275571929492
The authors present a case of Brunner's gland adenoma of unusual dimensions (12 x 5 x 2.5 cm).	0.7150872117978551
The patient presented with vague epigastric discomfort as isolated symptoms.	0.26918477207610575
In this case we performed surgical treatment, including a duodenotomy and polypectomy.	0.7660443423167248
Because they are localized in the submucosa small, superficial endoscopic biopsies may fail to confirm the diagnosis.	0.4640689525194605
Malignancy seems to occur only very rarely, with only 14 cases reported in the literature.	0.6065433191070458
As the majority of Brunner's adenomas are quite small, endoscopic polypectomy will confirm the diagnosis and cure the condition in most cases.	0.62476987361892
Large symptomatic adenomas may require surgical resection.	0.21083666180746619
Objective: How does adjuvant training of strength and endurance influence the muscular, cardial, respiratory, immunological systems, and the quality of life during intrahepatical chemotherapy in a veteran athlete with liver metastasis after resection of a carcinoma of the rectum.	0.6279872807309115
Patient and method: A 58-year-old athlete with metastatic carcinoma of the rectum (pT3, N0, M-liver, G2) underwent regional chemotherapy (folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil) via an intrahepatic port system.	0.6775631942200179
Six cycles with 5 days each were applied.	0.29908746788368157
During the intervals between cycles (14 days), beginning in the 6th postoperative week, a strength and endurance training (duration 13 weeks) was carried out twice weekly with an intensity of 40-60 % of the maximum postoperative individual power and endurance (evaluated with weight and treadmill exercise tests and measurement of lactate).	0.6144836476684171
Before and after chemotherapy, an echocardiogram, resting and exercise electrocardiogram, lung function, natural killer cells and the gastrointestinal quality of life index (GLQI) was evaluated.	0.6931647367769144
After chemotherapy was finished, the effects of training were assumed.	0.5643789185462441
Results: Strength increased between 0 % and 144 %.	0.6876927455395495
Endurance improvement was measured on the last comparable submaximal intensity step, expressed by reduction of heart rate and lactate concentration by 10 and 21.5 %, respectively, improvement of lung function regarding FEV 1 and FCV by 12.9 and 11.3 %, respectively, and VC IN 11.4 %.	0.6425229736464525
The relative count of natural killer cells increased by 27.2 %, and the GLQI improved from 109 points (pathologic) to 129 points (normal).	0.5868474372666654
Conclusion: There were positive effects on muscular and cardial mechanisms of adaptation and on illness-related quality of life.	0.5813487394811798

Introduction: We report our experience with laparoscopic nephrectomy in comparison to open nephrectomy in geriatric patients.	0.7451772005909225
The laparoscopic technique is presented and the results are discussed with respect to the data from the current literature.	0.9907902521126333
Material and Methods: Since 1993, a total of 249 patient have undergone a nephrectomy for benign renal disease.	0.5281485276460295
In 131 patients a laparoscopic nephrectomy (in most cases via a transperitoneal approach) was performed and in 118 patients an open nephrectomy via a flank incision.	0.7080624254688876
Clinical parameters were compared between both groups as well as with respect to different age groups.	0.5406724840457776
Results: There were no differences in terms of operative results (operative time, pre- and postoperative hemoglobin) between the laparoscopy group and open nephrectomy group as well as among the different age groups.	0.7316130106682094
Patients in the laparoscopy group demonstrated significant advantages with respect to blood loss, transfusion rate, analgesic consumption, hospital stay, and convalescence.	0.6505136072711676
These advantages were not related to patient age.	0.36310141933759277
The complication rate was comparable for both groups; however, both groups showed an elevation of the complication rate in the age groups 75 to 84 years.	0.6749584093620515
The mortality rate within the first 30 days after nephrectomy was 1.7% in the open nephrectomy group.	0.8081501084439137
Conclusions: The laparoscopic nephrectomy offers comparable operative results (with less blood loss and a lower transfusion rate) when compared to open nephrectomy.	0.7522182814985867
In terms of postoperative parameters, patients in the laparoscopy group have significant advantages.	0.7209667253266677
Especially geriatric patients benefit from these advantages and, therefore, the laparoscopic approach should be the preferred technique for a nephrectomy in these patients.	0.6334952749988713
The vast majority of adder bites among children in Germany is caused by the common viper (vipera berus).	0.46331519835982
The venom that is applicated by the viper contains several enzymes, some of them with hemorrhagic and neurotoxic activity.	0.4846918428429266
Adder bites among children may be without any symtoms but as well may cause severe intoxication.	0.42942102259187664
The aim of this study was to evaluate the results after open Bankart repair using suture anchors in patients with recurrent posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability.	0.5647664563688598
Some 32 patients were prospectively observed for a mean of 40 months (24-60) after stabilization.	0.8203639531133274
The mean age at the time of operation was 29.7 years.	0.7407919159941149
All patients were postoperatively immobilized in a sling for 3 weeks.	0.5493251313162882
According to the criteria of Rowe, 29 patients (90.6 %) had good or excellent results.	0.7675849014712425
Two patients (6.3 %) developed recurrent instability 6-24 months postoperatively; 93.7 % were not or only slights limited in sports activities.	0.7706880428831354
Bankart repair is an excellent treatment for recurrent posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability.	0.478487198199782

The authors point out, that sufficient diagnostic methods and criteria are still not existing.	0.7095115949320229
But their development has its limits: In most cases a history of sexual abuse can be detected and therefore an intensive diagnostic "investigation" can be on a psychodynamic level a repetition of traumatic abuse.	0.5754288698764976
Many new methods have been introduced in reproductive medicine in recent years, and some have already found their way into clinical routine.	0.6353925315674558
Cryopreservation of oocytes and in vitro maturation and culture of primordial follicles do not play a significant role in patient treatment.	0.530522781108019
However, the short-term culture of oocytes before metaphase II does seem relevant.	0.5472158429147376
Blastocyst culture has mostly replaced coculture techniques and, given appropriate laws, provides adequate possibility of selecting embryos with high developmental and implantation potential.	0.418739729771554
An exact pronuclear diagnosis also has a high ability to predict the probability of implantation.	0.5551841056639453

The importance of spiral-CT is clinically accepted for diagnosing spreading disease and for making a decision about the therapy strategy for head and neck tumors.	0.3581899904451724
Its importance for follow-up after radiotherapy was examined in 26 patients with irradiated laryngeal tumors.	0.3837829580115184
Using spiral-CT multiple signs of alterations (n = 98) can be diagnosed, which are not only important for tumour relapse, but also for assessment.	0.6852624418071055
Spiral-CT offers the possibility of achieviny various additional information about the larynx that cannot be obtained with laryngoscopy.	0.4047550707548655
In follow-up examinations after radiation, laryngoscopy and spiral-CT are recommended as an integrated neck examination using the breath-holding technique (separately reconstructed) and also as functional spiral-CT of the vocal cords in "I"-phonation.	0.4601500446277371
In the years 1980-1992 surveys were undertaken to ascertain the occurrence of central nervous system infections in children in pediatric departments in the German provinces of Bavaria and Lower Saxony.	0.57666348824243
There was a very noticeable drop in viral meningitides over the survey years especially in mumps meningitis, i. e. from 199/205 in 1980 to 16/7 in 1992.	0.4627887642201472
In both states about 80 % of the viral meningitides could not be clarified etiologically.	0.6434107371687183
Whereas in Bavaria a steady increase in herpes simplex encephalitides and varizella zoster encephalitides was apparent (1/4 in 1980, 10/24 in 1992), the same development was not found in Lower Saxony.	0.6527515943809916
Although the number of measles encephalitides dropped in both states during the period of the survey, up to 6 cases of the illness occurred annually.	0.6809146164883456
Only in the case of herpes simplex encephalitis the rate of recovery shows a substantial improvement over the observation period, while for other forms the rate of partial recovery has remained approximately the same.	0.6375810942783705
Purpose: To assess patient reliability and compliance, most perimeters check for false-positive and -negative answers.	0.760721801417867
In this study the results of catch trials were obtained with video campimetry with respect to age-related changes and differences for tests using increment and decrement stimuli.	0.642753251010884
During a 7-year period (between July 1987 and June 1994) 19 patients were treated for Chopart dislocation.	0.7235671577980983
Seventeen patients were examined clinically 48 months following trauma.	0.6608939930477493
We found 1 excellent, 6 good, 6 mediocre, and 4 poor results.	0.7657142326543293
Only 4 patients were able to achieve their pre-accident level of work and no patients could return to sports at the same level.	0.515782594199959
In our patients, Chopart dislocation had a negative social consequence both at the work place and in recreational activities.	0.48812755567261834
In long-term follow-up, the Chopart dislocation was the most debilitating injury even for polytrauma patients.	0.5593298172292269
For incidents of malignant hyperthermia (MH) outside the hospital, a high number of unrecorded cases must be reckoned with because of an insufficient knowledge of emergency services and poor identification and documentation that make it impossible to classify acute situations under the diagnosis of malignant hyperthermia crisis.	0.5721280963126526
As a result, there are no statistical data in this field, and only case reports with a broad spectrum of suspected trigger mechanisms have been published.	0.8108555697439317
The case described in this report is a proved example of a non-anesthesia-related triggering of MH in a 21-year-old man who had had an anesthetic-induced MH manifestation in childhood, which was confirmed with an in vitro contracture test.	0.7067031097719795
After visiting a restaurant, he became unconscious and convulsive after consuming a high level of alcohol (2.9permil).	0.5098016682229929
The first cardiocirculatory arrest occurred directly before hospitalization.	0.2710009443997922
After admission, the patient showed a full-blown MH episode whose subsequent fatality was unavoidable in spite of adapted and optimal therapy.	0.5844882376569642
Suspected trigger mechanisms seem to be multifactoral (excessive alcohol consumption, over-heating, mental stress) as a forensic investigation did not point to any particular signs of typical trigger substances.	0.54941824728788
The case demonstrates again that an MH attack might be triggered under certain non-anaesthesia-related situations.	0.39309533724006135
For patients with an MH disposition, additional information on their behavior outside the hospital is required.	0.7119133014069947

Surgical treatment of diffuse peritonitis is applied very variably.	0.5027887847896281
There is no question that source control is the most important treatment principle, but the role of additional treatment concepts such as continuous postoperative peritoneal lavage remains controversial.	0.7584622717611623
In a prospective survey (1993-1996) we analyzed the need for additional treatment concepts in our patient material.	0.8750981061012763
In 186 patients with diffuse peritonitis we applied the concept of source control and extensive (20-30 l) intraoperative lavage.	0.5670730755701782
Additional treatment principles such as continuous postoperative peritoneal lavage (n = 17) or staged lavage (n = 5) were applied only "on demand", namely in 20 patients (11 %).	0.6447629520389596
In 166 patients (89 %) source control of diffuse peritonitis was possible.	0.5672463208197193
The mean severity of peritonitis (n = 186) was 28.5 (range 16-43) using the Mannheim Peritonitis Index.	0.8766167288739036
The primary cause of peritonitis in our patients was perforation or leakage in the lower GI tract (52 %).	0.5852486756733207
The hospital mortality rate was 12 % in the whole group, and the postoperative morbidity rate was 34 %.	0.9637220645884894
We conclude that nowadays, using high-quality intensive care as well as modern antiinfective treatment, only a few patients (ca.	0.7941414885237029
10 %) need additional therapy measures such as postoperative lavage.	0.4470620969474711
Surgical source control in combination with intraoperative lavage is sufficient in most of the patients with diffuse peritonitis.	0.7808007701318024
Native Tissue Harmonic Imaging is a new way of ultrasound image processing that addresses the difficult-to-image patient.	0.4756199854361654
By using a Gaussian shaped transmit pulse it is possible to separate from the returning echo the harmonic component without overlapping with fundamental reflections.	0.42767650492463083
The improved image quality leads to higher diagnostic confidence so that the use of further imaging modalitites is unnecessary.	0.4287665987282832
Aim: The aim of this study was to validate the detection of calcified arteriosclerotic plaques with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS).	0.48924564490630856
Method: 181 arteries were examined by 20/30 MHz IVUS.	0.4657608545987671
The ultrasound cross-sections were compared to the corresponding radiologic (30 kV) and histologic cross-sections.	0.7552482816805809
Results: Calcified lesions were imaged as bright echos with shadowing.	0.34582611450545164
In 13 cases of 161 calcified lesions were too small to detect by IVUS.	0.5317829722309583
In 5 ultrasonic sections the diagnosis "calcified lesion" could not be verified neither by radiology nor by histology.	0.4575150187994098
The sensitivity was 91.6%, the specificity was 94.7% and the accuracy was 93.0%.	0.7821927049415381
Conclusions: Because of the acoustic properties of calcium, calcified lesions can be detected accurately by IVUS.	0.5658981344533275
IVUS can generate new insights into the effect of plaque composition on the response to catheter therapies.	0.45726808247487405

It was the aim of weekly conferences, held in Israel in 1994 and 1996, to explore its repercussions on current behaviour.	0.5447933865322248
The topic was "The past in the present".	0.7639566267539236
The participants were Israelis and Germans, the staff international.	0.4336326624774747
The method used was the application of the "group relations conference", specially devised for these conferences.	0.47488717107819195
The leadership was in the hands of Eric J. Miller, director of the group relations program at the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations in London, where this group method originated and continues to be particularly cultivated still today.	0.49909960539196274
It is especially suited when an unconscious conflict between subgroups exists that emerges on the surface in forms which lead to confusion and misunderstandings.	0.4555168191350942
The task which had been put to the participants was as follows: to explore how feelings and fantasies influence relations within and between the two groups.	0.5650786400146712
This was easy to remember but not always easy to adhere to.	0.4544342294001928
There were moments when fantasy and reality got confused, accompanied by intense feelings.	0.2535255487441531
In this paper my experience with a databank for cases with bone diseases is reported.	0.5966552442660606
All cases which had been diagnosed in the newly formed Department of Bone Pathology of the University of Hamburg since 1970 were registered in uniform fashion.	0.6399107817561103
Adapting the system to state-of-the-art network structures required a lot of personal and financial investment.	0.41657811960391444
This could not be accomplished by university resources alone, but only in cooperation with other research funds.	0.6987869979328896
Now 76 000 cases can be routinely accessed and scientifically analysed.	0.2795982705137469
Background and purpose: In Germany, 750,000 children are born per year who should be screened for developmental visual defects in the age range 24-48 months.	0.5176792591747938
However, the established pediatric screening program is not sufficient to prevent amblyopia.	0.6885653728172378
The purpose of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of alternatives for amblyopia and microtropia screening.	0.5417176510577592
The fluorescence diagnosis based on the aminolavulinic acid-stimulated porphyrin synthesis allows the detection of superficial tumors in a very early stage even when they are very small tumors.	0.5086479394659087
A fluorescence diagnosis of tumors in the oral cavity can be simply performed by rinsing with a 0.4% ALA solution for 20 min.	0.5465567498588647
This topical application avoids systemic side effects such as skin sensitization.	0.31933316525986455
The red fluorescent areas are visible to the naked eye; only a blue light source for fluorescence excitation is necessary and a suitable red filter for observation.	0.5145993735856974
In our study on 56 patients suffering from carcinoma of the oral cavity, 96% of the histologically confirmed carcinoma could be visualized via fluorescence.	0.612310430491704
In 3 patients additional tumors were detected via fluorescence that were not visible otherwise.	0.48213094159510445
However, many patients show fluorescent areas with no correlation to the histological finding.	0.6340261621924851
It was verified that bacteria from the oral cavity also produce PpIX after ALA incubation, which leads to false-positive findings.	0.5366944257736644
Reduction of the false-positive findings was achieved by rinsing the oral cavity with hydrogen peroxide and by mechanical plaque reduction.	0.6038176080063069
This improves the reliability of a fluorescence-guided biopsy.	0.4032113741505382
However, suppression of the bacteria fluorescence is necessary for clinical use of this diagnostic method.	0.7782518226513608
Autocapture is a newly developed automatic threshold tracking algorithm implemented in implantable pacemakers.	0.3529544948640196
Based on the detection of the cardiac evoked response, autocapture continuously controls the effectiveness of stimulation.	0.628459426531548
Increases in threshold are immediately followed by an adaption of the pulse amplitude.	0.41303287526668525
Automatic threshold tests periodically lower the amplitude in order to adapt to decreased thresholds.	0.3515684893563471
Thus, changes in threshold can be monitored over a long period and utilized as a diagnostic tool.	0.5855376495477003
This case report demonstrates the diagnosis and monitoring of a microdislodgement by means of autocapture.	0.7135750803079511

The proof of histotypical function after implantation in vivo is essential.	0.3523928714343894
The use of autologous cells and tissue engineering methods offers the possibility to overcome the disadvantages of classical tissue reconstruction - donor site morbidity of autologous grafts, immunogenicity of allogenic grafts and loosening of alloplastic implants.	0.555284179354796
Furthermore, tissue engineering widens the spectrum of surgical indications in bone and cartilage reconstruction.	0.5739770544224346
The purpose of this paper is to present principle and technique of proximal lateral column lengthening by calcaneal osteotomy and to critically analyze our preliminary results.	0.5520094999806289
16 patients (7 female, 9 male; average age 52.3 years [24-72 years]) were treated for stage II to III posterior tibial tendon insufficiency by calcaneal osteotomy and medial soft tissue reconstruction (tendon reconstruction, 15; tendon transfer, 8; deltoid ligament repair, 10).	0.7260823576174066
When the AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot Rating Scale was applied, these patients were shown to have significantly increased their scores from an average preoperative value of 49.1 to a mean postoperative value of 91.1 after a mean follow-up of 24.6 months.	0.7117835999563517
In all but one case no loss of achieved foot correction was noted.	0.3807381259578014
In one case, a fusion of the calcaneocuboid joint had to be performed after 5 months due to painful degenerative joint disease.	0.7548427438704581
At follow-up, all patients had satisfactory restoration of their medial longitudinal arch, reduction of forefoot abduction, and restored arch height.	0.6679447819308604
All patients were able to fully weight-bear the operated foot, and all patients were satisfied with the achieved result.	0.6338745068018019
In the pes planovalgus deformity occurring in stage II to III (as significant degenerative joint disease has not already occurred), osteotomies appear to have a significant role in the operative management and to function by restoring more normal biomechanics, thus allowing tendon reconstruction and tendon transfers to return to successfull function.	0.6267455131227816
By the update of §24 a of the German road traffic act driving under the influence of drugs of abuse can now be fined even in absence of an actual driving impairment.	0.475651821552982
The only requisite is the detection of certain drugs/metabolites in a blood sample.	0.5019646999961465
Therefore for pretesting there is a need for fast and reliable immunological screening methods in blood/serum.	0.4379325704126443
The new Mahsan microtiterplate enzyme immunoassay (MTP-EIA) is claimed to be sensitive and independent of the matrix.	0.5650515159054538
For an evaluation we carried out a comparison of the cannabinoid and opiate assays from Mahsan (MTP-EIA) and the routinely used Abbott fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) with a batch of routine serum samples.	0.5900012821425156
For the MTP-EIAs we used the cut-off recommendations of the supplier (cannabinoids 2 ng/mL, opiates 10 ng/mL).	0.48659213841964777
For the Abbott FPIAs the serum samples had to be pretreated (deproteinization with acetone) and appropriate cut-offs were defined by our investigations (cannabinoids 20 ng/mL, opiates 30 ng/mL).	0.505069694020283
Out of 136 samples screened for cannabinoids 42% were positive with GC-MS and 18% from 123 samples were positive for opiates.	0.6071323765942348
The Abbott cannabinoid FPIA gave false negative results in 23% of GC-MS positive cases and 9% false negatives for opiates while Mahsan MTP-EIA gave no false negatives.	0.5090562417515653
Each of the two cannabinoid assays gave false positive results in 13% of the cases and for the MTP opiate assay 2% of the positives could not be confirmed with GC-MS. As a result of our study the cut-off values for the MTP-EIAs have proved to be suitable for a distinction between potential positives and true negatives.	0.802208267161983
Systemic karyomegaly associated with interstitial nephritis was first described in 1978 by Mihatsch.	0.36452476265025113
Seven cases have been reported to date.	0.7782296193006184
We give an account of an autopsy case of systemic karyomegaly in a 30-year-old Italian man.	0.4713835699523049
Bizarre enlargement of nuclei was found in renal tubular epithelial cells, Schwann cells and in smooth muscle cells of vessels and bowel and, less obviously, in endothelial and adventitial cells of vessels, in alveolar epithelial cells and in astrocytes of the brain.	0.7117471117485293
These findings were associated with chronic interstitial nephritis, nonspecific hepatopathy, adenocarcinoma of the rectum and multiple slerosis.	0.6713389545445354
The clinical course was marked by chronic renal failure, chronic haemodialysis and renal transplantation.	0.7246001757102672
The patient died 8 years after diagnosis in septic-toxic shock.	0.7166173691384004
The aetiology and pathogenesis of the disease are discussed.	0.8710127668204309
17% of malignant melanomas (n=100) investigated in a dermatologic practice were less than 6 mm in maximal diameter (median diameter: 4.0 +/- 0.9 mm).	0.7545590726302908
The median age of the 17 patients at diagnosis of small-diameter melanomas was 42 years.	0.6923178545125427
The essential epiluminescence microscopic and histopatologic features of these small melanomas resembled those of larger lesions, although their clinical criteria differed from the classic ABCDs.	0.534402493623047
6 (35,3%) of the small melanomas were were found to be in situ.	0.9378796711980454
This percentage was nearly similar to those in situ lesions within the group of melanomas of 6 mm in diameter or larger (38,3%).	0.5874542104848859
The remaining 11 small lesions were classified as invasive from Clark's level I to V, including all classic histogenetic types (superficial spreading, nodular, unclassified, desmoplastic).	0.4592827980680137
The median thickness of the small invasive melanomas was 0,76 +/- 0,23 mm.	0.6670269788869836
7 small melanomas had apparent histologic remnants of a melanocytic nevus.	0.2768032862993835
Epiluminescence microscopic features of the melanomas were evaluated and statistically compared with those of 100 dysplastic nevi and 50 spindle cell nevi.	0.4778715097664173
The technique of epiluminescence microscopy allowed the identification of such malignant melanomas that could not be discerned by the naked eye or by a pocket-lens.	0.5067526251228289
Mycobacterium gordonae is an atypical mycobacterium of very low pathogenic potential.	0.3057573097699611
It is widely distributed in soil and water and often detected on the mucous membranes of healthy persons.	0.3602902002442282
In recent years, there have been numerous reports of infections by M. gordonae in immunocompromised patients.	0.5922975648970501
In contrast, only four cases of skin infections by M. gordonae in immunocompetent patients have been published.	0.6592849854931169
We report on another patient without evidence of immunodeficiency who developed an atypical mycobacteriosis after a thorn injury during gardening.	0.5283949470158502
M. gordonae was isolated by tissue culture.	0.4410867558252504
The skin lesion cleared completely after treatment with doxycycline for three months.	0.43872687258169274
The article gives a review on oncocytic metaplasia and oncocytic tumors.	0.39137805350491606
Biochemical, cytochemical and molecular genetic findings are discussed.	0.35103063819668867
It has been established, that defects of the respiratory chain occur predominantly in oncocytic foci of the parathyroids and the liver.	0.6967444064290139
The underlying molecular genetic mechanisms are still unclear, however.	0.6650079152535676
In particular, one has to assume that oncocytic metaplasia differs pathogenetically from oncocytic neoplasia.	0.431663490935559
Furthermore, organ-dependent prognostic differences of oncocytic tumors exist.	0.45490930880200303
Oncocytic carcinomas are predominantly seen in the thyroid and are scarce in other organs.	0.541912624464998
The molecular genetic basis of this phenomenon is, however, still unknown.	0.6625856992931138
The authors describe the feasibility of developing receptor-specific MR contrast agents for the improved detection of pathology and assessment of organ function.	0.5099552701797596
Receptor specificity of MR contrast agents can be achieved by binding of receptor-specific carriers to ligands.	0.5822540672662245
This concept leads towards a decrease in dose and thus in toxicity.	0.422233322180227
Specific attachment to parenchymal cells improves tumor-organ contrast and therefore tumor detection.	0.3072813107593186
Specific uptake mechanisms also enable the assessment of organ function.	0.2936014893582146
Future design concepts of novel MR contrast agents may consider the desired uptake in specific cells or organs (ovaries, adrenal glands, lymph nodes etc.)	0.42439027430626214
with subsequent synthesis of appropriate carriers.	0.2931815718206708
Elastosis perforans serpiginosa can arise as a rare complication in patients with Down syndrome.	0.5019100969603235
It is one of the primary perforating disorders characterized by transepithelial elimination of abnormal elastic fibers.	0.4655292756121982
This may reflect an immunological reaction aquist elastic fibers.	0.2603797528130841
We describe a 40-year-old woman with Down's syndrome whose skin lesions were histologically mistaken for lupus vulgaris for a long time.	0.5161374385741065
The position of the talus and the os calcaneum has consequences for the architecture of the forefoot.	0.620121392952519
Medial tilting of the talus with vertical position provokes flattening of the medial arch and abduction of the forefoot.	0.583684040887262
Varus position of the calcis and lateral direction of the talus (as in residual clubfoot), however, causes supination and adduction of the forefoot.	0.6143963454010146
Repair of deformities in the hindfoot therefore also influences the forefoot.	0.3359809095459971
A large number of various osteotomies have been proposed at both bones.	0.4119970753387729
The most popular ones are Dwyer's osteotomy at the corpus of the calcis and its modification described by Mitchell at the same location for correction of the cavus foot and the residual clubfoot, and the lengthening osteotomy at the neck of the calcaneum according to Evans.	0.5624782282045997
Indication and operative technique of these three procedures are described in detail.	0.7194804446765402
The closing wedge osteotomy according to Dwyer is indicated in cases of cavus feet.	0.40950713243516257
In clubfeet the os calcis is usually too short and the medial opening wedge osteotomy provokes skin problems.	0.38769623043298335
In these cases an osteotomy according to Mitchell with lateral displacement of the tuber calcanei is more suitable.	0.5018043061257904
In flat- and skewfeet a lengthening osteotomy at the neck of the calcaneum according to Evans can be indicated, especially when the load of the foot is bigger medially under the talus rather than at the lateral margin of the foot.	0.6490995858221027
If these procedures are carried out carefully, they have low complications rates.	0.5262016336454743
Between January 1994 and August 1998, 12 patients with 13 chronic infections after resection arthroplasty were treated successfully with vastus lateralis muscleflap.	0.5217482158357465
One patient was suffering from chronic infection on both sides.	0.5758339715387368
In all cases we found the infected cavity to be the origin of the persistent infection.	0.8820247086817213
The average duration of infection was 8.3 months.	0.6668580282982021
The patients had undergone an average of 3.8 operations.	0.9394702012166021
Up to now there was no recurrent infection, controlled by clinical investigation, ultrasound and laboratory findings in all 13 cases.	0.7759975691383804
Follow up investigation occured 2.5 years (1.5-4.7) after flap transfer.	0.9416794175954197
The flap is easy to harvest.	0.2881674173930115
He has a very constant pattern of vascular pedicle and a wide arc of rotation.	0.4226501068254683
The functional deficits of donor side morbidity are minimal.	0.40576847861670906
That vastus lateralis flap seems to be an ideal procedure to stop draining infections due to infected cavities in the hip region.	0.5337941142753723
Information technologies have been integrated in gynecological oncology treatment and, therefore, new software has been established in hospitals and private clinics.	0.5861668895436508
A German law for hospital tumor registration has attempted to unify the different strategies.	0.33109832433284997
All intentions to establish new documentation systems for tumor diseases need a standardized basic data set.	0.3310416057373874
Nevertheless, local governmental health organizations are not yet prepared to implement a global information system such as prenatal and perinatal care databases.	0.4930175501341541
Financial support and political work is therefore needed.	0.3410860677743406
To optimise the microsurgical training in our clinic we organized a permanent possibility to practice microsurgical techniques of vascular anastomosis.	0.43149612189518144
This includes stepwise education by means of plastic materials, human placenta and the rat model.	0.45974043344109866
The most important role in this concept is played by the placenta.	0.7615538405345788
It supplies a realistic simulation of different in vivo situations concerning microvascular anastomosis.	0.30419482514006047
As to availability, handling and costs the placenta is superior to animal models and has replaced them almost completely in our educational concept.	0.43382123313779836
Since Manfred Bleuler's description of the clinical picture of late onset schizophrenia over 50 years ago, debate has persisted as to whether it is justifiable to differentiate this as a valid, independent entity from the group of classic schizophrenic disorders with early onset.	0.6387029160652272
As this review shows, this question cannot be answered unequivocally even now.	0.5501073864061151
It must rather be remarked that we have neither been able to decisively extend our knowledge since Manfred Bleuler's comprehensive contribution, nor managed to achieve a much sounder basis methodologically.	0.42575032493708176
The reasons for this are the international conceptual and terminological confusion that has developed around this illness group, and on the other hand the methodological limitations of the empirical studies conducted on this clinical picture so far.	0.617378898756707
Definition of the problem: In parallel with public and philosophical discussions, there is an ongoing debate about euthanasia in theological ethics.	0.5688600178081628
In this situation it is helpful to provide a systematic overview of the different arguments and judgements.	0.7022693247848556
Arguments: A short introduction is followed by a first part dealing with the definition of terms.	0.7632697175627827
The second and major part concerning normative arguments is subdivided into three steps: the level of principles, the more concrete level of actions and finally the level of social consequences.	0.6174129055253622
The third part presents some reflections following the eudaimonistic ethical tradition (the ethics of a good life and death) focusing on the central question: how to find meaning in life when faced with suffering.	0.5382161631506108
Conclusion: It would be fruitful to intensify the ethical reflection both on the problems concerning the foundations of social life, especially the meaning of dignity, autonomy and inviolability of human life, and social consequences of a liberal practice of euthanasia.	0.6005062917626279
In this context ethicists are challenged to reflect on the different approaches to what is or can be a good life and a human death.	0.5603688973835527
Multimodal therapy of oral squamous cell carcinomas today is based on surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.	0.6248867211528428
Despite the combination of all three therapeutic options, there is still a large number of treatment failures and therefore major questions remain.	0.6102014250017603
Recent investigations suggest that mutations of the p53 tumor supressor gene may account for some of the therapeutic failures.	0.5530939948632014
Inactivation of the gene may be an  important determinant of the efficiacy of today's multimodal therapy protocols.	0.5082546405334308
In 90 patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity biopsy specimens were taken before and after preoperative radiochemotherapy.	0.5933235397947793
From all patients, biopsy and resection material was available for immunohistochemical analysis of p53.	0.4528838068128568
After radiation treatment, 51 patients (57%) showed a complete response; 39 patients (43%) only showed a partial response or did not respond at all.	0.7923969235210854
Among the responders, 82% of the pretherapeutic tumors were p53 positive, whereas among the nonresponders only 56% of the pretherapeutic tumors were p53 positive.	0.5920829613593772
The majority of the residual tumors were also p53 negative according to immunohistology after radiation treatment.	0.48371978705366664
In our study, detection of p53 protein by immunohistochemistry seemed to be connected with a more radiosensitive reaction of the tumors.	0.6397455660822347
Nevertheless, successful strategies for radiation therapy may need to take into account the tissue of origin and the status of p53 in the tumor.	0.6915837114428766
The human cartilage and bone is characterized by a remodeling during the life, well balanced by neosynthesis and degradation of matrix components.	0.5607008572095694
In different joint diseases, it becomes imbalanced and the destruction of the cartilage supersedes the repair.	0.6123717617039988
In tissue processes in disease and in normal turnover of the matrix, these molecules are fragmented and released into surrounding fluids, in the synovial fluid, and then in the blood and the urin, where they can be detected.	0.7882305459630291
The quantitative measurement in the synovial fluid is more specific than in the other body fluids.	0.6525376228883711
The research process in recent years has suggested that these molecular markers of cartilage and bone matrix metabolism can be used to determine diagnosis, the disease severity rather than its presence or absence, the prognosis, and the response to therapy.	0.8258202209427555
They should help to identify the disease mechanism in different joint diseases not only on the tissue but also on the molecular level.	0.6408290129386008
The specific cartilage matrix markers promise to become useful tools in the future in clinical use.	0.5823733864371723
The research in this area is still in the early stages, with most results dated from the end of the 1980s and the 1990s.	0.7730433754878353
Axillary block is a common anaesthetic technique for operations on the hand and forearm.	0.6706838428205089
In our hospital, with many trainees in anaesthesia, only 250 - 300 axillary blocks per year are performed by about 30 colleagues.	0.7316745986802985
This implies a small number of blocks for each anaesthetist.	0.3548968780840958
The present study was designed to assess whether it is possible to teach this technique and use it with an adequate degree of success under these conditions.	0.6719028160217625
We used a nerve stimulator and studied whether the success of the block under these conditions is independent of anaesthetist's experience in this technique.	0.5677596997455066
Furthermore, we examined other factors involved in the success of the block.	0.8728367024590716
The study included 112 patients subjected to elective surgery of the upper extremity; all received an axillary block.	0.6386984699342848
We used a nerve stimulator and injected mepivacaine 1% without adrenaline.	0.4420439015908119
The following parameters were recorded: the number of blocks to date performed by the anaesthetist; the minimal current required for nerve stimulation; the dose of local anaesthetic; the time between the end of injection and the beginning of surgery; the duration of surgery; and the quality of sensory and motor blockade after 10, 20, and 30 min.	0.8434089976481232
Sensory blockade was assessed by the pinprick method (no blockade, analgesia, anaesthesia); motor blockade was judged by comparing the muscle strength of both arms (no blockade, paresis, paralysis).	0.5499565935675241
Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test, with P<0.05 considered statistically significant.	0.6645450372718901
Of the 112 blocks, 95 (85%) were successful; 17 (15%) failed and the patients required general anaesthesia.	0.7613443856444533
Eight of the successful blocks showed a decrease in analgesic quality after >=70 min and required additional analgesics or general anaesthesia.	0.4582632298546961
We found no correlation between the experience of the anaesthetist and the success of the block.	0.6998116647258018
The minimal required current for nerve stimulation in the success group was 0.4 mA and differed significantly from the value of 0.6 mA in the failure group (Table 3).	0.6392908876421018
The dose of mepivacaine was higher in the success group (5.9 vs. 5.3 mg/kg).	0.9045776061804537
Complete sensory blockade was more frequently achieved for the median, ulnar, and radial nerves than for the musculocutaneous and cutaneous brachii medialis (Fig.	0.4865725836564411
The frequency of complete sensory blockade (anaesthesia) had increased by 21.9% between the 20th and 30th min.	0.6405090414966215
Complete motor blockade was less often achieved than sensory blockade (Fig.	0.3263052766901092
Using the method of electrostimulation, the axillary block is an appropriate anaesthetic technique that can be applied in a hospital where each anaesthetist only occasionally performs it.	0.7529831801095433
Prior to injection of the local anaesthetic, the current for nerve stimulation should be reduced to <0.5 mA.	0.8749262913376568
The time between the end of injection and the beginning of surgery should be no less than 30 min because complete sensory blockade can more often be achieved.	0.5049393396625019
The dose of mepivacaine should be no less than 6 mg/kg body weight.	0.5686833826030974
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was discovered 10 years ago as a growth factor that can regulate angiogenesis and in addition the permeability of blood vessels.	0.6150125341735919
Numerous studies have revealed that it is essential for normal embryonic development and that it plays a major role in physiological and pathological events of angiogenesis in adults.	0.6585788567668248
