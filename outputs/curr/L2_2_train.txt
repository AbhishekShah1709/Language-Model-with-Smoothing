Regarding the first point, we say quite clearly that, in order to take into consideration the requirements of sustainable development which the European Union has endorsed, it is essential that, in some instances, there is state aid to businesses, be it in the form of tax exemptions, special taxation or even direct aid.	1.0475926837329206
It is also legitimate for there to be inter-company agreements and voluntary restraint agreements, since all these agreements make it possible to reduce the detrimental effects of competition on social or ecological requirements.	0.7256934822560521
So our clear response is that, yes, such aid and such agreements are legitimate, but we say that every single one of these agreements must be expressly justified.	0.8668701300774496
The von Wogau report proposes referring supervision of the legitimacy of individual cases to national level.	0.47248258089403417
We feel this is relatively dangerous, but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because we recognise that the Commission cannot do everything.	1.0492682988798299
We demand that the greatest possible transparency should be in place and that greater powers of investigation be granted to the Commission in order to check the legitimacy of such exceptions after the fact.	0.825602801331412
Mr President, once again we are debating the European Union' s competition policy.	0.8207047732071828
But let us stop to consider the circumstances in which this debate is taking place and the conclusions to which it should bring us.	0.8624121188063034
The overriding features of today' s economy are massive mergers and acquisitions involving huge companies with a market monopoly and the emergence of frighteningly powerful multinational groups.	0.47390949938744575
Should we not be discussing this issue?	0.559341817218271
We need a competition policy which can and will introduce controls on the activities of these private-sector monopolies.	0.6705816138646215
Certain sectors of European industry, such as the shipbuilding industry, air transport and the steel industry, which have been hard hit by existing competition policy, have suffered tremendously.	0.7923949881115725
They have lost their status, and a significant slice of the world market and hundreds of thousands of workers have been made redundant.	0.9850074427513594
When will we debate that?	0.38112156123530866
The scandalous concentration of power in sectors of strategic importance is giving speculative multinational groups economies the size of entire states, and Member States of the Union at that.	0.733965909953913
And yet, we keep on weakening the public sector and we are ready and willing to tighten competition policy yet further by qualifying public procurement contracts placed with public-sector corporations as state aid.	0.6496378003427832
At the same time, unemployment is spiralling as a result of the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.	0.5412869220011922
Workers are facing a massive attack on their employment and social rights.	0.6346839179379331
Consumers see their standard of living being eroded, poverty spreading and the public sector and production base in most countries in the Union being dismantled and dissolved in the name of unadulterated and catastrophic competition, in the name of the absolute market economy and the promotion of the monopolistic interests of big business.	0.6857185293316805
We consider the competition policy to be responsible for all this and are totally opposed to it.	0.8006361141709726
Mr President, Commissioner, in the course of this pivotal year, prior to the changeover to the single currency, the Commission has deployed every effort to ensure the birth of the euro in a favourable environment.	0.9381622585279097
The competition policy has, as far as these resources permitted, contributed to this event.	0.8194008973326007
For our part, we remain staunchly opposed to the single currency which, far from bringing us the advantages and flexibility of a shared currency, imprisons us in an artificial straitjacket, which has been imposed on the peoples of Europe.	0.7706961043813814
Having said that, governing means planning. It also means being responsible and, in this new context which has been forced upon us, competition law naturally has an essential role to play.	0.9301649338164493
In this area, the Commission has given priority to a number of routes of action: acting on the structure of markets by actively combating anti-competitive practices, by refocusing its departments' supervisory activities only upon matters with a manifest Community interest and by affirming its intention to modernise competition law.	0.6323829866846981
As regards state aid, it is essential to ensure that regulations are not made more complex, and the introduction of a public register, where all aid would be recorded, does not seem advisable to us since this onerous commitment would quite naturally run counter to the attempts to simplify bureaucratic constraints.	0.752030894097751
Finally, on the subject of modernising the implementation of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty, we do not think that decentralised application would necessarily be going in the right direction.	0.7030730939924498
The Commission is, in fact, retaining not only the power to take matters out of the jurisdiction of national authorities, but clearly obliging the national jurisdictions to avoid disputing the decisions of the Commission at all.	0.8697276808678065
National states would thus become the secular arm of the Commission regarding observance of the application of rules which they do not control.	0.705493298707696
In conclusion, I would say that while some measures are heading in the right direction, we shall of course remain vigilant in order to prevent the snowballing of Federalism which, if it were realised, would be to the detriment of Europe and the sovereignty of the states.	0.972458444183155
Mr President, Commissioner, we have a basically positive view of the Commission' s White Paper on competition, particularly as regards the abolition of the system of notification and authorisation, but we are also puzzled by several things.	0.9841600154593094
First of all, there is a risk that the decentralisation of powers, though necessary in many ways, will cause an abnormal increase in competition-related initiatives, and that some people will be tempted to use competition law, not as a means to be resorted to when all else fails, of ensuring the smooth and predictable functioning of the markets, but for the purposes of as an instrument for economic and industrial policy, planning and interference with the natural workings of the markets themselves, or even for protectionist purposes.	0.8969037079949447
In this respect, we should heed the words of von Eieck, and doubtless also those of the great Italian liberal Bruno Leoni, who warned precisely against the risks of an abnormal increase in anti-competition policies.	0.7714775014388263
State interference in the economy is, even today, still to blame for the most serious hindrances placed in the way of the market, competition and freedom of choice for European users and consumers.	1.0258943914110696
There is State aid for businesses - we have already discussed this, there is still a strong public presence in the economy - it is estimated that the Italian Treasury controls 15% of stock exchange capitalisation; governments and central banks place obstacles in the way of mergers and acquisitions; and there has been much talk in recent weeks about Vodafone' s bid for Mannesmann and the bailout of Holzmann.	0.8082169644815136
Finally, Commissioner, we cannot forget that large sections of the economy are still firmly in the hands of the state, ranging from state television, which is funded on a mandatory basis by the taxpayer, and the Post Office, to some compulsory insurance schemes, including health and social welfare systems, which are managed by inefficient state monopolies which leave no-one but the wealthy user with any other option.	0.8684892418120813
Commissioner, I am quite familiar with the constraints imposed by the Treaties, but I believe that, it must be emphasised once again that the European economy is finding it hard to compete with the American economy, especially because of insufficiently open markets and a lack of genuine competition.	0.9684443342366543
What is being done may well be very important, but it is still not sufficient.	1.040079415633131
Mr President, a White Paper, by definition, is not something you can take or leave.	1.0134787575354502
It is there to generate reactions and the White Paper has certainly succeeded in doing that.	0.49841061782037316
It forms a sound basis for discussion and is to be welcomed in this sense.	0.8102192478346992
I understand where the authors are coming from and I share their views.	0.47986624278413886
I also assume that you, Commissioner, want to honour the reputation of, and the work put in by, your predecessors and that your offices will pursue the same objective.	0.7177523430254233
I cannot imagine the Commission taking initiatives in order to de-Europeanise or re-nationalise in a thorough manner, but I have my concerns and questions nevertheless.	0.6658660144368186
Firstly, these relate to the coherence of the policy' s application.	0.9291896246389907
In general, I am a great defender of cultural diversity but not in terms of competitiveness within the internal market.	0.8143588015955091
The internal market needs a uniform competition policy, not only in terms of concept, but also in terms of application.	0.8036628158179195
It is true, there are some European regulations and interpretative statements on the way.	0.8322079424726047
The Commission is also said to have the right of evocation and can give guidelines to the national competition authorities.	0.9823264404005307
But I still wonder if we do not run the risk of ending up in a kind of Echternach procession where we will have to take one step back before we are able to take two steps forward.	0.6458748791234695
So, I would like to hear more about how the Commission will guarantee this uniform application in practice and whether you yourself consider the courses outlined from point one hundred onwards in the White Paper to be feasible.	0.6848947900120406
Secondly, I understand the worry of industry regarding legal certainty.	0.8736103354899112
Many dossiers are currently being filed with precisely this concern.	0.3644290900777029
This instrument will fall by the wayside in future.	0.2995235810251395
In the White Paper, you state that the Commission will still issue particular orders which can be used as guidelines, but what will your criteria be for granting such orders one day but not the next?	0.9288717493533011
Thirdly, I would like to know whether the Commission has looked into the effects its new approach will have on industrial strategy.	0.7790042295911114
I have particular concerns regarding the fate of SMEs which will lose part of their legal and financial protection, as is already the case, one has got to admit, within the new vertical group exemption for the distribution sector.	0.7263342644358306
Fourthly, I would like to be informed of why the Commission does not choose to apply the invalidity penalty in the case of evident infringements of the competition rules.	0.7944742096961486
Fifthly, with the pending enlargement, I wonder whether the candidate counties will be able to play our game.	0.7950688307848679
They are still in training, as it were.	1.0273445683567652
What guarantees do we have that they will grow into first-class players in the league of the internal market?	0.659208540161761
Sixthly and lastly, I would remind you of a point that I have already raised in my report on vertical restrictions, namely the legal privilege of company lawyers.	0.9716223814100495
If the Commission implements the White Paper objectives, it seems to me that discrimination within the internal market and between external and internal legal advisers will become more pronounced and hence even less acceptable.	0.7549027893866112
Is the Commission considering taking any action to allow in-house lawyers in all Member States legal privilege?	0.5913068710283438
Commissioner, I am asking these questions as a defender of the internal market and I hope that, in this sense, we are all partners and that the discussion between these partners does not remain sterile but can bear fruit.	0.9519303347930245
Mr President, I would like, in beginning my speech regarding the White Paper, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr von Wogau.	0.9690846950513395
The fact that the Group of the Party of European Socialists is very much in agreement with your report is clearly demonstrated by the fact that only one amendment has been presented during this procedure.	0.8163596944738323
We are, therefore, in agreement with the report, Commissioner, as well as the broad outlines of the White Paper.	0.7613977272591352
Since the Treaty entered into force, Community law on competition has been one of the tenets of Community policy.	0.6966146056196174
After almost forty years of being in force, these rules were beginning to show signs of exhaustion. For this reason, modernisation was essential.	0.6984595170458825
That modernisation came to be particularly necessary for five reasons. Firstly, the authorisation system; secondly, decentralised application; thirdly, procedural rules; fourthly, judicial application; and fifthly and finally, excessive red tape.	0.5926560210354546
The system of individual approvals needed urgent reform, as was unanimously requested by specialised companies, academics and lawyers.	0.6764833767064965
I have not attended a single forum of specialists in competition law which has not requested a change to the system.	0.6445333813500205
A system, such as the current one, which is capable of making so few decisions, be they approvals or prohibitions, is something less than a valid system.	0.8201541168450148
National competition authorities were able to apply Articles 81(1) and 82 for some time.	0.6464647471044837
However, they could not apply Article 81(3), which, to a certain extent, prevented the coherent application of Article 81(1).	0.8267831636528101
You will know that there are currently two preliminary issues before the Court of Justice, both brought by German courts, which question the feasibility of applying 81(1) without being able to apply 81(3).	0.7122207513411318
A reform of this point was therefore also necessary.	0.5797826965853816
The procedure in the field of competition is basically contained in Regulation 1762.	0.45193237378722567
The voices in favour of its amendment were unanimous.	0.3955388688014588
The fact that it did not establish a genuine procedure, that it did not establish time limits, that it did not regulate access for interested parties to the files, or that the right to defence was not properly recognised, were factors which led to the unanimous demand for reform.	0.955433744516942
The Court of Justice accepted some time ago that Community competition law could be applied by the legal bodies of the Member States and in 1994, the Commission published a communication on this subject.	0.9046871129173055
It was therefore necessary to facilitate this approach.	0.3272396487486248
One of the most frequent criticisms of Community competition law is its excessive red tape.	0.6733969181501529
As a consequence of the continental legal tradition, consideration of whether certain agreements are anti-competitive or not depends more on an analysis of their clauses than on their effects on the market.	0.5776527528554152
It was therefore necessary to introduce an economic analysis.	0.4434231332404065
The White Paper intends to resolve these problems and we therefore support these proposals.	0.758815121550768
It is also true that we note certain deficiencies which have come to light in the report.	0.8005901850281493
Amongst these, firstly, is the fact that, despite trying to modernise Articles 81 and 82, Article 81 and not Article 82 carries exclusive weight.	0.7976618448904004
At the moment, with inter-company agreements and the privatisation of monopolies preserving dominant positions and even consolidating them, the combating of abusive conduct is becoming particularly important.	0.6026340924782603
Secondly, Regulation 1762 must be repealed and replaced with a new regulation.	0.5940972576834656
For these reasons, we are going to vote in favour of the report.	0.8485654187446526
However, if some of the amendments are accepted, particularly those presented by the PPE-DE Group, we would consider the report to be stripped of its value and to have become an inconsistent document, lacking in rigour and, in that event, we would reconsider our support.	1.053683126763519
Mr President, amongst the various issues being dealt with in this joint debate, I would like to comment on the one mentioned by Mr Berenguer, that is to say, the modernisation of competition policy, which is the subject of the Commission' s White Paper.	0.9997697255131691
Frankly, I believe that this modernisation has been satisfactory.	0.84156204746073
Through his management, Commissioner Monti achieves good results, as did his predecessor and, clearly, he has established a guarantee which, in parallel with the creation and development of the European internal market, has been capable of establishing the corresponding corrective measures so that the market economy within the Union may work adequately, without the distortions which we economists know may arise when the market is enlarged, as has happened in the European Union since 1993.	1.0031349915410563
If it functions well, if we are satisfied, if the Commission has basically acted correctly, why the need for the modification?	1.0655187204983807
Various arguments have been presented in its favour.	0.6344833121997748
Mr Berenguer made a very accurate analysis, justifying the need and the relevant reforms for improving the dynamics of competition, but my concern is to ensure that the standards and criteria which will be applied through the corresponding administrations in the Member States, are truly identical in all regions.	0.7554964641982167
Because, if this is not the case, we will be faced with the paradox that the Commission itself will introduce elements of unfair competition into the functioning of the European internal market.	1.1301523568961573
In that event we would not have moved forward, but rather backwards, in the application of competition policy in the Union.	1.1233484219421543
Mr President, I would like firstly to express my appreciation to the Commission for the improvement represented by the XXVIIIth report on competition policy in the Union, when compared to previous reports.	0.9231067931216946
I would also like to highlight the work carried out by the rapporteur, Mr Rapkay, who has dissected this dense and comprehensive text in such a concise way.	0.7310290226110051
I would also like to fully support his comments on the need to allow the regions - such as the Basque Country, which I represent - a margin for action, by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity.	0.9331141030774925
Nevertheless, I cannot forget the numerous criticisms, both from Member States and from market operators, which, given the broad margin for manoeuvre and discretion enjoyed by the Commission in its evaluation of specific cases, maintain that they suffer from legal insecurity in the absence of clear rules allowing interested parties to anticipate the position of the authorities and thereby make feasible requests for aid aimed at the promotion of economic activity and employment, the planning of company mergers etc.	0.8411534643188915
The only guarantee has been to seek prior favourable approval, through individual cases, which will take more than six or eight months to resolve, an excessively long period, which simply leads to problems of a lack of flexibility, affecting the generation of wealth and employment.	0.7737597840607178
I therefore believe that something is missing and I suggest that we establish more regulations, lay down clear rules, which will benefit all of us: businesspeople, investors, workers and the citizens in general.	0.828553760562679
Mr President, I would like to stress that, in an age of significant technological changes - just look at what is happening in the information technology sector and other sectors such as energy and transport - safeguarding competition will be of fundamental importance for our future.	0.8870001740189671
From the point of view of economic growth, and therefore of increasing employment and wealth, safeguarding a competition policy in the Member States is becoming a crucial factor, and one that is certainly very important for our future.	1.0427794292583248
This is why I give this report my full support.	0.6693877560762735
Recently, I have noticed that the Commission has been working hard to ensure that this principal is respected in a proper and effective manner, precisely in order to safeguard market flexibility, both for products and for services.	0.9919538324847564
I would emphasise that this is going to be extremely important for our future, for Europe' s economy, and, above all, for the protection of our wealth and technological development in Europe in general.	1.006982104419963
Mr President, for British Conservatives the efficient and uniform application of European competition policy is at the core of achieving an effective single market across the whole of the European Union.	0.7808128060417526
It therefore follows that any proposal which suggests major reform of the machinery for competition policy enforcement must be closely and carefully examined.	0.4684831827895404
The truth is that the single market is not yet complete.	0.9269342952629837
During my six months as a Member of this Parliament, I have become acutely aware of the determination of many Members to drive forward what is described as the European project.	0.8970242391769349
We daily hear the need to promote a wider and deeper Europe.	0.6396620110646997
But all this, in effect, is so much rhetoric when we look at the national, regional and local obstacles which continue to block the operation of a true European single market.	0.8357974693553133
That is the context in which I want to consider the Commission's proposals.	1.167955923225715
I should like to make it clear that we have the greatest confidence in and respect for Commissioner Monti.	0.9710298324750731
We look to him as the man to root out cartels.	0.48298846576729604
But he would recognise that, as for everybody else, we have to consider his particular proposals and subject them to rigorous examination. That is something that has been done by our rapporteur on the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mr von Wogau.	0.9925108113638067
I want to congratulate him, sadly in his absence, for the thorough and rigorous way in which he has undertaken the preparation of his report - and also for putting up with my being such a thorn in his side!	0.8901784067555858
He mentioned earlier that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support.	0.6638379895976971
So although I may not share his conclusions, I believe he has illustrated in his report many of the issues which the Commission must address.	1.0457997668949606
The first is the potential for renationalisation of competition policy.	0.6576934345533457
I know that the Commission is set against this, but the potential exists.	1.1587958190247554
I remain worried about the capacity of national courts and the capacity of the national competition authorities.	0.66034400539034
I remain worried about the whole operation of the judicial process.	0.5313232945284285
I asked Commissioner Monti the other day what happens if he proves to be wrong and there is an effective renationalisation.	0.7154059653745921
Mr von Wogau said we can look to the European Court.	0.8447892978572987
Well, we in Britain are looking to the European Court at the moment.	1.183709152816603
We find that the European Court is not able to provide us with interim measures in a certain dispute that we have with France at the moment, in which we have the support of the Commission.	1.1585125725114749
Unless anybody thinks that this is merely a nationalistic point, in the Factortame case, in which the British Government was the defendant, it took ten years for the European Court to give a ruling.	1.0853905134708774
So, judicially, something needs to be done.	0.7243222799022956
I ask the Commission what can be done to speed up implementation in this particular area.	0.9130647236294918
In relation to legal certainty, I endorse the point made by Mrs Thyssen.	0.8566159190453944
It is important that business has legal certainty.	0.4540403281661547
I mentioned this again to Commissioner Monti recently.	0.45863966402654505
He said we must not always be carried along by lawyers.	0.6938105184589696
I must declare an interest as a lawyer but also as a former competition minister in the United Kingdom.	0.7178087705919373
We all have, as it were, our histories to live with, but it is important that business has legal certainty.	0.9272484487828763
I would also ask the Commission whether an analysis has been undertaken of the implications of this change for business: a cost-benefit analysis of the sort that is now becoming so much more European policy.	0.7367677467632272
I know there has been an analysis of the implications for the Commission of the change.	0.9891216371971635
We have been told how, currently, people's time is being wasted and that the changes, therefore, could be beneficial.	0.7800893696719536
But I really feel that, in the circumstances, we want to know what the implications would be for business.	0.9845510127317514
Finally, we, as British Conservatives, are looking for a change in direction, towards the development of an independent competition authority.	1.1078250904780165
I would like to hear what Commissioner Monti has to say about that.	0.6651055653241303
Mr President, the European Union' s competition policy has been of central importance since European integration began.	0.7946362326286214
It is an integral part of the tension, inherent in the very concept of European integration, between solidarity and cooperation between Member States, with a view to creating a better and more efficient environment for the people and the economy, and competition, which should provide incentives to improve the competitiveness and future viability of the European Union as an entity.	0.9619615678777096
It is therefore with some justification that competition policy is one of the most important policies.	0.9976009304069116
We can be proud of a European competition culture, for it is this that will make the social market economy a reality.	0.9939667861714134
We can be proud of monopolies and mergers supervision.	0.46024112485835983
However, we must be vigilant in the face of global operators, against whom nation-states are no longer able to impose limits.	0.8434781802097187
That is why we should bear in mind what was said by the French writer Vivienne Forestier, who described the state of the world in terms of the economy' s reign of terror.	0.9251614680719603
Society is surrendering itself to the economy.	0.49744456953091537
That is precisely what we do not want in the European Union.	0.8975385404969107
We are aware that in this age of strategic alliances and millennium mergers - in 1998 USD 2 400 billion was paid out in connection with take-overs - restrictive practices are being held in check, not just by our own rules but also by bilateral cooperation with the USA or Japan, or others, until we get the international competition law we so badly need.	0.7894436641450009
European competition policy, as we very often forget, is not just important for fair competition as such, but also for prices, growth and employment, and hence for the public.	1.1564512563852247
In common with the other Members, I call for Parliament to have codecision rights where competition law is concerned.	0.8914127958204662
It is essential that this long overdue step be taken.	0.5481385933145329
It is also important to underline the connection between competition policy and consumer protection.	0.8736830512955358
I welcome the fact that Commissioner Monti wants to make progress in this area in the dialogue with the European Parliament, as he does in the dialogue with non-governmental organisations, consumer protection associations and the public.	0.9292839196396341
Greater transparency will also help to achieve public acceptance of decisions relating to competition policy.	0.5479232703103415
Then it is possible to understand that, for example, lower electricity and telecommunications prices are due to European competition policy, and Brussels should not be pilloried when aid decisions are taken which are, of course, bound to cause problems at a particular moment in time or in a local context.	0.6926564198562103
It is particularly important for there to be clarity in relation to competition rules in view of EU enlargement.	0.697357809000249
Emphasis must also be placed on the fact that a state aid policy - and the Jonckheer report makes this very clear - must continue to afford each state the freedom to define and organise the tasks of the public sector and ownership structures on an independent basis.	0.8445422615824881
At the same time, it must be made clear that aid can serve a useful purpose, with a view to offsetting the deficiencies of the market and furthering Community objectives.	0.7565514804005603
A word on the White Paper: the revision of Articles 81 and 82 represents a change of direction in monopolies policy.	0.6330717088563872
I am opposed to this, unlike the majority of this House and indeed the majority of my own group, because I believe that, in competition policy terms, the directly applicable exception system is in every sense inferior to a system of prohibition unless certain conditions are met, and I believe there is a threat of renationalisation.	0.9663359661734661
The system currently in force creates transparency, affords enterprises legal certainty and has, without a shadow of a doubt, led to discipline and acted as a deterrent on account of the notification requirement.	0.5934664411740928
The problem of overwork highlighted by the Commission is not a sufficient reason for making radical changes to the legal system.	1.0555140418028808
Indeed, it is debatable whether this could be carried through at all without amending the Treaty.	0.5973804502605793
Mr President, I am very glad that Mrs Randzio-Plath mentioned the very important context of our debate because up until now no other speaker has done so.	0.7608876746538658
The advent of the euro at the beginning of last year unleashed enormous competitive forces within European business which are being met by a merger wave of quite unprecedented proportions.	0.6052093334125261
For example, the figures for last year now show that the total value of mergers in the European area was EUR 1.4 trillion, which is seven times the level of merger activity at the peak of the last European merger boom in 1990.	0.755152891735728
This poses enormous challenges for competition policy, which I hope it will be able to meet because, for certain, many of those mergers are going to be designed to protect profit margins of the businesses from competition rather than merely to enhance productivity and make those businesses able to operate on a bigger scale.	0.7203477970771663
Commissioner Monti and his colleagues have a tremendous challenge ahead of them and our worries in the ELDR Group are that there should be no weakening in the thrust of competition policy either in the examination of mergers or the monitoring of restrictive practices.	0.6079378464101047
Delegation to national authorities is all very well but we would emphasise what Mr von Wogau said in his report on the need for regular monitoring of national authorities to ensure that there is no slippage in the European element, and, particularly would ask the Commissioner to reassure us that there would be random checks on that.	0.9789580390955342
Mr President, in the limited time I have, I would like to express my support for the work carried out by all the rapporteurs and my agreement with many of the things which have been said here, in particular by Mr Jonckheer, who criticised the excessive gathering of information and the lack of transparency and socio-economic balance in the granting of aid.	0.8685102718501992
I also agree with the criticism that no emphasis has been put on the implementation of Article 82, especially when we are witnessing abusive conduct in a context of market concentration.	0.7945572200648128
As a Member for the Basque Country, I would like to express my total support for the implementation measures for fair competition in the market.	0.8768020341266023
I say this in case there is any doubt about the criticisms which we have directed at the Commission in general, and Mr Monti, in particular, for its persecution of the incentives to Basque companies and the fact that it considers them to be state aid.	1.0571031444628172
Our discrepancy stems from the fact that the Commission continues to misunderstand the character of the general system and the co-responsibility of our arrangement which gives our Basque fiscal rules the same nature, foundation and aim as the rules of the Member States of the Union, and that they are applied in a general way to all tax-payers who, by virtue of points which fall under an external system of law, are subject to those rules.	0.7629853254777733
Mr President, Commissioner, competition is exactly what we need.	0.8534444259131017
We need competition if there is the least unemployment, for a smooth-running healthcare system, for social justice, for high social standards, and, of course, we also need - these are competition criteria to do with the economy - business management competition so as to achieve highest-quality products, equal market access conditions for all enterprises, and environmentally-friendly products.	0.9404021159665994
In other words, we must succeed in linking the competition criteria that are necessary to the economy with those relating to managerial economics.	0.7340632542901488
I often have the impression, unlike the country I come from - former East Germany - where economic competitiveness is prized above all else and competitiveness relating to managerial economics is disregarded, that very often the reverse is the case; society thinks almost exclusively in terms of managerial economics.	0.672007756339252
I say that as an entrepreneur who has a vested interest in this.	0.6792601328729083
But a system cannot function in this way: it will only work if the two aspects go hand in hand.	0.8214657472968936
I will give you an example: the European Union was right to support the Grönitz steelworks in Brandenburg, although out of 5 000 jobs only 700 remained.	0.8138780810453314
But these are competitive jobs, for this steelworks is now the number two tool steel manufacturer in the Federal Republic of Germany.	0.6935607773003791
Anyone who would jeopardise production at this steelworks on principle, by demanding the return of the aid that was granted at the time, would not just place the steelworks itself in jeopardy but also one of the region' s employers that small and medium-sized enterprises are, of course, dependent on too.	0.6512128730212308
It goes without saying that that is not what the European Union' s competition policy is designed to achieve.	0.8455180584184403
If we want there to be competition then we must establish this link between the requirements of the national economy and the pre-requisites of managerial economics.	0.8347641533948288
Indeed that is the only way to build up regional economic circulation in the under-developed regions that will protect people' s social welfare and boost purchasing power.	0.7295818031680803
To that end, we must also make it our business to take more account of demand-orientated economic policy as opposed to one focusing heavily on supply.	0.7232832880655722
Mr President, ever since I was elected to this Parliament in 1994 I have never witnessed a report which had such anti-Irish sentiments and overtones as the Jonckheer report which we are debating today.	0.7083675357971924
I would like to quote verbatim from the report: "State aid per capita is highest in Italy, Germany and Ireland. Ireland clearly is in the lead when national and Community regional and social funds are put together."	0.690255438954048
I believe that the rapporteur is simply playing with figures.	0.8511090828922431
I find it difficult to understand how he can index regional and social funds into this mathematical equation.	0.6482388521890928
I should like to remind the Member that the European Union has agreed to the new regional aid guidelines for the period 2000 plus. This was merely an extension of the policy objectives to complete the internal market within Europe.	1.0517993662922334
Regional disparities must be overcome if the internal market is to succeed and prosper.	0.5532932582878415
I welcome the fact that grant aid of 40% and a top-up of 15% for SMEs for fixed investment will be permitted for companies setting up in Objective 1 regions in Europe post-2000.	0.6866667628501324
I remind Mr Jonckheer that Irish companies or foreign companies in Ireland still have to cross two sea masses to reach the mainland European marketplace.	0.4286677082068891
No other Member State is at such a disadvantage.	0.7315586556604929
Mr President, the monopolies' ban is the key element of functioning competition order in Europe.	0.6465864674393987
The Commission deemed the practical administration relating to the monitoring of the monopolies' ban to be unsatisfactory, something I would wholeheartedly agree with.	0.6174817770257505
But opinion differs as to the solution.	0.5426228179136804
The Commission' s proposal does not formally deviate from the monopolies ban but the upshot of this proposal is a transition from a ban with permit reservation to a permit with ban reservation.	0.6193258297677421
In other words, we are making the transition from the principle of banning to that of misuse.	0.8660729201096153
Both I and other MEPs utterly reject such a drastic change of system.	0.4264054697777007
I do not accept that a practical transposition problem should give rise to changing the law.	0.6433043784120097
We would be changing the law to make it executable again, which is something I consider to be unacceptable.	0.9898385001444894
The Commission is giving up its monopoly on exemptions.	0.7691001044132417
Competition restrictions are to be automatically exempted against the background of this planned system of legal exemption, insofar as the provisions of Article 81(3) of the Treaty on European Union allow.	0.6588944722930146
The requirement to lodge applications in Brussels will be dropped; in other words, the Commission will be completely in the dark in future.	0.7511128821279032
This is unacceptable to my mind.	0.7563767353350332
The Commission' s programme is to be supplemented by enhanced follow-up supervision of the national authorities and Member States' courts.	0.9031012483885094
But if this takes place in the course of renationalisation then what we will have here is a patchwork quilt of competition policy.	0.7780144472928493
This is unacceptable in my view.	0.7757358652743687
It would weaken a key element of European policy.	0.4851135324510378
The change of system in European monopolies law that the European Commission is contemplating is high risk as far as competition policy is concerned.	0.9169485865897397
There are enough other options in the present system to safeguard open markets and free competition.	0.6138321158645066
In any case, the Commission' s proposal refers back to old proposals that were put forward as long ago as the fifties and sixties.	0.6356796659284818
There was no majority for this at the time.	0.7093802439458721
Since France laid a huge amount of emphasis on legal exemption at the time, it was damaged by concessions in agricultural policy.	0.6108000607911962
Forty years on, this proposal has again been placed on the table and I am certain that it will create room for manoeuvre for the monopolies, to the detriment of Europe' s consumers.	0.9413068694828732
I consider this to be unacceptable.	0.4666098126637713
Mr President, in this important debate on competition, I am speaking this morning with particular reference to Mr Langen' s document on the Steel Aid Code.	0.981538988563035
As the Court of Justice recognised in 1996, the steel industry is particularly sensitive to competition-related disturbances.	0.6593679421749421
Indeed, several years ago, this was the conclusion of a report that I compiled on the strengths and weaknesses of the European steel sector.	1.0182270322821958
This is why it was justifiable to set up a system of aid to this sector with the aim of ensuring the survival of successful businesses, even if this was in contradiction of Article 4 of the ECSC Treaty.	0.8552033270376403
This indeed, is the aim of the sixth Steel Aid Code, but at the same time it is important to avoid any infringement of the conditions of competition and any serious disturbance of the markets, hence the importance of regulating such aid.	0.8765003108574666
It is therefore necessary to continue to limit state aid for research, development, environmental protection and cases of company closure.	0.8117466638417998
In the same category of ideas, it is essential that Member States fulfil their obligation to be accountable to the Commission for the aid granted to their steel companies.	0.8813091977332845
The Commission suggests shorter deadlines.	0.3634942982040175
I agree with this request.	0.6603059498357342
Like the rapporteur, while I am pleased with the Commission report, nonetheless I deplore the fact that it does not cover all aspects of the aid.	0.9823917449504029
Although the Steel Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way, the Commission has authorised granting steel companies aid which is not covered by the categories stipulated by the Code.	0.7799895472463907
In the interests of equality, either the Code must be applied or it must be modified.	0.7387102781364174
Finally, and in conclusion, Mr President, with the expiry of the ECSC Treaty, the regulations will have to be reviewed since I think that the aid system will have to continue beyond 2002, and in that case I am in favour of a Council regulation which will ensure security in this area.	1.050140347598662
We therefore await, and I await, the European Commission' s proposals on this matter.	1.0379685350879861
Mr President, I am also going to refer to the report by Mr Langen, which concerns aid to the steel industry.	1.0908308321747198
I agree with the rapporteur on two issues.	0.8828342415452393
Firstly, I agree on the need to guarantee equal conditions for aid to all Member States and, secondly, on the need for transparency with regard to this aid.	0.9844636975481744
We agree with the rapporteur regarding his criticism of the fact that, despite the rules laid down in the sixth Steel Aid Code, the Commission has frequently authorised aid to companies which do not correspond to the categories in that Code.	0.768348774699745
However, the thing that worries us most, Mr President, is the decrease in prices, by 30%, owing to imports.	0.8671263584344142
The reason for this decrease is unfair competition from South Korea and Taiwan, in the case of steel, as a result of their different working conditions and conditions governing aid.	0.7066496615836934
Orders in the steel industry and the ship-building industry - we also spoke about this a while ago - have decreased drastically, resulting in a loss of jobs.	0.7964854954624496
I live in a region where the ship-building industry now has very serious problems: Asturias.	0.6166881888500698
With global markets, we need global employment laws and global subsidies.	0.7558462236749077
I know this is difficult to achieve now, but if we do not achieve fair employment laws for all workers, here and elsewhere, and we do not secure equitable subsidies for all countries, here and elsewhere, it will be difficult to preserve jobs in Europe and outside it.	0.8874169540197432
Mr President, Commissioner, Director-General, I would particularly like to emphasise the following in relation to the von Wogau report: I welcome the Commission' s open-minded endeavours to initiate debate on the hitherto strict procedural rules, and to propose practical reform measures.	0.7573955739336334
I congratulate the rapporteur Karl von Wogau, who takes up the theme but also makes quite plain his demand for clarification, indicates the accompanying measures that need to be taken, and pulls no punches when it comes to the problems currently under discussion.	0.7086847101754742
The White Paper and the report are contributions made at the beginning of a necessary process of reflection, discussion, and reform which has yet to be concluded because there are still a few questions posed by ourselves, the judiciary, the Member States, and above all the SMEs concerned, that need to be clarified.	0.969247969120004
Competition policy must continue to be accorded central importance and will not be renationalised because this would jeopardise the internal market and Europe as a business location in a global economy.	0.7486873379225667
However, it must be "europeanised" taking into account the principle of subsidiarity.	0.7970729558671311
I also welcome, therefore, the fact that responsibility is to fall to the individual, without the Commission giving up any of its responsibility.	0.8247596408258087
In practice, only 9 cases were rejected, 94% of the cases that the Commission had to process were not dealt with formally but by means of unpublished, non-legally binding administrative communications or on account of the expiry of deadlines, which clearly shows that the work of the Commission is subject to time-related, staffing and financial limitations in this age of globalisation and EU enlargement	0.7890183469680176
To conclude, I would like to tell you what I am expecting from this reform: fair competition and equal competition conditions, legal certainty for all enterprises, consistent application of competition policy, procedural simplification according to the principle of the one-stop-shop, coordination of the national - and to me, independent - competition authorities, close cooperation between the national authorities and courts and the Commission, along with a clear distribution of competences between national authorities and courts in the application of European competition and monopolies law, and I expect the Commission to concentrate on what is most crucial in the fulfilment of its tasks as the supreme guardian of the European competition policies.	0.9066558129516693
I am in suspense as to how the discussions, which were broadly based, will be incorporated in the first legislative proposal.	1.0654089481185258
The Commission report confirms that, with the exception of Germany, state aid to businesses is increasing.	0.8373025454684869
The Commission finds this worrying only from the point of view of the conditions of competition.	0.5959725184171869
As far as we are concerned, we look at things from the point of view of the interests of the working classes.	0.947346783104109
Society gains nothing from these massive transfers of public funds to private business.	0.46483120078046686
Take, for example, the car manufacturing sector, where subsidies and state aid of various sorts have increased by 24% during the reference period.	0.7317811918750037
With what aim?	0.1664222490612832
Not to save jobs.	0.26062717371240185
All these firms have gone ahead with job cuts and even redundancies.	0.3344280978969279
Not to improve working conditions, for in increasing production with fewer workers, working conditions are made worse.	0.7002416259585972
Did these firms need state aid to survive?	0.46943553174647157
No, car manufacturers have been making colossal profits for years.	0.550659342688776
State aid is not only counterproductive because, as the Jonckheer report acknowledges, it gives rise to subsidy hunting with firms relocating from one country to another, but it is unacceptable because it allocates public monies to the enrichment of a handful of private shareholders.	0.8637571057196648
It is because the richest people are being favoured everywhere with state money that throughout Europe social protection is being reduced, public services are being abandoned, hospitals are being closed.	0.6732640858538166
In voting against the Jonckheer report, I wish to assert the need for another policy, to wit, ceasing all aid to private firms and utilising the money thereby saved to develop public services and recruit staff.	0.6821409214482861
Mr President, today' s debate is extremely important because the principle of competition has probably been the cornerstone of the internal market.	0.8021704041824699
In accordance with the principle of competition, the legislation has implemented Articles 85 to 94, competition policy in the strict sense, and the revision of all state aid and tax provisions which may affect competition.	0.7896201216477824
Firstly, fiscal provisions of an indirect nature and recently, thanks to Commissioner Monti, there have been direct provisions, the code of good conduct in particular.	0.7289074036749916
This has worked fairly well, but, as in the famous film Casablanca 'time goes by' and we must adapt the legislation we have been applying until now to the new circumstances.	0.8892559615464138
In this respect I have observed a significant consensus in all the interventions.	0.8152603962674058
Firstly, it is necessary, in drawing up the legislation, to produce clear and complete rules.	1.0542584091776157
It is probably horrendous, especially in this particular raft of legislation, that there are confused rules, regulatory vacuums and rules that only lay down undefined legal concepts.	0.7443736148997493
This is all the worse - as is the case with the second part of this reform - when responsibility for implementing the legislation lies with national authorities.	0.9792401105210484
Thirdly, it seems to me important that the Commission should play a role in resisting the temptation to create independent agencies which would distort the very essence of the Commission, in order to guarantee uniform application by international bodies.	0.8085080387452287
Fourthly, and lastly - and this has already been mentioned - the international legal order has changed.	1.1068860623682257
We have seen this in the aborted Seattle Conference and we are now seeing it in the bilateral conferences with different regions or countries of the world.	0.9420257694211467
The principle of competition must now be universal in its application.	0.6222922920536191
We must monitor compliance with environmental standards, employment standards, in order to prevent dumping in this area, and we must ensure scrupulous respect for property rights and the revision of state aid, which in many industries - as has already been said - distorts competition and destroys jobs within our own territory. To sum up, we should apply similar conditions that will prevent aid, internal distortions by other countries, from being transferred to the international arena, in other words, through trickery.	0.9221369409577297
Mr President, Commissioner Monti, there is much that is good in Mr Jonckheer' s report on state aid for manufacturing industry and certain other sectors.	0.8159322135251408
First of all the report reveals Parliament' s single-minded determination to reduce state aid to ensure that the internal market functions flawlessly.	0.7689287283908042
Many of the report' s conclusions, however, are cause for concern, at least for our group.	0.9657616209840526
For example, the fact that the amount and level of state aid calculated on a per capita basis vary considerably from Member State to Member State reveals the need for surveys such as this.	0.6622772979070328
Aid that is based on the self-seeking ambitions of a nation gives companies unfair advantages, thus distorting competition and leading to an ineffective, uneconomic division of Europe' s meagre resources.	0.5220515221756149
The form the aid takes is important.	0.3152385915642722
Forms of state aid that require an effort from the beneficiary are to be supported.	0.6715651273892793
For example, state guarantees, on which the Commission has just publicised its position, must naturally be considered state aid, but they are, in my opinion, a better option than granting aid directly to companies.	0.9530193317048766
The report on competition policy further stresses the Commission' s confidence in hard and fast rules instead of putting the emphasis on economic arguments regarding efficiency, which affects competitiveness.	0.6876344440286848
The European economy will never achieve the level of competitiveness desired if we do not show we trust in the markets.	0.5768175342560233
If competition policy is to be made subordinate to the aims of social and environmental policy, real efficiency and economic growth will remain just a dream.	0.9283168632611677
Competition policy has to be seen as part of the whole of the economy and it must be assessed with reference to trade policy and non-material rights: we should not just be emphasising its social dimension.	1.010274952932995
The aims of social policy can be best realised through stronger economic growth, not by making compromises with regard to decisions on competition policy.	0.7664555334207025
Mr Rapkay' s report also emphasises the importance of the international dimension with regard to competition law.	0.7649416651846932
In my opinion, it would be good if we could achieve consensus at the international level regarding certain basic principles of competition law.	0.6324701398445087
Aiming instead at harmonised minimum standards will easily lead to a situation where we leap over the lowest hurdle and end up with the lowest common denominator, which will water down all the aims of competition policy.	0.7337999732806469
Mr President, Mr Monti, the reform of competition rules calls for a commitment by the European Union, not only in the light and as a consequence of changes which have taken place through the years, but also with a forward-looking view to the Union' s enlargement.	1.063065045271964
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr von Wogau, for his commitment and I welcome his thoughts.	0.9238804106133659
Moreover, I would like to say that I appreciate the remarks and observations that Professor Tesauro, Chairman of the Italian Competition Authority, sent me, and which I am sure Mr Monti will take into due account with a strong sense of collaboration.	0.8609866805140832
Our real concern is undoubtedly to initiate further liberalisation of the market, and, above all, to achieve consistency between the different national markets. As things stand, there are considerable differences between them which come to the fore if we compare the English, Italian and French markets.	0.8046981044332281
There is a large degree of state protectionism in the French market which is not found in the English market and is only present to an extremely limited extent in Italy.	0.7738064335605219
Another issue concerns the economies of countries involved in enlargement, which may run the risk of remaining assisted economies for ever more if provision is not made for gradual adjustment.	0.6396942582675724
In my opinion, we should also create a threshold below which two significant components which characterise our economic structure should be placed: small and medium-sized businesses, which bind the European economy together, and social protection, which Europe has always guaranteed to the weakest parts of the economy.	0.8942217355909968
Safeguarding the social function of the market is what makes the difference between free trade, pure and simple, and a system for improving people' s quality of life.	0.8776567554007466
A point to consider regarding the new rules concerns the economy of the outermost regions and islands, all of which must be protected.	0.7960013826772738
We ought therefore to consider creating two focal points of an external market by instigating profitable relations with Russia and the Mediterranean countries, precisely so that their economies become less peripheral.	0.5333021276436631
I hope - and I thank Mr Monti for this - that the new rules will reflect as many aspects of economic policy as possible and that their social function will be guaranteed.	0.9814750699795115
Mr President, competition is at the heart of the European internal market policy and is also its driving force.	0.8395788151946898
A free and open market can only exist by the grace of competition, marked by clear, uniform rules.	0.44115901378403266
In his report, Karl von Wogau manages to capture this very well.	0.42785658588750075
But Europe is changing.	0.2400919694633313
The economies are growing, we are enlarging to 25-30 Member States.	0.590305220612351
The European Commission will become overburdened if it pursues its current policy.	0.6367473309548328
It is therefore necessary to modernise competition policy.	0.6376778293794798
This is not in question.	1.0436816630453918
Having said this, I still have concerns about the proposed decentralisation.	0.7040859245836165
How will the Commission, as keeper of the Treaties, guarantee that decisions are taken uniformly in matters of competition in London, Palermo, Helsinki and, soon, Budapest and Ankara?	0.7241758489458044
This is necessary if legal inequality is to be prevented, and issues of competition will gravitate towards the court where the most lenient judgements are given.	0.6475262448849683
It is not enough to say that, in the Member States, there is already 40 years' worth of experience.	0.9786467903453361
In the Netherlands, the competition authority is still in its infancy.	0.8217228656780436
This country has a very small market which, unfortunately, is often at the same time defined as the relevant market. This in contrast to Germany, where a very experienced Kartellamt is exercising its powers within a gigantic market.	0.8266336551307651
The European Commission' s belief that, in all quarters of the Union, legislation will, almost as a matter of course, be interpreted in the same way, is what, within catholic circles, we term "foolhardy," and this is not allowed.	1.0679256201499268
Uniformity needs to be worked on.	0.3481031900170555
Think of specialist, national courts with the option of direct appeal to a special competition court at the European Court.	0.6967056462892178
This special court in Luxembourg is necessary in order to build up broad expertise.	0.5357527380185289
Moreover, due to the immense economic and social interests involved, we cannot afford to wait for a judgement to be pronounced two years after the event, as is now quite normal.	0.9468432603143012
What is the Commissioner' s opinion of this?	0.8011166472508565
I would like to finish off by making an important point for small and medium-sized businesses.	0.6025583234536184
In order to grant small and medium-sized companies greater security, the European Commission itself needs to draw up an exemption regulation for small and medium-sized businesses so that, alongside vertical exemptions, horizontal exemptions will also be possible.	0.7873091422312801
Through cooperation, small, independent firms must be able to stand up to the large chains.	0.6986858065252449
It cannot be the aim of European competition policy to make life impossible for small businesses.	0.8000942112319342
Moreover, regarding these small businesses, we will have to consider whether it would not be better to apply a system with a prior warning built in, the yellow card, instead of an immediate red card, which will be a large fine and will threaten the company' s very existence.	0.9431016279357709
Mr President, being the last to speak gives me the privilege, Commissioner, of telling you that the majority of this House supports your initiative and has expressed a total, and, I believe, justified, confidence in you at the helm of this boat. But we all want to be oarsmen on it.	0.8676558778781311
We all belong on the same boat and want to row with you.	0.43968337754881576
I therefore believe it to be absolutely necessary to establish an interinstitutional dialogue so that we might reach a good conclusion and put all the finishing touches to this essential reform.	0.8148462386885695
The many ideas which have been expressed here could be put into three broad categories.	0.6682017364681219
Firstly, there is the concern that some have expressed, in particular Mrs Randzio-Plath, President of the Committee on Economic Affairs, of whether this new system of legal exception is absolutely compatible with the Treaty.	1.0366226210360463
I share that concern and I believe that this issue should be addressed.	0.770091748578398
Secondly, we have the issue of companies' legal certainty.	1.0359097095240855
It is true, Commissioner, that the Commission is not a machine for manufacturing legal certainty.	0.9430668662754649
We all agree on this.	0.5539844982150174
But it is nonetheless true - and this has been repeated from all sections of this House - that the European industrial fabric is composed of small and medium-sized businesses, and that the Commission often plays the role of auctoritas, of legitimising the nature of the internal market.	0.9974079167950529
On this point I will give my opinion on something which Mr Karas said.	0.7674047592724577
There have only been nine rejections.	0.27967169423229915
But here I would like to call on my experience as a lawyer.	0.6332604227438396
How often has a lawyer with two companies and one project, in the face of a Commission guideline given ex ante, changed that project in order for it to comply with the competition rules!	0.7073426585835297
This is therefore an aspect to be considered.	0.6844721062172306
Thirdly, we have the problem of the uniform application of Community law.	1.004317900842357
In this respect, the excellent speech by Mrs Thyssen cannot be improved upon.	0.745493761773675
I believe that biodiversity is good, as is cultural diversity, but not diversity in the application of the law with regard to the essential core of the internal market, that is to say, competition law.	0.9398047278422902
Here improvements should be made.	0.49808262231769646
Only in certain countries, Germany for example, is there specialised jurisdiction.	0.6867266002113457
Perhaps this is a promising avenue to explore, but we must also explore others.	0.8831029749342613
What we cannot do, Commissioner - and I would like to end on this note - is to give way, and give ammunition, to those who regard the European institutions as the property of the great and the good, of the rich, and not of the citizen, or the small and medium business, which, in the worst case scenario - which will never become reality because the requisite measures will be applied to prevent it - will result in courts which make disparate judgements, very late, with no real possibility of control apart from what the French call "le parcours du combatant", that is to say, after Lord knows how many years, when the Court in Luxembourg passes judgement, a Court which we know to be inundated at the moment.	1.016674827755419
Commissioner, it is impossible to overstate the importance of this reform.	0.7860289292880169
It transcends competition, it transcends the cohesion of the internal market. I believe that it profoundly affects the meaning of European integration, the meaning of the legitimacy of European integration.	0.9860448019335921
Therefore, Commissioner, we are relying on this interinstitutional dialogue to put the finishing touches to a reform which we are all hoping for and which we believe will lead us to a successful conclusion under your direction and with our cooperation.	0.8391715759817405
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I heartily congratulate the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the entire European Parliament for the great deal of interest shown in competition-related subjects.	0.7593438839520532
In my opinion, Mr President, this joint debate fully bears this out.	0.7073960480002781
We have heard some very thorough observations which both concern the philosophy of economic policy and are important for the institutional order.	0.7703716301138889
Our common aim is to reform and strengthen competition policy, a pillar of the social market economy and of European construction.	0.7777582749731503
The guiding thread running through all the aspects of the reform of competition policy, which we shall have the opportunity to address together, aims to ensure more effective protection of competition, reduce the bureaucratic burden weighing down businesses and take decision-making processes closer to the European people.	0.9205897508341686
I, personally, would sincerely like to thank Mr von Wogau for his commitment in examining the dossier on the White Paper and for the quality of his report.	0.8382177851151671
I would like to divide the considerations raised during this debate on the von Wogau report into four groups. I do not consider these considerations to be criticisms of the Commission, but, on the contrary, fundamental contributions, since justified concerns have been expressed that we both want to overcome.	0.759078716373196
The groups are: the efficiency of the rules, the risk of renationalisation, consistent application of the rules and legal certainty. I will take these very quickly one at a time.	1.0943804006960751
Efficiency: I am convinced that this reform will strengthen the protection of competition within the single market rather than weaken it.	0.816838498526538
The current notification instrument, ladies and gentlemen, no longer allows us to reach this objective because it does not guarantee that the Commission is properly informed about the most serious restrictions - I would remind you that, in 35 years, there have only been nine cases in which the Commission has decided on prohibition following notification in the absence of a complaint - nor does it guarantee transparency or provide real legal certainty for businesses which, in the majority of cases, receive a simple comfort letter.	0.8803971624381965
The proposed system will improve the protection of competition, primarily because it will allow the Commission to concentrate its action on the most serious restrictions, also because it will involve national and competition authorities to a greater degree in stamping out infringements, and lastly in that it will allow victims of infringements to have direct recourse to national judges, whose mission is to protect the rights of individuals.	0.9323010264033779
The question of renationalisation: first of all, although it is not really necessary, I would like to point out and stress, several times if I may, that the White Paper does not affect mergers or State aid in the slightest - we are not looking for devolution in these areas - but that, as far as Regulation 17 is concerned, there is a risk of renationalisation.	0.9851101163786757
Of course we have pondered this issue, and we are still studying it extremely carefully, and this is also thanks to the concerns you have voiced.	1.0294986971882822
At the end of the day, I honestly do not believe that this fear is justified.	0.8258975676498986
The Commission proposal accords the Commission a central role in establishing guidelines on competition policy.	0.7773338104478067
The reform does not entail any reduction in the Commission' s activities, but requires them to focus on the most important dossiers.	0.870214048343141
The reform will lead to a gradual development - I stress this because I was particularly taken with this term, used by Mrs Randzio-Plath, and, moreover, I fully agree with it - of European competition culture.	0.9098456963030913
So, the reform will lead to the various national competition cultures being transplanted and taking root in the European competition culture - where today various small plants thrive, and they are certainly not all the same.	1.0421871041289277
The fifteen sets of national provisions will gradually be abandoned, permitting greater use of Community law, which a higher number of protagonists will be able to apply.	0.5988985562055256
Allow me to emphasise that this is communitisation, not renationalisation, of competition law.	1.0677861875281216
The question of consistent application: the risk of inconsistent application of competition rules must be borne in mind, but I do not believe that it should be exaggerated.	0.9213260303247972
As with many other provisions of the Treaty, Articles 81(1) and 82 have, after all, been applied for decades by national authorities and judges, and I do not feel that this has created serious problems.	0.860306205445894
In a directly applicable exception system, consistency will depend firstly on the degree of clarity of the material rules.	0.5735560102438362
The Commission will make every effort to define the legislative framework, both through general provisions and through its decision-making practice.	0.8368636197582469
Secondly, we will need to set efficient mechanisms in place to prevent disputes, and the White Paper sets out mechanisms for information and consultation.	1.009443972125945
In this respect, I would like to say something about the excellent idea put forward by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen and Mr Huhne of monitoring implementation.	0.7318998369631409
This then is the idea of monitoring implementation.	0.5364976418761223
I must say that I find this a very good idea that we will probably take up.	0.9319885020114054
Though we have a high respect for the work of national competition authorities and so on, it is evident that we will watch very carefully how EC law is applied by national authorities and courts.	0.9193888962318578
That is why the Commission wants to keep the right to withdraw a case from a national competition authority in the event of incorrect application.	0.829593145407014
This goes at least some way towards alleviating your concerns, Mrs Peijs.	0.696703136038938
Concerning Mr Evans' point regarding the implications for businesses, it is important that the cost-benefit analysis should be seriously conducted.	0.8072661160362729
The purpose of publishing the White Paper is, after all, to collect comments from businesses as well as from other sources.	0.7313116171186738
We have received many excellent observations and contributions which give us the material to make a cost-benefit assessment for business.	0.6670363647914559
We will examine all that material carefully before making a legislative proposal for a new regulation.	0.7542520863574841
There is one point about the impact for firms which is of great importance. This was raised by Mrs Thyssen, Mrs Peijs and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi: the issue of SMEs.	0.9866587432545991
Many speakers have underlined this.	0.3440720284381127
The Commission is paying particular attention to legal certainty for SMEs.	0.773965765332838
We are proposing a system which considerably improves legal certainty for SMEs.	0.7224996182296987
Why?	-0.0
Is this simply a political gesture?	0.36678170154810275
No.	-0.0
In the system we propose reforming our substantive rules in such a way that most SMEs will be covered by block exemption regulations, as in the field of vertical restraints.	0.7272569426638202
Most SMEs have in fact less than 30% of the market share.	0.8270130632888775
We have a de minimis notice which contains a declaration that since SMEs are not involved in market dominance they are not normally subject to the strict prohibition under Article 81(1).	0.5788845360902773
We are working on further block exemptions and guidelines which will all take into account the particular situation of SMEs, and our White Paper on modernisation will also improve the situation of SMEs, first by eliminating the bureaucracy resulting from the present notification system, and secondly, by making Article 81(3) directly applicable, which will benefit SMEs in particular.	0.8960128184586963
The fourth group is legal certainty.	0.292044886366763
Mr Evans, legal certainty is, of course - and I am the first to acknowledge this - important for businesses, not just for the legal professions, although the latter do play an extremely important role in the construction of Europe.	0.9853502308426856
Legal certainty is important for businesses: this is a subject, the importance of which the Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, emphasised in her last intervention - and I am very grateful to her for the way she always takes the widest interest in subjects regarding the single market, including, in this case, competition.	0.896231517521866
I am convinced that this proposal will increase legal certainty for businesses for three reasons: by virtue of the direct effect of Article 81(3), it will permit authorisation, without a prior decision, of all restrictive competition agreements which meet the exemption conditions; it will create the opportunity to help businesses in the event of doubts over interpretation through the publication of reasoned opinions; it will be accompanied by exemption regulations and guidelines which will clarify the rules and ensure certainty.	0.7965953385147261
(FR) Mrs Thyssen also referred to the matter of legal privilege for company lawyers.	0.7620102975074601
Let me simply remind you that the Court of Justice pronounced a ruling on this in 1982, as you know better than I. This ruling remains valid and there is nothing to justify any reconsideration thereof.	0.8329844934500423
The White Paper requires only a single aspect of the issue to be re-examined: the exchange of confidential information.	0.6870357061153213
The guarantees which companies must be given are currently under discussion.	0.5368201302903708
(IT) I shall now quickly turn, Mr President, to Mr Rapkay' s report, and I would like to thank him sincerely for the quality of his work and for the broad endorsement given to the Commission' s XXVIIIth Annual Report on Competition Policy.	1.002443285599348
We share the same basic views but the Rapkay report lays emphasis on several points that we shall need to consider very carefully.	0.6744446470624471
I will mention only two, in order to be brief.	0.7922126968701089
The first is greater transparency.	0.7611966478617312
Parliament knows how important we all consider the question of transparency in competition policy, as I did right from the moment I had my hearing, on 1 September, in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.	0.9350181354261364
As regards the international aspect of competition policy, I can confirm, Mr Rapkay, that the Commission is willing to provide Parliament with a report on this subject, to which Mrs Randzio-Plath has also drawn our attention. We have very satisfactory bilateral relations with the relevant American, Canadian and Japanese authorities as regards competition policy, and we are working to ensure that competition is treated as a separate topic within the World Trade Organisation.	0.9835196820731245
Mr Jonckheer, I would like to thank you just as warmly for your report on the seventh survey on State aid in the European Union.	0.7274671622671115
I will not talk about codecision here, but this certainly does not mean I do not consider it important.	1.0188656600448778
It has major institutional implications which obviously go beyond the specific area of competition; I am therefore not qualified to give an opinion, and this is obviously a matter for the broader context of the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.840472947787414
With regard to your suggestions, Mr Jonckheer, you already know that my staff, who, although short-handed as usual, are fortunately highly qualified, are working hard to produce the register of State aids and the State aids 'scoreboard' .	0.9073079868552384
I am awaiting with great interest the results of the eighth survey, which, according to the scheduled timeframe, should be being drawn up by the staff now, in January, and for adoption by the Commission in March 2000, to see whether the latest trends are confirmed.	0.9604129153574787
Mr Jonckheer, Mrs Thyssen and Mr Gemelli raised the issue of the state of preparation of the candidate countries in terms of competition in general and of State aid.	0.9724832224464534
I can only say very briefly, that we are actively working with them on a practical level: they are making preparations, they now all have competition laws and are setting up the relevant authorities.	0.9071369737349437
I can also say, in respect of your concerns on energy and especially on the environment - which, as you know, I share - that we are concluding the review of the organisation of environmental State aid.	1.0952874470382514
In connection with the issue of State aid, I would also like to take up one of the points raised by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, among others regarding repayment of illegal aid.	0.8229973857251739
In April 1999, the Commission adopted new Rules of Procedure which introduced specific rules on repayment.	0.7759389554090395
In the near future - and I can assure you of this - you will see just how seriously we mean to take these rules.	0.8832244267835266
Finally, Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Langen warmly for his report, which, although geared more towards a specific sector, is a valuable contribution.	1.0265326691565306
I would like to say that, as we know, the Commission report on State aid to the steel industry does not include individual decisions made under the exception procedure, pursuant to Article 95 of the ECSC Treaty, but addresses decisions which are not covered by the code on aid for the steel sector.	0.8992159098276689
In respect of future provisions on aid for the steel sector, which will come into force in July 2002, we will ensure that strict discipline continues to be applied, and the industry itself now agrees on the need for this.	1.0286342523345129
When we have finalised our proposal on the new rules and decided on the most suitable legal form, I will be happy to present our viewpoint to you.	0.9398199836120668
So, Mr President, I will walk away from this debate, for which I am very grateful to Parliament, in the knowledge that we have the European Parliament' s intellectual and political support, which appears to come from all sides of the House, for competition policy, its basic appreciation for the work the Commission is carrying out and its confidence in our ability to continue to deliver in the future.	1.0471198062820992
I am especially grateful for all of this.	0.6408865465541607
We will continue the interinstitutional dialogue opened with the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, and, at a more general level, with Parliament.	1.0232190555745964
In this regard, I liked your term, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi: we must all pull together, preferably in the same direction.	0.9217598999189957
Competition is not an end in itself, as Mr Rapkay rightly pointed out, but it plays an extremely important role in European integration.	0.979215809618785
As Mr von Wogau said at the start of the debate, at the end of the day competition is not an abstract concept: it is in the public interest and forms the basis of the social market economy.	0.952576864643041
I would also like to say that competition policy will play a valuable social, as well as economic, role in the European integration process, as it has done in the past.	1.0922752064676409
Thank you, Commissioner Monti.	0.9460979213609754
The joint debate is closed.	0.35336613335004935
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	0.15701726649154044
Protection under criminal law of the Union's financial interests	0.6505022236243906
The next item is the report (A5-0002/2000) by Mrs Theato, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, containing Parliament' s recommendations to the Commission on introducing protection under criminal law of the Union' s financial interests.	0.6792167280243758
Mr President, year after year we learn, mainly from the European Court of Auditors' test reports, that money is lost to the budget of the European Union on account of misdemeanours ranging from wastage, mismanagement, and irregularities to suspected blatant fraud.	0.854290382769696
For some time now, these abuses have meant that Parliament has been called upon to initiate measures that should serve to protect the European taxpayer' s money, which, when all is said and done, is what sustains the Union' s budget.	0.8790408244956759
Particular attention in this respect should be given to combating fraud, to detecting it, punishing those guilty of it and preventing it from happening.	0.7892268940434678
Creating UCLAF by means of the Task Force and setting up the anti-fraud office OLAF were important steps, as was the regulation on protecting the financial interests of the Community and on local monitoring.	0.8695797314296962
The Union can only impose sanctions in the field pertaining to administrative law when cases are exposed.	0.6660326081580633
So far, efforts on the part of the Commission to ask for improperly obtained money to be returned only had limited success.	0.7362999258720929
It is for the Member States to undertake criminal measures.	0.845334766537274
Since there is often overlap between the two legal angles and cross-border violations against the Union budget are on the increase - they are also committed by those involved in organised crime - it is unclear as to where the responsibility lies amongst the Member States.	0.758295468398519
Then there are differences between the national legal requirements of the individual Member States, together with protracted or even unfulfilled requests for mutual assistance in law enforcement.	0.7297195552456486
What is more, the agreement on the protection of financial interests and the two subsequent protocols signed by the European Council in 1995 did nothing to change this.	0.9518719873639628
For it to enter into force, it must be ratified by all 15 Member States.	0.7820647204066379
After five years only four have done so.	0.33113200366604967
This state of deadlock, which threatens to undermine the credibility of the Union, has inspired Parliament to initiate the setting-up of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office.	0.8353386900004884
There is no intention whatsoever to create a transnational criminal law and judicial authority, rather the aim is to equip the Union with specific instruments for the protection of its financial interests, that is whilst upholding the principle of subsidiarity.	0.8307614555997332
We are giving new life to this idea with this report and call upon the Commission to present legislative proposals that will enable this goal to be realised.	0.8651051810808854
The concerns of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, as articulated in its position, together with those of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, will also be taken full account of in this process.	0.7106445874131311
We would like to make two recommendations arising from the establishment of OLAF and which should safeguard its operational and legal efficiency, transparency, and the protection of the rights of individuals.	0.8884658237882215
In addition, we need - and this is my first recommendation - a legislative act that includes those offences which are to the detriment of the Union' s financial interests, and in which main principles are firmly established.	1.0001520634336611
I support the proposed deadline for the Commission being 30 September in a proposed amendment.	0.7209914590733155
The second recommendation relates to criminal proceedings.	0.382548910692584
The Commission ought - and I have also amended this deadline to 31 May 2000 - to propose a legislative act on the establishment of an independent body which has institutional links with the Commission, for coordinating and supervising the legal investigative body OLAF.	0.9349557467330835
The existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the Director of the agency.	0.4442725960914473
The proposal for a legislative act of this kind should contain an independent statute for this body and define its tasks, which are confined to inquiries and criminal prosecution undertaken by OLAF into activities which are to the detriment of the Union' s financial interests, and to OLAF' s relationship with the national authorities.	0.8309958225723579
There is no question of this influencing the administration of justice in the Member States.	0.7288925140064226
The Court of Justice is to monitor the legality of the legislative acts.	0.7268844855483668
In addition, we call upon the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to take up debate on the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office for the protection of the financial interests of the Union, where possible on the basis of the now widely recognised study compiled by well-known experts, the so-called corpus juris, and of the feasibility studies that have subsequently appeared.	0.9066929187808633
Further support for this proposal is also to be found in the second report of the so-called Five Wise Men.	0.7386981605430362
The Commission, Mr Barnier, Mr Vitorino and several Member States are equally receptive to the idea.	0.9450752071635604
I call upon you, ladies and gentlemen, to vote in favour of this report, which the Committee on Budgetary Control adopted with a large majority.	0.8181056231606608
We can set another example here, to the effect that Parliament is taking action to prevent mismanagement and in particular, fraud, and to mete out punishment where necessary.	0.8966652965090672
Mr President, I am happy to take the floor in the debate on this report and I congratulate Mrs Theato.	1.3252434322852156
I believe that this is a report for which cooperation between committees has worked very well, and the result, which we have received today, is moderate and thoughtful in a very delicate area.	1.0941455702257357
This moderation and thoughtfulness is particularly necessary in the implementation of Article 280(4).	0.5012067194278989
If we had to give a prize for the article which was most difficult to understand, least clear and most confused - however you like to put it - the competition would be very hard fought. The Treaty is a collection of complex articles.	0.8984600252544969
However, this one would undoubtedly be one of the firm favourites to win such a prize.	0.6926999124459845
At the same time, it is an especially delicate issue because it deals with the protection of the Community' s financial interests, as Mrs Theato has explained very well.	0.8403408854728637
We are all aware - and this Parliament has been the steadfast champion in this respect - of the need to protect the financial interests of the Community. But be careful.	1.2729429718102885
As the French say, "ne jettons pas le bébé avec l'eau du bain" [let us not throw the baby out with the bath water], that is to say, in the protection of the Community' s financial interests, we must respect, on the one hand - as Mrs Theato has said - the competences of the Member States, but also other matters which affect the citizens, which affect the essential guarantees.	0.930143572549385
The conclusions of the Theato report safeguard them perfectly.	0.369134883202389
Therefore, in my capacity as president of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and, of course, as an MEP, I hope that a large majority of this House will support this report and that it will be well implemented by the Commission.	1.1224982764660572
Mr President, this, as Mrs Theato said, is a critical report.	1.2421390265015821
It is a report that has been proposed by the Committee on Budgetary Control and it is an own-initiative report.	1.0447251550443055
One of the reasons why we were very keen to bring this forward was because, whether we like it or not, the European Union has a reputation for fraud and mismanagement. It is sometimes exaggerated but there it is.	0.8680222924269655
We need to do something about it.	0.9125437135045594
Some of the measures we have put in place in the past have not been honoured by some of the Member States - and let us not forget that the Member States are responsible for implementing about 80% of the EU budget.	1.1001499063988043
A lot of them have not signed up to or not ratified the Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests, and therefore it was clear that something more radical needed to be done.	0.9166631899835439
We need to take this responsibility seriously.	0.9978557747145156
We need to be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the European Union.	0.624719144917473
The question is: who prosecutes?	0.7529265919046139
That is where we really get into difficulty.	0.5808555223313596
Whose responsibility is it when you are dealing with a body that crosses so many frontiers?	0.49835158825566367
We need also to be sensitive to the concerns of Member States.	0.8023667399729705
The proposal to set up a European public prosecutor service is a very sensitive one.	0.9535606913904953
We are all aware that an all-out federal approach and a situation where a European judicial authority takes precedence over the national judicial authorities is a step too far for some people.	0.6910255371571706
But the discussion needs to begin and we are therefore calling on the IGC to start discussions.	0.8749144595816745
Of most importance to Parliament, as the guardian of the budget of the European Union, is how to deal with people who work within the European Union institutions.	0.967440195384308
At a time when we are looking at the whole reform process it is critical that we send the right signal.	0.7861931166365183
People need to understand that if they commit fraud they will be prosecuted, and that is not the case at the moment.	1.0114579057143485
The whole question as to whether we have the legal authority to do this has been outlined by Mrs Palacio.	0.9544755084383004
I should like to make clear that my group is going to propose an amendment deleting the detail of how the Commission should tackle this question.	0.9603435754836384
We are aware that it is a delicate debate.	0.9056501730938914
We know that the Commission may perhaps need the scope to negotiate a situation which would be acceptable to all parties.	0.8845805972207098
Can I just make it clear that we have no commitment to a corpus juris here, no commitment to a federal European public prosecutor.	0.9002488548901176
But there is a definite commitment to change the status quo which is totally unacceptable.	0.7400723105732555
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Theato on her report.	0.6712455120431462
I think it is a first-class report which will, for the most part, be supported by my group.	1.0278497699518996
I just have the distinct feeling that she would have preferred to take it a little further at this stage.	0.6108159866966034
Judging from the discussions held over the past five or six months, this could well be the case.	0.8325614392634021
We all know that, in 1995, it was agreed that the Union' s financial interests should be given better protection under criminal law.	0.9965371738752469
But the Member States failed to cooperate.	0.4781584196950475
This is just a political fact about which little can be done at present, I think.	0.9281229078150632
It is now possible, on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty, that the Commission will take new initiatives, and I would like to suggest to the Commission that it do this at the earliest opportunity.	1.0083511147985607
Unlike the previous speaker, who has now disappeared, my group is strongly in favour of a European Public Prosecutor.	0.9461838216689032
My colleague Jan-Kees Wiebenga, will undoubtedly take this point further because he has already published a report on the same subject matter.	0.6841194565244645
I think what we need is, at European level, to come up with exact definitions of fraud and irregularity as quickly as possible.	0.8740359914970793
I myself have been involved in the committee of inquiry on transit traffic.	0.9047096555217404
One of the major problems in this area was that if you do something wrong, especially when it comes to revenue of the European Union, then this will be termed an irregularity in one country and a crime in another.	0.9625657798512038
This, I thought, is no longer permissible, certainly not at the moment.	1.1870234587258388
I would like to make one general point on politics. Whatever we may say about the European elections, the low turnout is a fact.	0.9031556768584932
We can improve on this by punishing crime in Europe quickly, and this must be done at European level.	0.9662945708772217
Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur.	0.8843792267636074
Mrs Theato' s report may help to restore confidence in European institutions.	0.6311202552911215
I believe that is something we are all desperately in need of, bearing in mind the results of the last European elections and of the level of turnout.	0.9847913900204557
Yet, every year we have the same problem.	1.0305953648930284
The Court of Auditors publishes its report, which criticises the Member States on account of various incidences of fraud.	0.7843578914524414
So far, however, the European institutions have not had sufficient means at their disposal to take vigorous action here, to ensure that implementation actually takes place and that matters are remedied.	0.8573221607284189
It is precisely this process that undermines confidence every year.	0.5910925343307715
I believe that Mrs Theato' s report and her proposal can help to reverse this very process and to make clear that the European institutions take steps to ensure that European money is employed in a targeted manner and that no fraud is perpetrated here.	0.8416186684714554
It is important that after the first step, which has already been taken, i.e. forming OLAF from UCLAF - an independent institution - we now take the second step and create a legal framework for OLAF, in order that OLAF too might operate within a secure legal framework.	0.959269102581183
We will need the European Public Prosecutor' s Office for this, which will see to it that there are clear legal guarantees, also for suspects.	1.0040794002355569
Having said all that, I must say that unfortunately, my group will not be voting for your report as a united front.	0.9936476662469479
I hope that the debate will convince a few more people.	0.7357864312274196
Unfortunately, however, people still have too many misgivings to the effect that this will be the kind of European institution that undermines subsidiarity.	0.7343663671060044
But I will do what I can to see that Mrs Theato' s report receives more support.	0.9131192260966691
Mr President, we are basically in favour of the resolution that has been tabled, even if we think that this can only be interpreted as an invitation by Parliament to the Council to amend the Treaties, so that effective protection under criminal law of the Union' s financial interests can be guaranteed.	1.072540241139309
The establishment of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office and the definition of offences common to all countries of the Union is doubtless a good idea, but it is impossible to consider putting this into practice without having first introduced a European legal system.	0.7994344724571086
Indeed, we are talking about criminal law, the area where resistance that national States put up to communitisation is, and will be, fierce.	0.9347240132870035
Indeed, it is unthinkable that we could put in place substantial and procedural legal regulations solely for one sector - that of the protection of financial interests - without first having created a European legal system.	0.7569072125167569
Reading the precise and comprehensive explanations in the Theato report makes you realise just how many problems still need to be resolved and what these problems are.	0.6480973172232964
In any case, this idea must be encouraged, and it will doubtless be during this attempt to protect financial interests that we realise that we need to include a Community corpus iuris in the Treaties.	0.8464674677312051
On behalf of my group, but also personally, I hope that the vital financial spirit of the Union will pave the way for the creation of a European legal system which respects citizens' rights and guarantees, which is to say a legal system that will raise guarantees to the acceptable levels hitherto unseen in many States.	1.0452785430895866
Therefore, on behalf of my group, I would like to say that we support the Theato report; I nevertheless think that this is essentially a subject that should be included on the IGC agenda.	0.9752742546472097
Mr President, Mrs Theato' s report on the protection of the European Union' s financial interests proposes centralising criminal proceedings by initially creating a European Public Prosecutor.	0.8031537507284202
This proposal is radically opposed to the spirit of the current system in which the criminal law and criminal proceedings that lie at the heart of the national legal systems must come under the sovereignty of each nation and lie within the exclusive competence of each state.	0.8338561185694314
But the idea of a European Public Prosecutor, on the other hand, aims in the long term to confine the national states to a subordinate role in these matters.	0.6792870434885259
Moreover, this proposal is liable to set off a chain reaction of totally unforeseen reforms.	0.751583575309145
According to the Theato report, the European Public Prosecutor is needed, in particular, in order to better support the inquiries of the anti-fraud office, OLAF.	0.8884432693273148
At the same time, however, we see from the van Hulten report under discussion today that the European Public Prosecutor should in turn be supervised by a European Union court.	0.8825864637944653
In this way, a small European reform may hide a medium-sized one, and a medium-sized one may hide a large one.	0.9051565476767879
Not to mention that the large one may hide a gigantic one, as the very next thing we will see is a proposal for a European criminal law and then, why not a European Minister of Justice, supervised by an extension of the powers of the European Parliament?	0.9145650254454162
I therefore feel we must carefully consider the balance of power that we are in danger of upsetting if we put forward this type of reform, which appears to be quite specific.	0.7987947955280286
In the final analysis, we feel that proposals such as the proposal for a European Public Prosecutor demonstrate an inability to conceive of a Europe in anything other than a centralised and hierarchical form, organised around a superstate.	0.6896794874912034
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group, on the other hand, wishes to see a polycentric Europe with nations linked in a network.	0.5560224248098138
And such a network could take the form of improved coordination between national public prosecution authorities, for example, and the creation, if necessary, of national teams specialising in offences involving Community finances.	0.7714722710183276
So the legal framework, Mr President, is already in place.	0.974006310034308
It is fine, in principle.	0.898299685263314
It need only be fine-tuned.	0.28843190034877053
Mr President, Mrs Theato is proposing institutional revolution for a twofold reason.	0.6828438534066392
Public opinion, although indifferent to 20 million unemployed and thousands of mad cows, is now supposed to be worried about the fraud endangering financial interests and these two reasons are supposed to justify a twofold solution: a European criminal code with crimes against the Community and a European Prosecutor-General.	0.7428862104783068
Mrs Theato probably forgot to include a European prison now that we have the FBI, the European police, in the form of OLAF.	0.9952612655806241
All this would be established by two regulations, one for the Public Prosecutor and another for the criminal code. The regulations would be adopted pursuant to Article 280 of the Treaty, i.e. based on secondary law, whose characteristic feature is that it makes any sort of secondary shift of emphasis possible.	0.7871287319813263
And indeed there is a twofold shift.	0.5681052020504792
Firstly, the classic Eurofederalist ideological shift, a single market, a single VAT, a single diplomatic service, a single army and now a single criminal code and a single public prosecutor.	0.9723158178548862
All this to combat fraud worth less than EUR 1 billion, while disregarding the tens of billions of euros lost due to the Generalised System of Preferences, free trade areas, customs presents to Chiquita and the billions lost to the fourth resource, GDP, as a result of the budgetary rationing pact.	0.643664893839014
Next we have the Puritan shift: the Teutonic Europe of the North, the Europe of the Lutherans, Calvinists and Quakers, wishes to inflict its moral order on us.	0.7066094432565468
Basically, the more we lose our grip on morals, the more we tighten our grip on our wallet.	0.9138888078405664
Mr President, it is essential for there to be effective protection under criminal law of the financial interests of the European Union, more so these days than there used to be.	0.8753936527065423
The fraud and corruption scandals of the past have had a profoundly damaging effect on the confidence of Europe' s citizens.	0.7678140875656936
The credibility of the efforts we make here in Parliament to employ our finances properly stands and falls with the efforts we make to deal with such scandals and prevent them from arising in the future.	0.596523496157299
This does not just mean administrative changes but also structural changes; in other words we must create instruments which are actually capable of affording protection under criminal law.	0.6283948753721973
The Intergovernmental Conference 2000 will provide the appropriate forum for discussing this.	0.5081264422209665
Now it is, of course, possible to take the view that criminal law and criminal proceedings law are intrinsically matters pertaining to the law of the Member States and it is quite unthinkable that they should be governed by the principle of subsidiarity.	0.7743880577089168
There is no doubt that I myself am one of the advocates of this principle and one of those who oppose any further extension of competences at European level.	0.8467944137940823
When it comes to the demands made on the Intergovernmental Conference agenda, it is the call for there to be clear delimitation of competences that should take centre stage.	0.753900631425781
Now that is not a contradiction, since the demand for an instrument of criminal law and criminal proceedings law, as detailed in Recommendations I and II of the report, is actually about taking action in the EU' s own interests, which, as far as that goes, does not damage the legal interests of the Member States; on the contrary, it protects them, at least indirectly.	1.0479677908073488
The compatibility with the various national systems of law, as confirmed by experts, shows that criminal law is another area where Europe has a great deal in common, for example where the significance of the offences we have been discussing here is concerned.	0.9170266683412862
Taking these aspects into account, I consider it appropriate that we create a framework of this kind, as proposed, and I also consider it necessary to the further development of OLAF.	1.0547990889054504
Mr President, will a European Public Prosecutor be able to abolish football fraud involving EU funds?	0.6602553036157485
I do not believe so.	0.7981798431352511
On the other hand, we can go a long way using the existing tools.	0.8919269399585058
An alternative to the European Public Prosecutor could be Eurojust, as proposed at the last Summit.	1.0285828167065236
In the way it is structured, Eurojust should correspond to Europol and support investigations into crimes.	0.6490292004046894
It is just such practical cooperation there is a need for.	0.6729108470712272
OLAF, Europol and the Treaty on Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters should be used fully and, when the Fraud Convention from 1995 is at long last ratified in the Member States, we can also achieve a lot with this.	0.863478014156946
I nonetheless agree with the rapporteur that it is quite unacceptable that most Member States should still not have ratified this Agreement.	0.8347927374290502
It is simply too bad, and I can well understand why people are becoming impatient and demanding that we have a common European Public Prosecutor' s Office instead.	0.9595288422926646
However, it would be quite a mammoth task to establish such an Office.	0.6979026286490426
It is, after all, only the most serious crimes which would have consequences under criminal law. Ninety per cent of cases would be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or incompetence.	0.7355440608976512
Instead, there is a need for proper internal control and the ability to sack people more easily.	0.6445417439996779
We should alter the staff regulations and disciplinary procedures and, especially, change our practice.	0.7222755286707967
At the moment, Article 52 of the staff regulations concerning dismissal on the grounds of gross negligence is never used.	0.5569014785021676
Should we not make a point of cleaning up our own act and putting our own house in order before we plunge into constructing grand new institutions!	0.5172501171476351
Mr President, we all want to do something about combating European fraud.	1.0497088670321248
But the question is now: is the European Union doing anything about it as well?	0.9587418952457545
The answer to this is that we know very little about this.	0.9716436075639925
The Tampere Summit was about combating crime.	0.39298465739707866
Everyone was supposedly pleased about it but, in reality, we have made little progress.	0.9476251079439498
There is no European anti-fraud legislation in force because the Member States, as was stated before, have not ratified the treaty texts submitted.	0.947743578826179
So a great deal has to be done in this area.	1.0582229352451746
And what exactly should be done?	0.49496242245170785
Two things, and Mrs Theato' s report clearly spells these out.	0.7782893276760786
Firstly, the same penalty clauses regarding European fraud must apply in all Member States of the European Union.	0.6834056746692907
So, unification in this small area.	0.37197778898439426
Secondly, we should indeed set up a European Public Prosecutor' s Office with two tasks, firstly to assist the national public prosecutors, helping bring criminal proceedings in European fraud cases and, secondly, to supervise Europol and OLAF in a judicial sense because these are two criminal investigation services which can operate at the moment without any judicial supervision.	0.7659763858915247
The European Public Prosecutor' s Office is nothing to be afraid of.	0.6888787889722331
I feel there is a lot of scaremongering going on.	0.5393954475411195
It is, in fact, something very positive.	0.7769226920475379
Just like Europol. Europol, involving police cooperation, does not rank above the national police forces, but is there for the purpose of exchanging information between police forces.	0.7203908027823679
This is exactly the task which a small, limited, European Public Prosecutor' s Office should carry out, not just at the criminal investigation stage, but also at the prosecution stage.	0.8380644712730312
Parliament supports this.	0.19936993564434852
The Committee of Wise Men supports this.	0.4748179363779681
I urge the Council of Ministers and the European Commission to do the same.	1.2041680169568703
Mr President, I want to concentrate on the issue of corpus juris.	0.7203018657197723
I would very much like to support what Mrs Morgan said on this issue.	0.5954054490179517
Corpus juris is something that was set up without any kind of public debate or public participation.	0.6037048980511529
The idea of a European Public Prosecutor on the continental inquisitorial model with overriding jurisdiction throughout EU territories would have a major impact on the traditional systems both in Ireland and the UK.	0.6444519599870796
The idea of a single criminal code and the European Public Prosecutor is something which Member States have a right to be informed about.	1.0812592507485832
Indeed when the plan was initially drawn up they said it would be restricted to cases of fraud against the EU budget.	0.5856532285493817
But when corpus juris was actually launched in 1977 in San Sebastian - to a very select audience of 140 jurists, with no media invited - the President of the European Parliament at the time, Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, said that he considered it embryonic and that the intention was to extend EU competence in criminal matters to all areas of criminal activity.	0.8652175066729715
We need a public debate on this.	0.8951868368610671
We need the Member States and the citizens in the Member States to be properly informed.	1.1606299017922264
The issue of the threat to the traditional legal system in Ireland and the UK needs to be addressed.	0.7546506945161886
There needs to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there has been to date.	0.7522111993513088
It is unacceptable that something like this has been foisted on the Member States of the EU without any proper public debate.	0.8242051354229949
Mr President, on behalf of the Italian Radical Members, I abstained on this text in the Committee on Budgetary Control, because I share the concerns that have been voiced, in such an authoritative way, by the representative of another legal culture which is certainly important: common law.	0.996729761459662
With this text we are undoubtedly forcing the issue, since we believe that there are points that must be resolved and it is important for Community fraud to be curbed, to be crushed.	1.0013974723815304
Nevertheless, the way in which our committee intends to see this text through, with the drive and stubborn desire of its Chair, Mrs Theato, will not be without its critics.	0.9737786790735452
Another major criticism of the text concerns secondary law.	0.5113008003311361
Article 280 of the Treaty allows the Council to pinpoint the appropriate instruments to curb fraud.	0.7156125308727188
Nevertheless, we are left feeling slightly perplexed that they envisage an institution which will mean higher quality, without immediately planning how to deal with the repercussions of this. That is to say, they are neglecting the area of defence and therefore the possibility for the prosecution and the defence to work together effectively within such an important legal system.	0.8011453569251641
We wanted to express our perplexity as regards these points by abstaining in committee.	0.5278076199564358
Mr President, we need to speak our minds on this subject in the European Parliament, during the plenary sittings and in the committees, even if it is obvious that the debate must take into account the world of the culture, the legal culture and the places where institutional issues are addressed.	0.9795532044371172
We find ourselves dealing with some very serious events, which in the past seemed to be the norm.	1.0297761416754847
Today, something has changed, at least in terms of mechanisms, and especially as regards monitoring, but we are still not satisfied, particularly if debates are held in competent fora that go as far as to discuss a European Public Prosecutor, crimes, fraud, the misappropriation of funds and the disclosure of confidential information pertaining to one' s office at European level.	0.9215924406596898
I feel that we must clearly safeguard the Community' s interests, its image and its relationship with taxpayers, who are an indispensable and essential part of Community life.	0.8589098417251099
For this reason, it is right to look at the issue of safeguarding common interests, and to establish better links with legal systems within the individual States.	0.9458234228811222
In this respect, we are faced with the most sensitive issue: what role would a European Public Prosecutor play in relations with the individual national communities and their domestic legal systems?	0.7920463306870987
This issue needs to be explored further in both cultural and practical terms.	0.4344307087961926
Today, we run the risk of adding a new institution to the already numerous and varied institutions which exist within each country.	0.6079230978866338
Mr President, I would very much just like to add to two particular points.	0.9288090484910614
Firstly, I would not wish to take up the philosophical issues of subsidiarity and the sovereignty of Member States, although I am very much in favour of having such a debate, for my regular viewing of British television programmes has shown me what the national politicians are conjuring up there in the way of threats posed by the continent to the home-grown legal system.	0.8068326123923719
Sometimes it is worthy of satire and merits discussion, but I digress.	0.6817579360821168
The point I want to make relates to Mrs Theato' s report.	0.608044271027719
I believe that as far as the judicial difficulties are concerned that we are facing here - and the European Union evidently has only very limited room for manoeuvre when it comes to making these offences litigable as European criminal offences - we have become embroiled in legalities.	0.8874154575687647
I am referring to Recommendations 1 and 2.	0.5298833829539723
After all, there is no longer mention of a European Public Prosecutor, rather, for legal reasons it has now become an independent, European authority, or "body" to quote Mrs Theato.	0.9073978725506315
We obviously have difficulties there with regard to the legal basis.	0.6327711327901738
We also face difficulties with regard to offences.	0.35636084766873455
Nothing has changed there.	0.2389472354565739
As has always been the case, there are offences that transcend European offences, as it were, or at least there is the potential for them to do so, and these might include money-laundering, receiving stolen goods, and forming a criminal organisation.	0.9111129079952899
As far as that is concerned, I believe there are judicial uncertainties that need to be overcome.	0.9326438253864147
What Parliament needs to do as a matter of urgency though - and this is why we intend to vote for recital 1 without these recommendations - is to send out a clear political signal to the Commission and Council that we want to see a clear legislative act put an end to this disorderly state of affairs.	0.9344856788939605
Mr President, for years, Parliament has called for specific and uniform protection under criminal law of the Union' s financial interests.	0.8114641837285118
Frustration inevitably sets in when we see the weakness of the Convention (and of the protocols relating to this protection) which, five years after being signed, has still not been ratified and has still not come into force.	0.8043702336289136
On the other hand, more pro-active attempts, such as OLAF, which is currently operating, have not allayed legitimate concerns about the system of guarantees for individual rights.	0.7933871121885339
The proposals in Mrs Theato' s report seek to encourage the Commission to present a substantive legislative measure on the protection, under criminal law, of our financial interests, which would criminalise certain activity, specifically fraud against the Community budget. These proposals represent a serious attempt to establish a new and ever more urgently-needed uniform criminal law for the whole Community.	1.0254603950992653
At the same time they call for the existence of an independent body to coordinate and monitor the thoroughness of investigations by OLAF, without harming the administration of justice by each Member State and under the supervision of the European Court of Justice.	0.8153252566671846
Finally, following on from what was agreed in Tampere, the report restates the need for a European Public Prosecutor. This issue has been brought once again to the fore by Commissioner Vitorino' s timely decision to ask the IGC to include in its agenda the creation of this new role, which everyone considers vital.	1.0919982178815801
We should approve this report because it highlights the need to maintain efficient legal control over our institutions, by protecting the Union' s financial system with a substantive and procedural European law which is capable of maintaining the credibility of the Community' s economic life.	0.6949890932427593
Nevertheless, it raises some very basic questions.	0.7832881806860129
Is there currently a sufficient legal basis for justifying, in legal terms, the creation of a specifically Community-wide criminal law which, although it might be called subsidiary, will always clash with the practice, and in certain areas, with the traditional, separate criminal law of the Member States?	0.9540214370598815
As there are doubts, would it not be more advisable, from a political point of view, to put the reform of the legal system on the IGC agenda, and incorporate these proposals into the more general reform of the Union' s legal system along the lines of what is being requested for the European Public Prosecutor?	1.0740960016363863
Surely these subjects will be of the greatest relevance to a revision of the treaties which will contribute to the stability of the area of freedom, security and justice?	0.7338895074221969
Mr President, the EU is now exposed to tough scrutiny.	0.9894008047601807
Confidence in the European Union has been seriously damaged.	0.9598061027316656
To remedy this, vigorous efforts are required.	0.36843775538806195
We therefore welcome increased resources for OLAF so that we can investigate any suspicions more efficiently.	0.6005515615310159
At the same time, we think it is obvious that those who commit crimes against the EU must be able to be held accountable in an effective way.	0.9184496557780082
It is unfortunate that the convention for protecting the Union' s financial interests has been put into effect in so few Member States.	0.787795588912988
We therefore think it only right that the Commission should have the task of tabling proposals entailing the further development of the already existing legal framework.	0.8047297926717903
On the other hand, I am not convinced that making the process more efficient in this way requires common European legislation or centralisation of the fight against crime.	0.7894734957258736
In the present situation, I am therefore sceptical about the idea of a European prosecutor, which it is scarcely possible to implement within the framework of the present treaty.	1.156771485418349
We have more confidence in Eurojust, where prosecutors from the individual nations cooperate.	0.6085986632242467
The major problem is not that no measures are being taken against crimes committed against the Union but, rather, that these are committed so often and far too seldom discovered.	0.8622364017663053
The challenge for the Commission and for ourselves is, however, to find the right mix.	1.0897570437085622
The mismanagement and examples of fraud which occur ought not to lead to our ending up in an old-fashioned hierarchical bureaucracy which, through an exaggerated supervision of detail, prevents the development of a modern administration.	0.6805314343584834
We therefore welcome the aggressive approach of Mr van Hulten' s report.	0.5907582683040185
The main idea ought to be that each administration takes responsibility for its own supervision.	0.6319723221860567
Our experience of modern administration tells us that openness, decentralisation of responsibility and qualified evaluation are often as effective as detailed bureaucratic supervision.	0.5020031572003103
The major challenge is, therefore, to create a modern and efficient administration without compromising on supervision and the rule of law.	0.681791751171024
This requires staff training, more modern recruitment methods and, above all, openness and public control.	0.5882256701542846
Being able to scrutinise the administration effectively is the best protection against irregularities.	0.5540429592793742
Mr President, rapporteur, restoring the confidence of the citizens in the work of the European institutions and in European politics is one of the most important tasks we have before us.	1.0284199063231187
The Commission has given its commitment to this task and the draft for the overall package of internal reforms documents this.	0.6970797711013256
Parliament is committed to this task, which is something this report bears impressive witness to.	0.7837942071803404
On behalf of the Commission I am able to congratulate the rapporteur on having again addressed the genuinely difficult question as to what we can do, in terms of creating legal bases and effecting institutional change, to step up the fight against fraud perpetrated against the European Union.	0.9135647900435847
On ratifying the Amsterdam Treaty, all Member States stated that they wanted to accord combating fraud against the financial interests of the European Union the same priority as combating fraud to their own detriment.	0.6325479715485921
Yet as things stand, only the first four Member States have ratified the agreement concluded in 1995.	0.6545990879837271
The Commission wholeheartedly agrees with the rapporteur that this is an unacceptable situation	1.0265220254488592
A legislative act, a directive, in which there is a standardised definition for the different types of fraud such as money-laundering or corruptibility, and in which the obligation to launch criminal proceedings is enshrined as a binding objective, may enable us to take a major step forwards, and I will therefore advise the Commission to examine this step with all due haste.	1.021400572966657
OLAF, the European anti-fraud office is one of the most important instruments the Commission has for fulfilling its obligation to combat fraud.	0.9092677024330114
Accordingly, the Commission refused to put up with the fact that both European banks, the ECB and the EIB, contested the right of OLAF to include these two institutions in its investigations, citing their independent status.	0.7718524233949314
This is why the Commission resolved on raising a complaint against these two banks at its last meeting, and I hope that Parliament approves this step.	0.8199104034066983
The second recommendation in this report relates to assessing the legitimacy of the investigative measures undertaken by OLAF in the various European institutions.	0.6921208962357414
It is the task of the monitoring committee for OLAF, which was set up at the same time as OLAF, to safeguard the independence of OLAF, however it cannot undertake the action mentioned in the report of monitoring internal investigative activities conducted by OLAF.	1.0616562081040959
I am fully in agreement with the monitoring committee and the rapporteur on this point.	1.0600238593104747
In other words, there is a loophole here which must be filled and I will examine the solution advocated in the report in the interests of moving things on.	0.7515543492896218
There is one thing I would ask though: I believe we must prevent the debate on extending the legal basis for OLAF from leading to the misconception that OLAF does not now have enough authority.	0.9195219648841336
No, there must be no undermining of OLAF' s authority, and neither do I think this was the rapporteur' s intention.	1.0338287771843935
As such, I would ask you to give OLAF' s work your full support, also in its present form.	0.8530993355435804
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.	0.7451878499652116
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	0.15701726649154044
VOTE	-0.0
(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)	0.6789564982665948
Heaton-Harris (PPE-DE).	0.4285305276985863
Mr President, on a point of order I should like to ask you for clarification of the Rules of Procedure: namely Rules 133(2) and 138(4). These are both about voting.	0.9250029688833702
Is it not the case that on votes other than roll-call votes, the vote should take place initially by show of hands and only then, if there is some doubt, should we utilise the electronic voting system?	0.8643762111131558
That is quite right, Mr Heaton-Harris. I put the matter to a vote by a show of hands because none of the groups had requested voting by roll call.	0.8012223207498645
You know that voting by roll call or electronic checking only takes place if Members of the House request it.	0.573735774313753
In this particular case, I can assure you there was a large majority in favour of the directive which we have just voted on.	1.2834499512331794
Mr President, I was not referring to that particular vote but to votes in general.	0.7728724532949719
It is obvious that some presidents do not look at the hands, so to speak, but go straight to the electronic voting system.	0.703315724812277
I was wondering whether this is the correct procedure.	0.8695386592501926
I know it takes longer, but should we not always have a show of hands first?	0.8752435677934557
Mr President, as far as the second reading is concerned, the Commission can only accept one proposed amendment put forward by Parliament.	1.0729977503146007
The Commission hereby adopts this amendment and accepts it.	0.2631759145047641

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Own resources	0.3566355809233134
. (FR) The European Union is apparently financed through four own resources.	0.7197843816130756
The European budget is effectively sourced from VAT and on the basis of GDP, especially now that the Community preference system has been abandoned and the multiplication of free trade areas has put paid to customs duties and the common agricultural levy, which had already been cut back drastically by the Generalised System of Preferences.	0.7616545783969098
Since then, Community VAT fraud and distortions in the calculation of GDP, the taxable basis for the fourth resource, have had a perceptible effect on the yield and justice of Community resources.	0.7293941505301356
Since then, of course, this Europe with pretensions to federalism is now more than ever financed like the commonplace intergovernmental organisation it actually is, but which it refuses to see itself as.	0.6923922906755839
This can be clearly seen in the regulation before us.	0.6855135997993279
It shows a concern with the accounting involving own resources, the process of making them available or with the monitoring of declared amounts made available to the Commission.	0.733790773470116
Furthermore, the new Advisory Committee that has been created is made up of representatives of the taxpaying Member States.	0.8065648883283253
This is a long way from offshoots such as the "Community criminal code" , the "European Public Prosecutor" or a European police force, with OLAF.	0.9416339505362409
There is as yet no federal European tax.	0.32737460431830673
All the same, a Europe with 25 members will be wanting a European tax on income, if not on profits, or the tax on CO2 to finance the budget for 2025.	0.9649966047849435
Koch Report (A5-0105/1999)	0.1995034323482758
- (FR) It is with great satisfaction that I welcome this report on improved harmonisation in the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods.	0.5661852090166832
In recent years, the transportation of dangerous goods nationally and internationally has increased considerably, increasing the risk of accidents.	0.6707453362417963
Some of these risks were due to an inadequate awareness of the risks inherent in such transportation.	0.6096115438835982
It therefore proved necessary, in the context of establishing the internal market, to adopt some measures intended to ensure better risk prevention.	0.7647455835849387
Directive 96/35/EC was a response to this requirement.	0.49270923365056524
Firms involved in the transport of dangerous goods and in the loading and unloading operations related to such transportation have been obliged, quite rightly, to comply with regulations regarding risk prevention, whether road, rail or inland waterway transport is involved.	0.693503457444678
In order to facilitate achieving this objective, Directive 96/35/EC provided for the appointment of safety advisers for dangerous goods who would have appropriate professional training.	0.5665126140784859
This professional training would be targeted at awareness of the terms of the legislation, regulations and administrative conditions applicable to such transport.	0.524444332131099
While this represented significant progress at the time, the lack of specific terms governing the harmonisation of examination requirements proved to be a problem.	0.6685279784418426
It therefore seemed essential to make good this omission in order to achieve the standardised, high-level training of safety advisers, but also in order to avoid any disparities between the costs of training, with a concomitant effect on competition between the firms of different Member Sates.	0.9189440934897467
The Commission proposal seeks to ensure that the training of safety advisers is standardised.	0.741106499085227
It outlines the minimum content of examinations and defines the role of the authorising body as well as the requirements demanded of the examining bodies.	0.5433486193019357
Parliament voted in favour of this text.	0.509092872134752
It did, however, table a number of amendments, most of which were adopted in the Council' s common position, particularly regarding the need to draw up a questionnaire and statements on the authorisation of some document in the context of the 'specification of the examination arrangements proposed by the examination body' .	0.7731083590734671
In order to be realistic, I further support postponing the date for the application of these conditions until three months after the directive itself comes into force.	0.8072927583395978
I shall conclude by emphasising that harmonising the professional qualifications of advisers will contribute to improving the quality of the service in the interest of users, to minimising the risks of accident likely to cause damage to the environment as well as significant damage liable to be harmful to any person who may come into contact with dangerous goods.	0.6968627992626028
Koch Report (A5-0104/1999)	0.18055552541515743
Last October I expressed my views on the Hatzidakis report on the transport of dangerous goods by rail.	0.5664229954282677
The views I shall express today are not far removed from those I had then.	0.39924838185899014
Essentially, my opinion is as follows: I deplore the fact that, in a field as crucial as the transport of dangerous goods, we keep putting off the adoption of harmonised standards to the detriment of human beings and the environment.	0.8157962599796955
I shall point out that a directive on the approximation of Member State legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by road came into force on 1 January 1997.	0.6588947329717557
This included a number of interim conditions valid until 1 January 1999.	0.3646585857983189
This is the time when we should have expressed our opinion of the Commission proposal to put an end to the derogations.	1.2627925946713403
In line with the usual procedure, it is the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) which puts forward standards in this area, and they are then integrated in to the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road signed in Geneva in 1957 (known generally as ADR), applicable throughout Europe, whose terms and conditions form the basis for the legislation applicable within the EU.	0.7786289835804765
The CEN has been unable to complete its work in the time allotted.	0.7178213601968164
Consequently, the Commission proposal under discussion today is intended to amend the directive in order to provide a short-term solution to these problems, rather than to put an end to the transitional arrangements, as should have been the case!	1.0400125685788033
This is exactly what happened in the case of transport of such goods by rail, except for the fact that a time limit had been decided.	0.7817860461761671
Right now we do not have the slightest idea as to when the CEN will be in a position to put forward practical proposals.	0.7107959375308553
Until then, there is really no point in Member States amending their national regulations.	0.6644254854082634
The report also accepts that some flexibility may be adopted, and grants States the option of adopting or applying alternative standards.	0.6155567911067377
They may, therefore, continue to enforce their own standards regarding certain types of pressure vessel used for transportation, where there are no applicable European standards.	0.6408548984823492
They may also adopt alternative conditions for transportation of a local nature and for ad hoc transportation.	0.4188915714225824
In offering this explanation of my vote, therefore, I wished to express my deep dissatisfaction and my deep concern.	0.6071904090249626
Schroedter Report (A5-0108/1999)	0.19480566060133075
Mr President, I wanted to press home my explanation of vote by this oral explanation following on from the Schroedter report with regard to regional development.	0.6597852151427589
I would urge both the Member States and the Commission to give sufficient consideration to the huge disparities in wealth which continue to exist between the different regions in Europe.	0.9944672605110805
Not only the difference in income per capita but, above all, large disparities in employment continue to give cause for concern.	0.6126194470077322
Despite the fact that the Community, through the structural funds among others, injects considerable sums into combating the disparities between regional development opportunities in Europe, these disparities continue to exist.	0.6816035845129473
I therefore wonder whether the Community should not have a more drastic change of tack and, based on very strict evaluations, change its course and change its objectives in such a way as to make it possible to combat the disparities in wealth and employment more effectively.	0.7229206084596542
Mr President, in relation to the Schroedter report, I am aware, and have had it confirmed to me by Mr Barnier, that the rules on additionality concerning Structural Funds apply only at the level of Member States and do not apply in a transitive and transparent way inside Member States in favour of self-governing regions such as Wales or Scotland.	0.8561680951504731
I regard that as a very unsatisfactory state of affairs.	0.6175488643349296
I hope we can revisit this issue at a later time.	0.8001846241411378
I want it to be clear that though I voted in favour of the report, I have this important reservation.	0.9743966298074457
- The Schroedter report speaks of the need to promote partnerships with regard to the spending of EU Structural Funds in Europe for the period 2000-2006.	0.7604415927363642
I believe that this is particularly important as EU Structural Funds are always spent in a manner which maximises the economic development of different regions when local and regional authorities are involved in the decision-making process for the spending of such funds.	0.7712472137824449
As a Member of the European Parliament for the constituency of Leinster, I have always supported the need for the implementation of bottom-up schemes supported by national EU funds.	0.9035356878685226
I believe that the Irish Government and the European Commission and different EU governments cannot alone decide on specific spending priorities.	0.8697219199797801
I believe that local authorities and groups from the private and voluntary sector should be fully involved in the decision-making process for the spending of European Structural Funds.	0.759854477858117
For example, we have seen the success of the Leader I and Leader II schemes in Ireland in terms of the jobs which have been created through the administration of these programmes in rural parts of Ireland and within Europe.	0.9058584175856749
The Leader III scheme is set to be implemented some time later this year.	0.5697198274791755
The Leader programme at its core affords an opportunity for public, private and voluntary groups to pool their collective talents so as to create long-term and sustainable jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas.	0.6367643627168458
This is a classic example of how the partnership concept operates and such schemes must be supported in its broadest remit.	0.7274791381151225
The European Peace and Reconciliation Fund has also been a success in creating jobs in border counties in Ireland.	0.6338604788974929
Once again, there is active participation from groups from the private, public and voluntary sectors which suggest how best particular funding can be spent so as to help different local job creation projects within this region.	0.5908256956442787
During the next round of EU Structural Funds 2000-2006, other EU initiatives such as "Equal" and "Urban" will be operating.	0.6742718720048393
These initiatives must also involve the participation of local authorities and local communities in an effort to identify where best European Structural Funds should be spent.	0.6215568657147936
The rapporteur refers to the need to implement an integrated approach to new EU Structural Fund plans and programmes.	0.5920489398008848
They must promote a decentralised, efficient and comprehensive partnership based on the skills and commitment of all sectors in regional and local authorities.	0.6813594064486737
This is very sensible because key economic and social difficulties in our country cannot be overcome unless there is key integration between national, European and local funding.	0.684657659932265

(FR) This report takes us back to the question of why we even have a regional policy.	0.7316940882120774
In order to reduce disparities between regions, of course.	0.851431234871983
But more especially because, even though at first sight the European market guarantees us improved functioning of the economy, it may also be a source of inequality.	0.8907524673020386
Jacques Delors was accustomed to saying that the market was short-sighted and hence the political need to reduce disparities.	0.6298628029845208
It is precisely this phenomenon of solidarity which lies behind the European social model, which we are all in favour of, and which gave rise to the idea of economic and social cohesion.	1.094041249772812
This is a real political objective, alongside economic and monetary affairs, drawn up in collaboration with Member States, regions and local communities, with the Commission itself responsible for issuing guidelines in order to show Member States what direction to take in order to achieve the objectives required in the context of programming.	0.8820113342856634
This is why I shall support this report, despite regretting the fact that, for timetabling reasons, the European Parliament was only consulted at a very late date on the guidelines intended to assist Member States, regions and local communities in the programming of Objectives 1, 2 and 3.	0.8915794748560865
Moreover, I would also urge this House to take into consideration the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, adding a whole raft of thoughts on key areas such as combating social exclusion, support for the social economy and the implementation of the employment strategy.	0.8794710119390635
Mrs Schroedter' s report marks a further step towards the transparency and effectiveness of structural aid.	0.6117093469046607
It highlights the increasing vital role of all the parties involved, chiefly those involved at a local level, who are the only ones able to define specific requirements and social problems, hence our determination to ensure that the partnerships to be established are true partnerships, which are decentralised and involve all the agents concerned.	0.8364631949564445
This is the reason for the request which we are putting forward again to establish a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States, which would coordinate the implementation and administration of aid.	0.859737748055912
In order to do so, the monitoring committees must be opened to include Members of the European Parliament, associations and industrialists concerned by the projects and also civil society.	0.7866066199858692
These guidelines represent a step towards the improved effectiveness of Community structural aid.	0.4958661916805975
Amended again as such by the Schroedter report, they are a step in the right direction.	0.60161408771298
They also call for a general debate on the future of the cohesion policy after 2006, but that is another subject.	1.0296586269745807
In the meantime, let us support this first step.	0.6268464759438954
- This report calls for drastic cuts in the level of illegal state aid dished out by some Member States.	0.5803092109355844
Although I wholeheartedly support this aim, I would much rather see such aid eliminated altogether.	0.6870147806680733
In my mind, illegal state aid amounts to little more than state-sponsored social dumping.	0.4207909380997407
We all oppose social dumping when perpetrated by fat cat industry, we must also oppose it when perpetrated by governments.	0.6588323328339515
If we are to have an effective single market that makes European industry globally competitive and generates wealth and employment for all Europeans, then we must have a level playing field.	0.822489091224981
Illegal state aid, by contrast, destroys competitive companies and creates unemployment.	0.5342281383361304
There are, of course, cases when state aid can be necessary and legitimate, for example helping companies restructure.	0.6205184740604096
In all such cases, however, strict criteria must be met and prior approval from the European Commission gained.	0.6807762509178346
Whether we are talking about beef to France or about backhanders to industry, EU Member States must not be allowed to flout the law.	0.6840889534927764
I enthusiastically support the report's proposal to publish a "scoreboard" showing the amount of state aid per Member State.	0.5134756342003083
Countries that claim to be at the heart of Europe but which systematically break its rules should be named and shamed and their hypocrisy revealed.	0.5437827542833579
Member States cannot be allowed to proclaim European solidarity in public while trying to undermine the single market in private.	0.5627949672747524
I take some mild encouragement from the fact that levels of state aid to industry in Europe appear to be falling.	0.6456539353602404
Much remains to be done, however, and I call on the Commission to be far tougher in exposing the subsidy junkies of Europe.	0.8674857683977707
.	-0.0
(PT) The Commission' s main instruments for overcoming regional disparities are the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. It is therefore crucial that the European Parliament drafts its broad indicative guidelines without threatening the principle of subsidiarity, given that establishing the development strategy for each country falls to the respective Member States.	0.8213528400811957
Unfortunately, the European Commission has already moved ahead with its guidelines and Parliament' s position on the programmes for 2000-2006 does not carry much weight.	0.8930968813815603
It is nevertheless important to reiterate the need for the main priority of these funds to be the development of the countries and regions with the greatest problems and of the outermost regions, of which the Portuguese regions of the Azores and Madeira are examples. This must be done with the objective of achieving economic and social cohesion.	1.0958464564179164
The truth is though, that the Commission' s guidelines do not fully meet these objectives.	0.7767791382379359
On the other hand, it is crucial that there are precise indications and sufficient funds in areas such as creating decent jobs - with rights - effectively promoting equality in law and opportunity, and supporting the social economy and solidarity. There must also be support for rural development, for small and medium-sized enterprises, for improving the quality of life of urban populations in deprived areas, specifically in the field of social housing, with a view to achieving sustainable urban development.	0.838314850567181
.	-0.0
(IT) While Article 158 of the EC Treaty aims to promote the harmonious development of all of the Communities, we must say that the goal of eliminating disparities is still a long way from being fulfilled, or rather in some cases, as with Italy' s Objective 1 zones, paradoxically, disparities are being exacerbated, particularly because of the continuing weak approach of the structural apparatus to Community procedures and the persistent muddle of procedures; despite the changes to the rules, the Community structures have not yet been streamlined.	0.9279852572323153
In the first place, if administrative procedures are not simplified, it will be hard to attain Community objectives on reform, with a view to greater efficiency and concentration.	0.8277794980272766
In this respect, the Commission document has shortcomings, as it makes no recommendation to the Member States to simplify procedures and national legislation for the presentation and examination of projects by the national authorities, and for their funding, execution and monitoring.	1.0314676058364025
SMEs, micro-enterprises and craft businesses in particular are still "weak operators" , given that it is precisely for them that the regulatory and administrative constraints imposed by some Member States, including Italy, are major obstacles to accessing Structural Funds.	0.7035218209690753
A considerable stumbling block is the fact that the regions and other operators find it impossible and are incapable of making plans in time.	0.5941721013047878
In view of this, in accordance with the decision on the 97/99 guidelines (Howitts report), the Commission should have consulted Parliament in time. In fact, it found a sort of convenient excuse in the shortening of the programming stage in the Member States, and it published the guidelines back in July 1999, even before the new Parliament had taken up its legislative duties, thereby preventing Parliament itself from having any influence on the current content of the guidelines.	0.8456687937210072
This is why the mid-term review, provided for under Article 42 of Regulation 1260/99, will be of considerable importance.	0.8216031175431103
In general, the current guidelines cannot be considered as clear or transparent.	0.713335972240322
They merely touch on the - nevertheless important - issue of the possibility of assessing the progress made in relation to verifiable objectives which are completely consonant with the strategies followed in Community policies, and they do not pay enough attention to the implications of enlargement, so much so that they do not contain specific provisions or clarifications as regards either regional and national authorities, or candidate countries.	0.7415381779741037
That said, the differing approach adopted in the guidelines, which are not geared to geographical objectives, but rather to policy areas, can be considered as positive.	1.1269651232286997
While in theory this may meet the need for concentration and therefore the efficiency of interventions, we cannot help wondering whether the current situation of the Objective 1 zones allows, in practice, a policy of integrated interventions, for which an operational instrument to coordinate the appropriations is necessary.	0.9641123142010637
We could then, theoretically, also support the Commission' s call for a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States, with the task of coordinating the implementation and administration of structural assistance there,provided that this unit does not become a centralising instrument at supranational level, but guarantees real help for those zones - and I stress this once again - which, owing to a whole string of converging negative factors, have not yet harnessed Structural Funds to sufficient levels, with the result that replacing the geographical objective with policy areas could, in fact, amount to a negative intervention.	0.740142492696442
The guidelines, as adopted by the Commission, are very limited because, instead of meeting the aim of providing guidance, they are providing a shopping list of possible measures, a shopping list which, as it fails to set priorities in ascending order, could even put the Member States on the wrong track by guiding them towards a series of proposals that is at odds with the desired concentration.	0.8781244948601229
We could say that, in this state of affairs, we have once again missed the opportunity to really strengthen sustainable urban development by ring-fencing ever-increasing urbanisation and, hence the destruction of the countryside.	0.7913893349603609
There has been no appropriate assessment of the importance of the global grant instrument, which could prove to be extremely useful in redressing the balance between urban and rural zones and, moreover, would accord proper status to local bodies which, being independent, could bring about the conditions for territorial development more quickly, and make a practical contribution to the efforts to reform the Structural Funds and to achieve the objectives of efficiency, concentration and administrative reform.	0.9542649578182254
Rural areas must truly be seen as a resource which should be increasingly invested in, by encouraging young people to remain in rural areas in order to prevent their economic and social disintegration.	0.9080723884066852
It is now a fact that in order to attain this goal, rural areas need to see the creation of new jobs, which are no longer solely connected with agriculture, in the traditional sense - although this sector is important for the protection of the environment and the preservation of biodiversity - but also, for instance, in rural tourism, sport and cultural activities, environmental projects, SMEs, services, and so on.	1.092494664708988
A genuine flaw in the guidelines are specific guidelines for the orchestration of coordination between the ESF and employment strategy. The fact that this coordination is being put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme period implies that the Member States really do need "guidelines".	0.7727899978406862
I must also stress that once again the Commission is, in fact, skirting the issue of practical action on equal opportunities.	0.8366527332230748
In conclusion, the document is not particularly satisfactory, and in some aspects is disappointing.	1.0109163100530505
Berend Report (A5-0107/1999)	0.22102832422499782
. (PT) We basically agree with the assessment and the thoughts put forward by the rapporteur concerning the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union.	0.7141680286349321
We shall therefore confine ourselves to highlighting a few issues.	0.5209287465649541
Firstly, and as the Commission itself states, it must be understood that the great improvement seen by some of the poorest regions in their per capita GDP between 1991 and 1996 was largely due to the inclusion of the new German Länder in calculating the Community average from 1991 onwards.	0.8872774467857156
This obviously caused a slight reduction in the Union' s per capita GDP level.	0.5500648986770719
We also feel that it is particularly important to state that the recovery seen in some regions - where it did actually take place - was accompanied only to a limited extent by growth in employment. This consequently imposes the need for new development strategies, with a considerably greater level of attention needing to be paid to this area.	0.8545676618991888
This situation shows that it would be a mistake to leave adopting measures for promoting employment to the exclusive internal control of the Member States, which is what the report proposes.	0.8477242868855793
Finally, but no less importantly, I would like to refer to the rapporteur' s proposal that, in future, this type of report should also include, amongst other issues, an analysis of the way cohesion is developing between the regions within each State.	1.011992260519497
The huge variety of situations and the varying development seen from region to region within the same State mean that there is a need for an in-depth assessment of this issue. This kind of assessment would enable us to allow and guarantee corrections to regional (and other) policies with a view also to guaranteeing internal cohesion within each Member State.	0.757305525499168
. (FR) Considering the employment situation in the Community and the European Union' s declared ambition to steadfastly attack unemployment, the analysis of mergers carried out by the Commission should take elements other than competition into consideration.	0.9111025390128019
As an example I would give the restructuring of ABB Alsthom Power. A sizeable delegation of employees of this firm from throughout Europe is visiting Strasbourg today.	0.6301447769457387
The management of ABB Alsthom Power, following a merger carried out in June 1999, announced restructuring where there is already the prospect of layoffs in a number of countries.	0.7317512519772176
This damaging situation for employment raises many questions, particularly regarding the information given to the European Works Council, in existence since 1996.	0.8467657262445835
It suggests that the Community directive on European Works Councils must be updated and strengthened.	0.5113026934061763
It also requires the monitoring of mergers taking employment, the environment and consumers into consideration.	0.7974900443381019
Since the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did not go far enough in this respect, I abstained.	0.7999297445410974
.	-0.0
(PT) By proposing to apply the principle of subsidiarity in Community competition policy, the Commission is devolving to national authorities and courts the responsibility to take decisions and deal with abuses of dominant positions in relation to company agreements which create market distortion. Issues of mergers and state aid however, still remain within the notification system.	0.8378221935671128
The position that has now been adopted aims to create more rapid ways of applying competition policy, moving towards applying Community law in national courts rather than at the European Court of Justice, and even aims at having specialised courts.	0.7544085218451783
This partial renationalisation of competition policy could involve higher costs for Member States.	0.4502979645404309
On the other hand, as the rapporteur points out, in the name of competition policy, public monopolies are often exchanged for private monopolies, with the privatisation of important industries and public companies, as has happened in Portugal, with harmful consequences for the country and its workers.	0.9218505916848214
- (FR) The Commission' s White Paper on the modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty (now 81 and 82) certainly does not propose any "renationalisation" of competition policy, as some Members of the European Parliament fear.	0.7745650966281148
But it does, at least, make it possible to anticipate some rather interesting options for development of the European Union.	0.7386916649542857
In fact, taking note of the congestion of its services due to the prior notification system of state agreements likely to cause distortions in trade, and afraid of seeing the number of notifications increase yet further with the arrival of new Member States, the Commission is proposing to do away with the prior notification system of such agreements, and to apply competition rules at Member State level in a more decentralised fashion.	0.786587926270767
The most remarkable thing, in my view, is the message conveyed by this proposal: that the Commission is anticipating the consequences of enlargement and realising that this necessarily, and virtually automatically, requires reform of the centralised system.	0.8860140323424774
Admittedly, this reform is one of increasing flexibility rather than dismantling.	0.780077765697925
Indeed, the White Paper envisages that the Commission will retain the supervision and central direction of the new system.	0.9308527795882274
Moreover, the von Wogau report, which the European Parliament has just voted on, supports it in so doing.	1.0609118330216503
But at the same time, one can clearly see that the upheaval caused by enlargement may lead to Community competences being limited and subsidiarity being extended.	0.5991061577218123
It is a quite different Europe which is taking shape in the long term.	0.8520382147042755
Is this not, indeed, what is so distressing to some Socialist Members of the European Parliament?	0.8926616423106376
The German Social Democrats voted against the von Wogau report because, in their view, it might break up European policy on competition, which is to say, in plain terms, attacking the standardising superstate.	0.9251007667436919
Curiously, a number of employers agreed with them, preferring the European "one-stop" system, which they consider to be more economical and more stable legally.	0.7399945389585739
Indeed, this is one advantage of the present system.	1.2011172652363484
But, on the other hand, the wider view must also be taken, namely that the initial decentralisation which has been begun today may, in the long term, lead to greater freedom to take the requirements of each country into account, and this will be of benefit to everyone.	0.9587727024130877
Rapkay Report (A5-0078/1999)	0.20953986792415696
The Members of Parliament from the Lutte Ouvrière Party shall not be voting in favour of these reports on European competition policy.	0.6814355844276313
Competition is a war which has major concerns fighting each other, which constantly takes the form of layoffs, factory closures, not to mention extensive waste of production capacity.	0.7239920852083574
We see a further example of this with the planned layoffs in Europe proposed by the corporation ABB Alsthom Power.	0.6224783153078184
Eighteen million unemployed and 50 million poor people within the European Union, despite its being one of the wealthiest regions in the world: these are the results of this competition which the European institutions intend to promote.	0.9311928561533184
The Commission' s declared intention to regulate the conditions of competition on the European market is ridiculous, for the only law which competition respects is the law of the jungle where the most powerful squash or devour the weakest elements.	0.788054363247247
This is repulsive most of all in social terms.	0.5997392461731985
The European Commission' s report is a blunt demonstration of the fact that the Union institutions have no interest in anything except the major capitalist corporations who are engaged in this economic warfare and have no interest in the victims this causes.	0.7475342906109209
There is nothing to prevent the spread of unemployment, nothing to protect employees, nothing to prevent the major concerns driving part of the population into poverty simply to make their shareholders richer still!	0.8843987955361975
We acknowledge that this report does have one good point - it shows that the working class majority in society can expect nothing from the European institutions in terms of safeguarding their living conditions, and still less of improving them.	0.8760665940345367
- (FR) In voting against this report, we are acting as spokespersons for all the men and women who in Seattle and throughout Europe expressed their rejection of a world reduced to strict commercial logic.	0.6835825557525175
We are voting against this report on behalf of the development of public services, in memory of the victims of the Paddington rail disaster, killed not by fate but by an absurd determination to have competition where there should instead be regulations.	0.7910875726129234
This report is essentially a primitive text with no inspiration other than the law of the jungle, for it is not competition that can solve the problems facing humanity at this turn of the century.	0.8045617345024761
Whether it is a matter of the balance of the biosphere, culture or cooperation with the third world, excessive competition is a factor increasing regression and insecurity.	0.9161249501536126
Do you imagine that the 18 million unemployed people in Europe are victims of too reticent an application of this competition policy?	0.6007417499937359
We are convinced that the opposite is true, and we do not think that state aid is by definition excessive.	0.9504183803333582
Excessive in comparison with what iron rule, what criteria of efficiency?	0.619649765293463
Finally, after Seattle, do you really think you can advocate increasing the role of the WTO?	0.8375352106053355
Only the legal advisers to multinationals could demonstrate such stubbornness.	0.2973840319655561
Jonckheer Report (A5-0087/1999)	0.2170542900532894
I am pleased to see the quality of the seventh report on state aid within the EU, and to see that it will henceforth be an annual report, and also that the Directorate-General for Competition will be making information, both general and specific, publicly accessible via its website.	0.9952597382498695
I am happy with the rapporteur' s treatment of state aid and I congratulate him on this.	0.8174763065916121
There is too often a tendency to criticise state aid harshly as a measure causing distortion in competition.	0.46042685020637314
Admittedly, an effective competition policy is a prerequisite for the proper operation of the internal market and of economic and monetary union.	0.9206138495010117
However, as the rapporteur pointed out, such aid is occasionally essential and may, in addition to enabling the survival of a specific firm, make it possible to contribute to sustainable development (Article 6 of the Treaty), services of general economic interest (Article 16) and economic and social cohesion (Article 158).	0.9522475490241114
Clearly though, it must be monitored, a task which falls to the European Commission.	1.0268545463045309
The aid which Union Member States allocate each year to the sectors under consideration reached a total of EUR 95 billion in the period 1995-1997, including 40% allocated to the manufacturing sector.	0.6752369474274854
This aid is considerably less than the previous period, 1993-1995 (a 13% drop in the total amount and a drop from 3.8% to 2.6% in the amount of aid to the manufacturing sector).	0.7026641173304586
This downturn in aid is chiefly due to the reduction in aid granted to the new German Länder.	0.6792535803811146
Like the rapporteur, I deplore the fact that the figures given in the report do not cover all state aid.	0.8239970237284215
The European Commission must make good these omissions as soon as possible.	0.6950581908271639
It must also cooperate with the Member States in order to improve the quality of data in good time, which is to say in time for the ninth report.	1.0023582462578913
I think it would be a good idea if the Commission published a register specifying the amount of state aid per Member State.	0.8075046568635614
I also deplore the fact that the European Parliament has been totally excluded from the Advisory Committee on State Aid.	0.8289869538252423
In order to compensate for this situation, the European Commission should be obliged to make regular reports to us.	0.903840239876737
I shall conclude with one aspect of the use of state aid which I feel is particularly dangerous: the matter of aid resulting in businesses relocating from one Member State to another, with the risk of subsidy hunting which makes no contribution to the shared objectives of the EU.	0.759891688872876
This is why I should like to see the next report on state aid include some assessment of the effect of such aid on employment, industry and craft businesses in the beneficiary countries.	0.7856984643508276
Langen Report (A5-0073/1999)	0.2111947306692457
In the important debate on competition this morning, I expressed my views on Mr Langen' s report on the implementation in 1998 of the sixth Steel Aid Code.	0.7078821965491636
Just as the Court of Justice recognised in its order of 3 May 1996, the iron and steel industry is particularly sensitive to disturbances to its competitive operation.	0.5755131812757452
Establishing a system of aids to this sector intended to ensure the survival of successful firms was therefore justifiable, even though Article 4(c), of the ECSC Treaty prohibited any sort of state aid to the steel industry.	0.7728172651572137
This, indeed, is the purpose of the sixth Steel Aid Code.	0.7492812088466154
At the same time, it is, of course, essential to avoid any disturbance of competition conditions or of the markets, hence the importance of regulating such aid.	0.621729695274625
It is therefore essential to continue to restrict state aid to research and development, environmental protection and aid granted in the event of plant closure.	0.7898398031578294
In the same way, it is vital for Member States to fulfil their obligation to report to the Commission on the aid granted to their steel undertakings, as stipulated under Article 7 of the Steel Aid Code.	0.936776091878922
The Commission suggests that Member States submit their reports within a time limit of two months following the end of each six-month period or, at least, annually, without the need for reminders.	0.7728574081940127
Like the rapporteur, I am pleased with the Commission report, but I did deplore the fact that the report did not cover every aspect of the aid.	1.1114726268517199
Although the Steel Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way, the Commission has, on a number of occasions, authorised aid for the steel industry even though such aid did not fall within the categories set out in the code.	0.8565188705808252
In the interests of equality, there are grounds to either apply the Steel Aid Code strictly or modify the Code if the Commission wishes to authorise types of aid other than those legally acceptable at the moment.	0.5691084858303502
Finally, we have the problem of the consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty.	0.963245495841409
The aid system must effectively be continued beyond 2002.	0.37230403310518945
My feeling in this respect is that only a Council Regulation can provide the necessary legal certainty and ensure an official ban on any aid not covered by the code.	0.7493198014466677
For all these reasons I voted in favour of the Langen report, and I now await the Commission' s response to our requests and demands.	0.7040913558998299
(The sitting was suspended at 1.05 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)	0.3303598828728866
Oil slick off the French coast	0.10488343225651213
The next item is the Commission statement on the oil slick off the French coast.	0.7219259365781988
Mrs de Palacio will open the debate on behalf of the Commission.	0.7349613061583488
Mr President, I shall be speaking on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, but also as an elected representative for Brittany, and I am therefore directly concerned and shocked by these events.	1.017032405637525
Together with Mrs Grossetête and the PPE-DE Group, we tabled a motion for a resolution.	0.6628069254362237
I am pleased to see that we have today arrived at a compromise motion.	0.9837236178775367
The Erika shipwreck is a truly European issue, firstly because it is disfiguring and polluting some of the most beautiful beaches in Europe, with extremely serious consequences for tourism, people who earn their living from the sea and environmentalists, and also because the underlying issue is the regulation and monitoring which ought naturally to be on a European scale.	0.8194616522724504
A disaster of this scale could almost certainly not have occurred along the American coastline, and why?	0.6825674232734121
Because the Americans managed to learn their lesson from the Exxon Valdez disaster and in 1990 to draw up the Oil Pollution Act, which makes the parties concerned aware of their responsibilities, as it makes it possible to hold the charterer liable, and is more restrictive, and, more especially, more carefully monitored thanks to various regulations and, in particular, the existence of the American coastguard.	0.9445877087832634
If, I repeat, we had had regulations of this type, then this disaster would surely not have occurred.	1.0648225998059513
This is why we think that the applicable legislation must be reviewed, particularly the 1992 protocol which has exempted the shipowners, in this case the oil tanker charterer, from any liability.	0.9850827616635389
Well, if the charterer is exonerated, then of course he is less concerned with the inspections which oil companies are responsible for.	0.8323425587881014
The regulations must therefore be reviewed, and I thank you, Commissioner, for highlighting the inadequate features of current European regulations.	0.8514935517440181
Moreover, as you said, monitoring must above all be stepped up: that of the flag state, that of the classification societies.	0.9734951985227407
You told us that RINA was an Italian classification register recognised by the Commission.	0.4724209171793265
What are the conditions for this recognition?	0.6646155562886842
What guarantees are there of its reliability?	0.29641879293739315
You are going to commission a fact-finding mission.	0.3573125579200901
We await the outcome with great interest.	0.4742789443464383
Inspections by the maritime authorities and supervision within European ports must also be tightened up.	0.5259016507020379
There is a Paris Memorandum in existence, let me remind you, which stipulates a minimum for inspection, that is, one in four of the vessels putting into European ports must be inspected by the maritime authorities of the country concerned.	0.8147750374495785
This obligation is not respected either in France or in many other European countries.	0.601341924633432
Why not?	-0.0
What conclusions has the Commission already drawn or what conclusions is it going to draw?	0.4893464123054755
I also think it essential to step up the level of inspection that the charterer is responsible for, in this case, the oil company.	0.9399027143912442
If the charterer' s liability entails a financial commitment, then doubtless the inspection will be enforced to a greater extent.	0.6776353432771458
Finally, we need some coordination of national maritime authorities in order to achieve some sort of European facility comparable to the coastguards who supervise the coasts of the United States.	0.7442034645633862
Firstly, I would like to thank the environment colleagues in my group who approached this particular problem jointly with their transport team.	0.6425492380238577
This disaster is both a transport and environmental one and is not confined to one area.	0.6393343984161631
Here we are here again in this Parliament discussing yet another maritime disaster.	0.7393085008777359
I could reel off the list of disasters that have afflicted this industry in my 10 years in this Parliament but I only have three minutes.	0.653182735170837
Surely it is now about time that not only the Member States but that toothless tiger that is known as the International Maritime Organisation, and last but not least, the oil companies and tanker owners take on their responsibilities by acting to stop these ecological and human tragedies repeating themselves year after year.	0.8016747091130163
How many more Erikas do we have to endure before the powers that be deliver to us a proper port state control that is effective throughout the whole of the European Union, not just certain areas of it?	0.7276147748406433
How much more pollution do we have to endure before the industry delivers us tankers with segregated tanks and double holds?	0.4894567239469101
How many more seabirds are to die before shipping companies end the practice of cleaning their tanks at sea which, as our resolution points out, causes far more pollution than any Erika-type disaster?	0.6035185683969877
While I recognise that some progress has been made in areas like port state control and minimal crewing standards, we are still faced with what our late colleague Ken Stewart used to call 'ships of shame sailing in and out of our European Union waters: rust buckets badly crewed'.	0.6576025607125835
We need the Member States to act quickly and decisively.	0.8506607408782737
We need our governments to put up the financial resources needed to give us effective control and we need them also to stop dragging their feet when it comes to maritime safety.	0.7000123277055678
