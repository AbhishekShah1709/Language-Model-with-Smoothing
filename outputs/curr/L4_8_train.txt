Only few patients with AIS are referred to a hospital within three hours after onset of symptoms, and only 3% of these patients qualify for treatment with rt-PA.	0.8187860852395166
Therefore, only few patients with AIS will potentially benefit from therapy with rt-PA if NINDS criteria are applied.	0.580899827891025
The goal of the Second European-Australasian Acute Stroke Study (ECASS II) was to evaluate safety and efficacy of thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA in AIS for a 6 hour time window.	0.7153472563634011
Objective: To prove the response and side effects of sulphasalazine in early and late onset juvenile pauciarthritis, also the therapeutic effect dependent on the marker HLA B27.	0.7252900140832037
The radiologic imaging methods play an important role in the precise staging as basic requirement for an effective concept of tumor therapy.	0.5075947700355279
The accuracy of ultrasound in the primary staging according to the TNM-classification (UICC) was therefore prospectively investigated in 260 patients with head and neck tumors of the clinical stages T1N0 to T4N3.	0.7510859568107958
The clinically (C1) and sonographically (C2) evaluated pretherapeutic stages were compared to the postoperative histopathologic tumor classifications.	0.5926122084428199
The clinical staging was correct in 75.0 %, high in 7.7 %, low in 17.3 %, the N-stages were correct in 59.2 %, high in 17.7 %, low in 23.1 %.	0.7619944519252622
The sonographic staging was apparently superior with the T-classifications correct in 92.3 %, high in 7.7 %, low 0.0 %.	0.6342284974727493
The N-stages were correct in 89.6 %, high in 9.2 %, low in 1.2 %.	0.7123146749546692
The accuracy of combined TN classification rose from clinical 46.5 % to 84.6 % by sonography.	0.7249489276201717
Accompanying inflammations, foregoing biopsies and tooth extractions were the main reasons for incorrect staging.	0.4034993989320991
Therefore, the thorough sonographic investigation performed after the clinical examination and before invasive procedures, due to little patient discomfort, good availability and high accuracy, is an excellent sectional imaging method for staging, therapy-planning and follow up of tumors of the head and neck especially of the orofacial regions.	0.7295487298324885
Standardized guidelines for exercise training for patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) have not been established.	0.7089405389628661
In the past CHF patients involved in exercise training studies demonstrated a wide range of cardiac and functional impairment, with an ejection fraction between 18 and 35% and a peak VO2 between 12.2 and 25.4 ml/kg/min on average.	0.8122098689013987
For determination of training intensity, a VO2 between 40 and 70% of peak VO2 and/or training heart rate between 60 and 80% of peak heart rate was used.	0.7104283595517767
There was also a wide range for frequency (between 3 and 7 times per week) and duration of training (between 20 and 60 min per session).	0.7540786862445064
For aerobic exercise training only continuous training methods were applied.	0.32361985458086795
We have developed a new interval training method which allows intense exercise stimuli on peripheral muscles with minimal cardiac strain.	0.4006306327674591
After only three weeks of training, the improvement in aerobic capacity was similar to that reported after longer training periods using continuous methods.	0.575876324243314
To determine work rate for work phases of interval training, a special steep ramp test was developed.	0.46096373149934405
By analysis of acute physical responses to this testing procedure and to the interval training, both were proven to be tolerable in CHF patients, even if their ejection fraction is as low as 13%, or peak cardiac index not greater than 1.6 l/m2/min, and peak VO2 less than 8.5 ml/kg/min.	0.761002865992181
Therapeutic choice in laryngeal carcinoma is influenced by the nature of the tumor and a variety of factors involving the patient and physician.	0.7141651285264651
Small (T1) and exophytic (T1, T2) tumors are suitable for radiotherapy.	0.5544971866171158
Limited lesions (T1, T2) can be cured by functional endoscopic resection techniques or external partial laryngectomies.	0.4278848913468054
Extensive tumors (large T2; T3) are treated by total laryngectomy or by primary irradiation, especially in the case of a good response to induction chemotherapy.	0.6954622233981711
When radiation treatment fails, surgery succeeds in more than half of the cases.	0.5288923617770785
Tumors infiltrating or transgressing the laryngeal framework (T4) can only be cured by total laryngectomy followed by radiotherapy.	0.4792577064603973
Subtotal or circular ablation of the adjacent pharynx or esophagectomy needs repair with visceral or myocutaneous grafts.	0.37682781897231354
Lymphatics are preferentially treated with the same modality as used in the primary disease.	0.8051359037669663
Inconspicuous lymphatics should be treated electively in most cases, with the exception of early glottic cancer.	0.6366607499310827
Induced hypotension is defined as a reduction in mean arterial blood pressure to 50-60 mm Hg in normotensive subjects.	0.7395613602677945
The aim of induced hypotension is to decrease intraoperative blood loss, decrease the need for blood transfusions and improve operating conditions.	0.65950150817776
Most studies indicate that induced hypotension can decrease intraoperative blood loss by 50% in many surgical procedures; however, some studies report that blood loss is not significantly reduced.	0.664829842856521
Current methods of induced hypotension are based on the use of rapid and short-acting vasodilators as primary agents (nitroprusside, nitroglycerine, urapidil), supplemented by volatile anesthetics (isoflurane) and/or -blockers (esmolol) to improve effect, reduce dosage and prevent side effects (reflex tachycardia, tachyphylaxis, rebound hypertension).	0.5861319622276449
Proper positioning of the patient and controlled ventilation aid in reducing blood loss.	0.7135404090016416
Major risks of induced hypotension are a reduction in blood flow (i.e.	0.6086041897207453
ischaemia) of vital organs (brain, myocardium) and elevation of intracranial pressure in neurosurgical patients.	0.7564371678710637
Thus, major contraindications of induced hypotension are severe coronary artery disease, hypertension combined with arteriosclerosis of cerebral vessels and increased intracranial pressure in patients with cerebral disease.	0.6460748547982176
Complications are rare in otherwise healthy patients, but may be higher in elderly patients and those with underlying organ dysfunction.	0.8457689856969258
Therefore, careful assessment and selection of patients, together with consideration of the potential complications, appropriate choice of drugs and invasive beatby-beat monitoring, are essential for the safe practice of induced hypotension.	0.6645977359134223
Abstract  Empirical results stemming from infant research have contributed extensively to the understanding of coping with psychosocial stress and vulnerability for psychosomatic symptoms in later life.	0.4091563161734543
The interaction and the emotional exchange between caregiver and child in the first months of life lead to representations of interactions that will be the base for the quality of attachment.	0.5486701444714965
The mutual regulation of the caregiver-infant-pair enables the child to acquire a psychic capacity to regulate physiological requirements.	0.3922912825766356
This selfregulatory function determines the potential of the later adult to react to distress - in a symbolic way using words or more in a somatic way by developing psychosomatic symptoms.	0.6320290387285497
First experiences with the treatment of psychosomatic patients with respect to the new findings about self-regulation are reported.	0.5878586070590239
A 31-year-old pregnant woman had to undergo emergency abdominal surgery due to acute intestinal obstruction.	0.4820542265913774
The patient's preoperative history demonstrated multiple allergies as well as abdominal trauma several years before.	0.5925773334768357
The physical examination - including sonography of the two fetuses - showed no pathological signs.	0.9145974876160455
Anaesthesia was induced intravenously with the operating table tilted to the left side, using routine precautions pre-oxygenation, and rapid sequence intubation, and was maintained unproblematically.	0.8232723232266714
About 20 min after the onset of surgery, hypotension, tachycardia, and a drop in oxygen saturation appeared.	0.7606258068420354
Volume substitution and the application of vasoactive drugs failed to stabilise the haemodynamic situation.	0.3957590102539147
Elevation of the pregnant uterus and increased left tilzing of the operating table did not lead to improvement.	0.48945695194463185
The development of eyelid edema led to the diagnosis of an anaphylactic reaction.	0.593694085462287
The patient was treated successfully with epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids (prednisolone).	0.6732429258895322
The suspicion of latex-related allergy was verified postoperatively by radio-allergen-sorbent test (RAST) and prick and scratch tests.	0.4354393106995743
The mean arterial blood pressure is decreased during the first two trimesters of pregnancy and increases to preconceptional values during the last weeks of gestation.	0.7105305738574127
The heart rate increases during the whole course of pregnancy.	0.4460191356682967
During late gestation fewer patients show an increase in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate in the standing position.	0.44585319492536285
A fall in heart rate was only seen in this period.	0.7300300203953453
A fall in mean arterial blood pressure during standing is not related to the blood pressure in the supine position during the whole course of pregnancy.	0.5741253237544552
The hypotensive symptoms are twice as frequent during early pregnancy compared to late pregnancy.	0.3184555981660565
Headaches, fatigue and cold extremities are the most usual complaints.	0.5523449975610666
The frequency and intensity of these three symptoms decrease during gestation.	0.5939288486282349
Blood pressure in the supine position is reduced in symptomatic pregnant women.	0.4035948403247024
However, the occurrence of these symptoms is not correlated to the fall in blood pressure in the standing position.	0.6947444482301471
The Birth-weight is not influenced by blood pressure in the supine position, but depends on the fall in blood pressure during standing.	0.6007314034387858
Pregnant women with a more pronounced fall in blood pressure give birth to newborns with a lower birthweight.	0.6064200047306617
These results imply a hitherto unknown cause of intrauterine growth restriction.	0.3537177906425481
The combination of saltwater baths and subsequent ultraviolet irradiation is an effective treatment for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.	0.5327913018694135
The aim of the present study was to determine the photosensitizing properties of two commercially available bath salts, original salt from the Dead Sea and sodium chloride.	0.5216683498035689
To address this issue, test areas on the volar aspects of the forearms were soaked with salt solutions for 15 minutes prior to ultraviolet-B (UVB) irradiation.	0.4549588085782087
The salt concentrations tested were 1%, 3% 5% and 15%.	0.8093838539913305
Tap water followed by UVB and UVB alone served as controls.	0.262282904411666
Erythema was determined by visual and photometric measurement, and delayed tanning was assessed by colorimetry.	0.6180537440258743
Erythema obtained by wetting the skin prior to UVB irradiation was more pronounced than erythema induced by UVB alone.	0.3929267040326718
The most prominent erythema was yielded by tap water+UVB.	0.4168320643626898
The salts had a differing photosensitizing capacity and the strongest erythema was produced by the 5% solutions.	0.4661295933009555
There was only a moderate influence on delayed tanning by bathing the skin prior to irradiation.	0.4278588628214196
The results from the present study indicate that soaking the skin with salt solutions or tap water increases skin sensitivity to subsequent UVB irradiation.	0.5797859023743002
This may contribute to the effectiveness of salt water baths followed by UV irradiation and may account for an increased sunburn risk after bathing.	0.44363206204574196
Introduction: The aim of the study was to evaluate the modern principles of surgery in diverticulitis, e. g. early elective resection and primary anastomosis.	0.6227389549819354
Methods: The data of 445 consecutive patients were retrospectively analysed after classifying all cases in four subgroups according to a modified Hinchey classification (stages 0-III).	0.600176397054702
Results: Within our study group the morbidity was 26.5 % (n = 118) and the mortality was 1.6 % (n = 7).	0.824689288536082
In 96 % (n = 425) of all cases and in 64 % (21/33) of patients with perforated diverticulitis and peritonitis (stage III), a primary anastomosis was performed.	0.9612398469173465
Four patients of the study group showed insufficient anastomosis (0.9 %).	0.8026315752965484
No leakage was observed from any of the anastomoses performed in stage III diverticulitis.	0.5114722424995759
Stage of inflammation and age of patient correlate with morbidity and mortality.	0.513695784979767
Some 53 % (94/177) of the patients in stage II and 67 % (22/33) of the patients in stage III had never showed symptoms of diverticulitis before.	0.9367753860770875
Conclusion: Prophylactic surgery to avoid life-threatening situations, including abscess formation or perforation, is not possible in many cases.	0.895772812082957
However, especially patients at risk (age, coexisting illness) should undergo early surgery.	0.7651373536827731
Primary anastomosis can be performed safely even at an advanced stage.	0.49332791360684597
To evaluate whether MRI is usefull in staging renal cell carcinomas with caval thrombus the accuracy of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in staging renal tumors with caval thrombus were preoperatively examined.	0.5495298159818016
Tumor staging by CT and MR imaging were correlated with histopathological tumor stadium.	0.5483297403184719
In MRI 4 out of 7 thrombi were correctly diagnosed with high accuracy, in CT none.	0.6105653513073012
In advanced renal carcinoma MRI with Gadolinium was superior to CT imaging, especially in diagnosing tumor thrombus.	0.5391878205549315
Consequently the extent of tumor thrombus may be assessed by MRI which therefore may replace conventional cavography.	0.5092404801943823
Children of mothers chronically infected with hepatitis-C-virus (HCV) during pregnancy and delivery were prospectively followed.	0.5650828013863172
90 children born to 85 infected mothers were included in our study; nine of the mothers were known to be co-infected with HIV-1.	0.6800409719158093
These 90 children were first tested within 60 days after birth and followed for at least three months.	0.5305940498355604
Three of the 90 children became infected perinatally with HCV as shown by persistence of antibodies after 2 years of life and a positive result in the RT-PCR.	0.735212106544917
One of these 3 children has evidence of ongoing hepatitis as shown by slightly elevated alanine aminotransferase values, but is otherwise clinically well, likewise the other 2 infected children.	0.5815344234671546
54 of the 87 uninfected children were followed until they lost maternal antibodies after an average of one year.	0.4487445168858269
Cor triatriatum dexter is a rare congenital malformation in which a membrane divides the right atrium into two chambers.	0.712162277397354
The membrane represents a persistence of the right sinus venosus valve (RSV).	0.4791475153077465
Normally the RSV regresses between the 9th and 15th week of gestation, as the cephalic portion forms the crista terminalis and the caudal portion develops into the Eustachian and Thebesian valve.	0.46515415440772623
Any failure in the regression process may result in remnants of RSV as a simple muscle bar, a Chiari-network or a fenestrated or unfenestrated membrane (cor triatriatum dexter).	0.4359280044878629
We describe a patient with cor triatriatum dexter in whom diagnosis was made several years after successful valvulotomy procedure for severe congenital valvular pulmonary stenosis.	0.5482821067079116
Apoptosis and proliferation are important regulators of normal development and homeostasis in the bone marrow.	0.5099023025891916
Therefore, dynamics of hematopoiesis is mainly defined by these two parameters.	0.4570191699374567
However, since only few data are available from previous studies, we performed a retrospective analysis to elucidate some aspects of this complex pathomechanism.	0.9025157808672304
A total of 400 patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPDs) and corresponding reactive bone marrow lesions were enrolled into this study.	0.664716894748611
Apoptosis was detected in bone marrow tissue by the ISEL-technique and topoisomerase II  expression was demonstrated by the monoclonal antibody Ki-S1.	0.506619566929857
Furthermore, by determination of the proliferating-cell nuclear antigen labeling (PCNA) index, we were able to calculate the proportion of cells in the G2/M phase, because both nuclear antigens are expressed in different phases of the cell cycle.	0.6737152407370723
Patients with IMF, PV, and ET revealed a normal range of apoptosis, whereas in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) a significant increase could be observed.	0.7491117717954152
On the other hand, IMF and PV were characterized by a raised proliferative activity.	0.3879642196418084
Dynamics of hematopoiesis was assessed by calculation of the so called hematopoietic turnover index.	0.5717679304781432
In CML and reactive lesions no alterations of this parameter were detectable, but IMF and PV showed a significant increase.	0.6545974244770391
Survival analysis disclosed a relevant worsening of life expectancy for patients with reduced apoptosis and proliferation.	0.5390962929079984
In conclusion, our in-situ results confirm and extend previous experimental data on hematopoietic cell kinetics.	0.5084069096090464
In this context, a greater regenerative capacity of hematopoiesis may be reflected by an increased rate of apoptosis and/or proliferation and therefore is associated with a more favorable outcome.	0.7152825940720136
In a complex animal model in sheep, polydioxanone (PDS) and polylactic membranes were used for the reconstruction of large orbital-wall defects.	0.5824746000750862
In a long-term experiment over 1 year, polylactic implants alone showed the best performance as compared with combinations involving autogenous bone grafts and titanium miniplate fixation.	0.4747897452816542
As soon as these polylactic implants are approved for human surgery, they will be used to solve the still challenging problem of anatomical reconstruction of large comminuted fractures of more than one orbital wall.	0.6601180392464597
Surgery by three-dimensional (3D) endoscopy is being used routinely in abdominal surgery and, in special cases, in thoracic surgery; however, it has not been reported as being used in microlaryngeal surgery.	0.7194170328155625
We inserted a 3-D endoscope into a jet laryngoscope and studied the pressure properties at the tip of the laryngoscope as well as intrapulmonary pressures while applying superimposed high-frequency jet ventilation.	0.5184539947368704
The studies were conducted initially using a lung simulator, and then in seven patients undergoing microlaryngeal surgery.	0.6151640745817476
Due to the rather large 3-D endoscope, the diameter of the jet laryngoscope was reduced by between 25.2% and 70.9%, depending on its size.	0.7689076957414611
The measurements on the lung simulator revealed that reduction of laryngoscope diameter leads to an increase in the following parameters: expiratory resistance, tidal volume, and peak inspiratory pressure.	0.658796786587982
The mean FiO2 was 0.74 +/- 0.1; the mean paO2 was 169.2 +/- 80.4 mm Hg; and the mean paCO2 was 40.9 +/- 2.4 mm Hg.	0.7716504129705449
The mean airway pressure was 19 +/- 5.3 mm Hg prior to insertion of the endoscope and 12.3 +/- 6.9 mm Hg after insertion.	0.7507718270811962
The mean positive end-expiratory pressure values increased from 2 +/- 0.6 to 3.6 +/- 2.3 mm Hg.	0.7893158419888346
Reduction of the working pressure resulted in restoration of the initial inspiratory pressures and tidal volumes.	0.573299392779565
In the clinical application of 3-D endoscopy via a jet laryngoscope, it was possible to achieve sufficient ventilation, inspection of the surgical field, and performance of the surgical procedure.	0.8700183390074546
A CO2 laser was used without changing the ventilation regime.	0.36749114900103785
Although technical alterations would be desirable for its application to microlaryngeal surgery, it is presently possible to safely use the 3-D endoscope via the jet laryngoscope for microlaryngeal surgery, presenting the surgeon with new possibilities in voice-improving microsurgery of the larynx.	0.5737680090332209
Kryopreserved specimens of cystic ducts were used for displacement tests to investigate the security of different laparoscopic clips.	0.47150594900621606
The cystic duct was fixed, and the transverse placed clips were distracted in axial direction and the forces registered.	0.516857434089419
The median values of the six investigated clips ranged between 4.1 N and 11.2 N with a highly significant difference (P < 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA).	0.6019923272090232
In detail, both resorbable clips (polydioxanone, polyglyconate/polyglycol acetate) were superior to the four titanium clips (P < 0.005, Wilcoxon test).	0.5792565446190565
In addition to the advantage of complete biodegradibility, these data favour the use of absorbable clips because holding force is better than that of titanium clips.	0.6233597173099806
Hemoglobin solutions and fluorocarbon emulsions are evaluated as artificial oxygen carriers.	0.32201510765506697
The efficacy of hemoglobin solutions with respect to O2 transport and especially the effective O2 release to tissues has been demonstrated in a number of situations, such as extreme hemodilution and hemorrhagic shock.	0.5502082544189629
The hemoglobin molecule could be stabilized by genetic and chemical modifications.	0.36895231350798574
This results in a clinically utilizable intravascular half-life of about 8-24 h, an adequate O2 affinity, and a lack of nephrotoxicity.	0.8251059884611825
A degree of vasoconstriction must be mentioned as the persistent side effect of the hemoglobin solutions evaluated here.	0.5051438745009977
In spite of this, hemoglobin solutions are also well tolerated in humans.	0.5673772101596526
Fluorocarbon emulsions are compounds with a very high gas solubility and are, therefore, well suited for the transport of O2 and CO2.	0.5556685129380444
The capacity for the release of O2 to the tissues is especially excellent.	0.44803953004916686
This was demonstrated under extreme hemodilution, during extracorporeal circulation and also under reanimation.	0.5302250854275066
Perflubron, the most important representative of the fluorocarbon emulsions, has also been successfully used in man and is well tolerated.	0.8035117046279083
The introduction of artificial oxygen carriers to clinical practice will greatly change transfusion medicine and also the acute care of trauma patients.	0.5386907650513583
Launch is expected within the next few years.	0.3453990466853844
The new volatile anaesthetic desflurane is characterized by very low blood-gas and tissue-blood partition coefficients, so that rapid induction of anaesthesia and shorter recovery times can be expected.	0.5823252649878944
The aim of this investigation was to compare the effects of desflurane and isoflurane on haemodynamics and recovery time when used as part of a balanced anaesthesia technique for elective surgery.	0.6526079807799581
In acute coronary syndromes, arteriosclerotic plaques are characterized by inflammation and decreased smooth muscle cell density.	0.46403062883277263
The underlying pathogenic processes remain unclear.	0.21611171969031462
Among others, increased programmed cell death (apoptosis) is postulated.	0.6438172779494096
Coronary atherectomy specimens from 26 patients with unstable angina (group 1) and from 24 patients with stable angina (group 2) were examined, using immunohistochemistry (TUNEL test to detect fragmented DNA) and transmission electron microscopy.	0.80673493957205
The objectives of the present study were to evaluate plaque group differences in the cellular composition, to detect and quantify cell death, and to diferentiate between apoptosis and necrosis.	0.7618871865560034
On occasion of the 100th anniversary of heart surgery we present in this article the first successful experimental open heart operations in Russia in the years from 1926 to 1937.	0.5661020083549213
These operations on the stationary heart were carried out by using the first device for extracorporeal circulation.	0.5601412587345881
This work pioneered by Russian scientist S. Brukhonenko and the Surgeon N. Terebinski is nearly unknown to the medical public.	0.4967883743593061
The first and largest series at the time worldwide of more than 260 operations on the valves of the open heart, the still valid prophylactic procedure to avoid air embolism, and principles of open heart surgery stated by N. Terebinski were decades ahead of the development at the time.	0.6905515492782911
In the authors' opinion they represent a milestone in the history of open heart surgery.	0.5324088830422937
Aneurysms of the temporal part of the carotid artery are unusually rare.	0.5948205166905471
The literature contains only a few previous reports dealing with hemorrhage from such malformations.	0.4877777216376422
In the present case massive bleeding occurred from a right-sided intrapetrous aneurym after myringotomy, which was performed as treatment for bilateral secretory otitis media.	0.7523855419029504
Due to the absence of any specific symptoms and the masking effect of middle ear glue preoperative identification of the aneurysm was not possible.	0.7626059719754875
Subsequent angiography showed the large fusiform extension of the intrapetrous aneurysm as well as multiple intracranial aneurysms.	0.4102894674720531
Leakage from the aneurism was closed definitively with muscle, fascia lata and a gelatin-resorcin-formalin-glue (Cardial).	0.33525772521718256
In order to apply the tissue patch the hypotympanic site of the aneurism was exposed using a posterior otosurgical approach.	0.46655842219908683
Due to extensive intracranial collateralization to the vertebral arteries bleeding persisted even after ligation of both carotid arteries.	0.3662037803467637
Temporary cardiac asystole was then induced to allow safe closure of the aneurysm.	0.4243869141300466
Following surgery the patient sustained loss of hearing in her ear and a partial peripheral facial palsy.	0.4732316896207062
Blindness causes human suffering and high social costs.	0.2682542317739729
Virtually all blind people are registered with the social services.	0.3674461843087013
Data from these institutions may help in (long-term) planning for blindness prevention.	0.5293150744762614
The stage-oriented treatment of stem varicosis is the operation method of choice.	0.5264380972924287
Nowadays, partial stem varicosis, which is an earlier stage of the disease, leads to operative treatment more frequently than 10 years ago; thus a sufficient vein stump remains after surgical treatment.	0.7658239683918645
After surgery on a group of 1000 patients, we examined the stumps for patency, the occurrence of varicose changes, for their availability in the long term, and the sufficiency of their length for aortocoronary or peripheral bypass surgery.	0.759037043292213
The treatment of insufficient perforant veins was also included in the surgical therapy, as well as postoperative sclerotherapy of remaining lateral veins.	0.591741316905535
With a follow-up period of up to 33 months postoperatively, the results show a high patency rate in the remaining stumps (97%), as well as a high sufficiency rate (94%), with a mean graft length of 29.4 cm.	0.8084886807439755
Thus these stumps constitute a good natural graft for future vascular reconstructions.	0.3007463176213752
This study supports the call for the stage-oriented surgical treatment of stem varicosis.	0.5239436903806717
Background: Corneal HLA-DR antigens are going to be lost during organ culture storage.	0.44211241995460676
This study investigated if this phenomenon is based on down-regulation of the HLA-DR antigen, or on a loss of the HLA-DR-positive corneal Langerhans cells (LCs).	0.5870654987837988
The authors present a rare case of solitary non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in the skull of an 11-year-old girl.	0.7080968736277918
The clinical, radiological and histological findings as well as a review of the literature are included in this report.	0.8631323956002759
The morphological features of intra- and extracerebral tumor masses and the change in tumor extension due to chemotherapy and radiation therapy were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging.	0.6303725650447038
Although rare, NHL should be considered in the differential diagnosis of skull tumors in children.	0.48724494992232725
Neurodegenerative and dementing disorders such as Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease are among the most common diseases of advanced age.	0.4765277877369171
Despite progress in the clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders, definite diagnosis for most of these disorders is still possible only by neuropathological examination of the brain.	0.7808883082539847
The neuropathological diagnosis and classification of neurodegenerative disorders has made clear advances in recent years, particularly due to the results of genetic and biochemical studies, resulting in the development of new disease-specific antibodies.	0.6677901943765167
Internationally recognized consensus criteria for most neurodegenerative disorders allow a definite and standardized diagnosis to be made.	0.3621274221242932
To obtain further knowledge about the etiopathogenesis, particularly with regard to new therapeutic strategies, studies with clinically and neuropathologically well-documented cases are needed.	0.7017437401291581
The project "Brain-Net" has therefore been established with the aim of setting up a German Brain and Tissue Bank for Diseases of the Central Nervous System.	0.518649385205888
The project is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research.	0.4122067071658043
Fetal surgery is defined as the intrauterine surgical correction of malformations that endanger the unborn child's life in prenatal stages of development or lead to death or severe damage of the child postnatally.	0.5341181022850847
Such surgery is a clinical reality now.	0.5869680936484182
Indications for intrataurine surgical procedures also exist for head and neck abnormalities, especially in the upper respiratory tract.	0.6427793057673599
These include exposure and temporary obstruction of the fetal trachea for correction of pulmonary hypoplasia in cases with congenital diaphragmatic hernias, prenatal tracheotomy in cases of laryngeal atresia for the correction of lethal pulmonary overdistension, and resection of embryonic tumors that obstruct the respiratory tract.	0.5772136510979063
The relatively high surgical risk resulting in particular from preterm labor occurring postoperatively may be reduced by employing minimally invasive techniques.	0.45069266936718133
Endoscopic procedures render opening of the uterus unnecessary and are of particular importance.	0.43762483190727813
In part of the procedures, only endoscopic surgery has led to therapeutic success rates justifying its clinical use.	0.5796635580196229
Further reduction of the operative risk suggests prenatal interventions, even in cases with non-lethal conditions.	0.7632309837250509
More diseases of the head and neck may thus be included in the spectrum of indications.	0.56286429870863
One example is prenatal correction of a cleft lip and palate, which until now has only been performed in animal experiments.	0.6586573815219459
The particular characteristics of fetal wound healing allow this to take place without scarring up to a certain stage in pregnancy.	0.5007666337557449
This offers the prospect of a surgical correction that is invisible externally and avoids growth-impeding scars.	0.38446277075436386
The particular ethical and legal aspects of fetal surgery are discussed.	0.44493354351318354
We report on a 57-year-old patient suffering from a complex malposition of proximal femur after osteosynthesis using a condylar plate.	0.5901589537918676
For polyaxial correction of the proximal femur we successfully used an intramedullary hip screw system.	0.6043157337469972
In 6 patients with primary malignant bone tumors (4 Ewing, 1 recurrent Adamantinoma, 1 maligne Haemangioperizytoma) the local therapy was performed as intraoperative extracorporeal irradiation and replantation.	0.8015965461444043
During the follow-up 10 (6-24) months no local recurrence in the replanted segment occurred.	0.7198665720394506
One recurrence occurred in the host bed; in two cases the replanted segment had to be removed because of severe infection.	0.8153221192090491
The other cases showed good functional and radiological results.	0.546995413201513
These clinical findings and the reports in the literature seem to allow the application of the intraoperative extracorporeal irradiation and replantation procedure for defect reconstruction in cases of chemo- and radiotherapy-sensitive bone tumors.	0.6694695570870736
Effects of anaesthesia and analgesia on postoperative morbidity and mortality remain controversial.	0.507448272959831
Numerous studies have demonstrated that epidural anaesthesia and pain relief by epidural analgesia reduces perioperative stress responses and thus may reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality.	0.5804687562786028
In patients undergoing vascular surgery, epidural anaesthesia diminished postoperative hypercoagulability.	0.539350157750163
These patients may benefit from less thromboembolic complications as well as a reduced risk of a re-operation.	0.6378013111202171
However, regional anaesthesia does not affect cardiopulmonary morbidity or overall mortality significantly in most clinical studies.	0.4651441297648687
One reason for this disappointing finding may be the missing integration of improved postoperative pain relief into general surgical care.	0.5546015175545553
A multimodal therapeutic approach, which consists of preoperativ patient information, sufficient analgesia, early mobilisation and enteral feeding, may solve this discrepancy.	0.6163859889927317
Therefore, prospective controlled studies are needed to assess the influence of this perioperative approach on outcome.	0.603513756855974
Although cerebrovascular diseases are the most common causes of dementia after Alzheimer's desease, vascular dementia (VD) has remained so far an ill-defined term.	0.6482441896520473
The main problems in the definition of VD arise from finding criteria for both terms "vascular" and "dementia".	0.5826300350572471
The detailed criteria for the diagnosis of VD proposed by several groups or institutions (ADDTC, DSM-IV, ICD-10, NINDS-ARIEN) are critically reviewed.	0.5518617036613014
The diagnostic value of some clinical findings, especially the very frequent white matter luciencies in CT (leuko-araiosis), are discussed.	0.6228290622006281
The available studies suggest a differentiation of VD into some subtypes (listed according to frequency): subcortical VD, VD with acute onset, multiinfarct-dementia, mixed types, and specific forms.	0.49470656050585743
Nevertheless, these subtypes give only little information about the etiology of the underlying vascular process and, therefore, no clear indication for specific therapeutic strategies.	0.715873244867944
The aetiology of varicosis is still unclear.	0.3846173208660828
Investigation of changes in normal veins which result in the formation of varicosis led to examination of elastic properties and histomorphological alterations in the region of the extracellular matrix in the vessel wall of the long saphenous vein in normal and varicose veins.	0.6338140449631106
The rigidity of varicose veins was higher than that of normal veins; there was no difference between the varicose vein above a competent valve and the "normal" vein below this competent valve.	0.5664584528994202
The matrix proteins demonstrated an increase in total fibres, whereas the elastic fibres were reduced and fragmented, explained the rigidity of varices.	0.5830475582391854
These results suggest that the role of the venous valves in the development of varicose veins is secondary to changes of the vein wall.	0.6644671056008691
An investigation of 122 knee joints was performed concerning the incidence and morphological characteristics of the meniscofemoral ligaments (MFL) Humphry and Wrisberg.	0.5489738759983299
Of the knees examined, 96% showed one or more ligaments, the incidence was independent of gender or age.	0.7868365905152694
The osseous parameters of the dorsal and ventral notch as well as the diacondylar width did not correlate with the incidence of MFL.	0.5998435506191714
The ventral notch width index (NWI) after Souryal was 0.22 in females and 0.24 in males.	0.5210926526271267
A dorsal notch width index (dNWI), which has not been described so far, was 0.26 in females and 0.28 in males.	0.7085025625906801
The ligamentum meniscofemorale posterius (Wrisberg) showed distinct morphological variations.	0.42848192438268173
This resulted in a classification of type I-III.	0.69747510249694
The results of the study underline the importance of the MFL for knee joint function including stabilization, proprioception, and meniscal positioning.	0.707733312699994
Eleven patients with high-grade mucosal dysplasia in a columnar-lined oesophagus and 2 patients with a squamous carcinoma (uT1) underwent photodynamic therapy (PDT) and argon-plasma coagulation (APC).	0.6989613002979199
For PDT, 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) was given orally (60 mg/kg) and treated endoscopically with a light dose of 150 J/cm2 (100 mW/cm2) at 635 nm 4-6 h later.	0.7856430941769019
A second PDT was performed under the same conditions 2-3 weeks later.	0.6076373438859188
Patients who received APC were treated 4 times on average to reach radical Barrett mucosa eradication.	0.44695592654907146
All patients were consistently given medication to suppress acid production.	0.4604493520769138
No complications occurred in either group.	0.2849061968425493
Follow-up endoscopies and multiple biopsies for 3-42 months showed squamous regeneration in the dysplastic columnar-lined oesophagus in all 11 patients.	0.45968893905150837
Two patients with squamous carcinoma were found to have a recurrence 9 and 12 months later.	0.8559519893412343
PDT with 5-ALA-induced endogenous porphyrins, as well as APC combined with omeprazole protection, can eradicate superficial high-grade dysplastic mucosa in Barrett's oesophagus.	0.5340812066585893
However, we did not succeed in destroying a manifest carcinoma.	0.6092437050759268
Technical advantages of spiral technology are of great usefulness in diagnostic imaging of thorax and abdomen in children.	0.42361104563008883
The rapid imaging time allows the examination of an entire organ while scanning with breath holding or while the child is quietly breathing, resulting in a decreased need for sedation.	0.4837888338709084
In addition especially examinations of the chest an to some extend CT-investigations of the abdomen are performed with reduced radiation dose achieved by reducing the tube loading.	0.5919173935954128
Radiation dose reduction of 70% is possible without loss of relevant diagnostic information.	0.616824547686442
Spiral low-dose CT in pediatric chest imaging is useful in evaluating parenchymal lung diseases, mediastinal masses and central airway malformations.	0.5203948907632672
Whether abdominal helical CT can be replaced by MRI has to be decided in each individual case.	0.46046391339621884
When an exact protocol is used, sufficient contrast material given, scan-delay optimized and postprocessing reconstructions are performed, usefull additional diagnostic informations are obtained by the method.	0.5008263247370605
Invasive monitoring is a standard procedure in modern intensive care medicine.	0.6837907685797568
Despite significant progress in the routine use and catheter technology, there are relevant remaining risks concerning acute central venous and arterial access and chronic persistence of catheters within the vascular lumen.	0.6258392167064248
Resulting from the infectiologically established novel definition of antiseptic which contains the local application of antiseptics for prophylactical, preventive or therapeutical indication on skin, mucous membrane, wounds, in body cavities or on surgical exposed resp.	0.474214339003576
opened endosomatic areas the antiseptical indications in a branch of dermatology and venereal diseases are represented.	0.35008984169094975
With the analysis of the actual knowledge in vitro and in vivo requirements to local antiinfectiva are defined combined with the recommendations for the clinical use.	0.7593930497945559
At present mainly prophylactically used agents are submitted to a benefit risk analysis with refer to the choice of agents.	0.3883631482310491
Thereby agents for the application on skin as well as on genitals, in mouth cavity and on wounds were taken into consideration.	0.6370431754579668
Hydatid disease, still frequent in endemic areas, is usually localized in the liver.	0.7009571741551457
Despite the benign nature of the disease it is one of the problematic fields of surgery due to the high complication rate and long hospital stay.	0.7268174947960854
Based on our experience we recommend evacuation of the cyst and omentoplasty as the surgical method of choice, as it is associated with a relatively low incidence of complications and can be performed easily.	0.9352879280724443
Background: Central catheters in neonatological intensive care patients are used for the prolonged application of medicataion or parenteral infusions.	0.5570433911382623
Dislocations and septic and thromboembolic complications may occur.	0.33410121032995765
Low density lipoproteins are heterogeneous in particle size, density, and physical as well as chemical properties.	0.47964783630709285
Regarding size and density, LDL can be divided into two main profiles, LDL pattern A with elevated concentration of large, buoyant LDL particles and LDL pattern B with increased concentration of small, dense LDL particles.	0.46665816497274704
The latter is particularly expressed in insulin resistance and is associated with elevated serum triglycerides and reduced concentrations of HDL and particularly HDL2 cholesterol.	0.4582196797225258
The LDL profile of increased concentration of small, dense LDL particles has shown to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events.	0.5121192549317346
The LDL profile is partly genetically determined, but can be improved by non-pharmacological (exercise, diet) and pharmacological intervention.	0.7249809843133485
It remains to be confirmed whether the LDL subfraction profile is an independent lipid risk factor besides HDL2 cholesterol and triglycerides, but it is certainly a valuable indicator assessing metabolic cardiovascular risk.	0.5420372295383604
Traumatic injuries of arteries lead to acute bleeding or ischemia.	0.36460015223457987
In the hand, which is perfused by two arteries, this symptom could be missed.	0.7672599629059454
The hypothenar hammer syndrome is a traumatic occlusion of the distal arteria ulnaris.	0.6347937161867775
Dependent on the mechanism of the trauma the clinical symptoms may appear late.	0.8550390324146512
A specific angiographic or duplex sonographic diagnostic investigation is necessary to show the arterial occlusion.	0.5336472429037356
There is no proven therapeutic procedure.	0.4808081206019958
Exact diagnosis of the occlusion as an effect of the trauma is important for the patient and is the basis of any therapeutic intervention.	0.9661265090802063
The administration of epidural opioids is alternatively used in the management of postoperative analgesia.	0.6005462914657979
However, the administration is associated with side effects, including respiratory depression, somnolence and pruritus.	0.6695578980374568
A rational opioid selection between the hydrophilic and lipophilic opioids morphine, hydromorphone, alfentanil, fentanyl and sufentanil is discussed in this mini-review.	0.5227733709002933
Thus, the administration of the lipophilic opioid sufentanil might has some advantages.	0.6044989378405977
Notwithstanding, epidural opioid administration alone offers no marked clinical advantages compared to the intravenous route.	0.49957597539094284
In future, reduced doses of lipophilic opioids and local anaesthetics like bupivacaine 0.05-0.1% may provide benefits over the use of either drug alone and may offer marked clinical advantages over the intravenous route of opioids alone.	0.6398479572460111
The same holds true for  2-adrenoceptor agonists as adjuvants.	0.4437507794288154
However, multicenter dose-ranging studies are necessary to determine both the ideal concentrations of the drug combinations and the general outcome.	0.6591307221030062
Moreover, we must also determine cost effectiveness for our postoperative analgesic techniques.	0.6332952281716834
Today the relevance of renal tumor embolization is not determined only by the technical and clinical success of the method.	0.6313229509292165
Progress in diagnosis of early stages of renal carcinomas as well as the improvement of both surgical techniques and anesthetic procedures have lead to a change in the selection of patients for embolization.	0.8287679614155944
Preoperative embolization of advanced renal cell carcinomas with tumor thrombus into the vena cava or of T4 tumors is now an established clinical procedure.	0.46803744337275854
The complete occlusion of the vascular bed of the tumors leads to a considerable reduction in intraoperative blood loss and to simplification of the surgical preparation.	0.7705648921744673
By using Ethibloc for embolization, palliation of a hemorrhage or of tumor-related pain in inoperable patients is usually successful.	0.5297955583380138
Although local control of the tumor disease, including complete tumor ablation, is achieved by embolization, the median survival rate of our palliatively embolized patients is only 3.5 months.	0.9376950995353507
This short life expectancy in the group of inoperable patients has to be acknowledged individually in patients considered for palliative embolization who are free of symptoms related to the tumor.	0.6301561989125611

Content of this paper is the current state of the art of robots in surgery and the ongoing work on the field of surgical robotics at the Clinic for Maxillofacial Surgery at the Charité.	0.6513750097787068
Robots in surgery allows the surgeon to transform the accuracy of the imaging systems directly during the intervention and to plan an intervention beforehand.	0.5952024988563503
In this paper firstly the state of the art is described.	0.7318889015925755
Subsequently the scientific work at the clinic is described in detail.	0.5126804349080288
The paper closes with a outlook for future applications of robotics systems in maxillofacial surgery.	0.32696024839781934
Giant-cell bone tumors display a locally aggressive growth pattern, frequently recur if no adjuvant treatment is given, and may potentially metastasize.	0.5620257603586348
By virtue of their biological behavior and typically juxta-articular localization, giant-cell bone tumors require specific surgical management.	0.4201610240759805
Thus, an intralesional tumor excision must be supplemented by adjuvant bone cementing, possibly combined with instillation of phenol or cryotherapy.	0.4716569267708347
These combined treatment modalities assure a high-quality procedure, defined as the actual way medical care is delivered, by promoting the quality of the outcome, defined as the effect of a medical procedure on the patient's state of health.	0.7691287247180667
We report two patients with partial trisomy of the long arm of chromosome 7 and partial monosomy of the short arm of chromosome 17.	0.5989487928196443
Chromosomal analysis of the family shows a familial balanced translocation of the chromosomes 7 and 17 in the parents and other relatives.	0.5650216164151515
Pedigree analysis reveals abortions, frequent miscarriages and early infant deaths.	0.26998688255608
Our patients show the same chromosomal abnormality and nearly the same clinical symptoms: prominent forehead, hydrocephalus internus with wide cranial sutures and fontanels, hypertelorism, cleft soft palate, low set dysmorphic ears, psychomotor retardation and micrognathie.	0.4634839285898487
Renal cell carcinomas (RCC) are endowed with impressive metastatic potential.	0.49320182446459565
Patients with RCC who present with apparently solitary metastatic lesions represent a small cohort.	0.3443745643096223
Due to the different long-term results achieved with surgical resection of metastatic RCC lesions, a generally accepted judgement about this treatment modality is not possible.	0.8095760585857875
Several studies suggest that aggressive surgical management can provide an effective treatment, especially in patients with solitary pulmonary metastases.	0.6644807789215141
Most noteworthy is the fact that because of the organ distribution of RCC metastases, surgical therapy is dominated by general and thoracic surgeons, neurosurgeons, and orthopaedic surgeons.	0.6305492000736214
Therefore, an interdisciplinary approach is one of the most important key points for a successful outcome in these patients.	0.8145571888002734
The term Langerhans cell histiocytosis, previously "Histiocytosis X", encompasses three different syndromes: eosinophilic granuloma of bone, Hand-Schüller-Christian disease and Abt-Letterer Siwe disease.	0.39915503787540724

The diffuse angiomatosis of the spleen is a rare splenic proliferation.	0.5575802639344238
Spontaneous rupture is the main, potentially lethal complication, found in 25 % of cases.	0.7542563902682651
The problem with these vascular tumors is preoperative diagnosis, because they are asymptomatic for a long time.	0.6113402168117779
First-choice therapy is limited resection.	0.454618843236929
In the case of rupture, splenectomy is a life-saving procedure.	0.551495774670376

Exceptional features of splenic hemangiomas, causes of spontaneous rupture and the therapy are described.	0.47949710068850265
The hypothesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as a T cell mediated disease has led to the development of numerous therapeutic approaches that target the function of T cells.	0.6055846137386559
The development of monoclonal antibodies against the T cell surface molecule CD4 has raised hopes to achieve a major progress in the treatment of RA.	0.6080570588079917
However, after encouraging results in early open studies, double blind trials were unable to demonstrate the efficacy of anti-CD4-therapy in RA.	0.6581348628485301
There are numerous reasons to explain the failure of this treatment approach.	0.6332655950009684
Besides the fact that the T cell hypothesis of RA has  repeatedly been challenged, pharmacological problems or an inappropriate selection of outcome criteria have to be considered.	0.5059162688518624
The final evaluation of anti-CD4 therapy  in RA will be possible only after  the testing of newly developed  non-depleting anti-CD4 anti- bodies.	0.529836944670395
Purpose: For some time, the ambulatory diagnosis of respiratory disturbances during sleep has included the use of seven-channel recording units.	0.5676114540363469
One of these systems is the POLY-MESAM unit (MAP, Germany).	0.5879697872279205
Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) function as transducers of information across the cell membrane by coupling receptors to effectors.	0.516025365173814
A large number of G protein-linked receptors funnel extra-cellular signals as diverse as hormones, growth factors, neurotransmitters, and primary sensory stimuli through a set of G proteins to a small number of second-messenger systems.	0.4746529938934189
The G proteins act as molecular switches with an "on" and "off" state governed by a GTPase cycle.	0.5818131084981478
By virtue of its high affinity and specificity for guanine nucleotide binding and its intrinsic GTPase activity, the -subunit of the G protein (G) plays the critical role in regulation of the effectors by their corresponding G protein.	0.5859648101964514
Mutations of G may result in either constitutive activation or loss of expression mutations.	0.39229126228543393
Given the variety of functions subserved by G protein-coupled signal transduction, it is not surprising that abnormalities in G protein-coupled pathways can lead to diseases with manifestations as dissimilar as blindness, hormone resistance, precocious puberty and neoplasia.	0.4936264846555329
For a given defect in a G protein-coupled pathway, the extent of the manifestations will also be determined by the cellular distribution of the affected component.	0.7475356835818406
Defects in components expressed exclusively in a single cell type will cause more a focal disorder than defects in a widely expressed component, particularly in germline mutations (e.g., Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy), whereas somatic mutations of genes encoding even an ubiquitously expressed component can cause focal disease when the somatic mutation itself is focal (e.g., McCune-Albright syndrome).	0.45157471284962875
Mivacurium is a short-acting, nondepolarising muscle relaxant of the benzylisoquinoline type that undergoes rapid breakdown by plasma cholinesterase.	0.3681532134600225
After 2.5 times the ED95 (0.2 mg/kg), tracheal intubation can be accomplished within 2-3 min following injection.	0.6778486020646675
The ensuing DUR 25% (i.e., time from injection to 25% recovery of control twitch tension) is three times as long as with succinylcholine.	0.6548535914136704
The principal side effects of mivacurium are facial flushing and a transient fall in blood pressure due to moderate histamine release following doses 3-4 times the ED95.	0.5471666837763877
In patients with end-stage liver or renal disease as well as those with atypical plasma cholinesterase, the duration of action of mivacurium is prolonged.	0.6565552353564936
The performance of new cryoprobes was studied by measuring the spatial and temporal patterns of the temperature distribution in liver tissue around one to three active cryoprobes.	0.5427135102459469
After 15 min of maximal freezing a tissue region 22 mm in diameter was frozen to temperatures below - 50  °C by one active cryoprobe.	0.5019625081251501
With three cryoprobes, using the synergistic cooling effect, a tissue region 45 mm in diameter was cooled to temperatures below - 50  °C.	0.6510616538971777
Optimal placement of the cryoprobes was found to be of critical importance.	0.658426796943439
Attachment representation was assessed in 48 elderly people with an average age of 69 years.	0.4919293763094147
The adult attachment interview was used plus an additional question about wishes for the future.	0.38434028751913224
Coherent correlations with subjective life satisfaction and individual future perspective were demonstrated.	0.29916394910063454
Elderly participants with secure attachment representation were more satisfied, they were also less anxious, and more often positive about their future.	0.6863058202187068
If their adult children had secure attachment representation, they were reported by their elderly parents to be socially, emotionally, and materially more supportive.	0.5588458194923571
Magnetic resonance imaging represents today the most important tool in neuroradiology for both clinical pratice and research.	0.5378986818454645
MRI allows imaging of the human body in 2 or 3 dimensions with variable tissue contrast.	0.684279417916737
The natural diffusion of tissue protons can now be used as a supplementary contrast mechanism.	0.5319530662499783
Different MRI techniques can be used to obtain clinically useful diffusion-weighted images.	0.532647691748548
These techniques all require the use of strong gradient pulses in order to obtain the diffusion contrast.	0.43960707512070035
In the current article, the most important physical principles of diffusion measurement are presented.	0.7695411137641359
After a short introduction into the basic physical principles, we will present the prerequisites and limitations of clinically relevant applications today.	0.7081343932899412
Finally a few select examples of clinical use of these techniques in the acute diagnosis of stroke will be presented.	0.7623978661882034
The effects of chronical strains on physical or psychological health are subject of this paper.	0.4840062982336445
Stress-related symptoms of family caregivers of dementia patients have been proven in various studies.	0.6035335651830254
For this group of people an analysis of the health risc factors is regarded as to be especially important.	0.7005224046569519
Diary investigations allow to identify the individual assessment (by the caring person) of factors related to the care situation and to recognize the health and quality of sleep have been used as indicators regarding the state of health.	0.7968790899975802
In this study strong differences in the individual view of stress factors and their effects on psychological an physical state of the caring person are shown.	0.6685081430069507
The causes of residual deformity with posttraumatic painful arthritis after tarsometatarsal (Lisfranc) fracture-dislocation with the need for correctional arthrodesis are in our experience (22 cases over 5 years) overseen injuries in one third, closed reduction and immobilisation or inadequate fixation technique with K-wires in another two thirds of cases.	0.5880544772852658
Foot malalignment and residual instability is assessed with weight-bearing radiographs of both feet, adduction/abduction stress films and CT scans for complex deformity.	0.42638176064166106
Correction is carried out via two longitudinal dorsal incisions, strict epiperiosteal preparation and debridement of the Lisfranc joint of all remaining cartilage, sclerosis and fibrous tissue.	0.3834063535094098
Reorientation begins, in the same manner as primary open reduction, with anatomical alignment of the second metatarsal base to the second cuneiform.	0.8015886966542958
Defects are filled with autologous bone grafting, stable fusion can be achieved with 3.5 mm cancellous compression screws.	0.6999894609537801
Full weight bearing is allowed in a modelled plaster shoe for 6 to 8 weeks.	0.4142071172257835
The functional medium-term results are convincing with 15 of 17 patients seen after 13 months of follow-up working full time.	0.5710312259860373
The Maryland Foot Score improved from 38.9 to 76.8 points in these patients.	0.5710919136571517
The author of this paper deems it very necessary to rename Chinese Tuina, a traditional Chinese medical subject, so as to make Chinese Tuina conform to recent research results and formulation, as well as to combine Chinese Tuina with Western manual medicine at the clinic.	0.5679776194239812
This paper is the result of my research during the period of time was in Switzerland working together with Prof. Jiri Dvorak.	0.6179812675673115
The operability of a liver tumour depends on its three-dimensional relation to the intrahepatic vascular trees which define autonomously functioning liver (sub-)segments.	0.5477882694570945
The aim of our study was to establish a computer-based three-dimensional volumetric operation planning system for the liver.	0.7297742337245378
Methods: Using data from routine helical CT scans the three tissue subclasses of liver parenchyma, liver vessels and liver tumour were segmented semiautomatically.	0.5211624936769459
A dedicated segmenting tool was established using region growing algorithms in combination with an "intelligent" border finder.	0.4545060893727857
Visualisation is performed by the "Heidelberg Raytracer".	0.48354129849526784
The vascular trees are visualised as 3D graphs.	0.3308391716337728
Pseudoconnections between portal and hepatic venous trees are separated automatically.	0.2536043183168229
Security margins are calculated and the system presents a virtual resection proposal.	0.3459630940590826
Results: The 3D anatomy of the liver can be visualised in high quality resulting in good depth perception.	0.5913517937710461
Dependent liver parenchyma can be recognised automatically on the basis of the vascular trees.	0.6033530783170076
The system offers a individualised resection proposal including the tumour, security margin and dependent liver parenchyma.	0.3627132508854598
Conclusion: Three-dimensional presentation of the individual liver anatomy of a given patient facilitates the perception of the pathology.	0.7340590452316845
Virtual reality combined with artifical intelligence allows calculation of complete resection protocols, which can be quantified and modified interactively.	0.5030043398358187
This will make operation planning more objective; patient selection may be improved, and in cases of difficult tumour localisation different resection strategies may be tested.	0.6179040323076175
Thus virtual reality in liver surgery will improve teaching, surgical training and planning.	0.4660106535800405
It may lead to improved surgical care.	0.42037722400269584
Methods to predict the rate of spontaneous relapses in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic agents are missing.	0.5781213619321502
P-wave signal averaging might be helpful in this setting.	0.619068997876835
However, correct validation and standardization is strongly needed for p-wave analysis with the high resolution ECG.	0.6532751168488291
Signal averaging triggered to the p-wave is significantly superior to QRS-triggering.	0.4194493598061038
Bidirectional filtering or FIR-filtering is necessary.	0.16264159425534452
The data indicate significant differences in p-wave duration between patients with and without paroxysmal artrial fibrillation.	0.5565362057682135
Class I antiarrhythmic agents demonstrate a significant prolongation of p-wave duration, but did not influence spectral parameters.	0.6117555853518281
Treatment with sotalol reduces high frequency p-wave energy without altering p-wave duration.	0.47801334716667276
After optimizing the methods, p-wave analysis offers promise to separate patients prone to atrial fibrillation and normals.	0.6686960221776159
In addition, the evaluation of antiarrhythmic efficacy in patients with high risk of recurrent atrial fibrillation might be possible.	0.7279479870872726
In the majority of cases right atrial or ventricular thrombi represent pulmonary emboli in transit.	0.4555226398973917
These may be fatal in patients treated conservatively with anticoagulation only.	0.7358507957118775
In literature the incidence of right heart thrombi in patients with proven pulmonary embolism is said to be in the range of 3 - 4%.	0.7570752876244927
Extremely mobile, long, worm-shaped masses in the right heart cavities carry an especially high early thrombus-related mortality rate which ranges from 30 - 40%.	0.5907484959178053
Current therapeutic strategies favour fibrinolytic therapy with consecutive anticoagulation.	0.3786217549391992
In the last years, several studies addressed the role of the different antithrombotic therapeutics in unstable angina pectoris.	0.8626037881097534
Acetylsalicylic acid still is the standard treatment reducing the rate of death and myocardial infarction by 50% in the first six months.	0.8711957706145885
Ticlopidin has no clinical effect in the first six days and therefore is not suited for treatment in the acute phase.	0.8442297670749871
Unfractionated heparin has an additional favourable effect when added to aspirin.	0.30825455037070293
Low molecular weight-heparin is at least as effective as UF-heparin.	0.524241089718819
Direct thrombin-inhibitors (hirudin, hirudin-analoga) seem to be comparable to UF-heparin.	0.39065637226926364
Pasminogen-activators should not be given in unstable angina, as they show a tendency to worsen the clinical outcome.	0.7741805459592546
GP IIb/IIIa-antagonists (antibodies, synthetic antagonists) significantly improve the clinical effects of aspirin.	0.5179595480322637
When combined with a reduced dose of heparin, their favourable effect remains unchanged, while bleeding complications are reduced to a minimum.	0.7125591513309437
The study presents data on cardiovascular malformations in Bavarian livebirths, born between 1984 and 1991.	0.3904210190786246
Cases have been ascertained retrospectively by reviewing hospital records of all children being referred to a children's hospital up to 2 years of age.	0.5426953100232698
The classification scheme was based on abnormalities in developmental mechanisms.	0.3955320753240303
Severe dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa with oral involvement often leads to dental destruction and restricted food intake, resulting in malnutrition and maldevelopment.	0.33748145146119657
The patients become handicapped and have a poor prognosis.	0.38040843570187655
We report on a now 13-year-old Turkish child with normal secondary dentition who had severely damaged primary dentition.	0.481718067203611
The teeth were treated surgically and then by continuous dental hygiene measures over the next 7 years.	0.4915240992002179
This care also resulted in an improvement in the nutritional state, associated anemia and the incidence of skin infections.	0.6362818353120305
Although cutaneous blistering and scarring has been progressive, with resulting mutilation of the fingers, the child is socially well adjusted in school and family.	0.5908512449655954
Its clinical course demonstrates that the fate of patients with severe dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa can be improved through multidisciplinary management.	0.6265612867740511
Our understanding of ulcer pathogenesis has dramatically changed since the discovery of Heliobacter pylori.	0.3429493553716664
Peptic ulcer is now recognized as a chronic gastric infectious disease.	0.3548408729448181
H. pylori can be considered the pacemaker, with other known risk factors ultimately contributing to the ulcer formation.	0.7733263007939594
Treatment of H. pylori in peptic ulcer disease cures the acute lesion and prevents relapse and complications.	0.45195104081240123
In clinical management a positive diagnosis of H. pylori is required and other potential causes for ulcer formation must be excluded before starting treatment.	0.5540449409329165
The standard treatment in H. pylori positive ulcer consists of PPI in standard dose and two antibiotics either clarithromycin 2 x 500 mg and amoxycillin 2 x 1 g or metronidazole 2 x 400 mg and clarithromycin 2 x 250 mg (or 500 mg) for 7 days.	0.5530853008387052
The simultaneous presence of H. pylori and NSAID intake requires distinct management.	0.44613996281664875
Following bleeding complication a PPI needs to be given beyond 7 days until ulcer healing is endoscopically confirmed.	0.38752333896870617
We present the results of a study conducted in collaboration with the German workers' board to monitor the effectiveness of treatment in 477 cases.	0.8326573743291904
The examiners reviewed the charts of patients who had suffered distorsion or luxation of the knee, fractures of the spine with or without neural deficits, calcaneus fractures, rotator cuff lesions and shoulder luxation, and fractures of the acetabulum and pelvis as the result of accidents.	0.7553542163431669
A new documentation sheet was desiged to note administrative and medical data.	0.28620108902649716
All 477 patients' charts and X-rays were reviewed by three trauma surgeons, and procedures were monitored in a prospective manner.	0.6712322929395782
The study revealed considerable discrepancies between the assumed injuries and those ultimately found to have been sustained, especially in the case of knee injuries.	0.6291816634059737
The article reveals the results concerning the validity of the diagnosis and the need for more precisely tailored diagnostic methods for different patient groups.	0.671924304309141
Our final conclusion is that it is necessary to implement new paths of patient management and better steering features to improve both the quality of medical care and the administrative procedures in place.	0.5841712727581977
A workshop on attenuated cold-adapted influenza virus vaccines (CAIV) was organized in Langen, Germany on December 16-17, 1998 by Prof. Reinhard Kurth, President of the Paul Ehrlich Institute.	0.4620222172989636
Reperfusion injury has become a scientific problem of increasing importance, in part because of recent developments of thrombolytic therapy.	0.7027616351079119
The mechanisms of reperfusion injury following focal cerebral ischemia, however, are not known in detail.	0.6869440795063373
Recent studies strongly suggest that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium overload play an important role in reperfusion injury and that pharmacological interventions against calcium- or free radical-mediated damage could extend the therapeutic window in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.	0.553450939665205
The mediators involved are known to induce a mitochondrial permeability transition (PT) during the reperfusion period, which is associated with uncoupling of mitochondrial respiration, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and a burst production of ROS, leading to cellular death.	0.665689436846243
The mitochondrial PT is considered to be a key process in reperfusion injury following cerebral ischemia, as also observed in other organs such as heart and liver.	0.6812763210202833
Pharmacological modulation of mitochondrial permeability changes have the potential to reduce tissue damage due to reperfusion.	0.5010729769581627
We performed an open clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of a 1 µg/h ganciclovir implant for the treatment of newly and pretreated cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).	0.5340481229452435
The purpose of this study was to compare the initial stiffness of two techniques for posterior interbody lumbar fusion (PLIF) by a finite element approach.	0.5929254125508705
Thus a finite element model of a human L3/4 spinal segment was generated.	0.47168276850190555
Stiffness of the intact model was tested under compression (600 N), torsion (25 Nm) and shearing forces (250 N) without preload.	0.7107964227518955
The results were compared to the stiffness following simulation of PLIF with two BAK-Cages and PLIF with two Harms-Cages and additional posterior screw-rod-osteosynthesis.	0.4705658595561765
PLIF with two BAK-Cages resulted in a loss of stiffness in compression, torsion and shearing.	0.3721721284345454
PLIF with two Harms-Cages and posterior osteosynthesis resulted in an increase of stiffness in compression, torsion and shearing.	0.47574542373808404
Tramadol, an analgesic with mean potency one tenth that of morphine is used regularely for the treatment of chronic and postoperative pain.	0.6549275570935633
Previous reports have indicated that tramadol may induce seizure activity when given together with a selective serotonine reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).	0.40942283018527137
Therefore, its major mode of action may be questioned which purportedly is due to binding with the opioid receptor and partly due to the inhibition of monoamine reuptake.	0.5666433529924376
Aim: The cause of a connatal hemiplegia was retrospectivly investigated in children born at term.	0.5135287883749908
The article gives a short review on the history of the field.	0.7010725788747056
First forensic cases were solved by the use  of medicocriminal entomology in the thirteenth century but the method has only developed to a professional level over the last 100 years.	0.5180634291924454
In Europe, mainly French, Belgian, English and Scandinavian researchers have been responsible for maintaining the methods.	0.41650407312466087
In France, an entomological police laboratory has been set up in Rosny-sous-bois.	0.4319889036850211
In contrast to the United States of America where entomological evidence is accepted by the courts, the method has only just started to be accepted in Germany.	0.6189475827200996
Initially cooperation with the police and with judges might help to establish the analysis of arthropods as a routine tool in forensic science for Germany.	0.532434817913746
27 patients with sternocostoclavicular hyperostosis (SCC) and/or pustulotic arthroosteitis (PAO) were examined with whole body scintigraphy, conventional radiography, and other imaging modalities, such as CT, MRI.	0.7348707382830622
25 of 27 patients with SCCH showed a characteristic high bullhorn-like uptake of the sternocostoclavicular region with the manubrium sterni representing the skull and the inflamed sternocostoclavicular joints corresponding to the horns (=bullhorn-sign).	0.4352028644839968
Scintigraphy revealed additional skeletal manifestations (spondylitis, sacroiliitis, osteitis, periostitis) in 19 of the 27 patients with SCCH and/or PAO.	0.5024715325380349
In combination with PPP or psoriasis pustulosa, the typical scintigraphic bullhorn pattern enables the diagnosis of PAO (19 patients) with high confidence.	0.7454954103317607
Patients with SCCH but without skin disease at the time of presentation (8 of 27 patients) may develop PPP later and, therefore, it is justified to classify them as incomplete PAO with high risk to develop other skeletal manifestations later in the course of the disease.	0.6893470371279621
PADAM stands for partial androgen deficiency in the aging male, and it is currently diagnosed with a testosterone level below 3 ng/ml (300 ng/dl or 12 nmol/l), and with symptoms varying according to the individual.	0.6785353046513519
The symptoms are a reduction or even loss of libido, a decline in muscle mass and strength, enhancement of visceral fatty tissue-padding, dryness of the skin, apathy, tiredness and distortion of mood right up to depression, and ostalgia due to osteoporosis.	0.5416709628111191
A 34 year-old pregnant woman presented with reticulate pigmentation of the flexures, the dorsum of the hands and the genitoperianal region.	0.5547509710716624
She was in good health and her family history was unremarkable.	0.4014727683135362
Histologic examination of the hyperpigmented patches revealed pigmented filiform downgrowths of the interfollicular epidermis and follicular infundibula, as well as small epithelial cysts.	0.4234749651345101
Upon immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies, the number of melanocytes appeared normal.	0.5336767700432132
The elongated dendritic processes of the melanocytes contained many mature melanosomes.	0.29480699033734276
In the adjacent keratinocytes large melanosomes did not aggregate into complexes.	0.3468604813659086
The diagnosis of localized reticulate pigmentary disorder was established.	0.45470173115005874
The knowledge of the broad clinical spectrum of localized reticulate hyperpigmentations with its favorable prognosis is of practical importance.	0.48084252323697624
Genital or flexural pigmented lesions have to be differentiated from melanosis of the vulva or acanthosis nigricans.	0.4242907311685094
The presented case gives further evidence that many of the proposed entities characterized clinically by reticulate pigmented macules and hyperkeratotic follicular lesions are different phenotypic expressions of the same autosomal dominant genodermatosis.	0.4763138978409114
Purpose: During the last few years there has been an increasing interest in evaluating quality of life (QOL) data regarding surgical treatment.	0.6701289605739096
Methods: The present study comments the efficacy of laparoscopic antireflux surgery after required Nissen fundoplication of 70 patients.	0.5979551930319202
Therefore, the German Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) was used to query the patients preoperatively and three times after surgery up to 1 year.	0.760347694967202
Results: Preoperatively, we found a low general GIQLI score (mean 92.7 points), which increased 6 weeks postoperatively (116.8 points), 3 months (124.8) and 1 year (mean 123.9 points) significantly and is now comparable to the healthy population (122.6 points).	0.840981626679193
Conclusion: It is our opinion that the efficacy of the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease with required Nissen fundoplication can also be documented and discussed by using QOL.	0.7491124362559491
Introduction: Serous cystadenomas of the pancreas are rare tumors and thought to be almost always benign.	0.6060875180491739
Methods: We report our experience in the diagnosis and surgical treatment of 12 patients with these tumors.	1.058676192457606
Results: Between October 1993 and December 1998, 41 patients with cystic tumors of the pancreas underwent surgical resection; in 12 cases (11 women, 1 man) a serous cystadenoma (10 micrcocystic, 2 oligomacrocystic) was found.	0.861158350166675
Only 6 (50 %) patients had symptoms.	0.849372984609189
The mean tumor size was 4.8 (2.7-10) cm.	0.9685603087175311
Ultrasound, CT and MRT usually could detect the mass, but differentiation with other cystic lesions was not reliable.	0.6528121242712747
All tumors were resected: 4 Whipple procedures, 7 distal pancreatectomies and 1 segmental resection were performed.	0.48850784589771123
No patient died after surgery and none had to be reoperated on.	0.5306131843879386
Conclusions: Because of the difficulty in reliably differentiating benign and malignant lesions of the pancreas, we believe that cystic tumors of the pancreas should be resected.	0.7454881207356848
We examined the prevalence of HIV-associated cutaneous disorders as well as the frequency and efficiency of UV-radiation in HIV-infected patients by evaluating the clinical records of 1310 patients seen between and 1994 and 1996.	0.7123430772755945
41 patients were treated with UVB-radiation and 4 patients with UVA1-radiation, while three patients received PUVA-therapy.	0.6524286480790628
UV-radiation proved to be efficient and safe in the treatment of pruritic papular eruption, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.	0.5270074481977044
Although some in vitro studies and studies with transgenic mice have suggested a negative impact of UV radiation on the immunosystem of HIV-positive patients, no progression of the HIV infection due to phototherapy has been proven.	0.6370792628354297
The staff at interventional radiological procedures is exposed to high levels of ionizing radiation.	0.4373399557754509
This applies especially to measures at cardiac catheterization laboratories.	0.2860742847407458
In this study the annual radiation exposure to the staff was estimated by measuring the dose rate under characteristic conditions.	0.6474046809302275
It could be shown that the resulting radiation exposure was strongly dependent on the radiation protection measures and is also dependent on the operation conditions of the x-ray tube.	0.6947466756077382
The effective dose for the physician wearing a lead apron and thyroid shield was detremined to about 1.7 mSva.	0.5467902976272093
Without a thyroid shield an effective dose of about 3.5 mSva resulted.	0.5522192615532063
This corresponds to approximately the natural background radiation of about 2.4 mSva in the Federal Republic of Germany.	0.5054344500448607
From the number of procedures performed we could derive an effective dose of approximately 1-2 µSv per application for the physician, averaged over all types of procedures.	0.5718005077850326
Further, it could be shown that the readings of the film badges, usually worn by the staff, underestimate the effective dose by approximately a factor of two.	0.6491972824388581
This is because the film badges do not include the contribution of the unshielded parts of the body to effective dose.	0.6000649060754226
From the estimated annual effective dose, a lifetime dose of 68 mSv was estimated for a 40-year working career.	0.5009989746013035
The corresponding lifetime risk for induced fatal cancer due to radiation exposure was determined to 0.3% applying the ICRP risk factor of 4  -  10-2 Sv-1.	0.6455614327116097
Considering the NCRP recommendations for a safe occupation, working in a cardiac catheterization laboratory can be considered as safe when applying all radiation protection measures.	0.5863702917276157
However, changing the protection measures and modifying the parameters of the x-ray-tube can lead to strong changes of the radiation exposure and the resulting risk estimation.	0.6873036988538317
Treatment of pulmonary hypertension is an important issue in intensive care.	0.6902364138750317
One therapeutic regimen involves the intravenous administration of prostacyclin (PGI2).	0.3034574906538623
This, however, is accompanied by diminished hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, reduced arterial oxygenation, and systemic vasodilation.	0.6794786772732505
Thus, its clinical usefulness is limited.	0.5868333544073427
However, the inhalation of vasodilators such as nitric oxide (NO) or nebulized PGI2 causes a selective pulmonary vasodilation in ventilated alveoli and improved gas exchange, without any systemic vasodilation.	0.5658256567327432
It has therefore gained importance for the treatment of pulmonary failure associated with high shunt fractions.	0.6479892971280934
However, the inhalation of vasodilators may have adverse effects: in the case of NO, toxic side effects are predominant (MetHb, NOx), whereas in the case of PGI2, technical problems in terms of dosing and administration safety are of major interest.	0.6688643582659726
Furthermore, some patients do not respond to the treatment.	0.7224924385630378
In some individuals a reduction in pulmonary hypertension can be seen, while others lack even pulmonary vasodilation.	0.6182578279778126
The exact pathophysiological mechanisms remain to be investigated.	0.3446912370199768
The treatment of infrarenal aortic aneurysms by means of transluminally placed endovascular prostheses reflects significant progress in the field of vascular surgery.	0.4652549419791097
In the case of infrarenal aortic aneurysm it is possible to achieve technically successful implantation of such a prosthesis in well over 90 % of cases.	0.6712111664061912
The rate of clinical success, meaning lasting effective exclusion of the aortic aneurysm, cannot (yet) be definitively determined, since no long-term results are so far available.	0.6783730798897387
Secondary leaks are observed in at least 10 % of all patients, making a further therapy necessary (endorepair, conversion, embolization).	0.6872788306578953
Further development of endovascular prostheses will include optimization of the aortal/iliac attachment of the prostheses, a better configuration and the development of long-lasting materials that can be used for endovascular prostheses.	0.7281055373181784
The frequency of postspinal headaches after accidental puncture of the subarachnoid space with 16 - 18 G Tuohy needles is reported at 59 - 85%.	0.5618596009335571
A case of postspinal headache syndrome persisting over a period of 6 weeks following epidural anaesthesia during labour is described.	0.4756712835217036
A 30-year-old women had severe postspinal headache for 6 weeks after epidural anaesthesia during labour.	0.5923613560023706
Conservative therapy for 3 days and 4 days of bedrest followed by cristalloid infusions during a 3-week hospital stay and a subsequent 3-week period of bedrest at home did not lead to lasting pain relief.	0.5685048952317949
Intracranial haematoma and other abnormal processes were excluded by CCT.	0.3063623702925131
A pathologic EEG was not confirmed by cranial MRT.	0.29325693297747907
A lumbar epidural blood patch of 15 ml of autologous blood was performed at L3/4.	0.589716483715754
The patient stayed in bed for 12 h. After 3 h free of pain the patient complained of recurring headache.	0.6418651232836706
After a further 48 h of bedrest she had recovered.	0.3912140446493881
Because of lumbar pain 4 days after the epidural blood patch a MRT was performed, which showed the blood at L4 to S3 in the epidural space.	0.6103165027964895
The diagnosis of a cerebrospinal fluid leakage was based on the history and the main symptom of postspinal headache: the pain onset in the supine position.	0.8100560712946736
Such possible treatments as diminishing subarachnoidal pressure by bedrest, increasing cerebrospinal fluid production by infusions, increasing epidural pressure by epidural infusions and closing the cerebrospinal fluid leakage by epidural blood patch are discussed.	0.43762513305421574
The average success rate with the epidural blood patch is 93%.	0.4222544274963989
Volumes ranging from 5 to 20 ml are discussed for the autologous blood.	0.4335102153909469
We chose 15 ml of blood, to take account of the possibility that blood might settle in the wide sacral space.	0.6093706242624702
We were able to document the position of the blood patch as L4 to S3 on MR tomography (the injection site was L3/4).	0.6564284009839206
Most patients are free of headache 1 h after epidural blood patch.	0.492502850420727
Our patient had to be confined to bed for another 48 h because of recurring headache.	0.4546710896195116
The blood patch alone was not immediately sufficient to prevent all further cerebrospinal fluid leakage.	0.4892863703299608
Probably more than one subarachnoidal puncture had been made during the difficult epidural anesthetic procedure.	0.5063989478478628
On the other hand, the leak was probably only diminished because of the blood patch descending down to the wide sacral space.	0.6015895379315672
The combination of the large-volume blood patch, which diminished the leakage, and conservative treatment, which narrowed the transdural pressure difference, was successful: the 6-week postspinal headache was cured.	0.7705008485791307
Prolonged postspinal headache should be treated by epidural blood patch.	0.5170192457055106
The use of over 10 ml cannot be generally recommended, although in this case most of the blood patch of 15 ml was localized caudally.	0.7476170307493791
Careful monitoring for side effects is necessary with blood volumes larger than 10 ml.	0.41908712125516273
If there is no immediate relief, conservative therapy with 24 - 48 h of bedrest is recommended.	0.6754255068356606
If the headache persists a second blood patch should be performed, with the volume and the probable caudal spreading of the first taken into account.	0.7634101073342208
The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of carvedilol therapy in addition to conventional heart failure therapy on heart rate variability (HRV) and on left ventricular function in 14 patients with mild to moderate heart failure due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC).	0.6791817289667312
After a 3- to 4-week titration period, carvedilol was titrated up to 50mg daily, or the highest dose tolerated (at least 25mg daily).	0.7299807348277891
Maintenance treatment was then continued for 8 weeks.	0.42368940445845477
Digital 24-hour Holter recordings were obtained at baseline and after 8 weeks of carvedilol therapy.	0.5647713900460435
HRV for the entire 24-hour period was computed in the time domain using the Oxford Medilog Excel 2 analysis system.	0.5070321021200666
Measures of HRV included the mean of all coupling intervals between normal beats (RRm), the standard deviation of all normal RR intervals (SDNN), the square root of the mean of the squared differences between adjacent normal RR intervals (rMSSD), and the proportion of adjacent normal RR intervals differing >50ms (pNN50).	0.5799836027707354
The histologic determination of the degree of tissue anaplasia and grade of malignancy of gliomas is based upon qualitative histological features (nuclear pleomorphism, mitoses, endothelial proliferation, tumor necrosis).	0.5697563885304137
This grading approach is influenced by the subjective interpretation of the pathologist, especially concerning the weighting of criteria (scant, moderate, pronounced).	0.5886176748690233
An observer-independent approach seems to be feasible by abandoning the concept of parameter weighting in favor of an binary approach noting only the presence or absence of these structure parameters.	0.4104170610328839
This grading procedure is recognized in the revised WHO classification of brain tumors for common type astrocytomas (Ste.	0.46956013481397807
Anne-Mayo System, SAMS).	0.2429608740512303
Our results indicate that a similiar approach is also suitable for grading purposes of oligodendrogliomas and mixed gliomas.	0.39966310288886575
Our recent investigations on glioma grading showed, both for astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, that a two-tiered grading scheme distinguishing only "low-grade" and "high-grade" cases was prognostically relevant.	0.720901095058737
For all glioma entities the onset of tumor angiogenesis with endothelial proliferation and contrast enhancement in CT and MRI seems to be the key criterion indicating irreversible tumor progression to the "high" malignancy grade.	0.6179288554495808
In patients with severe angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease, who are not candidates for either percutaneous coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery, transmyocardial laser revascularization (TMR) often leads to improvement of clinical symptoms and increased exercise capacity.	0.6883849677685699
One drawback of TMR is the need for surgical thoracotomy in order to gain access to the epicardial survace of the heart.	0.5222836036496449
Therefore, a catheter-based system has been developed, which allows creation of laser channels into the myocardium from the left ventricular cavity.	0.8437684816419271
Several phase III studies have proven that the beta-interferons have positive effects on the number and severity of acute exacerbations of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.	0.5360124481670757
Recently the first study on the effectiveness of interferon beta-1b in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis was published.	0.5829854028268739
In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study 718 patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and an expanded disability status scale (EDSS) value between 3.0 and 6.5 were treated with either 8 Mio.	0.6141872749078995
interferon beta-1b or placebo subcutaneously every second day for two to three years.	0.4192175615771596
The primary study end-point was the time until confirmed progression of the disease as signified by a one point increase of the EDSS value (for initial EDSS values between 3.0 and 5.5) or 0.5 point increase when the initial EDSS value was between 6.0 and 6.5.	0.8059890984751849
After two years an interim analysis showed a highly significant difference in delay of disease progression by nine to twelve months for the treatment group (p=0.0008).	0.6162003486221366
This means that interferon beta-1b is the first recombinant beta-interferon to be shown effective in the treatment of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.	0.5716160690236693

Cases of female patients who suppose having been sexually abused by their fathers during (early) childhood and wish to explore and work on healing this trauma are being discussed.	0.42204717816749693
As a result of projection and counter transference the therapist developes feelings of distrust, disbelief and of being involved in a "hysterical theatre performance" so that this sort of therapy is very difficult to conceive and carry out.	0.5594447238030591
In this contribution an attempt is being made to understand these patients and to examine their psychodynamic background as well as the deeper meaning of their above mentioned theatrical efforts.	0.5495553856791219
On the basis of these cases we can put the following psychodynamic hypotheses: 1) The incest-phantasy is a narcissistic attempt; 2) The incest-phantasy is a symbolic representation; 3) in the sense of a symbolic wish-fullfillment included in the parent-child-interaction.	0.608643308739405
After this, an attempt is being made to examine in various therapeutical scenes the role of these phantasis during the transference procedings and finally to develope diagnostic criteria with which these patients can be differentiated from others with definitely witnessed sexual abuse cases so that consequently treatment techniques can be devised in future.	0.49443155367534136
Hospitals and clinics for ambulant surgery shall identify and register certain officially defined nosocomial infections (Surveillance) as well as the isolation of bacteria with special and important antimicrobial resistancies (§ 23 Abs.	0.46724658357859966
1 IfSG = Infection Prevention Act).	0.18201512203872683
The nosocomial infections to be recorded, i. e device associated infections and postsurgical woundinfections, have been selected on the basis of national and international experiences with the surveillance of nosocomial infections.	0.5943132154344278
Important antimicrobial resistancies have been determined according to both the prevalence of the bacteria in nosocomial settings as well as their clinical and epidemiological importance.	0.6145879746259674
Most of the relevant data may be provided by the clinical microbiology laboratory but shall be collected, listed and discussed by the staff of wards or surgery clinics.	0.5616635891733128
Both types of documentation shall be used to identify and eradicate problems in hygiene management and to stop further distribution of difficult to treat bacteria like MRSA.They are part of the quality assurance management according to § 137 SGB V.	0.5675728782518025
Nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC) belong to the most frequent malignant tumours in certain parts of the world, e. g., south-east Asia, while they occur infrequently in western  Europe.	0.5745126160219816
The association of NPCs with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a transforming human herpes virus, is well established.	0.5806417907695358
The current WHO classification recognises two major NPC histotypes, non-keratinising NPC and squamous cell NPC.	0.3803838825867089
EBV is invariably present in non-keratinising NPCs and the viral oncoprotein LMP-1 (latent membrane protein-1) is expressed in some cases.	0.6143168724934694
The tumour cells of non-keratinising NPCs show phenotypic features which are inducible by LMP-1 in  vitro.	0.443109741275039
These may contribute to the development of the lymphoid stroma which is characteristic of this tumour type.	0.6267231304491594
Furthermore, the virus is detectable in nasopharyngeal carcinoma in situ.	0.4930877249422192
Thus, the virus is likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of  non-keratinising NPCs.	0.7705820764160392
By contrast, the association of squamous cell NPCs with EBV  displays a geographical variability.	0.5926690214946232
It appears, therefore, that squamous cell NPCs are a heterogenous group of tumours distinct from non-keratinising NPCs.	0.4993545625555546
To assess treatment outcome and prognostic factors following postoperative external radiotherapy in 77 patients with low-grade glioma.	0.5694591663011288
Between 1977 and 1996, 45 patients with astrocytoma, 14 with oligodendroglioma and 18 with mixed glioma received postoperative radiotherapy with a median total dose of 52 Gy (range, 45 to 61 Gy).	0.6232977536083072
Sixty-seven patients were treated immediately following surgery, 10 patients with tumor progression.	0.9549525417002369
The influence of various factors including histology, gender, age, seizures, duration of symptoms (<= 6 weeks vs > 6 weeks), CT pattern (enhancement vs no enhancement), type of surgery, total radiotherapy dose and timing of radiotherapy on relapse-free survival and overall survival was investigated.	0.6993792552354512
The median overall survival time was 81 month, the 5- and 10-year survival rates were 54% and 31%, respectively.	0.8922636578205132
The median time to progression was 56 months, while the 5- and 10-year progression-free survival rates were 45% and 24%.	0.888997515799604
Univariate analyses identified the total radiotherapy dose (p = 0.01), duration of symptoms (p = 0.05), the presence of seizures (p = 0.04), and the CT pattern following intravenous contrast (p = 0.005) as significant prognostic factors for overall survival.	0.656816968208029
Progression-free survival rates were influenced by the total dose (p = 0.04), the duration of symptoms (p = 0.01) and CT pattern (p = 0.006).	0.671996401011601
On multivariate analysis, only the CT pattern (enhancement vs no enhancement) remained as independent prognostic factors for both progression-free survival and overall survival.	0.590847628765638
A minimum total dose of 52 Gy is recommended for the postoperative radiotherapy in low-grade glioma.	0.7375725865092442
Tumors with CT enhancement seem to need further intensification of treatment.	0.28616258144423895
We report three patients with severe Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS).	0.596272035967808
On clinical examination, no sensory deficit was elicited.	0.5191869854894834
Electromyography (EMG) and motor nerve conduction velocity (NCV) studies were indicative of an axonal lesion.	0.45805559034172294
In two patients, we found total peripheral conduction block without volitional EMG activity.	0.6780747806928867
Sensory NCV and cortical median nerve evoked potentials remained normal.	0.2385812198316052
Sural nerve biopsy revealed unequivocal alterations of sensory nerve fibers, some in the form of primary demyelination.	0.489885568670254
Therefore, these cases must bei classified as combined motor-sensory syndromes despite the clinical and electrophysiological findings.	0.6443752851638829
Although total denervation of the extremity muscles occurred, causing tetraparalysis, this manifestation appears to be attributable to the secondary axonal variant.	0.6044527560861418
In contrast to positive reports in literature, immunomodulatory treatment proved ineffective in all three cases.	0.5242393390422954
Continuous spinal anaesthesia (CSA) is a further means of central nerve block for anaesthesia besides single-shot spinal (SSS), combined spinal/epidural, and epidural anaesthesia.	0.6026507611612282
Do hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected food handlers represent a risk for the consumer?	0.5093210028532256
Epidemiological data on HCV transmission  in our opinion do not provide a basis for excluding HCV positive individuals from working as food handlers in general.	0.5589457667900314
Such restrictions seem to be justified only if HCV infected employees might infect their colleagues while performing occupational activities that are associated with a high risk of contracting percutaneous injuries and overt bleeding.	0.5373834016256833
Recently, good functional and anatomical results have been reported in treating full thickness macular holes.	0.7149853241492704
Only a few studies describe a removal of a membrane at the vitreoretinal interface after having removal of the vitreous and its cortex.	0.5897272430045835
To demonstrate the beneficial effects of removing this membrane at the vitreoretinal interface we present our functional and anatomical results in this retrospective study.	0.5451272982126885
Dementia-screening in clinical routine requires short, sensitive and specific tools.	0.5214288207587485
A number of standardized instruments are available for this purpose.	0.6747238210665354
The present study analysed the relationship between size of three examplary dementia-screening tests and their diagnostic accuracy.	0.5440266640194968
A phlebological report requires that an exact diagnostic investigation of the peripheral vein system be carried out to assess both function and morphology.	0.5241854568551968
The most important, reproducible findings can be obtained using dynamic phlebodynamometry and ascending pressure phlebography, as a second expert can directly reconstruct the process by which assessments have been made.	0.7117248095274259
Additional quantification information can be obtained by measuring reflux using colour- coded duplex sonography.	0.4915475473208276
A thrombophilic condition should always be investigated in terms of haemotasis.	0.4209965716807223
In patients with severe post-thrombotic disease, a chronic compartment syndrome of the posterior spaces should be reckoned with, and in such patients magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography and, if possible, dynamic compartment manometry are additional suitable methods of examination.	0.8214043441636494
There is currently no generally valid schematization of the post-thrombotic syndrome on which to base an expert opinion.	0.4211920471166594
When evaluating patients, we largely follow our own new classification, which distinguishes four stages based on clinical tissue sclerosis.	0.6236479544490621
Since systemic treatment of neuropathic plantar ulcers in diabetics (DNPU) has so far been rather ineffective, recent reports of successful management of DNPU by short-term retrograde transvenous leg perfusions (RVP) by South American angiologists encouraged us to apply this treatment method in diabetics suffering from chronic DNPU.	0.538398212674485
Hence, in a prospective comparative clinical trial started in 1989 we have treated 45 male diabetics suffering from DNPU with the same daily doses of netilmycin, administered either in systemic venous infusions (SVI: n=21, three times/day) or in RVP (n=24, once/day).	0.6724137512107679
After 10 consecutive days of treatment, ulcers had closed in 8 of the 24 patients treated with RVP, as against 3 of the 21 treated with SVI.	0.6248404202000795
Diminution of the ulcer area by >30% including full debridement was achieved in 10/24 of the RVP cases (SVI: 4/21).	0.606031408976671
During 6 months of follow-up, amputation of toes or forefoot was necessary in only 1 patient in the RVP group, but in 4 in the SVI group.	0.7281613874295478
Partial restitution of osteolytic damage was observed in some cases after RVP.	0.5439388636943241
Our results show that regional netilmycin therapy given by the RVP procedure is clearly superior to equal netilmycin doses administered by SVI for the treatment of DNPU.	0.4021778942931715
RVP can be recommended in DNPU, particularly when the ulcers are complicated by infections.	0.6634484244711427
There is hardly any other discipline that illustrates the conflict between the freedom of science and research, that is to say, ultimately, what is medically possible, and human dignity and the protection of life or, in other words, what can be justified in ethical or legal terms, so clearly as reproduction medicine.	0.6490192818961837
The topics involved in this conflict cover a broad spectrum, ranging from in vitro fertilization with subsequent implantation of the embryo through the problems of multiple pregnancy and selective feticide, the many questions raised by assisted fertilization, and especially by anonymous sperm donation, and the controversial techniques of preimplantation diagnosis and cryopreservation, to the legal aspects of prenatal diagnosis, some of which have already been the subjects of cases decided in the supreme courts.	0.7052636682165602
In a good many of these sectors it is difficult to reconcile what doctors can do and what it is admissible for them to do, so that it is hardly surprising that there is often no general consensus.	0.5140063989616651
Against this backdrop objective discussion is all the more important, and the notes in this paper, which necessarily touch on only some of the matters at issue, are intended to stimulate such discussion.	0.6479728959833969
In MR-imaging, similar to computed tomography, diagnosis of metastatic lymph-node disease is based on lymph-node sizes, and thereby it is non-specific.	0.7482654194603172

No accumulation occures in lymph node metastases.	0.41840426575643114
Lymph-node metastases can be detected by all three injection techniques.	0.6669966177750525
It has been shown experimentally, that in particular small metastases can be detected in normal sized lymph nodes.	0.8159945268270654
However, MR-lymphography also has inherent methodologic problems, as there may occure an uneven distribution of the contrast medium between different lymph-node groups.	0.7372988285397735
The experimental results with endolymphatic, interstitial, and intravenous MR-lymphography as well as first clinical results with intravenous contrast medium injection are presented and discussed.	0.6488107118178688
The purpose of this study was to evaluate anatomical and functional results of vitreoretinal silicone oil surgery for complicated retinal detachments due to trauma and myopia in children and juveniles.	0.6025076709995473
In 1993, we adopted conventional thoracic and abdominal prosthetic grafting and tailored aortoplasty (TAP) of the thoraco-abdominal aortic segment III/IV in chronic-expanding type B aortic dissection (CEAD) to achieve 2 primary goals: 1. reduction of renal/visceral and spinal cord ischemic time; 2. safe and secure reperfusion of all critical aortic branches for prevention of major complications, i. e. paraplegia, kidney failure, and intestinal infarction.	0.666000791851974
Among 71 thoracoabdominal aortic reconstructions since 1993, 5 CEAD patients (median age 47.8 yr, mean CEAD- 6.5 cm, 4 with Marfan Syndrome) underwent TAP.	0.8373199313411859
Selection criteria are: 1.	0.3883446612099028
CEAD- >5 cm 2. expansion rate >=5 mm/6 months 3. involvement of the critical aortic segment III/IV.	0.7054393963778105
TAP consists of: 1. left posterolateral aortotomy from Th 8 - L 2, 2. excision of the intraaortic dissection membrane(s) 3. aortic closure to a diameter of 3 cm to reduce wall tension.	0.7465393591970714
All 5 patients survived without any major complications, particularly no paraplegia.	0.5414390653567436
Mean cross-clamping was 43 min.	0.34645185091736885
After 7 months, 1 patient was successfully repaired due to false aneurysm at the distal thoracic graft suture line.	0.6142537286507458
After mean follow-up of 2.4 years, CT-angiography revealed a stable TAP segment (mean aortic- 3.2 cm) in 4 patients and one re-expanded TAP segment (from 4 cm after 24 months up to 7 cm) without signs of re-dissection.	0.8715256996901164
Our 4-year-results (1) corroborate the Johns Hopkins data.	0.6090824808066092
Although one re-expanded TAP segment is disquieting, we found the short-term gains so rewarding to strongly advocate the tailored approach as a principle means of avoiding paraplegia in this extremely high risk group of patients.	0.5504135729129419
All optically active molecules have at least one asymmetric atom in common which is attached to four ligands, that can have different three dimensional positions.	0.5454178037292581
Therefore it can be concluded that the resulting isomers are chemically identical in all respects except for the direction with which they rotate plane-polarized light.	0.5060716527434164
When the isomer and its corresponding enantiomer are present in equal proportions, they are called racemic mixture, a mixture that does not rotate polarized light, since the optical activities of the two isomers cancel each other.	0.6225996757018817
Although the isomers are chemically identical other optically active molecules can interact with these isomers in a geometrically specific way termed stereoselectivity.	0.3570472693643932
The human body comprises a chiral environment due to optically active proteins; thus it is not surprising that enantiomeric drugs exhibit different pharmacological properties, when used as pure optical isomers.	0.5658301980128452
Till today most modern anaesthetics have been optical isomers, which are mainly used as racemic mixture (1:1 mixture).	0.739149045235531
For financial reasons pure isomers were only used for research purposes, but nowadays the wide clinical use of pure isomers is financially feasible due to new production techniques.	0.512437570828322
The terms eutomer and distomer were chosen to indicate the more or less potent form of the drug.	0.5531554883332627
The clinical use of pure isomers is only of advisable, if there are significant differences between eutomer and distomer in desired or side effects.	0.6343535690933955
Among the modern anaesthetics ketamine, isoflurane, bupivacaine and atracurium exhibit an asymmetric carbon.	0.3631115246281096
For most drugs the separation in pure isomers will reduce side effects.	0.3033963966361667
For volatile anaesthetics this question is still unanswered, since experimental and clinical results are inconsistent so far.	0.542657234425831
The high prevalence of aspirin intolerance in asthmatics and patients with nasal polyps as well as reports of familial clustering suggest a genetic disposition of this disease.	0.5313031605758237
Our study aimed at obtaining further evidence of hereditary factors in this disease.	0.450498559698675
We included 33 unselected patients from 28 families with aspirin intolerance and rhinosinusitis in this study.	0.39975685746965733
Controls were recruited from individuals treated in our ENT clinic for diseases other than aspirin intolerance (n=52).	0.43229206494552413
The application of a tryptophan-free amino acid mixture (tryptophan depletion test) induces a rapid and substantial lowering of both total and free plasma tryptophan.	0.548235834050118
Consequently, the brain serotonin content and also cerebral serotonin function are decreased.	0.5055604242705136
This method provides a paradigm to study the role of serotonin in the pathobiology of depressive disorders and their treatment modalities.	0.4695096396399385
Untreated depressed patients show few behavioral effects during tryptophan depletion.	0.2703138300895671
In depressed patients during an antidepressant or light-therapy-induced stable remission, a transient depressive relapse was induced by tryptophan depletion.	0.5285631564046851
Healthy subjects with a genetic risk for affective disorder show worsening of their condition induced by tryptophan depletion.	0.4675218261847148
These findings indicate the relevance of altered brain serotonin function in the pathophysiology of affective disorders and strengthen the importance of serotonin in the mechanism of action of antidepressants.	0.5604457476981053
Since recently published studies revealed some evidence that the serotonergic system is directly involved in the pathophysiology of various psychiatric syndromes besides depression, it seems to be reasonable to evaluate the validity of the tryptophan depletion test also in non-depressed patients.	0.634368439321538
Several common chronic pain syndromes come to the attention of the rheumatologist demanding for differentiation from fibromyalgia (FM), although they are often associated with it.	0.5315090691970459
They may mimick FM by (1) the occurance of wide spread pain, (2) the chronicity of complaints, (3) the preponderance of females in some of these, and (4) the lack of objective data to be derived from imaging techniques and laboratory tests.	0.7451164249888785
Pain is produced by the disturbance of normal function ("dysfunctional syndromes", MASI, ref.	0.5850589349840482
Recognition requires examination of the locomotor system under biomechanical auspices both at rest and during movement in order to diagnose hyper- and hypomobility syndromes; treatment of these conditions is guided by principles to improve biomechanical function.	0.6398096222329004
In addition, the skin needs to be examined to detect panniculosis (also called "cellulitis"), which may be mixed up with FM due to its preferential occurance in peri- or postmenopausal women.	0.7108191494728089
It is concluded that the aforementioned differential diagnosis needs to be considered appropriately in coinciding FM and all studies dealing with FM.	0.5167414138909693
In a prospective, randomized study of patients with acute manifestation of coronary heart disease and hypercholesterolemia (LDL cholesterol >=130<=250mg/dl), we compared the effect of an early-initiated, intensified therapy to usual care antilipidemic therapy with respect to coronary lesions and clinical events.	0.7331789037580061
Patients were included immediately following acute myocardial infarction and/or PTCA because of severe/instable angina pectoris.	0.591583143453738
The intensified therapy consisted of pravastatin 20-40mg with addition of colestyramine and/or nicotinic acid, if necessary, to achieve an LDL cholesterol <=130mg/dl.	0.5531347596228001
In the control group, antilipidemic therapy was left up to the private physician.	0.5062342504687234

Abrupt vessel closure of the dilated vessel continues to represent a significant limitation of coronary angioplasty.	0.5033791176445692
Despite increasing operator experience and improved technology, abrupt vessel closure continues to represent the most important complication of balloon angioplasty.	0.522655775882357
Intracoronary stent implantation and pharmaceutical blockade of the GP IIb/IIIa receptor serve as effective tools in the prevention of abrupt vessel closure without completely resolving this problem.	0.43960647790699525
About 50% of patients presenting with abrupt vessel closure exhibit additional complications including myocardial infarction, necessity of CABG or death occurring in up to 10% of acute occlusions.	0.6705176122477305
The purpose of this study is to evaluate if quantitative coronary angiography and assessment of clinical and laboratory data allows risk stratification concerning the probability of abrupt vessel closure.	0.7799012950571209
PTCA in the setting of acute coronary syndrome is associated with a markedly increased risk of abrupt vessel closure, indicating that different risk factors may contribute to the development of abrupt vessel closure in patients presenting with stable angina or acute coronary insufficiency syndromes.	0.6432546974161057
Since the skin dose becomes the limiting factor while deciding the tumorcidal dose, the detailed analysis of dose distribution in the build-up region is necessary for high-energy photon beams.	0.5904771405189718
In this study the beam characteriwstics affecting the build-up and skin dose for 6- and 18-MV photons are analyzed.	0.7497282923674403
Measurements were made with 6- and 18-MV photons using a PTW parallel-plate ionization chamber (B23344-036) and a RDM-1F electrometer.	0.6377175091849362
Build-up ionization measurements were made with the chamber fitted into a 25 x 25 x 25 cm polystyrene phantom with a fixed SSD of 100 cm.	0.439324157797886
The entrance and buildup dose measurements were made with a polycarbonate and a mesh type metallic shielding tray and a 45 ° wedge.	0.38614292973944675
Exit dose measurements were carried out for the graphite patient supporting assembly table top, 1.0 cm thick piece of wood and the 1.0 cm thick patient supporting perspex base frame for head and neck treatments.	0.5819857200930071
It was observed that the dmax decreased slightly with field size as with other accelerators.	0.43982232604320115
For both photon energies the surface dose was observed to increase with increase in field size.	0.5304352079642198
It was also noticed that the dose in the build-up region increases slightly when the polycarbonate secondary blocking tray is introduced with the increase in surface dose.	0.5587214876087905
The data show that the tray pertubation factor (TPF) at surface decreases steadily with tray-surface distance for both photon beams for all field sizes.	0.5203092965978324
It was noted that the TPF was more when the polycarbonate tray was introduced at shorter tray-surface distances for both energies.	0.41844058896693603
At tray-surface distances above 60 cm the TPF almost remained close to unity for 6-MV photons for all field sizes, whereas the continuous decrease in TPF could be noted for 18-MV photon beams even after the TPF rewached unity.	0.5238782611818233
The increase in surface dose with field size for both photon energies is due to the electron scattering from the intervening materials.	0.5061496430415378
The use of wedge filters absorbs low-energy scattered electrons siginificantly and hence, the relative surface dose (RSD) is always less than unity.	0.5673504857900112
The increase in dose enhancement percentage with graphite compared to perspex supporting assembly indicates that the electron backscatter is proportional to the atomic number of the medium.	0.39375459029213095
We investigated the nutritional value of a very low fat diet (diet I) adapted to nutritional habits in Germany.	0.6492628346249208
Data were compared to a low fat diet (diet II) according to the American Heart Association.	0.6477235199778731
The study was performed in 37 patients with coronary heart disease (30 males and 7 females, age 45-83 yrs) stratified to the 2 dietary treatments.	0.7942489221751491
Daily fat intake was 38g (24% of energy intake of 6.5MJ/d) in diet I and 60g (31% of 7.3MJ/d) in diet II (p<0.01), respectively.	0.7228897499473009
When compared with dietII, in dietI the intake of cholesterol, saturated and monunsaturated fatty acids, Vit.	0.4668942123724427

C was increased p<0.01.	0.6117022143126039
The intake of folic acid was low in both groups.	0.36813726822752546
Both diets resulted in a decrease in BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, plasma cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels.	0.4794694854088581
Concomitantly plasma triglycerides only decreased in response to dietI but HDL cholesterol levels remained unchanged.	0.31296922641583297
Reduction of BMI and cholesterol levels were dependent on baseline BMI and cholesterol concentrations, respectively.	0.3929166971793161
The cholesterol lowering effect of diet I is in part attributed to the weight lowering effect of the diet.	0.5355801694010427
Taking into account the nutritional habits in Germany, very low fat diets seem to be adequate with respect to their nutritional value.	0.6056209793012777
Both diets are effective in lowering body weight, plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels without affecting HDL cholesterol.	0.36338875342812915
These effects are most pronounced in overweight and hypercholesterolemic patients.	0.3219389610166954
Besides autopsy determined findings of a fibro-fatty replacement in the right ventricular myocardium, no assured clinical evidence of arrhythmogenie right ventricular dysplasia-cardiomyopathy (ARVD) exists yet.	0.5985792274482982
Criteria for the clinical diagnosis of AVRD were complied in 1994 by members of the ISFC work group and the European Association for Cardiology.	0.6079671158324477
These criteria include structural, functional, histological, and electrophysiological abnormalities, which were divided into major and minor criteria.	0.7656490925482798
With the successive examination of a collective of 24 patients with a histologically determined diagnosis of ARVD at the Jean Rostand Hospital in Ivry-sur-Seien, France, the value of the complied criteria were checked.	0.5840599133722503
Global or segmental dilatation of the right ventricle in the sense of major criteria could be proven in 20 patients (83%) using angiography or electrocardiography.	0.734088604271471

A late potential analysis using signal averaged ECG was only present in 8 patients with positive results in 4 cases (50%) in the sense of minor criteria.	0.746985941064039
Left bundle branch block ventricular tachycardia, which was classified as a minor criterion, was observed in 23 patients (96%); only one patient died without proven arrhythmia from rapidly progressing heart failure.	0.7828825249410368
A previous history of unexpected sudden death in family members as a minor criterion arose in 3 of 19 patients (15%).	0.5458554546583892
The complied task force criteria for the diagnosis of AVRD led in all 24 cases to the diagnosis of the disease, whereby the value of a determined histological diagnosis was the gold standard.	0.6690751715900158
Without inclusion of histological data, the clinical diagnosis was determined in only 10 cases.	0.8510714785941371
The question remains whether with a simple division of findings into major and minor criteria a pure clinical diagnosis is possible.	0.4335149624010995

A 61-year-old woman with depression developed recurring elevated itching erythematous lesions in light-exposed areas after taking St. John's Wort-extract for three years.	0.40609648828773687
Routine patchtesting did not reveal any relevant reactions and photopatch testing was negative.	0.3578502222581433
Using a systemic oral photoprovocation test with St. John's Wort, we were able to demonstrate a decrease of the MED-UVB which was reversible after withdrawal of the medication.	0.5477967563109929
Due to its low solubility and the high maximum concentration delivered by the vaporizer sevoflurane is especially suitable for the performance of low flow anaesthetic techniques.	0.5869867423631603
High flow phases for wash-in or wash-out of anaesthetic gases can be kept short, the difference between the volatile's concentration in the fresh gas and within the breathing system is comparatively small, and the time constants are short even during low flow anaesthesia.	0.7059146417928279
The monitoring, required to sufficiently ensure the safety of the patients, corresponds to the current obliging technical safety standards.	0.5949407424137224
As compound A may accumulate in the breathing system, sevoflurane should not be administered with fresh gas flows lower than 1.0 l/min, until the scientific discussion on nephrotoxicity of this substance in humans is solved.	0.5959758929013119
Low flow anaesthesia guarantees a sufficient and continuous wash-out of trace gases.	0.4910580311733205
Thoroughly the use of sevoflurane with dry soda lime must be avoided, as this volatile in an extreme exothermic reaction is absorbed nearly totally and degraded to a considerable degree by dry carbon dioxide absorbent.	0.48503926624304977
The gaseous degradation products are pungent and possibly may be harmful to the patients.	0.47513905590347805
Only by low flow anaesthesia the use of sevoflurane will gain an economically and ecologically acceptable range of efficiency.	0.4444618894577978
Cardiogenic shock is the leading cause of death in patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction.	0.5840566049384593
The typical delay from the onset of acute infarction to the development of cardiogenic shock and well defined risk factors allow for an early identification of patients at risk.	0.5346282063171952
Immediate restoration of coronary artery patency by thrombolysis or PTCA can prevent cardiogenic shock in a number of these patients.	0.5170531015235352
Patients presenting with frank cardiogenic shock should be approached with diagnostic vigor in an attempt to identify a treatable lesion.	0.40347046876343756

Object of this review is to present the physiological principles, diagnostic techniques and therapeutic options that are related to modifications of oxygen delivery in sepsis.	0.7233002055865904
Despite intense research activities in this area, many topics regarding oxygen transport and oxygen consumption in sepsis are still not clear.	0.6303797416084455
For example, the often discussed shift of the critical value of oxygen delivery to higher values in sepsis has not been proven, yet.	0.6627452951663599
Beside an impaired regional perfusion also disturbances in the cellular oxygen utilization may be responsible for organ failure in sepsis.	0.5072130319291439
Until now, it was not shown, whether the increase of oxygen delivery to supranormal levels reduces mortality in septic patients.	0.7359995346658752
It is also unknown, which catecholamine and which infusion solution is suitable for the treatment of septic patients.	0.6826554695802263

Vomiting and regurgitation was provoked in each animal using six different manoeuvres while the gastro-oesophageal (lower oesophageal) sphincter and intragastric pressures were monitored and the lower oesophagus was continuously inspected using an endoscope.	0.4228254590059488
With local Ethics Committee approval and informed written consent, (1) repeated vomiting was provoked in 16 awake, healthy adult volunteers (10 females, 6 males, 29 +/- 4 years) with a fluid-filled stomach in the presence and in the absence of balloon occlusion of the cardia, while intragastric pressure was monitored, and (2) 30 patients (21 - 89 years) with an increased risk of pulmonary aspiration scheduled for abdominal or traumatologic surgery received conventional induction of anesthesia after blocking of the cardia with the balloon.	0.7794690375797664
Pigs (n=10) with a blocked cardia showed no gastrooesophageal reflux during a total of 60 manipulations to provoke vomiting and regurgitation, while 28 of the 36 provoking manipulations induced reflux in pigs (n=6) with an unblocked cardia.	0.6326041799194487
Among the healthy volunteers with a blocked cardia (n=16), reflux of gastric contents was not observed during repeated attempts to stimulate vomiting.	0.5215831392767932
After termination of the occlusion of the cardia, reflux was able to be induced by 14 of the 16 volunteers.	0.6131094307758435
In 30 patients with an increased risk of pulmonary aspiration the cardia was blocked and anaesthesia was induced using a mask and manual ventilation without encountering any problems.	0.5949832287086495
The average time from loss of consciousness to tracheal intubation was 164 +/- 8 s. Conclusions.	0.6154868971596303
It is concluded from the present results, with further clinical studies pending, that the gastric balloon probe permits low-risk conventional induction sequence of anaesthesia in patients with an increased risk for pulmonary aspiration and that the device may also be safely used during the extubation phase.	0.8040378717799025
The article explains the cognitive psychoanalytic theory of psychotherapy developed by Weiss and discusses the theory in the field between psychoanalytic and cognitive-behavioristic theories and therapeutic techniques.	0.4882883663934097
The basic assumption is: pathogenic beliefs that are based on traumatic childhood experiences prevent normal desirable goals.	0.3863099587502753
Patients are unconsciously motivated to overcome pathogenic beliefs.	0.234673766877911
In psychotherapy, the patient works to disprove pathogenic beliefs by testing them in the relationship with the therapist.	0.6653434852859518
In this way patients achieve corrective emotional experiences.	0.5103537100320417
The theory is supported by numerous empirical studies.	0.3467897986827194
Treatment with "nootropic drugs" of patients suffering from dementia is often described as arbitrary.	0.6525884931035715
To define the potential usefulness of nootropic drugs, effects and side effects, economic aspects in comparison to other treatment approaches were studied.	0.579079623197413
A summary of literature published concerning these criteria underlines the efficacy of nootropics in improving the symptoms at the beginning and in postponing the progress of the disease.	0.5193286659408698
The majority of substances does not lead to severe side effects.	0.4548411347134283
There are not enough studies comparing the effects of the substances or on prophylactic effects.	0.6099776556117915
Delayed admission to care units leads to a positi- ve cost effect of nootropics.	0.3992339542947132
Thus, also for economic reasons it seems advisable to treat patients with nootropics.	0.5899150191569585
Better effects are gained when nootropic treatment is combined with training and changing of the structure of the environment.	0.5034780162629294
A proposal for a rational treatment with nootropics is derived from the data.	0.4285707431959951

We evaluated changes in brain tissue oxygen pressure (ptiO2) and global cerebral blood flow (CBF) during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) in ten anesthetized New Zealand White rabbits (body weight 2.5 +/- 0.5 kg).	0.6323940958125548
CBF [hydrogen desaturation (clearance)-technique) and ptiO2 (Licox-microsensor) right frontoparietal cortex] were determined.	0.5575617702831256
After median sternotomy, the animals were placed on CPB (standard roller pump, nonpulsatile, -stat acid-base management, perfusion flow of 180-200 mL/kg/min, right atrial and aortic cannulation) for induction of DHCA by cooling to 15 °C rectal temperature (1 °C per minute).	0.631286395727504
Rewarming period was started after 60 minutes of circulatory arrest and the rabbits were weaned from CPB without the use of any inotropic or vasoactive support.	0.43667303637549615
Under baseline conditions, ptiO2 was 38 +/- 5 mmHg and did not change significantly before DHCA.	0.5026692824430644
During DHCA the ptiO2 decreased within 15 minutes to 14 +/- 5 mmHg, after 30 minutes to 5 +/- 1 mmHg and after 40 minutes to zero.	0.5860275410843857
Neither the ptiO2 nor CBF recovered fully following restoration of bypass flow and reperfusion: ptiO2 (25 +/- 4 mmHg vs. baseline: 38 +/- 5 mmHg, p<0.05) and CBF (43 +/- 8 vs. baseline: 68 +/- 11 ml/100 g/min, p<0.05) were significantly reduced.	0.6661625078104287
Arterial and jugular-venous lactate levels increased after rewarming (p<0.05) and corresponded to the appearance of a anaerobic metabolism.	0.5242105425869706
These data demonstrate significantly decreased levels of ptiO2 (brain tissue oxygenation) and CBF (oxygen supply) during and after rewarming from DHCA.	0.5723507259429401
The induced impairment of recovery persists after rewarming and generates a temporary low-flow situation with delayed brain tissue reoxygenation on the cellular/mitochondrial level.	0.46043965908992657
Thus, a direct influence on brain functional recovery by the active cooling and rewarming process about the bloodstream during CPB, resulting in disturbed tissue blood redistribution, mitochondrial dysfunction and/or excessive cerebral oxygen consumption (compensation of an oxygen debt) is a possible explanation.	0.5904160410180921
While initially advocated primarily for intrasurgical visualization (e. g., craniotomy), interventional MRI rapidly evolved into roles in image-guided localization for needle-based procedures, minimally invasive neurosurgical procedures, and thermal ablation of cancer.	0.44857824551772235
In this contest, MRI pulse sequences and scanning methods serve one of four primary roles: (1) speed improvement, (2) device localization, (3) anatomy/lesion differentiation and (4) temperature sensitivity.	0.6153273401648571

Although most of them are very rare, knowledge about their reproducible clinicopathological features is important to avoid diagnostic pitfalls.	0.6987976745587037
These lesions include: bacillary angiomatosis, a vasoproliferative, pseudoneoplastic infection of immunocompromised patients caused by Rochalimaea henselae; tufted angioma, a variant of lobular capillary haemangioma characterised by a "cannon-ball" distribution of multiple lobules composed of packed capillaries and pericytes; microvenular haemangioma, a cutaneous haemangioma composed of thin-walled and irregularly branching blood vessels which dissect dermal collagen; sinusoidal haemangioma, a distinctive variant of cavernous haemangioma which may be located in the subcutaneous breast tissue and then may be confused with well-differentiated angiosarcoma; "hobnail haemangioma" (targetoid haemosiderotic haemangioma), a benign vascular tumour with a distinctive clinical targetoid appearance and a hobnail cytomorphology of the prominent endothelial tumour cells; retiform haemangioendothelioma, a very recently characterised low-grade angiosarcoma occurring most commonly in the extremities of adolescents which is characterised by arborising blood vessels arranged in a retiform pattern and lined by hobnail-like prominent endothelial cells; Kaposi-like infantile haemangioendothelioma, a borderline malignant tumour of infants mimicking Kaposi's sarcoma histologically; epithelioid angiosarcoma, a highly aggressive tumour in the spectrum of epithelioid vascular lesions which stains positively for endothelial and epithelial immunohistological markers; benign lymph-angioendothelioma (progressive lymphangioma), a benign, slowly growing macule or plaque which has to be distinguished from well-differentiated angiosarcoma and Kaposi's sarcoma; and lymphangiomatosis of the limbs, a poorly recognised angiomatosis occurring in young patients and limited mainly to the limbs with a favourable prognosis.	0.5342007184904412

Experimental animal models of ventricular arrhythmias have been developed to investigate the mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis in man.	0.7752213223371665
Ventricular arrhythmias associated with ischaemia and infarction often cannot be elucidated by clinical studies on patients because those arrhythmias are potentially lifethreatening and their occurrence is unpredictable.	0.48504540378301847
Because of additional experimental procedures and techniques that can be used in the animal laboratory, such as microelectrode recording of transmembrane action potentials and high-density optical and electrical activation mapping, animal models have provided information that cannot be obtained from clinical studies.	0.6490532681748314
Studies on animal models have provided new ideas and hypotheses that have been tested in clinical studies and that have been found to be true for clinical arrhythmias.	0.7260913088147535
Animal models have enabled the mechanisms of fibrillation and defibrillation to be understood and new therapeutic concepts to be developed.	0.5862091514096778
The purpose of this article is to briefly review some animal models of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation.	0.6230252554334809
Some contributions that these animal studies have made to our understanding of ventricular tachyarrhythmias will be discussed.	0.5024383981518984
Because of the clinical importance of coronary artery disease this article concentrates on those arrhythmias caused by myocardial ischaemia and infarction.	0.7106540392407145
The authors report a rare, recently diagnosed and atypical mishap during one-lung ventilation (OLV) via a double lumen tube (DLT) and left-sided thoracotomy: an ipsilateral pneumothorax during ventilation of the right lung.	0.663314247252965
This occurred in a 63-year-old patient with chronic obstructive airway disease who was scheduled for urgent repair of a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm.	0.5938574478653137
Anaesthesia and surgery were uneventful until aortic cross-clamping release.	0.4468849907126873
The common presentation of increased intrathoracic extrapleural pressure owing to a pneumothorax in patients with mechanically ventilated lungs is a rapid decrease in oxygen saturation, followed or paralleled by haemodynamic deterioration.	0.5117123240315986
Although the above presentation could be seen in this case, the diagnosis of a tension pneumothorax was delayed twice.	0.8132422548061303
First, symptoms were initially obscured by haemodynamic changes resulting from a head-down tilt and aortic declamping.	0.49882653090699014
Second, since the lack of consolidation after aortic declamping focused attention on the airway problems, complications resulting from the use of a DLT were primarily considered.	0.7021433951745992
In particular, since breathing sounds were detectable initially, malposition or torsion of the DLT had to be excluded by fibre-optic bronchoscopy, which involved a further delay.	0.5678270062855253
Finally, two observations led to the diagnosis of a right-sided tension pneumothorax: (1) bullae of the contralateral lung, detected during thoracotomy; (2) the finding that ventilation of both lungs and the left lung subsequently increased arterial (SaO2) and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) and the circulatory status, but ventilation of the right lung caused a deterioration.	0.7955280634787385
Chest radiography and insertion of a chest tube with drainage of air, thereafter, validated our hypothesis.	0.43729620164398353
The time course of oxygen desaturation during OLV and tension pneumothorax was as severe as expected; the time course of haemodynamic deterioration, however, appeared quicker and had more impact than expected.	0.5075449106270928
Assuming that mediastinal deviation was not hindered by contralateral intrathoracic pressure during thoracotomy, we believed that circulation should be depressed later or to a lesser extent in patients with an intraoperative pneumothorax.	0.577662845826223
Yet, during thoracotomy, decrease in cardiac filling and output during tension pneumothorax in OLV obviously results primarily from the immovability of the mediastinum owing to mediastinal fixation and is at least as decisive as the contralateral intrathoracic pressure in closed-chest patients.	0.5413115596981878
In summary, a tension pneumothorax during one-lung ventilation and thoracotomy is a rare, but disastrous complication during the use of a DLT, which has not, to our knowledge, been reported previously.	0.7795718893078518
We recommend that tension pneumothorax be added to the list of complications and problems during OLV by the use of a DLT, especially in patients with structural lung diseases.	0.6825622119132502

Introduction: The goal of this study was to compare contrast-enhanced T1-weighted Flash and Turbo-Flash sequences with conventional spin-echo sequences as a basis for planning high-precision radiotherapy.	0.587197349279673
Methods: A total of 25 consecutive patients with different intracranial tumors and a disrupted blood-brain barrier were studied.	0.6019625507551342
T1-weighted Flash, Turbo-Flash and conventional spin-echo images were evaluated after controlled 30-s infusion of 0.1 mmol/kg body weight of Gd-DTPA.	0.5462237120764177
The evaluation of the three sequences included the measurement of the signal- and contrast-to-noise ratios, the visual inspection of the tumors and artifacts, and the measurement of tumor size.	0.8461166085161487
Results: The signal- and contrast-to-noise ratios were significantly (P < 0.05-0.01) lower for Flash and Turbo-Flash than for conventional spin-echo sequences.	0.6266853450004751
However, visual inspection of the contrast-enhancing tumors revealed in 23 and 24 of 25 lesions on Flash and Tu-rbo-Flash images, respectively, good or very good tumor visibility when compared with conventional spin-echo images with a reduction of imaging time by a factor of 7-8.	0.6122073388202985
Flash and Turbo-Flash sequences were more prone to susceptibility artifacts, conventional spin-echo sequences more to pulsation artifacts in the posterior fossa.	0.4709221713187955
Tumor sizes were comparable in all three techniques.	0.5786027068105618
Conclusion: At present, conventional spin-echo images are superior to fast Flash and ultrafast Turbo-Flash sequences as a basis for accurate target volume definition in high-precision radiotherapy.	0.5208552585922763
However, fast Flash and Turbo-Flash images may be a practicable alternative to conventional spin-echo images for tumors in the posterior fossa or in patients unable to tolerate a stereotactic fixation device.	0.5881105892607631
Despite some limitations, Turbo-Flash sequences enable fast dynamic MR imaging combined with an acceptable morphology, which may be sufficient for target volume planning in high-precision radiotherapy.	0.6223764775263373

When protein intake is decreased or in situations in which there are a high demand of nucleotides synthesis (after gut injury, after surgical trauma, sepsis, rapid growth: pregnancy or newborn infants, etc.)	0.5499687591976121
some tissues with a rapid turnover (gut and immune system) may increase the salvage of exogenous nucleotides coming from the diet.	0.5063387963881587
Therefore, nucleotides may become conditionally essential nutrients.	0.3155592733295338

Parkinson's disease (PD) causes significant expense for the national health care system due to its chronic progressive course, the duration of the disease, the high prevalence and the devastating prognosis.	0.716896674247494
In Germany more than DM 320 million are spent for drugs to alleviate parkinsonian symptoms.	0.3026401086589872
The aim of this study was to calculate the economic burden of PD by assessing direct medical costs.	0.4702195193499394
Forty patients suffering from idiopathic PD were interviewed at an office of neurological specialists and at an outpatient movement disorder clinic about their use of health care resources 3 months prior to the study.	0.5379643900412905
The total annual costs reported were DM 14,500, consisting of DM 6500 for drug therapy and DM 8000 for other medical services, including hospital inpatient care (DM 5600), outpatient care (DM 700), medical sundries (DM 1100) and physiotherapy (DM 600).	0.5909763023916146
The costs were positively correlated to the extent of the disease (Hoehn and Yahr stage; HY) and the occurrence of motor fluctuations/dyskinesias.We found that both drug-therapy expenses and total medical costs doubled from HYI to HYIV.	0.5827049198094043
The rarely employed s.c. therapy with apomorphine additionally increased the costs of drug therapy in HYV.	0.5347289269222726
The occurrence of fluctuations/ dyskinesias also increased medical expenses by approximately a factor of two.	0.318618568811537
Indirect burden due to increased days off of work, unemployment and earlier retirement are also significant in Parkinson's disease.	0.37119671780020624
This study oncludes that a treatment which could prevent or retard disease progression as well as a treatment that delays or reduces motor complications would not only ameliorate the situation of patients suffering from PD, but would also lead to significant reductions in cost for the national health care system.	0.5320548889634327

Although considerable progress has already been made in both directions, these are still, at the present time, experimental processes that require further in-depth investigation prior to widespread clinical application.	0.6124883159313048
In addition to its use following the cryopreservation of ovarian tissue, IVM of immature oocytes also plays a significant role in promoting current methods of assisted reproduction.	0.4947553587334646
The successful maturation of immature oocytes could lead to improved assessment of the oocytes obtained by follicular puncture and to a reduction in the incidence and risk of ovarian stimulation.	0.7148805882665334
IVM is therefore expected to broaden the spectrum of individual treatment regimens as in the case of PCOS patients, for instance, increasing treatment efficacy by the additional acquisition of immature oocytes or by "rescuing" IVF cycles with unintentionally immature oocytes.	0.5559707660254666
Background: Transconjunctival peribulbar anesthesia is reported to permit better identification of the bulbar limits because of a better view into the fornix; it is also said to be less painful compared to transcutaneous peribulbar anesthesia.	0.6199947511861007
The aim of our study was to compare the two injection techniques.	0.6282827665039902
The German Registry for Hearing Loss in Children (DZH) processes nationwide data from audiological centers.	0.3852381877540241
Coping with the accrued data and its subsequent management and analysis requires a high degree of security and control.	0.49276281713147513
To establish a nationwide registry it is necessary at an early stage to take into consideration the legal requirements of the participating states.	0.7069688332563563
Use of the DZH as an example demonstrates how a pragmatic solution can be reached.	0.5979281000357528
Special issues concerning data collection, transfer, storage and deletion, coding strategies to ensure anonymity, checking for duplicate entries, data separation, and automated data analysis and data protection are explained.	0.4243218919304231
Cardiac fibroblasts are known to have high affinity corticoid receptors for aldosterone and account for the accumulation of collagen within the interstitium of the rat myocardium in acquired and genetic hypertension.	0.4717599181624891
This interstitial fibrosis is an important determinant of pathologic hypertrophy in chronic heart failure.	0.48570683144367466
The social environment in which obstetrics is offered today is characterized by a mentality of weariness: weariness by affluence, ignorance and by misunderstanding.	0.37524507662844453
