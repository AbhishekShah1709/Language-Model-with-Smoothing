Between 1988 and 1991, group 1 and 2 patients received implant tissue-supported prostheses (using two to four implants).	1.101304457921596
Due to prosthesis-related pressure lesions, the strategy has now been changed.	0.9128428508129262
Since 1992, group 1 patients have received exclusively implant-supported prostheses (using five to six implants), while group 2 patients have received implant tissue-supported constructions (using four implants).	1.1192206132117521
Special criteria for the success of implant-supported maxillofacial prosthetics were drawn up.	0.9066631429783253
With an average follow-up period of 37 months, 160 fixtures (91%) were clinically osseointegrated.	1.1011783643378086
Both types of restoration provided sufficient oral rehabilitation.	0.6010386008323161
However, only completely implant-supported prostheses avoided soft tissue ulcers.	1.2328427180093655
The overall success rate was about 77% after 7 years in group 1 and about 87% after 9 years in group 2.	1.304665161878032
With regard to implants placed after strategy change, the 5-year success rate was approximately 86% (group 1) and 94% (group 2).	1.1799316506978288
In irradiated patients, an exclusively implant-supported prosthesis without any mucosal contact (thus avoiding soft tissue ulcers with a potential to develop osteoradionecrosis) should therefore be fabricated.	1.071519556277298
Implant tissue-supported restoration is also possible in nonirradiated oral cancer patients.	0.940569643287737
Extracorporal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has been postulated as an additional therapeutic option in nonunion after fracture treatment.	1.0627398329110063
We have reexamined patients with nonunions treated at our institution to evaluate the efficacy of the method.	0.9529143929936574
In a prospective nonrandomized study patients were investigated with a minimum duration of nonunion of 6 months.	1.2147664118097259
Following 2 cycles of ESWT with 2000 impulses/18 kV, the reevaluation was performed at 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment.	1.1506292727133365
A total of 27 pseudarthroses was reevaluated, in 11 one or more reosteosyntheses had been performed prior to ESWT.	1.1328928357558459
Following ESWT we found a success rate of 41 % (n = 11).	1.321205699173174
The clinical evidence of subjective, clinical improvement was found in 5 of these patients within 1 month, in all of these patients within a period of 3 months.	1.2661800237383634
Radiologic evidence of improvement occurred in none of these patients within 1 month, in all of these patients within 6 months.	1.0630374888233998
ESWT appears to represent an additional treatment option in patients with longstanding nonunion.	0.9598542770096137
If no improvement occurs, the maximum delay of reosteosynthesis is three months.	0.9739209784904271
Over a period of 11 years a total of 140 liver resections for non-colorectal, non-neuroendocrine hepatic metastases were performed in 127 patients (73 women, 54 men; median age 53 years).	1.0529210108972364
There were 120 first, 14 second and 6 third liver resections.	0.9863781523861376
Primary tumors were: breast cancer (n = 34), leiomyosarcoma (n = 20), pancreatic cancer (n = 16), renal cell carcinoma (n = 13), melanoma (n = 9), gastric cancer (n = 9), lung cancer (n = 6) and adrenal cancer (n = 6) and miscellaneous tumors (n = 14).	1.3095287568688363
Extrahepatic tumor manifestation (including synchronous primary tumors) was found in 69/140 cases (49 %); 61 of 120 patients with a first liver resection had extrahepatic tumor (51 %).	1.209549988876799
In the 120 first liver resections, 82 (68 %) R0, 13 (11 %) R1 and 25 (21 %) R2 excisions were possible.	1.2694096237562909
Median survival after first liver resection was 20 months; after R0 resection a median survival of 28 months and after R1/2 resection of 8 months was achieved.	0.946771579866472
The 5-year survival rate was 16 % for the total group, 24 % in patients with R0 resection and 0 % for R1/2 resections.	1.4389918368470076
After a second liver resection (n = 14) there was a median survival of 28 months (5-year-survival-rate of 21 %) for all patients and of 41 months (5-year survival rate 38 %) after R0 resection.	1.2854857218158038
Morbidity and mortality after the first liver resection were 32.5 % and 5.8 %, respectively.	1.4035169625685882
In patients without extrahepatic tumor at the time of the first liver resection a median survival of 32 months (5-year survival rate 25 %) and 7 months was achieved after R0 resection and R1/2 resection, respectively.	1.1517036383683967
In case of extrahepatic tumor the median survival was 24 months (5-year survival rate 23 %) for R0 resection compared to 8 months after R1/2 resection.	1.128022203584535
These data suggest that not the presence of extrahepatic tumor but rather the possibility of a R0 resection is most decisive for the prognosis after liver resection.	1.0809572174519229
We conclude that patients with liver metastases of non-colorectal, non-neuroendocrine tumors may benefit from liver resection.	1.0299697275288082
Similar to colorectal metastases, a second or third liver resection can be worthwhile in selected cases.	0.9217612630919193
Even in more unfavorable tumor entities, several cases of long-term survival were observed after surgical therapy.	1.215522959695843
Therefore, the indication for liver resection should be considered carefully in every single case.	1.052873233658443
Generalizations about the outcomes of psychotherapy are essentially based on research on brief therapies with quite short follow-up.	0.8710507008012038
The present paper is a survey of some of the findings in an effectiveness study of psychoanalysis and long-term psychotherapy, typically psychoanalytically oriented, in private practice.	1.1412580831595907
The design was a three-wave panel comprising more than 700 patients.	0.8989167942904527
At the end of the third wave, 418 patients in different phases of treatment remained in the sample.	0.8650081629977552
Across a reconstructed time scale covering roughly seven years, before, during, and after treatment, the 74 psychoanalysis cases described a very positive development, whereas the development among the 331 psychotherapy cases was moderately positive.	1.179413412321432
The findings emphasize the importance of extended follow-up.	0.8044812344243438
When therapist variables are considered, therapeutic experience had complex or mixed associations with patients outcome.	0.9445065547186358
Especially positive were high age and many years, in private practice, after licensing.	1.0421641511470905
Therapeutic ideals and attitudes divided the therapist group in three subgroups, one of which was characterized by purely classical psychoanalytic views on the values of support, friendliness etc.	0.9566910300306731
Therapists in the classically psychoanalytic cluster were found to do poorly with patients in psychotherapy, in contrast to patients in psychoanalysis.	1.1728119461630477
It is concluded that psychoanalysis and psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy are qualitatively different.	0.7865095513780975
Experimental studies and open clinical trials have suggested intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) as a potentially effective treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS).	1.0003934011557654
The Austrian Immunoglobulin in Multiple Sclerosis (AIMS) study tested this assumption by examining 148 patients with relapsing-remitting MS in a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled fashion (75 IVIg, 73 placebo).	0.9331569384812356
Monthly administration of IVIg in a dosage of 0.15-0.20 g/kg over a period of 2 years slowed the progression of or even reversed disability as evident in a total of 24% of patients and almost halved the number of relapses in comparison to placebo treatment.	1.1266743511752524
Therapeutic efficacy was noted within the first 6 months of treatment and was not correlated to the severity of disability (mild neurological sins without disability to ambulatory with assistance) at study entry.	1.1308835047469745
Overall the magnitude of treatment effects of IVIg was comparable to that reported for beta-interferon and copolymer 1.	1.0036124152605421
Further ongoing studies will have to clarify the future role of IVIg in the treatment of MS, in particular in the progressive forms of the disease.	1.1223615611808355
Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is a rare cause of ischemic heart disease.	0.9071920310729852
Incidence, etiology and optimal treatment are ill-defined.	0.7768292949814913
Between July 1995 and December 1997, we prospectively identified 42 patients (36 men, six women, mean age 59 +/- 12 years) with spontaneous coronary artery dissection among 3803 consecutive angiographic examinations in which the diagnosis of coronary artery disease was established for the first time (incidence 1.1%).	1.134290859453956
In comparison to the remaining study population with stable angina pectoris (8 cases of spontaneous coronary artery dissection among 2852 patients; incidence: 0.3%), the incidence of spontaneous coronary artery dissection was significantly higher in the patient subgroups with acute myocardial infarction (13/450; 2.9%) and with unstable angina pectoris or postinfarction angina (21/501; 4.2%).	1.1846167264709218
Dissection was most frequently located in the left anterior descending coronary artery (19 cases), followed by the right coronary artery (15 cases) and the left circumflex coronary artery (8 cases).	1.3280813587431155
Because of an ambiguous angiographic lesion appearance intravascular ultrasound imaging was performed in 13 patients to confirm the diagnosis.	0.9412027229767324
The presumed etiology of spontaneous coronary artery dissection was atherosclerotic plaque rupture in 35 cases, heavy physical exercise in four cases and hormonal influences related to pregnancy and contraception in one case.	0.9809165679497387
In two cases, no obvious risk factor could be identified.	0.9210967682547426
Therapy consisted of intracoronary stenting in 24 patients (including ten patients with acute myocardial infarction), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 8 patients and balloon angioplasty (PTCA) in seven patients.	1.2118388906897695
Three patients were treated conservatively.	1.0555569617807328
Introduction: Since the introduction of laparoscopic hernioplasty the TAPP procedure (transabdominal preperitoneal approach) has become the most widely used technique.	1.1541208263532043
Many surgeons have changed to the total extraperitoneal approach (TEP), because they fear the consequences of a peritoneal lesion.	1.187144216248566
Method: We evaluated our results with TAPP in a retrospective study, with special attention to complications caused by the approach.	1.298372080726509
We operated on 460 hernias in 390 patients in a period of 5 years.	1.0153939525453028
Results: Complication rates and recurrence rates were similar to those after TEP.	1.1027777576017677
There was a marked learning curve with decrease of both rates during the evaluated years.	1.001923252415068
There were no complications related to the transabdominal approach other than trocar hernias, the rate of which could be reduced by eliminating the learning curve and by using smaller trocar diameter.	1.0699536662876423
Conclusion: We see no reason to change from TAPP to the TEP technique.	1.1211634370945653
This article examines the use and acceptance of ticket machines, automatic teller machines (ATMs) and telephone cards by the elderly in four European regions.	0.9492796430632243
The analyses are based on data from an international project entitled "Keeping the Elderly Mobile", collected in Mannheim (former West Germany; N=404 home-dwelling respondents), Chemnitz (former East Germany; N=400), Ancona (Italy; N=600), and Jyväskylä (Finland; N=618).	1.1033026879596188
The random sample was stratified by age and gender in each country.	0.7964953716389223
Two generations of men and women (aged 55-74 and 75+ years, respectively) participated in the study.	0.9879295031631912
Results show that respondents generally made little use of the three technologies under investigation: in fact, the majority of respondents does not use them at all.	1.1677377697869447
The most frequently used devices were ATMs in Chemnitz and ticket machines and telephone cards in Mannheim.	0.7564806802164095
On the basis of logistic regression analysis, age was the most important explanatory factor for the three technologies and for all four regions, i.e., the users were mostly the "young-old."	1.1026357614591857
Education was a more important variable than gender.	0.8760530224798065
In all four regions, the majority of the respondents who used the technologies assessed felt that each of them made life easier; nevertheless, ticket machines make life more difficult to almost every third user in Mannheim.	1.0382236791965718
Interesting differences and similarities among the towns were also found.	0.6947787861327769
The present study exhibits preliminary results regarding elderly and technology which future research should investigate in greater depth.	1.014159090110285
In order to examine the efficacy of whole body acupuncture additionally applied to drug treatment in depression, a single-blind placebo-controlled study with 70 inpatients administered to three different treatment groups has been carried out.	1.0899920675308503
All patients were pharmacologically treated with the tetracyclic antidepressant mianserin.	1.04656982205924
The verum group (n=22) received acupuncture at specific points considered to be effective in the treatment of depression.	1.0122348852750482
The placebo group (n=24) was treated with acupuncture at non-specific locations and the control group (n=24) received only pharmacological treatment.	0.9693082342207388
Acupuncture was applied three times a week over a period of four weeks.	0.9637705093570715
Psychopathology was rated by judges blind to verum/placebo conditions twice a week over eight weeks with the CGI, GAS, BRMS and BfS rating scales.	0.8360372780560116
Additionally applied acupuncture improved the course of depression more than pharmacological treatment with mianserin did by itself.	0.9098210770480729
However, we could not detect any differences between placebo and verum acupuncture.	1.320738768491623
Acute heart failure consists of decompensated chronic heart failure, acute pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock.	0.8260321650718141
While decompensated heart failure shows little therapeutic difficulties therapy of pulmonary edema is more sophisticated.	0.9132589489081057
Cardiogenic shock, however is still a therapeutic challenge.	1.1765501179825955
For therapy of cardiogenic shock positive inotropes, phosphodiesterase-inhibitors and various assist devices are currently in use.	0.922966576421822
If it is not possible to correct underlying diseases, mortality of cardiogenic shock is still high.	1.139225080560531
Two years after the diagnosis of Sézary syndrome, a 50-year old female patient experienced attacks of painful ischemia of both hands and feet, leading to acral necrosis.	1.1001970252295024
Another 59-year old patient presented with severe pain in his feet, secondary to ischemia.	1.1952402870481726
This was the first symptom of a T-cell-chronic lymphocytic leukemia.	1.0844009823747605
Similar cases have only occasionally been described.	0.7812470439547173
The relationship between acral ischemia and T-cell-lymphoma is not clear but is discussed in this article.	1.104818650994177
The clinical features of progression sensorineural hearing loss and vertigo in combina-tion with the radiologic finding of a contrast- enhancing mass within the inner auditory canal are suggestive of an acoustic neuroma.	1.0157221593792747
We report our findings in a 57-year-old woman with known mixed connective tissue disease who was presumed to have a neuroma.	1.0623373774869829
A large malignant lymphoma of the cerebellopontine angle presented clinically with a primary acoustic none palsy and no other central neurological deficits.	0.9096756098697124
Both the primary radiological examinations and the exclusively peripheral nerve palsy failed to indicate manifestationes of a lymphoma.	0.8946554069182272
The development of a progressive facial palsy within 8 weeks of presentation and an atypi-cal occipital headache were uncommon findings for an acoustic neuroma.	0.9844786664537237
Such changes in symptoms despite the occurrence of car-dinal symptoms require further diagnostic measures.	0.8079705366627664
Manifestations of a malignant lymphoma in the cerebellopontine angle are extremely rare.	0.9002835180586578
To our knowledge a case of an intracerebral lymphoma in a patient with Sjögren's syndrome has never been reported before.	1.2093355468044142
Cutaneous blisters on a corpse are not only of forensic interest regarding their etiology and genesis but also the time of origin, particularly the problem of vital, agonal, supravital or postmortem occurrence of cutaneous blisters could be of forensic value.	1.147104308829306
The aim of this work was to summarize the causative spectrum of cutaneous blisters, including poisonous plants and animals, drugs and toxic substances.	1.1483222104449387
The time of origin of cutaneous blisters were evaluated in selected forensically relevant cases.	1.0607621587868072
The purpose of the present study was to compare two sedation regimens with either propofol (P) or methohexital (M) for elective magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in children with respect to safety, side effects, recovery, and discharge time.	1.1788439727219675
Pharmacological thrombolysis is a valuable therapeutic modality for embolic arterial occlusion.	0.8960982025626051
Nevertheless, thorough evaluation of the indications is imperative to avoid serious complications.	1.1690759099034642
The most frequent complication is hemorrhage.	1.0410609741080648
Of these, the intracerebral hemorrhages are rare, but when they do occur they are an immediate threat to life they are accompanied by very severe complications, and they have an extremely poor prognosis.	1.0969074765183295
Within 58 months 361 patients were treated at our neurosurgical clinic with intracerebral hematomas.	1.0288693627158672
In 22 patients (6.1%) the hematoma developed as a complication of systemic thrombolysis.	1.1485619610402944
Two of these patients had been treated for occlusion of the central retinal artery.	1.3294626482411869
One patient died: the other survived but was severely disabled.	1.1875887285222733
The latter patient experienced no benefit from the thrombolysis as for as the underlying ophthalmologic disease was concerned.	0.9450357186355262
These worrying examples stress the necessity for careful evaluation of risk factors and the natural history of the underlying disease for which systemic thrombolysis is indicated.	1.0734086166992252
Local selective (or superselective) thrombolysis is preferable to the systemic procedure, provided that the indications are equally strictly observed and are less likely to lead to severe complications.	1.1036208984664089
We report on a 61-year-old patient with considerable insufficiency of a quadricuspid aortic valve and coronary three vessel disease.	0.985989692126044
The congenital quadricuspid aortic valve has become symptomatic due to the development of (post-endocarditic) insufficiency only in the advanced stage of life.	1.0124522064726107
It was treated by replacement of the aortic valve and bypass myocardial revascularization.	0.9080307191566863
The physiopathology of quadricuspid aortic valve will be discussed.	0.5368959152979672
Due to its high prevalence, atopic dermatitis is an important problem in the dermatologic practice.	1.0786925488159307
The chronicity of the disease together with numerous triggering factors of varying individual impact create a complex situation which is difficult to manage under the current circumstances in our health care system.	1.0032744582291666
We describe the concept of an outpatient clinic especially for atopic dermatitis as established in our Department of Dermatology.	1.2574176180054981
A high degree of standardization is combined with a high measure of individual care.	0.975024330142571
The aims of this clinic are an optimized outpatient management of atopic dermatitis, the gathering of epidemiologic data, the performance of controlled studies, and potentially the reduction of costs.	1.0767427735070454
Abstract:  Traumatic cerebral aneurysms are rare in severely head-injured patients.	0.99765601863556
We present the first case of a traumatic aneurysm of the A1/A2 junction.	1.1171751851341405
Purpose: Although the relationship between optic pits and macular lesions was described nearly a century ago, the pathology and pathogenesis of macular detachment remain unclear.	1.2080105028527828
Recent OCT studies have shown schisislike spaces in connection with the disc.	0.880896181516001
None of the hypotheses of pathogenesis proposed so far could have been proven.	0.9250990276364529
Besides the hypothesis of exudation, the role of the vitreoretinal interface is kept in the background of discussion.	0.9528401202726197
We describe a case of macular detachment associated with optic pit that regained full vision after pars plana vitrectomy with laser coagulation and gas tamponade over a follow-up of 26 months.	0.9562145109270646
The purpose of our case report is to emphasize the role of the vitreoretinal interface in the pathogenesis of macular detachment associated with optic pits.	1.0664432391301106
Sclerosing adenosis of the prostate is a benign lesion, which was not recognized until a few years ago.	1.1982706764797055
As in sclerosing adenosis of the breast, a background of various hyperplastic changes is commonly also present in the prostate.	1.0828506103432087
An incidence of 2.8 % was reported in one series of resected hyperplastic prostatic glands.	1.1976137404629794
As demonstrated in this case report, the main problem lies in the differential diagnosis between sclerosing adenosis and highly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the prostate.	1.120224288636721
Histological diagnosis of sclerosing adenosis based on routine HE sections is supplemented by immunohistochemical methods.	0.7702957676883121
Important diagnostic criteria of sclerosing adenosis are the presence of basal cell differentiation, which is demonstrated by cytokeratin 903, and signs of possible myoepithelial differentiation, with expression of S-100 and/or smooth muscle actin.	1.2008291484598894
These antibody expressions are lacking with in the presence of adenocarcinoma of the prostate.	0.8014151322342603
Nevertheless, in a small number of cases this differential diagnosis remains impossible, even after the application of immunohistochemical methods.	1.381600163613105
Further studies are needed to shed some light on the relations between sclerosing adenosis, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma of the prostate.	0.784298984384603
So far, there appears to be no evidence of a direct relationship between sclerosing adenosis of the prostate and an elevated risk of carcinoma.	1.2216899830077195
Benign intracavitary cardiac tumors lead to "malignant" complications, so early diagnosis and adequate treatment are of vital importance.	1.0693770854039357
Our investigation summarizes a 10-year experience after surgical treatment of 29 patients suffering from benign intracavitary cardiac tumors.	1.0021137785185341
The postoperative histological examination revealed a myxoma in 27 cases; in 2 cases a papillary fibroelastoma was diagnosed.	1.004057806480181
The main symptom in 19 patients was dyspnea.	0.898807614408325
In 8 cases an embolic event occurred.	0.8275024999164173
All patients underwent extirpation of the tumor.	0.8634692214397217
Early mortality was 10 %, while late mortality was 4 %.	1.1359720899053471
The treatment of choice of benign intracavitary cardiac tumors is extirpation, which, due to unpredictable embolic complications, is to be carried out immediately should the tumor have a lobulated tuberous surface.	1.2030610468050311
In such cases the descriptive function of echocardiography is of considerable importance.	0.9350638446092249
We present a case of a 48 year old man who complained of progressive dyspnoe.	1.134854992028414
Radiograph revealed a large tumor in the left lung.	1.1640696882928334
Biopsy was performed and revealed beneath a normal bronchial epithelium polymorph tumor cells admixed with some histiocytes.	0.878274058086252
These tumor cells were strongly pigmented and expressed HMB-45 and protein S-100 immunohistochemically.	0.9400643143465679
Malignant melanoma of the bronchus was included in the differential diagnosis.	0.8228946653807468
A thoracotomy and left lower lobe resection was performed.	0.7592007223991184
The lung is an uncommon localisation of angiomyolipoma with so far three reported cases.	0.9687611403642504
Lipoma, leiomyoma and lymphangioleiomyomatosis have to be included in the differential diagnosis.	0.7125630190030124
The peculiarity of this case is the presence of multiple pigmented tumor cells that express HMB-45.	1.074775061506815
This has not been reported yet.	1.0501901190380944
Background: The maximum number of cell divisions of a certain cell population is genetically fixed so that aging cells become non-dividing (senescent) at least.	1.1347257656885308
This replicative life span, also known as "hayflick limit", is probably defined by a "critical" length of the telomeres.	1.0772593553048193
Telomeres are special DNA-sequences located at the four ends of the chromosomes which are shortened with each cell cycle.	0.8899906755541103
Cells of most, but not all malignant tumours have been shown to reactivate the enzyme telomerase so that telomeres can be reconstructed, "Hayflick limit" can be overcome, and unlimited cell division can be established.	1.1993524264769415
This study was undertaken to elucidate whether telomerase reactivation is used by uveal melanoma cells.	0.9270706384185946
A total of 113 patients with acute and chronic instability of the ulnar collateral ligament metacarpal phalangeal (MP) joint of the thumb were treated surgically between 1980 and 1985; 82 patients were followed up after a mean period of 10 years.	1.1375553549921606
Of 59 patients with acute injuries, 52 were painfree with full stability of the MP joint; 23 patients with chronic instability and tendon grafting also showed restoration of stability.	1.0660479743751885
Nevertheless, the range of motion was reduced severely and opposition of the thumb was impaired.	1.117475381559804
The results of follow-up reveal that acute reattachment of the injured ulnar collateral ligament is more effective.	1.1234869733472115
The purpose of this study was to assess the role of spiral computed tomography (SCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the preoperative work-up of patients with pancreatic carcinoma, regarding local resectability and vascular involvement.	0.976665322648568
Methods and materials: A total of 28 patients (19 men and 9 women; mean age 58 years) with known or highly suspected carcinoma of the pancreas were included in this study.	1.249929816893956
All patients prospectively underwent MRI ( +/-  gadolinium-DTPA) and SCT (3-phase examination) as preoperative diagnostic imaging studies, and laparotomy was carried out within 7 days, irrespective of the MRI or SCT findings.	1.151063929769873
SCT and MR studies were reviewed independently by two radiologists, without knowing the results of the surgical exploration.	1.1639397496684207
Standardized image analysis was correlated with findings at laparatomy.	0.7356358860621917
Results: Laparotomy identified 10 patients to be suitable for surgical resection and 18 pancreatic carcinomas to be unresectable.	1.1185181512661753
In 17 of 18 non-resectable carcinomas MRI and SCT were able to obtain correct information about unresectability (sensitivity 94 %), in 7 (MRI), resp.	1.2377940502301974
8 (SCT) carcinomas were correctly considered to be resectable (sensitivity 70 % for MRI and 80 % for SCT).	1.322240816276083
The presence of vascular involvement was depicted by SCT with a sensitivity of 82-100 % and 62-100 % by MRI.	1.2125793669036256
The specificity varied between 85-100 % for SCT and 77-100 % for MRI.	1.2642972480944619
Conclusion: Both MRI and SCT are good techniques for the preoperative work-up of pancreatic carcinomas in order to obtain a correct assessment of local resectability.	1.318579292424592
Pancreatic pseudocysts occur as a complication in the natural course of acute or chronic pancreatitis, with a spontaneous resolution rate of 40 % to 60 %.	1.25670291070257
The incidence of pseudocysts in the course of chronic pancreatitis amounts to 60 %.	0.9150972940036481
Pseudocysts have to be differentiated from neoplastic or congenital pancreatic cystic lesions.	0.7861539261576544
Careful diagnostic work-up including ERCP and CT scanning is mandatory in the management of pancreatic pseudocysts.	0.8869478528390587
The indication for treatment depends on the development of symptoms or complications.	0.9236058888223475
Pain is present in up to 90 % of all patients, and the rate of complications varies between 2 % and 55 %.	1.2638408216993449
Pancreatic pseudocysts are usually an epiphenomenon of chronic pancreatitis.	0.8542811630280186
Pancreatic resection therefore represents a causative treatment.	0.5706202186756776
New percutaneous and endoscopic techniques for draining pseudocysts are challenging the previous hegemony of the surgeon.	0.8421932268202108
However, so far no prospectively collected data are available comparing the results of interventional and surgical drainage procedures.	1.3485388294249785
Therefore, in most symptomatic cases surgery is considered the treatment of choice.	1.3923255790559779
A 28-year-old drug addict who had injected intravenously died of hepatic failure and coma caused by fulminant hepatitis (simultaneously: hepatitis A, persistent hepatitis B, hepatitis C and superinfection by delta hepatitis).	0.9602438450451113
Liver histology disclosed cirrhosis with severe necrotizing hepatitis and extensive microvesicular steatosis, compatible with a delta virus infection.	0.7756063263586546
Moderate pulmonary fat embolism (grade I-II according to Falzi) was accompanied by fat deposits in alveolar macrophages.	0.9545824748076769
It is postulated that protracted fat mobilization from necrotizing hepatocytes may be the cause of pulmonary fat embolism; the extravasation of fat from the vessels into the alveoli results in phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages.	0.8888382276312656
Suicide on railways (either by being run over by or jumping in front of a train) is one of the 'hardest' suicide methods.	0.9965089363776908
In Austria, 617 suicides or attempted suicides on railways were registered between 1990 and 1994.	0.7004296466700524
This amounts to 5.73 % of all suicides committed in this period with women showing a higher percentage than men.	1.1827515711753367
In both men and women there was a predominance of younger age groups; the mean age was higher in women than in men (48.0 vs 40.4 years).	1.230408653999163
There was a significant increase in suicides or attempted suicides on railways after a television report on the stress suffered by train drivers concerning possible suicides.	0.9472660109029012
Persuading the mass media to treat the subject of 'suicide' with reserve and with greater caution, even when not presenting a distinct suicide model, may be of importance in general suicide prevention.	1.1350432706914604
For decades the results of elective lymph node dissection (ELND) are differently discussed, so that it is not definitely recommended at present the less so since the morbidity of this operation can't be neglected.	1.0765646152163506
Since the beginning of 1995 we practice a gamma-probe guided sentinel lymphonodectomy (SLNE) on patients with melanoma from a Breslow tumor thickness of 1 mm upward, after injecting a colloidal 99m-Tc labelled tin (II) - sulfid solution around the tumor or the scar, if the tumor has been excided before.	1.0249540792069503
By this method, that allows a selection of patients who according clinically to a stage I or II (UICC) but even histopathologically to a stage III and who are profiting of a removal of the regional lymph nodes, the sentinel node can be exactly localised, tissue-sparing removed at minimal complication rates and the completeness of the removal can be verified by measurements of the radioactivity.	1.1752824619888476
When finding metastases in the histopathological examination of the node a dissection of the whole region follows.	0.926536118355011
During rehabilitation of patients suffering from a recent hip fracture, we evaluated the development of several aspects of their subjective well-being (n=87, age: 70 to 94).	1.050633619132547
In most cases, a deterioration of subjective well-being due to the consequences of the hip fracture could be prevented; the well-being improved in most cases.	1.1547703813073102
When discharged, the subjective well-being of our patients was comparable to the well-being of similar-aged people living at home.	1.2442097773399752
Antidepressants are used in demented patients for treating depressive symptoms as well as other non-cognitive symptoms including agitation, aggression and irritability.	0.9186598347132346
As patients are usually elderly, a dose adjustment is mandatory for all classes of antidepressants.	1.010699370639645
New antidepressants such as the SSRIs and the reversible MAO inhibitors should be the first-line agents in these patients, because their efficacy is not different from that of classic TCA, but they have advantages regarding frequency of adverse effects, ease of use and safety.	1.1088449217416068
Improvement in cognitive performance, however, may not be expected from the new antidepressants.	1.049357800220872
For the treatment of agitation, aggression and irritabiltiy, antipychotics and benzodiazepines are in frequent use, although their adverse effects are particularly problematic in demented patiens.	0.9505117193014957
Good alternatives are the antidepressant trazodone and citalopram.	0.6628337647061795
All medications mentioned have been studied on small patient samples, so treatment recommendations must be given cautiously.	1.0311575881251502
The application of laser energy to joint capsular tissues resulted in the reduction of the joint capsule.	0.9154745556665984
Primary clinical results of combined laser-assisted capsular shrinkage (LACS) and multiple suture repair (Caspari) for arthroscopic stabilization procedure of anterior shoulder instability are presented.	1.1412573986980894
From July 1997 to October 1998, 18 patients (2 female, 16 male; mean age 27.9 years; range 16-42 years) with anterior instability and recurrent dislocations of the shoulder received a combined arthroscopic stabilization procedure.	1.2365385181756705
The operative technique involved the use of transglenoid sutures to repair the labrum and shift the capsule (Caspari) and LACS.	0.9478829053652599
Laser energy was applied using a Ho: YAG laser (10 W, 1 J, 10 pulses/s, total energy: 1500-2000 J).	1.0851764625644837
The patients were followed for an average of 9 months (range 4-20 months).	1.2426585251455742
From June 1992 to Februrary 1996, arthroscopic suture stabilization without laser shrinkage was performed on 17 patients (2 female, 15 male; age 25.9 years/range 18-37 years).	1.0776831801820288
The average follow-up in this group was 4.5 years (range 2-5.5 years), and we found 41.2% (7/17) recurrent dislocations.	1.4298388684883947
After combined arthroscopic procedure of multiple suture repair (Caspari) and LACS, a significantly (chi-squared test, P = 0.05) lower recurrence rate was obtained.	1.0124965687223646
Only in one patient (5.6%, 1/18) did we find this failure.	1.374629582342178
No complications occurred in either group.	0.32744016273516596
The combination of arthroscopic LACS and Caspari's technique of multiple suture repair in cases of posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability and recurrent dislocations is promising.	0.9978681109560793
Although, no long-term results are available, the method seems to be suitable for associating low recurrence rates with the advantages of arthroscopic surgery.	1.1827338275312402
Simple bone cysts are asymptomatic, benign lesions which are usually an incidental finding on a radiograph.	1.0431285499419225
Etiology and treatment are controversially discussed.	0.8605790525862392
The weightbearing status of the calcaneus and possible pathologic fracturing lead many authors to recommend therapeutic measures after diagnosis has been made.	0.993300441902542
We present a case report of an intact unicameral bone cyst of the calcaneus concomitant with tibial and talar fractures following crush trauma.	1.1207875916175236
Several types of treatment for simple bone cysts of the calcaneus have been suggested.	1.0479503046975704
The question whether treatment is unconditionally necessary is controversially discussed.	0.8022636650644214
It is the author's opinion, that asymptomatic bone cysts of the calcaneus require no further treatment.	1.1395836557037442
Facial neuromyography is an objective electrophysiologic measurement used to assess prognosis for recovery from facial paralysis.	0.9083405856308289
In the present study variability over time of the amplitude ratio in healthy subjects was investigated.	1.2448461242724058
Twenty healthy subjects underwent four neuromyographic tests at intervals of one week.	0.7186900331219813
The study group consisted of 12 males and 8 females.	0.9080295722396886
Ages ranged from 23 to 36 years.	0.5227264185024856
The stimulation intensity required for supramaximal stimulation was 14.6 mA on average.	0.8567909467740484
The mean of the intra-individual side-to-side difference of the evoked compound action potential was 32.5%.	0.9715957280452238
Results of the four repeated tests ranged from no to 80% side-to-side differences in the same individual.	1.0709869503640153
The hypothesis of symmetrical evoked facial compound potentials was not supported by our data.	0.7773514424752662
As with previous investigators we found significant side-to-side differences in healthy subjects.	0.8761572012031128
Furthermore, we could also show for the first time that the amplitude ratio was not constant in every individual at repeated measurements.	1.225704409522047
We conclude that there is a physiological variability that must be taken into account in the interpretation of facial nerve neuromyography.	1.0421826335765694
To compare patient dose and image quality of electron-beam-CT vs. spiral-CT by means of phantom measurements.	1.0202795223474923
An EBCT scanner (C-150 XP) and a spiral-CT scanner (GE  HiSpeed Advantage) were used to scan three different phantoms.	1.216030332238202
Administered dose, high contrast (HC) resolution, low contrast (LC) lesion detectability and the width of the radiation beams were measured.	1.0238708858146677
EBCT showed 25-35% lower HC resolution in comparison to spiral-CT. LC lesion detectability showed equivalent results for S/N vs. patient dose using 3 mm collimation with EBCT and spiral-CT, whereas spiral-CT was superior for 1,5 and 6 mm collimation.	1.0867357333227106
Dose measurements revealed a 2 fold higher patient dose using EBCT with 1,5 mm or 6 mm collimation compared to spiral-CT using equivalent scan parameters.	0.9651703363502383
No differences were seen using 3 mm collimation.	0.885697222921061
Differences were due to insufficient beamside collimation of the EBCT.	0.6816026021922101
The use of EBCT with 6 mm collimation should be avoided, because of impaired performance.	1.1437053370207184
Using 3 mm collimation, EBCT showed comparable performance like state of the art spiral-CT despite lower HC resolution.	0.9528912931688099
In an experimental study, the biomechanical qualities of the combined Kirschner wire osteosynthesis (KWO) in the unstable Colles' fracture were analyzed.	1.0579389662140937
This type of pin fixation is our preferred osteosynthesis in the treatment of unstable Colles' fracture because it allows immediate functional therapy.	0.9879515140755667
It represents a modification of Kapandji's dynamic KWO, compensating for the insufficient volar stability by means of the conventional static KWO.	0.9318974632588088
Clinical experience according to the anatomical and functional results, was very encouraging suggesting that a clinical concept based on the biomechanical principles of combined KWO and its single components should be constituted.	1.139263594934345
Simulation of the unstable Colles' fracture was realized by dorsal wedge osteotomy of the distal end of the radius using cadaveric material.	0.9289418265742264
This fracture model was subsequently pinned using the different KWO types and tested by a standardized vector energy testing device regarding its stability in the four main loading directions.	0.9885313398001707
The combined KWO unifies the advantage of volar stability of the conventional KWO with the high dorsal stability of dynamic KWO.	1.0096678621511914
The main functional principle of dynamic KWO with regard to its axial stability consists in the repositioning of the dorsal bone fragmentation zone and hence the reconstitution of cortical load transmission.	0.9462953365462241
Besides its good stabilization, dynamic KWO also leads to optimal alignment of the distal metaphyseal fragment.	0.980183683008677
Furthermore, the experiments yielded important information about technical aspects of the surgical procedure, which helps us to avoid anatomical and functional deficiencies.	1.1161732361858927
Based on these experimental findings, the surgical technique of combined KWO was standardized.	1.287965775827545
Purpose: It is difficult to measure the topography of the cornea with high resolution and visualize it on a map displaying refraction.	1.1746044915266538
This is demonstrated by the ongoing improvement and further development of different methods and by the fact that users of these techniques are not always satisfied.	1.225514340957946
We present the case of a 2-year-old boy who was brought to hospital with extensive scalding of the face.	1.0946111631445261
The clinicians raised the suspicion of a physical maltreatment of the child.	0.7754157224569549
Because of the morphological findings the medico-legal expert came to the conclusion that maltreatment was proven.	0.9069008725409727
During the criminal proceedings at the appeal court contrary opinions on the morphological findings of the injury between the clinical expert and the medico-legal expert became obvious.	1.035993875282938
Findings of the physical examination of the child and the experimental studies on immersion and pouring of water and the influence of clothing in case of wetting with hot water were presented which confirmed that the injury was caused by maltreatment.	0.9787561262817487
The opinion of the clinical expert which supported the case of the accused could be refuted.	1.1668878804388239
During the final legal proceedings the opinions of the clinical expert had been sufficient for the court to justify an acquittal "in dubio pro reo".	0.9568438468877929
Anterior thoracoscopic interbody stabilization and fusion was performed in 163 patients.	0.8412590207353013
Lesions treated were located between T4 and L3, most frequently occuring at T12/L2.	0.9293574288685497
Operative time decreased dramatically as experience was gained with the procedure.	0.7350084101600064
2 patients early in the series successfully were converted to an open procedure.	0.707648044263973
One positioning related pressure harm on the thoracodorsal nerve and one irritation of the L1 root at the entrance site were both transitory.	0.8148740980287578
Postoperative control by X-ray and CTscan showed correct positioning of the bone graft, as well as the fixation device in all patients.	1.1770560911463948
Our experience with this minimally invasive procedure demonstrated the feasibility of the method.	0.8864906287578499
Major advantages compared to the open procedure are reduced morbidity of the approach, postoperative pain reduction, early recovery of function and shortened hospital stay.	1.1196699695539103
In order to restore function and esthetics in mandibular hypoplasia, transplantation of osteochondral grafts and the distraction osteogenesis technique are used alternatively.	0.915661783073763
In a retrospective study the indication, growth and complication rate of osteochondral graft and distraction osteogenesis cases in mandibular hypoplasia were compared.	1.0515091399187948
In total, 12 patients (4-14 years old; 7 female, 5 male) with different grades of mandibular hypoplasia received osteochondral grafts (7 costochondral, 5 iliac crest; observation period 4-9 years).	1.1546875928431073
In 5 patients (10-12 years old; 1 female, 4 male), distraction osteogenesis was performed (observation period 10 months to 3 1/2 years).	1.205847288432158
In the results, according to the literature, the range of growth after osteochondral grafting varied considerably, approximate normal growth was noticed in only two cases.	0.9292347851328893
On the other hand, all patients treated by distraction osteogenesis showed a stable increase of bone length as expected.	1.0830023574394378
After osteochondral grafts, adequate growth is to be expected in the minority of cases and it does not seem predictable in individual cases.	1.0385926886772627
Therefore, the indication for osteochondral grafts should be restricted to severe hypoplasia, where the local amount of bone does not allow the use of a distraction device, and to cases where support of the mandibula at the skull base is necessary.	1.1491408093436164
In all other cases of mandibular hypoplasia in children, distraction osteogenesis should be discussed as the primary option, even if in the long term a second surgical procedure should be necesssary.	1.1626899105439734
To evaluate the predictive value of MRI in the early postoperative course after cruciate ligament replacement, a prospective study was performed.	1.287890808196621
Twenty patients with reconstructed anterior and/or posterior cruciate ligament were examined clinically and with contrast-enhanced MRI 2, 12, 24 weeks, 1 and 2 years postoperatively.	1.1847638340018785
The clinical examinations were evaluated according to the scores by Lysholm, OAK and IKDC.	0.7667788104199411
The MRI scans (SP 63, 1.5 Tesla) were evaluated regarding the quality and signal intensity of the reconstructed ligament.	1.2355498267824367
During the first postoperative year a significant increase in signal intensity and inhomogeneity of the neoligament in MRI was observed in 16 patients with an average value for signal/noise of 1.1 2 weeks postoperatively up to 6.9 1 year postoperatively.	1.2506076694511403
In 12 patients the reconstructed ligament could not be evaluated in the 1-year postoperative MRI, whereas none of these patients was suspected clinically of having instability.	1.2070957074110844
In the 2-year postoperative MRI, the signal intensity of the neoligament was found to be decreasing again with improvement in judgement.	1.0819802833467196
Miniplate osteosynthesis is a standard method for the surgical treatment of mandible fractures today.	1.0348757145934149
Apart from easy handling, in the majority of cases it also ensures adequate fracture stability.	1.1060326462383487
The treatment of fractures of very atrophic mandibles as well as mandibular defects and comminuted fractures with miniplates and rigid plates is often difficult or only possible to an inadequate extent.	1.041584868175876
Titanium mesh has proved successful for the treatment of such fractures.	0.9645609943229232
Compared with conventional miniplates this mesh is outstanding for its considerably higher stability due to its given geometry.	0.8767895749331235
The titanium mesh can be adapted and screwed individually in any situation, in contrast to miniplates and rigid plates.	0.9922202921300559
As a result, complications such as fracture gap infections and pseudoarthrosis can be avoided to a great extent.	1.0212118095848661
Non-invasive methods to identify absent or persistent myocardial viability have gained increasing importance in the therapeutic management and risk stratification of patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction.	1.0656258193377386
Myocardial scintigraphy using thallium-201 and positron emission tomography with metabolic imaging of myocardial glucose metabolism, using fluorine-18 fluoro-deoxyglucose, are today the most widely used nuclear methods for the assessment of myocardial viability.	0.9792362076282661
Besides the prediction of reversible regional and global myocardial dysfunction following coronary revascularization, both methods have demonstrated the ability to identify patient subgroups who will benefit most with regard to cardiac prognosis and survival and those patients in whom coronary revascularization has a limited effect with regard to survival and cardiac events.	1.0728223259899559
This short review summarizes the clinical impact of both imaging modalities on todays diagnostic approach in patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction.	0.8047534676393779
An elderly woman was found dead in her farm house lying in a pool of blood and was partially unclothed.	0.8828429590431942
Blood was also discovered in several rooms on the first floor.	0.9284679940739237
The investigation at the scene led to the conclusion of a sexual murder.	1.1978981636097574
The autopsy however revealed the source of the hemorrhage to be a renal artery aneurysm which had ruptured in the adjacent renal pelvis.	1.0890510310847759
The woman has obviously been surprised by the sudden bleeding which produced the impressive pattern of blood stains on the floor and finally a fatal hemorrhage.	0.8719403474766158
A similar case of a ruptured renal artery aneurysm and bleeding to death via the urinary tract has not yet been described.	1.140518327548525
In the ankle (talocrural) joint, the lower end of the tibia and fibula embrace the trochlea tali.	1.1973289042681552
Thus, an approximately uniaxial joint is formed which permits dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of the foot against the leg.	1.1331232682874137
Due to the geometry of the trochlea tali, conjunct lateral rotation of the fibula against the tibia occurs at the tibiofibular articulations synchronously with active dorsiflexion at the ankle joint.	0.9122808387688373
Movements at the talocrural joints are mainly limited by the opposing muscles as well as by strong collateral ligaments.	0.9629614149755593
Talus and calcaneus form a functional unit connected by posterior and anterior articulations.	0.843101079241109
The posterior articulation is the subtalar (talocalcaneal) joint; in the anterior articulation, talar facets of the calcaneus together with the posterior surface of the navicular and the superior fibrocartilaginous surface of the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament form a concavity for the talar head.	1.0642219780697024
Thus, the talocalcaneonavicular joint is a compound and - like the subtalar joint - a multiaxial articulation.	1.2304644467015833
On the weight-bearing foot, the distal tarsus and metatarsus are pronated and supinated against the talus in order to maintain plantigrade contact.	0.9408531132293496
When the foot is off the ground, these movements are modified to eversion and inversion, also involving the calcaneocuboid joint.	0.9906250518340478
In addition, movements between the calcaneus and cuboid also occur during pronative or supinative changes between the fore- and hindfoot.	1.1012617017741828
Limitation of movements is due to leg muscles as well as strong ligaments.	0.7424999088354886
Finally, the cuneonavicular, cuboideonavicular, intercuneiform and cuneocuboid joints permit some additional alterations of the loaded foot in contact with the ground.	0.9077567234912076
A case of primary splenic angiosarcoma with involvement of two accessory spleens is presented.	0.9405953125259435
The tumor cells are immunoreactive for endothelial markers (CD 31, CD 34, factor VIII associated antigen) and express also histiocytic antigens (CD 68, lysozyme, Cathepsin D, alpha-1-antitrypsin, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin) as well as CD 8.	1.0157719859622576
This marker profile suggests that the presented angiosarcoma originates from sinus cells with  histiocytic and endothelial differentiation and may be regarded as the malignant variant of littoral cells angioma.	0.9503724560719065
Despite major advances in knowledge and development of efficient techniques for pain control, many patients on surgical wards suffer from modest to severe pain following surgery or trauma.	0.960141850650596
Therefore, in the University Hospital of Kiel, Germany, an anaesthesiology-based acute pain service (APS) was started in 1985 to improve this situation.	1.2293371599548666
The anaesthesiologist in training who manages the recovery unit serves as an APS for surgical wards and is supervised by a consultant.	0.9233305215892006
The anaesthesists on call are responsible after regular working hours.	0.6874862956106212
The activities of the APS are as follows: 1.	0.7766527576335956
Induction of sufficient postoperative analgesia in the recovery unit for all surgical patients.	0.8955570629257037
Clinical rounds on all patients receiving epidural analgesia (EA), other forms of regional analgesia, or patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) every morning and throughout the day if necessary.	1.102734693615158
Additional consultations for postoperative pain management for other patients on request.	1.0088745003764774
Assessment and documentation of the clinical status of the patient, quality of analgesia, and side effects.	1.0497529392304314
Writing orders for further treatment.	0.5530618451245979
Continuing consultations and informal education for ward nurses, physiotherapists, and surgical staff; formal medical training for ward nurses in postoperative pain management.	0.9502787284097746
From 1985 to 1992, 1947 patients on normal wards were treated (EA: 1736, PCA: 183).	0.9042417634394233
Epidural analgesia was performed using a standard protocol with bupivacaine 0.175% - 0.25% infused continuously with top-ups if needed (mean 240 mg/day, range 75 - 600 mg; median duration 7 days, range 1 - 53, Table 1).	1.1772576587323964
Demand for further treatment was proved by day-to-day withdrawal.	0.913278912123505
Since the introduction of an APS, complications of EA such as hypotension (1985/1986: 5.1%; 1987/1992: 0.5%, Table 3) and insufficient analgesia due to dislocation or other technical complications could be reduced significantly (Table 3).	1.2036587938212937
Dermal infections were seen in 2.6% of patients, with a significantly higher incidence in patients with arteriosclerotic diseases (4.1%).	1.2076134619211618
Epidural opioids were used in only 46 selected cases on surgical wards.	0.8595358728759934
Nevertheless, 2 cases of marked respiratory depression occurred.	1.3420753607693643
The overall risk of complications during postoperative EA could be reduced from 1 : 11 cases in the first 2 years to 1 : 20 in the last 6 years since introducing the APS.	1.1790055634393535
For other regional procedures (e.g., interpleural analgesia) no complications were recorded.	0.9028762172999827
PCA was performed using a standard protocol with tramadol or piritramide without background infusion (Table 6).	0.9433211746309328
The loading dose was titrated in the recovery unit.	0.8186837787433582
The median duration of PCA was 4 days (range 1 - 23); the median dose of piritramide was 45 mg/day (range 3 - 226 mg).	1.1771477011959224
Two cases of somnolence and respiratory depression occurred.	0.7758911280742811
In this period there were 8 potential life-threatening complications due to postoperative pain therapy; 4 occurred during standard surgical pain management (3 cases of severe respiratory depression after i.m.	1.2342787240932411
piritramide (unsuccessfull resuscitation), tramadol, and buprenorphine; 1 small child with multiorgan failure after paracetamol intoxication).	1.014792798369834
In those cases the APS was not involved.	0.7913048938995079
There are insufficient data for comparison of the incidence of complications following standard management of postoperative pain relief without an APS, i.e., i.m.	1.147182467698087
injections of opioids on request, but severe and sometimes lethal complications have been reported.	0.9760692113712575
Since the majority of patients used EA or PCA for several days, it is again emphasised that these techniques should not be restricted to high-dependency areas such as intensive care or recovery units.	1.1164540986917693
The introduction of an APS is an adequate approach to more efficient and safer pain management on surgical wards.	0.8910010316743019
This requires standard protocols (Table 7), standardised monitoring and trained ward nurses.	1.1479632615093573
Lambdoid synostosis can manifest unilaterally, bilaterally or in combination with other craniosynostoses.	0.8161371806444903
Using the concept of fronto-orbital advancement we developed occipital advancement in order to correct unilateral or bilateral lambdoid synostosis.	0.9062776860551213
The process involves striped transversal osteotomy, removal, remodelling and advancement of the occipital region.	0.8200996453481221
It allows precise, reproducible and predictable positioning of the segments.	0.8563353188381145
Artificial sutures are created as a result of the osteotomy.	0.8708378561165084
The remodelling leads to a well-proportioned skull shape and advancement to an increase in the intracranial volume.	0.9104049481865459
This article presents the operative method and the results of 14 patients.	1.1022969148449666
Melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy is a rare neoplasm of neural crest origin.	0.9601284606522918
It almost always occurs in children younger than one year of age with a predilection for the anterior maxillary ridge.	0.9723493948592766
Although it usually follows a benign course, local destruction as well as metastasis and death may result from the tumor.	1.0998894792781455
Melanotic neuroectodermal tumor is most commonly treated by surgery.	0.813228535078433
10-15% of the lesions recur.	1.4852656111982223
We report the case of a 2-month-old infant suffering from melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy of the premaxilla who was successfully treated with a combination of various chemotherapeutic agents in order to spare the child a mutilating operation or the late effects of radiation.	1.005345568279925
Computer-assisted techniques were introduced in spine surgery in the 1990s to improve accuracy and safety of operative procedures.	1.0498918341467476
Several reports on clinical results of computer-aided screw insertion in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine as well as the sacro-iliac joints are available.	1.2186281408684263
They show a significant decrease of screw malplacement rates as compared to conventional insertion techniques.	1.0275780854564365
Over the past years, antioxidants, and particularly vitamin E, have received considerable attention in the treatment of human diseases.	1.2154501626882857
In rheumatology, interest has been given to the treatment and prevention of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.	1.1433606035144488
However, the concept of using antioxidant nutrients as potential remedies is not new.	0.9354028093412868
As early as the sixties, first case reports have described beneficial effects of vitamin E in the therapy of osteoarthritis.	0.9919295883999292
Nonetheless, most of the following studies were not conducted properly, thus, not allowing valid inferences about the efficacy of vitamin E. Newer studies with sound methodology have shown a beneficial effect in rheumatic diseases, mainly in the reduction of pain.	1.2291186087770896
This paper reviews current and past studies about vitamin E in the treatment of rheumatic diseases.	1.0081590302928192
Patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (i.v.-PCA) represents the gold standard in the management of acute postoperative pain.	0.9434574783295677
However, in many countries i.v.-PCA is rarely used.	1.2433625102261974
Recent clinical studies demonstrated that intranasal fentanyl titration provides a rapid and safe form and pain management.	0.9502031984858001
In the present study we investigated patients' acceptance and assessment of patient-controlled intranasal analgesia (PCINA) and compared it to intravenous PCA and the customarily prescribed pain therapy.	1.0828141033509802
Unreamed nailing with solid tibial nails is an accepted method of treatment for open tibial shaft fractures up to grade III and of closed tibial fractures with severe soft tissue damage.	1.0055240747032346
However, fatigue failure of the distal locking bolts is a frequent complication.	1.534648380202743
We report a mechanical study investigating the fatigue limit of six different types of locking bolts used in solid tibial nails (Biorigid Tibial nail/aap, UTN/ace, STN/Howmedica, TLN/Howmedica, R & T Tibial nail/Smith & Nephew, AO/ASIF UTN/Synthes).	0.9053204754463202
Our results prove a direct correlation between the bolt's diameter and mechanical properties.	0.8719556069731664
Further more we found that bolts with a continuing thread were weaker than bolts of the same diameter with only a short thread and an increased diameter at the nail's aperture.	1.0479489012836185
Our results suggest that mobilization with half of the average body weight (350N) allows osseous consolidation without fatigue failure of any of the tested locking bolts.	0.9352423680257071
Some of the tested locking bolts may even withstand full weight-bearing in a physiological walking cycle, but will not withstand the stress of a running cycle.	0.9843319475695346
Voiding dysfunctions secondary to failure of adequate relaxation of the striated urinary sphincter or the smooth bladder neck should be considered in children with urinary day time incontinence and/or enuresis and recurrent urinary tract infections.	1.0089335025741215
The urodynamic findings resemble to those obtained in neuropathic bladders, but only a minority of the children suffer from neurologic disorders or anatomical obstruction.	1.1132698237252963
In the majority of cases a developmental delay of the central nervous system responsible for urinary control is assumed.	0.9750203675711149
Behavioural disturbances play another important etiological role.	0.6118051787861042
Therapy is based on behavioural modification.	0.5415146410202849
We report on two patients with granulomatous rosacea and another patient with granulomatous perioral dermatitis who responded well to dapsone.	0.949812888169115
Dapsone has a pharmacological double function as both an antibiotic and an antiphlogistic drug.	0.8481321516449222
Before the introduction of isotretinoin, dapsone had its place in the treatment of severe acne.	0.9800669351712368
To date, its use in granulomatous rosacea has not been described.	1.079394810529134
When hematologic parameters are monitored, dapsone is considered a safe and cost-effective drug, especially in countries where isotretinoin is not readily available.	1.1224504428452766
However, the definite value of dapsone in granulomatous rosacea should be established by a controlled study.	0.9786703963960526
Anaesthesia both for adenotomy (AT) and for tonsillectomy (TE) frequently presents a challenge.	1.1078917261049
On one hand, children scheduled for adenotomy often have upper airway infections and are thus at risk of laryngo- and bronchospasm; on the other hand the ENT surgeon and the anaesthetist have to share the "workspace" in the patient's mouth.	1.2618998379875355
Since the succinyl choline debate in the early 1990s, the question of the best muscle relaxant has gone hand in hand with that of the most appropriate means of securing the airway.	1.1259358241849384
The concept of the laryngeal mask as airway was initially greeted with scepticism.	0.8648963369741453
Following several years' use of the mask for this purpose in AT and TE in young children, we report our experience and summarise the literature on this topic.	1.2038771323732191
The laryngeal mask represents a safe alternative to intubation, provided there is close cooperation with the ENT surgeon.	1.0525903881792884
Topical corticosteroids (CS) are frequently used to treat of allergic contact dermatitis, so that their own potential for sensitization is rarely detected.	1.1294774007530681
However, increasing numbers of hypersensitivity reactions to corticosteroids have been reported during the last 10 years, and allergic skin reactions to over 50 particular compounds have been observed.	1.2990213747648105
CS must now be regarded as a rather frequent contact allergen, the prevalence being twice as high in women as in men.	1.1090385844997424
Contact allergy to CS is clinically characterized by a chronic and persistent, corticosteroid-resistant dermatitis.	0.8856981098299945
In general, hypersensitivity to CS is a type I and/or type IV mediated allergic reaction.	0.9231782599363647
Cross-sensitivity between individual corticosteroid preparations has been described owing to their closely related chemical structures (e.g.	0.7943568184959172
hydrocortisone and tixocortol pivalate).	0.46444570852355543
Contact allergy to CS can be confirmed by patch-tests, intradermal injection tests or application tests; because of the delayed appearance of positive skin reactions a prolonged evaluation period of up to 120 h is recommended.	0.9041202162994336
For routine screening the use of the patient's own material and of tixocortol pivalate and budesonide as test marker substances seems appropriate.	1.0242729861455007
The development of further marker substances is a target for ongoing research.	0.8825965281498921
The alliance concepts are defined as being the description of the dynamic interaction of all cognitive and emotional factors which promote the analytic process.	0.9963604216996754
The historical significance and the development of the three predominant alliance concepts, these being the implicit "standard alliance" of Freud, Zetzel's therapeutic alliance and Greenson's working alliance, are to be described.	1.0998908832193535
All alliance concepts refer to a general, essentially reality-oriented relationship anchored in the personal and the human domain, which forms the background for the therapeutic process and the basis for the analytic interpretation work.	1.1606997692300887
Nonetheless, the dynamic force of the alliances is substantiated by factors of the transference.	1.1168752938261775
The alliances are therefore not faced with the transference, but rather with the resistance.	1.0966678077811751
We report on a 15-months-old girl with a history of recurrent phlegmones of the lower eyelid, dacryocystitides, conjunctivities and mucositis together with growth-retardation, chronic obstipation and anal prolaps.	1.054909288229658
During a period of 19 days absolute neutropenia was observed.	0.7782466745171347
Retrospectively, neutrophil counts were between 0-500/µl from birth on.	0.857610236481007
Bone marrow biopsy revealed an arrest of maturation of granulopoiesis at the stage of promyelocytes.	0.8667514973430068
Continuous therapy with 10  µg/kg/d of recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) induced 12-day oscillations of blood neutrophil counts.	1.0973975153288127
There were no oscillations of counts of other blood cell lines.	1.0098483913198353
Growth retardation and prolaps of anus normalized, and few intercurrent bacterial infections, pneumonia and impetigo contagiosa occurred.	0.8586975829297576
A mutation in the G-CSF-receptor gene was not found in this patient.	1.0427447434051735
After 2 years of therapy, a reduction of rhG-CSF dose (application every 2 days) lead to a severe neutropenia.	1.0154278257545943
We report a 31-year-old renal transplant patient treated with cyclosporin A who developed an unusual sebaceous gland hyperplasia accompanied by a disseminated follicular spiny hyperkeratosis.	1.1258059191990173
Those alterations were most evident on his face and limbs.	0.7410222125571259
In some locations hairy hyperkeratosis with authentic hair neogenesis was found.	0.5996214176195654
The histology of these alterations showed a marked hyperkeratosis of the hair follicles with formation of hair-like spikes either alone or in connection with hairs.	1.0724094144817253
The presence of true hairs distinguishes our case from the morphologically similar disseminated spiked hyperkeratosis and other spiny keratinization disorders.	0.80944304089754
Scanning electron microscopy helped to demonstrate the hair-like structure of these keratoses.	0.8950058317934084
Some of the sebaceous glands showed cystic widening of their lumina, which were filled with abundant amorphous eosinophilic material, a finding similar to earlier observations.	1.077028091919256
Our case demonstrates that these skin alterations should be classified as side effects of cyclosporin A and that they are apparently dose-dependent.	0.9080408751074747
Background: Since increased intraoperative iris irritation can lead to increased postoperative inflammation, we are interested in postoperative reactions to several varied surgical procedures.	1.141213457790167
We performed pupil stretching, iridotomy with iris suture, and partial sphincterectomy.	0.9325765202990163
Reports of accidental alkaloid-intoxications with plants of the nightshade family, in  particular Datura-species are well known in pediatric care.	0.938525715861793
The intentional abuse as a hallucinogenic drug in adolescents became more frequent in recent years.	0.8167825727534014
Two patients, a 14- resp.	0.9406216248916571
16-year old boy were admitted to the intensive care units of our hospitals  because of a severe central anticholinergic syndrome after ingestion of tea from Angel's Trumpet blossoms for experimental reasons.	1.119779370526928
Patient's history in the first somnolent patient was not available at the time of admission, a routine immunological drug screening of the patient's urine had been negative.	1.2642366841918053
In the present case of a granular cell tumor an abdomino-thoracal resection of the esophagus was performed in a 41-year-old patient after preoperative diagnosis had suggested esophageal cancer.	1.2652500148034802
Granular cell tumors (Abrikossoff's tumor) of the esophagus are rather rare tumors of neuroectodermal benign histogenesis.	1.0920753515574715
Diagnosis can be obtained by endoscopic and histological study and immunohistochemical forceps biopsy.	0.9663505869853789
Because of the peculiar histological feature of the tumor, it can be mistaken for an squamous cell carcinoma.	0.9748082231246339
In the guidelines for determination of the blood alcohol level for forensic purposes, a correction factor of 1.2 has been established for the conversion of serum alcohol into blood alcohol based on the relationship of the water content between serum and whole blood.	1.260221453470991
The reliability of the determination of the blood alcohol level is dependent on the possible minimum and maximum values of this correction factor.	0.9400830024398336
In a comprehensive multicenter study consisting of 833 samples, which can be considered representative of persons involved in offences under the drinking and driving act, an average quotient of 1.16 was found with minimum and maximum values of 1.08 and 1.21 respectively.	1.1132098320330166
In 96% of the cases the quotient was between 1.13 and 1.19 and the deviation of the quotient from the average value was less than 3%.	1.1826889074420746
From these results it can be assumed that the determination of blood alcohol is obviously more reliable than previously presumed.	1.0664720328566035
In Germany, if the dermatologist has definite proof that a patient's skin disorder is severe or chronic, work-related and requiring a change in occupation, then he or she must issue a Berufskrankheitenanzeige (loosely translated as occupational disease notification).	1.0299518204945823
The patient's consent is not required for this mandatory form, which has to be submitted even if the patient is opposed.	1.2780116760425515
On the other hand, if there is only a possible connection between the occupation and the skin disorder, or if the skin disease is neither severe nor chronic nor threatening pursuit of the occupation, then the dermatologist needs only write a Hautarztbericht (dermatologist's report).	1.0821723813564808
The patient's permission is required for this less formal document.	1.0354723498333167
Bone marrow involvement is often observed in patients with hematological malignancies and solid tumors.	0.9280903389198907
Sensitive immunological and molecular biological methods allow the detection of isolated transformed cells in bone marrow samples.	0.8498243030354993
Like normal hematopoietic cells, tumor cells interact with bone marrow stroma through adhesion molecules.	0.9030658446828554
Since adhesion mulecules play an essential role in the invasion and proliferation of malignant cells, new therapeutic approaches involving the inhibition of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions are conceivable.	0.9494138936869551
With the development of powerful computer systems, computer-assisted medical diagnosis and therapy have become common over the last 10 years.	1.011615721100351
Even in the surgical field, computer- and robotic-assisted techniques are becoming practical but are not yet used on a daily basis.	1.0392967229770158
In the orthopaedic field, computer and robotic assistance is used in planning and performing demanding three-dimensional osteotomies, setting pedicle screws in the spine and milling the femoral medullary canal in total hip replacement.	1.0005729069613138
This article introduces a computer- and robotic-assisted system for performing arthroplasty in total knee replacement procedures.	0.9130208197254145
The hand is very exposed to injuries in the daily man's work.	0.9505502608729754
The multiple functions of the hand are based on vitality, sensibility, motor function and stability.	0.9797411856800968
In severe hand injuries the functional results of the repair are often very poor.	1.071035930843007
In a complex injury of the hand we are faced with the damage of the soft tissue and bone and the loss of vitality and function of the hand.	1.027824673370582
The cause of hand injuries are mainly a crush trauma or the rotating saw.	0.8689437542382739
Basically, we recommend an extended primary repair.	1.3216489898147303
After the radical debridement we have to reconstruct the damaged structures.	0.8281344553271827
We start doing the osteosynthesis and stabilization of the joints.	0.8760942348072618
Thereafter, suturing of extensor and flexor tendons.	0.8027431321857146
Then, we do the microsurgical reconstructions of vessels and nerves.	1.0269023765359706
In case tendons and bones are exposed we have to cover the defect with a pedicled or a free flap.	0.9415100977798018
In a long ischemic time we have to change our concept and do the reconstruction of the vessels first.	1.1162846775400688
Our results in vitality and sensibility are listed.	0.63415063457566
In the result of a complex hand injury each single functional restoration is very important.	1.0124093053561902
Therefore, it is necessary that severe hand injuries are treated at well established centres for hand surgery.	1.1671071128049406
A 34-year-old women had a hen's egg-sized supernumerary mammary gland with no nipple or areola in the left anterior axillary line for the last 8 years.	0.9731690935008639
The main complaint about the axillary "lump" was that it was aesthetically displeasing, and it was excised.	1.160223802037729
The importance of an axillary breast lies in the possibility that pathologic changes could develop in its substance and that clinically it could be confused with a lipoma.	0.9845144213441281
Early diagnosis and correct excision are usually recommended.	0.7789901928348728
Paclitaxel and docetaxel are potent drugs that are effective in the treatment of malignant tumors.	0.9080709036291594
The cytotoxic action of these drugs is not fully understood, but it appears to be mediated mainly through mitotic arrest and subsequent apoptosis.	1.126700111883804
Because no information is available on the antiangiogenesis action of docetaxel, the investigations were performed to determine whether inhibition of neoangiogenesis plays a role in docetaxel's antitumor efficacy.	1.1023182229387194
Four different mouse tumors, two squamous cell carcinomas (SCC-IV; SCC-VII) and two adenocarcinomas (MCA-4; MCA-29) were assayed for angiogenic activity using the in vivo i.c.	1.0366485843481226
Tumor cells (5 x 105) were injected i.c.	1.190869500308984
into the skin flap over the abdominal wall, and the number of new blood vessels at the tumor cell injection site was determined 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 days later.	1.2153606201896223
The mice were treated with docetaxel (Taxotere - 31.3 mg/kg i.v.)	0.9692922106039469
1 or 4 days after tumor cell injection.	0.8854771706956622
The number of new blood vessels increased with time.	0.7582848321362428
Docetaxel reduced the number of newly formed blood vessels in MCAs, but not in SCCs.	1.2188912319102654
The reduction was associated with slower tumor growth.	0.6329123359165066
In a separate set of experiments we observed that docetaxel's inhibitory effect on the two MCAs was histologically associated with massive tumor cell destruction by means of both apoptosis and necrosis.	0.9592690523557271
This was not observed for the two SCCs.	1.1483175228574092
Since no reduction in blood vessels occurred in tumors unresponsive to docetaxel, the inhibition of neoangiogenesis in docetaxel-responsive tumors was likely the result of a decrease in angiogenic stimuli due to docetaxel's destruction of tumor cells.	0.9857943325427547
A patient on long term parenteral nutrition developed acrodermatitis enteropathica-like skin changes.	0.7649375097583934
Just as in the autosomal recessive disorder, acrodermatitis enteropathica, the lesions in our patient were caused by zinc deficiency.	1.0720709257083532
Replacement therapy with zinc led to rapid improvement.	0.6598665991410747
A measurement system was developed that permits objective comparisons of the sound conduction of middle ear implants.	0.8712693595575015
The implants are fitted into a mechanical middle ear model which approximates the impedances of the eardrum and the inner ear.	0.7931173838463033
A defined signal within the frequency range of 0-5 kHz is provided by a miniaturized loudspeaker at the input to the model and is  measured by a probe microphone.	1.0488312897284755
Displacement of an artificial stapes footplate at the output of the model is measured by a fiberoptic probe with a sensitivity of 5 nm.	0.9147886312949491
The transmission function is calculated as the quotient of the output and the input signal.	0.8689049449984886
This system can be used to evaluate the sound-transmitting properties of different middle ear implants excepting other influences, such as surgical techniques.	1.032601834085531
This work details the measurement system and demonstrates basic influences on the sound-transmission of middle ear implants.	0.8434615412295964
In acute myocardial infarction intracoronary stenting is superior to PTCA regarding interventional success and occurrence of cardiac events.	0.7341860493993891
It is, however, uncertain whether myocardial function also improves with stenting.	0.9211533607799733
We, therefore, assessed angiographic parameters of myocardial function in patients with acute myocardial infarction who were treated with primary PTCA and received additional stenting in case of an unsatisfactory angiographic result (provisional stenting).	1.2152051791936371
In order to perform accurate low-flow anaesthesia ventilation, it is desirable to avoid the influence of fresh gas flow (FGF) and inspiration duration (ID) on the resulting minute volume (MV).	1.2107118783052624
The Sulla 808V anaesthesia ventilator (Draeger, Luebeck, Germany) is originally not equipped with a fresh-gas decoupling (FGD) device.	0.937959725094755
Therefore, changes of FGF and ID settings applied during controlled ventilation may lead to alterations of the resulting MV.	1.1090432862758075
Recently, a low-cost FGD device (Carbamed, Bern-Liebefeld, Switzerland) has been developed, which can be inserted into the circle system.	0.9849660974891178
We investigated the effect of this device on MV in the Sulla 808V anaesthesia apparatus.	0.8985639288066402
Background: In a multicenter study the association of psychosocial stress and the use of psychosocial support in patients with diabetes mellitus was evaluated.	1.1404917554395821
The diagnosis Prader-Willi-Syndrome (PWS) in the neonate is difficult because features like neonatal hypotonia and feeding problems are easily misdiagnosed as a consequence of peripartal asphyxia.	1.0037288203332515
Craniofacial abnormalities like narrow bifrontal diameter, almond shaped palpebral fissures and openend downturned mouth are underdiagnosed especially if respiratory treatment is necessary.	0.7174821305814194
Hypogonadism in girls and in milder expression in boys (for example cryptorchism) are common and unspecific signs at that age.	1.049759134198424
Typical features like obesity and hyperphagia, small hands and feet and small stature are not expressed until the second year.	0.9791603206831481
The clinical course of PWS in the neonate is demonstrated in two cases.	0.995959756902265
Diagnostic criteria and therapeutic intervention are discussed.	0.8540544831285264
Hydrops fetalis as a seldom feature in PWS has to be taken into consideration.	0.6645875603574705
Diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) are an instrument for classification of inpatient cases.	1.1116428740293927
DRGs are finding ever broader implementation internationally.	0.4948951333771368
Targets for using DRGs are hospital financing and budgeting, cost accounting and quality assurance.	0.8562275056681949
The present survey covering 18 countries shows that so far DRGs are most frequently used for budgeting purposes.	0.971870737051872
In addition to DRG-based reimbursement, further quality assurance is necessary, but this is only being implemented with hesitation.	1.1600504748279903
The coverage planned for all inpatient cases through DRG-based reimbursement in Germany from 2003 on is a pioneering challenge internationally.	0.8717826523754141
Background: By law, applicants for driver's licenses not only have to have sufficient vision, but also have to use this sight reliably.	1.159119116746351
The nystagmus patient takes advantage of ocularly induced head turns and other forms of compensation.	0.7330453605789056

Sinde the introduction of the bladder drainage technique, the number of pancreas transplants performed has now reached 1000/year worldwide.	0.9976711573334827
Most of these transplants have been performed in the United States.	0.9155927854868988
In contrast, the number of pancreas transplants performed in the Eurotransplant community has remained at a low level for several years.	0.9509576710893418
The results of a consecutive series of 20 simultaneous pancreas/kidney grafts (SPK) performed between June 1994 and October 1995 demonstrate that high graft function rates of 83.5 % for pancreas and kidney grafts can be achieved.	1.120609337085497
Therefore SPK can be recommended as a standard procedure for patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease in Germany, too.	1.0226715412784508
Intubation and Positive End Expiratory Pressure Ventilation (PEEP) is a well established therapeutic strategy for impaired lung function, particularly following blunt chest trauma.	1.1036255084117812
Complications of this regime are however also well known and pose the question why non-invasive forms of respiratory assistance such as Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) have only gained minor popularity.	1.0605759791306049
In a prospective study, 30 patients who had suffered blunt chest trauma were treated with CPAP administered by mask.	1.0899350941128065
The regime consisted of continuous administration of CPAP by a face-mask, with gradually increasing periods of spontaneous breathing.	0.9576032436983056
Initially a FiO2 of 0.33 (range 0,28-0,38) proved necessary.	1.172874785372616
The initial CPAP level was 7 mbar (range 5-8) with an (Assisted Spontaneous Breathing) ASB of 15 mbar (range 13-18).	1.2345916963826535
FiO2 and CPAP/ASB levels were subsequently gradually reduced until no longer necessary.	0.7632942379409161
In all patients intubation and ventilation was avoided by this regimen.	1.0331682004008786
The treatment was well accepted by all patients and common ventilation associated complications such as pneumonia did not occur.	0.9284836773209154
In comparison with the former standard method of treatment the average ICU stay was dramatically reduced, principally due to not having to gradually wean patients from ventilation and sedation.	1.0145180798262357
Other positive benefits include normal communication and feeding with active early mobilisation leading to faster recovery, both physical and psychological.	0.9492378094697961
We conclude that non-invasive respiratory techniques should be used more frequently and recommend further studies are undertaken to define the indications.	1.093975415121668
Abstract:  Clinical findings and the correct assessment of the morphology and degree of stenosis is a decidant point in the conservative and operative therapy of carotid stenosis.	1.1306622229013081
Diagnosis should be reached fast, sure and cost-effective with a high sensitivity and specifity.	1.0504186478088038
Current methods for articular cartilage repair are unpredictable with respect to clinical success.	0.8953005956486207
In the present study, we investigated the ability of cells from articular cartilage, perichondrium, and costochondral resting zone to form new cartilage when loaded onto biodegradable scaffolds and implanted into calf muscle pouches of nu/nu mice.	0.9876765166453121
Prior in vitro studies showed that platelet derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), but not transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-1), basic fibroblast growth factor, or bone morphogenetic protein-2 promoted proliferation and extracellular matrix sulfation of resting zone chondrocytes without causing the cells to exhibit a hypertrophic chondrocyte phenotype.	1.1596683511172625
TGF-1 has also been shown to stimulate chondrogenesis by multipotent chondroprogenitor cells like those in the perichondrium.	0.9314102790252093
In addition, PDGF-BB has been shown to modulate chondrogensis by resting zone cells implanted in poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) scaffolds.	1.1056238112249772
In the present study we examined whether the cartilage formation is dependent on state of chondrocyte maturation and whether the pretreatment of chondrocytes with growth factors has an influence on the cartilage formation.	1.1121689144084395
Scaffolds were manufactured from 80 % PLG with a 75:25 lactide:glycolide ratio and 20 % modified PLG with a 50:50 lactide:glycolide ratio (PLG-H scaffolds).	1.0898497416527313
For each experimental group, four nude mice received two identical implants, one in each calf muscle resulting in an N = 8 implants: PLG-H scaffolds alone; PLG-H scaffolds with cells derived from either the femoral articular cartilage, costochondral periochondrium, or costochondral resting zone cartilage of 125 g male Sprague-Dawley rats; PLG-H scaffolds with either articular chondrocytes or resting zone chondrocytes that were pretreated with 37,5 ng/ml rhPDGF-BB for 4 h or 24 h before implantation, or with perichondrial cells treated with PDGF-BB plus 0,22 ng/ml rhTGF-1 for 4 h and 24 h. At 4 or 8 weeks after implantation, samples were harvested and analyzed histomorphometrically for new cartilage formed, area of residual implant and area of fibrous connective tissue.	0.9986116835801689
Only resting zone cells showed the ability to form new cartilage at a heterotopic site in this study.	0.958526294253858
There was no neocartilage found in nude mice with implants loaded with either articular chondrocytes or perichondrial cells.	0.766830138430179
Pretreatment of resting zone chondrocytes for 4 h prior to implantation significantly increased the amount of newly formed cartilage after 8 weeks and suppressed chondrocyte hypertrophy.	0.9600259148480739
The amount of fibrous connective tissue around implants containing either articular chondrocytes or perichondrial cells decreased with time, whereas the amount of fibrous connective tissue around implants containing resting zone chondrocytes pretreated with PDGF-BB was increased.	0.7994563442657253
The results showed that resting zone cells can be successfully incorporated into biodegradable porous PLG scaffolds and can induce new cartilage formation in a non-weight-bearing site.	0.9262986207264644
Articular chondrocytes as well as perichondrial cells did not have the capacity for neochondrogenesis when implanted heterotopically in this model.	0.9043685323410218
Bone tumors represent a group of tumors of various dignity.	0.8317245741408908
In spite of this single tumor entities may display strong morphological resemblance to each other which can in turn result in profound difficulties in differential diagnosis.	0.8704600486074612
The biological behaviour of a tumor is mainly determined by its rate of proliferation.	1.086357677370434
In this study the rate of proliferation of 64 bone tumors (30 high-grade central osteosarcomas, 6 low-grade osteosarcomas, 8 giant cell tumors, 8 aneurysmatic bone cysts, 5 osteoidosteomas/osteoblastomas, 7 fibrous dysplasias and 5 cases of a myositis ossificans) were analysed.	1.3133298470014099
Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue sections using the MIB-1 monoclonal antibody.	1.0088296858183985
MIB-1 recognizes the proliferation-associated Ki-67 protein which is expressed during the active phases of the cell cycle but cannot be detected in senescent cells.	0.9771023894270784
Among high-grade central osteosarcomas a significantly higher rate of proliferation (average value 30 %) was found in comparison with low-grade osteosarcomas and other benign intraosseous bone tumors.	1.3258468635326637
This approach proved to be very useful in the distinction between high-grade and low-grade osteosarcomas as well as bone-forming intraosseous tumors.	1.2283138625816812
However distinguishing low-grade osteosarcomas from benign bone tumors by determining only the rate of proliferation was not possible, although interestingly, the proliferative rate of myositis ossificans, a purely reactive lesion, was in the range of the values determined for high-grade osteosarcoma.	1.2698360831165938
Over the past century numerous graft materials have been used for the reconstruction of the cruciate ligament of the knee.	0.9818618371183317
Among the autologous tissues that are currently recommended as graft materials, the central bone patellar tendon bone graft, a quadrupled hamstring graft and the central quadriceps tendon graft have the greatest clinical significance.	1.032726782132002
With some limitations, allograft materials can also be used.	0.7804957180514855
Each of the three mentioned grafts has specific features regarding morphological and structural properties, graft fixation and graft incorporation.	0.9454637457884086
Clinical studies have failed to identify any of the three grafts as superior to the others.	1.0191482353983476
When choosing the graft for surgery the different anatomy and function of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments have to be considered.	0.9625359001059364
For the treatment of multiple ligament injuries and for revision cases, thorough preoperative planning is necessary and modified graft selection may be required.	1.066693729779875
Myasthenic crisis is a lifethreatening complication of myasthenia gravis due to respiratory failure and inability to swallow and cough up secretions.	0.8555119261083127
Frequent causes are intercurrent infections, fluctuations due to the natural history of the disease and insufficient immunosuppressive treatment prior to the crisis.	1.0444134321093685
Early referral to an experienced neurologist is essential.	0.6701542896565084
Specific therapy consists of symptomatic treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors, crisis management with plasmapheresis or immunoglobulins and immunosuppression with clucocorticoids.	0.8031911615573794
Infections must be treated vigorously.	0.5927506719035168
Thymectomy in patients with previously unrecognized myasthenia gravis is never urgently indicated and should be postponed until the patient is stabilized.	0.9668290415855565
In cases of impending respiratory failure and severe swallowing difficulties, early and elective admission to a specialized neurological intensive care unit and elective intubation should be performed.	1.056704988798663
Adequate nursing care of intubated patients and a set of prophylactic measures are essential to avoid complications adversely affecting prognosis.	0.930911918869109
Whenever it can be achieved, the best therapy of myasthenic crisis is its prevention by appropriate long-term management and follow-up of patients with myasthenia gravis.	1.3025827683838869
In a retrospective analysis we evaluated 48 patients who had been arthroscopically treated for tendinitis calcarea.	1.0483646766959958
The calcific deposit was removed whenever possible and all patients were treated by arthroscopic subacromial decompression.	1.123609499716304
In subjects who showed subacromial stenosis by X-ray or by intraoperative findings, an arthroscopic acromioplasty was performed.	1.007897165942957
At follow-up all patients were evaluated according to the Constant score.	1.0450344340250086
Additionally all pre- and postoperative X-rays were reviewed.	1.0916392102623331
After surgery the Constant score significantly improved.	0.8017849920676657
In all cases where acromioplasty was performed, a flattening of the bony configuration was achieved.	1.0482186962406945
The X-ray analysis showed that no calcific deposit with blurred borders converted to sharp borders.	0.7960034522493787
There was also no deposit that converted from a transparent appearance to a dense structure.	0.8855208283407279
Patients with disappearance of the calcific deposit postoperatively had significantly better outcome than patients with no change in the X-ray.	0.8162165221506975
An additional acromioplasty did not improve the results.	0.5616334483802509
The aim of arthroscopic treatment of calcific tendinitis has to be the removal of the calcific deposit.	1.3413179922325815
Acromioplasty does not lead to further improvement of the result.	0.9457643957610273
Preventive strategies aim to reduce gastric acidity (H2ms (sucralfate, antacids, pirenzepine) and to normalize gastric mucosal microcirculation (sucralfate, pirenzepine).	0.9468136256130418
Thus, the most important prophylactic measure is an optimized emergency and ICU regime aiming to improve oxygenation and microcirculation.	1.1066893701494778
All specific drugs used for stress ulcer prophylaxis have been shown to be effective in prospective controlled studies.	0.8920925948866234
Furthermore, pirenzepine has been found to be superior to H2-antagonists, at least in neurosurgical patients.	1.0945996618196887
Insufficient or no data exist to support the use of prostaglandins or omeprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis.	0.8010454129750164
The most important adverse effect of stress ulcer prophylaxis is nosocomial pneumonia due to gastric alkalinization.	0.9136792334413206
This may occur in long-term ventilated patients with a gastric pH>4 and may account for up to 50% of all nosocomial pneumonias in certain groups of patients.	1.119888592780314
Mortality is not influenced by antacids or H2-antagonists, while sucralfate has been shown to reduce mortality, most probably by inhibition of bacterial translocation.	1.0365331688309707
Three years after heart transplantation and immunosuppressive therapy, a 66-year-old man suffered from dyspnea and showed symptoms mainly due to right heart failure.	0.8876025114577746
Malignant tumor cells were discovered within extensive pleural effusion.	0.8461489144393413
Computed tomography revealed two lesions of the liver suspicious of metastases, and recurrent blood in the stools was evident.	1.074633044105638
The patient deteriorated rapidly and died 3 weeks after admission.	0.7741805807293695
Autopsy findings included an adenocarcinoma of the cecum (grade II) with metastases to the liver.	1.252328364737402
High-grade immunoblastic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of plasmoblastic differentiation was diagnosed, located within the mediastinal soft tissue and infiltrating the peri- and myocardium.	0.9402860191959244
Mesenteric lymph nodes were enlarged with histological verification of malignant lymphoma.	0.812664691383953
The lymphatic tumor masses had caused considerable compression of the heart and vessels, leading to the signs of cardiac failure.	0.9935127277933951
The development of metastasizing colonic carcinoma and high-grade immunoblastic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 3 years after heart transplantation and immunosuppressive therapy must be considered an unusual combination.	0.9676365490381875
Malignant lymphomas following heart transplantation have been described several times.	0.919859148328462
Infection rates are important markers for clinical quality assurance.	0.7853595756668141
For internal control, they may only be used under the condition of homogeneous data collection and evaluation according to identical standard operating procedures during the entire investigation period.	0.9571005183095692
For inter-hospital comparison, they may only be used if additionally the observed patient groups are well defined and comparable.	0.9756134392976318
A survey of the infection rates published during the last 6 years in the German traumatological literature (n = 71) indeed shows (concerning series later than 1985) similar infection rates for procedures in less and in more problematic anatomical regions and in clean and contaminated situations of about 2 - 3%, after open injuries sporadically max.	1.250330415143551
Finally, it is demonstrated that conclusions concerning a general "risk of infection" based on infection rates for specific surgical procedures are not possible and vice versa.	1.3143391839786331
We strongly recommend the future application of a standardized definition of wound infection.	0.9155626274521748
The differentiation between deep and superficial infection should be abandoned.	0.8181926220351965
For all mentioned "infection rates" it should be indicated whether it is with reference to the risk of infection of a specific procedure or only a general statement.	1.0775614423595776
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) are useful techniques for the objective documentation of the relation between the femoral head and the acetabulum after closed or open reduction of a developmental dislocation of the hip joint.	1.068493189369237
Before the ossification nucleus of the femoral head is sufficiently developed, MRI is preferred.	1.0529141877712933
For the evaluation of reduction from the 2nd year on, MRI and CT are equivalent.	1.080412019530404
However, in older children MRI may also be indicated for the evaluation of cartilaginous structures or the diagnosis of femoral head necrosis.	1.2642309992385794
CT in older patients may also be useful for 30 analysis of bony structures, e. g. for planning complex osteotomies.	0.9944210208225293
Careful diagnostic and early therapy are especially important in cases of scaphoid fractures.	0.9455444478969952
This is due to the patients being mostly young and the high number of non-unions of these carpal bones.	0.9793907769745206
Conservative and various operative treatments are therapeutical options.	0.7197888615984825
Out of the patients who underwent surgery from January 1993 to February 1999 42 patients with a scaphoid fracture and 88 patients with a scaphoid non-union were, in addition to standard X-ray examination, examined clinically and by MRI pre- and post-operatively.	1.2496491898930822
Fractures of the scaphoid were treated by Herbert screw fixtion.	1.01712115461388
When there is a possibility that tissue samples have been interchanged, DNA analysis of the histological specimens can be carried out to correctly assign the specimens to a patient.	1.0666577277034195
The use of polymerase chain reaction enables results to be obtained even from degraded DNA in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples.	0.7544488171816911
A review of 110 children with Burkitt's lymphoma admitted to the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu during a 7-year period revealed a preponderance of males over females (1.9 : 1) and a peak incidence at five years.	1.1761130603127348
The main sites affected initially by the tumour in order of frequency were the face and abdomen.	0.9786766913803623
The spinal column, spleen, and lungs were less affected.	1.078333806757764
It is postulated that an interaction between malarial and Epstein-Barr virus infections and malnutrition are important in the aetiology of the tumour.	0.9795912149090504
The most effective drug is cyclophosphamide.	0.9721136104001519
A combination of this drug with vincristine and methotrexate is equally effective in inducing remissions, but is better than the single agent in preventing systemic relapse.	1.1182438826847891
Follow-up of the patients revealed good survival.	1.5121040030982293
The consumption of the jet set drug Ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymetamphetamine, abbreviated to MDMA) by young people is increasing markedly.	1.131501652434581
Parallel to this developement, there is a large number of reports on severe neurological, psychiatric and medical complications following the use of Ecstasy.	1.0502260552343656
Seizures are among the most common clinical complications of the CNS following the ingestion of Ecstasy.	1.0428792092839136
The term "mild cognitive impairment" refers to cognitive deficits which exceed normal physiological aging processes, but do not fulfill the criteria for dementia.	0.9422221918937488
The prevalence rates of four current concepts were compared in a sample of 202 healthy 60-64 year-old participants recruited from the interdisciplinary longitudinal study on adult development and aging (ILSE).	1.0140401477668515
Furthermore, the relationships between cognitive deficits and psychological and sociodemographic variables were examined.	0.97387776571102
The following prevalence rates were determined: 13.5% for age-associated memory impairment, 6.5% for age-consistent memory impairment, 1.5% for late-life forgetfulness and 23.5% for aging-associated cognitive decline.	1.2571161667445667
Subjective cognitive complaints did not correlate with results obtained from neuropsychological tests.	0.9239032323132199
Significant correlations were however found between subjective cognitive complaints and higher scores on depression and neuroticism scales.	0.9268978462856595
Significant correlations were also found between a reduced test performance and a lower educational level and socioeconomic status.	1.067859578812265
Longitudinal studies are warranted to further elucidate the predictive value of these diagnostic concepts.	0.8655797254897151
In a retrospective study, we evaluated 180 patients treated for painful spondylolisthesis with combined anterior and posterior fusion.	1.1631660476078192
Group I included 90 patients treated by anterior fusion with the transperitoneal approach.	0.8830819428886684
Group II included 90 patients operated on with a retroperitoneal approach.	0.8094605627001957
Group II showed a higher incidence of pseudarthrosis L5/S1 (4 %), tear of the common iliac vein (1 %), postsympathectomy syndrome (4 %) and reversible L4 nerve-root lesion (3 %).	1.2033610996646953
On the basis of our findings, we recommend the transperitoneal approach for anterior interbody fusion L5 to S1 or L4 to S1.	0.97789456015362
Coronary surgery is at this point of time the standard therapy of unprotected left main coronary artery stenosis.	1.1679325329840926
Coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is performed only in bail out situations.	0.8304520720299245
The number of publications of successful percutaneous intervention in unprotected left main coronary stenosis is increasing because of increasing use of stents and ticlopidine to avoid stent-thrombosis.	0.9544204963206993
Within the context of an extensive study of electroconvulsive therapy at the Psychiatric Clinic of the University of Bonn 15 patients suffering from therapy-resistent Major depression (DSM III-R) were examined with a detailed psychometric test battery, containing memory- and nonmemory tests.	1.1265678826789083
The test battery had been applied short time before, during and after the treatment with 10 ECT applied unilateral over the nondominant hemisphere.	1.040627487841348
Comparing the test performances before and 1-2 days after the end of the series there were only few remarkable changes: a significant decrease was diagnosed exclusively in 30 min delayed recall of verbal items, while visual short-term memory and visual-constructive performance showed a significant improvement (in spite of unilateral stimulation on the right side).	1.2732549999033074
None of the other cognitive functions inclusively speed of performances and reaction time was detracted short time after the end of the ECT-treatment, instead all the measures improved albeit not significantly.	1.0054056372032385
Between responders to treatment (50% improvement in HAMD) and non-responders no significant differences neither before nor after the treatment were detected.	1.1144798048406797
The non-responders had in nearly all of the tests some better (but not significantly) results despite being older than the group of responders.	1.0764765226307285
In this study we assessed the drawing abilities in 37 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria.	0.9736933375268351
Drawing abilities (drawing: house, flower, clock; Rey-Osterrieth figure; copying: MMST-figure; Rey-Osterrieth figure) were quantified with different rating schemes and related to other neuropsychological assessments.	0.8420835595961522
All patients underwent a positron emission tomography with 18-FDG.	1.1053845979812782
Drawing performance was highly correlated with severity of dementia - expressed in MMST scores (r=0.78; p<0.0001) - with visuo-spatial short-term memory (r=-0.69; p=0.001), and writing abilities (r=-0.77; p<0.0001).	1.0422002921954359
The summarized drawing score showed a statistically significant correlation with the rate of temporoparietal glucose metabolism measured with positron emission tomography and 18-FDG (r=0.39; p=0.017).	1.0062451839768176
In the drawings of AD patients omittings and simplifications were typical, whereas perseverations rarely occured.	0.922019476323857
In severely demented patients closing-in phenomenons could be de- scribed, too.	0.7386184286264985
A subgroup of AD patients with visuo-constructive impairment as the leading symptom could not be identified.	0.9273628132189978
Since the first dermatological outpatient clinic was started in Dresden in 1869, it has seen the practice of dermatology in the broadest sense, with scientific research activity and innovation.	1.1541123534242455
The good working relationship between the dermatologists in private practice and those in the clinics has been the main factor in this successful development.	1.0238317162658588
The traditional background of the following sectors is highlighted: outpatient clinic, X-ray and UV ligth treatment, allergology and occupational dermatology, psychosomatic dermatology, dermatosurgery, and phlebology.	1.01515162621216
A 12-year-old girl from Zaire with Aids (CDC: P2 D1) presented with a generalized molluscum contagiosum infection.	1.0057775307803012
She had suffered from systemic cryptococcosis and from cryptosporidiosis several months before admission.	0.697551329700859
While molluscum contagiosum infection is usually a self-limiting disease in immunocompetent persons, a fulminant appearance and persistence of giant mollusca occurs with advanced immunodeficiency.	0.9703876593920913
Histological and immunohistological examinations showed a severe diminution of Langerhans and T cell populations that might enhance the dissemination of the infection.	0.8711439097971272
Molluscum-like lesions of cryptococci have been described, and cutaneous cryptococcosis is the main condition to be considered in the differential diagnosis.	1.0744061701994236
Further differential diagnoses should include American and African histoplasmosis, and the cutaneous manifestations of mycobacterial infections, of toxoplasmosis and of Pneumocystis carinii infection.	1.0827323805950113
The search for vascular structures in skin tumors by incident light microscopy has revealed a surprisingly high proportion of vascularized tumours.	0.8201173434292802
Characteristic vascular patterns, in some cases highly tumour-specific, have been defined.	1.0728036013856803
The vascular structure is a valuable feature for characterization and differentiation of skin tumours, especially for amelanotic malignant melanoma.	1.1266426355591628
We propose a flowchart procedure for analysis and diagnosis of skin tumours using incident light microscopy, which appears to be valuable for advanced image analytic techniques.	0.9728702675062936
Introduction: The treatment of full-thickness cartilage defects still represents a problem that has not yet been solved satisfactorily.	1.1073059695179557
Current methods used to cover defects in the knee joint are osteochondral cylinder transplantation (OCT) and autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT).	0.9747149202299825
Methods: With a prospective clinical investigation, at the time being with 2-year results, we have examined ACT in comparison to OCT in 20 patients with regard to clinical and histomorphological (histology, immunohistochemistry, RES) outcome.	1.3954872392703424
Results: We found equally good results with both methods in Lysholm, Meyers and Tegner Activity Scores.	1.1326412586056394
Histomorphologic evaluation of biopsies obtained by arthroscopy after ACT showed a defect filling in all cases, mainly with fibrous cartilage, while localized areas of hyalinelike regenerative cartilage were documented near the base.We did not see any histomorphologically visible change in the transplants after OCT.	0.9690319542759203
Conclusion: At the time we prefer OCT instead of ACT given the correct indication.	1.1668244469597693
This case report intends to focus attention on hemodynamic TIAs as cause of repetitive involuntary movements (RIMs) as differential diagnosis of simple partial motor seizures.	1.0523794602204424
We report two patients with episodic unilateral limb shaking lasting up to several minutes and which could be triggered by orthostasis, heat or physical exertion.	0.945530762202586
Repeated EEG recordings revealed no epileptic discharges.	0.6326153861935443
In both patients, duplex ultrasonography revealed an occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) contralateral to the side of the RIMs.	0.8538236010387458
Blood flow velocities in the middle cerebral artery ipsilateral to ICA occlusion were reduced and vasomotor reactivity to hypercapnia was absent.	0.8645071228906885
After elevation of blood pressure both patients became asymptomatic.	0.9811283950790518
We suggest that in patients with episodes of RIMs, Doppler sonography and tests of cerebral vascular reserve capacity should be performed to search for a hemodynamic origin of these symptoms.	1.0712803025875564
Ethylene dichloride (EDC) is used as a solvent and in the rubber, plastic, and insecticide industry.	1.1177632377953535
The fatal adult dose is below 20 ml.	0.6453314643983045
Poisoning can occur from inhalation, ingestion or skin absorption.	0.7917720285315627
EDC depresses almost all cells, but essentially those of the central nervous system, liver, kidneys, and heart.	1.0428945327624715
Death is usually due to liver or central nervous failure.	0.8258120323384742
Retrospectively analyzing the history of three patients with gastrointesinal stromal tumors (GIST) treated over a period of 1 year in the surgical department of our regional hospital, we tried to answer the following questions: using the current recommendations in the literature, how are the macro- and microscopic features and clinical presentation to be interpreted?	1.1511747517974829
Which prognostic and therapeutic conclusions should we draw, giving special consideration to practice-orientated management of such cases.	0.9999993846346278
The patients were 65, 75 and 88 years old respectively, and in each case the GIST manifested as recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding.	1.298987394841652
During surgical treatment four gastric tumors ranging in cross section between 2.5 and 8 cm were found.	1.029441152969063
The GIST diagnosis was established after light microscopic and immunohistochemical examinations.	0.8258558118018703
Going through the current literature, a large number of structural and immunohistochemical criteria have come to light for determining its classification and potential malignancy.	1.0170135042125783
On the other hand, very few subsequent recommendations concerning therapy and prognosis can be found and follow-up recomendations are almost unavailable.	1.0456997230848328
We conclude that GISTs are difficult to diagnose because of their locality and that their clinical behavior is uncertain.	1.0587960222607355
The potential malignancy, on the other hand, requires a well-founded diagnostic procedure in the form of the best possible pre-therapeutic staging.	1.038362212031262
Furthermore, initially radical surgical treatment should be adopted and the follow-up should be adapted to the risk involved.	1.2035919266987387
The latter is arbitrary and further clinical studies are required.	0.9219766457267717
In animal experiments and clinical studies liquid ventilation with perfluorcarbons improves gas exchange and breathing mechanics in damaged lungs.	0.9893017178665916
According to the data on the toxicity of perfluorcarbons available today, it could potentially be applied in infants in the future, too.	1.2858660482218924
However, the catalogue of unanswered questions is still too long for controlled clinical phase III studies to be conducted.	0.9542068213036417
Further possible applications of liquid ventilation offer hope of solving open therapeutic and diagnostic problems.	0.8437784884075166
Taking into account all available data about liquid ventilation with perfluorcarbons today, we still do not know whether it is a real alternative method for respiratory support; however, further studies to investigate whether the method is an alternative strategy for artificial ventilation in neonates are justified.	1.2695797487766511
The role of elective lymph node dissection (ELND) in primary malignant melanoma is controversial.	0.9303610495998506
Our purpose was to evaluate the benefit of ELND regarding survival and disease-free survival in malignant melanoma of the trunk and extremities.	0.9905755448461249
By matched-pair analysis, 375 patients treated by wide local excision (WLE) plus ELND were compared to 375 patients treated by WLE only.	0.9915104659619647
There was no difference in survival between the two treatment groups; however, the disease-free interval was significantly higher in the collective treated by WLE plus ELND (P<0.05).	1.0438140875137771
Increased survival rates were noted for intermediate tumor thickness of 1.51-4.0 mm for the WLE+ELND group although the difference was not significant (P=0.14), and disease-free survival was significantly improved in this group (P<0.001).	1.184407353106567
ELND elicited a higher benefit in male patients with intermediate thickness melanoma.	0.8196544673634736
Our results confirm the findings of several studies that ELND improves the outcome after primary treament of malignant melanoma of intermediate tumor thickness.	1.021799206701793
7 patients (5 female, 2 male; age:  22-81 years; average age=58,1 J) with recurrent necrotizing ANCA-negative, non leucocytoclastic vasculitis, were enrolled into this study.	1.2314376179829862
Disease was resistant to prior conservative therapy, and therefore patients received high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) - (dose: 1,0 g/kg body weight daily dose 0,25 g/kg body weight over 4 consecutive days).	1.1479544962348294
All patients responded rapidly to this therapeutic regimen.	0.7334174619361138
Specifically immediate pain relief was striking.	0.6886572253888922
Complete clearance of disease was observed in 5 out of 7 patients within 6 months while receiving IVIG (0,5 g/kg body weight) every 4 weeks for one year.	1.1683793442687174
In 2 out of 5 patients ulceration and vasculitis healed completly and therapy could be stopped after 6 months.	0.8651346755579332
In one patient treatment had to be discontinued due to decreasing kidney function.	0.9393518213841803
The data presented demonstrate that IVIG is an  effective and valuable therapeutic modality in treatment of severe vasculitis resistant to conventional therapy.	0.9825406580569885
However consideration of costs, effectiveness and possible side effects is needed for this therapeutic regime.	1.0207028672646947
After orthopedic surgery, skeletal muscle will enter the rehabilitation process in weakened condition due to the following characteristics.	0.9779930854681647
After use of a tourniquet during surgery, the muscle suffers ischemia/reperfusion damage due to oxidative stress, resulting in structural impairment.	1.0403498843537815
The resulting immobilization leads to muscular atrophy, with a loss of calcium homeostasis and oxidative stress being of etiological significance.	0.9470420766059264
Degeneration of muscle fibers as well as regeneration occurs in muscle while still immobilized.	0.8417672118903634
After remobilization, the muscle has impaired functional capacity and frequently shows disturbances in its innervation pattern.	0.9986492997885589
High mechanical loading should therefore be avoided, and electrical stimulation may be applied to facilitate recovery.	1.0241764764539507
Considering the role of oxygen radicals, supplementation with vitamin E appears generally recommendable.	0.7591242821571418
The timing of surgery and postoperative radiotherapy - especially if combined with chemotherapy - has been a subject of interest over the past years.	1.4230700500035494
This analysis was based on a literature review of mostly retrospective publications.	0.9801566621727281
Data concerning the interval between surgery and radiotherapy were correlated with the locoregional control, incidence of distant metastases and prognosis of breast cancer, lung carcinoma, and head and neck carcinomas.	1.039679976094664
The reviewed data did not show a clear relationship of the time interval between surgery and start of radiotherapy and locoregional control.	0.9881255896581438
However, evaluation of the data was difficult, because in most publications, retrospective analyses were performed and other prognostically more relevant parameters may influence locoregional control stronger than the time interval.	1.2571367842737102
In patients with head and neck carcinomas, there is a negative effect of time interval between surgery and radiotherapy on local control if unfavorable factors exist, i. e., close surgical margins, unfavorable pathohistological parameters and low radiation dose.	1.0359738490482813
In patients with breast cancer who do not receive chemotherapy, there are inconsistent reports in the literature.	0.954305632578525
If additional chemotherapy is necessary, the sequence surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy seems adequate.	1.0042415411600496
Although some data suggest that delaying the initiation of radiotherapy due to chemotherapy may increase the risk or local recurrences, there may, on the other hand, be an increased likelihood of systemic metastases, if radiotherapy is applied before chemotherapy.	1.1387972574260723
Concerning lung cancer, only one retrospective analysis exists suggesting a better survival of patients with an interval of more than 36 days between surgery and radiotherapy as compared to patients with a shorter interval.	1.2354908892546652
The treatment of severely injured patients is a challenge for preclinical and clinical treatment concepts, causing financial aspects of increasing importance for the German health care system.	1.0713808424191178
A total of 32,500 polytraumatized patients (PTS III and IV) are managed in trauma center levels I-IV in Germany.	1.2173926320336437
Trauma center levels I or II are by definition capable of supporting the full range of treatment for the severely injured.	0.8663330498927663
With the baseline calculation of 64,000 DM per patient and 104 polytrauma treated per year in the Berlin Virchow Clinic, 6.66 million DM primary costs must be spent for treatment.	0.9729619501105978
The total annual costs of this center are nearly 24 million DM for emergency cases and 7 million DM fixed costs per year, for a trauma center level I.	0.9865078001581946
In Europe the distribution of trauma center levels I or II is sufficient and can be specified with 1 center per 1 million inhabitants.	0.864513764111637
Nevertheless, the european air medical service could support more intensive use of these central trauma institutions.	1.0307799746565474
This was shown by comparing the number of polytrauma patients and the number of trauma centers.	0.9582368072904623
Less then half of these patients are treated in levels I or II trauma centers.	1.1046071964232143
The financial pressure on the health system and the rising quality must lead to better utilization of trauma centers.	0.9053253972684354
To meet this goal a annual treatment rate of 300-400 polytrauma patients should be aimed at.	0.7718930108899209
The claim of the American College of Surgeons that a trauma surgeon should treat 50 severely injured patients per year would then be possible.	0.9529931656802794
This report is a retrospective investigation of the efficacy of bioenergetic therapies given to adults in a private practice setting and furthermore a study of the stability of the therapeutic results achieved.	1.0934759818983508
In the spring of 1997 a total of 16 bioenergetic therapists (6 of them medical doctors and 10 psychologists), all members of the Swiss Society of Bioenergetic Therapists (SGBAT), provided upon request a number of data on 319 patients who had terminated their therapies after a minimum of 20 sessions 6 months to 6 years earlier.	1.2064709511258502
A self-evaluating questionnaire was then constructed, to be answered anonymously, and was sent to these 319 patients in late summer 1997; 290 of them could be reached and 142 (49%) returned it.	1.1571438379228836
The questionnaire contained questions related to the psychic and physical condition, to interpersonal and psychosomatic problems, and to the effect of body work on physical consciousness, cognitive insights and changes of the quality of life.	1.211727774078564
Regarding the efficacy of bioenergetic therapies, the statistical analysis of the returned questionnaires showed significant positive changes in all areas questioned.	0.9593909644634707
Bioenergetic body work was judged to be important and indispensable by about half of the patients.	0.9770638584851902
Regarding the stability of the therapeutic result, 107 patients indicated a stable or even improved condition.	0.9233774605178086
Of the 35 patients who since termination of the bioenergetic therapy had chosen to undergo further therapy, 16 opted again for a body-oriented psychotherapy.	0.9694990422122785
Purpose: In a clinical study 35 patients with intracranial aneurysms were examined using CT-angiography, MR-angiography (MRA) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA).	1.2520003058474407
The aim of the study was to establish the ability of noninvasive techniques to detect intracranial aneurysms.	1.126867504053022
"Classic" choroidal neovascularization (CNV) has a relatively uniform appearance in fluorescein angiography.	1.0264663300539438
In contrast, indocyanine green (ICG) angiography shows variable features of well-defined CNV.	0.9935219335791642
We examined 31 classic CNV patients secondary to age-related macular degeneration using a confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscope (Heidelberg Retina Angiograph) in order to determine ICG characteristics of classic CNV.	0.9096600999102902
Vascular patterns (97%), a hypofluorescent rim (84%), a hyperfluorescent margin (42%), late ICG leakage (32%) and "feeder vessels" were identified in variable frequency.	1.2081155455445316
Some of the ICG characteristics may correlate with histological features of the membrane and reflect proliferative activity.	0.8926815184003216
Extrafoveal "feeder vessels" may be amenable to laser photocoagulation in the presence of subfoveal CNV.	0.8730096781339055
In situ polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR in situ hybridization are new diagnostic tools in dermatopathology.	0.8435808616175682
These techniques can combine the sensitivity of PCR with the advantage of in situ hybridization to localize specific cellular structures.	0.99271296883834
With optical control of the PCR reaction product in these techniques, false-positive results due to contamination can be minimized.	1.036225655980675
Several working protocols have been established which allow detection of DNA and RNA sequences in a rapid and reproducible manner.	0.9480265317793197
Two different methods have been established to detect the amplification product, the indirect PCR in situ hybridization (PCRisHyb), and the direct in situ PCR (is PCR).	1.2015060939172375
An easy and reproducible method for PCRisHyb and isPCR in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue is described and the two techniques are compared.	0.8430557391208888
Using both isPCR and PCRisHyb, the amplification product can be visualized with an optimal morphological preservation of the tissue.	0.963857717400462
Indirect PCRisHyb showed a slightly higher specificity whereas direct isPCR was the quicker, easier and less expensive method.	0.7904688020886494
In a randomized study 30 patients with chronic stationary psoriasis were treated with 3 different topical schemes.	1.1602129642634216
Group 1 (n=10) received monotherapy (dithranol (D) twice a day, D/D), group 2 (n=10) calcipotriol mornings/dithranol evenings (calcipotriol (C)/dithranol (D) C/D) and 3 (mometasone (M) mornings/dithranol (D) evenings, M/D).	1.0038051698170454
During the therapy period of 4 weeks we documented the PASI-Score as well as infiltration, erythema and desquamation weekly.	0.9806632092724225
The M/D group revealed in the first week a significantly faster reduction of the PASI-score (5,3) than in the D/D group (PASI 13,22).	1.2142469438043686
The C/D group (PASI 10,5) show a not significantly faster reduction.	0.9467521852298943
After 4 weeks of treatment and after a follow period of 6 weeks there were similar PASI-Scores in all groups.	1.1830274729661128
There were less side-effects in the M/D group than in the others.	1.1090163890779776
The beginning, more anti-psoriatic effectiveness was achieved by the mometasone/dithranol combination than the other schemes.	0.9744905231447131
In the long term, the effects were similar.	1.1966065230522906
This report describes a distinctive pattern of findings in peripheral sensory-nociceptive afferent nerves after spinal injury.	0.8534496611978112
Subsequent to trauma there was segmental, multisegmental or hemilateral hypoaesthesia with refractory, intenseful painful symptoms.	0.7484354879387742
None of the classical neurological causes for such hypoaesthesia were present.	0.9651030842915084
"Normal" therapy resulted in more severe symptoms.	0.8519323396277763
Depending on the distribution of the hypo- or anaesthesia, there were also efferent symptoms (coordination problems, impairments of proprioception, etc.).	1.0387534418660538
Colleagues who have made similar observations or are familiar with these symptoms are cordially invited to assist with the interpretation of this clinical picture.	0.938589670578828
The pharynx, being part of the digestive as well as the respiratory system, is embedded in the complex spatial anatomy of the neck and, due to its function and location, represents a very sophisticated region.	1.1896514927463828
Cisatracurium (51W89, Nimbex, Glaxo-Wellcome), an intermediate-acting non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent, is a stereoisomer of atracurium.	1.0599762359648428
Histamine releasing propensities and serum tryptase level have been investigated after administration of cisatracurium (3xED95, 5xED95) or vecuronium (3xED90) in surgical patients.	1.017307661535317
Methods: After approval by our institutional review board, 62 patients (ASA I-II) were randomly assigned to three groups to receive either 3xED95 or 5xED95 cisatracurium, or 3xED90 vecuronium as a rapid bolus.	0.9595208082581038
A prick test was done the day before by scarification of the skin in the forearm.	1.0383556136770813
After premedication with 2 mg lormetazepam, anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone (4-12 mg/kg) and maintained with O2/N2O and isoflurane (1.5-2 vol.%).	0.9019776093210389
Six minutes after thiopentone, the patients received the relaxant, and after further 6 min 0.1-0.2 mg fentanyl was given and the trachea was intubated.	1.2219113010531903
Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were monitored every minute.	0.7578047312481697
Blood samples for histamine were withdrawn 5 min prior 3 and 5 min after each drug administration (thiopentone, relaxants).	0.9317586879378488
Plasma histamine was measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) with a sensitivity of approximately 10 pg/ml.	1.0479471752667866
Additionally, serum tryptase was measured by RIA at baseline (-10 and  -1 min) and 15 and 60 min after the relaxant administration.	1.6048368287502612
Levels for histamine >1000 pg/ml and for tryptase >2 µg/ml were considered significant.	1.0765198490013697
Cutaneous signs of histamine release were documented.	0.4833540781190302
Results: Ten patients showed a positive prick-test reaction.	1.124072097305855
Only after thiopentone some cutaneous signs (4 flush, 1 erythema) of histamine release were observed.	1.2463084060463534
There were no cutaneous signs of histamine release correlating with cardiovascular changes.	0.9222904410248274
Analysis of the blood samples demonstrated no significant increase in the histamine level in all three groups.	1.2595514895792745
Only in 1 patient was a significant higher histamine level (1133 pg/ml) measured 5 min after 5xED95 cisatracurium.	1.0619975761286937
All measurements of serum tryptase were within the physiological limits.	0.9103889546088065
Discussion: In this study, with the particular time course of drug administration, neither cisatracurium nor vecuronium increased plasma histamine levels.	1.1965637143156354
Only after 5xED95 cisatracurium was 1 elevated histamine level documented after 5 min.	0.7470907375336958
In several studies increased histamine levels have been described, but without clinical manifestations.	1.188213469025759
It is known that cutaneous signs can occur without increased plasma histamine levels due to the structural heterogeneity of mast cells.	0.9491944263554161
The cutaneous reactions in this study were caused by thiopentone.	1.1481369351812196
The tryptase values were within normal limits even in the patient with histamine release.	1.1131554995308848
No relationship between the positive results in the prick test and the incidence of cutaneous reactions and/or histamine release for drugs used in the induction of anaesthesia was observed.	1.097607269735272
Whether cisatracurium has a potential for immunologic release is unknown.	0.8212049255106035
We report on a psychosis caused by application of a transdermal scopolamine patch for over 15 days.	0.9840635289666566
In the literature there is no mention of a case in which scopolamine had such an influence nor are any cases reported in which paranoid-hallucinatory symptoms cortinued 11 days after removing the patch.	1.060897493470675
Bone and joint tuberculosis, as all other types of tuberculosis is generally treated with antituberculotic combination chemotherapy.	0.9774374272893185
This has to be continued for a minimum of six months, or nine months in case of extensive spreading.	1.1141942069713535
A two- to three-month initial phase with four or five different drugs (H, R, Z, and additionally E and/or S) is followed by a four- to six-month therapy with H and R alone, provided the pathogen is fully susceptible to a standard regimen.	1.2064938782296688
The main side effects are hepatotoxic or allergic reactions.	0.8352022191378291
A frequent contra-indication is existing, often toxicity-induced, liver damage.	0.9968668141730984

This report concerns the case of a patient who had suffered a massive pulmonary embolus and for whom, despite immediately administered thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA it became necessary to initiate reanimation procedures.	1.0993471708263767
The patient was subsequently admitted to our cardiac surgery clinic for the purpose of operative intervention.	1.2546097414240327
After femorofemoral coupling on the heart-lung machine, right ventricular relieve was rapidly attained.	0.8665921336411466
During the course of a 3-hour period of extracorporal circulation, the initially significantly elevated pulmonary pressures were able to be reduced to moderate levels.	1.1479546166990908
Correspondingly, right ventricular recovery could be echocardiographically determined.	0.8024924120005608
As a consequence of this development, and after preclusion the presence of any large thrombotic masses which might have been situated in the pulmonary trunk, it was possible to forego thoracotomy and embolectomy.	1.1934408546117001
This procedure allowed, on the one hand, the avoidance of imminent right ventricular failure through the use of the heart-lung machine.	1.069678487499923
On the other, due to the lessening of the degree of surgical intervention, the risk of grave hemorrhaging as a result of concurrent thrombolytic therapy could be minimalized.	1.0300081096981821
After an uneventful course, the patient was able to be transferred on the second postoperative day with normal pulmonary pressure values.	1.238126071350368

Septic abortion remains one of the most serious threats to the health and life of women throughout the world.	1.050148896923062
Morbidity and mortality are infrequent in countries where induced abortion is legal and medically well organized, but widespread in many developing countries where it is either illegal or inaccessible.	1.0203766402859216
We observed two patients with stone formation in the renal pelvis two and five years after pyeloplasty.	1.000174629175551
In both cases there was no obstruction of the pyeloureteral junction detectable.	0.9230107196442895
We consider the use of Polyglactin (Vicryl) for the pelvis suture as reason for the stone formation.	1.082458353675164
For stone removal we favourite an endoscopic procedure, in which a removal of residuums of the suture is even possible as the verification of the pyeloureteral junction.	1.0501738508851752
Aim of the study: The aim was to determine the efficiency of a secure control of ventilation in emergency medicine by using capnometry.	1.100351560047953
This question was of special interest for mechanically ventilated patients with cerebral diseases, because here hyperventilation as well as hypoventilation can result in severe consequences.	1.0825008026816538
The advent of the excimer laser has brought about the potential for improved vision in many individuals with myopia and astigmatism.	0.8912859109307334
However, photoastigmatic refractive keratectomy (PARK) remains a matter of controversy.	0.9978025926930435
The purpose of our study was to determine the predictability of VISX 20/20 excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy in the treatment of myopic astigmatism.	0.8219754681316979
In Germany, insect allergies cause about 10-40 death per year.	0.8202696172026918
Starting a specific immunotherapy (SIT) and its maintenance may be lifesaving for the allergic patients.	1.059420289516718
Performing a prospective study, we exactly documented effects and side effects during the induction phase of SIT using a purified aqueous yellow jacket venom preparation in 20 patients allergic to yellow jacket venom (clinical degree II-IV).	0.963433681037541
Indication for the therapy was defined individually for each patient and was based on a score incorporating the following criteria: a) clinical symptoms, b) in-vivo- and in-vitro testing, c) risk of re-sting.	1.3473945841813109
SIT was started under inpatient conditions following a standardized 8 day protocol.	0.8060092763837852
At the end of the induction phase all patients tolerated the maintenance dose of 100 µg of yellow jacket venom without complications even though all showed local side effects (threshold doses 0.01-10 µg, median value 0.2 µg).	1.1084694090465117
40% of all patients showed subjective side effects (median value of threshold dose 30 µg, range 0.2-60 µg) and 30% showed objective side effects (median value of threshold dose 55 µg, range 20-80 µg); however, all side effects were clinically mild.	1.33013742537188
When objective systemic side effects were seen, the cumulative daily dose was 39-210 µg (median value 135 µg), exceeding 100 µg in 83% of patients.	1.2037241866298922
Our prospective study confirmed that the chosen protocol for SIT is effective in inducing tolerance to the venom preparation.	0.8978631415094313
However, using a purified aqueous yellow jacket preparation did not result in reduction of side effects.	1.0635234208052926
A 76 year old patient with actinic reticuloid was treated with Cyclosporin A.	0.9605722180841909
11 months after beginning the immunosuppressive therapy, he developed lymphoedema and livid nodular skin lesions of the right leg, which histologically showed Kaposi's sarcoma.	1.0855507203160701
After stopping the Cyclosporin A and intralesional therapy with Interferon alpha, no regression of the Kaposi sarcoma could be seen.	1.00803557540108
The characteristics of Kaposi sarcoma arising during immunosuppressive therapy and the differences in incidence, risk groups and distribution pattern compared to the classic sporadic and the AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma will be described.	1.0542566470379697
The development of Kaposi sarcoma during immunosuppressive therapy for actinic reticuloid has not been previously described.	0.8030060779759628
This analysis was undertaken to review the outcome and toxicity of postoperative adjuvant therapy for Stage II and III rectal cancer.	1.0063603057639128
We reviewed 112 patients treated with radiotherapy (44 patients) and radiochemotherapy (68 patients) after potentially curative (R0) surgery for rectal cancer (UICC Stages II and III), between 1983 and 1994 at the University Clinic of Würzburg.	1.2668922681985857
Median radiation dose was 56 Gy (range: 45 to 66 Gy).	0.9122106281132718
Chemotherapy consisted of 4 to 6 courses of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (420 mg/m2/d) and leucovorin (200 mg/m2/d).	1.0809737891748061
Median follow-up was 37 months.	1.0765769703160313
The overall survival was 84% for patients with UICC Stage II and 45% for patients with UICC Stage III disease (p = 0.0045).	0.939187127797786
There were no statistically significant differences between patients treated with radiochemotherapy vs radiotherapy in terms of 5-year survival (63% after radiochemotherapy vs 53% after radiotherapy, p = 0.16), relapse-free survival (52% vs 50%) and locoregional control (69% vs 67%).	1.2622334980623044
UICC Stage III disease was associated with high failure rates (40% pelvic recurrences and 53% distant metastases).	0.9322182579883085
There was a statistically significant difference in terms of the incidence of distant metastases between the 2 treatment modalities for patients with Stage III disease (49% 5-year probability for developing distant metastases after radiochemotherapy vs 66% after radiotherapy, p = 0.047).	1.0309502912343056
In a multivariate analysis, the addition of chemotherapy, lymph node stage and grading were independent prognostic factors for survival.	0.9349924531772226
Severe late toxicity was documented in 5% of treated patients.	1.1855713640102914
Prognosis of patients with UICC Stage III rectal cancer remains poor after "standard" surgery followed by postoperative adjuvant treatment (pelvic radiotherapy and bolus intravenous injection of 5-FU and leucovorin).	0.99986592473154
Major efforts should be made in order to improve prognosis for these patients, including optimization of surgical treatment and systemic treatment.	1.26596311673308
More effective multimodality treatment strategies should be investigated in prospective randomized trials.	0.8576116786751335
Andy Warhol underwent dermabrasion in 1957 because of a nasal skin lesion, which is best diagnosed as a rhinophyma on the basis of the available biographical literature.	1.1718822469568377
Throughout his creative life, the artist worked on different aspects of plastic surgery especially in the nasal area.	1.047347196652659
As one of the founders of Pop-Art, Warhol left essential marks on the modern society and influenced our standards of aesthetic shapes.	0.8063928267687835
Objective: The clinical activity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is not reliably reflected by laboratory measures.	1.1701870892738617
Proteolytic enzymes involved in the cascade of joint destruction are potentially useful parameters to monitor the extent of joint inflammation in RA.	0.937468500073702
This study compares the validity of two classes of proteolytic enzymes, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and lysosomal cysteine proteinases (cathepsin B, H, and L) as well as their respective inhibitors to serve as parameters of RA disease activity.	1.0294722252886261

Invasive selective coronary angiography as a clinical method is about 40 years old.	0.9390263009858353
This article surveying this period, written by an R&D engineer, deals with four parts: first the situation before 1965 is touched upon.	0.8780408832233435
For the time after 1965 the second and third parts describe the development of the procedure and of the technique with special reference to the work of Prof. Dr. K. Bachmann and to the facility, which in 1967 was designed together with him and further developed.	1.2468772620349493
K. Bachmann had already taken up the method of invasive coronary angiography around 1965, which makes him one of the group of pioneering users who developed the fundamentals of the procedure and led coronary angiography to its self-evident use today.	1.1280401576587824
The first clinical application of high resolution image intensifiers with the input screen produced from evaporated cesium iodide in 1971 appears as one of the highlights of the continuous improvements of the facility.	0.9227049105728815
The fourth part of the article sketches the status of today and, considering the new methods using MRI, EBCT as well as CT, it predicts that the invasive coronary angiography will remain an indispensable method at least for the medium-term future.	1.0908724733550512
Proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole) have revolutionized the therapy of peptic disease of the upper gastrointestinal tract and reduced the indications for surgical intervention.	1.1002514256315874
These substances inhibit the H+/K+-ATPase in the parietal cells with an acid suppressing potency that is much higher than that of H2-receptor-antagonists.	0.8962337421191351
The first proton pump inhibitor, omeprazole, has been introduced ten years ago.	0.9587867544187922
Since then, sufficient experience with this drug in children has accumulated.	1.0865781322948964
Omeprazole is released for children aged one year or older.	0.8078343872018955
A new formulation makes the drug applicable in tube fed patients.	0.7200348467016577
The main indications for the use of omeprazole are endoscopically verified peptic esophagitis and gastric and duodenal ulcerations of different etiologies.	0.9042707123544699
In the treatment of Helicobacter pylori-infection a sufficient acid suppression is essential for the efficacy of the antibiotics.	0.93717470067507
The recommended pediatric dose ranges between 0,7-1,4 mg/kg bodyweight and day.	1.152164590387262
However, some children with ulcerative esophagitis may need daily doses up to 3.5 mg/kg.	1.2588095337409808
Healing of the esophageal mucosa should be monitored by endoscopy.	0.8481203688931057
After remission, doses can often be reduced for maintenance therapy.	0.8584155321242003
Side effects are rare and do not seem to increase with higher doses.	1.1619456537120567
Possibly interactions with other medications, i.e.	0.5103897731034364
antiepileptic drugs, may occur.	0.7220430865115464
A long-term therapy lasting more than 6 months in a child should be monitored by an experienced pediatric gastroenterologist.	1.139402934842075
Nosocomial urinary tract infections (UTI) are frequent complications after transurethral prostatectomy.	0.9807511481624148
The resection itself, postoperative catheterization and the prostate are possible causes of these infections.	1.094774295692185
In this prospective study we investigated the influence of bacterial prostatic colonization on the incidence of postoperative urinary tract infections and inflammatory complications.	1.0157882181732671
In 78 patients we observed in 42 cases (53,8%) a bacterial prostatitis.	1.3519453529938925
In 14 patients (17,9%) we found nosocomial UTI's and in 12 patients (15,4%) inflammatory complications.	1.3379157845680294
The incidence of postoperative UTI's increase significantly in patients with positive prostate-cultures.	1.0266333087320545
On the other hand we only found corresponding prostate- and postoperative urine-cultures in less than 50%.	1.228212569190014
The presented data are not sufficient to conclude the kind of relevance of bacterial prostatic colonization for postoperative UTI's in transurethral prostatectomy.	0.8974038800027153
Under consideration of the significant increase of nosocomial UTI's in patients with positive prostate cultures a perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis seems to be required in general.	1.0313824377840095
Apnea, bradycardia and oxygen desaturation in infants with very low birth weight are common findings in neonatal intensive care.	0.8911068123335948
The prognostic significance of their intensity and frequency and the principles of treatment, however, are controversial.	1.1071000573976808
The universal aim, in order to prevent traumatization of the lung, is to ventilate infants with very low birth weight for as short a time as possible.	1.1010206934860307
Therefore drugs such as theophylline, aminophylline and doxapram and techniques such as nasal CPAP have been studied in our neonatal intensive care unit.	0.8384857802054753
In these studies we developed a treatment algorithm.	0.9351992867744325
In two clinically controlled studies performed successively we first proved that sodium acetate theophylline given intravenously has the same efficacy as aminophylline.	0.8164632181297098
As aminophylline has more side effects, sodium acetate theophylline is preferable.	0.6771924330016995
Bradycardia, apnea and desaturation were registered from the print-out of the monitoring system's trend analysis and in a polysomnographic study during steady-state conditions.	0.943009340685514
In a historical study we were able to prove that intravenous injection of aminophylline is superior to oral administration.	0.8849477541390044
We demonstrated equal efficacy of doxapram and theophylline; however, doxapram reduced the rate of apnea significantly more during the first 3 days of treatment.	1.0690380098673178
In a retrospective study we analyzed the efficacy of nasal CPAP as the third level of treatment.	1.0710390782852868
The rate of bradycardia, apnea and desaturation was significantly reduced during CPAP and respiratory rate and oxygenation improved.	0.9011135728946285
The algorithm developed established theophylline with 5 mg/ kg as bolus infusion over 20 min, followed by 3 mg/kg BID as the first line of treatment.	1.0135159349112672
Only if a quick therapeutic response was desirable was doxapram the first drug of choice (indication >=4 bradycardias below 80/min, 4 desaturations below 80% or 2 apneas of >=20 s over 2 h).	1.0944533536503909
After 48 h an additional second drug was added if we could still observe >=3 apneas, 15 bradycardias or 15 desaturations over this period.	0.9359021282999214
Nasal CPAP was introduced as the third line of treatment.	0.8237339630255307
With this treatment algorithm we were able to reduce the time on a respirator of infants with very low birth weight from 4.9 to 3.4 days (P<0.01).	0.9628035161008498
An evaluation of similar treatment algorithms in multi-institutional studies is indicated.	0.6999181280224311
Background: Associations between back pain, the quality of sleep and the quality of matresses have not yet been investigated systematically.	1.1952766033783186
Methods: At check-out we asked 265 consecutive guests of a trade fair hotel about the subjective quality of sleep in the previous night.	1.1094342513040012
Nine rooms had been equipped with new mattresses of three different qualities and prices, but this was kept blind to the hotel staff and the guests.	1.081705949288922
Sleep quality was assessed on an analog scale between 1 (very good) and 5 (very bad) and was analyzed in comparison to the remaining 8-year old mattresses of the hotel, but also with respect to social (e.g.	1.3895670998451441
private vs. professional reason for the stay) as well as personal (e.g.	0.7720599843304392
previous experience with low back and sleep complaints) characteristics of the guests.	0.9248935973923085
Results: The three qualities of the mattresses correlated significantly and positively with the perceived quality of sleep, but the difference to the "old" mattresses was most pronounced for those guests who were staying overnight for professional reasons, or who frequently were suffering from low back pain or sleep disturbances.	1.1164033601806622
Conclusion: At least for chronic sufferers from back pain and sleep problems, the association between sleep quality and quality of the mattress is significant.	1.2854362056842261
Body oriented psychotherapy is used nowadays in in-patient and out-patient settings, individually or in groups, alone or combined with other methods.	0.9869087208833818
These methods have special importance in patients whose body feeling is reduced, who are restricted in their emotions, or for those who are difficult to reach because of resistances of character.	1.1170865330975763
Short examples are given as an introduction to the methods used often the most nowadays, reference is made to other procedures.	1.0265700357010756
The connection of emotions to the vegetative and autonomic nervous system inter alia and the link between emotional and physical processes which is especially strong to the beginning of life and which combines with the specifically experienced form of interaction and has psychobiological consequences are mentioned as active factors.	0.9842173340391415
In later development, the body and certain parts of the body acquire a symbolical meaning too, which is important for the therapy.	1.222497200002387
The relationship of body oriented procedures to verbal psychotherapy and especially to psychoanalysis shall also be discussed.	0.9898703821407872
Approaches to empirical research are pointed out.	0.5521864211709442
Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes are rare diseases that occur in relation to cancer.	0.8805283327771225
Supporting the hypothesis of an autoimmune mechanism, specific antineuronal antibodies have sometimes been detected.	0.9244587236086373
The current possibilities for treatment are limited.	0.8201166467941008
A female patient, aged 57, suffering from a breast cancer, developed a severe paraneoplastic cerebellar syndrome and limbic encephalitis within a few weeks.	1.0112452485130068
It is possible that the impressive partial remission that occurred during the ensuing 6 months was not due to therapy.	1.0605553801134497
Although the patient was still bound to a wheelchair, discharge from hospital was possible because she was still able to perform daily tasks by herself.	1.0892078387585173
A recurrence of the cerebellar symptoms with mild alterations of mental status occurred 2 months later but again showed a good remission.	0.9689595092313925
