This effect is related to some additional direct cerebral vasodilating potency of racemic ketamine based on a mechanism involving blockade of Ca++ channels.	0.950398787971273
The effects of racemic ketamine on CBF autoregulation have not been investigated systematically.	0.8013488990844803
However, studies in rats have shown that CBF autoregulation was maintained with low- and high-dose S(+)-ketamine.	1.2541870107395316
Infusion of racemic ketamine alters intracranial volume and ICP.	0.7319721038857878
Studies in spontaneously ventilating pigs with and without intracranial hypertension have shown that racemic ketamine (0.5-5.0 mg/kg) produces increases in PaCO2 and ICP.	1.0010106720855763
In contrast, identical experiments with mechanical ventilation and controlled PaCO2 showed no changes in ICP following racemic ketamine infusion.	0.9700704563075164
This implies that increases in ICP are related to inadequate ventilation with consecutive hypercapnia and increases in intracranial blood volume.	0.877599714935852
However, mechanical ventilation may not be sufficient to control ICP following racemic ketamine.	1.2803314961925638
Experiments in mechanically ventilated dogs indicate that racemic ketamine (2 mg/kg) increases cerebral blood volume and ICP even in the presence of normoventilation, a response that is reversible by hyperventilation or the administration of diazepam.	1.0668971407707422
Studies in patients have shown that racemic ketamine (2.0 mg/kg) reduces CBF in the presence of cerebral vasodilators like halothane or N2O.	0.9055460706335634
In contrast, studies in unanaesthetised humans showed increases in CBF after racemic ketamine (2-3 mg/kg).	0.9634221036576291
This observation is consistent with animal studies and suggests that the cerebrovascular effects of racemic ketamine are related to the pre-existing cerebrovascular tone induced by background anaesthetics.	0.6230316126368938
Dengue-Fever is a mosquito transmitted viral disease.	0.6503559282907619
It is endemic mainly in South-East Asia and Afrika.	0.7186418233973374
The clinical manifestation is divided into different stages.	0.6583124989253416
Ocular manifestations in travellers have been rarely reported.	0.6879231414952879
Sufficient and regular wetting of the cornea with a normal preocular tear film is an essential requirement for the accurate visual functioning of the eye.	1.0158878493231838
Multiple factors may cause tear film instability.	0.7323690381174051
Measuring the break-up time of the preocular tear film is a necessary, clinically reliable means for evaluating tear film stability.	1.0313615979543405
We designed a new instrument to observe the preocular tear film at high magnification which can contribute to the in vivo imaging of the physiological and pathophysiological dynamics of the tear film and its break-up phenomena.	0.9389100437540756
The prevalence of hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV infections among drug abuse-related fatalities in Hamburg (1985-1997) was investigated with respect to epidemiological, forensic and morphological aspects.	1.0350789733892078
The purpose of this study was (1) to determine the prevalence of hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV infections among drug abuse-related fatalities (drug deaths) in Hamburg from 1985 to 1997, (2) to assess the rate of multiple infections and (3) to analyze the liver histomorphology in 100 autopsied drug deaths.	1.1612959538499903
Furthermore, we discuss the epidemiological and forensic aspects.	1.3489434014640382
In this period 1469 drug deaths were registered with a prevalence for HBV of 35% (1997: 39%), for HCV 51% (1997: 58%), and for HIV 7% (1997: 15%).	1.2359866083013662
Co-infections were common (28%) and 19% of all cases were infected with HBV and HCV.	1.1300998193140785
The liver histology showed that hepatitis was frequently diagnosed (74%) and was associated with HBV and/or HCV infections (77% of all hepatitis cases).	1.152738266260205
Only 9% showed a normal liverhistology.	1.332844127321725
Forensic autopsies and monitoring of HBV, HCV and HIV infections in drug deaths represent an important tool to gain information about the individual case and the situation among i.v.	1.0048105777125216
Background: An abnormal coronary flow reserve represents an early marker of impaired blood flow regulation in the natural history of coronary atherosclerosis under the impact of risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia.	1.2089254856100593
Our clinical investigation was aimed at assessing noninvasively the integrative coronary flow response to dipyridamole stress in 18 consecutive patients with microvascular angina, only moderately elevated LDL-cholesterol levels (168 +/- 33 mg/dl), and reduced vasodilator capacity despite normal (n=9) or slightly abnormal (n=9) coronary arteriograms (minimal disease with luminal irregularities and/or diameter reduction <=30%) before and after 6-month lipid-lowering therapy (simvastatin).	1.0552688461072277
Methods: Regional and averaged myocardial blood flow were measured at rest and after dipyridamole induced vasodilation (0.56 mg/kg) using dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and N-13 ammonia as flow tracer related to a 3-compartment kinetic model.	1.1470221187205187
Baseline data (mean +/- SD): 13 males, 5 females; mean age: 56 +/- 8 years; basal coronary flow: 90 +/- 22 ml/minx100 g; after lipid intervention: 93 +/- 18 ml/minx100 g (n.s.).	1.0912379585331449
Total cholesterol decreased to 170 +/- 36 mg/dl (p<0.001); mean LDL level: 97 +/- 26 mg/dl (p<0.001).	0.9570657401356154
Coronary dilator capacity increased, assessed in terms of minimal coronary resistance: 0.38 +/- 0.08 vs 0.49 +/- 0.09 units at baseline (p<0.01), myocardial blood flow under dipyridamole: 232 +/- 43 vs 186 +/- 37 ml/minx100 g at baseline (p<0.01), and instantaneous flow ratio: 2.6 +/- 0.7 vs 2.2 +/- 0.6 (p=0.06).	1.062893942913062
Concomitantly, a considerable regression of angina was noticed in the majority of patients.	1.0719952842954656
Conclusions: An improvement of the non-invasively determined integrative dipyridamole induced coronary vasodilator capacity may be achieved after 6 months by intensive lipid lowering at a very early stage of coronary atherosclerosis.	1.0914499617911342
Consequently, aggressive cholesterol-lowering therapy represents an antiischemic and antianginal approach suggesting, at least in part, functional reversal and probably prevention of further disease progression.	1.0143998584778606
We report the case of a a 60 year-old worker in the pharmaceutical industry who suffered from recurring contact dermatitis.	1.0484345300841467
Initially the contact dermatitis was limited to the hands; later on it became generalized.	0.9224649416851368
The patient had been working on a drug filling line in a pharmaceutical plant for more than 20 years.	1.0068525384697042
Eight years after starting this job he had developed allergic hand dermatitis to 2,6-diaminopyridine (patch test positive); this healed upon cessation of exposure.	0.8688692738239183
Ten years later he again developed hand dermatitis which progressed to generalized dermatitis and conjunctivitis.	0.7950894788402625
Under systemic and local therapy with corticosteroids and cessation of work, it healed nearly completly.	0.9991985494702943
Four months after returning to work, the patient experienced a first episode of severe asthma and generalized dermatitis with conjunctivitis following exposure to hydroxychloroquine the day before.	1.0742630463680571
The asthma and dermatitis improved after systemic corticosteroid therapy and stopping work.	0.7352682195320319
His condition continued to fluctuate, when though the patient was transferred at work and now wore rubber gloves.	1.0691711801527153
Eight months later he again developed a generalized dermatitis.	0.8443197042259627
Patch testing revealed delayed-type sensitizations to hydroxychloroquine (tested in concentrations of 0.1%, 0.5%, 1% and 2%).	1.3229562039530376
Equivalent tests in five healthy volunteers were negative.	0.7352666041747796
The patch test reactions were pustular, while a biopsy was interpreted as a multiform contact dermatitis reaction.	0.9892668474710332
Bronchial exposure with hydroxychloroquine dust produced a delayed bronchial obstruction over the next 20 hours, which progressed to fever and generalized erythema (hematogenous contact dermatitis).	0.9746572578327314
After removing exposure to 2,6-diaminopyridine and hydroxychloroquine, the patient went on to develop a contact dermatitis to latex (patch test positive).	1.012359385825831
However, skin prick tests with latex and patch tests with rubber additiva were negative.	1.1597197766067469
Hydroxychloroquine is well known to cause drug reactions.	1.0468271770526247
To our knowledge, contact dermatitis to this substance has not yet been reported.	0.8165370437971478
It is noteworthy that the patch test reactions were pustular and of multiform morphology and that bronchial exposure to the allergen resulted in asthma and a generalized drug reaction.	0.8961883323066119
Pathogenetically the asthmatic reaction seems to be on a delayed-type mechanism as is also seen with ampicillin, cobalt and nickel induced asthma.	0.8765682708371095
A 45 years old female runner developed a bilateral tendinopathy of the Achilles tendon after repeated antimicrobiotical treatment with ciprofloxacin.	0.9416628784120314
One month later the right Achilles tendon ruptured without any sudden pain.	0.7931314449790933
MRI revealed degenerative changes of the left Achilles tendon; on the right side the tendon was ruptured with a dehiscence of 4 cm between both ends of the tendon.	1.1322990794034367
The tendon was reconstructed surgically.	0.7041769779664894
The histological analysis showed cystic changes with focal necrosis.	0.7243180852317705
This finding differ from findings in non drug induced tendinopathies.	0.7682057287756586
After antimicrobiotical treatment with ciprofloxacin the side effect of a tendon disorder must be considered.	0.8851496109374452
The impairment of the tendon may be as strong that a tendon rupture may occur at daily living activities without any typical clinical symptoms.	1.0551850128975067
The recent results obtained from investigations based on molecular biological techniques have led to a better understanding of recurrent genetic causes important for the pathogenesis of tumors.	1.0096931587292688
Several genes have been identified as being involved in the development of cancer.	0.8924489710840598
In many cases, the activation of oncogenes or the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes is the predominant reason for cancerogenic cell transformation.	1.0294236756350241
Functional dysregulation is frequently the consequence of mutations, resulting in an alteration of the primary structure of the DNA.	1.1342954726176775
As our understanding of the nature, function, and interaction of these genes evolves, new opportunities for early diagnosis, classification, prevention, and treatment of malignant tumors will arise.	1.1856079149480485
The present report summarizes the current molecular biological aspects of several oncogenes (erbB, ras, myc, raf, fos, jun, bcl, mdm 2, myb, kit CSF1R, met) and tumor suppressor genes (p 53, rb, mts) involved in lung-cancer development with respect to the pathology of lung tumors, including the importance of these genes as far as the clinical course of the disease is concerned.	1.1856088904321556
Hyperbaric Oxygen (HBO) therapy is a kind of medical treatment in which a patient breathes 100% of oxygen inside a pressure chamber while the pressure of the chamber is increased to a point higher than sea level pressure.	1.1706303901527053
It is strongly based on clearly defined physical laws and physiological regularities.	0.7758269907668929
For the clinical use of HBO therapy, according to international recommendations, there are several commonly accepted indications in which HBO either is the only causative life-saving kind of treatment, or is an essential and oftenly decisive component of a comprehensive interdisciplinary intensive care therapy.	1.1181863593816281
Among potential adverse effects, barotrauma of the lungs and especially oxygen toxicity to the central nervous system have to be mentioned.	0.9682817639144421
Clinical use of HBO therefore requires special knowledge of its effects, risks, and adverse effects, a clear and distinct indication, and the ability and skills to keep complications under control by means of intensive care or emergency medical measures.	1.1568577922483807
The clinical use of hyperbaric oxygen with its interdisciplinary-like character of emergency medicine or intensive care therapy therefore should be an additional, most interesting field of activity for the anaesthesiologist.	1.0872973031422777
Although arthroscopy of the ankle joint has been well established, there are only very few reports about arthroscopy in ankle fracture treatment.	1.1494634732054432
In order to sytematically analyze the intraarticular lesions of ankle fractures, we assessed 196 consecutive ankle fractures immediately before ORIF.	0.9862152869570286
There were 94 male and 101 female patients with an average age of 47.8 years (16-88 years).	0.9815355306723833
There were more cartilage lesions found than expected, and cartilage lesions were not noted more frequently in type C-fractures than in type B-fractures.	1.1618752649053157
In both fracture types, an increasing amount of cartilage lesions was found from group 1 to 3.	1.0579470586691326
In addition, more ligament injuries were found than expected, especially in the B.1- and B.2-fractures.	1.4430301764859548
Successful arthroscopic surgery was performed in 26 cases: internal fixation, 9; loose body removal, 7; ligament reposition, 5; cartilage smoothening, 4; and cartilage fracture repair, 1.	1.0770370842065486
In one case, a periostal flap could not be reduced, and in another case, the internal fixation of the medial malleolus was not stable.	1.2155200013103746
In summary, arthroscopy was shown to be a very helpful diagnostic tool in ankle fractures.	1.1632319147395787
As long-term results are not yet available, it remains, however, unclear as to whether arthroscopy may improve the success of the following ORIF.	1.487182221077868
Arthroscopy was also shown to be a successful tool for several closed surgical procedures.	1.0140875644207201
Of these, percutaneous internal fixation of the medial malleolus under arthroscopic view may be an excellent indication.	1.182936519205983
Objective: Transcultural adaption of the two most widely used and accepted functional indices in ankylosing spondylitis, the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) and Dougados Functional Index (D-FI).	1.1005866836990505
Methods: The instruments were translated and tested for internal consistency (Cronbach's coefficient alpha), test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC), construct validity (testing for association with Schober's test, finger floor distance, occiput wall distance, frequency and duration of awakenings at night, and a visual analog scale pain), and responsiveness (standardized response mean, SRM).	1.0704388839719723
Results: The study sample consisted of 72 patients of a randomized, controlled clinical trial receiving either Diclofenac or placebo.	1.0735749845275915
Visual assessment of distribution patterns revealed a ceiling effect of both instruments.	0.811888349731904
Both questionnaires had a high internal consistency (Cronbach alpha: 0.81 [BASFI], 0.85 [D-FI] and a high test-retest reliability (ICC: 0.92 [BASFI], 0.89 [D-FI]).	1.1583728469447574
The limited responsiveness to Diclofenac treatment (SRM: 0.46 [BASFI],  0.33 [D-FI]) may be related to the selected study sample.	1.1566643375923809
The BASFI was significantly correlated with all tested validation parameters.	0.7326336965558687
The  D-FI was only significantly correlated with finger floor distance, occiput wall distance, and duration of awakenings at night.	0.8285968220978217
Conclusion: The transculturally adapted version of both functional indices are valid, reliable, and internally consistent.	1.0998987543898293
Because of psychometric advantages, the BASFI may be preferred in clinical trial settings.	1.0401539159781026
The role of radiotherapy of the pelvic lymphatic pathways in patients with node positive prostate cancer remains uncertain.	1.030926241698285
Interpretation of the few prospective studies (RTOG 75-06 and 77-06) is hampered by severe flaws in the study design.	1.116729203976599
Extension of the radiation to the paraaortal region shows no advantage over radiation of the pelvic lymphatics alone and is not warranted.	0.9988403276125162
Data on longterm side-effects are only available from older studies with outdated radiation techniques.	0.907981709291524
According to more recent studies short term side effects are considerably higher with radiation of the pelvic lymphatics when compared with radiation of the prostate alone.	1.052310306311855
In summary radiation of the lymphatic pathways in lymph node positive prostate cancer cannot currently be considered as standard treatment and should be carried out within clinical studies.	1.0249672345932206
In reconstruction of cartilage defects, autogenous transplantation is known as a reliable and experienced method.	0.9639467037803277
Although a clinical application has not been reported until now, tissue engineering permits in vitro production of autogenous cartilage transplants.	1.0556440065019392
Nevertheless, in both methods the cartilage is exposed to individually varying resorptive mechanisms.	1.170048216947748
Among other methods for in vivo tissue protection, the encapsulation with a semipermeable polyelectrolytecomplex membrane could guarantee sufficient protection against resorptive influences.	0.934102853462347
Human septal cartilage was encapsulated (group 1) with polyelectrolytecomplex membranes and subcutaneously implanted on the back of thymusaplastic nude mice.	1.0383805860388018
Cartilage implants without encapsulation (group 2) were used as control.	1.1192201980916392
Scanning electron microscopy and histochemical investigations were performed 1, 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks after implantation.	1.0813382786148182
Group 1 showed no signs of resorption and chronic inflammation at all.	0.8811932177873414
In contrast, group 2 presented, correlating to the time of implanta-tion, increasing signs of cell death and fibrotic transformation, representing an increased activity of resorption.	1.1738682750470302
In conclusion, tissue encapsulation with a polyelectrolytecomplex membrane could ensure a sufficient protection of human cartilage transplants from resorptive influences.	1.0045312771629664
For the plastic-reconstructive surgeon the desired result becomes more calculable.	0.8401739143852828
Subjective time-experience and objective time-estimation were examined in 20 endogenous, 20 neurotic depressives, and 15 healthy volunteers.	1.2280359854980227
Subjective experience of past and anticipated future time was more extended in both depressive groups than in healthy controls.	0.832518740636908
Objective time estimation differed between depressives and controls concerning relatively long time spans whereas very short time spans were correctly estimated also by depressives.	0.8524030888488364
There were no significant differences between endogenous and neurotic depressives.	0.8117186164242156
The perception of extended time normalized during treatment.	0.697688082412349
The depressives' time perception, differences correlated with the extent of depressive psychopathological symptoms and - to a lesser degree - with retardation.	1.2060687196827957
The findings support the hypotheses of anthropological phenomenology concerning disturbed time perception and estimation in depressives.	0.7337126169554055
Amelioration of experienced time-extension in intentionally structured time spans compared to empty time spans suggests psychotherapeutic consequences in the sense of Lewinsohn.	0.8546043549258205
We investigated whether the free-to-total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ratio (f-PSA/t-PSA ratio; i. e. percentage of free PSA) represents a better discriminator for the detection of cancer of the prostate (CaP).	1.0329941872555235
In a retrospective analysis, the persentage of free PSA was determined in the sera of 35 patients with histologically proven benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 35 patients with clinically localized CaP.	1.1951217006974955
Patients with urolithiasis (n = 33) served as a control group.	0.9898333550511413
Serum levels of free PSA and total PSA were determined employing a chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay.	0.8264312096419889
Patients with CaP demonstrated a lower percentage of free PSA (median: 8.7) than patients with BPH (median: 20.0; P < 0.001) and those with urolithiasis (median: 18.8; P < 0.001).	1.0380457837222685
Determination of the percentage of free PSA enhances the differentiation between BPH and CaP and may reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies in patients with an elevated PSA.	1.0644521800955828
Confirmation of our preliminary results is required.	0.5877135371858001
Psychological problems in children and parents related to children's atopic eczema (AE) may impede the success of treatment.	1.0727053306624623
We studied the question, if behavior-based parental education in groups (DPE) or standardized video-education (VPE) could enhance dermatological treatment effects and reduce skin-damaging behaviors in children and stress in their mothers.	1.1160327938305499
Sevoflurane degrades in CO2 absorbents to produce compound A, which may have  hepatotoxic potential in humans.	1.0737034646030903
Several recent studies in human volunteers have been performed to evaluate this potential.	1.0792896749507537
Three studies have evaluated sevoflurane administered to volunteers using a 3% concentration for 8 h duration at approximately 2 L/min flow rate.	1.0453888216515257
The initial investigation found high excretion of protein, glucose and renal tubular enzymes in the urine of the volunteers receiving sevoflurane.	0.9468771907034349
Subsequent investigations using identical protocols found more minor or absent changes in excretion of these markers.	0.821322976405499
One additional investigation in volunteers studied 3% sevoflurane anesthesia for 4 h duration using a low-flow (1 L/min) technique.	1.2481682706898234
No significant excretion of protein, glucose or renal enzymes was observed.	0.7401498480842855
Application of these results to clinical practice must be interpreted in light of the experimental nature of the anesthetic administration.	1.1898418764831749
Although some controversy remains, these data, combined with results of recent studies in surgical patients, suggest that renal function following modest duration low-flow sevoflurane anesthesia is similar to that following isoflurane anesthesia.	1.1250486660400967
Background: The microbial colonization of the intestinal tract in newborns begins during delivery.	0.9627495017680368
Streptococci and Escherichia coli pave the way for the bifidobacterial dominance typical in breast-fed newborns.	0.8203589585880038
They provide optimal living conditions for anaerobic bifidobacteria by withdrawal of intraluminal oxygen.	0.7183839885108114
A mixed intestinal flora is established on infant formula feeding in the infant.	0.7539315236080644
Bifidobacteria, Bacteroides, Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci and lactobacilli are the main genera of this mixed intestinal flora.	0.8671335128438359
This represents an intermediate stage of the microflora in adults.	0.8561222466093471
The bifidogenic effect of mothers' milk is based on the active substances it contains, which selectively enhance the growth of bifidobacteria, whereas other active substances suppress the growth of the accompanying flora.	1.132601432317602
Bifidus-enhancing factors in breast-feeding are lactose, oligosaccharides, glycoproteins such as glycomacropeptide and the inoculation with bifidobacteria deriving from the skin surface of the mother.	0.9436813955209035
Factors directed to the suppression of the accompanying microflora are antibodies, lactoferrin, lysozyme, fatty acids and monoglycerides that act as antimicrobial substances and the comparatively low protein and iron content in mothers' milk.	0.8428673857896545
A bifidus-inhibiting colonization of the intestinal tract with pathogenic germs is caused by maternal birth-canal infections, which are now known to be the most frequent reason for premature births.	1.1395452006008628
An increasing number of surgical deliveries, the separation of the newborn infant from its mother, and the generous use of antibiotics contribute to the delayed colonization of bifidobacteria and to the development of life-threatening nosocomial infections.	1.2891880267262243
Counteractive measures against this disastrous situation are the preferential use of bifidobacteria-preserving antibiotics and the inoculation of lyophilized bifidobacteria.	0.900704755828368
Between January 1983 and December 1987, metatarsal head-resections were performed on 203 patients, comprising a total of 370 feet, using the Hueter/Mayo and Hoffmann procedure.	0.9605086247091642
Seventy-two patients, comprising a total of 126 feet, were available for post-operative review after an average of 11.4 years from the date of the original operations.	1.1796600870745089
The information obtained from standardized questionnaires was compared to the information found in each patient's file.	1.081803092509125
In addition, every available pre- and post-operative x-ray taken from 1983 to 1987 was analyzed.	1.0813157194115253
Thus, with an average follow-up period of 5.6 years, the changes found in the pre- and post-operative x-rays from a total of 183 feet could be compared.	1.3318002782613791
Before the operations, nearly 100% of the examined feet suffered from painful synovial hypertrophy and erosion of the metatarsophalangeal joints with dislocation and subluxation, causing approximately 70% of all patients to have great difficulties in walking.	1.0859322840971104
After the operations, however, 90.2% of the patients reported that this condition had noticeably improved or had completely disappeared.	1.23181964732436
In fact, 87.5% of all patients reported a lasting improvement in their ability to walk longer distances.	1.1040970893079343
As the main criteria in determining the success of an operation (namely, the noticeable reduction of pain and increased mobility) were achieved in 87.5% of the patients, we consider the metatarsal head-resection a reliable method of correcting forefoot deformities in rheumatoid arthritis.	1.1975099094303658
Bone metabolism is influenced by systemic and local acting hormons.	0.7597701515074996
Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) as representatives of the latter substances are known to have the ability for ectopic bone formation.	1.127510920350042
Within this study, we investigated the influence of different growth factors on the proliferation- and differentiation rate of osteoblast-like cells.	1.1473420462277606
For that purpose, human osteoblast-like cells (HPOC) were incubated in the presence of either recombinant BMP-4 of the genome of xenopus laevis (rxBMP-4), recombinant human BMP 2 (rhBMP-2), transforming growth factor-ß (TGF-ß) or basic fibroblast growth factor (rh-bFGF) in two different concentrations each (10 ng/ml and 50 ng/ml).	1.1609703853740512
Cell proliferation was measured within a MTT [3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromid] assay, the amount of cell differentiation by the activity of alcaline phosphatase.	1.3332224896540454
Rx-BMP-4 induced a differentiation of HPOC to almost the same extent as rhBMP-2, whereas the addition of rh-bFGF, applied at the same concentration, failed to have any influence on cell differentiation.	1.073376757443745
However, rh-bFGF provoked an increase in cell proliferation when compared with unstimulated HPOC, while rhBMP-2 and rxBMP-4 showed no effect on proliferation.	1.1675876137306493
TGF-ß influenced bone proliferation as well as differenciation significantly.	0.7873171681612109
The equipotent effect of recombinant human BMP-2 and recombinant BMP-4 obtained from Xenopus laevis with regard to differentiation and proliferation of human primary osteoblast-like cells originates either in the fact that target cells have receptors for BMP 2 as well as BMP 4, or that both BMP's link to the same receptor with almost the same affinity.	1.0382762713781906
Sonography has provided an important addition to the tools available for the diagnosis of the soft tissues in the head and neck region.	1.02876134774903
The ENT surgeon himself is able to examine pathological formations by this quick, non-invasive and, last but not least, less expensive method.	0.9395675598149904
Due to the high resolution of the procedure the chance of detecting even small changes is increased and the exactness of diagnosis of pathological lymph nodes of the neck has been significantly improved compared to palpation alone.	1.1746762440061218
Ultrasound has replaced the sialographic procedures in the field of diagnostic evaluation of salivary gland disease in the daily practice except for special indications.	0.982992890012493
After inauguration of color Doppler sonography non-invasive evaluation of vascular stenosis of the large cervical vessels concerning their hemodynamic effects has become possible.	0.9336565216741113
This issue is important for the differential dignosis of otoneurological diseases such as sudden hearing loss, vertigo and tinnitus.	0.8642286598292022
Additionally, the extent of perfusion of space-occupying lesions can be easily examined, and therefore the risk of mass bleeding can be preoperatively assessed by this method without harm to the patient.	1.1207978137616774
Especially carotid body tumors may be diagnosed with high accuracy by the evidence of significant diffuse perfusion of the lesion.	0.9371107760088063
In several studies the specificity of the assessment of cervical lymph node disease could be increased by examination of resistance indices.	1.0955842738980235
However, other authors have shown inconsistent results in differentiation of benign and malignant lumps; therefore, final judgment does not seem to be possible yet.	1.225275690428432
Use of echo-contrast agents to enhance the ultrasound signal seems to be a promising approach for future developments in color Doppler imaging.	1.001804840308837
Painful stiffness of the shoulder is an ill-defined clinical entity that is difficult to assess and delicate to treat.	1.0233171532961534
The nomenclature used is broad and includes terms such as frozen shoulder, adhesive capsulitis, focal algodystrophy, stiff shoulder, contracted shoulder, and others.	0.930393293334749
Apart from its idiopathic form, the disease can be initiated by trauma, infection, tumour, radiation, systemic and local metabolic disturbances.	1.1634638649060562
Pathoanatomically, the common denominator is an inflammatory vascular proliferation followed by thickening, scarring, and retraction of the joint capsule.	1.0408165135051135
The inflammatory process often starts at the rotator interval and may extend to the subacromial space.	0.8922369861754963
The prognosis for patients in whom metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is not treated is unfavorable, with a reported 5-year survival of 0-18 %.	1.2468184427680014
Before the era of immunotherapy and in the absence of effective nonsurgical therapy, resection of metastases was the accepted way to prolong survival, giving a 5-year survival of 7-69 %.	1.0998797456936296
Retrospective studies have shown that several clinical factors are associated with a relatively good prognosis.	0.9201843365106073
Some patients will benefit from resection of metastases, but most patients with metastatic RCC are not candidates for such aggressive surgery.	1.0524605740161983
The use of interleukin-2 has demonstrated that immunotherapy can produce durable remissions.	0.8931507878508076
Without randomized trials, it is difficult to know whether survival is longer than that in untreated patients, but there is clear evidence that immunotherapy improves survival and yields long-lasting remissions in selected patients.	1.1016074982218105
Many questions remain concerning quality of life and the benefit-to-risk ratio of immunotherapy, but it is the most effective treatment for metastatic RCC.	1.2659180062695838
After loss of active glenohumeral motion the arm cannot be positioned in space and function is impaired.	0.8668653573359741
Fusion of the glenohumeral joint creates a new platform for the movement of elbow, hand and fingers and leads to an improvement of function.	0.874910968924685
The use of the reconstructive plate makes the operation easier.	0.885704770915569
Shoulder fusion is especially suited if the function of elbow and hand is well preserved and if the patient is physically active.	1.0522677010775592
But fusion is definite and the options of muscle transfer operations and above elbow amputation have to be considered.	0.8567181904328487
The unreamed femoral nail (UFN) system, with its numerous proximal interlocking options, allows a minimal invasive surgical procedure for the treatment of nearly all femoral fracture patterns.	1.086757681607608
Sixty-six fractures, 5 cases of osteolysis or pathologic fractures, 2 limb shortenings and 1 lengthening (monorail technique) and 3 cases of pseudarthrosis were stabilised with the UFN from July 1994 to December 1996.	1.1605341803032339
The fractures were analysed according to the AO classification.	0.8093773953375878
We found 31 polytrauma patients with an mean ISS of 21.8 and a mean PTS of 25.4.	1.1591929868854711
Most of the multiply injured patients (n = 26) were stabilised with the UFN primarily.	1.1725606681828313
Follow-up of 44 patients ranged from 4 to 18 months postoperatively.	1.1403774316349147
According to our clinical and radiological score the results were excellent in 34 % of cases, good in 36.3 %, poor in 20.4 % and bad in 9 %.	1.295770098626633
Average fracture healing time was about 9.8 weeks.	0.9774690297772204
Fractures of the atlas account for 1-2 % of all vertebral fractures.	1.3155175237707257
We divide atlas fractures into 5 groups: isolated fractures of the anterior arch of the atlas, isolated fractures of the posterior arch, combined fractures of the anterior and posterior arch (so-called Jefferson fractures), isolated fractures of the lateral mass and fractures of the transverse process.	1.1649855142806418
Isolated fractures of the anterior or posterior arch are benign and are treated conservatively with a soft collar until the neck pain has disappeared.	1.1219290813531837
Jefferson fractures are divided into stable and unstable fracture depending on the integrity of the transverse ligament.	0.9505523626880445
Stable Jefferson fractures are treated conservatively with good outcome while unstable Jefferson fractures are probably best treated operatively with a posterior atlanto-axial or occipito-axial stabilization and fusion.	0.9627721414374935
The authors preferred treatment modality is the immediate open reduction of the dislocated lateral masses combined with a stabilization in the reduced position using a transarticular screw fixation C1/C2 according to Magerl.	0.9788897535084061
This has the advantage of saving the atlanto-occipital joints and offering an immediate stability which makes immobilization in an halo or Minerva cast superfluous.	0.8540902534675843
In late instabilities C1/2 with incongruency of the lateral masses occurring after primary conservative treatment, an occipito-cervical fusion is indicated.	0.9664814703509323
Isolated fractures of the lateral masses are very rare and may, if the lateral mass is totally destroyed, be a reason for an occipito-cervical fusion.	1.110554532639319
Fractures of the transverse processes may be the cause for a thrombosis of the vertebral artery.	1.1961239793982164
No treatment is necessary for the fracture itself.	1.0499069840210646
Reported is the case of a 36-year-old man with neurofibromatosis type 1 with lethal haemorrhage from rupture of the left common iliac artery.	1.1510680052723075
Histologically and immunohistochemically, no hints on angiodysplasia as a possible cause of bleeding were detected.	0.9830308117466219
Considering the literature and the histological findings in the area of rupture, a local weakness of the vascular wall caused by the neighbouring neurofibromatous proliferates was most probably the reason for bleeding.	1.1965137169799305
We report on a 2-year-old girl with chronic bullous disease of childhood (CBDC).	1.1274654320283561
Concomitantly with a feverish gastrointestinal infection caused by Salmonella enteritidis, the child presented with lesions resembling impetigo contagiosa on the legs and face.	0.9529876007454188
Following antibiotic treatment with cephalosporins p.o.	0.6417746597469365
she developed typical symptoms of CBDC, i.e.	0.5606925410704183
tense blisters on erythematous skin in the perineal area, on the flexor aspects of the thighs and upper arms and on the face.	0.9450430040713551
Direct immunofluorescence revealed a linear IgA deposition along the basement membrane zone, confirming the diagnosis of CBDC.	0.8267226055782434
These lesions cleared rapidly after treatment with dapsone p.o.	0.8345459840054148
This case prompted us to consider new aspects of the pathogenesis, clinical entity and treatment of this rare bullous disease of childhood.	1.1049730374614435
Systemic administration of strontium-89 is an important option for pain relief in advanced prostate carcinoma with multiple osseous metastases.	0.9595746593884915
Recently, rhenium-186-HEDP was introduced as a new substance which has important advantages (shorter physical half-life, scintigraphic imaging, dose distribution).	1.0908687523558624
The myelosuppressive effect can be estimated more accurately in advance, so that adverse effects can be reduced and the treatment can be repeated after a shorter period of time and more often.	1.1271601727227785
Our study comprises 15 treatments with rhenium-186-HEDP in advanced prostate cancer patients using the 1.4- to 2-fold standard dose.	1.1666050088507904
The response rate, estimated as reduction in pain and increase in patient mobility, was 87 % with no major myelosuppressive effects.	1.297326587668936
The mean duration of pain relief was 4-6 weeks.	1.0264035515754328
All four patients with repeated therapy were also responding to the second treatment.	1.0342645648945203
Radionuclide therapy for painful osseous metastases with rhenium-186-HEDP appears to be an effective and, even at higher doses, safe procedure.	1.1079677732777677
Cyclophosphamide is a potent immunosuppressive drug which is widely used to treat renal and central nervous system manifestation of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).	0.8574152875027483
It is employed especially to prevent renal failure in lupus nephritis.	0.8527777722087672
Within the last decade intravenous cyclophosphamide bolus therapy has become the standard therapy in severe SLE due to its tendency towards a higher efficacy and fewer side effects as compared to oral application.	1.1397468469334002
Studies on the slightly more cost-effective oral cyclophosphamide bolus therapy have recently been published, however, there are no data on long-term results yet.	1.1041721002880218
Here, we review the effects and side effects of cyclophosphamide as well as recent clinical studies on cyclophosphamide bolus therapy in SLE.	1.160437395655853
Because of the possible side effects, especially the high risk of malignancies, which sharply increases at a cumulative dose of approximately 60g, cyclophosphamide should be used cautiously.	1.159760718373435
Cyclophosphamide bolus therapy should only be performed in hospitals with special experience.	0.9536505035491226
The optimal time to perform acute ACL reconstruction with respect to arthrofibrosis is discussed.	0.9638723017103303
Most authors prefer delayed surgery.	0.4986976455400254
The definition of the term "acute" varies between 48 hours and 4 weeks.	0.9479468149748604
In this study the limit was set at 60 hours.	1.0682201155862374
Acute ACL reconstruction was performed in 39 patients and delayed surgery in 35 after they had regained full ROM.	0.9205678026898705
The incidence of arthrofibrosis was not higher in the acutely operated group whereas overall inability to work was 44% lower in this population.	1.0572877260406444
When the indication is clear, we think that acute ACL reconstruction may be performed within 60 hours without a higher risk of postoperative development of arthrofibrosis.	1.063646607966528
Nowadays, this strategy should also be considered for economic reasons.	1.1898777284517552
After some introductory remarks on the influence of psychosocial risk factors on the developmental outcome of premature infants this review summarizes the current knowledge about intervention programs for prematures and their parents with a special focus on parent-centered programs.	1.0404423933237612
Positive effects of intervention programs are found in an improvement of cognitive development, parental sensitivity and the home environment.	1.0127465768851476
Only parent-centered interventions enhanced the quality of parent-infant interaction.	0.8188263588733006
It is questioned if those effects are also reliable for very premature infants and are found in the long term.	0.9374331021956249
Further programs should focus on parent- and parent-infant centered interventions.	0.9071935433646439
Methodological problems of intervention studies and further research perspectives on parent-centered interventions are discussed.	0.910587014797764
The surgical therapy of the rupture of a distal biceps tendon and a modified postoperative treatment is described.	1.0698956993218098
Mainpoint is the early treatment in anaclisis of Kleinert as it is standardized in the treatment of ruptures of the flexor tendons of the hand.	1.022103046502157
A forearm orthesis with a simply ROM-joint without reboundmechanism was used.	0.7025385436977706
Possible benefits are shown and further industrial evolution seems to be indicated.	0.8168826395192486
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMP) are involved in important processes of tumor invasion and metastasis.	0.9984327316594803
In the study presented, matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) and 3 (MMP3), the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1) and the complex MMP1/TIMP1 were measured by ELISA tests specific for these proteins in blood plasma.	1.2731717255024972
These components have been investigated in prostate cancer patients (PCa) with metastases (n = 18; T2, 3, 4 pN1, 2M1), prostate cancer patients without metastases (n = 29; T2, 3 pN0M0), patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH; n = 29) and in healthy men (n = 35).	1.319454415832137
Mean values of MMP1 and of the complex MMP1/TIMP1 were not different among the four groups.	0.9102583686518884
The mean values of MMP3 and especially TIMP1 were significantly higher in prostate cancer patients with metastases compared with controls, BPH patients and prostate cancer patients without metastases.	0.9997081913779173
Ten of these 18 patients had TIMP1 levels higher than the upper reference limit.	0.8976861887817328
TIMP1 concentrations correlate to the tumor stage but not to the tumor grade.	1.097177444590272
These results indicate, that TIMP1 could be an potential marker for metastases in prostate cancer patients.	1.0585129948893415
The interventional occlusion of atrial septal defects still represents an experimental approach.	0.8338156031284427
As in all intracardiac implants able the double umbrella device (ASDOS) is affected by late complications, particularly when involving umbrella thrombosis and umbrella dislocations.	1.0659665017454898
The demonstration of 4 case reports shows that late postinterventional complications can manifest in unspecific cardial and noncardial symptoms in patients with an ASDOS device.	0.9081607605119918
The diagnosis of a late complication was in all cases confirmed by transesophageal echocardiography and represents an indication for immediate surgical explantation.	1.1746617328373847
For early diagnosis and safe handling of late complications after ASDOS implantation the knowledge of the emergency physician about postinventional problems of this device is essential.	1.0860483203597597
Every ASDOS patient who is suspected of suffering from late postinterventional complications should undergo immediate transesophageal echocardiography.	0.8878743557142696
The emergency physician should get in touch with the implantation center immediately.	0.8708069794224536
Furthermore, the concept of interventional occlusion therapy of atrial septum defects needs further development to avoid late complications.	0.9731045327159629
The goal of cardiocerebral resuscitation is to return to the pre-arrest level of neurological function and to reintegrate the patient into his former social circumstances.	0.9692461772095345
This study evaluated the long-term outcome of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in a country-area.	1.1304443793266896
The economic burden of congestive heart failure is significant.	0.760103424104695
Approximately 1 to 2% of total health care expenditure is attributed to the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of congestive heart failure.	1.1579560938695181
A great share of this expenditure is related to the costs of long-term complications and productivity losses.	1.0387918493972463
In order to manage these costs, providers and policymakers increasingly have to focus on economicaly attractive interventions.	0.822371538370206
Teleconsultation is a consultation between two or more physicians about the diagnostic work-up and therapeutic strategy in the treatment of an individual case by means of modern telematics.	1.0979264576069616
Due to more complex therapeutic strategies and legally defined formal requirements, the need for teleconsultation will increase significantly in the future.	1.00912313304134
Rapid technical improvements in telematics will progressively facilitate the practical performance of teleconsultation (based upon an ISDN network in the beginning, later on by the use of a national health network).	0.9391168456113158
The medicolegal aspects of teleconsultation have already been defined sufficiently for use in surgery.	0.8238992425298203
However, the question of adequate financial compensation for this type of medical service is still unclear.	1.0568861260030744
All 459 surgeons and orthopedists in private practice in Berlin (approx.	0.7044844510750259
3.5 Million inhabitants) were contacted in March 1997 and asked to cooperate.	1.1194230963764666
An 18-point questionnaire was sent out to record the physician's experience with atraumatic and posttraumatic neck complaints, which was returned by only 112 (25%).	1.0179307966338011
According to their assessment these physicians treated ca.	0.7597267621818237
47 000 atraumatic patients with cervical complaints and ca.	0.7304315336389356
7800 with a history of a preceeding trauma over a 12-month-period (1996).	0.9256985655580581
All responders had treated patients with posttraumatic complaints; about 60% stated having treated between 20 and 60 patients per year, 25% a smaller and 15% a greater number of patients.	1.233149142943334
The average treatment time was stated to be 2-5 weeks by 60% of the physicians, 10% listed a peak of 6-7 weeks and another 10% in excess of this peak.	1.274329631710282
Half of the physicians stated having also treated patients with a cervical trauma not caused by another person (a total of 500 cases).	1.1830389379338249
Symptoms/findings were considered as specific for a traumatic origin by ca.	0.9005607380615637
50% of the physicians and as nonspecific by the other half.	1.1662968491585413
It is noteworthy that the physician's point of view was influenced by personal accident experience (accident as a car passenger): 54% of the 26 physicians with posttraumatic cervical complaints considered these symptoms to be traumaspecific compared to only 35% of 40 physicians with accidents but without cervical symptoms.	1.0914970610165968
The statement that financial gains are frequently a motivating factor for patients that influenced the symptoms and course was confirmed by 22% of the physicians without accident experience compared to 62% of the physicians with accidents without cervical involvement.	1.1497701414571806
Of the physicians 32% were already familiar with personal cervical complaints in middle age unrelated to trauma and another 18% considered them sometimes a disease parameter.	1.1148268497413087
The "subject physician" in the context of "whiplash injury" is not yet sufficiently investigated but seems to be an interesting topic of further research.	1.2872647147723093

The paper reminds of the many psychiatrists, neurologists, and pathologists connected with scientific work in neuropathology who were expelled from Germany between 1933 and 1939 because of defamation by the Nuremberg Laws or because of their political opposition.	0.9455078247303432
Many of these colleagues saw their only way out as suicide.	0.7673643740573223
Short biographies give an orientation about the destiny of the expelled physicians in their host countries.	0.8602674524684623
The effort made after 1945 to give these emigrated colleagues again an adaequate position in Germany have not been very intensive.	0.8317476994298826
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used as a diagnostic tool for special indications in oral and maxillofacial surgery.	0.9035216504206517
We describe a new MRI technique that presents images in a panoramic view analogous to orthopantomography.	0.9269011521390091
This technique is based on three-dimensional T1- and T2-weighted sequences.	1.0264260548465776
The familiar panoramic view in MRI provides better orientation and makes diagnosis faster and easier.	0.7535047320039562
However, the acquisition time is long (6-12 min per sequence), with a correspondingly high risk of motion artifacts.	1.3783784103405936
Moreover, the final workup is also time-consuming.	0.9974583327619081
These restrictions could be overcome by progress in hardware and software.	0.7093296377049619
There are promising indications for dental MRI.	0.6592528419309652
During recent years home ventilation has been shown to be useful for a growing number of patients with neuromuscular diseases and respiratory insufficiency caused by weakness of the respiratory muscles.	1.0840475596640633
Despite its technical simplicity, home ventilation leads to a number of social, ethical, medical and infrastructural problems.	0.9518331771441049
This consensus paper discusses the special situation of patients with neuromuscular diseases in home ventilation and describes the current thinking in the following topics: (1) definition of home ventilation; (2) aims of home ventilation; (3) indications and preconditions of home ventilation; (4) techniques and forms of home ventilatory support; (5) preparation for and practical questions of home ventilation; (6) stopping home ventilation.	1.045611546637829
Pseudo-obstruction of the colon is characterized by a massive colonic dilatation without mechanical obstruction.	0.8835483780932855
It is rarely after hip surgery, however, untreated it may be complicated by a life threatening perforation of the colon.	1.0721282732574733
In a retrospective analysis we reviewed 11 patients (4 women, 7 men, mean age 75.2 years, range 67 to 86 years) with pseudo-obstruction of the colon after hip surgery in the years 1995 to 1998.	1.2806722218595519
In relation to all patients aged 65 years and older who underwent surgery of the hip, the prevalence was 1.06%.	1.259418465897077
The leading clinical symptom was abdominal distension.	0.6445121790776291
On plain x-rays, dilatation of the colon measured 13.3 cm on average (9-16 cm).	1.106827384729119
In two patients (18%) adaequate application of drugs stimulating the gastro-intestinal motility was sufficient, whereas in 8 patients (73%) colonoscopic decompression had to be performed.	1.087246415901826
In three of these, the procedure failed and because of persistent symtoms a coecostomy was performed.	1.0646780390464643
One patient underwent immediate laparotomy because of peritonitis.	0.6780255099408964
2 patients (18%) died because of a complicated course.	1.0522116105484844
Non operative treatment should not exceed 24 hours, endoscopic decompression and tube placement is considered as the treatment of choice.	1.0161544861801233
In cases of failure of these procedures, perforation of the colon and/or peritonism, urgent laparotomy with open decompression by a coecostomy is essential.	0.9851056549865937
Anti-semitism increased from year to year in Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945.	0.7149035689349256

Couples often committed suicide together.	0.4635575905504934
At the end of World War II, the head of the dermatological department of the Prague University committed suicide.	1.022078995419574
We assume the same happened in Rostock and Dresden.	0.6565559866976559
The president of the German Dermatological Society (DDG) committed suicide on March 27, 1945.	0.8540723488328591
The motives of these dermatologists were obviously the collapse of Nazism and the fear of relatiatory measures.	0.8497584066506637
Biocoral is a biomaterial derived from natural corals, and it has surgical applications.	1.013775075875363
Since 1992 the author has been using this material as a bone graft substitute in maxillofacial surgery.	0.8749000357140457
Seventy-seven clinical implantations were done for different indications.	0.8379762704631767
The results suggest that coral grafts are well tolerated and become partially ossified when the calcified skeleton is resorbed.	0.863841144483788
This material has been demonstrated to be successful.	0.9035316296672371
Aim: An overview on the evidence-based indications for an immunosuppressive treatment with azathioprine in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases is given.	1.2287187908506159

Introduction: It was our aim to evaluate the results of laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal hernia repair (TAPP) with regard to recurrent hernias treated in our department.	1.3557180482197349
Methods: Included were 276 operations for first or subsequent recurrence of inguinal hernia previously treated with suture repair.	0.9970257056663675
All final repairs were carried out using the TAPP technique.	0.6054782878988058
The data were collected prospectively.	1.005114139946627
The patients were examined 2 weeks and 1 year postoperatively.	1.1956547914487514
The rate of follow-up amounted to 78.1 % at 1 year after operation.	1.0774856154357986
Results: Perioperative complications were monitored prospectively and divided into intraoperative, minor and major.	1.0993785702583247
The overall complication rate amounted to 9 %, major complications 5.3 %.	1.0384532387975913
The re-recurrence rate was 0.4 %.	0.692280018840256
Conclusions: Because of the general advantages of laparoscopic surgery and the low recurrence rate we prefer laparoscopic hernioplasty using the TAPP technique.	1.0327318157810073
Diseases of the hindfoot are associated with considerable functional impairment and therefore may hamper patients' movements during gait considerably.	0.9872154677304008
Because of biomechanical overload, articular structures, tendons and ligaments are prone to early degenerative changes during the course of rheumatic diseases as visible with plain film radiography, sonography (US), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).	0.9307652802756362
Findings may occur as arthritis of major joints or in the form of fibroostitis and bursitis of the os calcis.	0.9939917829633123
Despite the progressive course of rheumatic diseases and characteristic imaging findings, high variability of X-ray signs may occur.	1.0297795752829382
Plain film radiograms and high-resolution ultrasonography play a key role in imaging rheumatic diseases of the hindfoot.	1.0061158396548633
MRI supports imaging diagnosis in selected cases.	0.6020905609593274
The principal goals of diagnostic imaging are precise and reproducible documentation of morphologic abnormalities and differentiated analysis for planning proper conservative or surgical treatment.	0.8447252814150862
Background: We evaluated the prevalence of the loss of visual acuity due to loss of the central portion of the visual field and foveolar fixation in the first week after glaucoma filtering surgery.	1.1832725295542807
The aim of the present study was to test polylactic acid material as a controlled release carrier for polypeptide growth factors.	0.9516935052847191
Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was incorporated into DL polylactic acid (PLA) pellets under hyperbaric CO2 pressure in two different ways.	0.8892589434899459
(1) Lyophilized bFGF was crushed and mixed with PLA granules, filled into cylindric moulds of 5 x 3 mm, and submitted to hyperbaric CO2 pressure.	0.8488806076569156
(2) Lyophilized bFGF was reconstituted in phosphate buffer, mixed with PLA granules, and relyophilized.	0.8986314153814614
In vitro assessment of bFGF release from the PLA implants by immunoassay showed that loading of PLA with crushed lyophilized bFGF resulted in a rapid and high release, while loading by solubilized bFGF and relyophilization led to a low and more regular release of the polypeptide growth factor.	0.9484205125679506
Intestinal neuronal dysplasia (IND) was initially described as a developmental abnormality of the submucous plexus in children.	1.0155172672173718
In recent years this abnormality has also been observed in adults with chronic constipation.	1.0163076487794436
The aim of this study was a morphometric characterization of this disease.	0.9182798965823681
The investigation was performed with 10 adults with IND, compared with 10 healthy control probands.	1.084629089795121
The best diagnostic indicator of IND proved to be the detection of 6-10 giant ganglia with more than 7 nerve cells in 15 biopsy sections.	1.093642433697895
IND is an interesting cause of chronic constipation which can be histologically verified.	0.989288804083573
Extracorporal shock-wave application (ESWA) has been used in the treatment of stones located in the kidneys, bile, pancreas and the glandula parotis.	0.7315218816460285
In the last 2 years several studies have shown the benefit of ESWA in the treatment of soft-tissue disorders and tendinosis calcarea.	0.8891707258715396
To date, the exact mechanism is unknown.	0.9493194494636187
Local hyperemia following damage or afferent inhibition is discussed.	0.6385429618350844
The possibilities and indications of ESWA with respect to several syndroms are presented.	0.9056569710674272
The results show the benefit of ESWA in the treatment of chronic soft-tissue disorders without severe side effects.	1.0667617492058772
Some patients showed small subcutaneous hematomas and erosion of the skin when energies about 20 mJ were used.	0.9510795268091257
Forty-seven of 84 of the patients obtained complete relief; 24 patients showed a marked reduction in their complaints.	1.1967877359130008
In only 13 of 84 cases was the treatment unsuccessful.	0.8529306320264898
Up to now there are no facts concerning the loosening rate of the cemented titanium stem (Trios).	0.9701153416926375
The central guiding canula and the longitudinal drilled stem shall ensure a symmetric cement mantle.	0.7368424737021968
Management of laryngeal carcinoma located at the anterior commissure remains controversial.	0.7964242409023745
Local control rates with radiotherapy or surgery are not as good as those seen after treatment of midcord lesions.	0.9750859390968408
The vertical partial laryngectomy with epiglottic reconstruction (VPLER) may be a more successful approach to such lesions.	1.0357878062144403
The charts of all patients treated for larynx carcinoma between 1991 and 1996 at the authors' institutions were reviewed to identify those patients treated with VPLER as described by Sedlacek in 1965, Kambic in 1976 and Tucker in 1979.	1.0745154916843644
Indications for performing surgery and outcome data of patients were collected and analyzed according to the indications for surgery, surgical technique, perioperative complications, oncological outcomes and functional results.	1.1729171815617532
Twelve patients were identified that had been treated with VPLER.	0.9686998250651248
Indications for surgery included five patients with local recurrences following endoscopic laser partial laryngectomies, four cases with previously untreated primary tumors at the anterior commissure (T2 N0-2 M0), two with local recurrences following radiotherapy, and one with recurrence following frontolateral partial laryngectomy.	1.2474294943804327
There were no postoperative complications except for one laryngocutaneous fistula that required secondary repair.	0.962498939979091
All patients were able to swallow at the tenth postoperative day.	0.8332689190214593
All had their tracheostomies closed after completion of wound healing, (a mean of 17 days after surgery).	1.1093691430029573
Phonatory results were usually poor.	0.6316283392321517
Two local recurrences occurred during the follow-up period.	0.7107115636244381
However, both patients were salvaged with total laryngectomies and have since been free from disease.	1.2937033123268729
All other patients are alive and well.	0.687386186110303
Our findings show that VPLER is an effective surgical approach for carcinoma at the anterior commissure of the larynx that cannot be adequately managed with transoral laser surgery or simple frontolateral partial laryngectomy.	0.93727657779702
This study demonstrates that the procedure can be successfully applied to the treatment of local recurrences following initial raditherapy or surgery.	1.1623573205696758
No major complications occurred in our study.	0.9194556806434188
Traditionally, intra-vitam diagnosis of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) of brain supplying arteries is a domain of conventional selective angiography.	1.0103447280720845
We are aware of only two publications reporting of ultrasound displayed intimal and medial variants of carotid artery FMD, in one case each.	0.9585181094096661
We present a patient in whom color-coded duplex-sonography revealed a web-like carotid artery bulb stenosis meeting the specific criteria of a subtype of intimal FMD.	0.9076908877067766
The relationship between depression and the outcome of low back surgery was investigated.	1.0485205715083457
Data analysis was based on two assumptions: (1) Presurgical assessments of depression are correlated with the outcome of surgery, and, therefore, depression can be interpreted as a risk factor for surgical failure.	0.9243560835695956
(2) Postsurgical assessments of depression are correlated with the outcome of surgery, and therefore, depression can be interpreted as a response to treatment failure.	1.0205111020369106
The sample was made up of 78 patients who had undergone lumbar nucleotomy and 132 patients with lumbar spondylodesis.	0.9126905836700265
Treatment outcome was evaluated 6 months after surgery in the nucleotomy group and 9 months after surgery in the spondylodesis group.	0.95412250572715
Depression was assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).	0.7736875532848273
Measures of treatment outcome were an objective rating system for the surgical result, functional impairment, return to work, subjective estimations of the patient, and pain intensity.	1.1554863697968873
Presurgical depression scores showed no significant relationship with surgical outcome in nucleotomy patients.	0.9411936481538067
In spondylodesis patients, however, there was a significant negative correlation with the patients' subjective outcome ratings.	1.2361049182594048
Postsurgical depression scores, on the other hand, were significantly related to almost all of the outcome variables in both treatment groups.	1.1197486960413852
Patients with clinically relevant postsurgical depression scores were significantly more likely not to benefit sufficiently from surgery than those with clinically not relevant depression scores.	1.0382754518670245
Our findings favour assumption 2 over assumption.	0.5786908461885714
In the light of our findings, depressiveness is interpreted as a response to a non-beneficial outcome of surgery.	0.8795561329021434
The need for an interdisciplinary approach combining psychological counseling or treatment and physical therapy for those patients who do not benefit from surgery is discussed.	0.9257857239402564
Using electron-beam computed tomography (EBCT) with short exposure times of 100 or 50 ms and the capability of acquiring up to 2 x 17 images/s it is possible to study most of the important morphological and functional determinants of the heart.	1.1270041294955455
Various examples of studies in acute and chronic cardiac diseases are shown to demonstrate the use of EBCT to determine quantitatively left ventricular volumes (ml), myocardial mass (g), wall thickness changes over the cardiac cycle (mm/s), myocardial perfusion (ml/100 g/min) and the extent of coronary calcification (calcium score) and qualitatively the state of the proximal 4-6 cm of the subepicardial coronary arteries.	1.2522973404469653
The knowledge of these determinants seems very useful in excluding cardiac dysfunction, in the early recognition of cardiac disease and in the evaluation of the haemodynamic severity of coronary artery stenotic lesions.	1.1758005339535422
Further interdisciplinary studies are necessary to assess the clinical validity of these cardiac determinants, especially myocardial perfusion, using this advanced CT technology.	1.0993326400294052
Fractures and dislocations of the elbow are some of the most common injuries in childhood and adolescence.	1.2084217226471086
The majority occur in sport and play activities, e. g., a fall from gymnastics apparatus or a bike, or from popular sports items, such as skateboards or in-line skates.	0.9944107211345427
The injuries can be divided into pure dislocations of the joint and fractures of the distal humerus, proximal radius and ulna, or combinations of both.	1.1966102220859287
In addition, extra- and intraarticular fracture types are defined, with the latter as partial or complete joint lesions.	1.1966705365302903
Dislocations of the elbow joint or the radial head can occur as single injuries or in combination with a fracture.	1.0632505275441222
Supracondylar fractures and avulsion fractures of the medial epicondyle are the most frequent extraarticular lesions of the distal humerus.	1.231307029484537
Fractures of the lateral condyle prevail is incomplete intraarticular lesions.	0.9039922208973614
In the forearm, radial head and neck fractures are predominant while typical and atypical Monteggia injuries have a special status.	1.018236751981423
The complex joint construction and the age-dependent appearance of the epiphyseal ossification centers sometimes make a correct radiological diagnosis difficult.	1.016769943834801
The trauma history and an exact, clinical examination help to verify the injury, as do comparative X-ray studies of the uninjured side when necessary (but not routinely).	1.1854366958072986
Unlike other anatomical areas, most elbow injuries - even in the growing skeleton - are treated operatively.	1.3192987274209667
Hereby, the growth plates have to be respected using minimal amounts of small implants.	1.0603689747304106
Additional immobilization in a cast for 2 - 4 weeks is necessary in most cases but does not lead to a functional deficit - in contrast to adults.	1.2499057263650857
The implants should be removed as early as possible.	0.5603237788464144
Despite all therapeutic efforts, a significant number of late sequelae, such as malunions and functional impairment, can be seen.	1.164540486978005
The rate of long-term complications increases in cases of untreated displacement of fragments or joint instability.	1.0430900927119244
Corrective measures are performed only in selected cases and after the growth plates are closed.	1.0817264321213202
Our own treatment regime is demonstrated using exemplary clinical cases of the different injuries and the results of a long-term follow-up study on sports injuries of the elbow in children.	1.2432955928313778
Errors in diagnosis and therapy, as well as possible complications, are pointed out.	0.93074229534686
2-adrenergic agonists, mimicking the action of the inhibitory transmitter norepinephrine, cause antinociception due to postsynaptic inhibition of spinothalamic projection neurons, presynaptic inhibition at the central nervous system termination of primary sensory nerves, presynaptic inhibition of brainstem noradrenergic neurons and a generalized decrease in central nervous system sympathetic efferent activity.	0.9381949247433418
There is a mutual potentiation of antinociceptive effects of clonidine and morphine.	0.8204586375895789
Clonidine is used in chronic pain states for treatment of neuropathic, neuralgic and deafferentiating pain.	1.0275840528088374
Based on a meta-analysis of the studies published in the years 1996-1996, the therapeutic efficacy of systematically administered clonidine was evaluated in chronic pain states.	1.2444295166985169
Out of 403 screened published studies, only 9 fulfilled the selection criteria.	0.9444968290017588
Besides three case reports with successful clonidine treatment, four placebo-controlled studies could be analyzed treating the following chronic pain states: chest pain despite normal coronary angiograms; painful diabetic neuropathy; postherpetic neuralgia; hyperalgia in patients with sympathetically maintained pain and chronic low back pain.	1.0427264457336138
Although three studies demonstrated statistically significant improvement in pain scores, the improvement in pain relief in these cases was slight.	1.2358120450997012
Long-term treatment was successful in a few responders over a period of 17 months.	1.2863782264326538
Hyperalgesia caused by sympathetically maintained pain was relieved by topical (transdermal) application of clonidine.	0.8354207742437064
Based on this evaluation a grade C recommendation is derived, which relates to responders.	1.037554245134876
Successful treatment is expected only in pain states with increased sympathetic nervous system activity.	0.8962378108192696
Therefore, in chronic pain, treatment with systemic clonidine is of no significant value.	1.3285263625191697
Study objective: To investigate whether automatic tube compensation (ATC) or conventional pressure support (PS) is suit- able to compensate for the work of breathing imposed by the breathing circuit without altering the breathing pattern.	1.030574000886641
DNA-based prenatal testing of the fetal genotype was performed in a family at risk for recurrence of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB).	0.951564136027028
DNA from cultured fibroblasts and leukocytes from the peripheral blood of the previously affected offspring, DNA from parental leukocytes and DNA from fetal tissue obtained by chorionic villus biopsy was analysed by direct PCR amplification of known polymorphic regions within or flanking the type VII collagen gene, the canditate gene in RDEB.	0.9616853682600762
One flanking marker (D3S2/MspI) as well as two intragenic polymorphisms (C7/MspI, C7/Eco0109I) in exons 30 and 84 were informative in this family.	0.8949914221408716
Thus, based on the haplotype analysis and the lack of evidence for locus heterogeneity in RDEB, a phenotypically healthy child was predicted.	1.1013824535077401
This prediction was confirmed by the birth of a healthy female infant.	0.8769474644484772
The study reports successful determination of the fetal genotype by PCR-based prenatal diagnosis in a family at risk for recurrence of severe RDEB.	1.0018797589732296
Endothelins are peptides with powerful vasoconstrictor and mitogenic properties.	0.6061398579244661
It has become evident that endothelins are involved in many regulatory mechanisms of the circulation role both in short and in long term.	1.074905205153677
However, in many cases it remains unclear whether the alteration of the endothelin metabolism is a primary pathology or a secondary phenomenon.	1.266259456201986
The synthesis of endothelin receptor antagonists and animal models with altered endothelin metabolism have opened a new era of endothelin research that will allow insight into the mechanisms of endothelin-action and eventually might lead to new therapeutic concepts.	0.949646284644741
This review discusses the evidence both in favor and against pathogenic effects of endothelins in cardiovascular disease.	0.8543719711441479
The combination of fast MR sequences and rapid i. v. injection of paramagnetic contrast media provides information on cerebral perfusion.	0.9458324341834247
MR-perfusion imaging primarily depicts the relative cerebral blood volume.	0.7618353339364364
The aim of this study was to test whether MR-perfusion imaging with a clinical MR scanner using a standard 2D-FLASH sequence provides clinically relevant information on patients with cerebrovascular diseases and brain tumors.	1.0709991300535626
Brain infarctions, lesions in cerebral microangiopathy and occlusions of the carotid artery with very poor collateralization showed definite differences in perfusion imaging compared with normal controls.	0.9709728310752427
However, our results show that acceleration of the imaging sequence and optimization of the contrast bolus and data processing are prerequisites for the clinical use of this method, which in principle may provide information on the absolute cerebral blood volume and even blood flow.	1.2595833766976943
Lumbar Microdiscectomy requires special instruments and provides a good view with a narrow approach.	0.8320675449965849
The microscope is the best surgical aid.	0.8715546211620393
Alternatives are a retractorintigrated light or headlamp.	0.6115642732496523
A specific complication of lumbar microdiscectomy - the wrong level - can be minimized by an exact preoperative planning.	1.2579548300341783
Other complications like dural lesions and exessive bleeding are less frequent with the microscope because of the better view.	0.8975476194925024
The most severe complications that can occur with any lumbar disc operation, major vessel or visceral injury, can be avoided by lusing the new rongeur with a depth guard.	1.104908761295353
From January 1987 to March 1994 three hospitals in the city of Magdeburg treated a total of 103 subcutaneous Achilles tendon ruptures operatively.	0.9164694739233507
We created a special score to compare the outcome of the different operation techniques used.	1.139060148959269
Important aspects of the follow-up examination were isokinetic measuring of power and staying power by means of a KIN-TREX dynamic measuring device and the clinical check-up in comparison with the histological results and the patients' history.	1.256690223647647
Degeneration could only be proved histologically in 38,8 % of the cases.	0.9085872114637641
The average score of all OP methods applied was 767 of possible 1000 points.	0.7528822092832843
The adaptation suture (781 points), Silfverskiold's technique (772 points) and the fibrin adhesive technique (754 points) showed approximately the same results.	1.19794799980791
The theory that all of the ruptures have a histological degeneration background seems to be wrong.	0.939566592399101
Isokinetic measuring can be very helpful in preparing a postoperative regimen to find the optimum load.	0.9170881505438708
To determine wether a somatic dysfunction of head joints depends from segmental muscle strain, we investigated 89 patients before, during and after general anesthesia.	1.05010785412586
We examined the disturbed joint motion as exclusive criterion for a somatic dysfunction, because through an anesthesia with endotracheal intubation including complete neuromuscular blockade segmental influences on the inspected joint were eleminated.	0.9790843960096217
For complete muscle relaxation as required for orotracheal intubation a non depolarizising muscle relaxant was used.	0.8199924922842593
Somatic dysfunctions were found most frequent for side-inclination and retroflexion in segment O/C1.	0.7889074269582106
Both before as well as during complete neuromuscular blockade could be found in the majority of examinations (89,1 %) similar restraints of joint motions.	1.1990642050747922
To 10,9 % were found, that somatic dysfunctions established before the muscle relaxant was applicated, were no more demonstrable under complete blockade of neuromuscular transmission.	1.1794076179058157
Different theoretical models are presented for the interpretation of our results.	0.9404441878268641
We assume, that the disturbance of one component of the metamer organized segment is the basic phänomenon of somatic dysfunction.	0.9745305914346668
This disturbance break through the spinal segmental inhibition and expand into the segment.	0.7501626270569431
Subsequently we discuss to replace the term "somatic dysfunction" through "segmental dysfunction" and to define it as increasing of nozizeptive afference in the segment over a determined period of time with breakthrough of the spinal segmental inhibition threshold.	1.1310889266331499
Postoperative intestinal atonia is a complication which is likely to occur in patients predisposed for constipation and in patients after intra-abdominal operations.	1.0715273455284684
The postoperative delay of bowel movement, however, is often also related to the type of anaesthesia being used.	0.9528195580887302
In order to evaluate the magnitude of an anaesthetic-induced postoperative delay of bowel movement, two types of intravenous-based anaesthesia using fentanyl/midazolam (1 mg/25 mg; dosage 0.1 ml/kg/h), and ketamine/midazolam (250 mg/25 mg; dosage 0.1 ml/kg/h) respectively were compared with a volatile anaesthetic technique (enflurane; mean concentration 1.5 vol%).	1.03252441504868
In three groups of patients (each n=15) undergoing elective surgery of the lower extremities, induction of anaesthesia was accomplished with methohexital (1 - 1.5 mg) followed by succinylcholine (1.5 mg/kg) to facilitate intubation.	1.1618574663934127
For the maintenance of muscle relaxation vecuronium bromide was used.	0.7033238894575358
All patients were given droperidol to prevent postoperative emesis, and they were artifically ventilated with N2O/O2 (60: 40) to normal end-expiratory CO2 concentrations.	1.270233618832279
No anticholinergic agents were used at the end of operation since they are known to interfere with bowel motility.	0.9165295249758847
In order to determine gastro-intestinal motility, the H2 exhalation test was used.	1.0845500540413944
For this purpose 40 g lactulose in 100 ml of water was given to all patients via a gastral tube shortly before extubation.	0.9841828253844253
Lactulose is broken down by bacteria once it enters the colon, and H2 is released, taken up by the vascular system and exhaled.	0.9964051884376115
Postoperatively, patients were asked to exhale into a 20-ml syringe every 10 min.	0.8480343000246138
The content was analysed for hydrogen (ppm), using an electrochemical sensor (GMI exhaled hydrogen monitor).	1.0795656991016658
From the time of lactulose instillation to a threefold increase in endexpiratory hydrogen concentration (compared to the preoperative value), gastro-coecal transit time was computed.	1.0892828101177825
All three groups of patients were comparable in age, height and body weight.	1.102120829132729
Also, the duration of operation was comparable in all three groups.	1.091559183257315
Mean gastro-coecal transit time was 204 ( +/- 19.6 SD) min following enflurane, 302 ( +/- 32.8 SD) min following fentanyl/-midazolam and 210 ( +/- 28.8 SD) min following ketamine/midazolam anaesthesia.	0.9702258145206331
The gastro-intestinal inhibition after the opioid-based anaesthetic technique was significantly prolonged (p<0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test).	0.8624363879201797
There was no significance between patients after ketamine-based anaesthesia and those who had the volatile anaesthetic.	1.1292921701272234
When using intravenous anaesthesia with an opioid, gastro-intestinal inhibition, especially in patients prone to have constipation, is likely to develop postoperatively.	1.1265664501773678
In classical neuroleptanaesthesia and in analgosedation in the ICU, the simultaneous use of the butyrophenone droperidol seems to counteract the inhibition of opioid-related gastrointestinal motility.	1.0015511411313964
In cases of opioid-related gastrointestinal atonia a gastrokinetic compound may be necessary to overcome this effect on intestinal motility.	0.9370857422410535
In a prospective study 20 patients were monitored with serial sonograms and radiographs during distraction osteogenesis at the lower limb.	0.9813126437076246
All sonograms were obtained in four planes using a 7.5 MHz transducer.	0.9991550988518897
The distraction gap was seen as a sonolucent area in all patients after corticotomy.	1.0828508506748806
At an average of 20.7 (14-28) days after the beginning of the distraction, echogenic foci occurred and showed increasing longitudinal alignment with further distraction.	1.243161787662235
Radiographical signs of beginning mineralization were seen an average of 48.3 days after the start of the distraction.	1.1065711498989468
Exact measurement of the distraction gap was possible in all patients during lengthening.	1.1637288255400855
Bone healing complications and hematoma could be detected by ultrasound.	0.8065734493923423
A rapid increase of bone mineralization was seen after the distraction was stopped.	0.919575276169846
With increasing cortication of the regenerate bone, sonograms showed a hyper-reflecting solid line so that further mineralization and the time of removal of the fixator could not be assessed by ultrasound.	0.9865137070487238
Ultrasound is more sensitive than radiography in identifying new bone formation during distraction, measuring the length of the distraction gap, and detecting early bone-healing complications and can therefore reduce the need for radiographs.	1.0608114906872341
The interval between the onset of symptoms in patients with head and neck cancers and the introduction of treatment was evaluated.	0.9926663270343995
During a 1-year period, patients were interviewed to determine the duration of any delays from the onset of complaints until the first visit to a doctor.	1.148729801710765
Also asked was how long it took to be referred to an ENT specialist and actual referral to our department.	0.8072135501813679
We then determined the interval from diagnosis to the introduction of therapy.	1.0311065610670793
It was found that the delay of patients who went directly to an otorhinolaryngologist was shorter (median, 8 weeks) than that of patients who first went to their family doctors (median, 13 weeks) (P<0.02).	1.2627990249681467
The latter then took an additional 4 weeks before sending patients to an otorhinolaryngologist.	0.8830146023584043
Referral from the ENT specialist to our department took another 2 weeks, as well as our staging and pre-therapeutic management.	0.9202633756829371
Our findings show that the patient himself is the critical factor in delaying diagnosis and therapy.	0.9564998601289135
Tumor patients with greater professional qualification went to their doctors earlier (P<0.0001) or more often went directly to an ENT specialist (P<0.002).	1.0223052288858145
Consultations of physicians without experience in otorhinolaryngology caused yet further delays.	0.7700001406375367
The present study deals with long-term dimensional changes in cemented Müller-type total hip endoprostheses.	1.0143187798360593
Creep and wear contribute to different extents to the dimensional changes in polyethylene.	0.7516718294791392
The total amount of polyethylene wear is represented by the displacement of the femoral head into the socket.	0.8279966420734192
Within the first postoperative years, the head shifts up to a relatively high rate of about 0.5 mm per year.	1.3787600827126434
This rate diminishes after 5 years to an average of about 0.1 mm (ceramics) and 0.2 mm (metal) per year.	1.2017397631361526
Values exceeding 0.2 mm per year for the shift of the femoral head are considered to be unfavourable with regard to a probable loosening of the prosthesis.	1.0521528357158136
In this study we determined the orientation of the centre of the prosthetic head in relation to the wire marker of the polyethylene cup, comprising in all 369 total hip prostheses.	1.1400984920534067
After an average of 77 months, 96 % of the prostheses with ceramic heads (n = 109) had a wear rate of less than 0.2 mm per year.	1.1992003023560256
Using metal heads (Protasul-2 and Protasul-10) this rate could only be measured in 71 % (n = 109) of the prostheses (61.5 months).	1.2582262603412473
The combination ceramics-polyethylene produces half of the total amount of wear produced by metal-polyethylene.	0.8866200617723832
Younger patients should preferably be treated with a ceramic ballhead.	0.9825689249268819
The so-called amyopathic dermatomyositis is a rare variant of dermatomyositis which has attracted increasing interest during the last years.	0.9099910197531377
One finds the classical signs of dermatomyositis such as periorbital edema and erythema, erythematous macular and papular lesions localized at bony prominences (so-called Gottron's papules), generalized pruritus, photosensitivity, and a cutaneous histopathologic picture compatible with skin lesions of dermatomyositis.	1.0787339236635354
Crucial for the diagnosis is the exclusion of myositis by clinical examination, EMG and histology.	1.0670294432822225
Furthermore, longterm supervision of patients is advisable in order not to miss the appearance of early signs of myositis.	1.1274570062940488
The longest reported follow-up of amyopathic dermatomyositis patient is 4 years; however, it cannot be excluded that these cases will eventually culminate in classical dermatomyositis.	1.1260715097576839
In this paper we describe two cases and discuss the differential diagnosis and therapy; also, the term "Premyopathic dermatomyositis" is proposed, to indicate that the full picture is to be expected in most cases.	1.3176773852443073
The primary renal angiosarcoma is a rarely seen highly malignant tumor.	0.8896168234499257
Making a diagnosis based on histology may prove difficult.	0.6484867018059978
Because of hematogenous formation of metastases and bad prognosis in most cases we recommend that the surgical intervention be followed by the well tolerated systemic chemotherapy with Doxorubicin and Ifosfamid.	1.1374438108431464
This study compares the results of the outpatient-based program of the Cochlear Implant Center Ruhr with inpatient-based rehabilitation, which is almost exclusively performed in Germany.	1.0559435492347067
The Department of Otorhinolaryngology at the University of Essen in Germany provided 52 patients with either 22- or 24-channel Nucleus cochlear implants from March 1996 to July 1999.	1.114898786694398
Almost all patients (n=49) were rehabilitated on an outpatient basis, which is the standard in many cochlear implant centers outside Germany.	1.2207223682342225
Syringe drivers are used in anaesthetics, intensive care and emergency medicine to deliver small volumes of highly potent drugs with continuous, constant and reproducible flow.	0.9522694012817055
For early recognition of interruptions of the drug delivery caused by occlusion of the infusion system, an alarm is triggered as soon as the system pressure exceeds a certain limit.	1.0576360891492809
The sensitivity of this alarm depends on the flow rate, type-specific cut-off pressure and the elastic parameters of the infusion system.	1.1211516944145237
The sudden release of pressure built up in the system after occlusion occurred can cause delivery of an uncontrolled drug bolus and hence an additional hazard.	0.9587272020076019
Methods: Six syringe drivers that are widely used in clinical practice were tested for alarm delay and bolus delivery in the event of an occlusion in the system.	1.2064775164482877
First, the alarm pressures at flow rates of 10, 50 and 100 ml/h were measured.	1.1242630377712486
Then the alarm delay time and bolus volumes post-occlusion were assessed, using a basic infusion system (syringe+single infusion set).	0.9593262506686066
Finally, several alterations to the system like extension, tap battery with germ filters or branching were made and their impact on alarm delay and bolus volume measured.	0.9853527828143134
Results: Because of the great differences in alarm pressures between the devices tested, there were marked differences in the alarm delay at same flow rates.	1.1805224895273492
Predictably, there was an indirect proportional link between alarm delay and flow rate.	1.2157468986465239
Using the basic infusion system, alarm delays between 23 s and 143 min were measured.	0.707621887174942
In two of the tested syringe drivers, a pressure-release mechanism is activated with the pressure alarm, which prevented bolus application.	1.1874301599389558
In the other devices, release of the pressure in the occluded system caused boli of 0.5-7 ml.	1.2222855343272743
Variations in the actual syringe volume and insertion of a second connection tube had no impact on alarm delay and bolus volume.	0.862028262793873
Tap batteries, parallel running syringe drivers or trapped air in the system, however, caused marked increase in both alarm delay (107%) and bolus volume (+147%).	1.09135545630325
Discussion: Unidentified occlusions of the system cause grave malfunctioning of syringe drivers.	0.9838126255782168
While applying highly potent drugs, the discontinuation of drug delivery with subsequent bolus application can cause vital danger to the patient.	0.914055829146233
As a result of the significant time delays in the pressure alarms, the devices tested do not provide sufficient protection against unrecognized system occlusion.	1.075950633174784
Syringe drivers with adjustable alarm pressure can be set close to the actual infusion pressure.	0.8404838462151961
A further important point is that one should aim at a reduction in the elastic properties of the infusion set because of the great impact on alarm delay and bolus volume.	0.9855270668877876
Because the overall results of conservative treatment for distal radial fractures have been unsatisfactory, it is rarely used.	1.1289906672182717
However, minimally invasive methods such as stabilization by external fixation and percutaneous K-wire pinning are being increasingly used.	1.1706615464748797
A justified indication for the use of K-wire pinning is that it provides an opportunity to achieve good and very good short- and long-term anatomic and functional results.	1.0636125640063252
Short-term supplementary immobilization with a minimized plaster cast or protective external fixation is generally considered to be useful.	1.0211196842565438
Reports on plaster-free functional treatment after K-wire pinning have been published.	0.8818178554945626
The indications therefore need to be further specified.	0.8106324402150235
Follow-up studies and an analysis of our patients show a strong increase in K-wire stabilization and good-to-very good results in 75% of the cases.	1.3000322893272604
Involvment of the genitouronary tract by lymphoproliferative disorders is rare.	0.6951229483995911
Rapid proliferating Burkitt's lymphomas could mimic acute diseases.	0.5728447768663397
Due to the extreme chemosensitivity, the lymphoma is cureable and surgery should be done only for histology.	1.0196545131713755
Initial surgery should be restricted to acute abdominal complications or complete removal of localised resectable disease.	0.7843984354390716
In any case a multiagent chemotherapy is necessary.	0.7122358189844261
Wet autoclaving is a simple, reliable and time-effective method for antigen retrieval in routinely processed archival material.	0.8992121835383973
Both routine diagnostic (e. g., oestrogen and progesterone receptors, cytoskeletal proteins) and research antibodies (e. g. various p53 antibodies, mdm-2, bcl-2, MIB-1) are reported to demonstrate its application.	1.053806112919918
Wet autoclaving may allow successful application of antibodies in paraffin-embedded tissues designed for use on frozen sections.	0.857320099608304
The technique has the poten-tial to reliably handle up to 200 sections at a time, without evidence of any significant damage to the sections or nuclear morphology.	1.0555760115033672
Classical stable plate osteosynthesis with its anatomical repositioning, absolute stability between fragments and medial support should only be applied to joint fractures and spongy bone.	0.9885457172398929
In cortical bone, the anatomical reposition connected with the plate promotes bone necrosis along the fracture and prevents callus formation.	0.9950745744885283
Direct cortical synthesis, a method also known as "primary bone healing", serves the bone's revascularisation and is not necessarily aimed at healing.	1.1541623150500868
Thus, this may also be termed "necrosis healing".	1.1157338771688148
Along the shaft of long bones, elastic plate osteosynthesis, a biological method, is safer than and superior to the rigid technique.	1.0610492366372362
This even applies to short oblique and transverse fractures insofar as nailing does not appear feasible.	0.7390888602819553
Elasticity is achieved by leaving a flexible stretch of at least 2 - 4 holes, i.e.	0.9510097999528092
as long as possible, without screws over the fracture and by employing a titanium plate.	0.9573544876146288
Thus, there is no punctate fatigue leading to plate breakage.	1.0560862602721774
The fitting of third fragments is deliberately left out.	0.6208882316407696
The same applies to all kinds of compression with lag screws, tension devices or DC-gliding holes - and this with the intention of allowing micromovements in the fracture's fissure.	1.0066473351414569
Periost and muscle are not removed and the fracture is not examined.	0.9074444655531366
Healing occurs spontaneously via a fixating callus forming within the first 3 - 6 weeks out of the periost-soft tissue combination.	1.1101418564614831
Histomorphological investigation dates the first woven- bone bridges between the fragments to 3 weeks subsequent to the accident.	0.9292625201544504
In Göttingen University trauma centre, 87 fractures have been attended to over 2 years using this technique.	0.8685057768117274
Despite considerable soft-tissue damage, no delayed bone healing, pseudoarthrosis or bone infection has been observed.	0.8481290184052397
The risks of elastic plate osteosynthesis lie in unbiological and exaggerated reposition methods, too short a flexible stretch, and insufficient anchorage of the screws.	1.0597037930276374
Diagnosis of a thrombosis in the peripheral veins can now be made with almost 100% certainty using either phlebography or duplex sonography.	1.0947765468506396
A correct diagnosis depends on the expertise of the examiner.	0.7831372674392587
Both methods are available throughout Germany.	0.8649979639635942
Although both are equally suitable for primary diagnostic investigations, duplex sonography has assumed an important role due to the fact that it is not invasive.	1.130770138924347
Phlebography is vital if there are specific issues that need to be clarified.	0.7352541233678495
This applies if invasive treatment methods are being considered, if an expert opinion is required or if scientific issues need to be determined.	1.0413176261538868
Discrepancy between clinical findings and the results of duplex sonography also constitutes an important indication for phlebography.	1.022036447946208
In many institutions, both methods are used in a "golden partnership" in cases in which it is important to obtain comprehensive records.	1.2892376444272617
For frequent ventricular ectopic beats, currently, reassurance and pharmacological therapy are the mainstays of treatment.	1.0193716173775313
This study assesses the useful role of catheter ablation in eliminating frequent monomorphic ventricular ectopic beats in severely symptomatic patients.	0.8594268888402224
Catheter ablation was performed in 65 patients with frequent drug refractory ventricular ectopic beats.	0.9728080423638321
The site of origin of ventricular ectopic activity was accurately mapped by using pace mapping, earliest endocardial activation time, and unipolar mapping.	0.9703814030423126
In 5 patients a new non-contact mapping was additionally performed.	0.8794530881993434
The ectopic focus was located in the right ventricular outflow tract in 37 and in the left ventricle in 28 patients.	1.06703084828355
Ventricular ectopic beats were successfully eliminated by catheter ablation in 49/65 patients (75%).	0.8575484259551668
During a mean follow up of 13 +/- 11 months, 9 of 49 successful ablated patients (18%) had a recurrence.	1.188195757685121
Radiofrequency catheter ablation can be successfully used to eliminate ventricular ectopic activity.	0.9194910726689423
It may, therefore, be a reasonable alternative for the treatment of severely symptomatic, drug resistant monomorphic ventricular ectopic activity.	1.1144266457193832
Injuries of the forefoot are a challenge for orthopaedic surgeons.	1.0054607023862652
After healing of bone and soft tissue damage, posttraumatic metatarsalgia can persist.	0.86733727004062
The paper presents a therapy algorithm with newly designed insoles, which consist of the common orthopaedic adaptions like a rocker bottom and a stiffening of the sole.	1.0078462794234702
The therapy is shown on two cases.	0.7902344007449549
With these orthotics adequate is possible and pain relief realistic.	0.8887306703517374
Background: Myopic PRK up to 6 D is an approved and safe procedure.	1.236783267539091
The efficacy and safety of combined treatment of myopia and astigmatism in compound myopic astigmatism (PARK) have not yet been demonstrated.	0.9699406886445179
Nitric oxide (NO) can play an important role in the regulation of vascular tone and neurotransmission, as well as in non-specific immunoreactions and inflammation in a variety of tissues.	1.0122420996103565
Increased quantities of nitric oxide in respired air can be measured during inflammatory processes.	0.8248669132410823
However, the exact role and precise sources of NO under physiological and pathophysiological conditions within the airways remain to be defined.	1.0179048910821467
We report on a 55-year old patient who presented with a four month history of intermittent left thoracic painful attacks which radiated in the left arm.	1.179376087030808
Both normal 12 lead electrocardiogram and treadmill stress tests showed no significant ST changes.	0.8379985211752505
A thallium-201 scintigraphy afterwards disclosed a non-transmural septal ischemia.	0.7094377987210255
The consecutively performed diagnostic catheterization revealed a severe, almost pouch-like proximal aneurysm of the right coronary artery with a maximal diameter of 15-20 mm as well as an aneurysmatic modified left coronary artery and an impaired left ventricular function (EF 49%).	1.1044109163039029
In the absence of coronary artery stenosis, the patient was treated conservatively with an ACE inhibitor (lisinoprile 20 mg/day) under accompanying effective anticoagulant therapy with coumadin.	1.1403188501316575
With this strategy the patient has been asymptomtic during the eight month follow-up period.	0.9356386046377999
We investigated in 17 children (mean 7.1 years) the continuous administration of tramadol following augmentation cystoplasty or exstrophy reconstruction.	1.1102753937450058
Mean duration of the tramadol administration on the pediatric ward was 3.8  +/-  1.1 days (initial dosage 0.25 mg/kg/per hour, dose adjustment by the nursing staff).	1.2408153922614082
Mean tramadol consumption was 0.21 mg/kg/h on day 1 and was reduced to 0.08 mg/kg/per hour on day 4.	1.1635966176146346
Median pain score (assessed with ten-step scales) was 5 before treatment and between 2.5 (day 1) and 0.5 (day 5) during therapy.	1.3223019104504754
Lowest oxygen saturations (mean) ranged from 93.8 % to 95.2 %.	1.1518243675779114
Three patients (17.6 %) suffered from nausea/vomiting on 3 of 64 treatment days (4.7 %).	0.9830727702606943
Pruritus and extreme sedation did not occur.	0.5383771675908819
The continuous administration of tramadol is a simple and safe procedure following major urological surgery in children.	0.9101190826827908
Over the past 5-7 years, there has been a renewed research interest into the mechanism as well as the development of newer "emerging" treatment modalities for atrial fibrillation.	1.1910023149610969
One of these novel therapies is the implantable atrial defibrillator.	0.9515739080350506
In this article we will review the basic and clinical research which has been used in the development of electrode systems and shock waveforms utilized by commercially-available implantable atrial cardioversion devices.	1.0298302999368107
In 26 patients with abscesses in the maxillofacial area, the electrolyte concentrations, pH and osmotic and hydrostatic pressures of the pus fluid were measured and calculated.	0.9436231918322445
The main cations identified were sodium (134  +/-  38 mmol/l) and potassium  (37  +/-  16 mmol/l) and as anions chloride (183  +/-  46 mmol/l) and bicarbonate (10  +/-  4 mmol/l).	1.153144603137929
The pH value of the pus liquid was 6.164  +/-  0.233.	0.9513249323173208
The calculated mean osmotic pressure of the pus liquid was 7910  +/-  1455 mm Hg, whereas the measured physical pressure inside the abscess was 49  +/-  13 mm Hg.	1.034704646134853
Both pressure types show time-dependent pressure curves.	0.900635907942753
With time, the real pressure inside the abscess cavity increases, whereas the osmotic pressure decreases.	1.0562668384007836
There was no relationship between the two pressure types and the different species of microorganisms responsible for the inflammation.	1.1425833018889018
The results of the study reveal that abscesses can be regarded as osmotically active systems, and the mechanism by which the abscess is formed might be as follows.	1.2170676706603787
After penetration of virulent microorganisms into the tissue space, the area of acute inflammation is walled off by the collection of inflammatory cells.	1.0123205263448507
Destruction of tissue by products of the polymorphonuclear leucozytes takes place and results in liquefactive necrosis and a hypertonic abscess cavity.	0.8782813044074422
The inwards-directed flow of tissue fluids into the cavity via the abscess membrane causes volume expansion and generates pressure, two facts that can explain the swelling dynamics and typical symptoms of abscesses in the maxillofacial area.	0.9380807083608561
Internal mammary artery (IMA) bypass grafts have a satisfactorily long lasting blood supply to the myocardium.	0.8242467467868747
Their initial flow capacity can be insufficient with subsequent regional myocardial ischemia.	0.8117028041498779
This study represents a feasable surgical method to evaluate the effectiveness of the IMA graft function by temperature measurement of the heart during warm reperfusion after hypothermic cardioplegia.	1.0427758736758679
Twenty-five patients with multi-vessel coronary artery disease underwent coronary artery bypass grafting using the IMA as an arterial graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery and saphenous vein grafts to the remaining coronary arteries.	1.0783190796255826
Distal anastomoses were installed during cold intermittent blood-cardioplegic  arrest.	0.6941096976596111
After unclamping the aorta and IMA graft, the temperatures in cardiac front and rear sides were measured during the first five minutes of warm reperfusion.	1.0002936834755585
A sufficient IMA graft function was expressed by a typical rise of temperature: The cardiac front and rear sides showed a parabolic and exponential course, respectively.	0.9188883591056684
The rewarming speed expressed as the first derivative of temperature over time led to a sharp and early peak for the front side, and a smaller and delayed peak for the rear side.	1.128421583860514
An insufficient IMA graft function could be recognized by atypical temperature courses.	0.7654907260679823
Fabry's disease (Angiokeratoma corporis diffusum) is a rare X-chromosome linked recessive disorder belonging to the group of sphingolipoidoses.	0.971529081078461
The basic defect involves the gene encoding alpha-galactosidase.	0.7245106620073701
Because this enzyme is responsible for decomposition of glycosphingolipids, its deficiency results in their accumulation in endothelial and smooth muscle cells.	0.8938016490186657
With time, generalized angiokeratomas, paresthesias, renal and cardiac insufficiency and cerebrovascular complications develop.	0.971533709295073
We report a patient who in addition to the well-described findings also showed unique nail fold capillary changes not described so far.	1.0205238785495938
Analysis of serum concentration of alpha-galactosidase identified three female heterozygous carriers in the patient's family.	0.952632237171125
Benign, proliferative changes of the Brunner's gland are very rare and account for about 10 % of duodenal bulb neoplasias.	1.0712451022188492
The authors present a case of Brunner's gland adenoma of unusual dimensions (12 x 5 x 2.5 cm).	1.1278221993467952
The patient presented with vague epigastric discomfort as isolated symptoms.	0.5956848962123298
In this case we performed surgical treatment, including a duodenotomy and polypectomy.	1.1739911428761323
Because they are localized in the submucosa small, superficial endoscopic biopsies may fail to confirm the diagnosis.	0.7764520267172422
Malignancy seems to occur only very rarely, with only 14 cases reported in the literature.	0.9816738086908463
As the majority of Brunner's adenomas are quite small, endoscopic polypectomy will confirm the diagnosis and cure the condition in most cases.	1.119002651321463
Large symptomatic adenomas may require surgical resection.	0.6256071920865157
Objective: How does adjuvant training of strength and endurance influence the muscular, cardial, respiratory, immunological systems, and the quality of life during intrahepatical chemotherapy in a veteran athlete with liver metastasis after resection of a carcinoma of the rectum.	1.1357237234332274
Patient and method: A 58-year-old athlete with metastatic carcinoma of the rectum (pT3, N0, M-liver, G2) underwent regional chemotherapy (folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil) via an intrahepatic port system.	1.2408293397353052
Six cycles with 5 days each were applied.	0.7501715062762988
During the intervals between cycles (14 days), beginning in the 6th postoperative week, a strength and endurance training (duration 13 weeks) was carried out twice weekly with an intensity of 40-60 % of the maximum postoperative individual power and endurance (evaluated with weight and treadmill exercise tests and measurement of lactate).	1.1367580829810953
Before and after chemotherapy, an echocardiogram, resting and exercise electrocardiogram, lung function, natural killer cells and the gastrointestinal quality of life index (GLQI) was evaluated.	1.0514521160367445
After chemotherapy was finished, the effects of training were assumed.	0.9369048449389703
Results: Strength increased between 0 % and 144 %.	1.3602779062046808
Endurance improvement was measured on the last comparable submaximal intensity step, expressed by reduction of heart rate and lactate concentration by 10 and 21.5 %, respectively, improvement of lung function regarding FEV 1 and FCV by 12.9 and 11.3 %, respectively, and VC IN 11.4 %.	1.1559075940907442
The relative count of natural killer cells increased by 27.2 %, and the GLQI improved from 109 points (pathologic) to 129 points (normal).	1.0498718997320207
Conclusion: There were positive effects on muscular and cardial mechanisms of adaptation and on illness-related quality of life.	1.1433400638808662
Postoperative sports activity during regional chemotherapy is possible.	0.7515445894305172
Introduction: We report our experience with laparoscopic nephrectomy in comparison to open nephrectomy in geriatric patients.	1.1819053786350204
The laparoscopic technique is presented and the results are discussed with respect to the data from the current literature.	1.3181867312744615
Material and Methods: Since 1993, a total of 249 patient have undergone a nephrectomy for benign renal disease.	1.092202828701319
In 131 patients a laparoscopic nephrectomy (in most cases via a transperitoneal approach) was performed and in 118 patients an open nephrectomy via a flank incision.	1.1601064611768477
Clinical parameters were compared between both groups as well as with respect to different age groups.	0.9150897462591024
Results: There were no differences in terms of operative results (operative time, pre- and postoperative hemoglobin) between the laparoscopy group and open nephrectomy group as well as among the different age groups.	1.1496948000125853
Patients in the laparoscopy group demonstrated significant advantages with respect to blood loss, transfusion rate, analgesic consumption, hospital stay, and convalescence.	1.0420411569614583
These advantages were not related to patient age.	0.7444341934126103
The complication rate was comparable for both groups; however, both groups showed an elevation of the complication rate in the age groups 75 to 84 years.	1.1736512526066287
The mortality rate within the first 30 days after nephrectomy was 1.7% in the open nephrectomy group.	1.2348646225499433
Conclusions: The laparoscopic nephrectomy offers comparable operative results (with less blood loss and a lower transfusion rate) when compared to open nephrectomy.	1.1663966268540087
In terms of postoperative parameters, patients in the laparoscopy group have significant advantages.	1.0698566064994022
Especially geriatric patients benefit from these advantages and, therefore, the laparoscopic approach should be the preferred technique for a nephrectomy in these patients.	1.0324714266703379
The vast majority of adder bites among children in Germany is caused by the common viper (vipera berus).	0.9270538360539021
The venom that is applicated by the viper contains several enzymes, some of them with hemorrhagic and neurotoxic activity.	0.9236808799808277
Adder bites among children may be without any symtoms but as well may cause severe intoxication.	0.8832526762368543
The aim of this study was to evaluate the results after open Bankart repair using suture anchors in patients with recurrent posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability.	0.8851981999098192
Some 32 patients were prospectively observed for a mean of 40 months (24-60) after stabilization.	1.2467179875659828
The mean age at the time of operation was 29.7 years.	1.0063818048958233
All patients were postoperatively immobilized in a sling for 3 weeks.	1.0192520974464225
According to the criteria of Rowe, 29 patients (90.6 %) had good or excellent results.	1.0736905359605051
Two patients (6.3 %) developed recurrent instability 6-24 months postoperatively; 93.7 % were not or only slights limited in sports activities.	1.213164857680615
Bankart repair is an excellent treatment for recurrent posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability.	0.8254334821063126
The use of suture anchors is an appropriate way of reattaching the capsuloligamentous complex to the glenoid to restore stability to an unstable joint.	0.9655293769296622
Purpose: Assessment of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) patency with computed tomography methods has been demonstrated as an alternative to coronary angiography.	1.181575303303199
The evaluation of the bypass anastomoses is still of limited success.	0.8607019095956594
Prospective ECG triggering of conventional CT scanners al- lows heart phase-triggered single-slice acquisition in the sub-second range.	0.8706485888481473
The goal of this study was to evaluate whether the use of ECG triggering can optimize the evaluation of proximal CABG anastomoses.	1.0113878124279376
Multiple personality is known since last century und has been described by Breuer and Freud as well as by Kraepelin.	1.0450405722075138
In the latest and nearly exclusively angloamerican literature multiple personality disorder is included in the dissociated reactions in borderline personality disorder.	0.8450111515421749
The concept of comorbidity is criticized.	0.575941241079388
Case studies illustrate indications for diagnosing MPD.	0.6667253244323721
The authors point out, that sufficient diagnostic methods and criteria are still not existing.	1.1637687336696514
But their development has its limits: In most cases a history of sexual abuse can be detected and therefore an intensive diagnostic "investigation" can be on a psychodynamic level a repetition of traumatic abuse.	1.0898327552156364
Many new methods have been introduced in reproductive medicine in recent years, and some have already found their way into clinical routine.	1.0147097780618572
Cryopreservation of oocytes and in vitro maturation and culture of primordial follicles do not play a significant role in patient treatment.	0.9974159627568429
However, the short-term culture of oocytes before metaphase II does seem relevant.	0.967751757622677
Blastocyst culture has mostly replaced coculture techniques and, given appropriate laws, provides adequate possibility of selecting embryos with high developmental and implantation potential.	0.9403870689386666
An exact pronuclear diagnosis also has a high ability to predict the probability of implantation.	0.8943282450435339
Viewing the latest data, assisted hatching seems to bring no improvements for most patients.	0.8150373820039534
Preimplantation diagnosis is being discussed in Germany due to new statements from ethical committees.	0.9221598602896007
Cytoplasma transfer, nuclear transfer, or the transplantation of spermatogenic cells into donors are currently only experimental.	1.0013424827912352
The importance of spiral-CT is clinically accepted for diagnosing spreading disease and for making a decision about the therapy strategy for head and neck tumors.	0.4911276634169387
Its importance for follow-up after radiotherapy was examined in 26 patients with irradiated laryngeal tumors.	0.5413971412368318
Using spiral-CT multiple signs of alterations (n = 98) can be diagnosed, which are not only important for tumour relapse, but also for assessment.	0.980227795686659
Spiral-CT offers the possibility of achieviny various additional information about the larynx that cannot be obtained with laryngoscopy.	0.4802409930616585
In follow-up examinations after radiation, laryngoscopy and spiral-CT are recommended as an integrated neck examination using the breath-holding technique (separately reconstructed) and also as functional spiral-CT of the vocal cords in "I"-phonation.	0.6227970554241586
In the years 1980-1992 surveys were undertaken to ascertain the occurrence of central nervous system infections in children in pediatric departments in the German provinces of Bavaria and Lower Saxony.	1.0859476621383874
There was a very noticeable drop in viral meningitides over the survey years especially in mumps meningitis, i. e. from 199/205 in 1980 to 16/7 in 1992.	0.9318551451203398
In both states about 80 % of the viral meningitides could not be clarified etiologically.	1.118412761100411
Whereas in Bavaria a steady increase in herpes simplex encephalitides and varizella zoster encephalitides was apparent (1/4 in 1980, 10/24 in 1992), the same development was not found in Lower Saxony.	1.1736222471146955
Although the number of measles encephalitides dropped in both states during the period of the survey, up to 6 cases of the illness occurred annually.	1.1058646773024503
Only in the case of herpes simplex encephalitis the rate of recovery shows a substantial improvement over the observation period, while for other forms the rate of partial recovery has remained approximately the same.	1.1078518163912188
Purpose: To assess patient reliability and compliance, most perimeters check for false-positive and -negative answers.	1.2259842981264317
In this study the results of catch trials were obtained with video campimetry with respect to age-related changes and differences for tests using increment and decrement stimuli.	1.1275010372183325
During a 7-year period (between July 1987 and June 1994) 19 patients were treated for Chopart dislocation.	1.0126236502300807
Seventeen patients were examined clinically 48 months following trauma.	1.1451746268203415
We found 1 excellent, 6 good, 6 mediocre, and 4 poor results.	1.2385402367940872
Only 4 patients were able to achieve their pre-accident level of work and no patients could return to sports at the same level.	1.0303686043529927
In our patients, Chopart dislocation had a negative social consequence both at the work place and in recreational activities.	0.975686109184419
In long-term follow-up, the Chopart dislocation was the most debilitating injury even for polytrauma patients.	0.9633125957423971
For incidents of malignant hyperthermia (MH) outside the hospital, a high number of unrecorded cases must be reckoned with because of an insufficient knowledge of emergency services and poor identification and documentation that make it impossible to classify acute situations under the diagnosis of malignant hyperthermia crisis.	1.0435704370640209
As a result, there are no statistical data in this field, and only case reports with a broad spectrum of suspected trigger mechanisms have been published.	1.1915982418205675
The case described in this report is a proved example of a non-anesthesia-related triggering of MH in a 21-year-old man who had had an anesthetic-induced MH manifestation in childhood, which was confirmed with an in vitro contracture test.	1.1519429928839342
After visiting a restaurant, he became unconscious and convulsive after consuming a high level of alcohol (2.9permil).	0.9971668865470118
The first cardiocirculatory arrest occurred directly before hospitalization.	0.6428867178588563
After admission, the patient showed a full-blown MH episode whose subsequent fatality was unavoidable in spite of adapted and optimal therapy.	1.0920729397833582
Suspected trigger mechanisms seem to be multifactoral (excessive alcohol consumption, over-heating, mental stress) as a forensic investigation did not point to any particular signs of typical trigger substances.	1.0336387498295307
The case demonstrates again that an MH attack might be triggered under certain non-anaesthesia-related situations.	0.8656440275564279
For patients with an MH disposition, additional information on their behavior outside the hospital is required.	1.1567938587512425
Dipterous fly maggots of different species live worldwide as parasites in hoofed mammals.	0.6801473026446441

As a result of increasing tourist traffic, travelers can also bring back to Germany tropical types of myiasis.	0.8524667241043428
Surgical treatment of diffuse peritonitis is applied very variably.	0.8392555922403725
There is no question that source control is the most important treatment principle, but the role of additional treatment concepts such as continuous postoperative peritoneal lavage remains controversial.	1.2311352206074562
In a prospective survey (1993-1996) we analyzed the need for additional treatment concepts in our patient material.	1.2798323994459861
In 186 patients with diffuse peritonitis we applied the concept of source control and extensive (20-30 l) intraoperative lavage.	1.0513506975965183
Additional treatment principles such as continuous postoperative peritoneal lavage (n = 17) or staged lavage (n = 5) were applied only "on demand", namely in 20 patients (11 %).	1.1487963659773113
In 166 patients (89 %) source control of diffuse peritonitis was possible.	1.0731963906069184
The mean severity of peritonitis (n = 186) was 28.5 (range 16-43) using the Mannheim Peritonitis Index.	1.4035794386025602
The primary cause of peritonitis in our patients was perforation or leakage in the lower GI tract (52 %).	1.0013171843014892
The hospital mortality rate was 12 % in the whole group, and the postoperative morbidity rate was 34 %.	1.5221538280833848
We conclude that nowadays, using high-quality intensive care as well as modern antiinfective treatment, only a few patients (ca.	1.3386713600317
10 %) need additional therapy measures such as postoperative lavage.	0.956612945417349
Surgical source control in combination with intraoperative lavage is sufficient in most of the patients with diffuse peritonitis.	1.1623461489929936
Native Tissue Harmonic Imaging is a new way of ultrasound image processing that addresses the difficult-to-image patient.	0.9778296277432547
By using a Gaussian shaped transmit pulse it is possible to separate from the returning echo the harmonic component without overlapping with fundamental reflections.	0.9117628298522824
The improved image quality leads to higher diagnostic confidence so that the use of further imaging modalitites is unnecessary.	0.8682338485724079
Aim: The aim of this study was to validate the detection of calcified arteriosclerotic plaques with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS).	0.8680898842539825
Method: 181 arteries were examined by 20/30 MHz IVUS.	1.0309984457956625
The ultrasound cross-sections were compared to the corresponding radiologic (30 kV) and histologic cross-sections.	1.1858473429076155
Results: Calcified lesions were imaged as bright echos with shadowing.	0.8637494876878987
In 13 cases of 161 calcified lesions were too small to detect by IVUS.	0.9071050831678137
In 5 ultrasonic sections the diagnosis "calcified lesion" could not be verified neither by radiology nor by histology.	0.8392680528191387
The sensitivity was 91.6%, the specificity was 94.7% and the accuracy was 93.0%.	1.3018233540073856
Conclusions: Because of the acoustic properties of calcium, calcified lesions can be detected accurately by IVUS.	0.9241565990178955
IVUS can generate new insights into the effect of plaque composition on the response to catheter therapies.	0.7942498130969358
Hillel Klein has called the holocaust "the dark core of the twentieth century".	0.8433842659787154
It was the aim of weekly conferences, held in Israel in 1994 and 1996, to explore its repercussions on current behaviour.	1.0527962053667304
The topic was "The past in the present".	1.2240093231652034
The participants were Israelis and Germans, the staff international.	0.8795956472964531
The method used was the application of the "group relations conference", specially devised for these conferences.	1.0380951065771828
The leadership was in the hands of Eric J. Miller, director of the group relations program at the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations in London, where this group method originated and continues to be particularly cultivated still today.	0.9922614351762212
It is especially suited when an unconscious conflict between subgroups exists that emerges on the surface in forms which lead to confusion and misunderstandings.	0.9045486935354522
The task which had been put to the participants was as follows: to explore how feelings and fantasies influence relations within and between the two groups.	0.9745479420031393
This was easy to remember but not always easy to adhere to.	0.8335682984886552
There were moments when fantasy and reality got confused, accompanied by intense feelings.	0.7010109930083255
In this paper my experience with a databank for cases with bone diseases is reported.	1.086004286959437
All cases which had been diagnosed in the newly formed Department of Bone Pathology of the University of Hamburg since 1970 were registered in uniform fashion.	1.0418253518302814
Adapting the system to state-of-the-art network structures required a lot of personal and financial investment.	0.8792860332421536
This could not be accomplished by university resources alone, but only in cooperation with other research funds.	1.0442545632270956
Now 76 000 cases can be routinely accessed and scientifically analysed.	0.680993383970347
Background and purpose: In Germany, 750,000 children are born per year who should be screened for developmental visual defects in the age range 24-48 months.	1.0203286791579125
However, the established pediatric screening program is not sufficient to prevent amblyopia.	1.1211913204234858
The purpose of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of alternatives for amblyopia and microtropia screening.	0.8268259836238367
The fluorescence diagnosis based on the aminolavulinic acid-stimulated porphyrin synthesis allows the detection of superficial tumors in a very early stage even when they are very small tumors.	1.000438674311496
A fluorescence diagnosis of tumors in the oral cavity can be simply performed by rinsing with a 0.4% ALA solution for 20 min.	0.9620629102478844
This topical application avoids systemic side effects such as skin sensitization.	0.6803064348508109
The red fluorescent areas are visible to the naked eye; only a blue light source for fluorescence excitation is necessary and a suitable red filter for observation.	0.9639890815201417
In our study on 56 patients suffering from carcinoma of the oral cavity, 96% of the histologically confirmed carcinoma could be visualized via fluorescence.	1.1142270337547366
In 3 patients additional tumors were detected via fluorescence that were not visible otherwise.	0.9570459584461567
However, many patients show fluorescent areas with no correlation to the histological finding.	1.307604120258075
It was verified that bacteria from the oral cavity also produce PpIX after ALA incubation, which leads to false-positive findings.	1.0183744366044312
Reduction of the false-positive findings was achieved by rinsing the oral cavity with hydrogen peroxide and by mechanical plaque reduction.	1.0404363887840422
This improves the reliability of a fluorescence-guided biopsy.	0.8352976098124256
However, suppression of the bacteria fluorescence is necessary for clinical use of this diagnostic method.	1.3977123245107719
Autocapture is a newly developed automatic threshold tracking algorithm implemented in implantable pacemakers.	0.8042808753625001
Based on the detection of the cardiac evoked response, autocapture continuously controls the effectiveness of stimulation.	1.0236675444395253
Increases in threshold are immediately followed by an adaption of the pulse amplitude.	0.8075104928461132
Automatic threshold tests periodically lower the amplitude in order to adapt to decreased thresholds.	0.7800892183273124
Thus, changes in threshold can be monitored over a long period and utilized as a diagnostic tool.	1.1795484830602436
This case report demonstrates the diagnosis and monitoring of a microdislodgement by means of autocapture.	1.0533735737432937
The indication to treat symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is discussed controversely.	0.8785381819082883
Successful medical treatment may result in the reduction of symptoms by improving hemodynamics in a reduction of thromboembolic events.	0.9452691087420593
However, several antiarrhythmic drugs are also known to increase the risk of proarrhythmic events.	1.274557261882109

Advantages and disadvantages of these methods are described by in vitro and in vitro testing.	1.1006551944595147
The proof of histotypical function after implantation in vivo is essential.	0.8465965659332971
The use of autologous cells and tissue engineering methods offers the possibility to overcome the disadvantages of classical tissue reconstruction - donor site morbidity of autologous grafts, immunogenicity of allogenic grafts and loosening of alloplastic implants.	1.0246995690473575
Furthermore, tissue engineering widens the spectrum of surgical indications in bone and cartilage reconstruction.	1.2483082015211935
The purpose of this paper is to present principle and technique of proximal lateral column lengthening by calcaneal osteotomy and to critically analyze our preliminary results.	0.9485946227653728
16 patients (7 female, 9 male; average age 52.3 years [24-72 years]) were treated for stage II to III posterior tibial tendon insufficiency by calcaneal osteotomy and medial soft tissue reconstruction (tendon reconstruction, 15; tendon transfer, 8; deltoid ligament repair, 10).	1.168308775083826
When the AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot Rating Scale was applied, these patients were shown to have significantly increased their scores from an average preoperative value of 49.1 to a mean postoperative value of 91.1 after a mean follow-up of 24.6 months.	1.2036392706223813
In all but one case no loss of achieved foot correction was noted.	0.7663669700673437
In one case, a fusion of the calcaneocuboid joint had to be performed after 5 months due to painful degenerative joint disease.	1.067142547406541
At follow-up, all patients had satisfactory restoration of their medial longitudinal arch, reduction of forefoot abduction, and restored arch height.	1.1078383315983982
All patients were able to fully weight-bear the operated foot, and all patients were satisfied with the achieved result.	0.9741300176016922
In the pes planovalgus deformity occurring in stage II to III (as significant degenerative joint disease has not already occurred), osteotomies appear to have a significant role in the operative management and to function by restoring more normal biomechanics, thus allowing tendon reconstruction and tendon transfers to return to successfull function.	1.140576224763186
By the update of §24 a of the German road traffic act driving under the influence of drugs of abuse can now be fined even in absence of an actual driving impairment.	0.9589705765975567
The only requisite is the detection of certain drugs/metabolites in a blood sample.	0.9490593470336681
Therefore for pretesting there is a need for fast and reliable immunological screening methods in blood/serum.	0.8782614594327547
The new Mahsan microtiterplate enzyme immunoassay (MTP-EIA) is claimed to be sensitive and independent of the matrix.	0.9414296676469461
For an evaluation we carried out a comparison of the cannabinoid and opiate assays from Mahsan (MTP-EIA) and the routinely used Abbott fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) with a batch of routine serum samples.	1.0725956413467765
For the MTP-EIAs we used the cut-off recommendations of the supplier (cannabinoids 2 ng/mL, opiates 10 ng/mL).	0.8358061726771849
For the Abbott FPIAs the serum samples had to be pretreated (deproteinization with acetone) and appropriate cut-offs were defined by our investigations (cannabinoids 20 ng/mL, opiates 30 ng/mL).	0.9519396620535497
Out of 136 samples screened for cannabinoids 42% were positive with GC-MS and 18% from 123 samples were positive for opiates.	1.0906853434801225
The Abbott cannabinoid FPIA gave false negative results in 23% of GC-MS positive cases and 9% false negatives for opiates while Mahsan MTP-EIA gave no false negatives.	1.0393116452001965
Each of the two cannabinoid assays gave false positive results in 13% of the cases and for the MTP opiate assay 2% of the positives could not be confirmed with GC-MS. As a result of our study the cut-off values for the MTP-EIAs have proved to be suitable for a distinction between potential positives and true negatives.	1.245314874972068
Systemic karyomegaly associated with interstitial nephritis was first described in 1978 by Mihatsch.	0.778279067640133
Seven cases have been reported to date.	0.9403265152312426
We give an account of an autopsy case of systemic karyomegaly in a 30-year-old Italian man.	1.0082878988553048
Bizarre enlargement of nuclei was found in renal tubular epithelial cells, Schwann cells and in smooth muscle cells of vessels and bowel and, less obviously, in endothelial and adventitial cells of vessels, in alveolar epithelial cells and in astrocytes of the brain.	1.1323348844837537
These findings were associated with chronic interstitial nephritis, nonspecific hepatopathy, adenocarcinoma of the rectum and multiple slerosis.	1.1007136045027528
The clinical course was marked by chronic renal failure, chronic haemodialysis and renal transplantation.	1.0983341814896417
The patient died 8 years after diagnosis in septic-toxic shock.	1.1540230727947958
The aetiology and pathogenesis of the disease are discussed.	1.0028474892724617
17% of malignant melanomas (n=100) investigated in a dermatologic practice were less than 6 mm in maximal diameter (median diameter: 4.0 +/- 0.9 mm).	1.2273500692218728
The median age of the 17 patients at diagnosis of small-diameter melanomas was 42 years.	1.1200723759504472
The essential epiluminescence microscopic and histopatologic features of these small melanomas resembled those of larger lesions, although their clinical criteria differed from the classic ABCDs.	1.0229337464326895
6 (35,3%) of the small melanomas were were found to be in situ.	1.5248361195305604
This percentage was nearly similar to those in situ lesions within the group of melanomas of 6 mm in diameter or larger (38,3%).	0.9803013938351759
The remaining 11 small lesions were classified as invasive from Clark's level I to V, including all classic histogenetic types (superficial spreading, nodular, unclassified, desmoplastic).	0.9208416620226121
The median thickness of the small invasive melanomas was 0,76 +/- 0,23 mm.	1.1020759999660552
7 small melanomas had apparent histologic remnants of a melanocytic nevus.	0.7174710420729461
Epiluminescence microscopic features of the melanomas were evaluated and statistically compared with those of 100 dysplastic nevi and 50 spindle cell nevi.	0.8883596694027867
The technique of epiluminescence microscopy allowed the identification of such malignant melanomas that could not be discerned by the naked eye or by a pocket-lens.	0.8551549806386475
Mycobacterium gordonae is an atypical mycobacterium of very low pathogenic potential.	0.7897303074138112
It is widely distributed in soil and water and often detected on the mucous membranes of healthy persons.	0.8365010018224837
In recent years, there have been numerous reports of infections by M. gordonae in immunocompromised patients.	0.9653463387258758
In contrast, only four cases of skin infections by M. gordonae in immunocompetent patients have been published.	1.0956946610803489
We report on another patient without evidence of immunodeficiency who developed an atypical mycobacteriosis after a thorn injury during gardening.	1.0652804815187882
M. gordonae was isolated by tissue culture.	0.8418811606564779
The skin lesion cleared completely after treatment with doxycycline for three months.	0.7873339176228602
The article gives a review on oncocytic metaplasia and oncocytic tumors.	0.7241665195065146
Biochemical, cytochemical and molecular genetic findings are discussed.	0.8484095602310137
It has been established, that defects of the respiratory chain occur predominantly in oncocytic foci of the parathyroids and the liver.	1.186915428292263
The underlying molecular genetic mechanisms are still unclear, however.	1.0234407840154394
In particular, one has to assume that oncocytic metaplasia differs pathogenetically from oncocytic neoplasia.	0.9488806641431211
Furthermore, organ-dependent prognostic differences of oncocytic tumors exist.	1.2137337324769197
Oncocytic carcinomas are predominantly seen in the thyroid and are scarce in other organs.	1.01555917898079
The molecular genetic basis of this phenomenon is, however, still unknown.	1.2660016205079452
The authors describe the feasibility of developing receptor-specific MR contrast agents for the improved detection of pathology and assessment of organ function.	0.8281380538734494
Receptor specificity of MR contrast agents can be achieved by binding of receptor-specific carriers to ligands.	0.9575667574005474
This concept leads towards a decrease in dose and thus in toxicity.	0.8509610715964411
Specific attachment to parenchymal cells improves tumor-organ contrast and therefore tumor detection.	0.8028559534577036
Specific uptake mechanisms also enable the assessment of organ function.	0.6494504230676451
Future design concepts of novel MR contrast agents may consider the desired uptake in specific cells or organs (ovaries, adrenal glands, lymph nodes etc.)	0.8615312091699483
with subsequent synthesis of appropriate carriers.	0.6364458163321475
Elastosis perforans serpiginosa can arise as a rare complication in patients with Down syndrome.	0.9263703027615164
It is one of the primary perforating disorders characterized by transepithelial elimination of abnormal elastic fibers.	0.9023643997976315
This may reflect an immunological reaction aquist elastic fibers.	0.5936948050991167
We describe a 40-year-old woman with Down's syndrome whose skin lesions were histologically mistaken for lupus vulgaris for a long time.	0.9616700871702739
The position of the talus and the os calcaneum has consequences for the architecture of the forefoot.	0.9925675444677774
Medial tilting of the talus with vertical position provokes flattening of the medial arch and abduction of the forefoot.	0.9973483173055125
Varus position of the calcis and lateral direction of the talus (as in residual clubfoot), however, causes supination and adduction of the forefoot.	1.2595156213647722
Repair of deformities in the hindfoot therefore also influences the forefoot.	0.7542988841703462
A large number of various osteotomies have been proposed at both bones.	0.8285077142126356
The most popular ones are Dwyer's osteotomy at the corpus of the calcis and its modification described by Mitchell at the same location for correction of the cavus foot and the residual clubfoot, and the lengthening osteotomy at the neck of the calcaneum according to Evans.	1.0302415577832467
Indication and operative technique of these three procedures are described in detail.	1.0443782509693806
The closing wedge osteotomy according to Dwyer is indicated in cases of cavus feet.	0.7160842843938403
In clubfeet the os calcis is usually too short and the medial opening wedge osteotomy provokes skin problems.	0.8572419162676101
In these cases an osteotomy according to Mitchell with lateral displacement of the tuber calcanei is more suitable.	0.8698431850325388
In flat- and skewfeet a lengthening osteotomy at the neck of the calcaneum according to Evans can be indicated, especially when the load of the foot is bigger medially under the talus rather than at the lateral margin of the foot.	1.0155319755099586
If these procedures are carried out carefully, they have low complications rates.	1.018949076096687
Between January 1994 and August 1998, 12 patients with 13 chronic infections after resection arthroplasty were treated successfully with vastus lateralis muscleflap.	0.9031360046346548
One patient was suffering from chronic infection on both sides.	0.8826101397454952
In all cases we found the infected cavity to be the origin of the persistent infection.	1.2926653496079783
The average duration of infection was 8.3 months.	1.121357491240593
The patients had undergone an average of 3.8 operations.	1.2719835322649762
Up to now there was no recurrent infection, controlled by clinical investigation, ultrasound and laboratory findings in all 13 cases.	1.2199594320030034
Follow up investigation occured 2.5 years (1.5-4.7) after flap transfer.	1.2237093099215357
The flap is easy to harvest.	0.5776392978010766
He has a very constant pattern of vascular pedicle and a wide arc of rotation.	0.9019731732604583
The functional deficits of donor side morbidity are minimal.	0.7708962211269762
That vastus lateralis flap seems to be an ideal procedure to stop draining infections due to infected cavities in the hip region.	0.9063793325812782
Information technologies have been integrated in gynecological oncology treatment and, therefore, new software has been established in hospitals and private clinics.	1.099147745349178
A German law for hospital tumor registration has attempted to unify the different strategies.	0.7942098464053651
All intentions to establish new documentation systems for tumor diseases need a standardized basic data set.	0.831722819361529
Nevertheless, local governmental health organizations are not yet prepared to implement a global information system such as prenatal and perinatal care databases.	1.1046496479049355
Financial support and political work is therefore needed.	0.7588161941206518
To optimise the microsurgical training in our clinic we organized a permanent possibility to practice microsurgical techniques of vascular anastomosis.	0.9458638610955499
This includes stepwise education by means of plastic materials, human placenta and the rat model.	0.8493182606092095
The most important role in this concept is played by the placenta.	1.2388660421305817
It supplies a realistic simulation of different in vivo situations concerning microvascular anastomosis.	0.7709615294145377
As to availability, handling and costs the placenta is superior to animal models and has replaced them almost completely in our educational concept.	0.8853404038611493
Since Manfred Bleuler's description of the clinical picture of late onset schizophrenia over 50 years ago, debate has persisted as to whether it is justifiable to differentiate this as a valid, independent entity from the group of classic schizophrenic disorders with early onset.	1.0645520835743096
As this review shows, this question cannot be answered unequivocally even now.	0.9936588597942595
It must rather be remarked that we have neither been able to decisively extend our knowledge since Manfred Bleuler's comprehensive contribution, nor managed to achieve a much sounder basis methodologically.	0.9189129173572524
The reasons for this are the international conceptual and terminological confusion that has developed around this illness group, and on the other hand the methodological limitations of the empirical studies conducted on this clinical picture so far.	1.0926382131271812
Definition of the problem: In parallel with public and philosophical discussions, there is an ongoing debate about euthanasia in theological ethics.	1.0014691839442567
In this situation it is helpful to provide a systematic overview of the different arguments and judgements.	1.1555959502223567
Arguments: A short introduction is followed by a first part dealing with the definition of terms.	1.216826715539489
The second and major part concerning normative arguments is subdivided into three steps: the level of principles, the more concrete level of actions and finally the level of social consequences.	1.1176326663177145
The third part presents some reflections following the eudaimonistic ethical tradition (the ethics of a good life and death) focusing on the central question: how to find meaning in life when faced with suffering.	1.0218460906817632
Conclusion: It would be fruitful to intensify the ethical reflection both on the problems concerning the foundations of social life, especially the meaning of dignity, autonomy and inviolability of human life, and social consequences of a liberal practice of euthanasia.	1.1168002583309458
In this context ethicists are challenged to reflect on the different approaches to what is or can be a good life and a human death.	1.0415616942952577
Multimodal therapy of oral squamous cell carcinomas today is based on surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.	1.0362474027077058
Despite the combination of all three therapeutic options, there is still a large number of treatment failures and therefore major questions remain.	1.063573811935642
Recent investigations suggest that mutations of the p53 tumor supressor gene may account for some of the therapeutic failures.	0.930790432532176
Inactivation of the gene may be an  important determinant of the efficiacy of today's multimodal therapy protocols.	0.927802555271095
In 90 patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity biopsy specimens were taken before and after preoperative radiochemotherapy.	0.9185884656419329
From all patients, biopsy and resection material was available for immunohistochemical analysis of p53.	0.8719991940639352
After radiation treatment, 51 patients (57%) showed a complete response; 39 patients (43%) only showed a partial response or did not respond at all.	1.3214413369971085
Among the responders, 82% of the pretherapeutic tumors were p53 positive, whereas among the nonresponders only 56% of the pretherapeutic tumors were p53 positive.	1.0555737807791261
The majority of the residual tumors were also p53 negative according to immunohistology after radiation treatment.	1.0248766875373039
In our study, detection of p53 protein by immunohistochemistry seemed to be connected with a more radiosensitive reaction of the tumors.	0.9894527342532545
Nevertheless, successful strategies for radiation therapy may need to take into account the tissue of origin and the status of p53 in the tumor.	1.2541070095104532
The human cartilage and bone is characterized by a remodeling during the life, well balanced by neosynthesis and degradation of matrix components.	0.9770211967785295
In different joint diseases, it becomes imbalanced and the destruction of the cartilage supersedes the repair.	1.0101852254373096
In tissue processes in disease and in normal turnover of the matrix, these molecules are fragmented and released into surrounding fluids, in the synovial fluid, and then in the blood and the urin, where they can be detected.	1.2749989776751887
The quantitative measurement in the synovial fluid is more specific than in the other body fluids.	1.06964888774721
The research process in recent years has suggested that these molecular markers of cartilage and bone matrix metabolism can be used to determine diagnosis, the disease severity rather than its presence or absence, the prognosis, and the response to therapy.	1.343780286029484
They should help to identify the disease mechanism in different joint diseases not only on the tissue but also on the molecular level.	1.0625191098698406
The specific cartilage matrix markers promise to become useful tools in the future in clinical use.	1.0010928834620696
The research in this area is still in the early stages, with most results dated from the end of the 1980s and the 1990s.	1.2407906512327036
Axillary block is a common anaesthetic technique for operations on the hand and forearm.	1.0390440636904998
In our hospital, with many trainees in anaesthesia, only 250 - 300 axillary blocks per year are performed by about 30 colleagues.	1.2197585284477288
This implies a small number of blocks for each anaesthetist.	0.8338875122867123
The present study was designed to assess whether it is possible to teach this technique and use it with an adequate degree of success under these conditions.	1.1712303447744434
We used a nerve stimulator and studied whether the success of the block under these conditions is independent of anaesthetist's experience in this technique.	0.9612326130688617
Furthermore, we examined other factors involved in the success of the block.	1.2719906184752137
The study included 112 patients subjected to elective surgery of the upper extremity; all received an axillary block.	1.0197744190975995
We used a nerve stimulator and injected mepivacaine 1% without adrenaline.	0.9122809630256852
The following parameters were recorded: the number of blocks to date performed by the anaesthetist; the minimal current required for nerve stimulation; the dose of local anaesthetic; the time between the end of injection and the beginning of surgery; the duration of surgery; and the quality of sensory and motor blockade after 10, 20, and 30 min.	1.2854178814551545
Sensory blockade was assessed by the pinprick method (no blockade, analgesia, anaesthesia); motor blockade was judged by comparing the muscle strength of both arms (no blockade, paresis, paralysis).	0.9953207285035732
Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test, with P<0.05 considered statistically significant.	1.095401827430496
Of the 112 blocks, 95 (85%) were successful; 17 (15%) failed and the patients required general anaesthesia.	1.217540662486708
Eight of the successful blocks showed a decrease in analgesic quality after >=70 min and required additional analgesics or general anaesthesia.	0.9316267647136595
We found no correlation between the experience of the anaesthetist and the success of the block.	0.9039947255139802
The minimal required current for nerve stimulation in the success group was 0.4 mA and differed significantly from the value of 0.6 mA in the failure group (Table 3).	1.0672407541664999
The dose of mepivacaine was higher in the success group (5.9 vs. 5.3 mg/kg).	1.196672108016593
Complete sensory blockade was more frequently achieved for the median, ulnar, and radial nerves than for the musculocutaneous and cutaneous brachii medialis (Fig.	0.9651318899102704
The frequency of complete sensory blockade (anaesthesia) had increased by 21.9% between the 20th and 30th min.	1.1023922478254984
Complete motor blockade was less often achieved than sensory blockade (Fig.	0.724709334847125
Using the method of electrostimulation, the axillary block is an appropriate anaesthetic technique that can be applied in a hospital where each anaesthetist only occasionally performs it.	1.237550015699288
Prior to injection of the local anaesthetic, the current for nerve stimulation should be reduced to <0.5 mA.	1.3350549855134952
The time between the end of injection and the beginning of surgery should be no less than 30 min because complete sensory blockade can more often be achieved.	0.8887735353186769
The dose of mepivacaine should be no less than 6 mg/kg body weight.	0.948024149204153
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was discovered 10 years ago as a growth factor that can regulate angiogenesis and in addition the permeability of blood vessels.	1.0681020396748704
Numerous studies have revealed that it is essential for normal embryonic development and that it plays a major role in physiological and pathological events of angiogenesis in adults.	1.0889175772972828
