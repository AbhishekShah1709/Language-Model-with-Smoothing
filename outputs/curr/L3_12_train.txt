The recently published conjecture that such lesions of the retroperitoneum represent a separate entity with features of a malignant neoplasm is discussed.	1.092110972856007
An example of a plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumour (PFT) is presented for the first time in the German-language literature.	1.203951157895825
The diagnostic criteria for this rare soft-tissue neoplasm of childhood and young adulthood, which is mostly subcutaneous in location and has a tendency to recur, include the plexiform structure which gives it its name, extensive siderin deposits and numerous osteoclast-like giant cells.	1.1304128244633036
The development of the tumour described here, which occurred in the field of radiation of a malignant haemangiopericytoma excised 7 years previously, indicates the possibility of induction of PFT by radiation.	1.2167051736996415
The current increase in the cost of health care must be considered as a severe threat to the prehospital emergency services system.	1.1106645735389002
Two examples have been selected - the patient with polytrauma and the patient in cardiac arrest - to demonstrate the dilemma between a need for objective data and the requirements of emergency patients.	1.5558524974787018
Study results obtained in trauma patients indicating that total prehospital time, including scene time, is correlated to patient outcome have led to the conclusion that at the scene treatment by emergency physicians may be dispensable.	1.146264769468671
It has, however also been demonstrated that the time required for medical treatment at the scene is equivalent to 20% of the total scene time, thus representing only a fraction of the total prehospital time.	1.2851680559472614
Correlating the total prehospital time or scene time to outcome therefore appears absurd.	0.7473492681569166
The treatment principle of aggressive shock treatment in polytrauma needs critical reevaluation on the basis of results obtained by recent preclinical studies in patients with penetrating torso injuries.	1.0252379288322018
Small volume resuscitation could not be demonstrated to improve outcome in polytrauma patients, although a slight improvement in patients with brain injury may be assumed.	1.1633048127423344
Endotracheal intubation and early artificial ventilation are proven therapeutic principles in polytraumatized patients.	0.8469508144842782
Unfortunately, for ethical reasons randomised carefully controlled comparative studies can not be performed in polytrauma patients unless the patient is fully conscious.	1.2325817442464406
The importance of endotracheal intubation and artificial ventilation in unconscious trauma patients becomes apparent under conditions of anaesthesia where the application of the endotracheal tube averts regurgitation, aspiration and concomitant morbidity and mortality.	0.9442968632112101
The common causes of cardiovascular collapse and their pathomechanisms, as well as the mechanisms of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, have been widely investigated.	1.1237672819676647
Nevertheless, various aspects of their application are still controversial.	1.2898062398108519
The most recent study results have recommended initial ventilation prior to thoracic compression.	0.9021880777630875
New methods of assisting mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation, such as ACD CPR or vest CPR, have shown promising results in animal experiments.	0.9813704465399293
However, the importance of results obtained by preclinical randomised controlled investigations in humans need to be confirmed by further studies as to outcome.	1.0228075667000804
The efficacy of defibrillation in cases of ventricular fibrillation has been clearly demonstrated, particularly with a view to the interval between ventricular fibrillation and defibrillation.	1.1360205958602003
It has further been demonstrated that basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation preserves ventricular fibrillation and thus improves the chance of survival.	0.8268959871431525
The present generation of defibrillators has been further improved, particularly by the introduction of biphasic defibrillator wave forms, which may reduce the required energy, as well as possible complications, while offering an increase in the efficacy of defibrillation and a reduction in defibrillator size.	1.1293542111535617
Scientific emergency medicine is responsible not only for the development and validation of new methods and concepts, but in particular for their application under quality control conditions.	1.2314497143477376
Politicians require an improvement in the quality of the validation of emergency measures, although the instruments available for the investigation of these measures are known to be obsolete (experimental models, experimental design).	1.104158043962177
Additionally, the financial support of research in emergency medicine suffers from being accourded low priority by public research funds such as the German Research Fund.	0.9559077181404572
However, in view of the rapid application of experimental results to daily practice it should be emphasized that patients also support research in emergency medicine via their direct financial contributions to the health insurance companies.	1.067645255649984
The prognosis in patients with gynecologic cancers depends not only on the stage but also on a wide spectrum of other findings.	0.9800281844596042
Cross-sectional imaging modalities, including sonography, CT and MRI, have increasingly been used for optimal treatment planning in gynecologic cancers.	1.1758428135707153
Their staging criteria are based on the well-established FIGO staging system.	1.023702658705299
CT and MRI compete with sonography, which plays a pivotal role in the evaluation of the female pelvis.	1.0137938407600733
This paper reviews the role of sonography, CT and MRI in the staging of gynecologic malignancies.	0.9441895501096056
It puts the emphasis on MRI, which has been established as imaging modality of choice in the preoperative evaluation of cervical and endometrial cancer, and which seems slightly superior to CT in the staging of ovarian cancer.	1.183266306758562
Extraabdominal desmoids represent one group of deep fibromatoses.	0.7506818159019325
These aggressive nonmetastasizing tumorlike lesions have a strong tendency to local infiltration, with a recurrence rate of about 40 %.	1.100772330583891
Trauma, hormones and heredity have been implicated as etiologic factors.	0.7500912979499582
Shoulder, chest wall, back and thigh are favored sites.	0.7828503501174009
By combination of different diagnostic procedures the number of differential diagnoses can be reduced to only a few.	1.0864891599597997
While in former times surgery was thought to be the only kind of therapy, nowadays adjuvant procedures like radiation, hormonal therapy and also chemotherapy are becoming more and more important.	1.0866170741649412
Amputation or other mutilating procedures should be done only if the tumor recurs repeatedly.	0.9521830992559773
Katayama syndrome is an allergic reaction of antigens of schistosomes, known as the acute phase of schistosomiasis.	1.0668048393933336
We report on an eleven year-old boy, who was seen at our outpatient department because of cough and oedema of the face after travelling to Malawi.	1.2275663997914938
Remarkable findings were an eosinophilia and antibodies against schistosoma-antigens.	0.7015053780672461
Six weeks later the diagnosis was confirmed by detecting eggs of Schistosoma haematobium in the urine.	0.8313077271170891
Parasitological examinations of urine and faeces four months later were negative.	0.8056337451519422
There is still a significant lack of treatment and rehabilitation facilities for chronic pain patients in Germany today.	1.2595571890574813
Most of all the treatment of low back pain and widespread pain syndromes or panalgesia is time consuming and complicated.	1.147013188480923
The main problem of anaesthesiological pain clinics is the increase of these complex pain syndromes in the last years.	1.08084696255658
The definition of chronic pain is a contiuous noxious input modulated and compounded by the prolonged or recurrent nature of chronic state and further complicated by a multitude of economic and psychosocial factors.	0.9898509338686385
It is now clear that no one discipline or mode will suffice.	0.854242643327698
Only a multidisciplinary and intensive approache will prevail, as discussed in this article.	1.1215199415906776
Unfortunately these multidisciplinary pain units are nearly not existing in Gemany just as little as control of the effectiveness of pain treatment.	0.8762460290353372
The use of somato-sensory evoked potentials (SEP) in supraaortal reconstructions has been well accepted.	0.9695125843512076
However, reports about incidence and clinical significance of ischaemic SEP alterations differ widely.	1.1569758516589328
In a prospective study we registered SEP alterations during 482 operations done on 419 patients between 1 July 1994, and 31 December 1996.	1.088871940794572
Incidence, risk factors and clinical relevance were investigated.	0.9272997176575035
In only 1.7% of cases SEP examination was inadequate.	1.2058809805166757
During 406 operations SEP were altered minimally or not at all.	0.5702276538523786
Significant changes were dedected during 65 interventions (13.5%).	0.7594152586688256
The clinical outcome was poor when alteration was found during carotid dissection (five events, three deficits).	1.107603676043319
Cross-clamping ischaemia was the common reason for alterations (81.5%); they were generally reversible after shunting and without clinical significance.	1.0996500346696256
As risk factor for cross-clamping ischaemia, only contralateral carotid occlusion was identified.	1.0064316012086545
Tyrosine-rich crystalloids in tumors of the salivary glands are rare and have been reported mainly in specimens from Black African patients.	1.0664512607975516
The pathogenesis of these structures is still unclear, but pathological secretion by neoplastic myoepithelial cells is supposed.	1.1036683747267393
Millon's staining and ultrastructural examinations are used for confirming the diagnosis.	0.8154749178840383
We present the case report of a 59-year-old woman with a myoepithelioma of the minor salivary glands in the smooth palate containing tyrosine-rich crystalloids as an example of this rare phenomenon.	1.0208685472653396
Pseudoarthrosis and cubitus valgus as main complications following displaced fractures of the radial condyle in children can be prevented by open reduction and fixation by K wires.	0.9610425113791673
However, delayed union and stimulation of the radial physis with condylar overgrowth and varisation of the elbow as well as fishtail deformities of the distal end of the humerus are reported nevertheless.	1.23355664371986
To prevent those growth disturbances all primary and secondary (4-day X-ray control) displaced fractures of the radial condyle, i. e. those with a central gap of more than 2 mm, were prospectively treated by open reduction and osteosynthesis with a metaphyseal lag screw beginning 1974.	1.1088782897650873
Sixty-six patients (41 boys, 25 girls) with an average follow-up of 10 years (2-22 years) sustained 28 primary and 6 secondary displaced fractures.	1.3675598980308858
In 5 cases a K wire fixation was performed in view of the smallness of the fragment.	1.071514812354979
Two children with conservative treatment following overlooked displaced fractures showed condylar overgrowth and varisation of the elbow.	0.7956485771780716
Screw osteosynthesis led to symmetric elbow angles and function in all cases, whereas fishtail deformities could be observed in 8 of 27 children, probably as a consequence of the remaining central fracture instability.	1.1606651091649245
Conclusion: Open reduction and osteosynthesis with a metaphyseal lag screw prevents condylar overgrowth in displaced fractures of the radial condyle by guaranteeing fracture healing in anatomic position within 3-4 weeks.	1.05173224795425
However, fishtail deformity can not be prevented by metaphyseal compression only.	1.1589217486127048
A commercially available C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) concentrate was used for short-term prophylaxis before surgery in two patients with hereditary angioneurotic oedema.	1.0156874039802946
The patients suffered from recurrent subcutaneous and submucosal oedema of the face, extremities, and gastrointestinal tract as the result of a hereditary C1-INH deficiency.	0.988144316012008
Both patients were receiving tranexamic acid or danazol therapy as oral long-term prophylaxis.	0.8825178241389998
Over the years the patients underwent several operations in regional and general anaesthesia, with mask ventilation or intubation.	1.0863092383278845
The C1-INH plasma concentrations measured preoperatively were always very low (0.02-0.06 g/l, normal range 0.15-0.35 g/l), despite the oral long-term prophylaxis.	1.2414796079724137
Substitution treatment with 500-1000 U C1-INH was performed 1 h before surgery.	0.8681972713931146
No side effects were seen following the concentrate infusions.	0.8261350028201309
With this substitution treatment no specific symptoms of hereditary angioneurotic oedema were recognized in either case.	0.826890708935346
The measurement of C1-INH plasma concentration 2 h or 4 h after C1-INH substitution showed a marked rise in both patients, though normal values were not reached in either.	1.006249008649344
We suggest that infusion of C1 concentrate is an appropriate form of preoperative substitution treatment in patients with hereditary angioneurotic oedema, in view of the lower risk of infection than with infusion of fresh-frozen plasma and the observed effectiveness.	1.1364502716916174
This case report describes a 62 years old patient who suffered from therapy resisten atrial fibrillation for 12 years.	1.0766637015282245
She underwent "Cox/Maze-III-Procedure" during a mitral valve reconstruction and a stable sinus rhythm was achieved.	1.0054679395898056
Two years after operation she has been in a stable sinus rhythm.	0.9559133528170966
Transesophageal echocardiography revealed normal cardiac dimensions and function with coordinated atrioventricular contractility.	0.7279198687721256
Therefore the therapy with anticoagulants and antiarrhythmics could be discontinued.	0.8106602894023355
Two cases of congenital wandering spleen with typical clinical course are reported:  An 11-year old girl had a two month history of intermittent abdominal pain predominantly after physical stress.	1.1566131945275633
In upright position a palpable resistance could be identified as wandering spleen by ultrasound and scintiscan, and in this case splenopexy was performed.	1.1938064728876658
An otherwise healthy 3-year old girl suffered from acute abdomen caused by torsion of an upside- down spleen with partial infarction.	1.0924947895132187
Diagnosis was made based on ultrasound and CT-Scan.	0.9249505677038985
The extent of infarction could be evaluated by color flow sonography.	0.9553630695444874
After partial resection splenopexy in orthotopic position was performed.	0.6788825897133787
Discussion: In situations of intermittent abdominal pain as well as acute abdomen torsion of wandering spleen should be taken into consideration.	0.9426082947134088
Monodisciplinary orthopaedic pain therapy no longer measures up to international standards.	0.797473540767351
In cases of chronic back pain, in particular, there is such a gulf between the clinical findings and the patient's subjective assessment that the symptoms cannot be attributed solely to so-called degenerative changes.	1.2398591170483964
Back pain patients are in great danger of becoming fixated on somatic symptoms due to an excess of diagnostic procedures or incorrect diagnoses, of being treated purely somatically on the basis of associated findings, and of suffering irreversible damage from invasive management of such findings.	1.1435759559841308
Despite the wealth of empirical evidence, it remains difficult to expand the everyday concept of illness and its causes to include not only physical and biological factors but also social and emotional disturbances.	1.068930791722408
Particularly physicians with a purely biological concept of pain have not learned to take note of affective relational factors and incorporate them into their diagnostic assessment.	0.88973045683317
The decision to undertake invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedures then frequently represents the doctor's reaction to feelings of irritation or helplessness.	0.9318609824046785
If this situation is to change, an interdisciplinary concept of pain must be made a part of medical training, and scientific findings must be presented in such a way that they can be integrated into routine daily practice.	1.1175860403616005
The laboratory surveillance of measles in Germany contributes to an objective estimation of the situation.	0.8503707901172641
Compared to data of the pre-vaccination era, the incidence of measles has been reduced, while a shift in age towards the group of 15-year-olds is observed.	1.201535556495381
Germany will have considerable difficulties to reach the aim of eradicating measles in the European region by the year 2007.	1.1361838275916298
Apart from the fact that systematic surveillance is lacking, the immunity gaps in small children represent a particularly weak spot.	0.9434308758427788
In order to effectively control measles, high vaccination rates of at least 90% are necessary by the end of the second year of life.	1.178988557089582
In addition, laboratory surveillance has to be included to measure successful vaccination.	1.2927892189592576
Main focusses are the laboratory confirmation of suspected measles cases, seroprevalence studies of population immunity as well as the control of the circulation of measles viruses.	1.14302472918136
The Working Group Measles ("Arbeitsgemeinschaft Masern" - AGM) as well as the amended law on infection prevention are important instruments to make measurable progress towards measles eradication also in Germany.	1.1853204975779308
We report on the activities of the National Reference Centre for Measles, Mumps and Rubella since 1991.	1.0171012093000698
The German data are compared to those of selected other European countries.	0.8858241502533618
The different methods that are available for the assessment and quantification of "brittle nails" and for the evaluation of various therapeutical approaches are compared.	1.2773122660934855
At this time, measurement of the swelling properties is the best documented and most reliable method for studying the treatment of brittle nails.	1.064241139930809
Reliable qualitative data can also be obtained by scanning electron microscopy.	0.8700717292058341
Measurement of the transonychial water loss and assessment of thickness and density of nails by ultrasound have also been used successfully, but the methodology still has to be improved and the reproducibility, confirmed.	1.1626604922893555
The case of a closed elbow dislocation with complete rupture of the brachial artery and its veins is described.	1.1423904489285304
This combination of injuries is rather rare and only 25 cases were found in the literature.	0.9980793710825475
The sharp lesion of the vessels was remarkable, probably due to the edge of the distally ruptured capsule.	0.8831924034557334
Immediate revision with suture of the vessels and an immobilization for three weeks gave a good result.	0.9948142362536222
The management of multiple trauma patients has improved recently.	0.7586276082779455
Surgeons' education, preclinical rescue structures, initial clinical survey and therapeutic strategies, as well as diagnostic imaging, have progressed.	1.0015940028991746
Plain film imaging is increasingly being abandoned in favor of CT. Fast imaging techniques (spiral CT) have led to the inclusion of CT in the primary survey.	1.0676227842951729
To minimize the risk to the patient during prolonged diagnostic time, algorithms have to be defined concerning structures, emergency room equipment and quality.	1.137568848600092
Basics, state of the art and suggestions concerning management of multiple trauma patients are presented and discussed from the radiologist's point of view.	0.9640620456309884
The importance of hepatitis C virus infection has been recently noted in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or dilated cardiomyopathy.	0.8732126690070687
In a collaborative research project of the Committees for the Study of Idiopathic Cardiomyopathy, hepatitis C virus antibody was found in 74 of 697 patients (10.65) with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and in 42 of 663 patients (6.3%) with dilated cardiomyopathy; these prevalences were significantly higher than that found in volunteer blood donors in Japan.	1.1964330860185735
Hepatitis C virus antibody was detected in 650 of 11,967 patients (5.4%) seeking care in 5 academic hospitals.	1.1185267703574666
Various cardiac abnormalities were found, and arrhythmias were the most frequent.	1.0763208359565515
These observations suggest that hepatitis C virus infection is an important cause of a variety of otherwise unexplained heart diseases.	0.9821131572795345
Transdifferentiated retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) display enhanced contractile potentials and have been implicated in the development of tractional retinal detachment.	0.9510576901492453
This study determines the activity of contraction-promoting factors, examines some involved mechanisms and evaluates inhibitors.	0.78592991428673
Using an in vitro contractionassay, we demonstrated that collagen matrix contraction by transdifferentiated RPE cells is effectively stimulated by serum, platelet-derived growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-1.	1.0247818027149709
Endothelin-1 and transforming growth factor-1 and -2 have a more discrete or marginal effect.	1.3559962701611412
Tractional forces promoted by these peptides are completely protein synthesis dependent.	0.7286559401263203
Contraction stimulated by serum is only partly dependent on de novo protein synthesis, suggesting different active factors and/or pathways.	0.8934718854887144
Staurosporine, a broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor, effectively inhibited collagen matrix contraction by transdifferentiated RPE cells regardless of the promoter.	0.8361108495930278
Revascularization in cases of recurrent occlusions following aorto-iliac vascular reconstructions, particular in high-risk patients, poses a therapeutic dilemma.	0.8889499496848444
We report the case of a 78-year-old female patient who presented - after multiple vascular reconstructions of iliac and femoral arteries - with Leriche syndrome, resulting critical limb ischemia and concomitant coronary and lung disease.	1.11763553386193
Due to the high surgical and anesthetic risk we implanted an axillo-bifemoral PTFE graft.	0.9259767694252931
The preoperative angiography of the supraaortic branches revealed a high-grade stenosis of the right subclavian artery in the presence of a previously implanted carotid-subclavian bypass on the left.	1.1650230353990643
This stenosis was dilated and then stented by way of the proximal end of the axillo-bifemoral graft, which in turn was distally anastomosed to the right popliteal and left deep femoral artery.	1.0547280385487665
Postoperative angiography verified a good run-off and satisfactory vascular status was obtained.	0.8146559301043361
Duplex sonography 6 months after surgery showed a good flow and the patient was free of symptoms.	1.1910153308741072
These results demonstrate that, combined with intraoperative stent application, an axillo-bifemoral graft can be implanted with good results.	0.9844822745663968
Objective: Concerning the long-term somatic development of children born with very low birth weight and/or born very premature, there are varying and sometimes contradictory statements.	1.1078327894191387
A follow-up study was carried out on premature-born children from Thuringia and Saxonia at pre-school and early school age in order to investigate the long-term somatic development of these children.	1.000983300412477
Anthropological parameters were examined and compared with the data of a reference group.	1.178471606386953
Mediastinitis caused by infection with Clostridium perfringens and spontaneous rupture of the esophagus are both life threatening conditions.	0.9244886720054327
The combination of these two entities led to septic multiorgan failure in a 38-year-old woman.	0.9440544420734935
The patient was treated successfully by esophagectomy and postoperative lavage through a partially open abdomen.	0.9821076110849084
The lack of information regarding emesis, the leading symptom of Boerhaave's syndrome, caused delayed diagnosis: the triad of emesis, severe epigastric pain and emphysema of the skin was not established until 30 h after the onset of symptoms.	1.1155206742616401
For ethical and socio-economical reasons (cost-explosion in transfusion-medicine, patient's individual destiny), devepolment and consistent application of allogeneic transfusion sparing techniques in surgery is a chal- lenge to anesthesiologists, surgeons and blood-bankers.	1.0501865564859152
The combination of different techniques, i.e.	0.6464811845958865
autologous predonation, hemodilution, choice of anesthetic regimen, deliberate hypotension, application of anti-fibrinolytic agents and autotransfusion of intraoperatively saved blood allow for avoidance of allogeneic blood transfusion even in patients presenting important intraoperative hemorrhage.	0.9421797119626091
Introduction: If the surgeon cannot find the tendon of the superior oblique muscle in the right place, he has to change his operative plans intraoperatively.	1.2002127670205742
Different procedures are recommended: reinsertion of the superior oblique in the right place, recession of the inferior oblique muscle, and operations on the vertical muscles of the same or the yoke eye.	1.0746044939476487
No quantitative recommendations on the surgical amount are mentioned in the literature.	0.7356271872707514
In 180 children (87 children belonging to a control group, 68 with fever of non-renal origin, and 25 with pyelonephritis) albumin and immunoglobulin G (markers for glomerular dysfunction), -1-microglobulin and  -NAG (markers for proximal tubular dysfunction) and apolipoprotein A1 (marker of 'postrenal' dysfunction) were measured in second-voided morning urine.	1.0851387065455602
In children with fever of non-renal origin, glomerular dysfunction was encountered in 8.8 %, tubular dysfunction in 17.6 % and mixed glomerular-tubular dysfunction in 14.7 % of cases.	1.1398607752452976
Among children with pyelonephritis, 28 % revealed glomerular dysfunction and 44 % mixed glomerular-tubular dysfunction.	1.159775172816696
No case of solitary proximal tubular dysfunction was observed in children with pyelonephritis.	1.1209891243900578
There were highly significant differences in presence and expression of glomerular dysfunction between children with fever of non-renal origin and children with pyelonephritis (P < 0.0001), whereas with regard to proximal tubular dysfunction, the differences were only moderately significant ( -NAG: P < 0.01) or of low significance (-1-microglobulin: P < 0.05).	1.1427051223411144
This may indicate that morphologic changes occur during interstitial pyelonephritis due to inflammation of glomeruli, resulting in glomerular dysfunction, while proximal tubular dysfunction may additionally be due to fever-associated function processes.	0.9792377932412989
Up to the middle of the 1970s, chemotherapy had only a marginal role in the overall treatment concept for cervical carcinoma, and surgery and radiotherapy are still the cornerstones of treatment today.	1.2338349868709642
There are indications for chemotherapy, which can theoretically be used as follows:	1.3188479355368274
We compared a cw carbon dioxide flash-scanning laser system to an Er:YAG laser in laser skin resurfacing of facial rhytides.	0.8583523869987525
In all patients, CO2 laser treatment showed a better cosmetic result whereas erythema and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation were less marked in Er:YAG laser therapy.	0.846862773810141
A separation of the individual latex layers is a known complication of endotracheal armoured tubes manufactured by immersion technique.	0.9297819211258345
This can result in herniation into the lumen with obstruction of the tube.	0.7206939504896905
Diffusion of nitrous oxide into the inner hernia considerably intensifies the obstruction.	0.676958748718682
This can lead to life-threatening situations.	0.7886169565042966
We observed a similar herniation caused by layer separation with subsequent tube obstruction of silicolatex anaesthesia tubes used in paediatric circuit systems.	0.8682426383122623
This is caused by manufacturing defects and above all by damage incurred in reprocessing.	0.6805512918674171
Therefore it is important to process the tubes carefully.	0.8497859693905163
A too-high drying temperature can cause premature layer separation.	0.7106614092094149
The tubes should never be processed more than 80 times.	0.8028460825881638
Routine examination of the tubes is imperative, especially at the predilection sites for layer separation.	1.0179806074681725
Severe aortic valve disease is a rare complication of coarctation in adults.	1.1915152014880819
Between 1961 and 1990 aortic valve replacement was performed after or combined with the operation of coarctation in 24 adults (4% of entire population operated for coarctation).	1.128382076387457
Bicuspid aortic valves were present in 2/3 of patients.	0.9199757602496231
In 10 patients (710 with aortic stenosis) coarctation was operated early (mean age 24 years) and aortic valve late (mean age 40 years): in 14 (1014 with aortic regurgitation, mean age 40 years) aortic valve and coarctation were operated simultaneously (8 patients) or staged within 6 months (6 patients).	1.2204468862002305
Additional surgical interventions on the dilated aorta ascendens were performed in 8, mitral valve replacement in 2 and aorto-coronary bypass in 1 patients.	0.9507103910005209
Early mortality was 224 (8%) and was similar in simultaneously (18) and staged (114) operated cases: 10 year survival was lower than in an age-matched group of 72 patients with aortic valve disease of similar severity operated during the same period (70% vs 88%, p < 0.01): 67 late deaths were cardia; 55 pts with preoperatively severely increased end-diastolic (> 199 mlm2) and 44 with end-systolic (> 90 mlm2) left ventricular volumes and 22 with ejection fraction < 41 % died late postoperatively.	1.252382581184443
Abstract  13 experienced addiction therapists provid-ed information about trauma experiences and comorbidity of 122 clients (26 women and 96 men) with opiate addiction and multiple substance abuse.	0.9850013739717259
42% had had at least one traumatic life experience and the women had higher percentages than men.	1.0769264394442983
The victimization primarely took place during childhood and prior to the begin of drug consumption.	0.7728696219123589
26% of the trauma victims were diagnosed as having post-traumatic stress disorder.	1.1860048404719303
In comparison with individuals without trauma experiences, victims evidenced significantly more comorbid symptoms, they more frequently suffered from polytoxicomania and had more experiences with psychotherapy.	0.9826543287687938
Nearly all drugs currently used during the course of general anaesthesia may lead to hypersensitivity reactions of various types.	0.9328398650534953
There may be an acute type I allergic reactions or to a more or less severe pseudoallergic reactions, in rare cases with lethal outcome.	1.0439139071823722
Routine preoperative testing appears of little predictive value, in spite of the high frequency of so-called risk factors (atopy, other kind of allergy) among the evaluated group of patients.	1.0743174924798207
Careful allergological testing should be performed 4 to 6 weeks after any incidents of suspected drug intolerance, in order to discover the underlying causative agent.	1.0154827116381093
Skin testing is of diagnostic value for neuromuscular blockers and intravenous narcotics.	0.9156698657615269
RAST- and RIA-tests and/or mediator releasing tests may also used additionally.	0.9497351121357127
Together with all other administered drugs, all the routinely used neuromuscular blockers (suxamethonium, vecuronium, pancuronium, alcuronium, atracurium, mivacurium) should be tested, since they often represent the cause for such reactions.	1.0125271081354932
For other classes of drugs (for example, volatile anesthetics and opioids) the clinical relevance of skin testing still remains uncertain.	1.1164060121927364
For less severe incidents seen during general anaesthesia such as pruritus, or exanthems, skin testing seems to be less relevant.	1.0658996698982532
Nociception is a protective system of the body which prevents it from injury and tissue damage.	1.022418738419006
Human beings respond to noxious stimuli by moving away.	0.5721661200261103
They learn by pain to avoid these situations in future.	0.865491024940248
Shortly after major injury, there is a limited analgesic period allowing the body to flee the area of danger, later on, emerging pain compels the body to rest and supports recuperation.	0.9732760276455537
While acute pain has a certain meaning, chronic pain does not.	1.0257382884269073
It induces a comprehensive suffering including loss of initiative, appetite and vigilance.	0.7422671820916352
It reduces life-quality, often accompanied by depressive moods.	0.966602712228724
Acute pain causes changes in the central nervous system leading to an increased sensitivity of nociception (hyperalgesia).	0.9113624439085328
During healing, the central processing of noxious stimuli is normalised taking minutes to weeks.	0.979788851767978
Sometimes, unknown factors initiate chronification of pain.	0.5978467925545775
Changes on a molecular level in peripheral tissue as well as in the central nervous system induce "cellular early genes" [24], a synthesis of c-fos, c-jun and other proteins favouring the chronification of pain.	1.1256449613560404
All efforts have to be made to depress or interrupt such a development.	0.8556315250742121
One of the first steps to pain prophylaxis in a hospital is an optimal surgical technique: incision, extension, limited tissue damage and minimal invasive surgery should guarantee the smallest impairment of the nociceptive system possible.	1.1329733860259952
However, nociceptive input is intense and of long duration and leads to central sensibilisation.	1.0820881654496592
Postoperative pain has lost its function as surgery anticipates healing.	0.7606333563981117
Pain induces a reduction of ventilation, circulation, digestion and increases the risk of other disorders.	0.9014732780060978
There is need of aggressive pain treatment for humanitarian reasons and for reasons of late sequelae like permanent pain and increased reduction of function [10].	0.9272691962044166
This is of pivotal importance in patients with amputations or sympathetic reflex dystrophy (SRD).	0.8264560975304549
Antinociception is best provided by regional anaesthesia technique with a combination of local anaesthetics and opioids which results in better outcome [2, 12].	1.0278039334415754
Hence, regional anaesthesia techniques are strongly indicated in those patients.	1.068075130105469
Good antinociception may be even more important than it is assumed today.	0.9721309368019035
Anand [1] demonstrated a lower morbidity and mortality in 45 newborns undergoing cardiothoracic surgery, when general anaesthesia was performed with high-dose sufentanil versus halothane supplementary doses of morphine.	1.1275426241947277
Anaesthesiologists have to reconsider the quality of general anaesthesia: the antinociception of their regimen.	1.0329905917597824
In diagnostics of erectile dysfunction there are different simple or large-scale procedures available.	0.8828687383210571
Refering to a three-step-scheme that makes difference in the diagnostics in I. non-invasive, II.	1.1744878549785
invasive procedures the current diagnostic measures will be explained.	0.8007989579427655
To the non-invasive measures do account the extensive patients history taking including the sexual history and the psychological diagnostics, the physical examination and laboratory screenings.	1.0984770421576568
The semi-invasive procedures include the intracavernous injection test with vasoactice substances, the doppler sonography and duplex or color duplex sonography, the corpus-cavernosum-electromyogram (CC-EMG) and other neurophysiological examinations.	1.082783481584226
The third invasive step contains the dynamic infusion pharmacological cavernosography and cavernosometry (DICC) and the selective pharmacological phallo-arteriography.	1.019080867820804
The procedures of this step are essentially limited to patients with erectile dysfunction who are planned for surgical interventions.	0.9289393624918658
Technological advances in the last two years in mammalian nuclear transfer techniques and the establishment of human embryonic stem cell lines formed the background of the International Workshop on "Embryonic Stem Cells and Nuclear Transfer Strategies" organized at the Gene Center, Munich, September 1999.	1.0453093325723375
The aim of the meeting was to bring together scientists working in the stem cell field and those working on somatic nuclear transfer techniques to discuss the present status and prospects of both technologies for basic and applied research and future use in medicine and livestock breeding.	1.1044266702273593
"Biology of Embryonic Stem Cells", "Nuclear Transfer Strategies", and "Stem Cell Differentiation - Cell Therapy" were the main topics of the meeting.	1.3015087938373238
It became clear that we are far from understanding the processes involved in stem cell self-renewal and differentiation and the mechanisms resulting in reprogramming of nuclei from somatic cells after transfer into enucleated oocytes.	0.8983191151701189
However, data were presented that showed the enormous potential of the embryonic stem cell technology for tissue transplantation in the future.	1.2023222355697822
Before any use of this technology in combination with any cloning technology for human cell therapy will be possible, further research including animal models and stem cell differentiation approaches in culture (i. e., identification of differentiation factors, selective differentiation strategies, reporter gene assays) is necessary to understand the basic principles of pluripotent stem cell differentiation and the mechanisms involved in reprogramming somatic cell nuclei.	1.0956097148147756
Certain fractures and/or dislocations of the femoral head are known to cause arterial injury and result in post-traumatic osteonecrosis.	1.0700517913670498
However, the more complex etiology of non-traumatic osteonecrosis is multifactorial and includes chemotherapy, radiotherapy, thermal injuries, and especially coagulopathies, which are now commonly observed in these patients.	1.2203219803923837
Intravascular coagulation with fibrin thrombosis begins in the capillaries and sinusoids of the intraosseous microcirculation, and residual venous thrombosis is more likely to occur if there is coexistent hypofibrinolysis.	1.0537891003103943
The aim of our study was to investigate the influence that serum of patients with preeclampsia has on t-PA and PAI-1 expression from human endothelial cells.	0.9018653369047295
For this purpose, we cultured human endothelium cells, gained from umbilical veins, for 24 h with sera of 7 patients with HELLP syndrome and 12 patients with preeclampsia.	1.0999020678850322
The sera of 12 normotensive pregnant patients and 9 non-pregnant women were used as controls.	0.8936655962479979
We then determined t-PA and PAI-1 levels by ELISA, both in the maternal serum and in the supernatant of the endothelial cell cultures.	0.9161559099075904
While t-PA levels were significantly higher in the serum of patients with preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome than in the control group (median: 8.0 ng/ml and 6.2 ng/ml vs 3.9 ng/ml and 3.1 ng/ml), levels of PAI-1 did not show any significant disparity among the different groups.	1.2014561139400564
The supernatant of the endothelial cell cultures demonstrated significantly elevated levels of both t-PA (P<0.001) and PAI-1 (P<0.01) when stimulated with serum gained from patients with preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome.	0.9689015290033516
The increased expression of t-PA and PAI-1 from human endothelium cells after stimulation with the serum of preeclamptic patients must be considered as a sign of increased endothelial cell activation.	0.9378062404578265
Postoperative pain relief can be achieved by several methods, including the use of systemic opioids and regional anaesthesia with intrathecal or epidural opioids or local anaesthetics.	1.1183471162350345
On-demand analgesia using a PCA (patient-controlled analgesia) system is regarded as the ideal option for systemic opioid analgesia.	1.0124743058985208
While PCA devices are not yet commonly used in all recovery units, the use of repetitive boluses on demand is still the most frequent form of administration in postoperative pain therapy.	1.130416535853511
The objective of the present study was to show if continuous infusion of the opioid tramadol could produce better analgesia than repetitive administration of boluses.	1.1228715443596853
In a study under double-blind conditions 135 ASA I and II patients were assigned at random to group I (infusion group) or group B (bolus group) when they first requested pain treatment after abdominal surgery.	1.097031792108559
The patients in group I received an initial intravenous loading dose of 100 mg tramadol, followed by an infusion of 12 mg/h tramadol for 24 h; if necessary, repeated boluses of 50 mg tramadol were given.	1.14016528516876
In group B the patients received a placebo infusion instead of the tramadol infusion; otherwise, the procedure was the same.	1.2916236185501495
Pain relief was monitored by means of a VAS (visual analogue scale) up to 6 h after surgery.	1.0710230037638506
We investigated the retrograde assessment of analgesia by the patients after 6 h, how often repetitive boluses were required, and the amount of analgesics administered in 6 and 24 h. Results.	1.2099362905638602
The pain relief was assessed as excellent or good by 76.5% of group I and 65.6% of group B; 19.1% of group I and 26.9% of group B assessed the analgesic effect as satisfactory; 4.4% of group I and 7.5% of group B complained of insufficient analgesia.	1.3452934120181186
In group I 69.2% requested only one or no repetitive bolus, compared with 40.3% in group B, while two or more boluses were demanded by 30.8% in group I and 59.7% in group B.	1.2568365091100664
The average analgesic consumption after 6 h was 223.5 +/- 53.7 mg tramadol in group I and 176.6 +/- 63.1 mg tramadol in group B, respectively.	0.9743906905753074
After 24 h it was 449.5 +/- 66.0 mg tramadol in group I and 201.6 +/- 83.9 mg tramadol in group B.	0.9343421508947793
While the consumption during the first 6 h was comparable, from then on the consumption in group I increased significantly.	1.1820520144366733
Side effects were reported by 25% in both groups.	1.2023050385047434
They were clinically irrelevant and did not necessitate termination of the clinical trial in any case.	0.9323620964043147
During the study period pulse and blood pressure remained within the normal range and did not show any significant changes.	1.019548526150409
The fact that the patients in group I requested far fewer repetitive boluses than those in group B and the assessment by the patients led to the conclusion that treatment in the infusion group is better than that in the bolus group.	1.3142164122854845
Concerns that a significantly higher consumption of analgesics would cause unwanted side-effects have proven unfounded.	0.9038986246205787
Six hours after surgery, when analgesia was evaluated by the patients, there was no significant difference between the two groups.	0.95713214780529
Not until the maintenance infusion had been administered for a further 18 h, was the tramadol consumption within the infusion group significantly higher.	1.0939429784699568
Thus, we should consider continuing unreduced administration of the maintenance infusion 6 h after operation.	1.2579481149414866
The concept of tuberculid was introduced by Darier in 1896.	0.67827591923552
In contrast to "true" cutaneous tuberculosis, properties of the tuberculids were explained by an hyperergic response to myobacteria or their fragments released from a different site of manifest or passed tuberculous infection.	0.9560969713259859
Key features include a strongly positive tuberculin skin test, evidence of concomitant manifest or past tuberculosis, and prompt response to antituberculous therapy The inability to culture M. tuberculosis or to demonstrate it microscopically from lesional biopsies, together with reports on tuberculid-like eruptions after BCG vaccination, supports this concept.	0.9310782032198448
Clinical manifestations are lichen scrophulosorum, papulo-necrotic tuberculids and erythema induratum of Bazin.	0.7055530138272723
The existence of tuberculids has been questioned, however, because the clinical and histological appearances are not always specific.	1.338134741148183
An increasing number of case reports on tuberculids, new immunological tests and molecular biology-based techniques for the detection of mycobacteria have shed new light on the tuberculid concept.	0.9449316114233698
Case Report: A 20-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital because of a pneumothorax.	1.1782137295727522
A secondary amenorrhea was coexisting.	0.428436766735285
On the abdominal wall and in the anogenital area a maculopapular exanthema was visible.	0.9046449680669203
Chest X-ray and HR-CT showed a interstitial lung disease with high probability of histiocytosis X which was confirmed by biopsies of lung and skin tissue.	1.0060027793323791
The cause of amenorrhea was a histiocytic infiltration of the pituitary stalk.	0.8551258731326171
Conventional "consensus-treatment" for adults with vinblastine, prednisone and etoposide did not prevent relapsing bilateral pneumothoraces.	0.8858207660801486
Treatment was successful with the protocol as proposed by the international study for children.	0.898233984343308
This treatment is characterized by higher dosage and combination with 6-mercaptopurine.	0.9512205835548591
The prognosis of patients with malignant diseases requiring treatment on intensive care units is poor.	1.1614271704810875
The hospital mortality for mechanically ventilated patients ranges from 70-90% in patients with solid tumors to 75-90% in patients with hematological malignancy and up to 95% in patients after bone marrow transplantation.	1.2047629123427042
The number of patients referred to intensive care units is however increasing, due to improvements in the general treatment of malignant diseases.	1.1336529005525326
This results in controversies about the utilization of intensive care treatment in these patients.	1.0228459355450605
Since the individual outcome can not be predicted prior to initiation of intensive care therapy a general refusal of intensive care treatment seems not justified.	0.9593969135625773
A reevaluation of the patients status after initiation of intensive care treatment based on predefined criteria may however be useful in the decision about continuing intensive care measures.	1.1308425138869496
Patients requiring mechanical ventilation after bone marrow transplantation will not survive if prolonged treatment with vasopressors is necessary and/or sustained hepatic and renal failure is present.	0.9812646138830033
For these patients a withdrawal of further life support may be considered.	1.0351157102267357
Intensive care treatment should be continued in patients not fulfilling these criteria and treatment results are comparable to those in patients without malignant diseases.	1.1552001518968775
For other patients with malignant diseases the use of a new score system developed for patients with cancer can be helpful in the clinical decision making.	1.235330357075859
On the basis of a solution-oriented marital therapy, the different within-session effects of four different types of questions in systemic therapy (lineal, strategic, circular, and reflexive), as described by Tomm (1989), were tested.	1.2324505350719814
In this single case study, the method of plan analysis (Caspar 1989) was used to categorize the client's reactions to the four types of therapeutic questions.	1.1503482323521523
Lineal and strategic questions were expected to have a stabilizing and restraining effect on the system (i.e.	0.8317216894609509
the client, the clients' interaction, and the therapeutic interaction), whereas circular and reflexive questions were expected to open the system for change.	1.3648672027627986
Interestingly this hypothesis was only supported for the wife, who had the role of the identified client in the therapy and demonstrated a much stronger motivation for change.	1.2021235787039497
For the husband, who preferred the role of a cotherapist and demonstrated only little motivation for change, results were not as predicted.	1.035835612765568
Some of his reactions were even opposite to the expected therapeutic effects.	0.8333739247479818
Therefore, it is suggested that an interaction effect between questions and the motivation for change can be assumed.	1.246306540547726
Prerequisites for experimental study designs are extremely difficult to realise under prehospital emergency conditions.	0.7373382302309863
Results obtained in animal experiments always need validation with prehospital or inhospital patient studies.	0.8142033338700309
Investigations related to emergency medicine are, however, an ethical obligation on behalf of the patient.	1.0405705840410477
A retrospective analysis of the available literature should be considered a prerequisite for prospective randomised and controlled studies.	1.259500152680133
Frequently, a pilot study or feasibility trial needs to precede the actual study.	0.9779157740858232
Informed consent must be obtained for all patient studies.	0.7397504516463929
However, under emergency conditions informed consent cannot always be obtained due to unconsciousness, etc.	1.0102527300774167
Nevertheless, the following principles should be observed: (a) randomised studies are essential, even in emergency medicine; (b) they are ethically acceptable if the treatment provided for the study group is at least equivalent to the therapy for the control group; ( c) only these preconditions guarantee that the patient always receives treatment in accordance with the standard of treatment.	1.3930411807615972
If the patient is unconscious or otherwise unable to give informed consent, the principle of deferred consent is acceptable.	0.9690693824633122
The deferred consent principle should be carefully documented.	0.6799868517558703
A prospective randomized study represents the gold standard for an investigation, even under emergency conditions.	1.1241092478747399
There are different principles of randomization: telephone or telefax randomisation, etc.	0.7234674267897953
Emergency medicine investigations need to be completed within a reasonable time frame which should, as a rule, not exceed 2 years.	1.2508561946552692
Otherwise, too many items might change without being noted.	0.9393048788878122
Curative treatment and the intention to treat are terms employed by ethics committees.	0.9119099905956701
If an investigation does not bear in itself additional risk factors, it does not necessarily have to be brought before the ethics committee.	0.9686396803763782
If, however, for example, the effect of obtaining blood samples is investigated separately for research purposes, the patient needs to be informed and sign the respective agreement.	1.1719873086379207
In Germany the ethics committees have agreed to accept their respective decisions.	0.8709460975861787
For multicentre and multinational studies, however, the ethics committees also need to accept decisions made by non-German ethics committees.	0.9142635647992597
Not all therapeutic principles can serve as the basis of prospective randomized studies because they need to be considered the present standard of care (e.g., endotracheal intubation, etc.).	1.0517278099176341
Nevertheless, the feasibility of a study should be assessed according to the 1-3 rating proposed by the American Heart Association.	1.1065792571362538
In principle, the overall emergency physician protocol does not fulfill scientific requirements.	0.9818847547465499
For all studies, particularly in the prehospital setting, an independent observer should be involved for documentation purposes.	1.036281497825368
Scores can be of importance for investigating different treatment regimens.	0.9421817758928664
Biases in emergency medicine studies focus on the variability of EMS, personnel qualifications, etc.	0.7866997600629746
This is in part why it is extremely difficult to prove efficacy and efficiency in emergency medicine.	0.9388888351343595
The results of emergency medicine investigations should be published in suitable journals, i.e., journals with a reasonable rating.	1.0918420571771517
New antifungals for oral therapy have improved the chances of healing onychomycoses.	0.8443187142659306
Nevertheless, in daily practice the failure rate is 20-30% both with itraconazole and terbinafine.	1.2615525662071858
In our investigations for the fungicidal effects of terbinafine, we could show that the same strain of Trichophyton rubrum or T. mentagrophytes in the rest period needs 1000 times higher concentration of terbinafine (2,0 to 0,002 µg/ml) for complete fungal killing as in the growth phase.	1.1800365901995409
Thus resting fungi in the nail are not harmed, and if the concentration of terbinafine is lower than the MIC for the fungi, they can cause a relapse.	1.1411038972046914
Itraconazole is a fungistatic agent.	0.587317780358084
Its concentration in the nail plate must be higher than the MIC for the causative fungi for a long time - 10 to 12 months.	1.1639102912785206
The usual short-term treatment of onychomycosis over 3 months can be insufficient in individual cases such as patients with disorders, e.g.	0.9028393086887604
circulatory disorders or slowed nail growth.	0.587030575826435
This paper presents an algorithm for automatic switching between atrial tracking and nontracking pacing mode based on a "4 out of 7" concept: if 4 out of 7 atrial intervals are sensed below a critical value, mode switching (MS) is automatically performed.	0.9890401744727111
The technical solution in Medtronic Kappa 700 dual chamber devices is explained together with an evaluation of advantages and possible limitations.	0.8281785860044959
The "4 out of 7" algorithm offers a quick MS; by the addition of a "blanked flutter search" algorithm integrated into this concept, the detection of atrial flutter is facilitated in a wider range of programmed AV intervals.	1.015358884596696
With the increased rapidity of MS and sensitivity towards atrial flutter detection, there is also an increased propensity to switch to the nontracking mode in case of short atrial runs and frequent premature atrial beats.	1.039750823018084
Therefore, to optimize the MS function, programming of the device (e.g., activation of a time delay before MS) should be carried out individually with respect to the intrinsic rhythm and arrhythmia of the patient.	1.185486824315304
Possible interactions between different programmable parameters should also be taken into consideration.	0.7535668630651166
Some guidelines are presented in this paper.	0.743707213131754
Finally, the use of extended stored diagnostic data seems to be crucial to evaluate pacemaker performance, incidence of atrial arrhythmias, and (as far as possible) confirmation of the stored data themselves by assessment of stored intracardiac electrograms.	1.103787836603484
Between 1983 and 1991 ten patients with chronic frontal sinus disease underwent frontal osteoplastic flaps with fat obliteration.	0.9689703854569514
In order to judge operative success on a long-term basis all patients were called for postoperative follow-up.	1.013497392526357
They then completed a questionaire, in which they were asked about postoperative complaints.	1.1466211384321052
Additionally, sinuses were examined by computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MR).	0.9349090915797672
Among the patients evaluated seven had no complaints, and no evidence of disease could be found by medical examination.	1.2335721903569337
CT scans showed complete obliteration of the frontal sinuses in all patients.	0.9784381467185166
In these patients, two-thirds of the fat had been replaced by connective tissue.	0.8014512742968791
MR was used in an attempt to show evidence for suppurative disease in the frontal sinus, but the MR images failed to correlate with symptoms.	1.223084184315497
Additional results could not be obtained when compared to CT.	0.8419241729368188
Overall operating success could only be determined by clinical assessment and confirmed the value of the frontal osteoplastic flap with fat obliteration.	1.0388602513938074
The objective of our trial was to evaluate the significance and usefulness of sentinel lymphadenectomy (SLNE) for the staging of regional lymph nodes in breast cancer patients.	1.1113769202258683
The study presented illustrates the method and our results.	0.9636415242990755
As has been documentated for melanoma, the first lymph node [sentinel node (SLN)] to receive lymphatic drainage from a primary tumor is the expected first site of lymph-node metastasis.	1.097614391360321
The database presented includes 12 patients with operable breast cancer and clinically negative lymph nodes.	0.8476269707687714
In 11 cases the described method was applicable.	0.8817353983592625
In only one case was there no correlation between the histology of the SLN and the axillary specimen.	1.000640339432371
Successful completion of examination of a large number of patients with a long follow-up has the potential of reducing the number of axillary dissections and of significantly reducing morbidity in the majority of breast cancer patients.	1.2006559292308623
Background: Information on the extent and degree of the thermal effect produced is of great importance for control of the laser dosage in laser thermokeratoplasty (LTK) and for postoperative follow-up.	1.2442854986874983
We investigated on acute LTK effects which information images obtained by optical low coherence tomography (OCT) offer compared to those obtained by polarization microscopy.	0.9741486028744725
In cases with protected left main stenosis by previous bypass surgery or as an emergency intervention in patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is performed as an alternative treatment strategy to bypass surgery.	1.1068949695991315
A review of 262 left main angioplasties revealed a procedure-related mortality in cases without protection of the left main coronary artery of 9.1% (4/44), in cases with partially protected left main stenosis by collaterals to either left coronary artery of 4.8% (1/21) and 0.5% (1/187) in cases with nonobstructed bypass grafts to either left coronary artery.	1.3297152012405917
Coronary angioplasty of an unprotected left main coronary artery, had an unacceptably high procedure-related mortality rate and should therefore not be performed even in cases of emergency intervention.	1.0801008496878506
The risk stratification of the procedure can be evaluated by the proposed grading of left main artery protection.	1.1678102397573826
Hypocalcemia is a relatively uncommon reversible cause of congestive heart failure.	0.7810561737376419
There are a few reports of hypocalcemic children who developed congestive heart failure associated with hypoparathyroidism.	0.9406085432228949
In all these patients, however, cardiac failure did not occur before the age of nine years.	1.1767138297788946
In addition, other striking noncardial manifestations of hypoparathyroidism, e.g., convulsive seizures, had been present prior to cardiac symptoms.	1.1764012188022155
In this publication, Nager syndrome was analyzed in the literature and six patients from our clinic were evaluated in relation to symptoms, etiology and pathogenesis.	1.176007074784089
The diseases to be considered when making a differential diagnostis are pointed out.	0.9634246270703809
Clarification of the etiology is still pending.	0.8976918494334142
Molecular genetic research in these patients is possibly the key for new findings.	0.9538421176627109
A case report illustrates the results of interdisciplinary treatment by the surgeon and orthodontist.	1.2291742728546515
Possibilities and problems in relation to therapy are demonstrated.	0.8687898547370964
The results of ankle arthroplasty have generally been disappointing compared to other forms of arthroplasty.	0.9240619125549435
The present survey of results of ankle arthroplasty deals with the anatomical, the kinemasiological the biomechanical and the biological features of the ankle joint.	1.061403212183165
These features all seem important prerequisites for a successful total ankle prosthesis design.	0.8042997771942222
From the study of the results displayed in the literature and those of my own series it can be stated that a modern ankle arthroplasty should respect the normal anatomy and kinemasiology.	1.1696865628618607
Biomechanically it should work as a normal ankle joint i. e. cylindrical mobility, congruency and a possibility for normal torque within the ankle mortise.	0.9461197101664243
The prosthesis components should only be fixed in solid subchondral bone, and preferably without cement.	0.9194576835579608
Only compressible forces should act at the bone-prosthesis interface.	0.8294838989098129
The axis of the ankle joint as well as of that of the hindfoot should be aligned to normal.	1.2471370554800874
Meticulous surgery and special guide instruments are absolute necessities.	0.7412752767918196
Restoration of muscle power and gait postoperatively are essential for a good and lasting result.	0.948025117947757
The indication for ankle arthroplasty is mainly cases of osteoarthritis (primary or traumatic) and rheumatoid arthritis.	1.0355562196018147
Contraindications are talus necrosis, Charcot joints, extreme osteoporosis, severe arteriosclerosis, and very aggressive arthritis.	0.9444360000009181
Mental disorders and neurological disorders may also be contraindications.	0.8274223393791329
Furthermore, the patients should agree not to perform sports involving jumping and running or other ankle demanding activities.	1.1245370389492746
The average annual failure rate should not exceed 1 % if these recommendations are followed.	1.1521804518369871
Elbow flexion plays a key role in the overall function of the upper extremity.	1.0122504038261129
In the case of unilateral complete brachial plexus lesion, restoration of elbow flexion will dramatically increase the patient's chances of regaining bimanual prehension.	0.9611232305971881
Furthermore, depending on the type of reconstruction, stability of the glenohumeral joint as well as some supination function of the forearm can be restored to a varying degree at the same time.	1.0394623083431989
Depending on the level of brachial plexus lesion and/or reinnervation, different reconstructive procedures are available.	0.9567323382269205
In order to select the best treatment option for the patient it is necessary to known the extent of the lesion of the brachial plexus and/or ventral upper arm muscles, to time the operation appropriately, to be aware of all treatment possibilities and to recall the special problems of tendon transfer for brachial plexus patients.	1.1690021147411613
Our concept is based on our experience with more than 1100 patients presenting a brachial plexus lesion between 1981 and 1996 and treated in our institution.	1.019036438404973
There were 528 operative revisions of the brachial plexus.	0.6490196804239108
Some 225 patients underwent secondary muscle/tendon transfers.	0.7231617343897777
In 35 patients elbow flexion was reconstructed by bipolar latissimus dorsi transfer (n = 10), triceps-to-biceps transfer (n = 15), modified flexor/pronator muscle mass proximalization (n = 6) and multiple-stage free functional muscle transfer after intercostal nerve transfer (n = 4).	1.1506287155262211
The official German guidelines for prevention of intravascular-device-associated infections were published by the Bundesgesundheitsamt, now called the Robert-Koch-Institut, 12 years ago.	0.744297936113815
The recently published official "Guidelines for Prevention of Intravascular-Device Associated Infections" of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are categorized according to scientific evidence.	0.6751515333127941
The American guidelines are very detailed and differ in some aspects from the offical German guidelines.	0.5075416672039958
The purpose of the present paper is to inform the German-speaking anaesthesiologist about the official CDC guidelines and to provide an update on the prevention of intravascular-device-associated infections.	0.9059571021381764
We assessed the interindividual diagnostic variance of 39 experienced arthroscopists by the Kappa Cohen interobserver variation analysis using videotapes of eight different patients with different diagnoses.	0.8625205851490472
Arthroscopically normal findings showed a relatively acceptable interobserver correlation.	0.8222319525807441
Pathological changes, in contrast, often showed very little correlation, especially in the synovial membrane of the suprapatellar recess, in the cartilage of the femoropatellar groove and the posterior cruciate ligament.	1.3155413201977528
In patellar alignment there was also great interobserver variation.	0.8760000974730069
Clinical relevance: When comparing arthroscopic findings with other imaging techniques the above results should be taken into account.	0.8793694386481344
Furthermore, these results will affect the significance of medical expertise based only on pictures.	1.2603531803176675
In addition, medical cost billing, which is based on arthroscopic findings, has to take into account that a wrong diagnosis is possible and therefore charges will be wrong.	1.3387131806578518
Squamous metaplasia can be demonstrated in about 4% of all invasive carcinomas of the breast.	1.4203838071493013
Primary squamous cell carcinomas of the breast are rare, since they occur in less than 1% of all primary invasive breast carcinomas.	1.2634526836677837
In order to classify a breast tumor as a primary squamous cell carcinoma one must exclude an epidermal origin, especially from the nipple region and the possibility of metastatic infiltration of the breast by a squamous cell carcnoma from a different location.	1.1813293428993152
Causative and formal pathogenesis of primary squamous cell carcinoma of the breast is not clear.	1.0002855290956998
A pluripotent embryonal stem cell origin is discussed, considering the phylogenetic descent of the mammary gland from skin appendages.	0.7667614962208198
Squamous metaplasia is also suggested to be a precursor of squamous cell carcinoma.	0.9710126813557409
Here endocrine stimulation and chronic inflammation may both play an inductive role.	0.8401250233110248
The number of published cases of squamous cell carcinomas developing years and decades after implantation of silicon prostheses has increased in recent years.	0.9411159675121925
These tumors probably develop on top of squamous metaplasia induced by the inflammatory pseudocapsule.	0.8525119528051752
The limited success of thrombolytic therapy and the high percentage of patients who have to be excluded from lysis has resulted in the alternative application of primary PTCA in acute myocardial infarction.	1.127831656342964
Randomized studies so far available have shown a significant decrease of hospital mortality by primary PTCA as compared to thrombolysis.	1.0643495067784954
Adjuvant stent implantation and a wider administration of glycoprotein IIA/IIIB inhibitors may further reduce mortality.	0.8449794919650553
For logistic and financial reasons however, not all patients with acute myocardial infarction can benefit from this therapeutic approach in spite of the high density of health care in Germany.	1.2729430385401765
Primary PTCA in acute myocardial infarction should be left to experienced centres and investigators.	0.6771039413585724
Of utmost importance is a reduction of the present "onset-to-opening" times by information campaigns, an improved triage, use of transportation times for pre-hospital lysis and improved thrombolytic agents.	1.0805656258575178
Some 245,000 sporting accidents occur yearly in Switzerland.	0.6705072719702302
The social accident costs amount to approximately 1.8 billion francs per year.	0.8904630590832718
Every second sporting accident occurs during a ball game.	0.7023445809169635
For the shown sporting activities, distortion is the most common type of injury among adults and contained fractures are most common in children.	1.056503773021159
As is to be expected, the number of accidents has grown along with the exploding popularity of snowboarding and in-line skating.	1.1006357918756133
These new sporting activities show no unknown injury patterns which would demand new treatment methods.	0.7920396880496919
Abstract:  The combination of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows the localization and functional characterization of the somatosensory and motor cortex.	0.9794942084759847
However, this method is technically pretentious and time consuming.	1.2949853358236334
Therefore, functional imaging is still not established as routine procedure in neurosurgery.	1.3803017835477307
The aim of the presented study was the development of a protocol, which allows the integration of functional MEG data into presurgical planning and intraoperative navigation, as a routine method.	1.4408266515806871
We report on a 15-year-old girl and her relatives with typical features of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIII.	1.0279052567451068
Main symptoms of this disorder are fragile skin, easy bruisability, joint hypermobility, features suggesting premature aging, and periodontal disease with early loss of teeth.	1.0042291428815981
The inheritance of this type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is autosomal dominant.	0.7499497747028225
The biochemical and genetic defects have not yet been elucidated.	0.9045011614098489
The acute liver failure (ALF) is a complex syndrome resulting from loss of synthetic and metabolic functions of the liver.	1.020664505092638
Despite recent advances in intensive care medicine patients with severe ALF have a very high mortality and the orthotopic liver transplantation still remains the only proven effective treatment of ALF.	1.1181475212326346
Numerous attempts have been made to improve survival by using various extracorporeal support techniques, but none of these therapeutic approaches was able to increase the survival rate.	1.143124201078468
Liver support systems based on detoxification procedures only could not influence the deleterious course of the disease.	0.7939024683298945
It is certain that an ideal liver support system should be capable to fulfil the liver's essential synthetic and metabolic functions as well as detoxification and excretion.	0.8593623909002943
Over the last years the development of hybrid liver assist devices has aimed at replacing these liver functions and therefore might give an advantage over earlier systems based on detoxification techniques only.	0.9411606443584479
This article gives a short review of the various liver support systems and focuses then on the hybrid liver support systems, their construction and the remaining problems after the first clinical applications.	1.1334466363521438
After a latency period of 20 years, in a 39-year-old Austrian citizen of Chinese origin, a surgically removed rectal carcinoma, as well as the neighboring chronic inflammatory rectal mucosa with various degrees of dysplasia and one positive neighboring lymph node, showed helminthiasis in the histopathological examination, convincing us of a link between carcinoma and chronic helminthiasis.	1.115714216706193
Whereas the etiological context between chronic infection by Schistosoma haematobium and endemic frequent urinary bladder carcinoma is considered a matter of fact, whether of not the incidence of intestinal carcinoma is increased in connection with chronic intestinal schistosomiasis is controversial.	1.0256952759739737
The etiological and pathogenetic link between helminthiasis and carcinoma should be considered in the same way as for other related inflammatory large-bowel diseases.	0.9950244799697576
In the sequence chronic inflammation - severe dysplasia, the formation of carcinoma could possibly occur.	1.1238238264123472
Besides a survey of trematodes parasitology and pathology, the link between rectal carcinoma and Schistosomiasis japonicum is pointed out by means of appropriate literature investigations.	0.8889199526877769
Rupture of the carotid artery wall is a very rare postoperative complication.	0.9401911455325969
Mainly ruptures of vein patches are described in the literature.	0.6620769860204441
This paper reports on a 51-year-old patient with elective endarterectomy of the left internal carotid artery using V-Y technique.	1.1660375864629478
On day 8 after operation, the carotid bulb ruptured.	0.8853066184283745
The suture line was not involved.	0.5610112556375784
The rupture was due to local wall necrosis, as verified by histologic examination.	0.950492136650442
In an emergency procedure the necrotized tissue was resected and repaired using a Dacron patch.	0.9604548907256761
Postoperatively the patient showed paresis of the left recurrent nerve but fortunately did not suffer any other neurological deficit.	1.04588056933606
Myocardial stunning (contractile dysfunction in the presence of normalized perfusion) and myocardial hibernation (contractile dysfunction matching reduced perfusion) have represented separate concepts of viable, but dyssynergic myocardium in the past.	1.0964390262234063
However, in vivo experimental and clinical work suggests that repetitive ischemia due to coronary artery disease may induce a gradual transition between stunned and hibernating myocardium.	1.0660475405166567
Myocardial hibernation itself can result from a spectrum of ischemic conditions ranging from impaired myocardial blood flow reserve to frank hypoperfusion.	0.8124302206933295
With increasing severity and duration of ischemia, degeneration of cardiac myocytes, accumulation of glycogen and cell death ensue.	0.9291717327676794
Additonally, there is an increase of extracellular matrix protein content leading to reparative fibrosis, which in turn limits functional recovery.	1.0451174469141662
In the light of these structural features, the available methods for detection of viable myocardium, in particular dobutamine echocardiography and nuclear imaging techniques, offer complementary rather than contradictory information.	1.1453941629773308
Dobutamine echo has satisfactory sensitivity, excellent specificity, and high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of viable dyssynergic myocardium.	1.057336476620724
While in the past only its predictive accuracy for segmental recovery has been validated, newer data show an improved survival after revascularization if at least four viable dyssynergic left ventricular segments in a 16 segment model can be identified by dobutamine echocardiography.	1.0204854260669607
The complete (low and high dose) dobutamine protocol can elicit several types of contractile responses (sustained improvement in contraction or monophasic response, biphasic response, new wall motion abnormality) which should be interpreted in view of other clinical data including a previous infarction.	1.0987474539890734
The test protocol can be used safely at the end of the first week after myocardial infarction.	1.1499881071343623
If ischemia or viability is documented, revascularization should be performed promptly.	0.8688073452355349
A similar strategy should be followed in the setting of chronic coronary heart disease with left ventricular dysfunction.	0.915371178211612
Since the structural changes of hibernating myocardium are progressive, time to revascularization is critical.	0.8884357097835934
On the other hand, responsible therapeutic planning requires proof of ischemia or viability before initiating a potentially hazardous revascularization procedure.	0.7798916257804751
The coarctation of the aorta is a congenital narrowing of the aorta in the transitional area between the distal aortic arch and the proximal descending aorta.	1.0838082416514911
The coarctation causes an arterial hypertension of the upper half and an arterial hypotension of the lower half of the body.	1.2219260120745952
The indication for operative repair is given because of the hypertension with strain and possible insufficiency of the heart.	1.028320759824635
The resection of the narrowed part of the aorta with end-to-end anastomosis or interposition of a prosthesis brings on the risk of a recoarctation.	1.0323044551487945
After a Vosschulte-aortoplasty a recurrent coarctation is rarely seen.	0.7339559414813657
This method, however, brings on a higher risk of the development of an aneurysm.	1.1561982023555384
In the following it is reported about a patient who underwent an operation due to an aneurysm 22 years after a Vosschulte-aortoplasty.	1.1648651292080099
The aging of the Italian population is an emerging public health priority.	0.7763206724891101
In 2025 Italy is expected to have the highest world median age with nearly half of the population over 50 years old.	1.065862517032755
To avoid an unbearable burden of disease and disability on future generations, we must identify areas for intensive disease and disability prevention programs.	1.1344798508820773
A 14 year old macedonic girl was admitted with recurrent colicky abdominal pain that had lasted for several weeks.	0.8536500368800801
Laboratory check, plain abdominal film and abdominal sonography did not show abnormalitities immediately.	0.8989385843644523
Increasing enzyme parameters though indicated cholestasis.	0.5487207639085876
Endoscopic retrograde choledocho-pancreaticography (ERCP) was performed after abdominal sonography showed a dilatation of the choledochus.	1.0794634855610377
It revealed a common-channel situation (ductus choledochus and pancreaticus) and choledocholithiasis.	0.9289363287176994
Papillotomy and stone-extraction could not remove abdominal pain.	0.7022670048692728
Laparatomy and choledocho-jejunostomy could finally remove the symptoms.	0.6025837076442107
Successful transplantation of autologous chondrocytes for repair of articular cartilage defects requires an undisturbed matrix-synthesis of the transplanted cells.	0.9487441910741545
This, in turn, is dependent on the composition of the synovial fluid (SF) of the respective joint.	1.3581241047279644
We addressed the question whether analysis of a patient's SF can predict the rate of matrix-synthesis of articular cartilage exposed to this SF in vitro.	1.0895481317999745
SF was obtained from 115 patients with disorders of the knee, including gonarthrosis (n = 44), meniscal tears (n = 10), rheumatoid arthritis (n = 53), and reactive arthritides (n = 8).	1.2589663424916298
In the SF, the following parameters were determined: Interleukin-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1-RA, TNF, Insulin-like growth-factor I (IGF-I), IGF-II, IGF-binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2), IGFBP-3 as well as total proteinase activity and total collagenase activity.	1.193487371775471
To assess the effect of SF on the matrix synthesis of articular chondrocytes, bovine cartilage was incubated in the presence of SF, and the rate of proteoglycan synthesis subsequently determined.	1.0260224944851262
In some cases, a monoclonal antibody directed against IGF-I was added.	0.8742633561281081
SF from patients with OA or trauma, respectively, stimulated PG-synthesis of bovine cartilage more markedly than did SF from patients with rheumatic arthritides.	0.901747650409937
On the average, 60 percent of the SF-induced increase of cartilage matrix synthesis could be titrated out by an anti-IGF-I-AB.	0.9943453180353121
The best predictor for the SF-effects on PG-synthesis of exposed cartilage was the proportion of free IGF-I (r = 0.573, p < 0.001, Spearman rank correlation) followed by the SF-concentrations of IGF-I (with a positive sign), IGFBP-3, IL-1, and TNF (all with a negative sign).	1.048597713870777
According to our data, IGF-I is the most important anabolic factor in human SF with respect to cartilage PG-synthesis.	1.0334514780162805
The proportion of free IGF-I seems to be of special importance in this regard.	0.8007487273853036
Low SF-levels of free IGF-I could be identified as a possible risk-factor for a sub-optimal protoeglycan synthesis of chondrocytes exposed to this synovial milieu.	0.9713216694535843
The coincidence between panic disorder and depression is a well known phenomenon.	0.8065014205598191
However, only few studies investigated the coincidence of panic disorder with schizophrenia.	1.267019363356882
This may in part be explained by the fact that both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia may mask the clinical symptoms of a panic disorder.	0.9806071073505982
We report on a female patient suffering both from agoraphobia with panic disorder and paranoid schizophrenia according to ICD-10.	0.9985388323161025
The productive psychotic symptoms responded well to treatment with a low dose of zotepine, whereas the panic disorder was effectively treated with a combined therapy with imipramine and cognitive behavioral therapy.	1.1431051605265643
Although it has to be questioned whether the coincidence between panic disorder and schizophrenia reflects two different diagnostic entities, the occurence of symptoms of a panic disorder in schizophrenia deserve further attention because these may be treated efficiently by a specific pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy.	0.9646613072381277
A 54-year-old female patient with a 10-year history of ventriculoperitoneal shunt resulting from communicating hydrocephalus of undetermined aetiology is reported.	0.9066388383644024
Transient gait disturbances and cerebral infarction at the age of 46 did not lead to further insights into the nature of the disease.	0.9070703571565578
After many years with only occasional disturbances, a distinct organic brain syndrome developed.	0.947581650622375
Thorough examination led to a tentative diagnosis of neurocysticercosis; this was based on the history, liquor diagnosis and cerebral microcalcifications in CT.	1.0640141399184786
Despite the initiation of specific therapy, the patient died of the sequelae of the disease.	1.2422577431823099
At autopsy, characteristic cicatricial residues of mainly basal leptomeningitis were found with collapsed parasitic cysts.	0.8399098382509026
Additional intracerebral mesenchymal-glial reactions were less conspicuous.	0.7037904981265269
Residual ependymitis had caused aqueductal stenosis.	0.546117998604234
Death was due to cachexia, bronchopneumonia and a lung abscess.	0.7358193626563045
The clinical course and morphology of neurocysticercosis are discussed.	1.0441373936727185
The disease has become rare in our country, but is globally the most important parasitic disease of the central nervous system.	1.1423375466929662
The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the incidence, etiology and prognosis of severe connatal anemia in preterm and term children.	1.0365779088243505
All neonates born in the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University of Kiel, were included.	1.0280127768988314
In 18 of 18 367 (0.98 permil) liveborn neonates (birth weight 680-4050 g; 26-41 weeks of gestation), the initial hemoglobin level was below 10 g/dl.	1.078113224117135
In those children with birth weight below 2500 g the incidence was 6.8 permil.	0.9286952706300101
In 17 of 18 cases the cause of anemia could be clarified.	0.9405880630106845
In five preterm babies (28%) an acute fetofetal transfusion and in three newborns a fetomaternal transfusion was responsible for the onset of anemia.	1.0855299395272688
In two cases there was Rh incompatibility, in two cases placental bleeding, and in another two cases fetal tumour bleeding caused the anemia.	1.296245381986801
In one fully developed newborn there was severe disseminated intestinal bleeding of unknown cause.	0.7949590201701701
Another child suffered from EBV infection, and one had trisomy 13 with multiple malformations.	1.0482047976262698
Ten children (55%) had to be resuscitated due to hypovolemic shock.	1.001506507440798
Fifteen children were intubated and ventilated mechanically.	0.6528861955678313
Seven children (39%); (six preterm babies and the newborn with trisomy 13) died between days 1 and 6.	1.0500251544516457
Five of these seven children had to be resuscitated at birth.	0.9170687465658633
Six children (33%) showed evidence of neurologic disease when discharged; five of these were resuscitated previously.	1.1109318194769724
Five children (28%) including three full-term babies were developed normally.	1.0352479887182213
In conclusion, severe anemia with hemoglobin below 10 g/dl is very rare but serious.	1.104735031258364
It seems necessary to optimize primary resuscitation by immediate transfusion and monitoring of central venous pressure by umbilical vein catheter.	0.8712532636420077
The prognosis can be influenced in a positive way.	0.8814471307560281
Diagnosis of bacterial infection and/or sepsis in critically ill patients is a common problem in intensive care medicine.	0.9934314412052627
White blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are often used in the differential diagnosis of infection versus SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome) due to noninfectious causes.	1.1368434921381747
There is a number of non-infectious stimuli to cause leucocytosis and CRP elevation.	0.9505840183667777
In the last 3 years, Procalcitonin (PCT) was determined to be a marker of severe bacterial infection, especially sepsis.	1.353776093799821
PCT appears to have several advantages; it is of non-hepatic (yet unknown) origin and useful in patients with hepatic insufficiency.	1.1076505908203835
There is no PCT-increase in acute graft-rejection, viral disease, and autoimmune disorders.	1.0370342139680182
Some studys showed a prognostic value of PCT in sepsis due to peritonitis and pancreatitis.	0.8189523722378206
PCT appears to be a new and helpful tool in the diagnosis and treatment of critically ill patients.	0.9497110821537393
Further studies are needed to finally established PCT in the daily management of critically ill patients.	0.8143313040260887
At this time significantly higher costs are the major detraction to daily or frequent measurements.	0.9564421588090102
In this retrospective study, the meniscal status of 45 patients with conservatively treated complete anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears is reported.	0.8593956672709616
The ACL injury was initially documented by examination under anesthesia and arthroscopy.	0.8980615843967527
Treatment in all cases consisted of a standard protocol of early rehabilitation and bracing.	1.1401973986026788
The mean follow-up was 8 years.	0.9751365859320882
Twenty-nine (65%) patients showed signs of meniscal pathology at an average of 3 years after the ACL injury during the follow-up period.	1.1739756377213446
Rearthroscopy was performed and showed a higher incidence of medial meniscus tears.	1.0916216163192969
The most common tear of the medial meniscus was the bucket-handle type, followed by the flap tear and the single longitudinal split of the posterior horn.	1.1382239675982602
Secondary reconstruction of the ACL was necessary in 24 patients complaining of the meniscus giving way.	0.9513029549729921
The remaining five patients had rearthroscopy 4 years after the ACL injury and a partial meniscectomy and ACL reconstruction was performed.	1.0411148355125421
Sixteen patients (35% of the overall sample) had no instability complaints or meniscal pathology during the follow-up period, but discontinued their sporting activities.	1.1917852513767926
Results indicate the increasing incidence of meniscal tears during ACL insufficiency.	0.7544056490889308
We recommend that patients with ruptures of the ACL should be investigated for meniscal tears and that early ligament reconstruction of the knee and mensical repair or partial meniscectomy should be considered simultaneously.	1.2164198502716208
Four children, 4 to 10 years old, with chronic uveitis were treated with cyclosporin A (CsA; starting dosage 2 mg/kg per day) and prednisolone.	1.2451975592582334
All children had previously received systemic steroids and/or cytotoxic agents, which resulted either in a poor therapeutic effect or in intolerable side effects.	1.0239560442744828
In one child, suffering from uveitis in combination with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, a complete reduction of intraocular inflammation was achieved.	0.9703267140534462
In a second child treatment resulted in a marked reduction of inflammatory activity with stabilization of visual function, although a temporary increase in the steroid dosage was necessary at one stage.	1.0985057411398813
In the remaining two cases therapy failed to improve the intraocular inflammation.	1.0507503896521568
During the time of treatment, ranging from 11 to 26 months, no serious side effects were observed.	1.0952703562779584
All patients developed moderate hypertrichosis and one child gingival hyperplasia.	0.8235141303834372
In our <\d> experience, cyclosporin A (CsA) combined with low-dose systemic steroids is useful as a therapeutic alternative to steroids alone and to other immunosuppressive agents in severe cases of chronic uveitis in childhood.	1.1381802044257863
Allergic reactions in tattoos are comparatively rare.	0.5800851216747871
In most cases the reactions are caused by different red pigments.	1.0042544984955852
While in the past these reactions have been ascribed to mercury salts (cinnebar) and cadmium sulphide, now synthetic inorganic azo dyes have also been found to be responsible for such reactions.	1.0095242573668994
A 42-year-old man presented with an allergic reaction in the red parts of his tattoos.	0.9869541589360156
Histologically a chronic granulomatous, partly fibrous inflammation with transfollicular elimination of pigment granules was found.	0.809540759836212
Spontaneous regression in a part of the inflammatory reaction was observed, simultaneously with depigmentation and scarring of the overlying skin.	0.8577489392024085
The pigment used for tattooing was found to be an aromatic azo derivative.	1.0024664162505783
In addition to a positive cutaneous reaction to the dye, the patient also showed a positive patch test to Napthol AS, used for the coupling of different dyes in the textile industry.	1.2911650992047
Borrelia burgdorferi specific DNA has been detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in different specimens of patients with Lyme disease (LD).	1.0016576321452892
The aim of the present study is to evaluate PCR-diagnostic of urine specimens regarding rheumatologic diagnosis of Lyme disease.	1.1074944111982796
Urine specimens of 77 patients  (LD, n=34; undifferentiated arthritis (UA), n=25; arthralgia/myalgia (AM), n=18) and 15 controls were investigated.	1.2677812026923203
Flagellin gene  (60 specimens) or OspA-plasmid  (32 specimens) were used as targets.	1.488793803891597
Sensitivity of the flagellin-nested-PCR was 27%, by OspA-nested-PCR only one positive PCR result was found.	1.0572975537932279
Despite of low sensitivity PCR enabled the correct diagnosis of LD in two patients classified as UA.	0.9824043960087917
Therefore, PCR can give valuable hints in single cases if LD is clinically suspected.	1.0361279457526607
Objective: To assess the clinical efficacy of a chemically standardized willow bark extract in the treatment of osteoarthritis.	1.082009354323305
Methods: Willow bark extract, in a dose corresponding to 240mg salicin/day, was compared to placebo in a 2-week, double-blind, randomized controlled trial.	1.143305144159865
The primary outcome measure was the pain dimension of the WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index.	0.8812705367311745
Secondary outcome measures included the stiffness and physical function dimensions of the WOMAC, daily visual analogue scales (VAS) on pain and physical function, and final overall assessment by both patients and investigators.	1.1161018831955314
Results: 78 patients (39 willow bark extract, 39 placebo) participated in the trial.	1.1322153211011297
A statistically significant difference between active treatment and placebo group was observed in the WOMAC pain dimension (d=6.5mm, 95%C.I.=0.2-12.7mm, p=0.047); the WOMAC pain score was reduced by 14% from baseline level after two weeks of active treatment, compared to an increase of 2% in the placebo group.	1.2033982321932668
Patient diary VAS confirmed this result, and likewise the final overall assessments showed superiority of willow bark extract over placebo (patients assessment, p=0.0002; investigators assessment, p=0.0073).	0.9094712152163102
Conclusion: Willow bark extract shows a moderate analgesic effect in osteoarthritis.	1.0135575793809208
Background and methods: The aim of this study was to get more information about the prevalence of chronic pain in different practices of home physicians.	1.0687266484107263
900 patients of five different specialists (general medicine, internal medicine, neurology, orthopaedics, surgery) in the german town Bochum were investigated with a questionnaire about chronic pain.	1.1629475200935746
Chronic pain was defined as a continuous or intermittend pain of longer duration than six months.	0.9279144480719148
Confusion between syncope and epileptic seizures is a common problem in clinical practice.	0.892175133826347
Recently, new insights into the phenomenology of transient cerebral hypoxia have been gained from video analysis of experimentally induced syncope.	1.0112895392913694
Common elements of syncope include multifocal and generalized myoclonus, tonic body extension, automatisms, vocalizations, eye deviations and hallucinations.	0.8562239964630994
Thus, it is not the presence or absence of these features but their specific character that distinguishes syncope from epileptic seizures.	1.0503412310587388
Other clues for differential diagnosis include precipitating factors, premonitory symptoms and postictal events, such as tongue bites and postictal confusion, which has been identified as the single most powerful factor discriminating syncope from epileptic seizures.	1.0037637331847304
In contrast, incontinence and head injury are common in both conditions.	1.0168071783551142
Investigations such as electroencephalogram, tilt testing and postictal prolactin or creatine kinase levels may aid diagnosis but are never diagnostic in isolation.	0.7998781953491904
In rare cases, hypoxic and epileptic mechanisms may interact within one attack.	0.863910867300218
In the past two decades increasing research efforts have focused on the molecular biology of the cell.	1.0945840801411073
In the beginning, these research activities were purely academic without any direct clinical relation.	0.8436905187048117
A series of important discoveries, initiated particularly by the unravelling of the genetic code and the discovery of the molecular basis of gene expression and genetics, the subsequent identification of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes and finally the description of major mechanisms which induce genetic instability in cells, now indicate the way to many new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.	1.030141553396818
In surgical oncology, these attempts are yielding the first clinical consequences.	1.0670480704300682
Basic aspects of molecular cell biology as far as they are relevant for surgical oncologists are discussed.	0.8709478837892657
The compartment syndrome (cs) is characterized by an increased tissue pressure in a limited space.	1.0850891759441192
Pathophysiologically, it is a multifactorial disease that is potentially induced by an initial trauma and develops according to the existence of cofactors.	1.157233609365689
Cofactors are, for instance, the circulation of the patient and the initial treatment of the impending cs.	1.4040410121046645
In particular, the microcirculation is altered with endothelial destruction, development of a capillary leak, protein loss from intravasal space and the development of an interstitial and intracellular third space.	1.0894214064766168
An impaired drainage of the lymphatic and venous system causes a venous infarction.	0.9323386096888024
An arterial infarction results if the tissue pressure exceeds the arteriolar pressure.	0.7879465105723646
An accompanying ischemia reperfusion mechanism increases the trauma load.	0.7102704842852838
In disadvantageous cases, the patients are in danger of developing a multi-organ deficiency syndrome (MODS) by an uncontrolled inflammatory reaction, by intravasal volume loss and by a myonephropathic systemic reaction.	1.189394190471141
Clinically, the patients suffer a disproportionate amount of pain, followed by neurological signs.	1.0820545173158966
Especially in noncompliant patients, tissue pressure measurement is useful.	0.917719700886302
Resuscitation of the circulation as well as splitting of casts is important.	0.9004602072834662
In case of a manifest cs, dermatofasciotomy has to be performed as an emergency operation.	1.2595456814460846
Even if cs is diagnosed early and fasciotomy is carried out early, the development of sequellae cannot be avoided in every single case.	0.9014766339407708
The object of this study was to evaluate retrospectively the value of open and arthroscopic procedures at mid-term and long-term follow-up.	0.9331576513597238
During the period from January 1980 to June 1997 we performed 247 open (technique: 134 according to Eden-Hybbinette-Lange, 46 according to Weber, 26 according to Putti-Platt, 41 according to Bankart) and 76 arthroscopic (transglenoidal Morgan technique) shoulder stabilization procedures.	1.0105545729299104
The mean follow-up for techniques was: Eden-Hybbinette-Lange 11.1 years (2.9-16.7 years), Weber 5.2 years (2.1-13.0 years), Putti-Platt 7.2 years (2.2-10.6 years), Bankart 1.6 years (0.5-3.2 years), and Morgan 3.5 years (2.8-5.1 years).	1.4721040162510373
We observed that the classic open Bankart procedure has superior results according to the criteria redislocation, range of motion, sports activity, and arthrosis in comparison with the other open procedures.	1.0594476103358987
The results shows that nonanatomical, reconstructive, open procedures are not up to date.	1.0118672576090035
The open Bankart procedure reconstructs the pathology of the anterior glenoid rim only.	0.9764592907303795
The classic open Bankart procedure seems to be the "gold standard" in open shoulder surgery today.	0.8696543734966747
The high redislocation rate of the arthroscopic procedure warrants a more stringent patient selection in the future.	0.9058628073575181
Background: Our study compared the haemodynamic changes after spinal anaesthesia with 2% lignocaine and 0,5% plain bupivacaine.	1.327850630627585
Hyperkalemia is a frequent disturbance.	0.862303130839677
When hyperkalemia is associated with a rapid rise of the serum potassium concentration, the risk of cardiac impairment is greatest.	1.0569415155317354
Usually the cooperative action of several causative factors is required to bring about a hyperkalemia.	0.9067977232393769
Increasing age, diabetes mellitus, disorders of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system, high-dose antibiotics, and immunsuppressive treatments may result in hyperkalemia.	0.9975401854213343
The most important pathogenetic mechanisms are (1) renal insufficiency, (2) hyporeninemic hypoaldeosteronism, (3) tubular disorders, and (4) cellular disorders.	1.0936289384584204
Background: CMV retinitis is the most common opportunistic ocular infection and the main cause of blindness in AIDS patients with a T-helper cell count <= 50/µl.	1.2963778181552736
Cidofovir is a nucleotide analogue with a long half-life time after phosphorylation intracellularly.	0.770635625532306
It is effective against CMV and can be given intravenously and intravitreally.	0.8769176870224968
The aim was to offer an alternative therapy for CMV retinitis to patients who could not receive standard treatment because of contraindications or refused it.	1.0066673302131492
The efficacy and tolerance of intravitreal injections of cidofovir should be evaluated.	0.7896568215382977
A case of multiple eccrine spiradenomata is reported.	0.916193879258026
One of the tumours was histopathologically associated with dermal cylindroma, and immunohistochemical studies showed that the cylindroma cells differentiate towards the secreting portion of the eccrine sweat gland.	1.0101863032626466
The relationship among multiple eccrine spiradenomata, dermal cylindroma and multiple trichoepitheliomata is discussed.	0.781228906030107
In view of the risks of a varicella infection during pregnancy and the more and more observed severe course of infection, varicella infection has to be considered as a serious disease.	1.0461790922583822
The initial antibiotic treatment of bacterial meningoencephalitis has major implications for the course of the disease.	0.7215485407037203
The current spectrum of infectious agents must be considered.	0.729322604847949
Antibiotics have to reach sufficient concentrations in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid for a bactericidal action to occur at the site of infection.	0.9714354279333725
Frequent problems arising in this condition are: (1) the non-observation of listerial infections, (2) the use of antibiotics not sufficiently active against gram-positive bacteria in pneumococal meningitis, (3) the development of meningitis following the use of ciprofloxacin in respiratory tract infections, (4) the hasty change in antibiotic regimens in focal parenchymal infections during delayed response to therapy, (5) the use of bacteriostatic antibiotics, and (6) the delay in administering sufficient antibiotic therapy during fulminate meningococcal meningitis.	1.1301279613984256
Problems arising from these conditions are illustrated by case reports.	0.7442880345527544
Therapy of rheumatoid arthritis with a combination of several disease-modifying drugs aims towards better control of the disease than achievable by monotherapy.	0.9925161619300379
Based on a broad variety of clinical studies, revealing more or less positive results, several combinations have been suggested:...	1.1032392675203366
The management of 178 patients with liver trauma (132 male, 46 female; mean age 34 years (range 3-88) presenting from January 1979 to August 1996 is reviewed.	1.0879991004564835
There were 165 cases of blunt trauma and 13 cases of penetrating injury.	0.8541243567058041
110 cases were classified as simple injuries (grade I or II) and 68 cases as complex injuries (grade III to V).	1.045141093134746
The overall mortality was 32 % (57 patients).	1.2352613509575192
The mortality for true hepatic injury was 15.7 %.	0.8089600272321045
None of the patients with penetrating injuries died.	1.220006529241605
Mortality was inflenced by the type of liver injury and the number of associated injuries.	0.8444186313797432
The postoperative complication rate was 55 %.	0.8763777720054527
The most-frequent postoperative complications related to the hepatic injury were intrahepatic or subcapsular hematoma (12.9 %) and postoperative bleeding (9.6 %).	1.0794311033146131
Intraabdominal abscess formation was seen in 2.8 %.	0.8373371984736454
Operative therapy for liver injuries depends on the grade of the injury.	0.8476841426837247
The majority of liver injuries can be managed by simple techniques, including electrocautery and application of hemostatic agents.	1.0934693951122592
In complex injuries hepatotomy, direct vessel ligation, and debridement of necrotic tissue is the method of choice (Pachter's procedure).	1.0007855334932154
In non-controlled bleeding, perihepatic picking is a standard method.	0.7909594674209968
Aim: The aim of the present study was to investigate knowledge, practices, and opinions on tobacco and oral health among dentists of the Berlin Dental Association using a questionnaire.	1.065780033424872
Materials and methods: Questions focussed on smoking habits, knowledge about oral malignancies and premalignancies and practical approaches to screening for oral mucosal diseases and other associations of tobacco with oral changes.	0.9610381171159548
The questions related to risk factors and behavioural counselling for patients and associated constraints.	1.0157556488504609
Results: Of a total of 4000 questionnaires sent, 483 were received for evaluation (12.1%).	1.0535880196815568
Of respondents 9.5% were regular smokers.	1.201033884595197
The median number of oral malignancies observed was 3.	0.7692763555393951
Knowledge about some associations of oral changes such as wound healing was adequate.	0.7351519460208011
A total of 93.1% of respondents would refer patients with oral lesions.	1.1516649958946996
Only 35% take a regular history of both tobacco and alcohol consumption and 26.6% explain the side effects of tobacco.	0.9850734328492555
Some 73.4% believed that the dentist could play a role in anti-tobacco counselling.	0.8072566723270628
Limiting factors were lack of training and of competence in anti-tobacco counselling.	0.7653783830120305
Conclusions: This study shows that there still is a considerable need for improvement of knowledge and for provision with effective anti-tobacco teaching material.	1.1353560790587525
Since most of the respondents thought that the dentist should play a role in anti-tobacco counselling, adequate programmes in Germany should be inititated and followed up.	0.985034084302775
Background: Last year's pilot study, which examined for the first time a representative group of patients with Chagas disease, showed that in this parasitosis changes in the ocular fundus can be expected in the form of defects of the retinal pigment epithelium.	1.3040452434998997
Examination of more patients in this study should give further information about the character and extent of the alterations found.	1.115407450054727
The posterior luxation of the shoulder joint is a rarely reported and often not recognized lesion in the clinical workday.	1.1032556721453204
The authors present the first case of a posterior luxation of the shoulder joint in combination with an contralateral anterior shoulder joint fracture dislocation.	1.0667280982773748
In that case the authors stress the importance of an exact clinical and radiology diagnostic and the right way to reduce a posterior luxation of the shoulder joint.	0.9785284522430534
Finally they draw the readers attention to operative steps to prevent a reluxation of the shoulder joint.	0.8517057987250254
Magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) has become the most important method in the workup of infantile cerebral complications after primary sonography.	1.0856833453792663
Cerebral MR examination and image interpretation during the infantile period require extensive knowledge of morphological manifestations, their pathophysiological background, and frequency.	1.0196599607487886
The choice of imaging parameters and image interpretation is demonstrated in infarctions and hemorrhages of the mature and immature brain.	0.9283649291902204
A review of the main differential diagnoses is also given.	1.0586732277737445
The relevance of MR spectroscopy and fetal MRI is discussed.	0.775323719650731
Currently laparoscopic surgery is limited by several factors.	0.972088808470625
One of them is the precise handling of optics.	0.8966450463626806
Up to now, in our hospital 52 laparoscopic operations have been done with a voice - controlled robot arm to handle the optics in gallbladder, stomach, large bowel and hernia operations.	1.1308179518480388
The visual field is determined by the surgeon.	0.8886522860819323
In all cases handling of the robot arm was precise and the voice response exact and without technical problems.	0.9208563927657532
Twenty-nine operations were done by one operator as "solo surgeries".	0.8952739405112211
In 20 further cases there was one assistant.	0.8947965366681999
A robot arm can be used successfully without problems by any laparoscopic surgeon in any operating theater.	0.9662935650018076
Urine specimens were collected from 49 persons up to 10 days after abstaining from cannabis use.	0.992615444584997
Urine samples (n = 135) were investigated for free and conjugated 9-carboxy-11-nor tetrahydrocannabinol (THCCOOH) by LC/MS/MS and for free and glucuronidated tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and 11-hydroxy-THC (11-OH-THC) by GC/MS prior to and after enzyme hydrolysis.	1.1830927633126762
Concentrations for free and conjugated THCCOOH were measured with reference to 100 mg creatinine/dL urine.	0.9592436982940524
Cannabis use was classified as light, moderate and heavy according to the current literature.	0.8796601972077466
In all groups chosen free and bound THCCOOH was present in urine samples on the day of the last use and on the next day.	1.0572356248714811
Urine samples from occasional and frequent users generally differed in the amount of THCCOOH and THCCOOH glucuronide.	0.7591092176957797
Within 4-6 days the concentrations of free and glucuronidated THCCOOH in urine samples of heavy users decreased to those ranges present in urine samples of moderate and light users.	0.9934151861752595
In frequent users, THC glucuronide and 11-OH-THC glucuronide could be found up to 1 and 3 days after abstinence, respectively.	0.9652314056597145
In light users, neither THC glucuronide nor 11-OH-THC glucuronide was detectable.	0.8154893417913431
The determination of conjugated THC and 11-OH-THC in addition to free and bound THCCOOH is suggested as an aid in assessing the frequency of cannabis use, but is limited to samples obtained within a few days after the last consumption.	1.0826213497489718
The participation of social work in inpatient psychiatric care is generally considered necessary, but there is a lack of empirical studies in this field.	1.0684843866145846
The analyses presented of a systematic documentation of social work interventions in 2038 cases during an 11-year period demonstrate that social workers are mostly involved in the treatment of chronic and previously treated patients.	1.105406075020723
Interventions in younger patients, most of whom are suffering from psychoses, aim at rehabilitation through activity; in elderly patients with organic or depressive disorders, the major concern is to improve posthospital care; patients with neurotic or personality disorders comprise another group with a chronic course and a relatively poor outcome.	1.1482716819934873
As far as their goals are comparable, social workers and doctors agree on their objectives.	0.9753326409315437
Social workers usually see their own interventions as successful, but patient groups who benefit greatly can be differentiated from groups with poor outcome.	0.9799803766888074
Stiff-man syndrome is a rare disorder of the central nervous system characterized by muscular rigidity and superimposed spasms.	0.9843063846586484
The etiology is still unknown and an autoimmune cause is discussed.	0.9713773988396852
Many differential diagnoses of muscular rigidity and of induration of the skin have to be considered.	0.9979258913213468
A 22 year old patient was admitted under suspicion of a stiff-man syndrome.	0.9571718874797898
He has had developed a painful rigidity of the trunk, starting in the neck.	0.9642382183777343
Massive stiffness of the trunk with pale appearance of the skin and a beginning disorder of swallowing and respiration were observed.	1.0795340233430901
Clinical investigation, EMG, cerebrospinal fluid and laboratory findings were all normal, thus excluding a stiff-man syndrome and other neuromuscular diseases.	0.9678081324543911
Skin biopsy showed typical changes of Buschke's scleredema adultorum, a rare connective tissue disorder of unknown etiology.	1.014939310176617
Therapy with corticosteroide and ciclosporin led to a mild improvement of symptoms.	0.6913441399201136
Although rare, Buschke's scleredema adultorum should be regarded as a differential diagnosis of the stiff man syndrome.	0.9831291621707221
Urogenital infections are established as hazards to male fertility.	0.725972711049662
Various pathophysiological hypotheses have evolved from experimental and clinical studies, facilitating explanation of the effects of bacteria and immunological events on reproductive tissues.	0.9473696014958353
Numerous current studies have identified and evaluated infectious mediators accounting for specific molecular events in urogenital infections.	0.8832076625413027
Valuable studies can be expected to appear in the future due to improvements in diagnostic procedures and new classifications of urogenital infections.	1.0796465532540915
X-ray or CT images allow only a limited three-dimensional orientation in presurgical planning.	1.0157688143361165
Especially for the planning of internal hemipelvectomies with custom-made endoprosthesis and for periacetabular osteotomies a high-grade orientation is necessary.	0.9719442244976523
This orientation is improved by a 3D CT-controlled manufactured 1:1 model of the pelvis.	1.0518003517157544
This enables an exact classification of defect and deformity, planning of resection planes, design of the suitable custom-made implant and simulation of the operation technique as preoperative quality control.	0.9918799342062107
An Ivalon-plug (PDA-plug) has been developed for transvenous closure of patent ductus arteriosus.	0.9914047818966026
It can be introduced into the ductus through standard venous sheaths with a diameter von 8-16 French.	0.9806693332417152
The plug is fixed in its target position by means of four distal (aortal) and two proximal (pulmonary) nitinol struts.	1.0226710658945084
In case of malpositioning the system can be pulled back into and retrieved through the sheath.	0.7515960286167114
In animal experiments endothelialization of the implanted material was demonstrated.	0.8078946798109226
PDA-closure was attempted in 58 patients; the procedure was successful in 57 cases; a residual ductal flow was present in eight patients.	1.0100388802378943
During a follow-up of up to 24 months there were no complications.	1.1097830669351074
Using 8 different monoclonal antibodies, immunohistology was performed on 36 follicular adenomas and on 28 follicular, 34 papillary, 27 medullary and 29 anaplastic carcinomas of the thyroid.	1.0547724655519033
The panel of antibodies was directed against broad-spectrum cytokeratins (pan-CK, antibody lu-5), against basic and acid high-molecular-weight CK of types  1, 5, 10 and 14, against basic ( 5 and 6) and acid high-molecular-weight CK ( 13) and against basic ( 7 and  8) and acid low-molecular-weight CK ( 19 and  20).	1.2190673867553412
With the exception of a large number of anaplastic carcinomas, nearly all other tumours exhibited strong immunoreactivity with antibodies against pan-CK, CK 8 and CK 19.	0.8976947613024705
CK 20 expression was exclusively shown for 2 medullary carcinomas.	0.7704220851413294
Reactivity for high-molecular-weight CK could only, each time focally, be demonstrated for 14 papillary and 2 follicular carcinomas and for 2 anaplastic carcinomas with partial squamous differentiation.	1.030061402903963
Thirteen anaplastic carcinomas were not decorated by any of the CK antibodies applied.	0.784214280280124
CK 7 staining exceeding the staining of individual cells was observed in 26 papillary cancers.	0.8907627616283421
In contrast, such a finding could only be obtained with each one follicular adenoma, medullary carcinoma and anaplastic carcinoma and with 5 follicular carcinomas.	1.1763321954008972
These results confirm earlier studies in that CK 20 expression among thyroid tumours is restricted to the neuroendocrine medullary carcinomas and that in a larger percentage of anaplastic thyroid carcinomas an epithelial phenotype can not be demonstrated even upon using broad-spectrum CK antibodies.	1.0202658638032087
New is the finding that there exist considerable differences between papillary carcinomas and all other non-papillary thyroid tumours regarding CK 7 expression.	0.9279587318890559
This result might be of differential diagnostic value for the distinction of follicular and papillary thyroid neoplasias which sometimes have an overlapping histological pattern.	0.9120805751875016
Purpose: To compare reading speed and reading comfort between closed-circuit television systems (CCTVs) with different image refresh rates.	1.0726961694170531
This surveillance study presents a literature review concerning the very inhomogeneous care emphasis of the acute psychosocial crisis both with respect to crisis insight and therapy methods and to professional responsibility.	0.9572806465144462
In detail general care models of psychotherapeutic crisis intervention are described, as well as disorder- and event-specific concepts and papers on crisis intervention with children, teen-agers, and adolescents of the last 10 years.	0.9971346943765979
In addition, the contributions of the empirical psychotherapy research and their results are presented as far as they are relevant to crisis intervention.	1.0858404320594213
In recent years many different systems for transcatheter closure of an atrial septal defect (ASD) have been developed and tested.	1.0511293209062054
However, all systems presently available have some special disadvantages.	1.2812118236409316
The recently introduced Amplatzer Septal Occluder (ASO), though, appears promising.	1.086485207099244
It is a self-expanding and self-centering double disc made from a Nitinol mesh, which is tightly woven to give mechanical strength.	1.0098142827537269
Both discs are separated by a connecting cylindrical portion.	0.7073965231592625
Its diameter may be chosen, so that it corresponds to that of the ASD.	0.9765447857318643
In the light of recent research findings the inappropriateness of many commonly accepted concepts in psychosomatic medicine is discussed.	0.8453427503018116
They do not stand up to empirical scrutiny.	0.7306099671587567
This applies both to sepcifity models and to duality of body and mind or of illness and health.	0.8047609565861403
The monocausal-psychogenetic view was replaced through a complex interplay of hierarchie somato-psychic circles which are to be integrated into a biosemiotic model.	0.8126141674032573
In terms of the self-object-body system a greater significance is attached to affects in the communication and acting receives an important interactive function.	0.8779655961304696
The effects of the altered theroretical positions on new therapy approaches are discussed.	0.8321479966187064
Perioperative, mostly silent ischaemia in patients with coronary heart disease is difficult to detect by clinical examinations.	1.1471770861140107
Herpes simplex viruses are known to be among the most common disease-causing microorganisms.	1.0130550148998931
Their prevalence can exceed 90% depending on the socioeconomic status of the population.	0.8009024431885595
Since the number of immunocompromised patients has increased because of the increased incidence in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and an increase in organ transplantation, herpes virus infection may have a greater clinical significance.	1.0112048692098616
While treatment of otherwise healthy individuals will not usually cause any clinical problems herpes infection in an immunocompromised patient can have severe consequences.	0.9342557678662406
Additionally, development of viral resistance can be observed that may require alternative drugs in treatment.	1.2052801476689656
We present a case history of a man with a B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia that was associated with a very unusual herpes simplex virus infection in the nasal vestibule.	1.2244423091752685
Possible causes for the development of resistance in herpes infections and the use of famciclovir and forscarnet as two therapeutic alternatives to aciclovir are discussed.	0.8283554155322369
Tumor invasion of the portal vein by ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head is classically known as a criterion for inoperability.	0.835352473627698
Despite improvement in operation techniques for portal vein resection during Whipple's procedure and acceptable mortality and morbidity, in the case of uncertain tumor infiltration vascular resection cannot be recommended in general.	1.0512628890806521
The problem is the preoperative detection of tumor infiltration of the portal vein.	0.9799017645950027
Often the surgeon is confronted with unsuspected macroscopic portal vein infiltration or tumor adhesion during the operation.	0.8104919275926922
Between 1986 and 1995 105 patients underwent Whipple's procedure for ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head in our department.	0.8669432997476209
In eight of these cases partial portal vein resection was performed because of macroscopic tumor infiltration or tumor adhesion.	0.9515450365595317
In all eight cases the preoperative diagnostic procedures with CT and portography did not show any suspicion of tumor infiltration.	1.0361838458010166
In four of the eight cases histological tumor infiltration of all vascular layers was found.	0.9656348940747022
In the others we found no or only adventitial tumor invasion.	0.9456913439480475
The patients without tumor infiltration of the portal vein showed a survival time after surgery of 27.78 months in contrast to 6.67 months in the group with histologically proven tumor infiltration.	1.1697012313415966
Endovascular, intraportal ultrasound (IPEUS), a new diagnostic procedure, can give helpful information regarding portal vein involvement.	1.1452760461631852
Although the IPEUS is not a standard diagnostic procedure it was shown to detect portal vein infiltration with high sensitivity and specificity.	1.0402833083819112
Our results indicate that in such cases where portal vein infiltration has been excluded by IPEUS, patients with macroscopic tumor adhesion do benefit from partial portal vein resection.	0.9951039477832246
Progression in medical research and economic needs require new planning and organization of treatment strategies.	0.8618958142914369
This does also apply for stroke treatment: New pathophysiological knowledge, positive results of thrombolytic therapy and the demostrated importance of early treatment at Stroke Units justify that stroke must be regarded as an emergency.	1.05617960568398
Timing is of utmost importance.	0.5337855106690356
Time-based management serves as a planning model for a new stroke treatment strategy.	0.9166524315754244
The treatment process is divided into three phases: alarming, pre-hospital and in-hospital phase.	0.9940910818959544
The effectiveness of each of these phases is influenced by several variables (personnel, technical equipment, course of the disease, etc.).	0.8837220104825471
Knowledge of each separate phase helps to discover weaknesses, which allows an aimed improvement, e.g.	0.8818695865339198
public education, training of paramedics and medical personnel.	0.8730820953250364
Modern communication systems allow new information transfer, which can help to avoid unnecessary transport of patients.	1.1790644059078952
Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) is a severe complication after heart valve replacement.	1.1011464254081391
Incidence ranges in literature between 0.1% and 2.3% (mean 0.4%) per patient year (pty).	1.3405529369943816
PVE is classified as "early" or "late" (occurence within or after 60 days following heart valve replacement).	1.0765396686848496
In this review we present the clinical outcome of PVE as well as the most common diagnostic criteria (Duke criteria), the potential etiologies and the most frequent bacteria.	1.553246899274771
The spectrum of therapeutical alternatives is discussed and a special attention is directed to the development of prevention standards.	0.9482214565167368
Recently intra-atrial defibrillation has become an interesting alternative to external defibrillation and drug therapy for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.	1.0510274519171907
Low-energy intra-atrial defibrillation can be used to restore sinus rhtyhm f.ex.	1.0490073945278293
after a failed external cardioversion or during an electrophysiologic study when the administration of antiarrhythmic drugs should be avoided.	0.8543598150731239
Additionally this new technique has led to the development of implantable atrial defibrillators for the treatment of selected patients suffering from chronic atrial fibrillation.	0.9890886228102822
Intra-atrial defibrillation seems to be a highly effective and safe method, but little experience exists concerning the outcome so far.	1.138036441970305
Especially the potential risk of inducing ventricular proarrhythmia is subject of current controversy.	0.8034131006300116
Modern imaging techniques are a substantial part of treatment planning for minimally invasive radiotherapeutic procedures.	0.985552232632855
The aim is three-dimensional assessment of the target volume and adjacent critical structures.	1.0295787720287126
In this paper, we report on our clinical experience with a precise system for stereotactic image correlation.	1.213037845621371
Hereby, the advantages of each imaging modality can be combined.	0.9978720164126366
Precise immobilization of the patient is a prerequisite.	1.4915737620876597
The immobilization method has an accuracy of less than 1 mm.	0.824769245192215
This method was evaluated in a clinical study in which a tumor control rate of 93 % was achieved in patients with brain metastases after stereotactic single high dose radiotherapy.	1.3221645226475447
This indicated the excellent reliability of this treatment planning method.	0.9505801260983752
The integration of functional image information, such as blood flow or activation of cerebral cortical areas, will be evaluated in the future.	0.9228053753592792
Olfactory dysfunction seems to be one of the most frequent symptoms in idiopathic parkinsonian syndrome (IPS).	0.9339227232966044
In contrast to the increasing number of studies providing evidence of the usefulness of olfactory tests in the diagnosis of IPS, clinical assessment of olfactory function is rarely performed.	1.2011637472638963
This may be due to the lack of an easy-to-use,  inexpensive, standardized, and reliable test.	1.1328676014875783
In this study, we administered the newly developed "sniffin' sticks" test to a group of 40 nondemented IPS patients and compared the results with 40 healthy controls matched for age, gender, and smoking habits.	1.096091122167519
In all three subtests including odor identification, odor detection threshold, and odor discrimination, the control group scored significantly better than the IPS group, yielding a specificity and sensitivity of 90% each.	1.1019576813062886
Our results indicate that olfactory disturbances in IPS can be found at early stages of the disease, appear bilaterally, and do not correlate with the dominant side of parkinsonism.	0.9850840409496321
Therefore, we emphasize that olfactory testing may be a useful tool in the diagnosis of IPS.	1.333765855054971
Purpose: The goal of this exemplary study was to integrate morphological and functional MRI to establish computer-based, preoperative therapy planning for tumors, instancing cervical carcinoma.	1.1687402807274616
Drug-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare but frequently lethal disease of the skin and mucosa of unknown etiology.	1.1735119086456527
Toxic metabolic and immunologic products in the serum have been discussed as possible causes.	0.922705618809799
For this reason we have performed plasmapheresis on these patients for many years.	1.0969853201681274
Results regarding survival and healing of the lesions are quite favorable, as exemplified with two patients described here who benefited from the procedure despite their old age.	1.1243229082839301
In order to gain insight into possible disease mechanisms that would explain the beneficial effect of plasmapheresis, we did immunohistochemical studies on these patients before and in one case after the procedure.	1.1878456586659014
In dermis and epidermis, there was a striking increase of macrophages and a relative increase of CD8-positive lymphocytes which might act as cytotoxic effector cells; these findings can be interpreted as the result of an immunological reaction.	1.0794052691419922
An increased staining of lesional epidermis with TNF, as previously noted by other autors, should be interpreted with caution since necrotic cells are involved.	0.9773743861909644
On the basis of the clinical results, the pathogenetic considerations, and in view of the lack of specific treatment modalities, clinical studies concerning plasmapheresis for the treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis are recommended, particularly since this procedure is widely available and generally well tolerated.	1.302320497317831
The majority of inflammatory frontal sinus diseases requiring operative intervention can now be managed successfully by endonasal surgery.	1.000989367126246
In problematic cases, however, optimal exposure of the entire frontal sinus and possibly complete mucous membrane removal combined with sinus obliteration must be achieved.	1.0866729913600521
In these cases, external frontal sinus surgery is indicated.	0.9909710030064027
Impaction of an intramedullary nail during extraction is an unpredictable and delicate situation.	0.8132797895890199
Its problematic nature is unfolded on a report of two cases, one with a Küntscher nail and one with a modern solid titanium nail.	0.9979286876724229
This event is caused by ingrowth of new bone formation into the slot or the dorsal flute respectively.	0.8587011352807439
The new bone formation is a mechanical barrier which effectively forces the distal part of the nail to jam against the cortex.	0.9038191343842581
Both, the slot of the unlocked reamed clover leaf nail and the wider dorsal flute of the solid titanium nail, realize certain therapeutic concepts.	0.8648623532132178
Their factual benefit within the concept of interlocking nailing is doubtful.	0.6632650278600495
Primary intracranial germ cell tumors are rare neurological diseases.	0.8230948884929384
Secreting germ cell tumors that predominantly appear in the pineal region are characterized by elevated levels of -HCG and AFP in CSF.	0.8453059094210609
Adequate diagnostic and therapeutic regimens of these tumors are still under debate.	0.9956705894276523
We present the case of a patient suffering from spinal metastasis of a secreting germ cell tumor with raised levels of -HCG in CSF.	1.0046791149329637
Six years before, a pineocytoma of intermediate differentiation had been diagnosed by stereotaxic biopsy.	1.0017251422466502
This demonstrates the importance of an early detection of a germ cell neoplasm in case of midline-sized brain-tumors by evaluation of -HCG and AFP in CSF and serum.	1.0633839905314513
Today, different therapeutic strategies depending on the histological diagnosis are available and justify a high priority of a surgical tumor biopsy.	1.1955784386815556
However, the value of stereotaxic procedures remains controversial.	0.8760393300362593
Recently published data gave evidence of a definite improved prognosis of secreting CNS germ cell tumors following combined treatment with high-dose polychemotherapy, surgical resection and radiation of the tumor area.	1.2236462868574363
-HCG and AFP may serve as useful markers to enable follow-up of the disease.	0.9890266531368176
In order to get a better data management of complications in orthopedic surgery and in order to get comparable statistics a standardisation of nomenclature and classification of complications is demanded since 1.1.1997.	1.088230009666542
The Orthopedic University Clinic of Heidelberg started with a register of all early complications of all inpatients.	0.8424073466987934
According to a standardized nomenclature all occured complications the doctors put in the data of complications in a database.	1.0766742196709087
These data were controlled, complemented and classified by members of the quality menagement group.	1.0497946754259737
This guideline consists of five parts: catalogue of diagnoses, general and special definitions, classification and an allocation table of diagnoses to grades of severity.	0.9360353183813578
The internet plays an important role in a growing number of medical applications.	0.9328680150754992
Finding relevant information is not always easy as the amount of available information on the Web is rising quickly.	1.0462052972216753
Even the best Search Engines can only collect links to a fraction of all existing Web pages.	0.8041102985464819
In addition, many of these indexed documents have been changed or deleted.	1.1620003247922026
The vast majority of information on the Web is not searchable with conventional methods.	0.8466208915113298
New search strategies, technologies and standards are combined in Intelligent Search Agents (ISA) and Robots, which can retrieve desired information in a specific approach.	1.0772583629935701
With the availability of modern imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), diagnostic options in the evaluation of Marfan patients have been improved profoundly.	1.0711394956286338
The most recent diagnostic advances comprise noninvasive tissue characterization of the aortic wall, immunofluorescence studies or pulse chase analyses of skin and cultured dermal fibroblasts, and molecular analysis at the cDNA/DNA level of the fibrillin-1 gene.	1.0647821623360003
New diagnostic insights have eventually led to revised nosologic criteria for the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome.	0.7963185757492456
The diagnostic reliability as well as the advantage and limitation of these recent diagnostic strategies are discussed: moreover diagnostic concepts for patients with neonatal as well as classic Marfan syndrome are presented and discussed in the context of the clinical management during adolescence, gravidity as well as in the pre- and postoperative patient.	1.2037932332042967
Primary defects of skeletal growth and development can be subdivided into hypoplasias, dysostoses and dysplasias.	0.8044663793312057
Hypoplastic bones are small but otherwise normal.	0.6466823877416399
Generalized skeletal hypoplasias comprise various forms of primordial dwarfism and syndromal disorders including trisomy 21 and Ullrich-Turner syndrome.	0.6985580094678854
Dysostoses are defects of bones as organs resulting from errors of morphogenesis.	0.7387811238442991
Many of them are caused by mutations of single genes in the cascade of morphogenetic gene sequences.	0.9254772393379523
Dysplasias are defects of bone as tissue.	0.6646144000567036
Some of them (e. g. achondroplasia, Jansen type of metaphyseal chondrodysplasia) are caused by defects of signal genes influencing cell division or differentiation.	0.9170696604914419
Others result from gene mutations affecting the cellular production of matrix components.	0.7225473732105425
Examples are collagenopathies such as osteogenesis imperfecta and some spondyloepiphyseal dysplasias.	0.6634861507521165
Finally, disorders such as pycnodysostosis, result from defects of chondro-osseous homeostasis.	1.0188759809557302
The study of skeletal defects helps to unravel the complexity of normal skeletal development.	0.8674247705445427
Human parvovirus B19 causes erythema infectiosum (fifth disease) and aplastic crisis.	0.8824396350300129
In pregnancy, B19 may be transmitted on to the fetus resulting in hydrops fetalis.	0.784118740531977
B19 is sometimes associated with thrombocytopenia and vasculitis.	0.6825043339679727
In immunocompromised patients, B19 may persist causing chronic infection.	0.6463751885594468
Several methods for detecting B19 virus or specific antibodies are now available.	0.7860048748310717
B19 infection does not usually require therapy.	0.5423590794095855
Efficacy of immunoglobulins in chronic B19 infection has been demonstrated.	0.8556349221340405
In absence of significant symptoms and signs, the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) remains difficult.	1.108936711960473
Sensitivity and specifity of laboratory tests, chest X-ray, and ECG on their own is low.	1.073783625591915
Echocardiography is particularly useful in critically ill patients suspected of having pulmonary emboli and can help identify right ventricular pressure overload.	0.9561987013150037
Venous ultrasonography is useful in patients with suspected PE, but normal results do not rule out PE.	1.0400455951378587
Helical CT with contrast medium can identify pulmonary emboli.	0.6282732972474196
However, if the CT findings are normal in the presence of a high index of clinical suspicion, only larger pulmonary embolism are ruled out, and angiography with the focus on distal pulmonary vasculature should be performed.	1.2907570524367087
The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism should be made by combining clinical assessment, several diagnostic techniques, and finally pulmonary angiography in doubtful cases.	1.1606911794978951
Heparin remains the standard therapy for patients with stable hemodynamics.	1.0468388824375063
Thrombolytic therapy is recommended in hemodynamically compromised patients.	0.960557260784471
In short-term dose regimes, the thrombolytic agents urokinase, streptokinase, and rt-PA seem to be equally efficient.	1.0812684105657215
So far, however, no study has proven that thrombolytic therapy significantly reduces mortality in pulmonary embolism.	1.0642868856077268
Background: Data on mesopic vision after LASIK are not available to date.	1.1645403195821535
We therefore evaluated mesopic vision in myopic eyes before and after LASIK.	0.7463297473228457
Renal tubular dysgenesis is a rarely recognized condition characterized by oligohydramnios, Potter's sequence and congenital anuria leading to stillbirth or neonatal death from respiratory failure.	0.8326639252889549
It is thought to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.	0.8842131811044266
Definitive diagnosis is based on renal histology, revealing the lack of proximal tubule differentiation.	0.865775286057178
Two additional cases of affected sibs in a family with parental consanguinity are reported.	0.8779870290644198
Lectin and immunohistochemical studies confirmed structural and functional immaturity of the proximal tubule.	1.038176165827848
Further findings include bilateral renal vein thrombosis.	0.5848622260486396
The clinical and morphological parameters defining this disorder and the possible mechanisms of pathogenesis are discussed.	1.1285728572825722
Articular cartilage has only a small capacity for regneration.	0.8638897445663393
This makes the repair of articular surfaces difficult.	0.821786807284564
In 1959 Pridie described his method of resurfacing osteoarthritic knee joints.	0.6459681818944639
This operation is still in widespread use today.	0.9138508412531454
Pridie introduced the principle of drilling exposed subchondral bone with the objective of encouraging a fibro-cartilaginous repair.	0.8893005293245402
The newly formed fibrocartilaginous layer that develops over the lesion in osteoarthritis may be enough to decrease patients symptoms.	0.8892619310294194
Bone drilling into the subchondral layer is also effective in promoting healing of osteochondrosis dissecans.	0.8607454025531146
The choice of the treatment should be based on factors such as age of the patient, serverity of symptoms, activity level and functional demands on the joint, site and stage of the lesion.	1.0649331081359816
The drilling operation remains useful in osteoathritis and osteochondrosis dissecans.	0.6542667472309114
Recent immunobiological findings together with advances in biotechnology, ameliorations in clinical trial design, and MRI developments have led to a variety of therapeutical approaches in multiple sclerosis (MS).	0.8359705339196492
However, in contrast to successfully introduced new treatments, a number of therapeutical failures exist as well: despite impressive data from animal models, convincing concepts, and promising phase I/II studies, some investigated drugs and strategies showed no positive effects in clinical trials, or trials had to be terminated because of unexpected side effects.	1.1627923255563943
This article provides an overview of clinical studies that have failed or been abandoned for other reasons.	0.9368931806873976
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -antagonists which have led to negative effects in two studies (Lenercept, Infliximab) are discussed in detail.	1.2281033847313205
These results raise critical questions concerning the hypothetical pathogenesis of MS lesions and the value of MRI in the assessment of clinically relevant therapeutic drug effects.	0.8972357744501929
In addition to a description of the immunobiological background, studies on the immunosuppressive agents linomide, deoxyspergualin, sulfasalazine and cladribine, trials for the cytokines interleukin-10 and TGF-2, the studies on remyelination by intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg), oral tolerance, and extracorporeal photopheresis are discussed.	1.1025861375286246
Isolated pancreatic metastases from renal-cell carcinomas (RCC) are extremely rare.	0.8262751402656352
Only 96 cases of clinically diagnosed renal-cell carcinoma metastatic to the pancreas have been reported in the world literature, and 70 of the patients (including ours) underwent a definitive surgical resection.	1.268119983396673
In many cases the time between the nephrectomy and diagnosis of metachronous metastases is reported to exceed 10 years.	1.047516635467088
Therefore, the initial diagnosis may be overlooked when there is a prolonged disease-free interval.	1.290023370649597
When it does occur simultaneously or metachronously, aggressive surgical resection, when possible, seems to be the most effective treatment for this metastatic lesion.	1.1142140437079926
Surgical resection can provide long-term survival in selected cases.	0.9708629824216791
We present the case of a 69-year-old woman in whom two pancreatic metastases were treated by a left-sided subtotal pancreatectomy with splenectomy, 12 years after radical nephrectomy for a RCC.	1.0780874549706208
The patient simultaneously presented with both a mass in the body of the pancreas and a right-sided colon cancer.	1.0140412146313003
Thus, the diagnosis of pancreatic metastasis of colon cancer was suspected initially.	1.1900454365854758
Both tumors were radically resected, and histological examination revealed two pancreatic metastases from the previous RCC.	1.087332178169048
In the world literature this report represents the eighth case of multiple pancreatic metastases due to RCC.	0.9523305710557687
It illustrates a rare indication of pancreatic resection because of pancreatic metastasis.	0.8938070404716171
The need for prolonged follow-up of patients is emphasized.	1.266749165515704
The few reports on surgically treated pancreatic metastases from RCC are reviewed after the presentation of this case.	0.9619070713341372
Delusion is understood to mean intersubjectively disconcerting convictions with a tendency toward subjective certainty that lose their disconcerting character when made the object of psychiatric analysis in the knowledge of their independence from mental disorder.	0.9382717830219379
The perceptions from which delusions arise are dynamically charged according to their role in the structural context.	0.8779115613273557
The realisation pressure that burdens the perceptions and is intensified in psychotic constitutions is a precondition for the delusion.	0.7522417174424774
The failure of derealisation brought about by the psychotic disorganisation of the structure is also a requirement.	0.990157729354689
Based on a case study, considerations arising out of the initial stages of schizophrenic delusion are extended to other forms of delusion and to the conditions for chronification.	1.1575983331080764
High-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) is a promising treatment for patients with germ cell tumours and a poor prognosis.	1.1441108962984439
The selection of patients who may profit from this intervention is challenging for the urologist, as the indication has to be carefully established.	1.1955563440028751
Exclusion criteria primarily concern impaired organ functions.	0.581896914751372
Prior to HDCT haematopoietic stem cells are obtained after the administration of conventional-dose chemotherapy plus G- or GM-CSF stimulation.	0.9787726905939388
HDCT consists of a combination of carboplatin, etoposide and ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide.	0.7275506389053822
After HDCT, haematologic monitoring and maximal supportive care are essential.	0.7314929940877474
It is therefore recommended that HDCT only be administered at specialized centres.	0.8845161776576926
Pyoderma gangrenosum develops in most patients between the age of 25 and 54 years.	1.050304384028278
It usually occurs in otherwise healthy persons or in association with a systemic desease.	0.8382034692095436
Several clinical variants of pyoderma gangrenosum have been described.	0.6431728632495647
Extremely painful ulcerations are characteristic and evolve rapidly.	0.6780845418853273
Malignant pyoderma, the variant described in our case report, is an aggressive variant of ulcerative pyoderma gangrenosum, rapidly progressive and a potentially lethal ulcerative disease.	1.2184231708597097
The diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum depends on recognition of the evolving clinical features because histopathologic changes are not specific and characteristically serological or hematological markers of the disease do not exist.	1.0796310623698033
Histopathologic findings, however, always include vasculitis, either in form of the necrotizing cutaneous vasculitis (7), granulomatous (1) or lymphocytic vasculitis (2).	1.211753855958842
We report on a 36-year-old male patient, who underwent surgery for repair of an aneurysm of the aortic arch.	1.2337978722428422
The aneurysm occurred two months after exacerbation of a malignant variant of pyoderma gangrenosum with nearly lethal exit.	0.9642258130883761
An association of pyoderma gangrenosum with vasculitis has been described previously, but the present report is the first to describe an aortic arch aneurysm which seems to be associated with necrotizing angiitis of the vasa vasorum caused by a pyoderma gangrenosum.	1.17127576363261
We could demonstrate successful perioperative treatment for prevention of exacerbation of pyoderma gangrenosum with prednisone and clofazimine	0.8721424820876307
Background and purpose: To test the association of cardiac sources of embolism with territorial type brain infarcts.	0.8878373733035894
Defects of the dorsal and ventral ligament complexes of the lumbar spine results to an instability of the functional spinal unit.	0.9620262685092029
For the prognosis of secondary instability due to disko-ligamentous injuries the functional insufficiency of the lasting scars is a larger problem than the primar loss of osseous stability with fast healing tendency.	0.9120704917264413
The main goal of the present biomechanical study in vitro was to demonstrate the different grades of instability in the correlation to progressive disko-ligamentous defects as well as stabilisation through dynamic and static procedures.	1.0332548131438366
With a transpedicular screw-ringband-system the segmental function was preserved and instability was abolished.	0.8101113237078086
After rigid instrumentation with a fixateur intern remained a residual range of motion due to which can result refuse to bending moments without spondylodesis in an implant failure.	0.9367566247781198
CT- or MRI-guided stereotactic procedures should be a standard in a modern neurosurgical unit.	1.1089532318022284
Analysing 71 cases the indications and results of stereotactic neurosurgery are presented.	0.8858294297236202
In 53 patients stereotactic serial biopsies of different intraaxial lesions were performed, in 5 patients a spontaneous haemorrhage of the basal ganglia was removed by lysis with r-tPA.	1.0214998794866916
In 3 patients suffering from hydrocephalus due to diencephalic cysts a cystventricular shunt device was implanted.	0.7716460600543376
In 3 patients an intracerebral abscess was aspirated and drained.	0.8241553756554093
A stereotactic guided craniotomy and excision of small deep-seated lesions was performed in 6 cases.	0.9543002138012275
The accuracy of stereotactic tumour biopsies was 88.7 % in our series, in accordance to other authors.	1.2822177101177756
The stereotactic aspiration and drainage of an intracerebral abscess provides accurate localization and minimal cortical damage and offers the possibility of intracavitary application of antibiotics.	0.914991967806139
The stereotactic internal shunt implantation seems to be an alternative approach in the treatment of diencephalic cysts due to its minimal invasiveness and low operative risk.	1.073673702984611
The aspiration of basal ganglia haematomas with insertion of an external drainage allows the lysis of the haematoma with r-tPA or urokinase.	0.8560497576162578
With stereotactic guidance small, deep-seated intraaxial lesions can be well localized and removed.	0.7291876968848867
Radiotherapy of patients with prostate cancer offers an alternative to radical prostatectomy in early stages (T1-T2).	1.1214792403979712
In locally advanced prostate cancer a high dose or combined radiotherapy is more effective than radical surgery with concurrent lower morbidity and mortality.	0.9109162486798571
Recent developments in linear accellerator technique, the progress in dose calculation and planning techniques provide the means to apply higher doses to a given tumor volume while effectively protecting the surrounding normal tissue at the same time.	0.9986077212768419
These improvements may possibly reduce the rate of therapy related side effects or complications significantly.	0.8444878157542276
The combination of external beam radiotherapy and interstitial brachytherapy as well as the combination of hormone therapy and external beam radiotherapy are most likely more effective than percutaneous irradiation alone.	1.1115550030661472
In special cases with a very low risk of recurrent tumor an interstitial permanent brachytherapy alone is indicated.	1.1450269124809505
Future developments (i. e. intensity modulated radiotherapy - IMRT, combined thermo-radiotherapy, proton- or neutrontherapy) may further increase the rate of curative treatments in patients with prostate cancer.	1.1415979054967031
Skin is the second most common site of extranodal lymphoma.	0.8228117939913555
The significance of cutaneous B-cell lymphomas has been underestimated due to the lack of monoclonal antibodies and molecular genetics in former years.	0.926668058863299
Cutaneous B-cell lymphomas represent a heterogenous group of entities which show variation in histology, immunophenotype and in prognosis.	0.8104544977778017
The most common entities presenting in skin are follicular lymphomas, marginal zone B-cell lymphomas, and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.	1.0451959874801608
The majority of primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas have an excellent prognosis.	1.1314343425652063
Whereas in B-cell lymphomas with secondary spread to the skin the clinical course is dependant on the prognosis of the primary lymphoma.	1.2907135265127798
It is evident that primary cutaneous lymphomas are distinct from nodal lymphomas and not extranodal manifestations of their lymph-node-based counterparts.	0.9465085425430882
In the current review the morphologic spectrum of cutaneous B-cell lymphomas comprising primary and secondary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas is discussed according to the WHO classification sheme.	1.0880908790198698
The phencyclidine derivative ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist with the thalamo-neocortical projection system as the primary site of action.	0.8354140621470991
Racemic ketamine consists of the enantiomers S(+)-ketamine and R(-)-ketamine.	1.0241192701732937
Racemic ketamine has never been considered an adequate anaesthetic agent in neurosurgical patients since  it produces regionally specific stimulation of cerebral metabolism (CMRO2) and increases cerebral blood flow (CBF) and intracranial pressure (ICP).	0.871089232917736
However, recent experiments suggest that both tracemic ketamine and S(+)-ketamine may reduce infarct size in animal models of incomplete cerebral ischaemia and brain injury.	1.1221580825111617
This experimental protective effect appears to be related to decreases in Ca++ influx and maintenance of brain tissue magnesium levels due to NMDA and quisqualate receptor blockade by ketamine.	0.7667781194946346
Studies in dogs have shown that racemic ketamine (2.0 mg/kg) increases CBF in the presence of the cerebral vasodilator N2O.	0.9415521868882762
In contrast, studies in rats without background anaesthesia showed increases in CBF after racemic ketamine (100 mg/kg i.p.).	1.050470761926026
This suggests that the cerebrovascular effects of racemic ketamine are related to the pre-existing cerebrovascular tone induced by background anaesthetics.	0.5475619690380824
Cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity was maintained regardless of the baseline cerebrovascular resistance.	0.7707658660036004
There are several mechanisms by which racemic ketamine may increase CBF.	0.9306976699173773
It induces dose-dependent respiratory depression with consequent mild hypercapnia in spontaneously ventilating subjects.	0.775014072176951
This produces vasodilation due to the intact cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity.	0.8522374349305263
Racemic ketamine also induces regional neuroexcitation, which leads to stimulation of cerebral glucose consumption in the limbic, extrapyramidal, auditory, and sensory-motor systems.	1.1075631653798605
This regional neuroexcitation with increased CMRO2 produces increases in CBF that can be blocked by infusion of barbiturates or benzodiazepines.	0.8202280339156787
However, increases in CBF with racemic ketamine (1 mg/kg) may also occur during normocapnia and without changes in CMRO2.	1.3951137928024677
