For one thing, it can be assumed that a moderate amount of movement does not increase the risk of developing arthritis: for another, sporting activity during early and late childhood produces a high maximum bone mass, therby delaying the development of osteoporosis in later life.	0.5848267546844026
The new guidelines on the extent and intensity of health-giving exercise make it easier to advocate exercise and sport for disease prevention and health promotion because they appear to implement.	0.49266094865284704
More difficult, however, is deciding on a suitable method for motivating inactive individuals to increase their level of physical acitivity.	0.48196032056809585
A model that has proved effective in smoking cessation programmes, and one that can also be applied to exercise counselling (transtheoretical model), can help in the selection of an appropriate counselling strategy.	0.69944917481547
Depending on whether an individual is inactive, or sporadically or regularly active, each one employs his or her own strategies primarily to maintain this lifestyle.	0.49316452342015793
Assuming that the counselling is adapted to the level of activity, the patient's attitude and behaviour can be influenced both more effectively and more economically.	0.6960515443312414
Background: Photorefraktive keratectomy (PRK) is the most frequent refractive surgical procedure worldwide.	0.7092924205552075
The central corneal thickness is reduced due to removal of the anterior stroma, including Bowman's layer, with a laser beam.	0.7505524257647556
This procedure results in considerable alterations of the corneal structure.	0.41591934353462795
What does this mean for the mechanical properties of the cornea?	0.5130669128379249
Beginning in the 1920s Wilhelm Reich developed the fundamental concepts of a body-oriented psychotherapy out of psychoanalysis.	0.4095661226767054
He started from considerations of egopathology, sexuality and the analysis of resistance and character patterns.	0.420769174340701
Characterological and bodily attitudes were understood as defence-patterns against emotions, which function not only psychologically but also bodily.	0.4219709706671695
Thus he began to mobilize repressed affects through working on muscular tensions and bodily expressions.	0.25772942880519206
That way their meaning in the person's history could be understood and a self-healing process restarted.	0.46731867772688734
This approach to release constrained energy is still valid for neoreichian schools such as bioenergetics, biodynamics, biosynthesis and others whose understanding of human nature and of healing processes is similar to those of other schools of humanistic psychotherapy.	0.4565286222901049
Bodily processes are used as indicators for the processes and successes of therapies.	0.47827035259974565
Besides there are impulses in modern body psychotherapies to work with the body in the relationship and transference process and attempts to reintegrate psychoanalytical concepts.	0.49259683150063405
Recurrent phlebothromboses in young patients with subsequent severe postthrombotic syndrome and chronic venous leg ulcers may be caused by underlying hereditary disorders of hemostasis or may occur as part of other congenital syndromes.	0.47454974082029827
The most common hereditary disorders of hemostasis in this respect appear to be deficiencies of antithrombin III, protein C, and protein S, and activated protein C resistance (mutations of factor V).	0.6879299698155419
Less frequently, dysfibrinogenemia, increased plasminogen activator inhibitor levels, or deficiencies of tissue plasminogen activator or heparin cofactor II may be found.	0.5310926001881081
Klinefelter's syndrome and homocystinuria are prime examples of those rare congenital disorders indirectly associated with an elevated risk of thrombosis in young individuals.	0.5392251051155516
Early diagnosis of these disorders will allow timely treatment, preventive care and counselling of patients as well as family members.	0.6079791206580775
Epidurography with contrast medium is used to verify the correct poition of an epidural catheter and to detect malpositioning.	0.5430213196832525
There is great variability in the distribution of contrast medium according to the individual morphology of the epidural space and the way it is injected.	0.704407407723003
Results of investigations of the anatomy of the spinal canal and epidural space performed with anatomic specimens, epiduroscopy, and conventional and computed tomographic (CT) epidurography are sometimes contradictory.	0.5469520961620418
We have performed CT epidurography in approximately 30 patients to date.	0.4814721837228039
Insights regarding the distribution of contrast medium in the epidural space can help to interpret conventional epidurographies and to explain special features, such as the "rail-road-track phenomenon" or the plica mediana dorsalis.	0.6568150581468543
Patients scheduled for major abdominal operations were studied.	0.31686231134889387
Catheters were introduced into the thoracic epidural space on the day before the operation.	0.5320919171883656
Conventional epidurographies were performed routinely after insertion of the catheters with a mobile X-ray apparatus, usually in the recovery room, using 5 ml iopamidol (Solutrast 250 M).	0.5845810799228288
Selected patients (good mental state and stable psychic condition), after written consent and with approval of the local ethical committee, were investigated with CT epidurography using the same contrast medium (partly diluted).	0.6508938461776513
From among the CT scans performed until now, five characteristic images are presented and compared to conventional epidurographies.	0.725072258081427
When small volumes (5 mL) of iopamidol were injected slowly, we regularly observed a railroad-track phenomenon in the AP images of conventional epidurographies.	0.675377970754858
After rapid injection of larger volumes (10 - 15 ml), the spread was more homogeneous and sometimes outline a lighter zone of contrast distribution in the midline.	0.6611541613003523
CT epidurography in these cases (5 out of 30 patients) revealed a plica mediana dorsalis.	0.8331112365687398
In the majority of the CT scans of the thoracic epidural space its anterior (ventral) compartment was unfilled by contrast medium.	0.6021168496503895
According to the findings of several investigators, dura mater and ligamentum longitudinale posterius have grown together, so that an epidural space does not exist in ventral thoracic segments of the spinal canal.	0.5756680832608095
In lower thoracic and lumbar segments both structures are separate, and a wide anterior epidural space was present and filled with contrast medium.	0.6660756734233251
In other cases the dorsal and dorsolateral epidural space was completely filled, but the contrast medium stopped behind the spinal nerves and surrounding dural sheaths, as if these structures, together with the connective tissue strands between them, formed a membrane that spread in a frontal plane.	0.5881332795113117
A railroad-track phenomenon is interpreted in the literature as the X-ray correlate of contrast medium spread in the subdural space, indicating an incorrect catheter position.	0.6243616657482987
According to conventional epidurographies and confirmed by CT scans, this feature is also seen regulary in cases with correct catheter position.	0.6908383562261783
Small volumes of iopamidol spread preferentially into the wider parts of the epidural space between the gaps of the vertebral arcs, whereas the dura mater and periosteal layers touch at the inner side of the pedicules and laminae, allowing the existence of only a potential epidural space.	0.5833420360477353
This rhythmic widening and narrowing of the epidural space is the explanation of the "railroad track" in AP contrast epidurographies.	0.5361692166752947
CT epidurography is a valuable tool to provide better insight into the morphology of the epidural space when filled with fluid (contrast medium, local anaesthetics), complementing findings using epiduroscopy and anatomic specimens.	0.5337850056198964
It stands to reason that this time- and cost-expensive method can never replace conventional epidurographies, but can help to interpret them properly.	0.7057790217867838
A 71-year-old woman suffered from pronounced erosion of her nose after soft X-ray therapy (total dose 28 Gy, half dose depth 10.5-11.5 mm).	0.710094688426304
5 weeks after the end of the irradiation no healing tendency was observed.	0.4635174416053095
This unusual clinical course was caused by a simultaneously existing pemphigus vulgaris that worsened after radiotherapy, presumably as a consequence of the release of epidermal antigens.	0.5513660201850142
In this case it is improbable that the pemphigus was induced by the radiotherapy, as has been reported on several occasions in the literature.	0.7287515196407336
However, this possibility cannot be entirely excluded.	0.544370774224755
A vascular etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been long debated.	0.4628508251154331
In order to search for an ischemic basis of PD we assessed the clinical symptomatology of a consecutive group of 60 PD patients and compaired their frequency of cerebrovascular risk factors, carotid atherosclerosis and ischemic brain lesions with age-matched groups of stroke patients and normals.	0.5338375687561004
There were 16 (27%) subjects with PD who also had symptoms of cerebrovascular disease.	0.5803375941355062
The frequencies of carotid stenoses, ischemic brain lesions and most of cerebrovascular risk factors seen in the latter group was comparable with those of stroke patients and significantly higher than in the investigational subsets of patients with "pure" PD and normals.	0.6912417530807623
Only one (1.6%) individual with PD presented signs suggestive of an ischemic etiology of parkinsonism.	0.6657622291202715
These findings suggest that cerebrovascular disease occurs in approximately one fourth of patients with PD, but seldomly is causally related.	0.6329981078682984
Neurological involvement is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with sarcoidosis.	0.6913630678628917
The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of patients with neurosarcoidosis.	0.667223927728788
The MRI brain scans of 22 patients with sarcoidosis were retrospectively reviewed, along with the clinical information provided in the request form.	0.5310747797198213
All patients had signs and symptoms referable to the head and were examined with gadolinium enhancement.	0.7371402595810236
Cranial (facial) nerve paralysis was the most common clinical manifestation identified in 10 patients.	0.6901080144874605
A wide spectrum of MR findings was noted: periventricular and white matter lesions on T2 W spin echo images, mimicking multiple sclerosis (46%); multiple supratentorial and infratentorial brain lesions, mimicking metastases (36%); solitary intraaxial mass, mimicking high-grade astrocytoma (9%); solitary extraaxial mass, mimicking meningioma (5%); leptomeningeal enhancement (36%).	0.5747041073880708
The diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis is often difficult, particularly so in patients who lack either pulmonary or systemic manifestations of sarcoidosis.	0.6383146927631788
MRI shows a wide spectrum of brain abnormalities associated with neurosarcoidosis.	0.32444626045224706
These findings, however, are not specific for sarcoidosis and one must consider appropriate clinical circumstances in arriving at the correct diagnosis.	0.621097184779698
In selected cases with isolated brain involvement, meningeal or cerebral biopsy may be required.	0.4713502127344275
In 1990, we first described the papular-purpuric "gloves and socks" syndrome (PPGSS).	0.38812429194017833
It is characterized by an itching erythema and edema of the hands and feet together with oral mucosal lesions and fever.	0.47091242179076204
The skin  lesions subsequently become purpuric and resolve spontaneously after a few days.	0.3692454620104886
In more than half of the patients, an acute parvovirus B 19 infection has been proven.	0.7447828240840123
In a few cases of PPGSS, other viral infections have been found, for example hepatitis B and measles.	0.8550270853072882
We report on a patient with PPGSS and review the literature.	0.6222703398550357
Fungus-bezoars in the renal pelvis are an unusual manifestation of severe Candida albicans infection.	0.3945097223778402
A newborn infant with VACTERL-association suffered from fungus balls in the renal pelvis after Candida albicans sepsis, and developed a hydronephrosis with beginning postrenal failure.	0.43672770374990955
Following systemic antimycotic therapy with amphotericin B and flucytosin as well as local irrigation with amphotericin B via percutaneous nephrostomy renal function normalised rapidly.	0.3893931388662494
Discussion: Since the incidence of systemic mycotic infection in neonates becomes more common the differential diagnosis of nephrolithiasis should include fungus balls.	0.5896544563338594
Interactional understanding in psychoanalysis, especially the concept of the 'third point', suggests that the development of insight, empathy and relationship are dimensions of one and the same triangulating process peculiar to psychoanalytic understanding.	0.6082510375441773
In this context the psychoanalytic method, here understood as working with resistance, transference and countertransference, does not only offer a route to cognition, but also to the formation of a conflict-solving, egostrengthening, and supportive relationship peculiar to psychoanalysis.	0.6073205249794077
The formula 'interpretation on the basis of countertransference' describes a form of psychoanalytic interpretation that takes up this context intentionally and can thus also be used for crisis intervention in the case of neurotic conflicts.	0.502691390361203
This is exemplified by a case history.	0.5223108694656227
The Dutch Supreme Court ruled that in exceptional instances, physician-assisted suicide might be justifiable for patients with unbearable mental suffering but no physical illness.	0.386877142744801
A recent report shows that explicit requests for physician-assisted suicide are not uncommon in psychiatric practice in the Netherlands.	0.493680451638018
Some of those requests were granted and their medical background was described.	0.3316581952044158
Psychiatric consultation for medical patients who request physician-assisted suicide is relatively rare.	0.42036463899588183
Pemphigus is a rare intraepidermal autoimmune bullous disease.	0.5150699690705476
Two major variants, pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF), are distinguished.	0.5323764101855634
The aim of this study was to document the clinical and immunpathological findings in all pemphigus patients who were diagnosed in the Department of Dermatology at the University of Würzburg over the past 10 years.	0.7621662246115901
Post-dural puncture headache (PDPH) is a significant complication of spinal anaesthesia.	0.6466300852852602
Diameter and tip of the needle as well as the patient's age have been proven to be important determinants.	0.8005006772713885
The question of whether post-operative recumbency can reduce the risk of PDPH has not been answered uniformly.	0.6145008810416902
And besides, some studies referring to this subject reveal methodical failures, for example, as to clear definition and exact documentation of post-operative immobilization.	0.6439179843419989
Furthermore, fine-gauge needles (26G or more) have not been investigated yet.	0.547470531180483
The first aim of our study was therefore to examine the role of recumbency in the prevention of PDPH under controlled conditions using thin needles.	0.5393586502451195
Secondly, we wanted to confirm the reported prophylactic effect of needles with a modified, atraumatic tip (Whitacre and Atraucan) by comparing them to Quincke needles of identical diameter.	0.5148524899036271
Most of the former investigators compared Quincke with atraumatic needles of different size regardless of the known influence of the diameter on PDPH.	0.5868014373401046
Three characteristic developments in modern western societies usually are considered to be independent variables in the ethical discussion:...	0.4196375432041378
Background: Neuropathic pain syndromes may be treated by intervention at the sympathetic nervous system.	0.6149891478157856
The pain in these syndromes is therefore called sympathetically maintained pain (SMP).	0.4100745433917784
Typical disorders with a SMP component are complex regional pain syndromes (reflex sympathetic dystrophy and causalgia), traumatic neuralgias and herpes zoster.	0.41867828947862806
The tendency towards sphincter-preserving resection for distal rectal cancers has led to a revival of the technique of coloanal anastomosis (CAA) in recent years.	0.6092341172358028
In order to improve functional results, creation of a colonic J-pouch in conjunction with a coloanal anastomosis (CPA) was proposed.	0.5791085493174273
Two different operation techniques exist: i) Double-stapling with the anastomosis close to the dentate line and ii) intersphincteric resection with the anastomosis located immediately at the dentate line.	0.5888224068987313
A long rectal remnant after double-stapling leads to urgency in 15 % of the patients due to stool retention in the atonic remnant.	0.5580393719869032
No propulsive motility patterns were recorded from the pouch which is emptyed passively by upper colonic peristalsis.	0.30953236714408644
Therefore colonic pouches should be fashionned of descending colon and should not exceed a length of 6 cm in order to prevent stool fragmentation.	0.5046403710216243
Under these conditions the average stool frequency is reduced from 2-6 /d after CAA to 1-3 /d after CPA.	0.7097576101881117
This effect is maximal during the first postoperative months, but is still significant after 3 years.	0.8895066512500938
Colonic pouch construction also leads, due to better blood supply and prevention of pelvic hematomas, to a significant decrease of the anastomotic insufficiency rate from 10,0 % after CAA to 5,4 % after CPA.	0.7721500113461105
Therefore creation of a colonic J-pouch should be combined with coloanal reconstruction if the oncologic situation allows a sphincter-preserving procedure.	0.37817707818247387
Background: Workers in the construction industry carry an increased risk for head and neck cancer due to the high consumption of alcohol and tobacco plus exposure to occupational carcinogenic or co-carcinogenic agents.	0.5981174420096356
These latter substances include asbestos, tar products, metal dust, wood dust, cement dust and paints.	0.3143180334051229
Presently, there are no well-defined standards for documentation of echocardiographic studies.	0.735853530937144
Nevertheless, standards are essential to provide comparability of data and to realize electronic communication, both essential for quality management in echocardiography.	0.6469604126678405
Embolia cutis medicamentosa (Nicolau Syndrom) is a very rare complication of intramuscular injections which presents with extensive necrosis of the injected skin area.	0.5920447710500046
Intra-arterial and/or para-arterial injections after prior perforation of certain vessels are discussed as possible pathogenetic mechanisms.	0.5239415286711192
We describe the occurrence of embolia cutis medicamentosa after intra-articular injections into the knee.	0.5202631196835886
In a 30-beds-unit of the Orthopedic University Clinic in Bochum for an example we studied the frequency of combined injection therapy with local anesthesia and chirotherapy in a one year period.	0.5556529960701777
There have been done 191 injections into ileosacral joints as well as 28 injections into facett joints of the cervical spine and additionally 315 into facett joints of the lumbar spine.	0.4689638330061248
On the other side there have been done 122 chirotherapeutic maneuvers at cervical, thoracic or lumbar spine by senior doctors with education in manual medicine.	0.5816745888517809
The injection therapy however was done in mean predilection sites of the patients suffering from cervical spine disorders or low back pain, the chirotherapy was done in other spine areas.	0.6567317674378836
The growing number of doctors with an education in manual medicine seems to improve the chirotherapy of the mean pathology as well, but it is not able to reduce the number of local injection therapy.	0.6944294934947656
In a retrospective case control study at the University of Frankfurt, Germany, 101 babies born to opiate-addicted mothers were identified from birth charts from 1988 to 1995.	0.5412499446100163
After birth, they developed a withdrawal syndrome (neonatal abstinence syndrome).	0.5309286450272992
Fifty control infants and their mothers were selected from neonatal wards.	0.3822854876062025
The group of opiate-exposed babies was subdivided into a group born to mothers without methadone treatment (n=48) and a group born to mothers who were enrolled in a methadone program (n=51).	0.6207794190655727
The methadone infants had a significantly higher mean birth weight (2822 g) than children in the group without methadone (2471 g).	0.6579999463620957
The abstinence syndrome was much more intense in the methadone group (convulsions 47.1%) than in heroin-exposed babies without methadone treatment (convulsions 27.1%).	0.5492556799119263
Women in methadone maintenance programs lived in more stable socioeconomic conditions than opiate-addicted women without methadone substitution.	0.36106672599801903
Moreover, they cared significantly better for their babies: 81.3% of the methadone mothers visited their children on a regular basis and 90.9% cared adequately.	0.5645419603237994
The data emphasize the need in future research to look more closely at the role of methadone treatment programs in the development of opiate-exposed babies.	0.48685257194638976
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease of high penetrance and variable expression.	0.7178251946386575
Epidemiologic data on craniofacial manifestations are still lacking.	0.28485481406807694
Up until now 74 patients with NF1 have been treated at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of the University of Hamburg.	0.631921663560647
Forty-two patients presented periorbital and orbital neurofibromas varying in extension and in the severity of findings of the affected site.	0.6810025812710706
Surgical therapy is mainly based on tumour reduction, frequently combined with face-lifting.	0.4613755971006077
In our experience neurofibromas of the neck tend to be pseudo-encapsulated, facilitating the preparation of the tumour.	0.6912666787420193
On the other hand, identification and preparation of diffuse infiltrating neurofibromas in the trigeminal nerve region are difficult and local recurrence must be expected.	0.43758907277708436
Objective: The revised Edwards-Duromedics valve was introduced onto the market in June 1990.	0.4189204385754204
In September 1993, the producer changed the name of the valve to TEKNA, which is a low profile, bileaflet, mechanical prosthesis with a self-irrigating hinge mechanism.	0.6713913921254769
The results of a prospective follow-up study after valve replacement with this prosthesis are presented.	0.8498041932588245
A granular cell tumor is one of the rare tumors of the esophagus.	0.6179485324706854
We present the case of a 65-year-old male patient, who was admitted to our hospital for an elective cholecystectomy.	0.741191998537148
In the routine diagnostic gastroscopy an intramural tumor in the distal esophagus was incidentally found.	0.5944976505320559
Repeated endoscopic biopsies did not reveal the histologic diagnosis, although endoscopic ultrasound invasion to the tunica muscularis could not be excluded.	0.5887124837437866
After indicating the operative therapy, the tumor was removed through a thoracoscopic approach.	0.613300072116419
The histologic specimen showed a granular cell tumor of the esophagus (tumor of Abrikossoff).	0.48448790330915176
Since the tumor grade was unknown, our therapy seemed to be justified because of the low risk involved in minimally invasive operative procedures.	0.6680488325054689
There has been much discussion and controversy in the literature on this subject, including the potential for malignancy and the correct therapy regime, with a general shift to conservative or minimally invasive treatment.	0.8521395999631945
The case is discussed with a review of the literature.	0.6824226400696324
This review deals with the differential diagnosis and treatment of critically ill neuromuscular patients.	0.5801776362944077
Acute muscular weakness may be a sign of newly acquired neuromuscular disorders or of an exacerbation of a previously existing disease.	0.5326877273416296
Typical features of the more common neuromuscular conditions are presented and the problems of neurocritical care delineated.	0.7730761130881404
The appropriate ancillary tests are presented.	0.2057825485576561
Psychiatric care for chronic schizophrenic patients has improved in recent years, but for severely ill patients, often with multiple comorbid psychiatric conditions and in great need of care, the situation remains unsatisfactory.	0.658226104195496
Community-based psychiatric care is limited and psychiatric hospitals are now cutting back on inpatient care.	0.46645689499830234
The quality of care that chronically mentally ill patients receive at independant psychiatric nursing homes removed from population centers is undetermined, and many patients end up in asylums or homeless shelters unable to provide for their psychiatric needs.	0.4619246881787726
Neither a reliable way to assess the needs of these complicated patients nor a scientific basis for therapeutic intervention exists yet.	0.47278665010751114
A diagnostic scoring system, recently published by Ohmann et al.	0.4563506759389773
in this journal, was validated by analyzing the clinicopathological data of a consecutive series of 2,359 patients, admitted for suspicion of acute appendicitis.	0.6354223607434558
The results of the scoring system were compared to the results of clinical evaluation by junior (provisional) and senior surgeons (final clinical diagnosis).	0.693597976545246
To assess the diagnostic ability of the score, the accuracy and positive predictive value were defined as the major diagnostic performance parameters; the rate of theoretical negative laparotomies and that of diagnostic errors served as the major procedural performance parameters.	0.7285143775323927
Of 2,359 patients admitted for suspected acute appendicitis, 662 were proven to have acute appendicitis by histology, for a prevalence of 28 %.	0.6051436629027288
The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of the provisional clinical diagnosis were 0.50, 0.94, 0.77, 0.83, and 0.82; 0.93, for the score 0.63, 0.93, 0.77, 0.86 and 0.84, and for the final clinical diagnosis 0.90, 0.94, 0.85, 0.96, and 0.93, respectively.	0.7145231648413252
Of the main diagnostic performance parameter, the accuracy of the score was signifianctly better than that of provisional clinical diagnosis (P < 0.05, 2 test).	0.7287231659160929
The score yielded a rate of negative appendecomies and laparotomies of 14.3 and 12.3 %.	0.572073517706067
With respect to the rate of overlooked cases of acute apendicitis, the score demonstrated a superior performance, with only 6 cases missed (0.9 %).	0.714990237714332
However, the number of patients with acute appendicitis, including those with perforated disease, who were not identified by the score, was almost four times that of the final clinical diagnosis (245 vs 63).	0.8349264309614708
With regard to the main procedural performance parameter, the score resulted in a significantly smaller number of diagnostic errors than the provisional clinical investigator (P < 0.05, 2 test).	0.6368006731028959
The results of this study indicate that the diagnostic scoring system might be helpful when experienced investigators or additional diagnostic modalities such as ultrasonography are not available.	0.722555516894665
It may therefore be of value in the preclinical evaluation of patients with suspected acute appendicitis and may be instrumental as a quality control tool and in clinical guidelines.	0.6240799166264572
Purpose: The standards and regulations concerning the protection of patients and operator staff within the context of MRI are compiled.	0.612068106153351
Resulting consequences regarding physical parameters are evaluated.	0.2131402773944927
Replacement of the tracheal conduit remains an unresolved problem.	0.34089126241267365
The microporous material expanded polytetrafluorethylene (ePTFE) is suitable for tracheal reconstruction.	0.48546366206727737
The aim of our study was to improve the limited mechanical properties of this material by incorporating reinforcement elements and to examine the influence of these elements on host incorporation and epithelialization.	0.6453406201378608
In so dours ePTFE prostheses were reinforced with Ionomer cement and porous high density polyethylene (pHDPE) rings and implanted into the neck muscle of miniature pigs.	0.3144159228599733
One of these prostheses was epithelialized by a cell seeding technique and was thus placed into a tracheal defect.	0.4748510201616112
Results were examined grossly by endoscopy and than by light and scanning electron microscopy.	0.4057196281388629
The shapes of both types of prostheses showed a high stability.	0.4389462662770936
The reinforcement elements did not impair bioincorporation or the ability to epithelialize.	0.347617163391823
In vivo interposition of an incorporated and epithelialized prosthesis to a host led to cell differentiation.	0.3325050129745868
The improved biomechanical properties of the prostheses waid and the reproducible formation of epitheliums are important advances in the solution of effectively correcting tracheal defects.	0.4823123729556886
Primary infection with human herpesviruses 6 and 7 (HHV-6 and HHV-7) during early childhood causes permanent latent infection, usually without any ill effects; only a small percentage of primary infections will lead to exanthem subitum.	0.6586955356424505
Like other herpesviruses, HHV-6 and HHV-7 can be reactivated at any time if host defence mechanisms become defective (e.g.	0.3761023633020322
in transplant recipients, AIDS, tumour patients).	0.43609831108468533
HHV-6 can be reactivated under such conditions and cause a variety of clinical problems, such as exanthems along with interstitial pneumonia or hepatitis for example.	0.4674917252800467
In addition, the reactivated virus may influence the course of autoimmune and proliferative diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and Hodgkin's disease.	0.49788452002300193
While, HHV-7 may be associated with similar disorders, more systematic studies are needed to clarify the clinical implications and the pathogenetic mechanisms of both viruses.	0.5504202621202051
Pulmonary artery catheterization (PAC) is widely used for monitoring and optimization of hemodynamic therapy in critically ill patients.	0.555747582232301
Despite its widespread use there is no clear evidence that morbidity and mortality can be reduced by this approach.	0.7028583201672187
In contrast, it has been suggested that PAC might increase mortality.	0.63384243125596
Available data do not allow the definitive omission of PAC in medical intensive care, nor do they justify its widespread use.	0.49404867160678595
Possible reasons that might affect outcome are catheter-related complications and often misinterpretation due to insufficient knowledge about PAC.	0.5666361342702969
Open questions on the influence of PAC on outcome variables in critically ill patients have to be answered by conducting randomized controlled trials.	0.6177457760096003
Beforehand, knowledge about PAC has to be improved.	0.6237028417008234
As a consequence, PAC should be performed whenever a specific hemodynamic question arises that cannot be answered by clinical judgement or by less invasive means.	0.5403611395691811
It is important that the investigator be experienced in catheter placement and data interpretation to avoid harm to these critically ill patients.	0.460886859328583
A long-term goal of assisted reproduction techniques should be the development of methods which are able to replace the high-dose stimulation with gonadotropins in order to limit the costs and risks of in vitro fertilization treatment.	0.7059859042327682
The in vitro maturation of immature oocytes derived from follicular aspirates and the in vitro growth of early follicles isolated from ovary biopsies are discussed as possible alternatives.	0.5542738486075209
Both methods are able to shift the application of stimulating hormones from the in vivo to an in vitro level, but are today still far away from being established in clinical routine.	0.6474545766472282
The exact knowledge of the topographic anatomy of the urethra as well as the macro- and microcirculation of the penis [6] are the basics of reconstructive urethral surgery.	0.7139122199756156
Adherence to the fundamentals and principles of tissue transfer [5] are necessary to fascilitate conditions for successful treatment of the various disorders of the male urethra.	0.6947684490612402
Mutural description of the anatomy of the male urethra in conjunction with external male genitals is necessary because of developmental similarities as well as the close anatomical relationship.	0.5385173051390792
The arterial and venous blood supply of the urethra and the penis have to be taken into account if vascularized flaps from the penile skin or the prepuce are used in urethral reconstruction.	0.6270297097232844
The dual arterial and venous vascularity of the genital skin is of fundamental importance to a successful outcome of the operative treatment.	0.6652147136437092
The purpose of this article is, to summarize the relevant anatomical knowledge of reconstructive urethral surgery.	0.6797604075158327
In this study the course of osteochondritis dissecans at two often affected areas, the femoral condyles of the knee joint and the talus at the upper ankle joint, is evaluated by studying and comparing the medium-term outcome in 40 patients treated conservatively and 72 patients treated surgically by arthroscopy.	0.766845536589174
The criterion of assessment was magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which shows a close correlation to the arthroscopic stages of osteochondritis.	0.5018906819846071
The stages on MRI follow the morphology of the interface, i.e., the zone between the osteochondral fragment and the parent bone, on T1- and T2-weighted images.	0.5702969960513705
After 18 and 24 months there were no substantial differences visible on MRI between the two different treatment groups.	0.5993431154049469
In fact, in the majority of cases  (> 60%) the MRI result was the same in spite of the treatment that had been carried out.	0.9794066582128743
Arthroscopic treatment compared to conservative treatment resulted in a small percentage in a reintegration in the sense of upgrading on the MRI (36% to 30%); nevertheless, a disintegration could not be avoided in all cases (4%).	0.7245356563101443
In both treatment groups the age of the patient seems to play an important role in the course of osteochondritis, juvenile forms following a milder course than adult forms.	0.6003386862266321
The number of women with congenital cardiac disease, who mature into adulthood is increasing.	0.56664198198383
Unfortunately, there are no prospective data published about the relative risk of different forms of contraception for these patients.	0.6157335442119034
Most women with congenital cardiac disease can safely use oral contracetives, especially low-estrogen combination or progestin-only preparations, with the exception of those, who are at particular risk because of thrombembolic complications (especially in cyanosis, pulmonary hypertension, Eisenmenger reaction, rhythm disturbances), fluid retention (especially in reduced ventricular function and congestive heart failure), arterial hypertension (important in coarctation), infectious complications (endocarditis) or hyperlipidemia.	0.6215564353033751
Oral contraceptives should be avoided in patients at increased risk for thrombembolic events.	0.7422812690919199
Intrauterine devices are very effective, have no metabolic side effects and merely cary a small risk of endocarditis.	0.5649860473340867
Newer devices containing progesterone only may put the patients at a still smaller risk.	0.3722222879320408
Contraceptive subdermal implants (e.g.	0.1367838661494759
levonorgestrel) are used with good results in the United States for patients with contraindications to estrogen-containing oral contraceptives and may well become more widely accepted in patients in Germany in the coming years.	0.6951313906076516
Barrier methods can be used, but have a higher failure rate, which may be inacceptable in patients at risk (e.g.	0.771003649340757
Especially in Eisenmenger's, permanent sterilisation should be advised.	0.2889759412026429
Two groups of 15 patients each with disseminated intravascular coagulation in association with septic disease were treated with low-molecular-weight heparin  (lmw-heparin) in different dosages (group I: 1,5-5 IE/kg body weight (BW) per hour; group II: 8-15 IE/kg BW).	0.769805066277647
We studied the levels of D-dimer, thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT), prothrombin fragments 1 and 2 (PTF), and global tests of coagulation like prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT), thrombin time (TT) and platelet count, plasminogen activation (PA) and fibrinogen concentration to estimate the success of heparin therapy in the two groups.	0.5958005140251985
TT and fibrinogen concentration were not suitable to follow the course of the coagulation disorder.	0.621428984593208
PT, PTT, platelet count progressively PA, D-dimer, TAT, and PTF normalised progressively after heparinisation.	0.5114865731525085
However, only the last three parameters were sensitive enough to show different effects of variable dosages of lmw-heparin.	0.582390923363435
D-dimer, TAT, and PTF levels declined in proportion with heparin concentrations, and thus appear to be the most useful parameters for monitoring the therapeutic effect of heparin in septic coagulopathies.	0.6880201383086912
In patients with acute or chronic myocarditis, arrhythmias are a common and often the only clinical symptom in the natural course of the disease.	0.7007088572216817
The potentially malignant tachy- and bradyarrhythmias are of particular significance in the differential diagnosis of sudden cardiac death in myocarditis.	0.6012933942009123
Factors responsible for the increased incidence of cardiac arrhythmias are structural changes, parameters of ventricular dynamics and vascular changes.	0.5510190339980023
On the one hand, inflammatory processes in the cardiac myocytes and interstitium can lead directly to fluctuations in membrane potential.	0.4722303510643201
Fibrosis and scarring of the myocardial tissue and secondary hypertrophy and atrophy of the myocytes favor the development of ectopic pacemakers, late potentials and reentry as a result of inhomogeneous stimulus conduction.	0.5157854448573252
Furthermore, parameters of ventricular dynamics such as increased wall tension, increased myocardial oxygen consumption and diminished coronary reserve in the case of disturbed systolic or diastolic left ventricular function also contribute to the increased incidence of arrhythmias.	0.5823591999110338
Lastly, vascular factors can further increase the arrhythmogenicity of the inflamed myocardium through the disturbance of micro- and macrovascular perfusion and the resulting myocardial ischemia.	0.6155173387747984
Non-invasive rhythmological evaluation by 24 h Holter ECG, measurement of ventricular late potentials and heart rate variability can be used for orienting risk stratification of the at-risk patient with myocarditis.	0.6287481727429933
Programmed atrial and ventricular electrophysiological stimulation also has a relatively high predictive value for spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias.	0.5754112829052568
It should be emphasized that, at the present time, optimal electrophysiological parameters with a high predictive value do not exist.	0.6574718616272546
In a selected patient population, immunosuppressive therapy in addition to conventional antiarrhythmic therapy can lead to the reduction or complete suppression of spontaneous and inducible arrhythmias.	0.6193905547482528
Nevertheless, in the interim, further precautionary antiarrhythmic measures such as serial antiarrhythmic treatment, VT ablation and AICD implantation are necessary in patients with malignant cardiac arrhythmias.	0.6087114724412777
Right ventricular myocardial biopsy for demonstration or exclusion of myocarditis is an important additional examination which can improve the differential diagnosis and treatment of patients with cardiac arrhythmias of unclear etiology.	0.6896717912493294
Aim: To investigate the distribution of collagens in experimental microvascular surgery.	0.6945423551438739
Material and methods: Autografts (4 mm) of the left common carotid artery in 20 Wistar rats were harvested up to 4 weeks after surgery.	0.7706029287567431
The specimens were investigated immunohistochemically for the demonstration and distribution of collagen III and IV.	0.5223702538586568
Results: The demonstration and distribution pattern of collagens was a function of the accuracy of each single suture.	0.6939767328016706
In the intima, the organisation and amount of collagen IV was directed to the lumen and dependent on the distance and vitality of the vessel segments.	0.5657182361354435
The media had in its axis direction the lowest reparative potential for regenerating the continuity break.	0.31792773845393996
The adventitia formed a thick cuff around the anastomosis, in which collagen III and IV-positive vasa vasorum had grown in a circular fashion.	0.5844420470818957
The marked myointimal hyperplasia in the area around the anastomosis and in the entire autograft was made up of collagen-positive extracellular matrix.	0.6124338517717365
Conclusions: Our results support the demand for a careful and atraumatic suture technique in microvascular surgery.	0.5568991350265095
The identification of collagens in rat vessels is a valuable tool for studying wound healing in experimental microsurgery.	0.5198806800954843
We treated 8123 patients with invasive malignant melanoma were treated up to 1995.	0.3675450605324417
2200 had invasive melanomas with less than 0.75 mm Breslow thickness; of these, 45 developed metastases.	0.5848250613796029
Three had second primary tumors with greater thickness.	0.29745282995888944
One case showed metastasis from another tumor.	0.3578863231092601
In two cases the metastases were not ascertained histologically.	0.6534897228307148
The remaining 39 cases showed some peculiarities: a greater proportion of late and of internal (as contrasted to regional) metastases.	0.5750699092500512
Most of these primary tumors had a Breslow thickness of more than 0.5 mm and were Clark level III or even IV.	0.6816556902875341
Male patients and primary tumor sites in the area of head and neck were significantly over-represented.	0.5239981358821659
In this paper the question is considered to what extent the patient's and analyst's perception and tolerance of both aggressive and destructive elements of the analytic relationship can be increased.	0.749718640363488
Successful interpretation enables the patient to feel, enact and comprehend animosity in the transference and experience that the relationship can continue.	0.4458394211086611
The concept of primary aggression developed in Freud's speculation on death instinct is discussed in its clinical function of relief.	0.5063753433994049
The metapsychological concept of primary aggression facilitates work on aggressive and especially destructive developments of the relationship.	0.4280428683174789
Freud's and subsequently Eissler's examination of the reciprocity of destructiveness and narcissism opened plausible clinical avenues to explain the compensation of defence mechanisms against mankind's vulnerability in the face of mortality.	0.41428051757882134
The concept of primary aggression is obviously of greater relevance than frustration/aggression models since the former does not view the patient as mere victim of his biography, but as a subject with the potential to enact his own destructiveness.	0.5368587918429585
Since aggressiveness is often concomitant with fear and suppressed guilt, interpretation plays a decisive role in relieving the superego strain; more confrontation may involve the analyst in the role of the persecutor.	0.4466915155507967
Sudden and violent feelings of hate towards the analyst require careful treatment of the patient's irritation.	0.6216428346736769
Interpretation of genetic causes of animosity often prove to be countertransference resistance; interpretation in transference, however, is viewed as profitable.	0.4425818162565716
Finally, those dangerous and destructive phases of treatments are discussed, which compel the analyst to protect the setting.	0.5891804674118947
Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common viral agent of severe lower respiratory tract disease in infants and children throughout the world.	0.6662697399940904
Highest hospitalization rates are seen in the second and third month of life.	0.7191951457335932
Young infants, especially those with predisposing conditions such as prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), chronic lung disease (CLD), congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis or immunodeficiency, are the pediatric patients at increased risk for severe RSV disease.	0.6314835405134579
Specific therapeutic options for RSV are limited.	0.3689033232164195
In this prospective study we investigated the efficacy of microcatheter spinal anaesthesia in comparison with a combined spinal-epidural technique in trauma patients.	0.7035140206362195
Background: In Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain and Italy, the OPHTEL project combines clinical centers of ophthalmology and internal medicine, an institute for medical informatics and health services research, a publishing company and different industrial partners in the EDP market.	0.5305778042978645
Purpose: A prospective study was initiated for the correlation of the findings in the initial cranial CT with the long-term follow-up MRI in children with severe head injury.	0.8155085897270432
Another aim was the evaluation of frequency and location of lesions, found only in MRI.	0.5225572178730786
A differentiation is made between patient information on findings and diagnosis, patient information on avoidance of known dangers, and patient information on the risks involved in a particular intervention that has been selected.	0.694369206097481
If no information is given on the risks inherent in a patient's condition and how she must proceed in order to ensure that they do not come about, this is considered to be a treatment error, and in these circumstances the intervention is then legally seen as bodily harm.	0.8160419920507447
Information on the risks involved in an intervention must be given in good time, which generally means on the day before the operation.	0.7022596291503409
An exception is made to this rule for day surgery.	0.3816991331764987
The patient must be informed about treatment alternatives when the method selected is not the method of choice or when there is an alternative offering equivalent chances but risks of a different kind.	0.7283412221005372
Such information is given to the adult patient who is capable of legal transactions.	0.6607168120981318
In the case of minors or of patients who are not capable of legal transactions their legal representative is responsible for receiving the information [and making decisions].	0.5311128337246229
In the case of unconscious patients everything depends on "presumable consent to the operation".	0.4704242868133048
If a patient later cites lacks in the information supplied to her to support a claim for compensation in a situation where it would be unwise to refuse an operation, she must elaborate plausible grounds for being in conflict over the decision even following appropriate information.	0.4281744039662811
Within the last few years the use of Point-of-Care Analyzers increased.	0.6202452915204517
These testing is primarily performed in the emergency room, intensive care units, and in the operating room using small portable analyzers.	0.8453260941308441
The fact of being transportable and working with rechargeable or changable batteries and disposable cartridges caused us to use blood gas analysis in the prehospital setting.	0.38460017703779303
Patients undergoing major vascular surgery frequently require a substantial intraoperative fluid replacement to assure hemodynamic stability, which is in excess of the expected fluid requirements due to starving, blood and insensible losses.	0.5551797032370134
This leads to a positive fluid balance which can not be readily explained.	0.5971018521445128
The case of a 57 year old patient is reported, who suffered from an acute myocardial infarction with maximum CK and CKMB values of 821 and 84 U/l, respectively.	0.6421363127005911
The patient underwent bicycle exercise testing 9 days after a myocardial infarction in 25 W steps every 2 min starting with 50 W. The ergometry was interrupted at 125 W because of ST segment depression of 0.28 mV in V6.	0.518143902376578
Systolic blood pressure dropped to 55 mm Hg, combined with severe angina and shock.	0.5331616946526682
Volume substitution and catecholamines did not elevate blood pressure.	0.2678046352657052
Immediate M-mode and Doppler echo revealed a "stiletto"-shaped mitral regurgitation profile typical of acute mitral valve insufficiency.	0.5275862932441421
The transesophageal echocardiogram showed a distinct mass moving between the left ventricle and left atrium, diagnostic of papillary muscle rupture.	0.5372347735740395
Despite of shock, mitral valve replacement was performed successfully.	0.4452414706461513
To our knowledge, this is the first report of a papillary muscle rupture during exercise testing after myocardial infarction.	0.6103336076485238
The flow directed balloon-tipped pulmonary artery catheter introduced by Swann and Ganz 1970 has made possible the measurement of filling pressures in the heart and is extensively used in operating rooms, in catheterization laboratories and in intensive care units.	0.5347847936044171
The rupture of the pulmonary artery is an uncommon complication associated with a high mortality rate exceeding 50 percent.	0.8299464811256847
Main symptoms are cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea and cardiac shock.	0.387900320908407
Complications occur if guidelines for the safe use of the balloon-tipped catheters are not strictly followed: Excessive catheter manipulation, advancing the catheter tip too far peripherally and leaving the inflated balloon in the wedge position for long periods should be avoided.	0.4892418986861627
Patients with pulmonary hypertension as well as elderly and anticoagulated patients are at greater risk.	0.542143839602395
On 90 patients with 93 unstable fractures of the thoracic spine and the thoracolumbar junction we treated by a minimal invasive procedure between may 1996 and april 1998, in 46 patients an endoscopic splitting of the diaphragm was performed.	0.6903793787173872
The diaphragma was dissected at its attachment at the spine and the adjoining costal base.	0.42032715716375124
After partial corporectomy and discectomy, a tricortical bone graft has been inserted.	0.42202546832681315
An additional stabilization was done by using a plate and screw system.	0.6450660010675241
The incision of the diaphragm was closed by suturing or using an universal endostapler.	0.46904869304082514
Controlling the postoperative results a complete closure of the incision was documented by X-ray and CT-scan.	0.6464553252935955
There was no conversion to the open procedure or postoperative infection.	0.5883339729656172
Splitting the diaphragma opens also the thoracolumbar junction to a minimal invasive treatment and stabilization of fractures.	0.50244265722905

Overall more than 90% of our patients have been treated continuously in our clinic.	0.8548387423148329
Combining modern diagnostics with early onset rehabilitation seem advantageous.	0.3214588510249913
About 220 knee endoprostheses are implanted at our clinic annually.	0.33477138978042675
This is a routine procedure for the instrument staff.	0.7369246467913315
Practice has shown, however, that deficient operating room management as regards the instruments, implants, operating room staff, and surgical planning causes problems.	0.6296567721506
As a result of this, a prophylactic search for sources of error began (risk management).	0.5488650886491873
If the sources of error are found, described, and remedied, knee endoprosthetic surgery will be successful for both the patient and the surgical team.	0.7377776744640856
Cooperation and communication among manufacturer, surgeon, and surgical nursing staff should serve to minimize forensic risks.	0.5571323887451929
The obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia pneumoniae has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis since viable pathogen has been recovered from plaques.	0.34253873794446416
Chlamydiae are epithelial pathogens notorious for causing persistent infection.	0.16689947610312278
Atherosclerosis, however, is a chronic inflammatory disease involving mesenchymal cells of the vascular wall.	0.7669612109774806
A bacterial contribution to atherosclerosis appears more relevant if the resident mesenchymal cells of the vascular wall that constitute the plaque can support chlamydial infection continuously.	0.44005348761478785
The study consists of a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.	0.8200241221372156
Besides medical and sociodemographic data, two personality factors - self-efficacy and locus of control - were found to predict postoperative pain.	0.7976310700638487
Self-efficacy describes the expectations of a person to successfully execute the behavior required to produce behavioral outcomes.	0.4616299596187698
Locus of control, in the extreme case, is a personality factor which is represented by an internal orientation in which the individual believes that rewards are brought about by his own action, versus an external orientation, in which the individual believes that rewards are the result of powerful others or chance factors and fate.	0.6536698668445134
We postulate that the two personality factors correlate with postoperative parameters of pain and that there are also multiple correlations between them.	0.6032649589158866
At present there is neither an completely inert biomaterial available, nor does a universal test exist which objectively evaluates biocompatibility.	0.3980147598260326
One reason is the individuality of the host, especially with regard to the inflammatory response.	0.7548995929234971
Inflammation was found to induce biodegradation by hydrolysis or auto-oxidation of vascular prosthetic matrix after implantation.	0.41231760247983784
The present study was performed to investigate the specific humoral immune response after implantation of segments of a collagen-impregnated polyester prosthesis (Dacron) in Balb/c mice on experimental days 1, 18, 38, and 322.	0.7324320586681791
Serum antibody detection was performed by modified enzyme immunoassay using the prosthesis as a target.	0.524400031173731
Specific polymer antibodies, enhanced by repeated implantations, could be detected in all mice which received grafts up to experimental day 322.	0.5502133666528655
These antibodies were not directed against the collagen coating.	0.4119570304818877
The antibody formation could be further enhanced by a combined administration of complete Freund's adjuvant together with the first implantation at experimental day 1.	0.4377479522724806
Results suggest that specific polymer antibodies, reflecting an inflammatory response, might be an additional parameter for biocompatibility testing of vascular prostheses.	0.4748177156485679
Twenty-nine unicondylar fractures of the distal femur were treated at the Trauma Center "Bergmannsheil", University of Bochum, Germany, between 1981 and 1994.	0.6655313230726154
All patients sustained their injuries from severe direct trauma.	0.29028638554016684
There were 16 lateral condylar fractures, 7 medial condylar fractures and 6 tangential posterior ("Hoffa-type") fractures.	0.6165742546728815
Twenty-eight closed injuries and 1 grade IIIB open fracture were included.	0.40358380593210424
Eleven patients sustained concomitant injuries to the skeleton.	0.3739445559684877
All fractures were treated with open reduction and internal fixation with screws within 8 h of admission.	0.6330968846008531
Postoperative management consisted of early continuous passive motion and minimal weight-bearing for 6-8 weeks, progressing to full weight-bearing.	0.5326095887783558
The mean follow-up was 68 months (18-120).	0.7310027012391127
The therapeutic outcome (clinical result, radiographs) was rated by the Neer score.	0.6976043842024735
Twenty-seven patients were available for follow-up examination.	0.8012692898569935
Of these, 23 were rated as excellent.	0.4527798300647706
3 achieved satisfactory results, and 1 had an unsatisfactory result.	0.6782849077166584
All patients who did not achieve an excellent outcome had had accompanying injuries.	0.5261021190418763
Open reduction and internal screw fixation of unicondylar femur fractures provided overall excellent long-term results.	0.5155306545619573
The therapeutic outcome was significantly affected by associated injuries of the skeleton.	0.5561028273352565
The realization that a disease will not respond to a curative treatment causes massive fear and anxiety in affected patients, but also feelings of helplessness and insecurity in health professionals caring for the patients.	0.6029516685151168
The global fears of affected patients can be divided into three main categories of problems; stepwise mastering of these problems may help to maintain or restore an acceptably high quality of life according to the WHO guidelines for palliative medicine.	0.5727981382176257
In light of the anxiety felt by physicians and others caring for this patient group, palliative psycho-oncology must offer patient-centered holistic care in which the psycho-oncologist is not an isolated therapist but rather a member of a team made up of physicians, nurses, religious workers, psychologists, ergotherpists, physiotherapists, social workers, and especially family members.	0.5619673787748533
Together, this group of health professionals and family members caring for the affected patient form a group that itself receives care as needed.	0.5560539664087146
Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) with hepatic vein occlusion is a rare disorder that can effectively be treated in advanced stages with orthotopic liver transplantation.	0.6672586672226684
We report on 16 patients who received 18 liver grafts and were followed up for at least 2 years.	0.7151694923642633
In 7 patients a hematological disorder was confirmed by bone marrow biopsy.	0.5893810108654232
One patient died after 4 months due to cytomegalovirus pneumonia; another patient died after 2 years due to progressive liver failure after portal vein thrombosis.	0.6153867247887744
The actuarial 5-year survival rate is 87.5 % compared to 85.3 % in all other 710 orthotopic liver transplantations performed from September 1988 to December 1995 at our institution.	0.7280392303961987
Anticoagulation consisted of intravenous heparin and overlapping continuation with dicoumarin.	0.3193115783797509
Three patients received hydroxyurea for thrombocytosis, one patient for 1 week only early after the transplantation.	0.6044932622092011
Two postoperative abdominal hemorrhages required laparotomy.	0.1599913400461228
Two patients had to be retransplanted, one for thrombosis of the hepatic artery and portal vein after discontinuation of dicoumarin due to GI bleeding and one for hepatic vein thrombosis after insufficient dicoumarin intake.	0.5741527807493302
Terminal BCS represents a good indication for orthotopic liver transplantation; however, life-long, closely monitored anticoagulation is essential.	0.4517814504929678
Postmenopausal estrogen-replacement therapy maintains bone density as assessed by densitometry of skeletal sites relevant for future fracture.	0.3832354884633641
Optimal doses are 2 mg oral estradiol, 0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogens, 1.25 mg estrone and 50 µg transdermal estradiol.	0.4970721592751066
There is a role for calcium supplementation in individuals with non-optimal dietary intake of calcium.	0.5041442596375898
Observational studies suggest that estrogen replacement reduces the future risk for hip fracture by 25 %.	0.46875725179593436
Discontinuation of replacements is associated with an increase of fracture risk few years later.	0.6054247806942815
It is noteworthy that there is a lack of formal fracture studies providing data on the efficacy of estrogen replacement for primary prevention of osteoporosis and for secondary prevention in terms of treatment of women with established osteoporosis, with a diagnosis based on WHO criteria.	0.6444408117968086
Raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, and tibolone, a synthetic steroid with weak estrogenic, progestogenic and androgenic properties, may constitute alternatives to estrogen-replacement therapy.	0.5864458658755349
Raloxifenen maintains bone density in and reduces vetebral fractures by some 50 % in women with prevalent osteoporosis.	0.6363795988478296
Artificial insemination from donor (heterologous insemination) is a rationally based treatment in complete male infertility.	0.4750330909146214
In this overview the enlarged knowledge on semen donors, the receiving couples and the development of the offspring will be summarized.	0.5063603885733836
Although motivation of men towards semen donation is predominantly based on financial expectancy, most of the donors agree to offer the offspring not-identifiable information on biological and social characteristics.	0.42600749932296766
Semen donation does not enhance the risk of consanguinity and of genetic diseases in the population.	0.48607028005100217
The decision to undergo heterologous insemination is a burden for the couples.	0.4592920295439643
Retrospectively, however, the majority state positive influences of the insemination on their partnership.	0.5948201057019509
The most important question is whether they should disclose the insemination to the children.	0.5497788202665163
The course of the pregnancy and the postnatal development of the children do not differ from those of children of natural procreation.	0.7163120330719615
They receive more love and care than "usual" children.	0.28884588857043525
Their rights concerning the insemination, however, are poorly considered.	0.46829259854073507
If we agree that the knowledge of genetic descent is part of human rights, non-disclosure of the donor insemination to the children raises severe ethical problems.	0.44286925321017784
The extended field of view imaging procedure named "SieScape" provides, for the first time, a mode of establishing in real time a sonographic picture up to 60 cm in length.	0.5801987646300368
This allows the display of large organs or tumors as well as large areas of the body in a single view, without having to assemble several pictures.	0.6363467178078605
Furthermore, pathological find-ings can be shown in full size in their surroundings.	0.44132054637335694
This method makes it considerably easier to convey sonographic results to the therapist who is not present at the investigation and to control a finding, for instance a tumor, during therapy.	0.6259189966281445
Heart rate variability (HrV) has been established as an important risk parameter in patients surviving myocardial infaction.	0.6984054124601144
Recently, analysis of HRV - particularly of the standard deviation of NN intervals (SDNN) - from short term ECG recordings has been proposed as an alternative to that from 24 hour Holter monitorings.	0.728297516479635
The present study is the first to compare SDNN from short term recordings to that from 24 hour recordings with respect to risk stratification after myocardial infarction.	0.6973493997546933
In 60 patients at the time of discharge from the hospital, SDNN from Holter monitoring averaged 93  +/-  30 ms compared to 39  +/-  18 determined from short term recordings.	0.6789735296054862
Patients with a prospectively defined clinical endpoint differed significantly from those with an uneventful course with respect to age, left ventricular ejection fraction, mean RR interval from Holter recording ( 753  +/-  153 vs 921  +/-  132 ms), mean RR from short term recording (783  +/-  153 vs 914  +/-  163 ms), and SDNN from the Holter recording (71  +/-  27 vs 97  +/-  29 ms; p < 0.001) However, patients with and without clinical event could not be seperated by means of SDNN measured from short term ECG registrations (35  +/-  22 vs 41  +/-  19 ms; P = NS).	0.6848717630166
Thus, SDNN measured from short term ECG recordings does not seem to be useful regarding risk stratification of patients after myocardial infarction.	0.6162227913255007
Analysis of HRV should be performed using 24 hour Holter monitoring, which provides more information and reflects circadian fluctuation in autonomic tone.	0.6258635517120082
Glomus tumors (glomangiomata) are benign tumors arising from glomus cells.	0.5362545421538413
Multiple glomangiomata are less frequent and less painful than the solitary variant, which is usually located subungually.	0.6627954760616637
Nonetheless multiple glomangiomata - sometimes being sensitive to pressure and changes in temperature - may cause considerable discomfort.	0.6660235337667152
Treatment of multiple glomangiomata is problematic because of the often large number of tumors.	0.5747622437905392
Sclerotherapy represents an alternative to surgical and cryosurgical therapy.	0.46404835956480756
We report on sclerotherapy in a 35 year old female patient with multiple hereditary glomus tumors.	0.6652435360648896
Conventional echocardiographic methods of measuring left ventricular mass (LVM) are limited by assumptions of ventricular geometry and image plane positioning.	0.530985420618838
Three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography offers a promising new approach for more accurate determination of LVM.	0.43386523323999804
This study was performed to compare LVM measurement by one- (1D), two- (2D), and 3D echocardiography with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients (pts) with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).	0.8464555034603053
Determination of Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) can be performed through washout methods, indicator gas dilution or bodyplethysmography.	0.4816431494931949
Some of these techniques have been adapted for use in intensive care patients whilst being mechanically ventilated.	0.8063560914802509
However, most measurement setups are bulky, cumbersome to use and their running costs are high.	0.4997909477511916
Hence FRC measurement has not become a routine method in intensive care although it offers considerable advantages in the management of ventilated  patients such as the determination of "best PEEP", the detection of progressive alveolar collapse in the course of acute lung injury and during weaning from mechanical ventilation.	0.5890803448344519
Up to now most efforts to improve and simplify FRC measurement were made at the expense of accuracy.	0.45778563358261176
An ideal method ought to be accurate, easy to handle and cost-effective.	0.5118027549929138
It should supply not only FRC data but also information about intrapulmonary gas distribution and dead space.	0.3550378032852164
These demands can be met using modern data acquisition software.	0.3010033180110747
The pros and cons of all methods available for FRC measurement are discussed in view of their suitability for intensive care patients.	0.5989527505441139
A conventional nitrogen washout using emission spectroscopy for measurement of nitrogen concentration gives satisfying exact values for the determination  of the parameters mentioned above.	0.5238082503582632
The measurement error can be lowered under 5% by special corrections for flow and  nitrogen signal (delay and rise times, changes of gas viscosity).	0.528182281498407
For flow measurement a normal pneumotachograph can be used.	0.5036481087854631
Using a laptop computer for data  acquisition the bed-side monitor fulfills most of the demands in intensive care.	0.40527030009941023
It is then also possible to measure indices of intrapulmonary gas distribution such as Alveolar Mixing Efficiency and Lung Clearance Index.	0.388068479829357
Three strategies are followed in handling the key issue within the field of action of care and services for the elderly: securing the material needs of those requiring care, creating appropriate care structures, and providing an effective counselling back-up to alleviate interface problems.	0.5572868320348386
Thouse latter, process-oriented aids, have been the subject of discussion and further development under the key term of case management for a good decade.	0.7105505638970713
The aim in this context is to prevent the elderly from being unnecessarily moved into residential care, to stop the revolving door syndrome, to ensure that older people can stay in their homes, to support family members acting as care providers, to enhance the quality of services and those to ease the strain on fund providers.	0.6564218843784779
In the context of case managment, these diverse tasks are performed by three basic substantive functions: the gatekeeper, broker, and advocacy functions.	0.5673047174875223
Each of these three functions characterizes the main variants of case management with a different weighting (care management, community care, managed care and case management as a counselling approach with a particular focus on individual help).	0.5482243660530114
Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a bullous autoimmune disease of the elderly; it is characterized by tense bullae on both erythematous and otherwise apparently normal skin.	0.5918351572031074
Several clinical variants of BP have been described, and we now add our observations of two BP cases mimicking subacute prurigo.	0.5383855287428
Both patients had suffered from intensely pruritic excoriated papules for several months before presentation.	0.4408367046154121
Blisters had never developed and did not occur during follow up.	0.5063221921263625
Histology showed changes of chronic dermatitis.	0.2940163527401774
In the serum of both patients, indirect immunofluorescence on NaCl-separated human skin revealed the presence of circulating antibodies binding to the roof of the artificial blisters.	0.5315711491223889
Perilesional skin biopsies showed linear IgG or C3 deposits in the basement membran zone.	0.3305839477105667
Immunoblotting of epidermal and dermal extracts demonstrated the binding of the antibodies to an epidermal 230-kD protein, which is the known major bullous pemphigoid antigen.	0.5675469102306981
These cases are described as a basis for discussion of the clinical spectrum of bullous pemphigoid.	0.7627704807034317
The distal metatarsal osteotomy according to Magerl allows correction of a hallux valgus deformity by lateral and plantar displacement as well as by pronation and varisation.	0.4670530271184043
The length of the first metatarsal can be adjusted by the depth of the cut at the resection or by a slightly oblique osteotomy.	0.6585065550513235
If necessary, soft tissue release and/or a osteotomy of the first proximal phalanx can be done to relocate the sesamoids under the head of the first metatarsal.	0.7224746969967323
A review of 118 foot operations in 75 patients demonstrated a very good or good result in about 75 %.	0.6101387560181893
Radiological examination showed sufficient lateralisation of the metatarsal head.	0.3335845664551881
Evaluating the length of the first metatarsal and the amount of variation, the results were less satisfying.	0.9321408865990926
The metatarsophalangeal angles could be corrected by 14  ° and the intermetatarsal angles by 7  ° on average.	0.5203328107953638
The sophisticated operative procedure limits the use of this technique as a standard procedure.	0.6973410801501073
The contribution of Rudolf Virchow to dermatology seems to have been forgotten, or present-day dermatologists are not aware of it.	0.5219570591076605
The present historical review is intended to show that Virchow's thoughts and the terminology created by him are still alive.	0.472072476803597
The report encompasses a short biography, including Virchow's nonmedical activities.	0.4804770826422186
It starts with early experimental publications, which laid to the foundation for his fame, and with dermatological studies of his early period.	0.6195435180494165
This is followed by a detailed description of his contributions pertaining to dermatology in his largest work, "Cellularpathologie".	0.5730789022326102
Special mention is made of Virchow's lasting contributions to medical, and particularly dermatological, terminology.	0.5043178005658888
Finally, his historical studies, his latter small publications on topics in dermatology, his pupils and scientific friends, and the social-political and anthropological activities of later years are discussed.	0.6016211932096943
Thus, a multifaceted picture is painted of a still modern pathologist who has influenced dermatology in multiple ways.	0.4551771981492622
Starter's pistols are often bought for self-defense, but can also be used for criminal activities (e.g.	0.6071890539428436
assaults, etc.).	0.24476371167265734
When a starter's pistol is loaded with blank cartridges and is fired, a powerful shooting noise results.	0.4174746966591534
The level of the noise produced is high enough to cause acoustic trauma.	0.46819253452620274
For legal examinations and giving an expert opinion further information is needed about the power of such noise.	0.4479446362815917
We examined how high peak sound pressure levels were of the gunshots of blank cartridges and whether there existed any directional characteristics from the noise emissions.	0.40944475604991387
In all, 15 different models of starter's pistols of 8 different calibres were examined.	0.44837205913687167
In addition to blank cartridges, 8 mm tear gas cartridges were also examined.	0.5702631364561024
Four transducers were situated in the horizontal plane around the muzzle: 0 ° (shooting direction), 45 °, 90 °, and 180 ° (towards the firer).	0.6435232592822483
The distances between the transducers and the muzzle were 25 cm, 50 cm, 100 cm, and 200 cm.	0.5857646983350753
At a distance of 1 m and in the 0 ° shooting direction the peak sound pressure levels of nearly all weapons tested exceeded 160 dB.	0.5346905206840835
At a shooting distance of 25 cm the peak sound pressure levels reached 181 dB.	0.36808988397167497
In addition, we observed a directional characteristic concerning the emission of noise: pistols produced higher peak sound pressure levels to the front than backwards towards the firer.	0.5130485823891731
Owing to their rare incidence, foreign body injuries in the region of the orbit, skull base and skull have up to now mostly been treated in  the literature by means of case reports.	0.6479561838545806
Here we present our experience and treatment regimen for ten patients we have treated during the last 3 years.	0.7517328764254106
In seven cases the foreign body was located in the orbit alone, whereas in three others the orbit and the frontal base were equally involved.	0.6339049670316019
Except for one case, the foreign material could be removed completely.	0.6798221138282645
Three patients suffered from partial or complete loss of vision and one patient developed a psychosyndrome during the follow-up period, but no late effects were registered in the remaining six cases.	0.808706080324818
Before removing the foreign body and carefully reconstructing the accident, however, we strongly recommend the documentation of possible functional deficits, preferably by means of photography.	0.5501989588623957
CT is the method of choice for localising the foreign body, except for the depiction of wood particles.	0.6642267181118451
Here, sonography and MR should be performed.	0.5746111309441072
As the therapeutic approach, the cooperation of an interdisciplinary team of ophthalmogists, neuro- and maxillofacial surgeons seems mandatory.	0.6635869146500937
To avoid inflammation, the immediate removal of the foreign material is recommended in cases with considerable intracranial lesions: post-operative neurologic and intensive care monitoring should be provided.	0.7350476317974097
Treatment is completed by high-dose antibiotics, using CSF-soluble substances and, if necessary, anti-convulsives.	0.6474843487715523
Rocuronium is a new nondepolarizing muscle relaxant for which a fast onset has been described.	0.586455508112782
The goal of this study was to examine whether the characteristics of rocuronium could make it an appropriate relaxant for the anaesthetic management of operations of intermediate duration such as endoscopic upper airway surgery.	0.529458193098248
These operations, which require the anaesthesiologist and surgeon to "share" the patient's airway, require good muscle relaxation for endotracheal intubation and placement of endoscopic instruments.	0.7169151346955374
In addition, the time course of neuromuscular blockade and its relation to the quality of intubating conditions were analysed.	0.6658573877792003
Patients and methods: In order to better define the potential advantages and risks of laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), we designed a prospective study including 73 eyes.	0.6302746418751654
Treatment of tachycardic atrial fibrillation (AF) is difficult in patients with congestive heart failure because many drugs which exert negative dromotropic effects (beta-blockers, calcium channel antagonists) may depress ventricular contractility and/or decrease arterial blood pressure.	0.5676349638489926
We have identified 2 intravascular sites in the superior (SVC) and inferior vena cava (IVC) where parasympathetic nerves, which innervate the atrioventricular node, can be stimulated electrically.	0.6089349621756277
In 8 dogs, a 7-F catheter with an expandable electrode basket at its tip was non-fluoroscopically positioned in the SVC and in the proximal IVC (time for positioning: 3-5 minutes).	0.6836355252188978
High-frequency electrical parasympathetic stimulation (PS) with 20 Hz at an impulse duration of 0.1 ms was performed during pacing induced AF.	0.6157121544291169
Results: With increasing stimulus strength, a graded ventricular rate slowing was observed during PS in the SVC and IVC (P<0.01, ANOVA).	0.6496828489004044
The negative dromotropic effect started instantaneously after onset of PS and ceased immediately after termination of PS.	0.3837491789437462
During ventricular pacing at a constant rate, no decrease of the arterial blood pressure was observed during PS.	0.8567446320330209
PS in the IVC yielded significantly lower stimulation thresholds than in the SVC.	0.5322025174778812
Conclusions: Transvenous parasympathetic stimulation for ventricular rate control during AF can easily be achieved in the SVC and IVC in dogs.	0.5114084264959706
This procedure may provide a foundation for investigating the usefulness of PS in humans.	0.4542741760944858
If the results translate to patients, PS may be very beneficial in the treatment of AF in patients with congestive heart failure.	0.5012776113658759
A total of 86 patients suffering from fractures of the thoracolumbar spine were followed up after an average time period of 57 months (12-98).	0.7264249933836507
Of these patients, 56 were treated operatively and 30 conservatively.	0.7107093711496341
According to the AO/ASIF classification, 66% of the operated group were fractures of type A, 29% of type B, and 5% of type C. All patients were operated on by means of dorsal locking instrumentation with pedicular fixation and, apart from six patients, with transpedicular cancellous bone grafting.	0.9131219072638191
The conservative group was treated according to the guidelines of Böhler with closed reduction, plaster cast, and rehabilitation program.	0.6177303747773896
All fractures in the conservative group were of type A.	0.7091204310110979
Charcot foot in its original sense is equivalent to stage 4 of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN) which is known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease since 1886.	0.541713153312567
This entity, which can be subdivided into 3 groups including subgroups, predominantly begins during childhood and progresses slowly.	0.5726561010449163
The first symptom, often unnoticed by the patient for a long period, is weakness of the intrinsic foot muscles with consecutive hammer-toe formation and mobile pes cavus.	0.7355348020150889
Progredient atrophy of the peroneal, extensor, tibialis posterior and finally triceps surae muscles leads to fixed pes cavus varus excavatus with severe varus deformity of the hindfoot, secondary varus position of the talus at the ankle level and subsequent arthrosis of the medial compartment.	0.5581240014061882
Permanent varus deformity of the ankle almost invariably leads to stress fractures of the malleoli because of repetitive microtrauma (stage 5 of HMSN).	0.57959179152959
The alveolar adenoma of the lung is a rare benign tumor in which the normal parenchymal architectur is imitated by a proliferation of both the alveolar epithelial cells and the mesenchymal septal cells.	0.7473038753037635
The first description, based on six cases, was published in 1986 by Yousem and Hochholzer.	0.5561553288862676
From their ultrastructural findings they presumed a type II pneumocytes differentiation of the epithelial cells.	0.5432539650684529
We investigated an alveolar adenoma of the lung immunhistochemical by means of antibodies against apoprotein B and C of human surfactant.	0.5397944847753415
Both the lining cells and the macrophages in the alveolar-like spaces were stained.	0.5590590983633005
The septal connection tissue cells did not react.	0.26875495023374274
These findings confirm the expression of surfactant constituants and, hence, the differentiation into type II pneumocytes of the epithelial cells of the alveolar adenoma.	0.6783315885857286
Breast cancer is the most frequent malignant tumor in women, whereas it is rare in men.	0.8629613936284561
In our own case series the ratio is 175 : 1.	0.5531101421735004
The present paper deals with an evaluation of clinical and morphological findings from a series of 54 de novo male breast cancers observed in our institution from 1978 to 1996 and a comparative discussion of 528 female breast cancers from the same geographic area.	0.601687337223075
We should like to focus on the following observations:	0.5353022221302249
Patients with congenital varicella syndrome develop cicatricial skin lesions and microphthalmia.	0.44855223955696105
An overlap in the clinical manifestations exist with a specific genetic disorder, called MIDAS syndrome.	0.5526647862749933
It is due to a partial deletion of the short arm from chromosome X, with consecutive monosomy Xp22.3.	0.6714147778940251
The rapid development of recombinant DNA technology and our enhanced understanding of the genetic basis of human disease has facilitated the development of new molecular therapeutic modalities, termed gene therapy.	0.5449114017602616
Gene therapy involves the transfer of functional genes into somatic cells and their expression in target tissues in order to replace absent genes, correct defective genes, or induce antitumoral activity in the tumor-bearing host.	0.6069816382616798
Currently, an increasing number of gene therapy strategies are being investigated in experimental and clinical trials.	0.6207835976963576
Despite substantial progress, a number of technical and logistical hurdles must still be overcome before gene therapy can be safely and effectively applied in the human patient.	0.5544382306218623
Since gene therapy involves complex cell processing and can be time consuming and costly, simplifications or even alternative approaches will be necessary in order to establish this therapy as suitable for clinical use.	0.5462395347260451
This report reviews various gene therapy stategies and gene delivery techniques currently under clinical or experimental investigation.	0.33128254485909914
Special emphasis is given to cytokine gene therapy using gene-modified tumor vaccines for cancer treatment.	0.3837581498040563
Using the PTB simulator, which emits real signals from patients, we examined the precision of the oscillometric blood pressure measurement with the Dinamap 1846 (Critikon) and the HP M-1008B (Hewlett Packard).	0.6205243067017596
For this purpose we simultaneously registered invasive arterial pulsewave, cuff pressure and cuff pressure oscillations of 20 patients from our intensive care unit and stored them in the database of the simulator.	0.5648309789431173
The invasive reference blood pressure values were determined following the recommendations given by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation.	0.5627278963920938
The invasive system showed a cut-off frequency of 35 Hz; the damping constant was 0.21.	0.5182564591416235
With 49 record signals from patients we carried out 15 simulated measurements each.	0.33190012630203763
From a total of 49 bio-signals from patients the Dinamap 1846 was able to process 41 signals and the HP M-1008B 47 signals.	0.4446632100750552
The mean error of the oscillometric blood pressure measurement of the systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure amounted to -2.50 mmHg, 3.35 mmHg (P<0.05) and 1.51 mmHg with the Dinamap 1846 and to -8.5 mmHg (P<0.001), -5.15 mmHg (P<0.001) and -5.58 mmHg (P<0.001) for the HP M-1008B.	0.7884280209319781
The 95% confidence limit for the systolic, diastolic and the mean arterial pressure amounts to 56 mmHg, 30 mmHg and 35 mmHg for the Dinamap 1846 and 50 mmHg, 38 mmHg and 35 mmHg for the HP M-1008B.	0.5236543365776666
The differences between that two instruments could be caused by the different algorithms for the calculation of blood pressure values and different artefact detection and elimination techniques.	0.6002131378984379
The results of the performance tests we achieved with the PTB simulator correspond to the results of other clinical examinations.	0.6434248894862811
The American Association for the Advanecement of Medical Instrumentation recommends a maximum mean error of 5 +/- 8 mmHg.	0.5419143887959652
None of the examined instruments lay within these limits.	0.4691830826059668
Due to the systematic and stochastic errors, we think that the Dinamap 1846 (Critikon) and the HP M-1008B (Hewlett Packard) do not achieve performance levels that are adequate for measuring critically ill patients.	0.5267817153123008
Many patients consulting medical emergency services make the initial contact because of psychiatric emergency situations.	0.3618362707930774
However, emergency physicians and their assistants are usually not sufficiently experienced in psychiatry.	0.5432301543960393
Therefore, psychiatric emergencies are sometimes only reluctantly accepted or inadequately treated by these services.	0.4153365884092778
Our present contribution aims at improving this situation.	0.27063597049364096
It gives a review of the main diagnostic groups concerned, their symptomatology and psychopathology, and offers some advice with regard to empathic verbal interventions and counselling in those emergency situations.	0.6148030083895898
3 different types of complex spinal trauma are defined: Type I means a multilevel contiguous or non contiguous unstable injury, type II is described as a spinal injury with concommitant thoracic or abdominal lesion, typ III stands for the coincidence of spinal injury and polytrauma.	0.538626838780177
Overlapping of different types occurs.	0.4362821020630722
Type I: The incidence amounts according a german multicenter study to about 2,5 %.	0.7101469348642483
Multilevel injuries need to be stabilized for a long distance from posterior.	0.5692860811388583
With a thoroughful analysis the segments to be fused are determined.	0.397622972153766
Typ II: The leading thoracic injury is a lung contusion which occurs in up to 50 % of the cases.	0.6948620951257466
A CT scan of the thorax during the first diagnostic screening is recommended.	0.6210195150551356
Early reduction and stabilization from posterior should be aimed at.	0.3958367648282602
During the first two weeks anterior procedures are contraindicated.	0.676942490618324
Abdominal injuries are to be found in 3-4 % of all spinal injuries.	0.8760946784165857
All organs could be affected.	0.2262211560875916
A typical constallation is the "seat-belt syndrome" with lesions of the upper abdominal organs and a flexiondistraction injury of the upper lumbar spine.	0.6653074396688361
The main problem is to make the diagnosis of both components initially.	0.7018684762332692
Most of the patients may be treated in one operation by first taking care of the abdominal injury and than stabilazing the spine.	0.7923643537448212
The prognosis of this combination is favorable.	0.6198926865199579
Typ III: In 17-18 % of all polytraumatized patients lesions of the spine are to be diagnosed.	0.8795460765418747
From these only one third need surgical care.	0.39605212818748037
From 680 patients with operatively treated fractures of the thoracolumbar junction 6,2 % were polytraumatized according to the multicenter study mentioned above.	0.6594581696592966
The risk of missing a spinal injury in polytrauma totals approximately 20 %.	0.4237958192936401
Surgical stabilization should be performed in the primary phase (day-1-surgery).	0.8697404095905464
Additional injuries, potentially time consuming operations with a high blood loss sometimes necessitate a different approach.	0.6048188145615296
Non stabilized spinal injuries apparently do not have the same negative effect on the whole organism as long bone fractures.	0.6037613882769861
In the early phase of treatment on the C-spine only anterior procedures and on the thoraco-lumbar spine only posterior techniques should be applied.	0.6784900484866659
Experimental studies have shown that in traffic accidents with frontal impact the new airbag system can significantly reduce the incidence of severe injuries and fatal outcome.	0.5238917585505888
The question of whether the airbag itself induces specific patterns of injury needs further investigation.	0.5072650273256952
Two cases of traffic accidents with airbag protection are presented here.	0.49966052954233625
The first case report clearly shows the life-saving and injury-reducing effect of the airbag system in a traffic accident with frontal impact at 100 km/h.	0.555511815131825
In the second case only minor injuries of the face were diagnosed initially.	0.7409314075394159
Hemodynamic instability occurred after 3 h of hospitalization due to rupture of the azygos vein.	0.4609518332056364
Analysis of the presented cases shows that, besides the well-known benefits, there are certain injury patterns that seem to be related to the use of airbags.	0.7304363938073908
These have not been described before.	0.5312216232434076
It is concluded that patients who were involved in traffic accidents with airbag deployment have to be hospitalized and followed up carefully over time, even though they are initially stable, as potentially fatal sequelae of deceleration trauma can occur later.	0.6593881587473664
In our opinion it is not possible to estimate the severity of airbag-associated injuries with conventional methods.	0.744444653846786
A questionnaire with 78 questions concerning the situation of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) sufferers in Germany was distributed to a representative 3000 out of the more than 14000 patient members of the German AS society; 1614 patients (54%) responded.	0.6771619001223317
The age distribution of these patients roughly agrees with that expected due to the distribution of the age at diagnosis and the age distribution of the German population.	0.8700618806109524
The group of patients more than 65 years old is, however, under-represented.	0.6376082321462592
Introduction: Headache is thought to be generated by nociceptive processes within the meninges, followed by activation of trigeminal neurons within the brainstem.	0.4494204092292005
The noxious stimuli initially involved in these nociceptive processes are unknown.	0.31362031049299627
A preparation was developed in the barbiturate-anesthetized rat, in which the activation of trigeminal brain stem neurons by selective local stimulation of the dura mater could be observed.	0.639089759345583
Atherosclerosis is a complex multifactorial disease of the arterial wall, dependent on genetic disposition and multiple other risk factors.	0.6320799778746307
There are probably several candidate genes, that determine the individual susceptibility of the vessel wall to develop atherosclerosis.	0.6400437630374856
In recent years, a growing number of gene polymorphisms, associated with an elevated risk of myocardial infarction, has been identified.	0.7794151119676208
These genes and gene clusters play a crucial role in lipid metabolism, regulation of blood pressure and clotting.	0.5568224166204606
In contrast to rare monogenetic diseases with severe clinical signs and symptoms (e.g.	0.45607093713100955
familial hypercholesterolemia), genetic polymorphisms are relatively frequent.	0.3375461032112665
Due to their frequency, there is a high probability that one individual carries several alleles predisposing to coronary heart disease.	0.6554793814850086
Genetic polymorphisms become clinically important by interacting with lifestyle, environmental factors or endogenous metabolic disorders.	0.34672228814346706
Fourty-nine patients with 50 complex acetabular fractures were treated with open reduction and internal fixation from August 1993 to February 1996 in a prospectively documented study.	0.5536090920121218
The fractures were fixed with small fragment implants through a modified extensile iliofemoral approach (Maryland approach).	0.4288824683782376
Thirty-seven patients were polytraumatized with an ISS of 20 pts.	0.5164767599760451
In 10 patients the ISS was > 25 pts.	0.6425628343575179
Good or anatomic initial fracture reduction with a fragment stepoff K 2 mm could be achieved in 48 fracturers (96 %).	0.5116031062446597
Thirty-six patients with 37 fractures could be evaluated after 25 months on average.	0.5033704537149449
In 28 fractures (76 %) the functional outcome was good or excellent according to the d'Aubigne and Harris scores.	0.6665672746152874
Radiological results were excellent in 21 fractures (57 %) and satisfactory in 12 fractures (Heeg score).	0.6448665402531825
In 7 cases (14 %) a postoperative subcutaneous seroma had to be treated surgically.	0.7208810367093069
No wound infections, however, were observed.	0.6442660082522885
Further complications were secondary a loss of reduction in 4 cases (11 %), relevant heterotopic ossifications (Brooker III/IV) in 5 cases (14 %), and aseptic femoral head necrosis in 2 cases (5 %).	0.7395508604066835
In two cases a total hip replacement (THR) for posttraumatic arthritis had to be performed.	0.7432897875751557
Two more cases are scheduled for THR due to symptomatic femoral head necrosis.	0.3309386214183351
A good joint reconstruction can be achieved through the modified extensile iliofemoral approach (Maryland) in complex fractures of the acetabulum.	0.6774163847686208
However, the approach related morbidity seems to be worrysome.	0.617081771045089
In complex fractures with comminution in the roof of the acetabulum the prognosis remains uncertain even in cases where initial anatomic joint reconstruction can be achieved.	0.5856074070932028
The discussion on the results of open spinal surgery, in particular, on complications as a result of open surgery, e. g., the so-called post-discotomy syndrome, has led to the development of less invasive methods, especially for treatment of lumbar disc prolapses.	0.7582666280049145
Percutaneous nucleotomy procedures are based on a variety of intradiscal diagnostic and therapy methods, such as discography, retroperitoneal spinal disc fenestration or chemonucleolysis.	0.543260046372648
Since the 1970 s, various methods such as mechanical percutaneous nucleotomy, automated percutaneous nucleotomy, intradiscal laser procedures and, in part, endoscopic intradiscal procedures have been developed and also used clinically.	0.6511840484666467
The clinical results vary from 30 % good/very good results to almost 100 % good/very good results, depending on the author and study.	0.6199380839788371
It is obvious that not many prospective randomized studies using either conservatively or surgically treated control groups have been conducted.	0.4720704161188647
The results of these studies on intradiscal therapy methods are often analyzed more critically and with lower success rates than the partially retrospective studies of a single method, which often have large case numbers, but do not always meet the demanding criteria for scientific study design.	0.642749084632094
To attain good results, percutaneous nucleotomy procedures can only be used to treat select cases of lumbar disc disorders according to strict indication criteria.	0.6415617167647587
At the present time it can be concluded that, in comparison to endoscopic und microsurgical methods, percutaneous nucleotomy procedures must be restricted to a small number of cases.	0.6784773314493548
A 58 year old patient with hepatitis virus C (HCV) infection had a secondary polyclonal IgG-IgM cryoglobulinemia with a benign 20 year course.	0.4673381907786257
Clincally the patient suffered from progressive pigmented purpura (PPP).	0.2843276108931347

In most of the previously described cases of HCV and type III cryoglobulinemia, the typical cutaneus finding was palpable purpura with leukocytoclastic vasculitis.	0.5741961074053968
Normal aging is associated with changes in body composition, thirst perception, renal function, and the hormonal regulatory systems involved in the maintenance of water and sodium balance.	0.6557476409574101
The presence of many diseases and drugs common in the elderly can interact with the impaired homeostatic systems to result in clinically significant disturbances of water and sodium with accompanying symptoms, morbidity, and mortality.	0.5887252227302563
These disorders, which include dehydration, hypernatremia, hyponatremia, urinary frequency, and urinary incontinence can either be prevented or promptly recognized and appropriately treated by understanding the physiological changes and clinical circumstances which put the elderly person at increased risk for deranged water and sodium balance.	0.5906460712681659
Although valvular stenosis may be evaluated adequately by measuring transvalvular pressure gradients with Doppler echocardiography and cardiac catheterization, these methods have failed to provide reliable and accurate quantification of valvular regurgitation.	0.5229491345656543
In recent years the development of magnetic resonance imaging has broadened the diagnostic spectrum in cardiology, since it allows assessment of ventricular volumes without geometrical assumptions and the non-invasive quantification of blood flow within the heart and great vessels.	0.6689463135371485
The purpose of this overview is to evaluate "established" diagnostic tools and to show the capabilities of magnetic resonance imaging in the assessment of valvular heart disease.	0.6773115791121127
Solvent induced polyneuropathy and encephalopathy have been acknowledged quite recently as occupational diseases in Germany.	0.34984312439188453
For compensation first of all the diagnosis has to be proven.	0.6226545911494443
For differential diagnosis other known causes as well as non-organic mental diseases must be taken into consideration.	0.3888532347029437
The causality between proven exposures and diagnosed disease has at least to be probable.	0.2975250390888954
To evaluate causation extensive experience of the experts is needed.	0.3850283136264197
In this context scientific criteria regarding neurotoxicity of the solvent, duration of exposure, individual aspects of non-occupational influences, time course of the disease are important within a thorough synoptic evaluation.	0.6427212338490136
Possibilities and limitations of sensitive diagnostic measures such as neurographic, neuropsychologic and neuroimaging examinations are discussed.	0.3503131217065563
The prognosis of toxic polyneuropathy and encephalopathy is in general favorable if exposure has stopped.	0.46441495166723096
Additionally, adequate therapy and rehabilitation measures are supportive for a good prognosis.	0.577057708665566
Standard radiography of the cervical spine is still the first imaging procedure applied in degenerative disease of the cervical spine.	0.61624224586617
Spondylosis deformans, osteochondrosis and uncovertebral arthrosis are well depicted by such images.	0.2932425895924871
Whether or not additional imaging is needed depends on the clinical symptoms.	0.6590890211296059
Special projections (anteroposterior oblique radiographs, lateral radiographs in flexion and extension) may be the next step.	0.6733159543732897
For many abnormalities, mainly of the intervertebral discs and the myelon, MR imaging has become the standard procedure, largely because of its multiplanar capabilities and its excellent contrast resolution.	0.6959644102116356
CT can be used instead of MR imaging if the latter method is not available, and its strength lies in the depiction of bone abnormalities.	0.7533412634209499
Scintigraphy is suitable for early detection of abnormalities with unclear clinical symptoms and may then indicate the correct level of the cervical spine for MR imaging or CT. Myelograms and myelo-CT can no longer be considered routine imaging methods.	0.5712561186507957
A number of imaging abnormalities are not strictly related to clinical findings and should therefore always be discussed in the clinical context.	0.804444270627749
We report on three years of experience with a new method of a simultaneous endoscopically assisted anterior release in the prone position, combined with transpedicular posterior scoliosis correction and fixation.	0.6536998293110251
In 60 cases this simultaneous approach yielded substantial advantages.	0.25749001646093184

Magnetic resonance imaging is used routinely with much success for various problems in different medical disciplines.	0.468522275027196
However, the patient is exposed to static as well as to time-dependent magnetic fields and radio-frequency electromagnetic fields.	0.8166714313945372
In 1997 the Strahlenschutzkommission, the German Radiological Protection Commission, passed a recommendation on the use of magnetic resonance in medical diagnostics.	0.5764699204464585
In this recommendation basic values related to thresholds for physiological effects and limits for restricted and unrestricted use are given.	0.33494558037426936
In the following the aim and applicability of this recommendation are discussed, as well as the thresholds and different limits for the static magnetic fields, the gradient fields and the radio-frequency fields.	0.6089849314795044
Additionally, advice is given for the protection of high-risk patients, personnel, and the general public, together with further safety advice as well as recommendations for users and manufacturers.	0.7256391637040748
Six patients with granuloma faciale, including patients with multiple lesions, were treated successfully with cryosurgery.	0.8555457162197575
Granuloma faciale is known to be difficult to treat.	0.6259768124339714
Cryosurgery is an effective and minimally invasive therapy for this granulomatous inflammation of the skin.	0.7528601994622572

There were statistical evaluations and X-ray observations of healing in both groups, as well as the appearances of the most frequent complications such as: Pintract infection, osteitis, pseudoarthrosis and reoperation.	0.6151129499959348
Statistically less significant appearance of complications in A group during 2th and 6th month (p < 0.001) was observed.	0.5969758228299705
In 12th month of observation, these differences statistically disappeared.	0.4701707658730429
Healing observed by X-ray in 2th, 6th and 12th month of observation were no statistically significant differences between the two observed groups.	0.5463074705969311
Since 1993, 30 patients with acute intraarticular distal radius fractures have been treated under arthroscopic assistance.	0.6157930531237445
In 12 patients (40%) concomitant lesions of the intrinsic scapholunate ligaments were diagnosed.	0.5878775656536732
According to Geissler we found grade I-tear in one patient, grade II in three, grade III in six and grade IV in two patients.	0.5896783556172189
The eight individuals with grade III-and IV-lesions additionally revealed marked instablity intraoperatively.	0.41457378609585227
Therefore, operative stabilization was subsequently performed by temporary scapholunate and scaphocapitate arthrodesis.	0.5176347812095345
Seven patients out of this group (87.5%) were followed up clinically and radiologically 3 years postoperatively, on average.	0.8240566238935417
Clinical examination included range of motion tests and a subjective questionnaire concerning pain and working ability.	0.49004863358668826
Objective grip strength was measured using a Jamar tester and compared to the contralateral wrist.	0.5714132737052958
Radiological evaluation consisted of the posteroanterior and lateral view as well as stress views in radial and ulnar deviation.	0.3764627212132571
Data were evaluated by the Jakim and Cooney scoring system as well as the demerit point system by Gartland and Werley as modified by Sarmiento et al.	0.3846348870997657
According to Gartland, 100% of our patients showed an excellent result; these rates were 86% using the Jakim score and 60% using the Cooney scoring system.	0.7367938347293724
According to the subjective questionnaire all of the patients revealed an excellent or good result.	0.822885866831371
Open treatment of shoulder instabilities is well accepted and still golden standard.	0.4847076044317723
But arthroscopic techniques show also good and comparable results.	0.30964020767487976
Arthroscopic procedures however are not accepted for treatment of failures and revision cases.	0.4179410270305949
Therefore we questioned whether a arthroscopic revision procedure is an option after failed first time open or arthroscopic stabilization.	0.45215545271719837
This prospective study was designed to assess the outcome of arthroscopic revision procedures after failed shoulder stabilization.	0.632796285591233
In 1991 the diagnosis of cerebral circulatory arrest with Doppler sonography was accepted by the Medical Council of the Bundesaerztekammer as one of the methods able to shorten the waiting time for fulfilling the criteria for diagnosis of cerebral death.	0.6061693221255222
A survey was undertaken to determine how frequently Doppler sonography has been used since that time in certifying brain death.	0.4790075006586915
A total of 400 questionnaires were sent out to all neurological (272) and neurosurgical (128) departments in Germany.	0.5624293988112364
In all, 226 questionnaires were returned.	0.2841390803676281
In 71 departments, Doppler sonography has been used to certify brain death, mostly combined with other methods.	0.6498158941477561
The question of whether false positive results have been observed was answered five times in the affirmative.	0.6032818513375382
The background to these cases was clarified by telephone calls.	0.4061096602289073
In order to indicate pitfalls, the examiners reported borderline situations which in part did not fulfil the prerequisites.	0.48296851530100443
In none of these cases had the diagnosis of brain death been based on ultrasound data.	0.7437587828138337
Doppler sonography for the diagnosis of cerebral circulatory arrest has been used by a considerable number of neurological and neurosurgical departments in Germany as an additional confirmatory test and rather seldom as the only method to shorten the waiting period.	0.6539281509155237
We report on a 64-year-old man who died within 1 h after admission to hospital with symptoms of respiratory insufficiency.	0.7289612382299194
Autopsy showed as cause of death a clinically unknown coagulase-negative staphylococci-induced left-sided endocarditis with perforation of the aortic and mitral valve.	0.5734590929188756
Infective endocarditis by coagulase-negative staphylococci in native valves is a rare event.	0.48290803430175827
The macroscopic appearance and histological findings are presented and discussed.	0.5339182170239792
Thrombolysis therapy in childhood and adolescence has brought about numerous case reports, but no controlled studies over dosage and duration of therapy have been published to date.	0.6786831621686994
Laserotoscopes are suitable for low-pain outpatient surgery of otitis media with effusion (OME) under topical anesthesia.	0.46455260894412

Comparison by skin epiluminescent microscopy of 60 malignant melanomas and 130 junctional and compound naevocellular naevi revealed statistically significant differences for 12 characteristics.	0.3810926080941354
The following microscopical in vivo signs that can be defined by histopathological examination were found only in malignant or premalignant melanocytic lesions: digitated radial streaming, greyish-blue reticular patterns, opaque gypseous alabaster lacunas, brown/black dots on a blue/greyish background, pseudopodia at the periphery and blue-in-pink areas.	0.4132845136567404
Nevertheless, specific epiluminescent phenomena of histopathologically defined malignant melanomas are still unknown.	0.4014769506080925
Therefore, diagnostic evaluation of malignancy is based mainly on microscopic assessment of combined details of morphology and colour of melanocytic tumours.	0.526048481384895
The present study examines the relationship between different psychological variables (including anxiety, depression, locus of control, expectations of pain intensity and social support) and postoperative pain, analgesic consumption and satisfaction with the pain management in a study sample of 67 patients.	0.73065344400924
Clinical experience of 11 patients with CHARGE association is reviewed.	0.41504845224089765
The study comprised six girls and five boys.	0.2898673418473956
All presented with congenital heart disease.	0.367228994682615
Eight had bilateral choanal atresia.	0.21436443728014787
Coloboma affecting either one or both eyes was detected in nine children.	0.45960895425987364
Nine patients suffered abnormal pinnae or deafness.	0.23814975335931404
In addition to major abnormalities, further anomalies of the orofacial region and the upper airways occurred in all patients.	0.7342526251240075
All children exhibited velopharyngeal incoordination and swallowing problems often resulting in recurrent aspiration pneumonia.	0.260897266043673
Three patients had cleft lip and palate.	0.4794986837353741
Both micrognathia and high-arched palate were present in two patients.	0.5564214033105108
Facial palsy was observed in six patients.	0.5597565118789563
Optimal management requires a multidisciplinary approach with active coordination and cooperation between the appropriate specialities.	0.45759393800059844
The anatomical repair of bilateral choanal atresia should be performed as early as possible.	0.5661977166553547
In our experience, the transpalatal approach is far more satisfactory than the transnasal.	0.560241898093053
It gives the surgeon the opportunity of direct access and anatomical repair.	0.42500319233590544
After the child has grown stronger, a long-term management is desirable including developmental and feeding training.	0.5720727925453805
Thrilling are especially those situations, when people have to make ethical decisions.	0.48210453356202704
Issues of medical ethics crop up not only in hospital series, but often in genres where this subject is hardly to be supposed: comedies, westerns, love stories and gangster movies.	0.49204891775115456
Enacting these conflicts means offering a solution, and in doing so films refer to moral values and - at the same time - function as seismographs for the social relevance of bioethical topics.	0.6818827409803355
But it is possible that ethical principles of good decision-making fall victims to the drama of the story.	0.5500042744404688
Analysis of the portrayed conflict is similar to a case discussion in bioethics and represents a helpful adjunct to the procurement of analytical and communicative competences.	0.4247903625067056
Several experimental studies and randomized clinical trials demonstrate a decrease of local tumor control with increasing overall treatment time of fractionated radiotherapy.	0.5335980496157895
Proliferation or clonogenic tumor cells most likely is the major mechanism underlying this phenomenon.	0.4363628147625841
Important progress in radiation oncology might therefore be expected from inhibition of proliferation of clonogenic cells during radiation treatment.	0.4138851669469351
Possibilities to minimize the time factor are briefly discussed.	0.5526889807415791
Inhibition of proliferation of clonogenic tumor cells during irradiation by simultaneous chemotherapy, by inhibition of signal transduction pathways that stimulate proliferation, or by pharmacological inhibition of angiogenesis are scientifically interesting but currently not proven to be effective to counteract the loss of local tumor control with increasing overall treatment of fractionated irradiation.	0.5558475020815306
At present, the only established approach is to complete radiotherapy within a short overall treatment time, e. g. by accelerated fractionation and by prevention or compensation of unscheduled treatment gaps.	0.5533609776399716
Technical innovations and software improvements in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and high-resolution sonography (US) have definitely influenced the diagnostic imaging of rheumatic diseases.	0.6492021252990298
For MRI, improvements in surface coils, dedicated low-field systems (0.2 T), and software improvements (shorter acquisition times and refinements of fat suppressing techniques) must be mentioned.	0.6012334451930041
For sonography, the main innovations concern the development of higher transducer frequencies (7-15 Mhz) and power Doppler imaging.	0.7106382876174026
Clinical evaluations have shown that MRI and US are most useful in cases of suspected rheumatic disease with negative plain film radiographs and for documenting the course of the disease, diagnosing of early rheumatoid arthritis, making a differential diagnosis in clinically unclear rheumatic diseases, investigating vascularization, and quantifying pannus formation.	0.5842200101983367
In order to improve diagnostic efficacy the role of MRI and US in the management of patients with rheumatic disease should be reconsidered.	0.666191981778184
In addition to renal elimination and gastrointestinal metabolism (amylase; splenic and hepatic dextranase) colloid plasma solutions like dextran and hydroxyethyl starch deposit in tissues, especially in the reticuloendothelial system (RES).	0.4667696766080858
This tissue storage is limited in time (weeks to months), is influenced by the employed solution and other factors (lysosomes) and has usually no clinical importance (no RES blockade).	0.7036048462721938
We report here a case study of a patient with sepsis (lung, liver and kidney failure) who had an overload of the RES with colloids while being treated with dextran (molecular weight 40000 and 70000 daltons) and hydroxyethyl starch (mw 450000 daltons, molar substitution 0,7).	0.6068285325736833
In the late seventies and early eighties the toxic shock syndrome (TSS) became epidemic among young menstruating women.	0.4147934841772631
A strong correlation was found between TSS and the rising popularity of hyperabsorbent tampons.	0.4942923796089802
Exotoxin-producing Staphylococcus aureus is seen as the main mediator of TSS in controlled clinical trials.	0.5321744036622459
Menstrual and nonmenstrual forms of TSS are differentiated.	0.27324388031234625
The nonmenstrual form is comparatively rare and has a high rate of mortality rate.	0.585168878755364
Several studies showed that the overall incidence of menstrual and nonmenstrual TSS is approximately 1-3 cases per 100 000 persons.	0.6107521330110208
The leading symptoms are fever, hypotension, mucous membrane hyperemia, diffuse rashes, myalgias, vomiting and diarrhea.	0.43741816847876136
The severe form of the syndrome leads to multiorgan dysfunction.	0.5058299799208762
The streptococcal TSS (STSS) caused by group A Streptococci is clinically similar to the staphylococcal TSS.	0.408543111956591
Both Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococci produce the exotoxin TSST-1.	0.21505298883932897
New methods allow the detection of TSST-1 production.	0.3355833020085743
However, due to the low incidence of TSS, this method of detection has not yet been taken up in the routine diagnostic procedures.	0.7663810477882074
This report focusses on the emergence and spread of S. aureus with special clinical and epidemiological significance.	0.5541733338261676
Results from typing MRSA originating from different clinical sources in all Germany reveal that there is a continuing interhospital dissemination of definite epidemic strains and also a spread of the mecA gene to clonal groups of S. aureus which have been until now sensitive.	0.5021957996497693
These newly emerging MRSA are still sensitive to a number of other antibiotics.	0.41176044979733195
This results in less broad resistance phenotypes of currently disseminated MRSA.	0.29829340598569204
Worth mentioning with regard to diagnostics are also three clinical cases of staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome caused by S. aureus possessing secC and not tst.	0.4869545655381721
Background: For cataract surgery in this country retro- and peribulbar anesthesia is the standard method.	0.7421823488666996
It totally stops eye movement as well as sensitivity to pain.	0.3133050694203536
Especially peribulbar anesthesia is known as a procedure with minimal complications, but the potential risks can be severe.	0.7411342798354129
In the past sponge anesthesia could not be used on patients with difficult cataract surgery due to the insufficient anesthetic effect.	0.6887644733767817
A modified anesthetic method is demonstrated for complicated cataract surgery.	0.3491417072118009
In patients with coronary artery disease, it is controversial whether cardiac arrhythmias result from acute subendocardial ischemia.	0.571766614618415
The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between myocardial ischemia and ventricular arrhythmia.	0.6066647303783117
The immunopathogenesis of cardiac rhythm and conduction disorders has been underestimated.	0.35364395922295416
Therefore, the aim of this review is to analyze the current data and controversial issues in this area.	0.7377959480414125
We report the case of an 8 year old boy with a rare congenital myopathy (with cytoplasmic inclusions bodies) and clinical signs of rigid-spine-syndrome.	0.7098759420955195
During treatment of lung tuberculosis disordered breathing with hypoventilation during REM-sleep, hypoxemia and persistent hypercapnia during daytime were found.	0.37796758329883734
This complication in myopathies is caused by weakness of respiratory muscles and leads to negative features (like pulmonary hypertension, daytime-sleepiness, growth failure or further impairement of the muscle disease).	0.47451699333803965
Diagnostic steps in disorders of breathing during sleep in children with neuromuscular disease are shown.	0.5394797955421887
Aortic dissection with no entry or false lumen flow was recently identified as intramural hemorrhage of the aortic wall (IMH).	0.4843294078781988
Analysis of the literature revealed 209 cases of in vivo diagnosed IMH reflecting 17% of all dissections, whereas in autoptic studies this condition is found in 4-13%.	0.8115480450014885
Transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and aortography (to rule out dissection) have been applied for diagnosing IMH in 57, 49, 43 and 38% of the cases, respectively.	0.6391375562319057
However, diagnostic accuracy of each modality is not available to date.	0.6805954369325297
In 34%, IMH involves the ascending aorta (type A).	0.5569275020566086
The average age of patients with IMH ranges between 55 and 65 years; 65% are males.	0.7009365821147979
In 12%, IMH was associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm.	0.5438070949280581
With 87%, arterial hypertension is the predominant risk factor for IMH irrespective of its location.	0.5648971212543095
As suggested by the term "mediastinal apoplexy" IMH may - similar to cerebral apoplexy - result from hypertensive rupture of the vasa vasorum in the aortic media.	0.5442029185908779
With 97%, the majority of patients present with acute chest or back pain similar to classic dissection.	0.6042215164669317
Mediastinal widening is found in 83%; signs of hemothorax/pleural effusion are present in 38%, acute aortic regurgitation in 26%, pericardial effusion in 23%, acute neurologic deficits in 12%, and pulse deficits in 5%.	0.5833827694637255
In 18%, IMH progresses to dissection and in another 15% to rupture.	0.7338763601351934
In 25% and 28%, respectively, dissection and rupture occur in the ascending aorta and in 12% and 9%, respectively, in the descending thoracic aorta.	0.8043598463265997
The 30-day mortality of IMH is 24% (36% with type A and 12% with type B IMH; p<0.05).	0.6825265621576346
With surgical repair, mortality of type A IMH is lowered to 18% compared to 60% with medical treatment (p<0.01).	0.6437254825856388
In contrast, with 8% mortality associated with medical treatment, prognosis of type B IMH is more favorable without surgical intervention, the latter associated with a 30-day mortality of 33% (p<0.05).	0.693942948347817
Thus, IMH is a potential precursor of dissection and should be managed like dissection with undelayed surgical intervention in patients with type A IMH and with medical treatment in type B IMH.	0.7160026046167897
We report on 3 exemplary case studies of patients with myelomeningocele who are under regular care in our outpatient clinic, and discuss the clinical and diagnostic problems and the therapeutic concept of fractures in patients with myelomeningocele.	0.825836072765183
Our case reports are in accordance to previous publications; they show that signs of confined and systemic infection and variable X-ray signs with often extensive reactive formation of callus make the diagnosis of fractures in myelomeningocele patients difficult.	0.5252490620943022
Fractures often occur without pain or trauma.	0.2454757339406105
Background: Since the end of the 1960ies, accidents have been identified as the most common cause of mortality in children and account for considerable childhood morbidity in industrialized western countries.	0.7372165026028347
In contrast to traffic-related accidents in older children and adolescents, which were consequently registered and documented, no epidemiological data exist about home injuries and accidents during the first years of life in Germany.	0.7640298449641943
This report presents data on accident-related hospitalizations in a cohort of 10271 infants, who participated in a prospective vaccine efficacy trial in Germany from 1991 to 1994.	0.6096594661245612
One-hundred-thirty patients underwent 53 electrophysiological studies including programmed atrial and ventricular stimulation and 96 atrial overdrive stimulations on an outpatient basis.	0.4182995005383002
The indications for electrophysiological study were disabling palpitation, syncope, or presyncope, intracardiac conduction disturbance, and bradyarrhythmia.	0.577939309424529
In one patient the efficacy of oral antiarrhythmic drug therapy was evaluated by repeat electrophysiological study.	0.6119231829720362
Atrial overdrive stimulation was performed in patients with atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia.	0.6871016621147026
On the basis of the result of electrophysiological testing, 25 patients were believed not to require any treatment, 16 patients received new drug therapy, 7 patients underwent catheter ablation in a second session, 2 patients had either a pacemaker or an ICD implanted, and 1 patient continued to receive the drug therapy that had been tested.	0.7999529882519008
Atrial overdrive stimulation resulted in a regular sinus rhythm in 66 patients (69%).	0.4806359770148171
Except for one patient in whom atrial flutter could not be terminated, atrial fibrillation was induced in the remaining 30 patients.	0.7679835159030716
After the procedure, patients were monitored for 30 min in case of overdrive stimulation, and for approximately 3 h after electrophysiological study or 6 h if additional coronary angiography had been performed.	0.752320044147671
Severe complications were not observed.	0.2764551013077421
In 10 cases minor hematoma occurred at the puncture site without serious sequelae.	0.40156728834208727

Endosteal implants after tumor surgery of the face are helpful in reconstructing facial defects.	0.5627403254454352
A retrospective study of our patients treated using craniofacial implants was conducted to evaluate long-term results.	0.7588052563564655
A total of 128 implants were inserted, 110 implants in the periorbital, 12 implants in the mastoid, and six implants in the paranasal region; 113 implants were short craniofacial Brånemark implants, and 15 implants were dental implants.	0.6470021490152117
The success rate for implant survival was 94.5%.	0.5740823521274407
Long-term results were promising and more than satisfactory, leading to a large indication for these endosteal implants.	0.6775000788162422
The term "Ecstasy" includes a group of different methylenedioxyamphetamines which produce hallucinogenic activity, stimulation and the so-called 'entactogenic' effects.	0.45415360327532156
- "Entactogen" is usually translated as "producing a touching within" or "creating an internal contact" and refers to the special psychotropic effect of this substances.	0.7161949604960164
Entactogens have been reported to make users aware of previously unconscious feelings and experiences.	0.490822006141739
The "entactogenic" effect is the most typical of the psychedelic effects n 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDMA).	0.5748372028699689
MDMA induces euphoria and acts stimulating, but the most common effect of MDMA is a heightened sense of "closeness" with other people.	0.6911228527495852
The negative effects, especially depression and a general sense of anxiety, may endure after the acute phase of ecstasy.	0.7561939726378403
Ecstasy is not a novel substance.	0.6110463325020142
However, the rapid spread connected with the arising techno-scene and the increasing prevalence of ecstasy-use world-wide is unprecedented.	0.5862771683474337
Cisatracurium - one of the ten stereoisomers of atracurium - is an intermediate long-acting non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent.	0.7083696294855677
Cardiovascular reactions have been described after administration of cisatracurium or vecuronium in surgical patients.	0.6213119625218029
After approval by our institutional review board, 62 patients (ASA I-II) were randomly assigned to three groups to either receive 3xED95 or 5xED95 of cisatracurium or 3xED90 of vecuronium prior to intubation as a bolus.	0.49595237245956336
After oral premedication with 2 mg lormetazepam anaesthesia was induced with thiopental (4-12 mg/kg) and maintained with O2/N2O and isoflurane (1.5%-2%).	0.7085712378993989
Six minutes after administration of thiopental, patients received the muscle relaxant.	0.7235694929965132
Six minutes later 0.1-0.2 mg fentanyl was given and the trachea was intubated.	0.6298310247675587
Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were monitored every minute.	0.6610109061748038
Changes of heart rate or blood pressure >20% compared to baseline were defined as clinically significant.	0.6520130414441986
After application of the study drug, median values of blood pressure and heart rate were stable.	0.7826833754377907
For each muscle relaxant, there were several patients who had statistically significant cardiovascular changes.	0.756352118874868
After 3xED95 cisatracurium, 3 of 21 patients exhibited haemodynamic changes >20% (2 exhibited hypotension and 1 tachycardia), while in the high-dose cisatracurium group 2 of 21 patients demonstrated a tachycardia that was predetermined to be statistically but not clinically significant.	0.7470681900310177
In the vecuronium group, 2 of 20 patients sustained statistically significant hypotension and 1 patient had statistically significant tachycardia.	0.7283717554257038
The frequency of all individual cardiovascular changes after the application of the muscle relaxant was not dose-dependent.	0.6243283449220242
After the administration of cisatracurium in two different doses (3xED95 and 5xED95) or vecuronium (3xED90) only minor cardiovascular changes were observed.	0.6014032615169668
Both drugs proved to be safe for use during induction of anaesthesia in patients ASA I-II.	0.531547867431218
With regard to its cardiovascular effects, cisatracurium shares with vecuronium the requirements of an ideal muscle relaxant.	0.48579142884365883
Between June 1993 and September 1995, 18 distal femoral fractures were treated using the supracondylar intramedullary nail.	0.5366333599642121
There were 8 type A fractures and 10 type C fractures (AO classification).	0.4871956515975355
The operative technique involved retrograde insertion of an unreamed supracondylar nail through the intercondylar notch.	0.4972806562716643
Follow-up was available on all patients and averaged 18.3 months (range 6-32 months).	0.8346651122616393
All fractures healed with an average time to union of 12.4 weeks (range 8-16 weeks).	0.8626657018344329
Bone grafting was not necessary in any case.	0.6260142017104475
Sixteen patients achieved almost the same ROM as they had had before the injury.	0.4149870179230048
One patient developed a varus malignment and underwent correction with a supracondylar osteotomy 20 months post trauma.	0.44769250726315946
There were no infections or nonunions.	0.5250803389003538
The retrograde supracondylar nail is an excellent alternative to plate osteosynthesis in the management of dia- and supracondylar femoral fractures.	0.6103962255627252
Autolyzed, antigen-extracted, allogenic (AAA) bone is an osteoinductive preparation of completely demineralized bone matrix.	0.3746184024030042
It has been clinically applied for years.	0.4562330004734801
In an experimental study in rabbits, we evaluated the influence of cortical bone and periosteum on the amount of bone formation following augmentation with AAA bone.	0.7022412252358464
Two implants of standardized size were placed on the femoral bone of rabbits.	0.52553725870146
A cell-excluding PTFE membrane was wrapped circularly around the femur as well as the anterior implant shielding the implant from the surrounding periosteum.	0.5102580891303713
The posterior implant was exposed directly to the periosteum while being shielded from the cortical bone by the membrane.	0.4343362350857559
Thus, two compartments were created selectively, preventing contact between the periosteum or cortical bone and the implants.	0.5999783820072335
For each compartment the area and volume of the induced new bone were evaluated by computerized radiograph analysis and quantitative CT (pQCT) scans.	0.489596609014975
Implantation of AAA bone led to new bone formation in both compartments.	0.5237906207270135
Contact of the periosteum and the implant led to an almost fourfold increase in bone volume.	0.581298466771328
Although bone formation showed interindividual variations, the difference of both compartments was highly significant using the Student's t-test for paired samples (P < 0.0001).	0.5347101366138339
The data show that periosteum is the primary source of new bone formation in augmentations with osteoinductive materials as it is rich in inducible progenitor cells and is well vascularized.	0.5753451677818868
In osseous augmentations with AAA bone, the periosteum should be preserved in order to achieve a close contact of the osteoinductive implant.	0.6143286178935807
Shielding from the periosteum, e.g., by cell-excluding membranes, leads to significantly less bone formation following implantation of AAA bone and should therefore be avoided.	0.6034228893578703
Computed tomography is a significant source of medical radiation exposure for populations in Europe.	0.473709892454077
Reduced radiation exposure may be possible with modern CT scanners with an image quality that while less good than before remains acceptable for clinical purposes.	0.4132281156576096
The lung appears particularly well suited to investigation with low-dose CT owing to the high contrast between normal and diseased pulmonary parenchyma.	0.6576940854617835
Undernutrition, particularly protein undernutrition, contributes to the occurrence of osteoporotic fracture, by lowering bone mass and altering muscle strength.	0.5921937313917165
Furthermore, the rate of medical complications after fracture can also be increased by nutritional deficiency.	0.6418024959667034
The IGF-I system appears to be directly involved in the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to osteoporotic hip fracture in elderly and to its complications.	0.5253072820525131
In the presence of adequate calcium and vitamin D supplies, protein supplements increasing the intakes from low to normal, raises IGF-I levels, improves the clinical outcome after hip fracture, and attenuates the decrease in proximal femur bone mineral density in the year following the fracture.	0.5409577549647995
This nutritional approach is associated with a significant reduction of the stay in rehabilitation hospital.	0.6472483317418102
This underlines the importance of nutritional supports in preventing and healing osteoporotic fractures.	0.32321356914776445
The article discusses changes in the context within which the social professions are exercised.	0.6534252256860698
The chances for a refinancing of social work and indeed its very locations change in line with the transition to new steering elements in the social body and the new implementation of competitive elements in the realm of public law.	0.4955689848074399
With the economising of the social sphere social work is questioned under economic aspects.	0.4080348229582769
Simultaneously it gains normative significance.	0.16832211839863487
This is true with regard to standards for the quality of services and institutions, and further in the context of the discussion concerning the revitalisation of local social policy for the elderly.	0.5972279920737041
Precisely the economising of the social sphere raises the question whether the municipalities may be excused from their responsibility to form, preserve and support the obligations of social work with the elderly.	0.5075318519150798
A comparison was made of the staining intensities of selected immunohistochemical proliferating antigens (p53, PCNA, Ki67), DNA flow-cytometry and ultrastructures of neoplastic cells from 120 cases of laryngeal cancers.	0.4537301995830975
Clinically very advanced tumors were in the majority (T3, 43%; T4, 18%).	0.6344356393786776
A 5-grade scale was adopted to evaluate the level of immunohistochemical staining of the carcinoma cell nuclei.	0.5564537543736534
Positive staining was obtained in 70% for p53, 57% for Ki67 and 80% for PCNA.	0.8253398011665175
Sixty-two percent of the cases were DNA-diploid and 38% DNA-aneuploid.	0.6627046868878187
The DNA-diploid carcinomas were accompanied by enlargement of the cell nuclei, preservation of wide margins of nuclear heterochromatin, enlargements of the nuclear areas and increases in the number of nuclei.	0.5461162078939847
In the aneuploid-polyploid cancers the nuclei had a substantial polymorphism, with large cleaved nuclei showing significant variations in size and having a nuclear envelope.	0.4379303543226783
A frequent finding was euchromatization of chromatin.	0.22640674483090267
Dense chromatin appeared in the form of small clumps spread over the whole area of these irregular nuclei.	0.4059348615407828
Enlargement and activation of nucleoli were found.	0.2440554985265433
The antipyretic analgesics still comprise the most widely used group of analgesic compounds.	0.33340972880426417
Until twenty years ago, aspirin, phenazone derivatives and acetaminophen had been used as standard remedies for intercurrent harmless pain conditions in connection with infections, trauma, small surgeries, but also for tension headache and other painful conditions.	0.5858081227451989
During the last decades, this group has been supplemented by a variety of 2-arylpropionic acids being primarily developed for the treatment of rheumatic pain and inflammation.	0.7074798886269904
Some of them (e.g.	0.22927830631278714
ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen) have been given over-the-counter status in some countries because of their relative safety at low doses.	0.5399530597906179
Nevertheless, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic differences among the various substances of this group make them suitable to a different degree for the treatment of pain conditions.	0.49290115626451125
A 38-year-old man presented with an intracranial extra-axial tumour at the base of the left posterior fossa which proved to be a meningeal melanocytoma.	0.6603665534222699
Meningeal melanocytoma is a rare, benign melanotic tumour of the leptomeninges occuring predominantly in the posterior fossa or the upper spinal cord in adults.	0.6398648082644551
It shows characteristic cytologic features with isomorphic epitheloid or spindle-shaped cells, often with prominent nucleoli and a variable content of intracytoplasmic melanin.	0.5017212443588869
It usually lacks signs of malignancy such as high mitotic rate, necroses or infiltrative growth and shows a low labeling index in proliferation marker studies.	0.38987779151743424
Its immunohistological profile with S-100 protein-, vimentin- and HMB-45-positive tumour cells is similar to that of (primary or metastatic) malignant melanoma.	0.7368393130257748
This differential diagnosis is crucial because of the totally different therapeutic and prognostic implications.	0.5987929702175594
Therefore, everyone dealing with surgical neuropathology should be familiar with the rare, but clinically important diagnosis of meningeal melanocytoma.	0.5387464328032552
A 54-year old, obese woman suffered from massive symmetrical swelling of the face, especially of the upper and lower eyelids.	0.7359057575831275
Initially the swelling occured intermittently, but after 2 years it was permanent and progressive markedly limiting her visual fields.	0.5319297435916283
Neither laboratory findings nor imaging procedures provided any firm evidence of an underlying cardiac, renal or endocrinological disease.	0.4753861797460835
There was no suggestion of a storage disease.	0.44393106919582626
Skin biopsy showed foam cells and granulomatous inflammation, so the patient was tentatively diagnosed as having a monosymptomatic Melkersson-Rosenthal Syndrome.	0.6116080344909979
Eyelid surgery was performed to improve her visual fields.	0.5863662211877412
Treatment with clofazimine 100 mg daily was initiated.	0.2824400052166955
Regular follow-up visits over 7 months revealed no evidence of recurrence.	0.4581215177836249
The patient died a sudden cardiac death a few months later.	0.7358893465914716
The relatives refused an autopsy.	0.1321282613231551
The definite cause of her facial swelling remains unclear as we discuss the differential diagnostic possibilities.	0.5161230064630689
An 81-year-old patient had prolonged competitive neuromuscular blockade with train-of-four ratios of 0.1 and 0.5, respectively, after two successive anaesthesia procedures (enflurane-N2O/O2; vecuronium-succinylcholine-sequence) for transurethral prostate resection.	0.6807582424490611
Although antagonism with neostigmine was promptly successful after the first, 65-min period of anaesthesia (1.5 mg vecuronium for precurarization, 100 mg succinylcholine for intubation, 3 mg vecuronium), repetitive and chronologically staggered administration of neostigmine after the second, 30-min period of anaesthesia (1 mg vecuronium for precurarization, 100 mg succinylcholine for intubation) had hardly any effect, so that the patient had to be ventilated mechanically for a total of 4.5 h. Laboratory analysis revealed homozygous, atypical, plasma cholinesterase (790 U/l; dibucaine number 23; genotype E<![CDATA[|lefbop|a<![CDATA[|clobop||opnbop|1<![CDATA[|clobop|E<![CDATA[|lefbop|a<![CDATA[|clobop||opnbop|1<![CDATA[|clobop|).	0.5456122010072687
This retrospectively confirmed a succinylcholine-induced phase II block in both instances, as had already been suspected following the second anaesthetic procedure.	0.5260035775861696
The degree of block transformation, and thus the available time, are decisive in explaining the diverse effects of antagonism here.	0.6979622132824563
It must be assumed that a complete phase II block developed after the first succinylcholine exposure owing to the longer duration of anaesthesia; the purely competitive component (train-of-four ratio 0.1) was easily antagonized by neostigmine.	0.6819051696424746
At the time of the attempted antagonism after the second, shorter period of anaesthesia, however, block transformation was still incomplete (train-of-four ratio 0.5).	0.5692624311905459
The administration of neostigmine therefore rather intensified the depolarization segment of the mixed block, so that repeated attempts at antagonism then inhibited any further block transformation.	0.44572842657192113
The Ph1-negative groups of chronic myeloproliferative diseases (CMPD) are described, and histopathological criteria that distinguish them from each other are given.	0.5714896106591396
These are based upon observations in primary biopsies from 2,331 patients with CMPDs among a total of 34,160 patients referred between 1 January 1989 and 30 June 1994 to the Bone Marrow Registry.	0.5809410283541752
These cases of CMPD break down into the main groups as follows: CML 23.2 %, megakaryocytic myelosis consistent with agnogenic myeloid metaplasia 22.3 %, essential thrombocythemia 22.1 %, and polycythemia vera 20.4 %; 12.0 % of cases were unclassifiable.	0.615136764648021
Histological progress in each group is characterized by (1) increasing number and pleomorphy of megakaryocytes, (2) increasing fibrosis, and (3) excess of blasts.	0.6682025233079508
These three features can be observed in diagnostic biopsies before any therapy.	0.5508622558050992
Therefore, it is recommended that such alterations be reported semiquantitatively.	0.6285229754816203
A staging system with four stages from 0 to 3 for each of the three features is introduced.	0.6072923323244651
Its application allows staging for the individual patient on the basis of diagnostic biop-sies.	0.46887038030279315
Chondral and osteochondral lesions as well as bone bruises of the ankle are caused in the most cases by trauma and are localized almost exclusively at the talus.	0.6211475509987969
For diagnosis, operative management and follow up, magnetic resonance imaging was useful, which can be further improved by application of intravenous or intraarticullar contrast enhancement (Gadolinium).	0.6210397659288228
In adults operative therapy is favored.	0.3155844344138788
Due to new techniques, arthroscopy became an important alternative to arthrotomy.	0.5497538372741413
According to the stage of the disease, drilling or curettage, removal or fixation of the fragment, autologous bone transplantation or osteochondral graft can be performed.	0.6226826482485771
All procedures can be managed arthroscopically.	0.47703358871188567
General Psychotherapy isn't a new type of therapy, but it could be a paradigmatic model for all empirically-oriented psychotherapists.	0.6089813119006002
The contents of this model are defined.	0.48280330727931614
Arguments and reasons are put forward as to why the practice of psychotherapy should be guided by empirically based procedure rules instead of by therapy methods.	0.3780710223312312
The procedure rules should be joined together by a theoretical conception of psychological functioning, from which their relative significance and prescription conditions can be derived.	0.4719596376853813
A consistency-theory based model of psychological functioning is sketched, from which conclusions can be drawn about the emergence and maintenance of psychological disorders on the one hand and the prescription conditions of different therapeutic procedures on the other.	0.6227796900750906
The advantages of this model in view of a general psychotherapy are discussed.	0.722602230433636
In the Federal Republic of Germany, no data existed regarding the frequency of open heart surgery for excision of cardiac neoplasms.	0.5646862092993813
Therefore, a standard questionnaire concerning heart tumors was sent to all 77 German heart centers performing cardiac surgery.	0.5347908973612283
Although induction chemotherapy administered prior to local therapy produces encouraging initial response rates in head and neck cancer, randomized studies have failed to demonstrate an improvement in survival rates.	0.5928377048405015
All randomized studies included only patients with advanced stage III and IV disease.	0.6223128997638966
In our opinion, this is the main reason for the low rate of complete responses demonstrated in the randomized trials (maximum 18%).	0.7210646650693637
estimate that a 40%-50% complete response rate is necessary before improved survival rates are seen.	0.6333127336444236
To date, such complete response rates with induction chemotherapy have only been attainable in resectable T2-T3, N0-N2 disease.	0.5471467050861647
Therefore, we initiated a prospective randomized trial including only patients with the mentioned disease stages.	0.7238125858117047
Patients (pts) were randomized to receive either induction chemotherapy with three cycles of carboplatin/5-FU prior to surgery and radiotherapy (arm A, 70 pts) or standard treatment with surgery and radiotherapy (arm B, 74 pts).	0.7512684811473707
Patients were classified according to primary tumour site and neck disease.	0.49437474383005414
The observed remission rate after chemotherapy confirmed the primary estimated rate for this subgroup of patients with head and neck cancer (CR: 43%, PR: 37%, NR: 15%, PD: 5%).	0.5589544727593305
After a follow-up of 12-96 months overall survival was 58% in arm A and 45% in arm B (n.s.).	0.8473699912228979
Disease-free survival in arm A (61%) is statistically significantly better than in arm B (43%, P=0.03).	0.733875623929794
Therefore, we recommend further controlled trials to investigate the role of induction chemotherapy in patients with primary resectable carcinomas of the oral cavity and tonsils and stage T2-T3 and N0-N2 disease prior to surgery.	0.6719598603511071
Minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass surgery has evolved as a reliable method to perform left internal mammary artery (LIMA) bypass surgery to the LAD.	0.6088291200847027
This novel technique represents a synthesis of known approaches to coronary surgery using sternotomy without extracorporeal circulation and limited access techniques in general thoracic surgery.	0.42538922607679475
Applying specially designed tools for both harvesting the internal mammary artery and mechanically stabilizing the anterior surface of the heart during anastomosis, this approach is gaining widespread acceptance.	0.6109239360157412
A steadily growing number of patients with proximal LAD lesions are submitted to cardiac surgery and the procedure is performed with increasing success rates, now approaching 98% short term patency.	0.658470957368203
In a specific series war injuries in the trochanteric region were characterized; a limited methodological approach magnified the problem.	0.5080928243398968
Our experience and the treatment results (debridement, drainage and external fixation) are presented.	0.7637318699549939
The methodology, complications and final results are also given for 15 patients.	0.5077294927203574
Consolidation was achieved in primary external fixation without additional procedures such as spongioplasty or internal fixation conversion methods.	0.46202848267690355
The time to consolidation without complications was 28.6 weeks (24-36) and with complications (deep infections, chronic osteomyelitis) 40.8 weeks (28-68).	0.7976265051130145
In total, there was one poor result with angulation, shortening of the extremity and chronic intermittent fistulation.	0.7164981907662769
The average follow-up was 22.7 months (1-34 months).	0.865548841547285
Our personal experience and the results speak on behalf of external fixation.	0.5858912845229992
Under war conditions, primary fixation ensures the best late anatomical and functional results.	0.4650274108462232
Minimal osteosynthesis improves the final outcome if the rules of application and the indications for selection are adhered to strictly.	0.46441467074505993
Introduction of the computed tomography index CTDI and the multiple scan average dose (MSAD) has led to standardization of the dose description in CT examinations.	0.5581790596736649
Despite the use of these dose parameters, many different dosages are reported in the literature for different CT methods.	0.7437791653774037
In addition, there is still a wide range of radiation dosimetry results reported for conventional CT, helical CT, and HRCT used in chest examinations.	0.6571174570308611
The variations in dosage are mainly due to differences in factors affecting the dose, i. e. beam geometry, beam quality, scanner geometry ("generation"), and operating parameters.	0.549844816239896
In addition, CT dosimetry instrumentation and methodology make a contribution to dosages.	0.4655328835368035
Recent studies calculating differences in factors affecting dosage and CT dosimetry and using similar operating parameters, show similar results in CT dosimetry for conventional and helical CT. On the other hand, dosages for HRCT were greatly reduced.	0.47662538791284825
This was mainly caused by narrow beam collimation and increasing section spacing.	0.32209366990589944
Central pulmonary embolism represents one of the most threatening complications in surgical patients.	0.6094104135975059
In most cases deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities is the source of emboli.	0.6654424380975399
Despite the introduction of hypocoagulative drugs in standard surgical concepts the incidence of deep vein thrombosis remains about 10 % in trauma patients.	0.6216257905765844
Estimated numbers of unknown cases of pulmonary embolism are supposed to be rather high too.	0.6128710944682793
In haemodynamically symptomatic pulmonary embolism events and especially when the patient has to be reanimated, mortality rates of up to 93 % are reported in literature.	0.7731560904421242

In a review of literature current concepts of treatment in central pulmonary embolism are discussed.	0.7272522498969373
Imaging of tumors of the pancreas may have a series of significant implications for surgical decision making.	0.6447592553532554
First of all verification and localization of a suspected tumor is crucial.	0.4790701129693522
Later on, accurate staging of local tumor extent and of distant metastases is necessary for evaluating the indications for surgical intervention.	0.6473514023456841
If histologic proof of malignancy of a pancreatic lesion is needed, different imaging techniques can be used for percutaneous biopsy of the tumor.	0.6545000962805786
Finally imaging is required in patients with a pancreatic tumor if an obstruction of the common bile duct is treated with palliative intent by endoscopy or transhepatic intervention.	0.6000244775603284
A rational and efficient selection from all the imaging techniques currently available requires a clear-cut definition of what is needed for surgical decision making in each individual case.	0.48844336873563937
Thereby one has to take into account whether the tumor arises from the exocrine or from the endocrine tissue of the pancreas.	0.5817449357413905
In spite of the importance of skin diseases in Africa south of the Sahara, dermatology is insufficiently represented within the established primary health care systems.	0.44730910826950093
Aim of this study was to find out whether an integrated dermatology project could reduce the prevalence of dermatoses.	0.5260459145833953
Magnetic resonance imaging has shown to be a sensitive method for diagnostics of the red bone marrow, the composition of which changes physiologically and during pathological processes.	0.7186664518347542
However, the interpretation of MRI in patients with disorders of the red bone marrow is very difficult.	0.7858453951177223
The aim of this study was the characterization of the proton spectrum of healthy bone marrow and its age- and sex-dependent changes to obtain a data basis for measurements in patients.	0.6786973080139612
We report a case of a 26-year-old patient, a tilelayer by profession, with a history of a fall from a height of 5 meters with blunt thoracic injury and resultant left atrial rupture.	0.6651878968195849
The emergency doctor found at the site of accident a deeply comatose patient (Glasgow Coma Scale 3 points) with no recordable blood pressure.	0.5777583665963341
After two hours of resuscitation at the site of accident and at the closest emergency traumatology unit a marginal blood pressure was seen.	0.5489827531838366
With a suspicion of a closed ascending aortic rupture the patient was transferred to the nearest cardiothoracic surgical unit.	0.5474910358086855
During transfer, the patient had a cardiac standstill with asystole and was further reanimated and resuscitated.	0.6738618588998583
On arrival the patient was transferred to the operation theatre immediately and after femoro-femoral cannulation was supported by a heart-lung-machine circulation.	0.6051374016552441
Through an optimal exposition the internal thoracic organs were inspected in detail and the rupture of the left atrium was identified and treated.	0.6134524949895203
