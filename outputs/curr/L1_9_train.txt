The reason is as follows: this issue concerns no less than 1 800 000 employees within the European Union.	1.1723939854103498
We already have a directive.	0.744381453132703
It is not an old one, it was issued in 1997.	1.5905924073555886
Deciding upon future policy lines, with a view to a new directive, rather hastily, without having had time to consult the trade unions or have discussions with all the social partners, I feel, runs counter to the spirit we wish to inject into the debate on matters which directly involve the social operators.	1.332755578531166
I propose, therefore, that we should keep the arrangements as per the agenda, with the debate on Friday and the vote at a later date.	1.0739769478344083
Madam President, I clearly owe Mr Wurtz an explanation, and I am going give this explanation before the whole House.	1.3335637560566236
We had reached this agreement on principle in the Conference of Presidents.	0.9197253409807231
At the time, I did not know that Commissioner Bolkestein was going to appear next week before the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism to discuss this matter.	1.185504334895705
My group has debated this matter and considers that, given the current situation of the whole process of market integration and deregulation in such a sensitive area, it is appropriate that Parliament makes an initial statement, regardless of any action it may take in the future, so that Commissioner Bolkestein may take good note and in order to guide next week' s debate.	1.3913143567716095
Madam President, I should simply like to ask Mr Wurtz to take a second look at what this is about.	1.556137712764298
It has nothing to do with any disputes on the substance; it is just about the following question: when will the Commission - having already had a year and a half to do this - finally be in a position to table the directive?	1.3185056250181308
Our sole intention in tabling the motion is to ensure that the deadlines which were promised are now finally adhered to, and it is therefore important that we act as quickly as possible.	1.1274974104917714
That is why I should like to support the Social Democrats' request to hold the vote on Friday.	1.4967575345506365
(Parliament gave its assent)	0.06492846330865369
Madam President, as you know the Cederschiöld report has been taken off Thursday' s agenda. That ought to mean that we have more time on Thursday.	1.5321912884439561
Since we will be very pressed for time in the topical and urgent debate, in view of the many matters to be addressed in an hour and a half, I simply wanted to ask whether the sessional services might not check to see whether we could have an extra half an hour for the topical and urgent debate so that there is sufficient speaking time.	1.3503253950748357
In general the way in which sittings have been managed in recent weeks seems to me to have been very chaotic.	1.2603661744440944
Last Thursday speaking times were extremely tight and then suddenly we had between one and one-and-a-half hours when there was nothing on the agenda and we had to wait for the vote.	1.0773760885388515
On Friday of this week we have one single item on the agenda.	0.9186909200035396
That is absolutely absurd.	0.5004835409786162
I really should like to ask that a review be carried out of the way in which sittings are managed.	1.3142909863335033
This sounds perfectly feasible. We shall therefore see if we can extend the urgent debate by a half hour, considering the withdrawal of Mrs Cederschiöld' s report.	1.285359565371114
This is all I am talking about here, just that.	1.4138679782693477
Madam President, I would like to talk about an item on the agenda for Wednesday, which you have not yet announced.	1.4774167858856075
I understand that there is no argument about the fact that the Council declaration, on the next sitting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, is not going to include the declaration on the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, and that this declaration has been proposed for the plenary part-session in March, so that it may be delivered in a solemn and formal way.	1.3772026565992272
I understand that there is agreement on this issue.	0.986942137291668
Madam President, this afternoon, in this Chamber, reference was made to a series of reports on the BBC Today programme this morning, which claimed that certain of my colleagues were running personal lobbying companies or somehow misusing their position as Members of this House.	1.2724559094972707
These are serious allegations.	0.6594921317879752
They are completely untrue, malicious, politically biased and were broadcast in the full knowledge of their falsehood.	0.9437641920245209
We are taking legal advice.	0.809116628849336
My colleagues' register of interests is complete.	0.7809815728396373
If we find that any Member of this House or their employees collaborated with the BBC in this farrago we will expose them to the opprobrium of this House.	1.0963683982385133
Quite, we agree absolutely.	1.633305745054324
b) Sittings of 1 and 2 March 2000 in Brussels	0.9297307934776682
Sustainable urban development - rural development - EQUAL initiative	1.0330549678268808
. (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners and members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I was given the task of drawing up the European Parliament' s report on the Community Initiative Programme INTERREG III.	1.1352674180850293
Upon referral to committee, we examined over a hundred amendments and, so far, 17 amendments, some of which have already been presented in committee, have once again been tabled.	1.4173275868222435
Before discussing the content of the resolution, I should like to inform you of the elements which I took account of and which guided my work as rapporteur.	1.1603288955077582
First of all, I would like to remind you of the function of the INTERREG Community initiative, founded on the principle of transnationality and innovation.	0.9942208084530113
This programme constitutes a driving force for development on the European scale.	0.963504747038533
INTERREG is one of the four Community initiatives scheduled for the period 2000-2006, and is the one with the largest budget for implementation, i.e. EUR 4.875 billion as opposed to EUR 3.604 billion at the present time.	1.072809527333082
The INTERREG initiative, created in 1990, is built upon the wish to make the regions of Europe ready for a 'Europe without frontiers' in the context of establishing the great single market.	1.2577425179776998
At the time of the reform of the Structural Funds in 1994 and 1996, the INTERREG CIP has incorporated new strands contributing to the development of trans-European transport and energy distribution networks.	1.2000987902996831
These programmes promoted cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation within the European Union by encouraging balanced development of the Community area.	1.050899684637213
The INTERREG III programme, for which we have before us today the guidelines issued by the European Commission, pursuant to the terms of European Community Regulation No 1260 de 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds, continues these measures.	1.1197083490617061
It is based on three strands. strand A organises cross-border cooperation between regional and local authorities in border regions, at both internal and external borders of the European Union, on the basis of joint cross-border development strategies which Member States' local and regional authorities are responsible for implementing. strand B governs transnational cooperation between national, regional and local authorities in various Member States or applicant countries regarding regional development, transport networks and the environment.	1.3234883237298867
Member States, i.e. national authorities, are responsible for implementing this strand. Finally, strand C organises interregional cooperation between different regions of the Member States or third countries to exchange experience under strands A and B and cooperate in the fields of research and technological development, subject to consultation with the European Commission which is responsible for its implementation.	1.3299912332646926
The new INTERREG programme, in the form in which we have received it, takes into consideration the needs engendered by enlargement to the countries of Eastern and Central Europe and to island regions and most remote regions.	1.391645467255137
The Commission proposes redistributing the INTERREG funding as follows: between 50 and 80% for strand A, 6% for strand C, and the remainder for strand B, i.e. from 14 up to a maximum of 44%.	1.2928808586354164
The European Commission draws up the list of eligible regions for strand A and strand B. It bases its assessment principally on the map of regions eligible during the previous programming period.	1.0334393863305251
The most remote regions may benefit from support under strand B. The Commission draws up a list of priority areas and eligible measures which for strand A is not comprehensive, but is comprehensive for strand B. The Commission reserves the option to, at a later date, put forward topics it considers important to the exchange of experience and strengthened cooperation between regions, for strand C.	1.3333469625113912
The adoption procedure for the programmes is established by the general regulations on Structural Funds.	1.1002491951340179
Proposals are drawn up by Member States and are submitted for approval to the European Commission, which checks their conformity with the general guidelines, adopted.	1.455239379976764
These proposals must include a number of elements, an overview of the cross-border or transnational priorities and strategies, a description of the measures necessary to their implementation and an indicative financial plan.	1.2581111296616354
I belong to the great majority of Members of Parliament who voted in favour of continuing the INTERREG Community Initiative Programme. I regret that Parliament was not informed about the appraisal of the previous programme, which would have enabled the new measures implemented to reach optimum efficiency, but I acknowledge that this was not an easy operation.	1.449521092511565
I also regret the fact that we had an extremely short period to work in, as the text was examined in parliamentary committee on 24 November last year and then on 26 January. I further regret the fact that neither the regions, nor the representative regional organisations were involved in framing the programme.	1.3509325700640065
In promoting cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation, this cross-disciplinary instrument is the very incarnation of a regional policy on the European scale intended to encourage harmonious and balanced development of the Community territory.	1.2224305442169627
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the conference on rural development held in Cork from 7 to 9 November 1996 set rural development as one of the European Union' s priorities since it is essential in order to maintain the existence and continued development of agriculture, to provide farmers with an environment containing the necessary infrastructure and services, and to ensure greater respect for the environment and a better quality of life, diversification and job creation.	1.1716587471777535
An integrated development policy for all rural areas in the European Union is therefore needed, consisting of the following elements: an integrated, multi-sectoral approach, simplification of administrative procedures, improvement of the partnership between European institutions and national and local actors and protection of the environment.	1.2063225960842805
In its 1998 policy paper, Agenda 2000, the Commission set out two key principles on which rural development policy should be based: the recognition of the multifunctionality of agriculture and the need for an integrated strategy for developing rural areas.	1.2580148750029643
The first principle means creating a new 'pact' between farmers and society, making the farmer 'steward of the countryside' and ensuring that society is prepared to pay for the environmental services needed to safeguard the countryside' s recreation value.	1.1310595270083157
The second principle is based on the fact that nowadays many of the job opportunities in rural areas are outside the traditional agricultural sector, so that a complete development programme which integrates rural development policies with agricultural sector policies needs to be implemented. In this way rural development is becoming a pillar of the CAP.	1.2982577692227457
The LEADER Community initiative was launched in 1991 to promote a new bottom-up approach to rural development and to diversify measures by adapting them to local needs.	0.9872298860126052
The following objectives were set: improving the development potential of rural areas by calling upon local initiative; promoting the acquisition of knowledge in the rural development sector; disseminating this knowledge to other rural areas.	0.9419577908785922
LEADER I applied to the rural areas covered by Structural Fund Objectives 1 and 5b, and 217 local action groups participated in it, with financing of EUR 1 155 million.	1.174340955809657
LEADER II (1994-1999), for which a total evaluation has, unfortunately, not yet been completed, had a wider scope than LEADER I: there were probably over 800 beneficiaries and the sums allocated, after reallocation of resources, probably amounted to over EUR 4 000 million.	1.39198765235881
In October 1999, following the success of LEADER I and LEADER II, the Commission decided to extend the initiative.	1.14855440931054
For the 2000-2006 period provision has been made, unfortunately, only for a total contribution of EUR 2 020 million, and an indicative allocation for each Member State has been set.	1.3395340281591201
LEADER+ differs from the previous stages in that all rural areas will be eligible. It is also more ambitious, and better geared to the challenges which rural areas will have to meet.	1.4082630622711398
The main changes are as follows: all rural areas will be eligible to benefit from LEADER+; the selection criteria for local measures will be more rigorous; integrated local development plans will be introduced as priority themes, such as the use of information technology, improving the quality of life, and adding value to local products.	1.1631237548879274
I therefore approve of the continuation of the initiative because, as I was saying, it emphasises the innovative development strategies and because it is more ambitious, even though there is still the need to make the criteria by which areas qualify as rural more flexible so as not to penalise rural areas with high or low population densities.	1.385772676289353
I believe the networking system to be vital for the exchange of information and skills and for the implementation of joint projects between different areas of the Union and I repeat that in order to be fully successful it must exploit inter alia measures already in existence, such as the Carrefours.	1.3228739137456047
I share the Commission' s preference for the use of global grants while urging, however, that the accounting requirements of national and regional authorities should be precisely and painstakingly defined.	1.1632172453717693
I regret the delay with which LEADER, as was the case with the other three initiatives, was presented to Parliament and for the knock-on delay this entailed for the whole procedure.	1.3315499067829235
Finally, I am concerned by the paucity of the amount allocated, if you consider, in addition, that this time the programme is available to all the countries of the Union and will be implemented for a year longer than the previous LEADER II.	1.7032137822785711
I would like to thank the Commission services for their helpfulness and cooperation, and I would like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture for the contribution they have made through their amendments.	1.3754550308791071
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, my report on EQUAL takes the form of an opinion delivered as part of the process of consultation on a new Community initiative, whose objective is to promote transnational cooperation and through it new methods of combating all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market.	1.1962635570924
The report was a major undertaking because it also incorporates opinions from four further committees - from the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, and the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.	1.0115810114835122
This Community initiative succeeds the two forerunner programmes ADAPT and EMPLOYMENT and has a much smaller budget of around EUR 2.8 billion.	0.9374778778910303
The initiative adopts a completely new approach, which is to develop innovative employment models within transnational geographical or sectoral development partnerships.	1.0828240786049552
The intention is clear: targeted projects are to be developed at transnational level, projects which are based on the employment policy guidelines of employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities.	1.0696791212956978
This objective is very much to be welcomed and also meets with a broad consensus in this House.	1.2802713876920253
In addition, EQUAL should feed into the National Action Plans for employment and its implementation should be able to be monitored through these Action Plans.	1.2373446576034843
It is an important Community initiative which, together with the three other initiatives, URBAN, LEADER and INTERREG, is financed out of the Structural Funds.	1.3349146556580698
In my report I have tried to reduce excessive administrative expenditure and to build greater openness and flexibility into the system of development partnerships.	1.1389641959003596
I consider technical support to be necessary but, given the problems with the former TAOs, no new TAOs should be set up without Parliament' s approval so as to prevent political responsibility from being passed down to the technical assistance level.	1.3524389929760843
Nevertheless, technical assistance is necessary.	1.3113045282497109
Particular attention is also paid to the dissemination of results and learning from each other by identifying best practice, with special emphasis on mainstreaming.	1.0499580745348138
I have endeavoured to secure the widest possible support for the report.	0.9422286967264787
This has meant a reduction in the number of amendments - from over 100 in committee to 22 for the plenary - which has also created numerous opportunities for compromises.	1.3030535708448618
A compromise has now also been reached on the issue of asylum seekers.	0.8348236464514337
However, in this context, Madam President, to allow us to work out the details, I should like to request that the vote on the EQUAL report be held not tomorrow but on Wednesday.	1.3686880438776998
I believe that it is important for the Community initiative to be able to begin on time and therefore for the report to receive overwhelming support so that the Commission is also obliged to take into consideration the constructive proposals made by the European Parliament, because Parliament put the appropriations for EQUAL in the reserve precisely so as to ensure that Members' ideas were also reflected in this Community initiative.	1.3840026645591446
In this connection, the European Parliament is also justified in insisting that it should be possible to amend the thematic priorities only after a further hearing in Parliament.	1.1830248677079709
EQUAL should live up to its name, and this is my firm intention.	1.2483987932065577
It should provide equal opportunities for all those at a disadvantage in the European Union.	1.0535319704607926
It should prevent society from splintering.	0.6839997386222719
It should prevent exclusion from being part of everyday life.	0.8082995781745407
Everyone should be given the opportunity to benefit here from a common initiative regardless of their age, gender or origin.	1.0383344536914307
That is my intention and I would ask the House to give this report overwhelming support!	1.5409445838049702
Madam President, it is in itself an achievement that we are having this debate on the new URBAN Community initiative and it is an achievement that I am here tonight because Air France cancelled my flight at 2.10 p.m. but I am here!	1.5517205308887745
Just a year ago when the Commission produced its proposals around Agenda 2000 it axed the URBAN initiative.	0.9972206075317359
Yet we as politicians knew that there was a groundswell of support for continuing this initiative into the year 2000.	1.0361640189531292
Parliament, therefore, can take credit for a successful lobbying campaign to put URBAN back on the agenda and get the Commission and Council to make a U-turn.	1.4125716943452968
Urban policy has always been at the forefront of EU policy.	0.7732684369894237
In my Member State, for example, we are developing a strategic approach in a White Paper and an urban government taskforce is looking at the problems of urban communities.	1.2237776034815102
With eight out of ten people in Europe living in urban areas, it is right that we help our most deprived communities to tackle the all too familiar problems of deprivation, social exclusion, joblessness, crime, drug dependency and all the problems that are associated with that.	1.2355078551450205
For example, in my own region, in Manchester, the URBAN Community initiative has been a tremendous success.	1.656616201789319
URBAN funds have been invested in one of the most deprived neighbourhoods in the UK, in Moss Side.	1.225148164725233
The Millennium Youth Park project is helping to get young people re-engaged in regenerating their own community and in addition to support for small businesses and social policy we are beginning to see a turnaround of a very deprived urban community.	1.1340273373751162
The work of this URBAN agenda was then taken out to the wider community with an active communication and publicity campaign in local supermarkets and famous British pubs.	1.0243752790007212
This is the kind of good practice we would like to see extended across the EU in terms of communication and publicity.	1.3211462480392013
As regards the specific guidelines governing the initiative, they are broadly defined to give scope for local and regional diversity.	1.0869127672915417
We agree that they ought to be indicative in nature, allowing the maximum flexibility to ensure that we target specific programmes.	1.0886170998084268
In committee we are not in favour of reducing the number to 50.	1.282449853824732
We are in favour of reduction overall but we believe that the arbitrary number of 50 is not the key factor.	1.2185750903599228
Instead, we should go for good-quality projects that can act as a catalyst to effect change and renewal, to attract inward investment in terms of loans and venture capital and to achieve a multiplier effect.	1.2144041742682052
The Member States should therefore be able to propose a reasonable number of areas within the financial ceiling of their allocations.	1.3260845448332803
In the designation of local URBAN programmes we need to make good use of local indicators and statistics on deprivation and health to enable us to more effectively target the most affected areas.	1.1270673760368186
In the UK the local index of deprivation is a very good example of a widely used standard and statistic to help determine not only EU but national and regional assistance programmes.	1.0812633858318537
This needs to be acknowledged as a tool and resource in addition to the EU criteria.	1.235381578083902
I would ask you to take on board local indicators to help us do that.	1.123105152182954
Our most deprived urban neighbourhoods face a plethora of problems: high unemployment and often very low-paid precarious employment, poverty and social exclusion.	0.9829033324091426
Often these problems are compounded by poor health and housing stock and a culture of drug dependency.	0.8347431634442575
We therefore have unstable communities which are infiltrated with crime, drug-dealing and gangs.	0.9023056328454204
This is all too familiar in many of our urban areas.	1.3120506510223726
All these complex problems undermine the quality of life for our urban residents, yet we have the potential in these areas to create growth and prosperity.	1.3340353535484777
That is why again, in my report, I have asked that action under the URBAN Programme should not merely provide a single solution to a single problem: these areas do not have single, "mono" problems.	1.5286771397682146
Instead, communities in urban areas should be encouraged to present integrated action plans to tackle their specific urban problems, using EU resources as a value added to local actions.	1.13619705222859
I would like to see those actions extended to cover health and anti-discrimination, as provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty.	1.2598116830404713
The Community initiative means community involvement.	0.9004962553027627
Some of the most active and committed proponents and agents of change in our urban areas are local residents.	1.1058844272771453
We need to encourage them to participate in designing and delivering projects for these programmes.	1.0839489796691468
The time-scale therefore proposed by the Commission is very ambitious.	1.3970929883608463
It is better to have quality projects with the active participation of community groups than to have projects delivered on time but without local participation.	1.0105327634792873
The Commission must of course provide full disclosure and transparency concerning the selection criteria used for the new urban initiatives but it must also disclose the consultancy networks which are being used to deliver the exchange of good practice.	1.2726277639960344
This is important in the interests of transparency and the overall effectiveness of networks.	1.1342163551282514
Finally, I should like to emphasise that in order to address the problems facing the post-industrial city we require local participation.	1.2147575372072632
We need to deploy the energies of the unemployed, the underused skills of youth and the experience of age to tackle these problems.	1.08140447033393
We shall thereby be able to replace poverty, dependency and alienation with equity, initiative and participation.	0.8879121859891426
This will help us to restore the credibility of the EU and the confidence of citizens that Europe can deliver local action to solve local problems.	1.2359507682311288
. (IT) Mr President, as the rapporteur, Mrs McCarthy, has already pointed out, we can certainly consider URBAN a success for the European Parliament with regard to the debate held last year on the reform of the regulations.	1.435716180432947
As we have heard, the objective of URBAN is the promotion of innovative strategies to promote economic and social regeneration in urban areas, bearing in mind that 80% of the population of Europe lives in cities.	1.203712151254836
Creating a functioning urban environment in terms of social policy requires a policy of long-term job creation, action to combat poverty, measures to assist low-income groups and old people, facilities for children, racial and ethnic integration, better opportunities for participation, a targeted public health policy including measures to prevent drug abuse and concerted crime prevention measures.	1.1778771039975595
The Communication from the Commission takes account of the need to adopt approaches combining a range of economic, social, and infrastructural measures.	1.0689928277337022
However, we must remember that, in addition to URBAN, a number of other Community instruments are also available in the social sector: innovative actions under Article 6 of the ESF regulation, pilot projects, particularly the new preparatory action for local commitment to employment that has just been introduced by the European Parliament under the 2000 budget and the EQUAL and INTERREG initiatives and mainstream ESF activities.	1.3371890654599616
As the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs stressed in its opinion, the Commission must therefore recognise the need to exploit synergies in this context while avoiding duplication of multiple funding.	1.3323410746816307
While, on the one hand, we believe that steering committees should ensure that the various projects are coherent and complementary, we would on the other hand urge the Commission to reinforce exchanges of information and coordination between the departments involved.	1.4206980895171373
Not only is this coordination essential but, as we stated in our opinion, exchanges and the dissemination of expertise and good practice must also be essential.	1.1881460534859245
Mr President, the importance of this initiative is increasing constantly as economic and social problems in Europe' s cities intensify and the public feels more and more out of touch with the administration of its city or neighbourhood.	1.1881655277682597
That situation will be compounded by social reclassifications resulting from European Union enlargement, and we must therefore make provision for the economic regeneration and social cohesion of our cities.	1.3316611622874455
Addressing those problems is all the more urgent in view of the marked spread of cities into the surrounding areas and in view of the cities' historical and cultural role.	1.1542519853911741
However, in order for such an effort to succeed it is necessary to secure the commitment and participation of the public as a whole and to enlist the support of the less active social groups and the groups particularly affected by the economic and social crisis.	1.4188541047659091
Here, we wish to stress the need for the balanced involvement of women, and the agencies that represent them, in planning and implementing the URBAN initiative programmes.	1.5213996694199208
As the Committee on Equal Opportunities, we also stress the need to finance infrastructures that will facilitate professional activity by women, mainly by harmonising their professional and family commitments, and more generally infrastructures that promote solidarity between the generations, social solidarity.	1.4098210020818527
Effective implementation of this initiative could have a cumulative result because it could inspire similar action at regional and local levels, thus increasing its political importance still further since women need to feel the effects of European policy in their day-to-day life in real terms.	1.2317511010007252
Mr President, our committee welcomed the priorities proposed by the Commission for the URBAN programme of better integration of local communities and ethnic minorities and improved security and crime prevention.	1.3484354473722706
In committee we thought that it was necessary for the economic and social regeneration of urban areas to go hand-in-hand with the creation of an atmosphere of tolerance towards minorities and therefore for measures designed to reduce racism and xenophobia to be an integral part of programmes to be funded by URBAN.	1.363096997873184
We considered that increasing public confidence by combating everyday urban crime was one of the central tasks of urban regeneration.	1.038433458803674
Our committee noted that innovative and effective action to combat and prevent crime at local level would require a whole array of measures including the incorporation of crime prevention in town planning, action to prevent juvenile delinquency, the reintegration of offenders, and models for effective local cooperation between the various parties involved, for example the police, the courts and social services.	1.247941487526395
We adopted our recommendation unanimously in the committee because we felt that it was particularly important to continue URBAN - which in the past has been implemented successfully - because, as we see it, programmes of this kind are the only way in which we in the European Union will succeed in ensuring that in the long term all those who live in the European Union enjoy peaceful coexistence.	1.5402251346936462
For this reason we very much welcome programmes of this kind.	1.1473264930080591
I should like to comment on the concerns which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has with regard to the largest of the four Community initiatives, INTERREG III.	1.2027395806285595
It must also be possible to a considerable extent for social measures to receive support under INTERREG III.	0.9885820765858697
In the light of the fact that 50% of unemployment in the Union is essentially structural and given the particular sensitivity of the situation in the border regions - I need only refer to the possibility of unwelcome migration - this is not only reasonable but imperative.	1.362379594647599
The measures eligible for funding listed in Annex II of strand A do also seem encouraging in this respect.	0.8715263670194165
In reality, however, the Commission communication does not contain a single provision for the Member States with these integrated approaches for social and employment policy aspects.	1.3097845294707273
I should therefore like to draw your attention in particular to the inclusion of increased numbers of vocational training measures, especially in areas with high levels of long-term and youth unemployment.	1.1205405167585445
Employment policy measures should also be eligible for funding under strand B, especially for the applicant countries as part of the pre-accession strategy.	1.0644333761271263
In general where the employment policy measures are concerned it would seem to me to be necessary for appointments to the joint cooperation committee to be made on a regional basis - because the local expertise required for these specific purposes is only available at regional level - so as to avoid these measures becoming too abstract and therefore proving disappointing.	1.2814031530590402
The fact that administrative expenditure on INTERREG III is - in my opinion - still excessive is something which we can and indeed always must criticise, although it almost seems to me as though this is unavoidable with the Commission' s support programmes.	1.432679881721232
However, I should like to point out that it is precisely here that this is fatal. It is precisely where employment policy is concerned that we should work towards measures which are as simplified as possible so that the social dimension of the EU is once again given the importance which it deserves.	1.4961659007250512
Mr President, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism considered, amongst other things, the report on LEADER+ and, as a result, agreed to support the process of decentralisation in the management of actions, believing that that process could be effective on two conditions: that local action groups represent the general interests of the local community, and that Commission control mechanisms are utilised to prevent local and regional political authorities from using LEADER+ resources to support civil groups and organisations which are related to those authorities.	1.2172854551574483
We ask for a guarantee that the decision-making bodies for the projects are represented equally by three elements: political representatives and public administrations, companies and economic operators, and social operators, including unions and non-governmental organisations.	1.220074357934667
We would particularly like to stress that there must be balanced representation between men and women in all of these bodies.	1.2563920448260355
We would also like to stress that the main objective is the promotion of strategies for sustainable development, whose positive effects would extend to a broader geographical area than the local community itself, and we therefore feel it is appropriate for the projects to be integrated into the development programmes, included in Objectives 1 and 2, and into the regional planning of the regions and countries in which they are located.	1.3471481272474817
We are pleased that all the rural areas of the Union may be involved in LEADER+, but we believe that it is necessary to concentrate Community resources in the less-favoured regions in order to facilitate the process of socio-economic cohesion within the Union, and that state governments should not divert these resources towards objectives other than cohesion.	1.379386274574777
The Committee believes that projects financed under action 1 should place value on the potential of endogenous development, in particular based on local traditions, techniques and practices, on specific production and on the management of sustainable energy.	1.218930880676298
The Committee supports the Commission proposal to concentrate actions in small selected areas and believes that, given the dispersed nature of many rural inhabited locations, the minimum demographic ceiling for the selection of a project should be reduced to 10 000 inhabitants.	1.2405520530724836
We believe it is necessary to coordinate the development objectives and management mechanisms of actions 2 and 3, financed by LEADER, with those of other actions financed by other Community programmes relating to interregional and international cooperation and partnership, such as INTERREG, SAPAR, PHARE, TACIS and MEDA, in the same areas.	1.2038021238691483
Mr President, Mrs Stenzel, ladies and gentlemen, before addressing the EQUAL report itself, I should like to make a point of principle in connection with the employment guidelines on which the report is based.	1.3654119790155712
The basic objectives of an EU-wide employment policy are laid down in the guidelines and include employability, entrepreneurship and adaptability.	1.1735417805851027
These objectives are obviously intended to make employees as useful and usable as possible to the economy.	0.9651766916983681
However, the aim of an approach which really sought to reduce discrimination effectively and in the long term would have to be people' s self-determination.	1.326540255380448
Only then does it stop being a question of economic usability and start being about people having equal rights to shape their own lives.	0.9519622228432205
Mrs Stenzel' s report has, however, turned out very well, at least where the prescribed guidelines are concerned.	1.38908238384654
All asylum seekers and refugees are to be included explicitly in the programmes, although this should be self-evident.	1.2396981363349167
Nevertheless the Conservatives voted against this in the committee.	1.0469338564933492
I would ask them the following questions: does your policy seek to marginalise people?	1.1080297398088523
What is the idea behind preventing people from working when they wish to do so?	1.1850551662791904
Does this not stand in stark contradiction to the guideline on employability?	0.8480004954702315
It is also worth mentioning that this is a mainstreaming programme, because there remains a shortcoming in the report.	1.4157099421470396
Particular emphasis is given to the point that women' s opportunities on the labour market ought to be improved and that to achieve this more crèches should be built.	1.1991193376421876
Anyone who lets men happily climb the career ladder and worries only about childcare places without fighting against the way in which the work of reproduction is shared out unevenly has not - and unfortunately that includes women - understood the concept of mainstreaming!	1.0700356833947042
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism adopted this opinion on the EQUAL report at its concluding discussion with no votes against and one abstention.	1.0078099410149597
I am deliberately stating this at the beginning of my intervention to make it clear that there is in fact an alternative view to that of the committee responsible, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.	1.3587552407237304
This cross-group support for the opinion is explained by the conclusions, which are devoted to the question of how issues related to regional policy, transport and tourism can be combined with action to combat all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market.	1.1674150946149393
The members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of course also identify a number of areas of the Commission proposal which they would criticise: firstly, for example, the insufficient thematic guidelines laid down for the development partnership activities; secondly, the fact that strict selection criteria for evaluating the project proposals will only be drawn up only at a later stage by the Commission and thirdly, the fear of excessive administrative and technical expenditure on project management by the Commission and the technical assistance bodies.	1.3343294984716814
That is why a ceiling needs to be set for administrative expenditure.	1.4237869943462966
The committee based its conclusions on these critical comments.	0.7554341982230787
We attached particular importance to linking the creation of new jobs for disadvantaged and excluded people in the social sector, in tourism and in small and medium-sized enterprises with promoting the establishment of new small and medium-sized businesses bearing in mind the necessary economic structural change.	1.30890985585188
Dovetailing the activities under the Community initiative with the European employment initiatives is an essential requirement and a crucial prerequisite for attaining the objectives of the EQUAL programme.	1.2729938416973334
We fully support the innovative approach towards setting up development partnerships and organising the exchange of experience at European level as an integral part of the EQUAL programme.	1.001665543090267
The specific target of deriving European added value brings the regional cooperation up to European level while retaining the cooperation of the various regional operators.	1.061345661674053
This is a good approach and that is why we have also supported it.	1.5970731070183872
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, who have managed to produce excellent reports in just a short time.	1.0254340584024253
However, criticism has been voiced within my group over the timing of the preparatory work of the committee.	1.544139772175659
The reports are late, and, in addition, they were very hastily discussed by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.	1.2227880753068563
A good opportunity to discuss the results, good practices and shortcomings of the earlier programmes was therefore lost.	1.0583239734465146
Our group is keen to stress the importance of cross-border activity under the INTERREG programme and especially cooperation focusing on areas outside the European Union.	1.0551642255640719
Such important areas include the Balkans and the Adriatic region, but, in my opinion, we should not ignore cooperation with Russia either.	1.3029459849945175
Our group would once again like to raise the issue of the practical monitoring of funds and emphasise the importance of better coordination of the INTERREG, TACIS, ISPA and PHARE programmes.	1.1923828953261377
This coordination is at present lacking, and the Commission has not as yet made any precise proposals to improve it.	1.3855548387687089
We here in Parliament are waiting for the Commission to give the committee a more detailed explanation of the issue as soon as possible.	1.1184952277865379
It is of decisive importance to get local business, organisations and other players involved in the practical implementation of programmes.	1.060116221758762
Experience shows that projects of cooperation need better planning and closer monitoring and need to be generally more successful.	0.9632650869385484
Projects have often remained half-finished, and their efficiency has been drained by administration and bureaucracy.	1.1158676190416383
We also have to demand that our partners in cooperation be committed to projects and fulfil their share of the agreement.	1.0251527317266098
Our group is reviewing a few amendments that were rejected by the committee.	1.1555631299725506
I would like to mention here again the URBAN report, in which the rapporteur, in the explanatory statements, has dealt admirably with the issue of the minimum sum of EUR 500 per inhabitant as per the Commission' s guidelines.	1.5473747655760746
It will not work as an automatic target, but must be applied in the target area according to prevailing conditions.	1.330206771349117
This is such an important matter for consideration that firm conclusions have to drawn.	1.0520095549169108
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, INTERREG is one of the most European of all the Structural Funds.	1.2275931374741977
Here, projects covering only one region or one country will not receive support; they will have to cover neighbouring regions in two or more countries.	1.207977860032058
Unfortunately this is only true for part of the money, that is only for the borders within the EU.	1.4157854691157845
But it is precisely the regions on borders with third countries which need an operational instrument to foster cross-border cooperation.	1.1291158383996451
The regulation pretends that there is one, but there is not.	1.5575407435330788
The fact is that the Commission has not amended the regulation for years, although Parliament has been calling for it to do so for some time.	1.3795865492811166
The practical consequence for these regions in the immediate future is that support for border areas will again be downgraded.	1.0092469876379784
Since 1996, Parliament has been calling for a joint fund to be created for cooperation with third countries in order to resolve difficulties.	1.2305116965748435
Nothing has happened!	0.3405212239429186
The difficulties are once again being allowed to persist, to the detriment of the regions concerned.	1.2209508070412085
Parliament is here renewing its call for an improvement and for cross-border cooperation, and we look forward to a joint fund being created and to the regulation being amended once more in cooperation with the other Commissioners.	1.2896206586681114
We want a Europe for the people and not a Europe of paper-pushers!	1.435377033242785
Mr President, a third of EU money is invested in funds for all kinds of development causes.	1.2426277018076841
According to my group, this is excellent if, as a result of this, deprivation within regions, towns and population groups is eliminated or if health and the environment improved.	1.2237518881635643
That is a question of solidarity and progress.	1.1476137776493174
But dishing out increasing amounts of money is no guarantee for improved spending.	0.9236121706385735
The local councils and regions where the money ends up have since gained practical experience.	0.8158644356466088
They find it is extremely difficult to spend the money on their most needy causes.	1.1031518787001198
Anything related to economic growth and infrastructure usually scores quite highly, but social goals and environmental causes often cannot count on approval.	1.0553078477576694
Since there is great uncertainty surrounding the way in which rules are interpreted, local councils and regions have now started to enlist the services of expensive bureaux. The task of these experts is to gauge to what extent European Commission officials would be prepared to approve plans.	1.1551448282917798
In some cases, I get the impression that it is not about solidarity or alleviating the most desperate problems, but about propaganda and upholding vested interests in exchange for the European Union' s blessing.	1.3674773329076753
It seems that the key goal there has become the construction and painting of propaganda panels advertising the fact that such and such a project has been co-financed by the European Union.	1.126664397133868
Too much money is wasted on propaganda and investigation bureaux, consultation and control, and a great deal of money ends up back in the country where it was collected in the first place.	1.2420496381716606
After the planned accession of new Member States with their 100 million inhabitants, the prosperity level of which is at one third or two thirds of the average level of the current EU Member States, this squandering will generate even more protest.	1.3097360137123222
In the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the Confederal Group of the European United Left was in agreement with the draftsman of the opinion, Mr Nogueira Román, on LEADER.	1.256212499215045
He was right to point out that it is not a good idea to share out this funding between all rural areas.	1.236791288318733
If there is a choice between investing in innovation projects or injecting most of the funding into bringing on deprived areas, we would opt for the latter as this does the most to benefit equality.	1.2053001245774595
After all, innovation in areas that have already grown prosperous is paying dividends even now and taking place without European funding.	1.0882125134620695
A second point where we need to focus our attention is the possibility of nepotism and abuse of power within regional and local councils.	1.1616674377855467
The emphasis is on local groups in which the authorities, non-profit-making organisations and profit-making companies join forces.	1.043943500752297
The discussion has centred on the allocation formula to be applied.	0.8235639477549519
In this respect, one of the variants considered is reminiscent of the Dutch polder model, the structurally planned cooperation between government, trade unions and employers' organisations.	1.1403320530542471
Let us not forget that elections for local councils and regional parliaments are held so as to represent the entire population.	1.0211478831651564
So, really, these bodies should already provide for a balance, and take into account the wishes of the union movement and environmental movement in the process.	1.369795915245891
My group welcomes the fact that the union movement and environmental movement are expressly given their own roles to play, as their input in society is important in our view.	1.3607182258114747
This could prevent local governments that are functioning in a short-sighted or insufficiently democratic way from neglecting their duty of input from the very start.	1.049301017536502
But the fact that we now fear abuse of power and nepotism indicates that, unfortunately, democracy is not fully functioning yet.	1.4032022971784184
One of the objections is that, due to the restricted role of the elected bodies, businesses gain more influence.	1.1168721299174365
As long as the economy does not weigh up the needs of all in a democratic way but is more concerned with making a profit for the benefit of a few, it is questionable as to whether democracy functions better under the rule of employers than under the rule of local councils.	1.2365360996906267
We believe in 'one man, one vote' more than 'one share, one vote' .	1.1904104561343254
Mr President, there are economic frontiers within the European Union, and the internal market with the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is fully operating at this time.	1.2486688543607205
But for the internal market to work effectively and for the single European currency to be a success it is important that all regions within Europe, of which there are over 100, can economically compete within this very challenging environment.	1.479069134212106
Some areas within the European Union are economically very strong and heavily exceed the average income per capita.	1.074521368997441
There are poor regions within the Union which need to be given European assistance to improve the fabric of their economies so that they can compete within the European Union structure.	1.3111711038607394
That is why, when we look at the EU Financial Perspective between 1989 and 1993, and 1994 and 1999, we find such a large proportion of the EU budget was put aside for the administration of the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund.	1.392876307772865
There are twin problems that still remain for many regions in Europe: firstly, the lack of adequate infrastructure in terms of road, water treatment facilities and related transport networks; secondly, the need to put in place initiatives to combat youth and long-term unemployment, which is a constant social problem in many urban and rural parts of Europe.	1.1165870188146707
There must always be a commitment to ensuring that we do not only build a Europe of the cities alone.	1.2204239358037174
We need to ensure that job creation initiatives are in place to promote employment opportunities in the small- and medium-sized enterprise sector in rural parts of Europe as well.	1.3261186640214133
The core aspects of this debate this evening relate to the operation of the EU initiative programmes, namely, the new INTERREG III initiative, EQUAL and the LEADER+ scheme.	1.3434223188328673
Between these three programmes there must be a clear demonstration of the commitment of the EU to promoting cross-border development, combating the problems of long-term unemployment and supporting rural development schemes.	1.3608594414682742
Mr President, quite a few towns and cities within the European Union have to contend with deprivation.	1.386470822246891
The Member States do not always have sufficient means at their disposal to address this deprivation adequately.	1.1065515738599534
This is why it is useful for the European Union to continue to support the Member States and, if necessary, give additional support under URBAN.	1.4609969166317653
Over the next seven years, the Commission' s proposals concerning URBAN will entail a reduction in both the Community budget and the number of areas standing to benefit.	1.3140693662471186
In common with Mrs McCarthy, I have to note that the number of areas has been drastically reduced.	1.328316048965464
It is desirable for Member States to have a certain amount of freedom to determine the number of projects themselves within the confines of a certain budget.	1.2149635634733877
As far as the budget is concerned, as already stated, URBAN is there to support and complement national policy.	1.378719124010617
In order to generate extra means if necessary, I think it is entirely logical to turn first to the Member States and private investors.	1.3024118087760552
Consequently, we cannot support Amendment No 2 of the Greens, as borne out in the committee meeting.	1.717112185534746
In addition, I am of the opinion that funding for a town or neighbourhood, especially where Community contributions are concerned, should incentivise.	1.4324508107277485
Structural support is said to cause subsidy-dependence.	0.7908338810118742
We would then be overreaching ourselves.	0.8173919476707674
I would like to finish off by making a general comment on INTERREG.	0.996207775645056
In my opinion, funding for cross-border initiatives should only be provided if it is actually required by the regions.	1.0372127926533523
When projects are implemented, it is also important that they do not contravene general Community legislation.	1.1336415597595808
According to the report issued by the Court of Auditors on the year 1998, this is not an imagined risk.	1.3964015397885141
Hence our amendment in order to prevent contradictions between general policy and actual projects.	1.0968522980476958
Before I begin I will take the liberty of expressing my consternation at the way in which Austria has been prejudged by 14 Council representatives.	1.0122971441566524
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as part of the reform of the Structural Funds the Community initiatives are being pruned to a total of four.	1.1681749884670047
I welcome the continuation of INTERREG and the priority which it has been accorded.	1.160151854831219
However, the delayed presentation of the draft guidelines has caused a number of problems.	1.435490811948243
The regions have not been sufficiently involved in the preparation of the guidelines, although this demand was often made in the debate about the reform of the Structural Funds.	1.2043150543485768
There is no direct transition between INTERREG II and III, the practical consequences of which are uncertainty in terms of planning and gaps in funding.	1.2183644159192646
That is a shame because it threatens perfectly sensible projects.	0.965888378239746
When INTERREG is implemented, it will need to be coordinated and synchronised with the other financial instruments concerned.	1.164045170284137
This is particularly important in order to increase the efficiency of the funds deployed.	1.1606058529561731
However, problems will arise in particular from the fact that under PHARE, for example, funds are managed on an annual basis and allocation of appropriations is project-related, whereas INTERREG funds are multiannual and are allocated on a measures-related basis.	1.2613614963424848
This will cause practical problems in the future, and I hope that despite this it will be possible to implement INTERREG effectively.	1.2850966400671595
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Community initiative LEADER proved itself to be an effective instrument to initiate innovative developments and pilot projects both within and outside rural areas.	1.1193456756619389
The preservation of this Community initiative in particular, in the form of a new version - LEADER+ - is therefore greatly to be welcomed.	1.4792327760220985
The new LEADER+ programme now covers all rural areas in the European Union, which will open up greater possibilities for potential projects.	1.124837761052327
It is important for there to be coordination between LEADER+ and the other support initiatives in the European Union, but coordination with other national support schemes is also just as important.	1.2804035459198764
Overlap between support schemes must be avoided and at the same time it must also be possible to exploit any synergistic effects.	1.083728719237896
In this context the aim of stepping up networking between eligible zones under LEADER is very welcome.	1.0967043138330248
Agriculture is one of the cornerstones of the rural environment and it must be possible for it to have a part in the LEADER initiative.	1.3951791222978334
In the same way, through the LEADER initiative, structural change in agriculture can be supported by creating new jobs in rural areas.	1.1058312637987056
Attention must be paid in the LEADER+ programme to all the sectors of the economy in rural areas; only a combined effort will reap an optimal result.	1.1530475201423633
LEADER must now move into the implementation phase.	0.8485495698768799
The operational programmes need to be approved as quickly as possible by the Commission, which implies practical and efficient administration of applications and completion of the application approval process as quickly as possible.	1.2867695795512435
Five months are provided for this.	0.6589826834758764
That seems to me to be rather too long.	0.9349555849863428
Efforts should be made here to achieve shorter times.	1.0127324401725475
Because anyone who develops a project and has it ready will also want to start implementing it as soon as possible.	0.9689088734161324
Despite all the delight over the reworking of this Community initiative LEADER+, I do still have one further concern.	1.2153237288864576
In its proposal the Commission called for an observatory for the LEADER+ programme without going into detail on how this proposal would be implemented.	1.0287598026234839
For me this raises the following questions: who will work there?	1.033825340565846
How will these people be selected?	0.6201009844913059
Where, above all, will the required money come from, and where should this observatory be located?	1.2760334360738657
I do think, though, that the LEADER+ programme has not got a penny to spare on additional administrative tasks, which in the normal course of events would have to be carried out by the Commission in any case.	1.399183902185154
In addition, experience from other fields where observatories have been set up shows that, apart from rather dubiously creating jobs, they are not of any great benefit.	1.2036292431228695
I would therefore call on the Commission to fulfil its monitoring duties directly itself and to do all it can to ensure that LEADER+ programmes run smoothly.	1.1934958731441956
Assessment and publication are part of this, and it has of course assumed responsibility for these in the past.	1.2257709931855605
Mr President, the majority of the borders, which have divided Europe for centuries, were artificially created, separating single geographic spaces and creating serious disparities in terms of balanced development and cohesion.	1.236136596460749
Our internal borders, or what remains of them, no longer cause wars, but they do continue to generate economic backwardness, social barriers and a lack of cultural communication between the peoples of Europe.	1.264133738266083
The Community' s institutions are obliged to work towards overcoming these border scars, which contradict the spirit of European unity.	1.2222121176058938
The economic and social cohesion which we propose is based, by means of the INTERREG initiative, on territorial cohesion and on the integration of border areas and the outermost regions of our continent.	1.266486258710174
INTERREG has always been at the heart of a genuine Community policy for regional planning and a truly polycentric notion of our European territory.	1.1176875379192264
Although the European Parliament supports this initiative, our only regret is that we have to approve a resolution on it before we have seen any evaluation of INTERREG II.	1.558019724251901
However, we are aware that we must not delay this third version further, since otherwise we would be jeopardising the success of various projects and the continuity of the projects which are currently underway. The success of INTERREG is clear and that is the opinion of the local, regional and national authorities which have participated in the cofinanced projects.	1.4510498770177718
The people who have participated in this initiative have learnt the importance of learning together, of innovation, of sharing projects and good practices and of understanding and tolerating each other.	1.2609080136444337
There are many interesting questions relating to it, the monitoring centre, the principle of concentration etc. However, I would like to concentrate on the management bodies.	1.2904526096032847
We must create joint, interregional and transnational management bodies, in which all local and regional authorities, as well as economic and social operators, play an active role.	1.3265915705816957
There must not be any repetition of cases of parallel projects on both sides of a border.	1.021910222274841
We must create a cross-border culture, and to this end we must be innovative with regard to administrative cooperation, imaginatively overcoming existing barriers and overcoming the difficulties posed by the differing levels of competence in each Member State, in each region and each municipality.	1.3070202736074994
A project must never fail to be implemented as a result of difficulties in communication.	1.2186503154383024
During debates in committee, we have also pointed out the difficulties involved in coordinating INTERREG with other annual or biannual financial instruments, such as MEDA, TACIS or PHARE.	1.2266024053850568
This Parliament' s motion for a resolution has been very attentive to these difficulties, making proposals capable of solving them to the Commission and setting reasonable deadlines for making the necessary changes.	1.2279478384732498
Mr President, my reason for wanting to contribute to this debate is because the URBAN initiative, in Ireland in particular, has been quite successful and I am keen that the European Union make a further contribution in that area.	1.6392768235687554
It is a sad fact that there are many hundreds, if not thousands, of communities in the European Union suffering very severe poverty and disadvantage.	1.5256920852392009
Even in Member States and cities that are extremely wealthy we have large numbers of people living in ghettos, in situations where there are inadequate facilities, where schooling is very poor, where the physical infrastructure is under-developed and where drugs and other phenomena are rife.	1.2683073212239004
It seems to me that in order for the European Union to demonstrate that it has a role in helping the citizens of the European Union it must give assistance to Member States to demonstrate that the Union works for these citizens and their families.	1.5106554691090823
The programme has been extremely successful in Ireland, as indeed I know it has been successful in other countries.	1.3463129193054506
It was quite slow in getting off the ground there, but it was slow because it was necessary to have the local people themselves develop these programmes.	1.3630078797501863
It is important that they use their initiative and their own local expertise in developing this initiative.	1.2049766303473812
It would be very easy to have these programmes developed quickly and on time if you brought in outside professional experts but that would undermine the whole purpose of the URBAN programme.	1.1158338182357226
I should like to make one further point before I conclude: we should insist where this money is being allocated and where this programme is being developed that it be done in the context of a serious URBAN development policy.	1.3758020055036857
This, unfortunately, is not the case in Ireland.	1.637997844112113
I applaud the innovative approach of the EQUAL programme and the aim of integrating discriminated groups into the labour market.	1.0480612785985735
The development partnerships are a very clever idea, even though they are experimental.	1.2065422874444134
I have two major concerns, however, about the development partnerships.	1.5203098932780648
They should be accessible to smaller groups, accessible for them to be able to devise, implement and monitor the programmes.	0.9290990820642484
We need to have a wide element of flexibility within the programme.	1.0134922562486897
I have also expressed concern in the past about the use of simple language and not using jargon, so that it becomes accessible to everyone.	1.2270499231134513
I am glad to see that this was accepted into the report, but I cannot agree with Amendment No 9 because that amendment really is not expressed in simple language at all.	1.171705219473931
My second concern was that some discriminated groups have specific problems, for example, disabled people' s access to the workplace.	1.0259464581764917
Projects should also specifically address this problem.	0.7435161112382495
These concerns must be looked at while setting up the programmes.	0.809392675820309
I certainly intend to do that with organisations and groups in my constituency in the West Midlands.	1.0885683725415012
I now turn to the controversial issue of asylum-seekers and refugees.	0.706456608652478
Although I am not in favour of those refugees who have been refused refugee status and threatened with repatriation, having access to EQUAL, I would support the possibility of access for all other asylum-seekers and refugees.	1.257055656834474
It is only fair and right for them to be able to access EQUAL in the same way as everyone else.	1.174983779902177
Thank you, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, with the LEADER report, rural development is very much to the fore.	1.4883459838887954
This does not happen all that often and it is gratifying, especially as the LEADER programmes have been key elements in the Union' s rural development policy.	1.2463485340660738
It must be pointed out that these programmes have not only been instrumental in structuring regional planning, but have also been vital instruments for economic and social cohesion in often vulnerable areas such as, for example, areas experiencing depopulation.	1.2250813852184863
It must be stressed that in order to become eligible under the LEADER programme, local operators have combined forces, debated and prepared projects.	1.0749665862536986
These programmes have, therefore, been important channels for participative democracy, the rationale of the citizen for Europe.	1.3176582686267093
So, the concept for LEADER+ should retain all the positive aspects of previous programmes.	1.2354061932139961
One urgent question is therefore raised: why, when this programme has been successfully run for ten years, is LEADER+ still classed as experimental?	1.3052839488286243
Are there so many other European schemes which can boast 800 specific original experiments which were particularly successful?	0.9135361116504859
For how much longer is the Commission going to leave LEADER at the experimental stage instead of bringing it online as part of the general concept of mainstreaming of rural development?	1.176328038595753
Moreover, I wonder at the reduced guidelines to which the Commission wishes to restrict LEADER+.	1.4227671350076663
At a time when, Commissioner, after Seattle, we Europeans are fighting on the grounds of multifunctionality in rural development projects, why should we confine ourselves to a few limited criteria with resources that are far from sufficient?	1.28135420919117
As an ecologist, let met tell you that the precautionary principle and sustainable development require much more diversified and many-sided approaches.	1.14373745623409
In this connection, the Commission is proposing to limit yet further the cooperation actions of local action groups to only candidate countries.	1.12692655693887
A better solution would be, as indeed the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism suggests, strengthened coordination between LEADER+ and the Community cooperation and partnership programmes, such as INTERREG, PHARE, SAPARD or MEDA.	1.0689094878210716
The fact is, showing solidarity with Eastern Europe, is all very well, but it is not enough.	1.279204106884687
The tradition which has already been established by the previous programmes with the countries of the south, particularly the countries around the Mediterranean, must not be abandoned.	1.264693096823075
Therefore, once more, we can stress that what the area of agriculture and rural development really needs is codecision. Codecision would give us effective means to progress programmes of this type, which require cooperation and cross-disciplinary application.	1.4684506268181885
Mr President, I have a few very brief comments.	1.3042231597901175
We are debating the planning phase and guidelines for the four Community initiatives without access to any substantive and complete appraisal of the previous period. This is not very good at all.	1.3466158628649039
Programmes and objectives usually turn out to be far too ambitious and their results are not always satisfactory, while the lack of transparency and complexity of the plans often allow considerable scope for mismanagement and even fraud.	1.1207917217689394
The Community initiatives we are debating could play a positive part subject to certain preconditions.	1.1948480576431302
They must, however, not be subordinated to the objectives and aspirations of a more generally negative economic and social policy, but must develop their own self-sufficient role.	1.5051196783285266
For example, adapting EQUAL to the objectives of employability and the flexibilisation of labour relations transforms this initiative into a new version of local employment contracts.	1.0223267326382433
Extending the LEADER initiative to every area in the Union entails the risk of marginalising deprived areas even more, to the benefit of more developed areas.	1.2358350796247026
The INTERREG initiative must include eligible areas with special emphasis on border areas, islands and both mountain and non-mountain areas, such as the prefecture of Arta in Greece, whose omission from Annex I of the Commission' s communication is ill-considered.	1.0495781657461434
Mr President, rural development has been identified by this Parliament and the Commission as a priority policy area, and I would like to welcome here today the Commissioner responsible, Commissioner Fischler.	1.6428736182655275
Our response to rural decline has come late in the day, but I suppose better late than never.	1.100361754471466
Family farming is now recognised as central to the European agricultural model and is an objective to be addressed, certainly within the time-scale of Agenda 2000.	1.2264835613688776
In my view the next five years will decide the future of thousands of marginal family farms.	1.3447696350301366
It behoves all of us to do everything possible to ensure their survival.	1.0500464922674044
As the Commissioner knows, farming alone will not be sufficient to ensure the sustainability of rural communities.	1.0639853009371791
For this reason we need the coordination of all policy areas capable of impacting positively on rural development.	1.1575097502682474
In this regard LEADER has established itself as an effective development initiative.	1.0954293863300884
It provides the opportunity for local communities to identify their development potential and become actively involved in addressing those problems.	1.0049424438100953
The voluntary participation of people in development programmes is something that is not always fully appreciated.	1.3503374001673474
Yet, through LEADER, there can be no doubting its effectiveness as an integral part of broader EU and national policy.	1.2320599819802283
In conclusion, while welcoming Commission approval for LEADER+, I am concerned about the time delay between the ending of LEADER II and the commencement of the new programme.	1.414143983339974
I urge you to look seriously at this problem.	0.7971451911363564
A break in continuity will have serious consequences for the programme and certainly a disruptive effect on voluntary and professional workers.	0.9602030147305438
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having read the Commission communication on the INTERREG III initiative, and pointing out that I took part in the vote on Mr Decourrière' s report within the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I should like not only to expressly reiterate our agreement in principle with the initiative as presented and, particularly in the context of INTERREG III B, with the Commission' s recognition of activities contributing to the restoration of landscapes run down due the level of prices in the agricultural sector, a sector in which many associations, especially cynegetic, are already making enormous investments in my own country.	1.2673594372876849
I should also like to give my considered support to the comments of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, particularly and primarily in deploring the failure to integrate the most remote regions into strand A of the programme or in commenting upon the lack of precision in the selection criteria for the implementation methods for strand III C and, finally, in requesting that Members of the European Parliament should be involved in the European Observatory for cross-border, transregional and interregional cooperation.	1.2724317035217085
I should further like to express major reservations with regard to the exaggerated tendency which, in the Commission communication with reference to INTERREG III and III B, involves associating environmental protection exclusively with the development of Natura 2000, which I think is often an excessively abstract means of safeguarding ecosystems, from which users are in danger of being excluded or severely restricted.	1.3277938577911528
Finally, if the Commission and the relevant Councils of Ministers permit, I should like to stress that the Members of the European Parliament should be given more information on the procedures relating to the implementation of the INTERREG projects and, beyond that, of similar initiatives.	1.5014654380602266
It would be even better if they were involved to a greater extent in the processes of framing and implementing the programmes concerned, otherwise it will be difficult to determine and defend their role in relation to the local and national authorities and even the citizens.	1.3651136167294378
Mr President, first of all, I would like thank the rapporteur of the EQUAL report, Mrs Stenzel, very warmly for all the efforts she has made to master this very complex subject matter on behalf of all of us.	1.4137977819901153
EQUAL is a very difficult programme because it attempts to combine so many old programmes and yet aims to view them in a different light, doing so with less money than was available in the previous funds.	1.1842843793929754
This is an arduous task.	1.1226890496565525
Only, the number of people affected by these programmes has not really dropped.	1.3932803278974428
This is why it is so hard to strike a balance, not only between the different countries or the different components, but especially between the different groups listed in the programme, and in fact this is what has preoccupied us to date.	1.4979025539047637
Comments are made here and there to the effect that one group should get more funding than another.	1.0901126531403542
I, for my part, have focused on the position of the handicapped and the elderly within the framework of the programme, and I have to say that their position could well have been overlooked altogether if it had not been for the European Parliament devoting special attention to them.	1.3816804979833217
Although a few other groups have been mentioned, it is the Member States, in particular, which are on the lookout.	1.4365230969103966
For example, I know of one Member State that would like to use a large proportion of the entire programme for one component, namely refugees.	1.5931772174190173
I would, therefore, ask the Commissioner to ensure that a balance is struck between these different groups.	1.1601896052413962
It should not be the case that one Member State, under the pretext of calling on the subsidiarity principle, can decide that all funding should go to one group.	1.2152720005837727
I think that this will have to be monitored closely because otherwise we will end up in that situation against which Mr Meijer has warned us so vehemently, to wit, that vested interests will emerge and that people will think that the money is theirs to spend.	1.3469819416914641
This is not the case!	0.9955072918633622
It has to be redistributed time and again.	0.6990917666841111
It should be used for innovative projects and it should not completely disappear into the Finance Minister' s treasury funds.	1.2993265603933952
That is not the intention and that is an important point that we need to bear in mind here.	1.659232875925298
I believe that the remaining problems that we have faced within this Parliament, and which in large part stem from the fact that it is so difficult to strike the right balance, can be solved.	1.4036426754614113
As far as the Commission is concerned, I hope it will be able to join in the compromise that is being concluded here in this Parliament, mainly with a view to reaching a balance.	1.4669826136070296
I would just like to underline this - the situation is, of course, a little precarious - Parliament has, for the sake of convenience and safety, placed the EQUAL programme on the back burner for the time being, so that Parliament has yet to be persuaded of the way the funds are to be distributed.	1.4361688880834096
I believe that this is actually a good thing.	1.2761744729432902
The position of Parliament in this whole procedure is somewhat unclear.	1.0866512218593158
The Rules of Procedure do not shed any more light on the matter and that is exactly why this back burner is extremely useful.	1.174095842758002
Mr President, there is no doubt that the INTERREG initiative promotes efforts to achieve economic and social cohesion in the European Union.	1.2096420047732837
However, I should like to stress INTERREG' s particular importance for the Balkan area, where political developments and hostilities over the past few years have had major economic repercussions for neighbouring countries and especially for my own country, Greece, which is the only Member State on that long-suffering peninsula.	1.3233209355943225
For Greece, for the neighbouring countries Italy and Austria, but also for Europe as a whole, the social and economic restoration of the Balkans, bringing political stability, is a vitally important matter.	1.4259630748572514
So far, some Balkan countries have received aid from the PHARE and Obnova programmes, while others have not.	1.1958094560311627
During the new programme period, in view of enlargement and bearing in mind that funding has been provided for from new financial instruments and regulations, such as ISPA and Sapard, it is considered absolutely essential to coordinate the funding of all three strands of INTERREG with other financial aid to third countries.	1.329415454413971
Accordingly, we welcome the related references in Chapter 7 of the European Commission' s proposed general guidelines for INTERREG.	1.4642076200687557
The efforts to coordinate the planning and so make it more effective must extend to all the programmes equally, and I say that because in the MEDA programme during the last period some problems arose which have to be overcome, so that we can have equal treatment for all the third countries participating in that programme.	1.3312884215823482
I should like to end by saying that the planning of the new inter-state cooperation zones has taken no account of the Mediterranean' s geographical peculiarities, which would justify the creation of a special zone for coastal and island regions.	1.416336552832112
We therefore ask the Commission to pay special attention to the issue of maritime and island cooperation when zone planning next comes up for review.	1.0355711283838023
I end by stressing the need for the European Union to persist with such initiatives, which strive to eliminate inequalities between our regions, and to foster their harmonious development.	1.4676506587470186
And since this is St. Valentine' s day, as a former Mayor of a regional city, I propose that we should all declare our love for all the European regions which need that love.	1.4657587363284927
Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, rural development can and must tackle the problem from three different angles: preservation of jobs, stewardship of the countryside and, not least, local culture, because that is of the utmost importance.	1.3888348502317904
Only if the population can stay in the countryside will the quality of life in the countryside also be permanently assured.	1.1741496055364011
We can observe the consequences of migration from the countryside in several areas of the Alps and they are devastating.	1.0389520785174555
But I warn against using these programmes to take urban culture to the countryside.	0.7824068749815967
And neither should we create structures which are reliant on subsidies and which will be dependent on them forevermore.	0.9463873500007278
To really guarantee sustainability - a buzzword which has, since it gained new currency, become relatively devoid of meaning, but we all know what we mean by it - what is needed, amongst other things, is an integrated approach in the countryside towards, for example, tourism and agriculture.	1.3963176272363018
The investment needs to be visionary.	0.6815027711711746
Young, creative individuals must be made to feel an attachment to the countryside. If they all leave then nothing much will go on there any more.	1.2237907751933603
None of us think much of the principle of indiscriminate, all-round distribution, and the pilot projects need to act, as it were, like avalanches and trigger other similar projects.	1.2662044385594364
I would be in favour of supporting self-contained cycles of projects and, even though LEADER I and LEADER II may have had shortcomings here and there, overall they were certainly positive.	1.1930353721420193
I should like to ask that we consider granting derogations not only in the Nordic countries but also for mountainous areas - the Alps, the Pyrenees and the Sierra Nevada, from where I have just returned - in respect of population size and density.	1.4753049362799031
Mr President, I want to talk about the EQUAL report, especially the issue of the policy on refugees.	1.476793534056728
Last week, we had a very impassioned discussion about the formation of the Austrian Government.	1.3331357612219774
Today, we are already discussing the Austrian coalition government' s policy on refugees because Mrs Stenzel, who is the author of the EQUAL report, of course represents Austria' s governing conservative party and its policy.	1.4159562459183535
The most startling aspect of her original report was that she wanted to limit aid to the small group of refugees covered by the Geneva Convention, that is to say so-called quota refugees or UN refugees.	1.194758989015947
In actual fact, it is the other refugees, namely those outside the quota and those not covered by UN aid, who need aid the most.	1.3478774705779841
The Committee rejected this discriminatory proposal and decided that all refugees should have a place on the EQUAL programme on identical conditions.	1.0363379512010875
Some members of the Committee, however, supported Mrs Stenzel' s proposal and wordings.	1.4617296337963623
As I see it, this means that Mr Haider' s politics are already casting their shadow over this Parliament.	1.0199504680856994
It is therefore crucially important that the Chamber should be as emphatic as it possibly can be in establishing the fact that all refugees are to have a place on the EQUAL programme.	1.3529488154792109
I want, finally, to say that I had certain misgivings last week when we discussed the formation of the Austrian Government but, when it comes to discussing and criticising its policy on refugees, I have no misgivings.	1.471166502887221
I hope that the Chamber will be just as committed this time.	1.1749112601516345
Mr President, during the last EU Financial Perspective from 1994 to 1999, when there were 13 different initiatives in operation, the INTERREG II cross-border programme was an important initiative.	1.3933398365695489
The fact that the next round of Structural Funds 2000-2006 includes the INTERREG initiative is I believe, a very clear indication of the importance which is attached to it by national EU Member States.	1.445319991671479
The INTERREG I programme between 1989 and 1993 and the INTERREG II programme between 1994 and 1999 have proved an absolute success in terms of bridging closer social and economic development between bordering Member States.	1.018101901913896
Coming from the border counties in the north-west of Ireland, I have seen over the years the important role which INTERREG I and II have played and I am delighted to welcome INTERREG III.	1.3821416238542106
The Commission is allocating 67 million pounds towards the INTERREG III programme, which will be spent on continuing the development of cross-border economic projects between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.	1.2024180180790487
The European Union has played a key role in developing the border county region in Ireland over the years.	1.2238873640325578
The European Union is the single largest contributor, with 80 million pounds to the International Fund for Ireland.	1.3836589855764914
The European Union contributes 75% of the Peace and Reconciliation programme.	1.4794714295695088
All in all, INTERREG, the International Fund for Ireland and the Peace and Reconciliation programme have all played an important role in the developing peace process.	1.231948865274473
Mr President, I am taking the floor to speak about INTERREG, but I shall confine myself to a few criticisms, which will clearly also enable me to keep to my speaking time.	1.4287964453083262
We have all spoken favourably of this programme' s confirmation and of the extension of the sectors it covers to include the field of transnational and interregional cooperation, in addition to cross-border cooperation.	1.2102955130410338
However, this does not blind us to the fact that the majority of resources - 50-80% - will be reserved for cross-border cooperation, for INTERREG IIIA. Therefore, we still think the decision to consolidate the current areas of cooperation in this strand, regarding the selection of eligible regions, is wrong and contradictory.	1.4422470152676663
We hope that the Commission will want to look into this and acknowledge Parliament' s position in practical terms, and not just with a formal tribute.	1.4181375321425327
Cross-border cooperation continues almost exclusively to be an issue concerning landlocked areas and, where exceptions have been made for maritime areas, their selection is not transparent and they often suffer from compensation from other Community policies.	1.3917434246747242
This discrimination is much more serious for islands that have a regional status that can only be linked to areas of an exclusively maritime nature.	1.0358044199146887
This is in line with ongoing discrimination, which ignores Article 158 of the Treaty on island regions with regard to cohesion policies.	1.2499941485087853
More serious still is the fact that this is occurring while ignoring the new situation associated with the approach that has been adopted towards the enlargement process for the inclusion of regions such as Malta.	1.2998244565980817
This has given rise to the proposals we are making to at least extend the regions eligible to include the NUTS III Sicilian provinces which have a frontier with Malta and to include all the regions of the Adriatic which share a frontier with Balkan regions.	1.0684899959420753
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express the satisfaction I have in noting that the most remote regions, including the French overseas departments, have received some attention in connection with the INTERREG III initiative, opening up new perspectives for their cooperation with other countries in their geographical area, even though it is true that more could have been expected, particularly with regard to access to the various strands.	1.2662571635077713
For a long time, probably a survival of our colonial heritage, our regions have fixed their attention on the European mainland, ignoring and even scorning their closest neighbours.	1.186833768903226
That time is now past.	0.7014185279049913
Our regions have become aware of belonging to an environment that they are connected to, not only in geographical terms but also in terms of their culture and the history of their peoples, hence the intensely expressed aspiration to become more deeply rooted in this environment.	1.1418365283170744
This increased awareness does not, however, affect identity alone.	1.0079492789456712
It is fostered by a fair appraisal of our assets.	0.8475698495217835
So, for example, the island of Réunion is located on a trade axis between the countries of southern Africa and those of south-east Asia.	1.1965171482144754
It cannot afford to remain outside the regional alliances being forged in this area, lest it miss out on a historic opportunity, and the same applies to our regions in the Caribbean.	1.1316776931156987
At last we are convinced that our young people may start to see an end to the tragic unemployment, the source of so much despair, if we can export to neighbouring countries the know-how which we have gained thanks to the operation of the European structural funds.	1.2501121603730663
INTERREG appropriations may be used to make our regions into veritable European Union bridgeheads into these geographical areas, giving it worldwide scope.	1.1290446528407327
I am counting on the Commission, and specifically on you, Commissioner, to allocate adequate resources for effective action.	1.4430217490659114
Mr President, Commissioners, I greatly welcome the possibilities for increased trans-European cooperation under INTERREG, but my concern is that the proposal offers fewer opportunities in this respect for maritime than for other areas.	1.3458937333511958
I understand the Commission' s own concern that distance may prove detrimental to effective cooperation.	1.062385371914288
Nonetheless, there are many maritime areas between which links are already established.	1.2569090284345776
Various local authorities around the North Sea provide a prime example of this.	0.8377753577243611
INTERREG could well allow enhancement of such cooperation.	0.6901800849145511
In consequence, I seek some small adjustments to the guidelines to provide a little more flexibility and to accommodate the ways in which the interests of maritime areas can fall between strand A and strand B. These adjustments include clarifying the possibilities for cooperation between maritime areas and permitting greater development of practical and visible projects, particularly those of an infrastructural kind.	1.2046701088937737
Such measures will put maritime and insular areas on an equal footing with other areas of the EU.	1.0344405599640922
I hope for their adoption.	0.7898164112720624
Mr President, our group welcomes the horizontal thrust of the EQUAL initiative so that, if you are a British Muslim physically disabled in some way you no longer have to chose which category of discrimination you belong to as a target group: you can use your expertise and experience to solve problems, rather than being defined as the problem.	1.2627105469586994
There is a lot of expertise within the relevant organisations which deserves to be shared.	0.9126563954517315
We also welcome the recognition of the need for evaluation and the dissemination of best practice for the tightening up of the transnational level.	0.9397278347750969
We are concerned, therefore, as others have said, at the number of amendments which seek to exclude even further some of society' s most excluded, by aiming for a very narrow definition of "refugee".	1.3165111905821167
My group will not be supporting those amendments.	0.8463292319741557
We are also concerned at the number of amendments which, in seeking to introduce greater flexibility, run the risk perhaps of obscuring responsibility for the management of the EQUAL initiative.	1.2269014896209167
Mr President, I am very pleased to see URBAN orientated towards a more integrated approach which attempts to solve interrelated problems.	1.1765720869283642
Yet, there is some risk of dilution of effort. If we pursue too many objectives, our overall effectiveness suffers.	1.525909519159426
Of course, every instance of a deprived urban area is a separate case.	1.296823514694795
But there is a common factor, a hard core, comprising unemployment, the resignation or withdrawal of public services and the disappearance of small and medium-sized enterprises, both commercial and other kinds.	1.2781473113927166
I would wish URBAN to be orientated mainly towards providing answers to those causes of urban deprivation.	0.9093465004725485
For this, of course, central policy must interact and be coordinated with development policy, so that the latter too can be reorientated and can work synergistically with the objectives of any URBAN programmes implemented in our countries, and so that it is not just using them as an alibi for its own shortcomings.	1.3482053426503313
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall confine my observations to Mr Decourrière' s report.	0.9647141780279069
The INTERREG Community Initiative Programme is an extremely important tool in terms of the development and regional planning of European territory, most particularly with reference to effectively taking into account the relationship between the centre of the European Union and its outlying regions.	1.3811564115323254
INTERREG must, therefore, be an instrument promoting territorial cohesion throughout the Union if we do not wish to see a two- or even three-speed European territory.	1.226076264625534
It is obvious to me that the regional and local authorities, and their representative bodies, the Committee of the Regions and, of course, the European Parliament should have been involved in the clearest way possible and at the earliest possible opportunity framing this programme.	1.4861307873453575
Indeed, I am forced to observe that this was not the case when the Commission drew up its communication, published on 13 October last year.	1.3759093420826514
Even though I approve of the general guidelines of INTERREG III, I feel it is extremely important to ensure better coordination between this programme, financed by the ERDF, and the other external cooperation funds, including in particular the European Development Fund, intended for ACP countries.	1.406752090404235
In this connection, I should like to thank the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for adopting one of my amendments adding the EDF to the list of these funds.	1.0287661075809953
The most remote regions, particularly the four French overseas departments, must be able to coordinate INTERREG III and the EDF in order to fund, in turn, cooperation projects with their ACP neighbours in their respective geographical areas.	1.292443271750074
Furthermore, I would ask the Commission to please reconsider the limited opportunities that have been offered to the most remote and island regions according to the guidelines put forward in the communication.	1.3474033290538125
It is essential for these regions to be able to benefit fully from INTERREG III, just like all the other regions in the Union, especially now that the REGIS programme dedicated to such isolated regions has been dropped.	1.313886850785328
Finally, in conclusion, I would like to express my regret at the low level of funding allocated to strand C, for interregional cooperation, even though the added value this offers the Community is undeniable.	1.2517581779549585
Mr President, my starting point is the EQUAL report and equality between men and women, although I must admit that it is sometimes hard to talk about this issue, which has a feeling of déjà vu about it when you are my age, in any case.	1.3639880832822808
Unfortunately, it is necessary to point out again that we do not have equality.	1.5375543683203745
A breakthrough in this regard may perhaps lead to changes in other areas, however.	1.1336345067406368
For me, equality certainly does not mean that both parties to a marriage work the whole time and hand the children over to a nanny, alias an immigrant who has not had the opportunity to obtain another job.	1.0480486859487006
If that is the case, we have not progressed one little bit since pagan times.	1.3289742733265113
No, equality means that we all participate in both working life and family life.	1.302340604545567
Unfortunately, developments are not moving in that direction.	1.115873937895712
On the contrary.	0.7463588595757702
I think, therefore, that paragraph 7 contains something very central, i.e. that EQUAL will be used as a testing ground for developing and promoting new ways of delivering employment policies.	1.159355321545899
One can only hope that it succeeds.	0.9686605730068343
I should just like to say, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, that if I am not here when the Commission responds - not that I have asked any specific questions, but I should nonetheless hope that the Commission has been paying attention - then that is because the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities is meeting to discuss women in the decision-making process at the same time as the present debate is going on.	1.448990185766199
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, those who work on rural areas know that, of the programmes which the European Union has managed, the LEADER programme, both LEADER I and LEADER II, is one of its success stories, and I hope that the same will be true of LEADER+.	1.5497739967867141
One of the reasons why it has been so successful is that the basic concept of the LEADER programmes aroused substantial interest in activities amongst the population concerned.	1.2646765968153366
I am glad that LEADER+ is to remain true to this underlying concept.	1.0066052814177522
There is a problem, however, which we need to address together.	1.6822781970183114
Because LEADER is a kind of workshop with a bottom-up approach, a huge number of ideas have come to fruition in recent years through LEADER I and II which of course at some point will no longer be brand new or as successful as they once were.	1.124308085690308
And because of the programme' s success and its basic approach they will of course at some point then be dropped from LEADER.	0.9644478875645113
That is why, where the good LEADER projects are concerned, we need to ensure that those which have proved to be outstanding are not suddenly discontinued; instead the ideas which have proved to be worthwhile need at some stage to be transferred into the standard programmes as a reliable, positive component of our support to rural areas.	1.205308506556119
Of course this is also the basic idea.	1.1918181554614213
It is to take new ideas and try them out in LEADER, with the participants on the ground, with the local organisations on the ground, with many non-governmental organisations, with the churches, with all those who have helped actually to get new ideas up and running in rural communities.	1.3661918419485042
Here we must ensure that the good schemes, those which are really excellent, are then somehow transferred into rural development policy to safeguard the future of this laudable work.	1.3371058586649018
My request to the Commission is that it should make sure that the organisations and sections of the population which get involved really are accepted.	1.5818080658007507
There should be no attempt to have one or other organisation, which is just being formed with a view to contributing a new idea and is not yet so well known, pushed a little on to the sidelines, say because of official local or regional policy.	1.3179528151554205
Have faith in the successful results which LEADER has had so far.	0.8531779841782122
At the beginning it is sometimes a little like chasing a rainbow if we say that a plan is too idealistic.	1.2420234425761039
And then when the work and the action start something emerges which the official policy, including ourselves at this level, could never have imagined would suddenly have developed so well.	1.2775607421907733
That was the charm of LEADER, and that should please not be lost!	1.2619225884536787
Mr President, I welcome the EQUAL initiative and the report which highlights the need to distinguish between actions to combat discrimination against women and actions to combat discrimination against minority groups.	1.2878701111431252
Women are not a minority and often suffer double discrimination as members of minority groups as well as because of their gender.	1.1502486461097157
This is why specific action for women is needed, as well as mainstreaming.	1.2692257331848549
The report addresses this and proposes integrating action to achieve equality between women and men in all aspects of work; it also recognises the importance of working with local and regional bodies which are those closest to the people to help ensure that all project results are mainstreamed.	1.1876424951500966
The involvement of voluntary and community groups will also be an essential ingredient of the EQUAL initiative and the projects.	1.1066206511021843
The development partnerships within the thematic fields, which are referred to in Amendment No. 22, would enable even the smaller organisations to play a part in the EQUAL initiative.	1.30857217686729
My group will be supporting Amendment No. 22.	1.0929043590043894
Mr President, the report under discussion in the House today is doubtless of great importance.	1.4062513320878107
In addition to the objectives it is working towards, the strong point of the Community initiative INTERREG for the 2000-2006 programming period lies in its added value from the viewpoint of what is now the imminent enlargement of the European Union to include new Eastern European and Mediterranean countries.	1.4192539652081326
In my opinion, it is precisely in anticipation of this deadline that the European Union should strive to reduce disparities between regions and put an end to the isolation of border areas.	1.2630784184037276
Indeed, these areas - and it is right to stress this - have an important role to play as an interface with the applicant countries that are going to join the Union.	1.376223030894786
It is precisely with this in mind that I tabled some amendments which I consider to be of the utmost importance, and that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has subsequently taken up.	1.298430313223867
They call for the areas eligible for cross-border cooperation to be extended to all regions of the Adriatic, as well as to the Sicilian provinces which have a frontier with Malta - an applicant country - which, inexplicably, are not currently included in strand A, Annex 1.	1.2544218894851111
I am confident that Commissioner Barnier and the President of the European Commission will duly consider Parliament' s position on the matter, in accordance with the Code of Conduct.	1.3729067371505326
There are fundamental advantages for the whole of Europe for it to promote cooperation with the applicant countries and to support border regions.	1.2460059711273788
Finally, it is to be hoped that greater coordination will be sought between the INTERREG initiative and the existing Community programmes, which are significant for external policy, as a vector for greater integration and for the joint drafting of programmes.	1.530523048495644
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, LEADER I was an outright success due, in particular, to the great flexibility of the administrative management between the Commission and the local operators.	1.4067380070329445
It is, I think, regrettable that the Commission could not make a similar assessment of LEADER II, regarding the quality of the projects, the quantity of appropriations spent and, most especially, the demotivation of some local operators in the face of the administrative and financial unwieldiness they encountered.	1.3485383172850545
I am pleased to see, however, that under LEADER+, new resources have been allocated to helping rural territories to develop their potential and to implement the objectives of local and sustainable development.	1.2906832672403095
I feel it is important to put special emphasis on trying out new ways to raise the profile of the natural and cultural heritage and to strengthen the economic environment, in order to promote employment.	1.2530855969837382
The time is now right, I think, to consider including the exchange of positive development experience in the scope of transnational cooperation.	1.363979635736993
It is interesting to note that all rural areas may be eligible for LEADER II.	0.7947854699556282
Nonetheless, if the opportunity for Member States to determine the areas, within the scope of this initiative, remains available, then the Commission will have to ensure a certain focusing of resources and prioritise projects in the less prosperous areas.	1.4912413521742798
There must, of course, be transparency regarding the selection criteria for projects and local action groups.	1.0184193257507146
I also feel there are grounds for ensuring, in particular, that the financial channels of States or local authorities are not behind the delays in payment which may have caused some LAGs to become bankrupt under LEADER II.	1.2559969387627474
Mr President, as a Member from one of the outermost regions, I must point out that this is a very special afternoon as far as regional policy is concerned, because of the debate on two Community initiatives, URBAN and INTERREG.	1.5186004732526381
I would like to remind you that these initiatives are aimed, firstly, in the case of URBAN, at improving the quality of life of the citizens who live in the poorer parts of various European cities, and, in the case of INTERREG, at facilitating cohesion and recognising the diversity and potential of the regions of the European Union, particularly by including the outermost regions in strands B and C.	1.4134156474216166
Like the rapporteur, we deplore the fact that it has been excluded from strand IIIA.	1.3917025673456602
With regard to INTERREG, we are very happy that there is a reference to the creation of a European monitoring centre concerned with cooperation.	1.4105001083585293
I would like to thank the rapporteurs, particularly Mr Decourrière, for his sensitivity towards the regions and for accepting our amendments.	1.355847853569966
I hope that the Commissioner will accept the proposal which we are making.	1.5323754575356052
Mr President, with regard to the various initiatives which we are analysing this afternoon, I would like to concentrate strictly on one of them, that is, the URBAN programme.	1.4462474243480068
It is a fact that we are debating this programme today because the European Parliament insisted that this initiative should be maintained.	1.4553744504819242
The Commission proposed removing it and other initiatives, but Parliament' s proposal and the sensitivity of the Commission itself at the time led to the URBAN initiative being retained.	1.6175354742351578
I believe that we should be pleased about this.	1.1516617917123266
But what were the Commission' s arguments, from Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies and Director-General Eneko Landaburu in particular, for eliminating the URBAN programme?	1.283907386253243
Its argument was one of priority.	0.6334841251545894
The urban question is so important that we cannot tighten our belts and undervalue it with a programme which has such a small budget.	1.1799214410048235
Today the programme is in place and therefore I believe we have achieved something important, that distinguishing mark of the European Union called the URBAN programme.	1.482110676453591
However, I would like to address Commissioner Barnier and support the argument of Commissioner Wulf-Mathies and the Director-General, because I think they were absolutely right.	1.3722916750185348
The urban dimension must be incorporated much more deeply in all the structural funds.	1.0262117487111546
The amount of budget required by our cities - where 80% of the European population live and which increasingly represent both the best and the worst of what we have in Europe, I believe, clearly indicates that the European dimension should be taken into account and that this URBAN programme should not be used as an excuse not to analyse in detail, not to prioritise and, therefore, not to introduce an infinitely greater budgetary contribution into programmes which affect the cities, by means of European funds.	1.4404083626993993
Therefore, I do not believe I need to restate the number of factors which demand this investment in urban areas, factors which are on the agenda, and I would like to say to the Commissioner that we hope he will be sensitive in this respect.	1.281550713917704
In welcoming the cross-sectoral approach embodied in the new EQUAL initiative, it is crucial that the programme addresses the distinct forms of discrimination which militate against disabled people in particular: physical barriers in the workplace affecting those with limited mobility, visual information systems which exclude blind workers, working systems which effectively close the door on people with learning difficulties or with mental health problems.	1.073569309539824
Organisations of disabled people and disabled people' s non-disabled representatives must have a proper interest at every stage of decision-making.	0.9663454717495217
That is why this Parliament has put forward paragraphs 10 and 15 of the resolution, to ensure that Member States cannot ignore any one target group.	1.2457268964622736
Disabled people have too often been left off the list.	0.8222864244624031
Because disabled people do not form one homogenous group - for example many deaf people see themselves as a linguistic minority denied respect for their own language and culture - it is necessary as stated in paragraph 9 to enable some partnerships to be defined which are specific to a particular disability or other group.	1.2500509498950754
EQUAL remains crucial also to regions like my own, in the east of England, outside the principal funds of Objective I. We have had an extra incentive to take up Community initiative funding and an excellent record in response.	1.3342593055980498
Former ADAPT projects range from the CORE project, which has developed new supply chains for the car industry in Bedfordshire, to projects to raise standards in small businesses in Hertfordshire in Essex.	1.216359156661338
We have seen the NOW project helping 70 women to return to work in Suffolk, many of whom were able to come and share the results of their experience directly with us at the European Parliament in Brussels.	1.3092448574283289
EQUAL remains important to us because it is precisely in relatively more prosperous regions that lower-skilled jobs are being shed, which can be an important first destination for those discriminated against in the labour market.	1.102016255127656
Finally, a word on INTERREG.	1.5278208995097122
It really is quite nonsensical that partnerships set up in 1994 are being rolled over now to the exclusion of new inter-regional links.	0.957620551632683
During this period the ports of Great Yarmouth and Harwich on the Essex-Suffolk-Norfolk coast have launched significant new transportation and economic links with partners in the Netherlands.	0.8384756688590839
I urge Parliament to support our Amendment No 2, which would ensure flexibility so as to include new areas, particularly on maritime borders.	1.4635453756237957
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for the information of the House, Mr President, I should like to make a clarification.	1.2076306215506287
Chancellor Schüssel' s government will maintain the refugee policy of the former social democratic government led by Chancellor Klima.	1.1310021322946402
There is no change in refugee policy in Austria!	1.0808767614513348
Rural areas make up over 80% of the EU' s territory and 25% of the population live in them.	1.299217962705629
As a farmer and Member of Parliament, I have always endeavoured not to look at agriculture in isolation but to see rural areas as a whole.	1.2583074221251846
I attach particular importance to adopting an integrated approach towards rural development because I am convinced that only cooperation linking up all people from all walks of life in rural areas will permit them to be active and attractive places to live for everyone; I refer, in short, to the multifunctionality of rural areas.	1.2565529988969824
I should like to welcome in particular the new LEADER+ programme because of its comprehensive nature.	1.3706913499816804
In the future it will be possible to have programmes not only in the individual zones eligible for structural aid but in all the regions of the EU.	1.2795959677523163
This across-the-board approach is sensible because the programmes for rural development are also structured in this way.	1.1503340594415474
In the future, funding will no longer come from three funds but from the EAGGF Guidance section alone.	1.085643826247674
It will therefore be necessary to increase the quality of the programmes because the EAGGF is supposed to be an effective financial instrument.	1.2159200835597452
Greater precision in the selection process will lead to greater effectiveness, because the money should not be squandered recklessly.	1.1773622119436755
In addition, I should particularly like to emphasise the point which offers an approach towards creating an integrated and environmentally friendly development strategy.	1.3104865620148423
There is great potential for future job creation in rural areas here and we must exploit this if we wish to offer fresh prospects to people living in the countryside.	1.1364772645996808
That is why policy for rural areas is more than a policy just for farmers.	1.3869860023485483
LEADER+ should supplement already existing programmes, avoid overlaps and duplication of financing and thus contribute to a process of development which is as comprehensive as possible.	0.9164306907843904
In this way, LEADER+ can, together with the programmes under Regulation (EC) No 1257/99, consolidate the second pillar of the CAP even more effectively and produce the best possible benefits for the whole of the countryside.	1.0623733919830631
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am not always proud of the fuss that goes on here in Parliament, but the URBAN programme is one of the best examples of our work: it was created following an initiative in Parliament.	1.4068776536749426
The Commission would have abolished URBAN, but this time Parliament drew the longer straw.	1.3616248609637682
It is good that URBAN is to continue, as it has had good results at local level.	1.3092549477892714
The problems in Europe' s urban areas are getting worse; fortunately, we now have consensus with the Commission.	1.2014432996857896
The majority of the population of Europe live in cities, and their problems are among the most pressing within the context of regional policy and very complex matters in themselves.	1.3234588095192052
There is an immense risk of exclusion.	0.9880427055209613
In many cities in France and England there are now slums, breeding grounds for many sorts of problems.	0.9632006667608808
None of us wants South American type favelas in Europe.	0.705726082219865
We have to act now, before it is too late.	1.3962192410399474
Our cities are also of decisive importance for Europe' s economy.	0.9986336460289332
We always come back to the same basic problem in Europe: our economy does not support the individual sufficiently, nor is it sufficiently dynamic.	1.193330536293406
The economy has to be strong for us to be able to attend to the problems of our fellow-citizens and our environment.	1.2682615846637821
This is not policy; it is life' s simple logic.	1.410177104825054
It is good that spending has become focused, as otherwise the buckshot gets scattered to the four winds.	1.1853098686796666
Now we have to concentrate on solving problems in small and middle-size towns and cities, as they do not have enough resources.	1.2870194400615578
In this way we will also be able to speed up matters in surrounding rural areas; it is often forgotten that urban and rural problems in fact go hand in hand.	1.182105629914167
The basis for all this is that we should be encouraging individual innovation and entrepreneurship, as group action begun by the individual will help revitalise an area internally.	1.3718835133609333
Granting funds without an economy that can stand on its own two feet is like carrying water to fill up a dry well: there will be enough to drink for a while, but tomorrow the well will be dry again.	1.1418984794238796
Mr President, with the implementation of INTERREG III, European cooperation policy is entering a new phase.	1.447095137901382
Our attention is no longer focused exclusively on internal borders but also on external ones.	1.1065642613013589
In the context of globalisation and cultural openness which characterise the current situation, the European Union needs instruments that will allow it to strengthen its links and communication channels with neighbouring regions, particularly in Eastern and Southern Europe.	1.308316070323735
The Union' s borders must no longer be an obstacle to balanced development, but - on the contrary - an opportunity, a bridge to more fruitful cooperation.	1.5008973077962577
By means of amendments adopted in committee, Parliament has tried to supplement the Commission' s work, by including new elements in the list of areas targeted for aid, and in particular external border areas and maritime border areas in Southern Europe.	1.2489076305359954
In its draft guidelines, the Commission acknowledges that these borders require greater attention than they did in the past.	1.277712214614671
This is on account of the process of enlargement to the east and that of greater integration with the Mediterranean countries.	1.2558480767696887
As President Prodi too mentioned when outlining the strategic objectives for the period 2000-2005, boosting the Barcelona process is a priority for the Union, and the INTERREG III initiative will be able to make its contribution to the pursuit of this strategic objective.	1.2342458000707222
In congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent work, we can but hope that the Commission will duly take into consideration the proposals Parliament has put forward, in accordance with the commitments made under the Code of Conduct on the implementation of structural policies, and that it will confirm, with fitting amendments, the transformation of this Community initiative from a mere instrument for internal redistribution to an opportunity to boost and enhance relations with neighbouring countries.	1.3906434581902585
Mr President, from this year until the year 2006 around EUR 200 billion is available for the Structural Funds, but only 5¾ % is set aside for the Community initiatives, INTERREG, LEADER, URBAN and EQUAL.	1.3861655392539411
That is a reduction of 3¾ % compared with the previous CIs.	1.1420619460096975
No more than EUR 2.8 billion is provided for EQUAL, as Mrs Stenzel' s balanced report makes clear.	1.2348809608748093
This makes the large number of amendments and far too long a wish list of possible tasks all the more astonishing.	1.2515185954250543
How are priorities supposed to be set here?	1.0188226736525934
There is agreement on the principle that marginalisation, discrimination and inequalities on the labour market should be reduced.	1.252429133589965
Transnational strategies are intended to make it possible for disadvantaged groups to have access to jobs.	0.9465712353035152
I have no sympathy for amendments once again backing the TAOs. Criticism of the previous Commission' s work was particularly severe, legitimately so, with regard to these Technical Assistance Offices.	1.2642408017465645
Our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was, after all, in overall charge of analysing considerable shortcomings and failures to carry out checks in cases related to LEONARDO.	1.0899607862176064
The Commission cannot therefore be relieved of direct responsibility or the task of carrying out inspections under EQUAL either.	1.085145289319575
It can only approve Member States' proposals if they fulfil all the criteria: firstly, integration through sectoral and geographical development partnerships, whereby the employment policy guidelines need to be taken into account; secondly, the systematic involvement of the operators concerned - the local, regional and national authorities, training institutions, universities, NGOs, the two sides of industry and the private sector - with the aim of creating a durable partnership, and thirdly, methods and models of indisputably innovative character.	1.2939046771688072
The Commission must therefore be the guarantor of the strategic framework for promoting ability to work and quality of work, of the assessment of results and of the effective communication of best practices.	1.270398432333875
Only then will it be possible for the desired multiplier effect to be achieved.	0.9775536539460153
Mr President, I want to refer to the Commission proposals on the budget line to promote the CAP.	1.4160752827250602
On 26 October 1999 the European Commission adopted a proposal to ensure that a legal basis is given to the budget line informing the public about the CAP.	1.3329226884129484
This proposal will remove the current budget line B2-5122 and create a new budget heading B1-382.	0.9296312399528226
Actions which promote understanding between young farmers and the EU and also create stronger links with EU candidate countries and the outside world are important.	1.1470812345777737
Therefore I am putting forward these amendments to Parliament to give its support to the contributions of this type of programme.	1.120971553602419
Given the need to encourage young farmers to continue in farming it is vitally important that they are well-informed about developments in the common agricultural policy.	1.1668725377530746
Informing and training young farmers at European level is vitally important.	0.854436358470083
I would ask you to support that part of the available budget should be concentrated on the development of knowledge amongst European young farmers.	1.0178698688775614
Regarding information and training, in the past this budget line has been allocated for information, communication and training.	1.278172680868355
But the Commission is now proposing that training should no longer be included.	1.4099300781082473
I feel that training should be included where it provides relevant information at European level about the CAP.	1.0513323479193348
Such European training is one element in ensuring that young farmers have the necessary knowledge of the CAP to make sound business decisions for the future.	1.0285006385498012
Therefore I am putting forward three amendments.	0.5946846373261883
I would urge Parliament to support them.	1.0576573368106312
Mr President, I am taking the floor to express my opinion, drawn from my experience of municipal administration, that the URBAN projects should, or rather must, have a threefold purpose: firstly, to promote the restoration of infrastructure and historic, old and perhaps dilapidated areas of cities.	1.4286402244435814
Secondly, to promote and stimulate economic activity and social life within these historic centres, within these old quarters of our cities.	1.3903656623652325
There is little point in having streets which are now wonderfully lit, with new pavements, with newly paved road surfaces, all whitewashed and beautiful, if we are not able to fill them with activity and, therefore, employment.	1.386672735703079
I would like to make it clear that it is not just a question of finance or aid to the different social operators, but rather also of selecting those projects which are aimed at employment, or to put it another way, projects which will tend to favour the creation and promotion of jobs.	1.3316425250778015
Thirdly - and perhaps this should be the first objective - the projects should principally be aimed at the complete rehabilitation of people and families, because man is not made for the law, but rather law is made for man.	1.5970004343869075
These areas of our cities are often home to single-parent families, elderly people who receive a pension and no longer carry out productive activity, and families facing difficulties; sometimes they are families which have broken down and which are excluded from mainstream society.	1.1106107514408121
These people live in areas which should benefit from these projects.	0.9745891709097495
If we have success in this threefold sense, I believe that these families, these people, these European citizens, will believe more in Europe, and this seems to me to be very important because, ultimately, the cities will increasingly come to play a leading role in European life.	1.5076391976739427
. (FR) Mr President, before my friends and fellow Commissioners, Franz Fischler and Anna Diamantopoulou, in turn come to speak - since all three of us who are responsible for these four Community initiatives have had the opportunity to follow this debate with the same interest, I would like to endeavour to speak on the subject of URBAN and INTERREG, which many of you have brought up and discussed.	1.3885431325692583
Straight away I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteurs from the committees, from all the committees, but also to the speakers for the groups and to each and every one of you for the quality of your speeches and the great interest they express with regard to these two initiatives.	1.3388745309490706
This is particularly true of what Mrs McCarthy said about URBAN. I should like to thank her not only for her work and for the report which she presented but also - and I do not see why I in turn should not say so too - for all we owe her, for all you owe her as far as this is initiative, as well as, more generally, all we owe Parliament.	1.497887767447838
I am mindful of the fact that it was in fact the European Parliament which made the political decision and supported the continuation of this initiative for the regeneration of urban areas in difficulties, in favour of sustainable urban development, involving at the same time this integrated approach, which we value, to handle the economic, social and environmental aspects simultaneously.	1.4964239052135377
Some other points of agreement highlighted in Mrs McCarthy' s report, the effectiveness of this instrument through the concentration of funding and a critical mass for intervention, the horizontal operation which we think more conducive to disseminating results and increasing the exchange of experience and good practice and, finally, the increasing role of local authorities in the planning and management of the programmes, on the basis of a real partnership.	1.2972913287801449
Having mentioned the fundamental points of agreement between the Commission' s proposals and Parliament and, having stressed my great interest in hearing the various contributions, I should like to answer a few of the criticisms and a few of the suggestions which have been made, with apologies if I cannot attribute each of the questions to the speakers by name.	1.4255119702406394
I think however that you will all recognise your own comments.	0.9844452128974566
Firstly on the subject of the URBAN programme and the maximum threshold of fifty towns, which a number of you termed arbitrary.	1.2226201884109416
I can understand your concern.	0.8470393173544591
I have therefore asked my services to be willing to consider a reasonable increase in the number of towns eligible under the URBAN programme conditional upon certain guarantees, firstly on concentration - I am thinking particularly of the target areas which must have a minimum of 20 000 or, in exceptional cases, 10 000 inhabitants - and also upon the critical mass of funding: we must keep to EUR 500 per inhabitant so that the European Union action may be both effective and clear, and so that it does not resemble a sort of scattering of resources which would have no real impact either for citizens or for municipalities.	1.3961747095512396
That is my initial response to the threshold question.	1.0200195929531204
Regarding a second matter, now, relating to the additional criteria, which should be taken into consideration in selecting disadvantaged areas. Here, too, I am willing to demonstrate greater flexibility and to consider other relevant criteria in addition to the Community criteria given in point 11 of the guidance project.	1.33552438509218
Third point: specific measures in favour of some social groups - some speakers mentioned them - women, but also immigrants and refugees, must be envisaged.	1.294193079118015
This concern, ladies and gentlemen, lies at the very heart of our URBAN initiative, and I am willing to rewrite the text, if necessary, in order to make this message clearer yet.	1.2184725899493
Regarding URBAN, I should like to conclude with the implementation procedure and mention, first of all, the selection procedure.	1.214498588557968
Some speakers wanted it to be less bureaucratic, more transparent, and to avoid redundancy in terms of the projects and funding.	1.5613814968440438
Ladies and gentlemen, on this point we must make it clear: in the context of subsidiarity, the selection of zones or municipalities eligible for URBAN is primarily the responsibility of the Member States.	1.5065989589522255
As far as the Commission is concerned, it is willing to avoid any unjustified bureaucratic overload, but we cannot give up the practice of checking the relevance and quality of the proposed programmes, indeed you would be the first to criticise us if we did.	1.5309416310450215
A second observation, the time limits for the submission of programmes and the possibility of submitting a planning supplement in addition to the programmes.	1.185924415136077
I have no objection to the idea of submitting a planning supplement jointly with the main programme.	0.9082571320802768
This cannot, however, be grounds for an extension of the original time limit.	1.2782296035067182
Let me remind you that the time limit for this programme is six months.	1.0508631564560218
This time limit, which indeed is identical to the one we granted for INTERREG and for the Objective 2 DOCUPs, should normally be adequate, I feel, for drawing up a programme, which does not mean that the projects cannot be defined at a later stage.	1.443434661884058
With regard to URBAN, I should like to conclude with a final observation.	1.0510760391361502
One of you expressed a wish that these urban issues should not be confined to the URBAN initiative.	1.0094946664556432
I agree completely.	0.34648918224977204
I myself expressed my concern at the meeting of Ministers for regional and urban planning, a concern to which I devote myself, that in the DOCUPs and the CSFs in the planning which we are currently starting to negotiate, my concern, as I said, that, apart from the URBAN initiative, urban issues should be addressed in all the Objective 1 and Objective 2 programmes, and I believe I can express both our awareness of such issues and also our commitment to include them, beyond the scope of URBAN, in all structural fund programming.	1.4432713121460743
But, as for the future, since we must look ahead, I am extremely concerned to see how URBAN is going to be implemented in practical terms, and also to see what our experience will be and what lessons we can learn, because plainly these urban issues are going to be the focus of what may be, for future financial perspectives, a new European regional planning policy.	1.7053445614173526
I am not forgetting, and we cannot forget, that 80% of the citizens of Europe today live in towns and that is why this URBAN instrument is extremely important.	1.6158592803598024
Let me repeat what I have said, we shall be most attentive to the inclusion of urban issues in all structural fund programming.	1.0765967375386685
I should now, Mr President, like to bring up the subject of INTERREG and to thank the rapporteur, Francis Decourrière, in the same way that I thanked Arlene McCarthy, for the quality and relevance of his work.	1.5213511481654123
He stressed a number of points, with which we may indicate our agreement, as many of you did too - the importance of this trans-European cooperation, with its three strands, cross-border, transnational, interregional; the added value to the Community provided by INTERREG, its clarity in relation to the general framework of the structural funds, and the truly cross-border and transnational strengthening of eligible programmes and operations; the importance of common structures and what, in discussing another debate which begins today, the Intergovernmental Conference, I termed the common European spirit which we have to strengthen, and here, with INTERREG, thanks to INTERREG, is a way to strengthen common spirit through common structures for the implementation of programmes with real financial solidarity; the importance of partnership in guaranteeing the active participation of all the local and regional authorities concerned as well as private sector associations and economic and social partners.	1.452022198325127
Having made these general observations, I should like to focus on your main comments with regard to INTERREG.	1.0205677328281622
The first relate to the timetable and the content of this initiative.	0.8862069159118874
You comment that these guidelines were adopted at too late a date, stressing, particularly your rapporteur, the risk that the previous programmes will be interrupted.	1.4212608202683623
It is true, I admit it, and you are well aware of the reasons, ladies and gentlemen.	1.4483977757682196
There is a delay in adopting the INTERREG guidelines in March or April 2000.	1.045442822443094
I accept this; I take note of it as you do.	0.9522094895459486
I note, however, that the Member States and the regions are already actively preparing the programmes for INTERREG III and indeed the guidance project was distributed over three months ago now.	1.2225083712727511
I also note that eligibility for expenditure shall be accepted from the date that programmes are presented and I can confirm the possibility that they may be available retroactively back to 1 January, if the programme is presented before 30 April.	1.293459847676849
So much for the first comment.	1.266515822833511
As to the second comment: regarding the non-comprehensive list of measures eligible under strand B, I wish to inform you, to confirm, that I have asked the Commission to accept the inclusion of other specific subjects, particularly in favour of small- and medium-sized businesses and of cultural heritage, in the list of schemes eligible under strand B and that therefore this list must no longer be considered as a comprehensive one.	1.4357792862997618
Third point: interregional cooperation, the importance of strand C. The Commission shares the observations made by this House regarding the importance of strand C, interregional cooperation.	1.264890348217307
As your rapporteur has requested, I shall send you the detailed information regarding the system for the implementation of this strand.	1.3162692654927255
Fourth observation: the European Observatory and the possible use of a technical assistance office.	1.2432627490626682
As you requested, I have decided to remove all references to the use of a technical assistance office in the text until the outcome of the debate in progress within the Commission on the service outsourcing systems.	1.3693315311178855
But, ladies and gentlemen, if we do remove every reference and any recourse to a TAO at a later date then this will have a consequence and that will be an increase in the number of officials' jobs needed to do this work, because somebody will have to do it and I cannot keep redeploying the same staff indefinitely, at a time when our duties are increasing with the pre-accession structural instrument (ISPA) and in order to ensure that, the Community appropriations for which I am responsible, often in partnership or on terms of coresponsibility with Member States, are monitored better, with discipline and transparency.	1.3387989817469643
Now to the implementation of INTERREG, a subject mentioned by many of you, and the potential eligibility under strand A, 'cross-border cooperation' , of schemes in the Adriatic, on behalf of Sicily or for the most remote regions, the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, understands your concerns and takes note of your requests on these various points.	1.501009112778369
I therefore intend to amend the guidelines in order to incorporate a specific priority into the transnational strand B: 'integrated cooperation of maritime and island regions' , so as to cover, in what I think is an appropriate fashion the various opportunities for cooperation between these regions.	1.2486556689083659
In addition to this one overture there is a second which we have already suggested to the Member States: greater financial flexibility between strand A and strand B. Thanks to these two overtures, especially the first, I can say that the Commission is willing to examine the case of Italian regions and regions of third countries around the Adriatic in order to promote the most appropriate cooperation under INTERREG, and with other instruments too, as soon as they become available.	1.4649875707726907
I have decided, in the end, that the most remote regions, to which I attach particular importance, will be given special priority in the context of the transnational strand of INTERREG, with a cooperation strategy which will aim at improving their links with their neighbours and other Member State regions.	1.3837573937561563
I also wish to express my concern to ensure good cooperation between INTERREG and the EDF, particularly for the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean.	1.1887475181366352
All this should make it possible for us, apart from the Objective 1 appropriations and also with them, to confirm the role of 'active frontier' of the Union.	1.2575660189877746
I adopt and wholeheartedly support this political objective that the seven most remote regions of the Union are actually active frontiers of the Union, even if, or precisely because, they are remote and located in other regions of the world where we must bring our influence and our action to bear.	1.384075219147638
Another point: the coordination between INTERREG, PHARE, TACIS and MEDA.	0.8782783457475707
It is true, once again, and I accept this objectively, that there are still real legal problems.	1.4227521282209283
I do not want to minimise these, but progress is being made as far as strand A cooperation with candidate countries is concerned, even if the problems related to the management procedures and to the scale of the projects still remain.	1.4017022088920579
The Commission must continue along these lines.	1.1292211226966167
I am making a personal commitment to do so.	0.8703742953575556
An initial joint PHARE/CIP committee is to meet in February to assess this coordination, and let me confirm my attentiveness and availability with regard to this, together with my colleagues and fellow Commissioners Verheugen, Patten and Poul Nielson.	1.2245548061512233
Finally, on the subject of technical assistance, on which your rapporteur and several of you commented. It goes without saying that the Commission will adhere to the terms of Article 23 of the general regulations regarding technical assistance, if it is indeed assistance intended to be an instrument useful to structural policy in general.	1.447495026213543
According to the general regulations, however, any technical assistance scheme which can claim a connection with a Community initiative must be proposed under Article 20, and not Article 23.	1.4872106356085857
This means that the ceiling of 0.25% mentioned in Article 23 does not apply with regard to this type of technical assistance.	1.1740381256902626
I attach great importance, ladies and gentlemen, in a spirit of discipline and transparency, to our nonetheless retaining some financial strands for matters relating to the exchange of experience and information, and not to propaganda, and to the implementation of networks ensuring good communication of best practice within the Union.	1.232321483971717
My conclusion regarding INTERREG, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is that these Community initiatives for which I am responsible fulfil a real need and everything that has been said is proof of this. They also foreshadow a real European regional planning policy within our enlarged Union.	1.357742059890302
The Commission attaches the greatest importance to this, just as you yourselves do.	1.154892370951177
I remain at your service in order, when the time comes, to present the report of previous planning which you request, but also to keep you informed regularly as to the implementation of these initiatives in the course of the new planning.	1.365501098424842
Repeating my thanks to each and every one of you, and also particularly to Arlene McCarthy and Francis Decourrière, I should like to point out that these two initiatives lie within a financial framework with which you are familiar: only EUR 700 million for URBAN, but this is better than nothing; EUR 4 billion 800 millions for INTERREG.	1.2584653843435638
So we are working within this framework and not outside it.	1.0876725946381096
On the subject of these two initiatives, then, with the light they cast on future strategic and political thinking regarding regional planning and on future financial perspectives, let me express our great interest in this constructive dialogue with the European Parliament and its committees.	1.307017984832577
Everything that I have just said, ladies and gentlemen, demonstrates that the Commission is resolved to taken the views of Parliament into account.	1.2301661226778928
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like firstly to thank Mr Procacci for his report.	1.1427406840069187
However, I should also like to extend thanks to the various committees involved and Parliament as a whole for the broad support which they have given the LEADER+ initiative.	1.516344464965285
This initiative should give the countryside new impetus to develop and test new and original ideas, ideas which it is then intended should at a later stage be incorporated in the general programmes as models.	1.1296519675361656
I am also pleased that Parliament essentially supports the Commission' s view that LEADER+ should be applied in all rural areas, that overriding priorities should be introduced and that, above all, active cooperation and networking between rural areas should be encouraged.	1.229004319040968
In addition, I note that Parliament shares the Commission' s view that the preferred form for implementing LEADER+ is the use of global grants.	1.249917064659907
Turning now to some of the individual questions raised here today, I can also confirm that we wish to have the widest possible partnership and participation in LEADER+.	1.4083743153474606
The various groups, be they environmental organisations or groups concerned with employment, have the possibility of taking part in drafting the Commission directives.	1.193061054991501
And there will not be less funds available than in the current period either; there will be more.	1.2169215653286383
I should also like to remind you that the idea of setting up an observatory is nothing new.	1.0197880941658635
There was also an observatory under LEADER I and LEADER II.	0.9069193063601272
It has one purpose only and that is precisely to maintain active networking between the individual LEADER groups.	1.1163966323665315
The cost of this observatory is not permitted to exceed 2% of the LEADER budget.	1.2010909301318167
As far as the possibility of having projects containing training initiatives is concerned, I might point out that this is precisely a point which we have now integrated into the new rural development policy, which means, in our view, that it is no longer necessary to do this as part of LEADER.	1.6122125865852168
I now come to the content of the report.	0.6331634311729072
In point 14, Parliament calls on the Commission to submit an evaluation report on LEADER II immediately.	1.2971550599648671
I should simply like to point out that this does not make very much sense at the present time because, as you know, it is still possible - and in fact will be until the end of 2001 - for LEADER II funds to be disbursed.	1.4024530180400347
We therefore think that it would be more sensible to wait until the programme' s conclusion before carrying out the evaluation.	1.0970144913376223
We will obviously do this and will also forward a report to you on it.	1.1417826719067405
In point 18, Parliament suggests publishing a compendium of examples of successful initiatives.	1.0083360272152677
In response I can only say that this already exists.	1.2073564672897987
It has already been compiled by the Commission and I can make a copy available to any Member of this House who is interested.	1.3716880275842802
In point 21, Parliament stresses that the guidelines in LEADER+ now need to be adopted quickly so that the programmes can start.	1.4154608625382212
I can only fully share your concern.	1.0147661166241033
As soon as the opinion is adopted here in Parliament, the guidelines for LEADER+ will again be presented to the STAR Committee so that the Member States can confirm the provisional agreement which they gave on 14 November.	1.364892121978168
I assume that the Commission will then be able to adopt the definitive version of the guidelines in March or April.	1.3999532123860812
And as soon as these are published in the Official Journal the remaining months - in fact six months - can be used to submit LEADER+ programmes.	1.3481638810041086
I believe that it is important to point out one thing: expenditure effected under LEADER+ is eligible from the time that the Commission programme starts running.	1.2375907560170376
For all programmes submitted before 30 April of this year it will be possible to backdate the beginning of the period of eligibility to 1 January.	1.1357328488285532
Finally, under point 20 the motion for a resolution contains seven specific proposals for amendments to the guidelines.	1.4528168982353777
Having given them thorough consideration, I can tell you that the proposals made under paragraphs 2, 4, 5 and 7 are acceptable to the Commission and are adopted.	1.295460187470178
The proposal in paragraph 6 will also be partly accepted because it reaffirms that the time allowed for approving programmes under LEADER+ is a maximum of 5 months.	1.0754825233826526
The amendment proposed under paragraph 1 has, in our view, been overtaken by events because, following consultations with the representatives of the Member States in the STAR Committee, this point has already been reworded along the lines proposed by Parliament.	1.2885536613536408
That therefore leaves only the amendment proposed under paragraph 3.	0.754192469044458
The Commission can only endorse this request because of course it corresponds precisely to what the Commission itself had originally proposed.	1.3545612134643144
I must add, however, that cooperation between our action groups and similar groups in third countries went too far for the Member States.	1.187557117523786
An amendment was therefore made in the committee, but the Commission will now again take account of Parliament' s concern in the revised version and table the guidelines in that form.	1.2839944165038242
It will also continue to fight for Member States' acceptance of this.	1.1401702031997307
I will comment briefly on the 13 amendments tabled.	0.7416162519535114
Here there are only three which the Commission cannot accept, Amendments Nos 3, 12 and 13.	1.2148555793860008
It can accept all of the others either in full or in essence.	1.030395448490302
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an exceptionally fortunate circumstance that we are debating the EQUAL initiative in the European Parliament just at this time.	1.4630524105509053
Recently, because of political developments in Austria, there is growing unease within Europe. Political demonstrations are taking place as well as political dialogue.	1.3811495576582982
It is worth stressing that both Parliament and the Commission must put forward specific policies.	1.306449237861799
We need specific proposals, both for legislation and for action programmes associated with the fight against discrimination and the formation of free and fair societies.	1.2350491479512316
So I will make brief mention of the package against discrimination and take this opportunity to ask the competent parliamentary committees to appoint their rapporteurs so that we can move ahead with the anti-discrimination package as soon as possible.	1.159700353085415
I now come to the EQUAL initiative, which is, of course, based on Article 13.	1.1588471936983327
The EQUAL initiative relates to all forms of discrimination within the meaning of Article 13, namely the fight against discrimination based on race, gender, age, and special needs.	1.1585989077794487
I would particularly like to congratulate Mrs Stenzel, because her effort to reach agreement on the EQUAL initiative has proved exceptionally difficult and complex, both because some of the committees involved view the issue in a different light and because it is a very sensitive political issue.	1.3989258738198749
The first comment, which has been made by many others too, is whether women should be mentioned separately.	1.4910161306550225
I agree that Article 13 contains something we have expressed our disagreement about, but that is how the Treaty stands right now and among the categories of types of discrimination, discrimination on the grounds of gender holds equal place.	1.1707793580412844
So on the basis of the Treaty as it stands today, the EQUAL initiative is structured in that way.	1.6100383617553056
I would like to remind you, however, that there is a special axis for the employment strategy which relates to women and that a special programme is being prepared, the fifth programme for equality between men and women.	1.254969229791042
I have classified the issues raised by the honourable Members into four groups.	0.8646196511167697
Firstly, the enlargement of the thematic areas.	1.3059471828735476
As in employment strategy, there are four thematic areas: employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities, and we agree that those thematic areas should be enlarged in line with the European Parliament' s proposals.	1.1544339132093988
To answer the concern whether there is a risk that a country might concentrate all the funds on one of the categories suffering discrimination, I will say that the initiative states clearly that the Member States must submit one thematic category for each group that is suffering discrimination.	1.4138740361989768
The second subject is flexibility and simplification.	0.6835883096819964
I agree with Mr Leinen that the wording of the initiative is indeed very difficult and hard to understand.	1.2583710973901128
That is why the services are already trying to revise the text, simplify its structure and make its wording easier to grasp.	1.0526366023131377
As regards the subject of flexibility, we propose development partnerships and cooperation both at the geographical level where different kinds of groups would cooperate in a specific geographical area to combat discrimination in the workplace, and at the thematic level where, for example, cooperation could take place in a specific economic sector.	1.3430788723427978
This would allow Member States great flexibility to tailor development cooperation to their own particular needs.	1.0456161887984123
Of course, a prerequisite for that is cooperation between the Member States, and a network which will assist the exchange of experience.	1.3809080435761785
Finally, I would like to mention technical assistance.	1.240098061871026
We are trying to arrange that there will be four categories for which funding is available.	0.8450642047565158
First, funding for preparation; second, implementation; third, mutual cooperation to ensure the exchange of experience, and fourth, technical assistance.	1.2072953466711465
Since there has been great involvement and concern about how technical assistance is to be provided, we must say that external offices will be used.	1.3699693330634128
As Mr Barnier too pointed out, it is impossible for all the work previously done by external collaborators to be done now by the Commission' s staff.	1.4418993996440477
The aim at national and European level is to establish large action groups by tender, with a full description of the project for which external assistance is to be requested. We would expect from each technical office a full description of the product so that the work can be monitored and appraised.	1.3416210396271269
I want to stress that it is extremely important to promote this specific initiative as quickly as possible, both for reasons of political timing and because we believe that it is important that it should begin as planned, in other words, we must be absolutely ready by the end of 2000.	1.3711120267692936
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6737777542510281
I shall convey your wish that the rapporteurs should be quickly appointed for the files you mentioned to my colleagues in the Bureau and to the appropriate committees.	1.080479318949977
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.	0.7385079679823764
(The sitting was closed at 8.40 p.m.)	0.44685942276484353
Approval of the Minutes of the two previous sittings	1.111207284074743
The Minutes of the sittings of Thursday 3 February and Monday 14 February have been distributed.	0.8367321823494628
The Minutes of 3 February were originally distributed in Brussels so perhaps this is why some Members did not receive them.	1.3548070347985495
Are there any comments?	0.1337831580886173
(The Minutes were approved)	0.08791063492812108
Madam President, my habit is always to be here for the opening of the part-session on Monday afternoons at 5.00 p.m.	1.1896389622247119
Yesterday it was impossible for myself and many MEPs to be here, because the 2.15 p.m. Air France flight, which normally brings us here, was cancelled, with no explanation from the airline, and we therefore arrived very late.	1.4782888692535043
If Air France insists on boycotting the European Parliament, we should take measures to prevent this occurring again.	1.3910548322680594
Thank you, Mr Medina Ortega.	1.2136757559378617
I too wholeheartedly regret this situation.	0.5888841017440186
Would you be so kind as to write to me so that I have proof with which to tackle the competent authorities of both Air France and the French Government?	1.1202520904826865
This situation really cannot continue and we must therefore protest most strongly.	1.161253610624265
Madam President, I had the same experience as Mr Medina Ortega yesterday.	1.3838533018607426
I feel that the French authorities - which have the honour of housing the European Parliament in Strasbourg - should be aware of their responsibility to ensure adequate connections with all the capitals of the Union.	1.5153763555336766
Absolutely, Mr Napolitano. Thank you.	1.253763003376914
Madam President, off the subject of aeroplane delays, I wish to apologise for the absence yesterday of my colleague in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Caroline Lucas, who is a British Member.	1.1389393298846493
She could not be here because she was arrested yesterday morning during an anti-nuclear demonstration in Glasgow.	0.9360474825245217
Although her identity was noted and her position as a Member of the European Parliament was very apparent, she was still held in custody all day.	1.1575908750208324
I regard this as absolutely unacceptable and would ask you to contact the British authorities in order to ensure that this does not happen again and that Mrs Lucas receives an apology. I have written to you in this respect together with my colleague, Mrs Hautala.	1.3359079950021608
Thank you, Mr Lannoye.	1.1813252923150441
I have received your letter and have already contacted the British Permanent Representative.	0.9155760696156465
Madam President, I should like to make a request in connection with today' s vote which I started to make yesterday during the debate on the EQUAL report.	1.2249077795546475
I should like the vote on the Community EQUAL initiative to be postponed because we need a bit more time to negotiate an important point.	1.3960386103449862
I am optimistic and quite relaxed and confident about the vote; we shall gain broad support for this opinion on EQUAL.	1.173239786711264
We just need a bit more time to work out the details on the asylum question and I would therefore request that the vote be postponed from this morning.	1.1893213230800586
Madam President, to follow on from the point that Mr Lannoye made: Mrs Lucas was arrested just outside Glasgow for protesting against the Trident base at Faslane.	1.2717174114693255
I have a lot of sympathy with that protest.	1.0097155685964667
I have, however, no sympathy for Mrs Lucas trying to hide behind her Parliamentary immunity.	1.1293088164965508
I have also been arrested for protesting at Faslane.	0.9736406833937069
I did not hide behind any immunity.	0.7529963565444137
I took the punishment that came to me.	0.7361555351875659
Mrs Lucas should do the same.	0.6286491623656923
Madam President, I would like to comment on the request Mrs Stenzel has made to postpone the vote on the Community initiative EQUAL until tomorrow.	1.103883803544959
In fact, this initiative was the subject of a very lively debate in committee, and, given that it is a major Commission proposal, which refers to the agreements we reached last year, I consider it admissible.	1.5031269007914383
We agree with Mrs Stenzel that the request to postpone the vote is admissible in the interests of achieving the greatest possible agreement between the groups, so that Parliament can express its position on this initiative with the broadest majority possible.	1.238364888331038
Does anyone want to speak against Mrs Stenzel' s request, as supported by Mrs Ghilardotti?	1.2579979981606702
If not, then we will proceed to the vote.	0.7744749597214394
(Parliament approved the request)	0.6904443920255533
Madam President, under Rule 29(4) you should be kept informed by political groups of any Members who have joined a new political group or who have left a political group.	1.3502528276034742
Have you received any notification of any Members leaving the Group of the European People's Party or does the Austrian People's Party continue to sit in that political group?	1.1668774935247574
Mr Corbett, I have not received any notification.	1.4857151427735678
Madam President, I am amazed at Mr Corbett' s reaction.	1.2318416849862466
He should find other ways of raising his profile than expressing views on such matters here.	0.8145740827761243
We are solidly with our Austrian friends who have proven to be good Europeans in the past.	0.8563556699270803
They have our full support.	0.30728307381377584
(Applause)	-0.0
Agenda	-0.0
With regard to the agenda for Thursday, following a request made yesterday in plenary, I propose extending the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance by half an hour to 6.00 p.m. when the vote will take place.	1.2952639945261484
(Parliament gave its assent)	0.06492846330865369
Commission's strategic objectives and legislative programme	0.6738268719262565
The next item is the joint debate on the Commission statements on its strategic objectives for the coming five years and the annual legislative programme for 2000.	1.137843133859069
I therefore immediately give the floor to the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi.	1.0858031103787904
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a five-year programme is an extremely important undertaking, and this is why I preferred that you be given the unabridged text of the speech, which is available in four languages.	1.4256348427374552
To respect my speaking time, I will confine myself to referring only to the broad outlines of my programme: a programme for the dawning of a new legislature and a new century, when it is right and proper to see Europe in a broader perspective, a Europe which is currently in a paradoxical situation.	1.3757052364415363
Let us remember that for half a century, Europe has provided us with peace, security and freedom and a united Europe has also contributed to giving us a period of unprecedented prosperity.	1.2292594263986958
We are now seeing the beginning of a strong recovery, which it appears may even be sustainable for a good while yet if we are prudent with our policies.	1.3930200877592254
This recovery is the logical consequence of the efforts we have made, but it comes at a price: it follows the restructuring of public accounts in European countries, which have kept inflation under control with a policy wisely intended to control costs and increase productivity in a Europe that has begun a vigorous restructuring of its own industries, banks and public services, even though this process is not yet complete and still has a long way to go.	1.3356524643513448
Nevertheless, despite these aspects, European citizens are disappointed and concerned: by unemployment which is not falling quickly enough; by a Europe trailing behind in technology, and seemingly falling even further behind, and in particular a scientific sector which is starting to lag a long way behind too; by the European institutions which appear distant and do not seem to be in step with the times, starting with the Commission itself.	1.4161738126637127
The crisis in the Commission was, in fact, a crucial point in the relationship between Europe and its citizens, and the low turnout at the European elections was a worrying indication of this.	1.5092777613361936
Even stronger still, however, is the sense of insecurity, the feeling of being unprepared in a new world that is moving forwards, a world which is completely changing, where globalisation will even end up changing our points of reference.	1.3277822434430384
This is not the first time this has happened: Europe was once confronted with a similar transformation, an explosion of its markets, a change in its points of reference and a different view of the world.	1.3634119379343295
I am referring to the sixteenth century when the discovery of America turned everything upside down.	0.7393968900174839
Some countries - such as France and Spain - managed to meet the challenge, giving rise to great nation States; other countries - such as Italy - did not meet this challenge and lost all the headway that they had accumulated during the first part of that millennium: headway in science, technology, economic progress, defence structures and military organisation, philosophy and literature.	1.1850959485127943
Today, Europe is facing a similar challenge, and we know that, just as history has been unforgiving in the past, it will not be forgiving in the present.	1.4214388094411718
In this context of wholesale change, and in order to prevent our nation States vanishing again, in the wake of globalisation which is creating hitherto unprecedented scales and challenges, Europe needs to be economically strong, because globalisation demands unity, because every day we hear news of new agreements at world level and news of changes at European level too.	1.353442652398827
But more vital still is a Europe that feels strong in the political arena.	1.0365054034087406
In years past, the single market and the single currency have been the pivotal point of our actions, the mainstay of European life.	1.3470385418272495
Today, the new frontiers of European integration are political frontiers: common foreign and security policy, justice and internal security, and - to a lesser extent - the crucial question of the fundamental political values on which our coexistence is based.	1.4455258494765268
The Commission has therefore adopted the strategic programme for 2000-2005, a programme that was immediately sent to the European Parliament and with which you are already familiar, so I will not go into detail about it now.	1.5016261964512672
Some of you may find it lacks detail, but no political structure sets out detailed five-year programmes.	1.2432154076958306
This is the European Union, not the Soviet Union.	1.5317164878347933
Our programme highlights the major points of reference, the major areas for action: firstly, the development of new forms of governance for Europe; secondly, extension and enlargement of the area of peace, freedom, and security; thirdly, the launch of a new stage in the growth of the economy; fourthly, safeguarding and improving quality of life.	1.3534364054393773
These will be our major guidelines for action over the next five years.	0.8032937445911522
With regard to the first area - new forms of governance for Europe - you already know that the Commission has undertaken to produce a White Paper and not a full legislative text since, in the light of major issues which are changing the structure of the way we interact, the Commission is first of all preparing for a debate; we will subsequently discuss the content with you; this will give rise to a policy document, and finally, a legislative document.	1.5855381399290982
This is an effective, transparent way to proceed and involve all the European institutions and the citizens of Europe.	1.3705603895702516
This White Paper is a response to the challenges that enlargement is forcing on us, an enlargement that is forcing us to rethink the workings of all our institutions, rethink our very policies - all our policies - and above all rethink what we must continue to do at Union level when the Member States number 25 or 30, and what will be the best thing to do at individual State level, at regional level and at local government level.	1.4291813133014344
But it is not only enlargement that is urging us towards this rethink: as I said a few moments ago, it is also economic and political globalisation itself.	1.4614551809544511
We must govern Europe in such a way as to make us more efficient, to bring us closer to the citizens and to encourage everyone to get involved, starting with the important issue of the involvement of women.	1.2240972370165621
One of the main differences in the comparison made recently between Europe and the United States was not so much job mobility or risk capital, as women' s involvement in economic life, an issue that has much more prominence in the United States than in Europe. This is a field where Europe has, nevertheless, always been in the vanguard.	1.4338323189937487
We therefore need to reflect on this at length and with an open mind, and all the institutions - Commission, Parliament, Council - will have to consider their own roles and their own policies.	1.4553207079326629
We shall therefore get straight back to work on this White Paper, although in order to finish it, we shall have to wait for the results of the Intergovernmental Conference, and it will therefore not be ready until spring 2001.	1.3933214798765234
It will not be a philosophical Paper, but a practical Paper, full of focused proposals.	1.3629998327396453
We - the Commission - are the first to know that we must have a total rethink, and we shall therefore do two things: we are, and will continue to be, fully committed to internal reform, and we shall rethink our policies in detail.	1.629547115890768
I have asked all the Commissioners - and I shall ask them once again in a still more analytical way - to pinpoint all the activities that we can forgo.	1.4771947322395906
The Commission must define what its fundamental activities are, what it must concentrate on and shed its non-essential activities, thereby freeing up new resources and ensuring a more correct and co-operative relationship with individual countries, regions and local communities.	1.179449095321778
So we shall be freeing up new resources, but - I fear, and I want to state this before Parliament - the time will come when these new resources that we are already freeing up will, in turn, be insufficient in terms of allowing us to address our new tasks: I am thinking of enlargement, the new sector of justice and home affairs, health issues and environmental matters.	1.5302274567138157
When that time comes, when we have used up all our resources, I shall not hesitate to come here before you to request further resources, but what I am saying now is that if we are not given these necessary resources, we shall have to refuse to take on any new duties because the available resources will not be commensurate with the new tasks that we will be taking on.	1.5559180518809477
As for internal reform, you well know how committed my Commission has been to this since day one.	1.2481543085693672
I know full well that we will not be able to achieve any political objective if the Commission does not undertake vigorous and comprehensive internal reform, if it does not become more efficient, if it does not increase efficiency in all sectors, starting with the sector in which the worst backlogs have built up in the past - external aid.	1.2464857712904611
Providing aid rapidly, when it is needed, saves human lives; in many cases providing it late is worse than not providing it at all.	1.043286509705436
When I speak about external aid, my thoughts immediately turn to the Balkans. There is cause for hope thanks to the commitment of our workers on the ground, an extraordinary commitment given our organisational problems.	1.3275099559918266
My thoughts also turn to Bernard Kouchner' s efforts, of the stability pact that we all vigorously support with total dedication, but I also think of new events, such as Croatia, where the situation has changed in a few weeks: the European institutions immediately opened the way to dialogue with this country and received the news knowing full well that the only way to resolve not only Bosnia' s problems, but more particularly Serbia' s problems is to throw a curtain of democracy around Serbia.	1.4893858960884854
This is the new element that we must help to bring to the Balkans.	1.3916678450494269
We must increase our efficiency in this area. We must reopen the Danube to boats.	1.4243687588166465
It is contradictory to offer aid to Romania and Bulgaria yet leave these countries unable to harness their greatest resource.	0.8485801328116922
We must decontaminate the river and, in view of this, over the next few days the Commissioner responsible for the environment will be putting forward specific plans to monitor this serious problem.	1.3162077925108975
We have done a lot in the Balkans: the new European Reconstruction Agency for Kosovo, the Balkans Task Force and new regulations to speed up procedures.	1.503776145786431
Nevertheless, we definitely have to do more.	1.5996348353839145
We must liberalise trade within the region and between the region and the European Union; we must contribute to building infrastructural links that will end its centuries-old isolation; we must intensify efforts to build a democratic, pluralist society in these countries with institutions, public structures, police forces and a structured civil society, but, above all, we must press these countries to work together in the context of a united region, as regards both politics and the economy.	1.4300534986496671
If we do not do this, we shall have failed in our duty.	1.3793184921719535
Remember that the Marshall Plan was not effective simply because of the scale of its resources: it was even more effective because it made us Europeans work together towards a new horizon; it gave us a fresh outlook in terms of our politics and our economy.	1.1912583391434213
This is what we need to do for the Balkans.	1.3600485718147122
Europe must prove - in the Balkans and the rest of the world - its ability to extend the area of security, peace and freedom and its ability to take a leading role on the international stage.	1.3060853575402354
We are clearly, once again, returning to enlargement, which must be put into practice in tandem with the extension of the area of security, peace and freedom.	1.0375093489539378
We have made many promises in this regard, but I believe we shall succeed in keeping our promises even though we have a very delicate path to tread.	1.429379496553359
Indeed, enlargement, which will be with us for our five years in office and beyond - I am referring to the aspirations of applicant countries - must hinge on concrete, objective criteria, and also on reassuring public opinion in the countries involved and, to an even greater degree, public opinion in our own Member States.	1.443098877418337
There will be friendship, calm, openness but also a certain strictness in the enlargement process.	1.0527101236206307
I repeat: we must reassure public opinion in those countries that wish to join but we need to provide public opinion in our own Member States with even greater reassurance.	1.3656975273410115
Our responsibilities do not stop at enlargement, or at the Balkans.	1.1064476987579792
There are certain other key issues: relations with Ukraine, relations with Russia, relations with neighbouring countries and more importantly, the important question of relations with the southern Mediterranean which will be a crucial point for European history, and for security and peace in Europe for future generations. In this regard, we have a responsibility towards the whole of Africa.	1.3912966730579912
In recent times, Africa has raised hopes and has received offers of help, but nothing tangible has yet been achieved. In recent years in Africa, we have not seen a shift from totalitarian regimes to democracy, but quite the contrary - a shift from democracy to totalitarian regimes.	1.3440854605489474
Africa is, for us, a worrying topic for discussion. We therefore have another duty at international level, which has already been proposed by the Commissioner responsible for trade: the undertaking to relaunch the Millennium Round and to take on some fundamental problems affecting the poorest countries, not just in terms of writing off debts, but also via the unilateral opening-up to trade with the poorest countries in the world, with a great deal of willingness on our part, which we had already proposed prior to Seattle but which we could not put into practice.	1.5210290715251262
We need to provide alternative answers, otherwise episodes such as those seen in Seattle will be repeated over and over and will come to hamper one of Europe' s positive roles in history.	1.2025057023523136
All over the world, Europe' s actions must be guided by a deep respect for the principles of freedom and respect for the rights of individuals and minorities.	1.1478759891243446
We should remember that we, the European Union, are a union of minorities: we are all a minority within Europe.	1.508751519271161
There are concerns even within the Fifteen, concerns which may even surface again in the next decade.	1.2681551562894608
I am referring to the situation in Austria, where the Commission has remained true to its role, being duty-bound to work towards the cohesion of the Union, but also the unwavering guardian of the Treaties, ready to punish every minor breach of the principles of democracy, law and respect for minorities.	1.28505297076397
Some people have criticised me over the congratulatory message I sent to Chancellor Schüssel.	0.7687446801182406
My message to you is: do not take the necessary and proper courtesies of form to mean that I have been less firm in the content.	1.2550327107476686
Reread the letter: The reference to the fundamental values of the Union is taken - and this is more than mere coincidence - from Article 6 of the Treaty, I repeat, Article 6 of the Treaty.	1.307793876842591
I would also ask you whether you believe that any other European head of government has ever been reminded of these principles by the Commission when they were elected.	1.3402333852983337
This is what we wish to do: maintain our role as a supranational structure, maintain the role conferred on us by the Treaties, but also be unwavering on principles and make judgements based on facts.	1.271569224750583
Last November, the Commission tabled a proposal for an anti-racism directive.	1.314611657560315
I would ask the Council to adopt it swiftly and I would ask Parliament to help us with this action which will further strengthen the fundamental bases of our social cohesion.	1.374018668183167
I will quickly conclude by mentioning the last two points of our programme: the economy and quality of life.	1.1081832298583534
I have already talked about the economy: we well know which basic ingredients will set Europe on the path towards a lasting recovery which will in turn create more jobs.	1.0889771807744009
We must continue to keep inflation under control, proceed with liberalisation, ensure more competition, encourage the dissemination of information technology and all new technologies; push forward with science, and push back scientific boundaries, and develop an appetite for being at the cutting edge of science.	1.0632189349715573
The forthcoming Lisbon Summit on these issues - dissemination of technology, employment - will be a decisive summit.	1.298147046609064
It has taken four years for us to be in a position to hold a summit of this kind.	1.2646853657324197
We are at last holding it and cannot let this opportunity slip through our fingers.	1.0721590859886692
Finally, our last commitment is to improve quality of life.	1.4827786140177486
We have opened this chapter with the White Paper on Food Safety: we now need to make significant headway in the environment sector.	1.2039817207565955
The Erika oil slick and the contamination of the Danube demonstrates the pressing need for European scale intervention to safeguard the environment.	1.0622235832713143
The time has come to discuss, and then establish, a body for emergency civil protection in Europe.	1.2961017589808728
All too often we find ourselves calling for this after a disaster has occurred.	1.0398326907257114
I think it would be appropriate to begin thinking about these things before disasters happen.	0.9726880968277278
These are the challenges that we - the Commission but also all the other European institutions - are facing.	1.533673875119139
How will we judge, ladies and gentlemen, Madam President, the five years of our mandate?	1.1843923894091697
How are we going to assess the results of these five years?	1.094916020710154
I do not know, but one benchmark we could certainly use is the challenge we must take up together.	1.560374238414986
Let us take a very simple parameter: turnout at the next European elections.	0.808782403792368
If it is higher than at the previous elections, it will mean that we have successfully met our challenge.	1.300079174859764
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are faced with all these major political challenges, but precisely because of the recovery that is now underway, we are also faced with major opportunities.	1.4054023679157537
This, ladies and gentlemen, could be the decade of Europe. Indeed, I would say that this must be the decade of Europe.	1.403342069237744
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats welcomes this debate and we welcome the fact that the Commission submitted a document so that we could prepare for the debate.	1.1458473815310077
We also welcome the conclusions which we find in this document.	0.9238114073555971
And we welcome the broad outlines of the speech which President Prodi has just given.	0.9289774830340636
We read in the conclusions in the document that the five-year term of office of the Prodi Commission will be a time of major changes.	1.4637378069573792
Europe will press ahead with integration; at the same time the Union will start an enlargement process which will, in the end, reunite our continent.	1.1672213845180168
A demanding, ambitious, perhaps even prophetic task and we wish you every success, Mr President of the Commission.	1.005732386531048
However, we consider that the present is the basis of the future and we shall only be able to shape the future if we prove our worth in the present.	1.4833164590864336
I say that in all earnestness and I have chosen my words carefully.	1.1831274395959106
I refer to the current debate on the present conflicts in the European Union.	1.1453368022128148
We in the European Union are one Community.	1.3466361398520275
We belong together, even when there are problems.	1.2266460853287962
Now is not the time to isolate but to unite and to complete together the task of unifying Europe.	1.075146347056956
Mr President of the Commission, you have represented and defended the European Parliament time and again over recent weeks.	1.2737420886881867
You have seen yourself as the guardian of the Treaties, and that is indeed your role.	1.10513800199858
For that and for the letter to the Federal Chancellor of the Republic of Austria which you mentioned, we expressly respect, acknowledge and support you.	1.2837529342801015
(Applause)	-0.0
Mr President of the Commission, our objectives are one and the same: we want a strong Europe in the twenty-first century, a democratic Europe which is able to act.	1.3573103193979412
A Europe which defends its values of human dignity and democratic rule of law both internally and to the outside world and, at the same time, looks after its global interests with dignity, patience and convincing self-confidence.	1.043471460795821
Europe' s message, the European Union' s message to the world should not be one of arrogance or even European nationalism, no; it must be one of cooperation, partnership and peaceful development.	1.3742105441763366
Globalisation gives us the chance to shape the world, which is becoming smaller and smaller, as a world of peaceful competition and solidarity.	1.3810495558823932
Seen in this light, globalisation is more of an opportunity than a danger, more of a coming together than a segregation, more mutual enrichment than separation.	1.1839221341510053
But we also know that we can only shape the huge challenge of globalisation together as Europeans.	1.308960728080013
Globalisation is not only an economic process, it is also a cultural process, which is why we say: we want partnership in the world, we do not want the clash of civilisations which many are predicting, we want partnership, a meeting, exchange and peace.	1.4979127262232534
But we also say: we want to defend this European Community of tolerance, which is why a common foreign, security and defence policy is so important.	1.5663972155320658
Negotiations with six central European countries are starting today, bringing the European family a step closer together.	1.0902427593945405
We agree with what you said about the Barcelona process.	0.9795634742373245
All the countries in the Mediterranean area must acknowledge human dignity, democracy and the rule of law.	0.8024385123610752
