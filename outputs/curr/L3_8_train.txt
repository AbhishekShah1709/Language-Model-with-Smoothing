Only few patients with AIS are referred to a hospital within three hours after onset of symptoms, and only 3% of these patients qualify for treatment with rt-PA.	1.2025629557505357
Therefore, only few patients with AIS will potentially benefit from therapy with rt-PA if NINDS criteria are applied.	1.144448207185157
The goal of the Second European-Australasian Acute Stroke Study (ECASS II) was to evaluate safety and efficacy of thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA in AIS for a 6 hour time window.	1.1482749964833674
Objective: To prove the response and side effects of sulphasalazine in early and late onset juvenile pauciarthritis, also the therapeutic effect dependent on the marker HLA B27.	1.2112058652523259
The radiologic imaging methods play an important role in the precise staging as basic requirement for an effective concept of tumor therapy.	0.9134737858378962
The accuracy of ultrasound in the primary staging according to the TNM-classification (UICC) was therefore prospectively investigated in 260 patients with head and neck tumors of the clinical stages T1N0 to T4N3.	1.1648109916419849
The clinically (C1) and sonographically (C2) evaluated pretherapeutic stages were compared to the postoperative histopathologic tumor classifications.	1.057798331978777
The clinical staging was correct in 75.0 %, high in 7.7 %, low in 17.3 %, the N-stages were correct in 59.2 %, high in 17.7 %, low in 23.1 %.	1.288550176669516
The sonographic staging was apparently superior with the T-classifications correct in 92.3 %, high in 7.7 %, low 0.0 %.	1.1339576816446584
The N-stages were correct in 89.6 %, high in 9.2 %, low in 1.2 %.	1.1914347506894563
The accuracy of combined TN classification rose from clinical 46.5 % to 84.6 % by sonography.	1.2198968738259568
Accompanying inflammations, foregoing biopsies and tooth extractions were the main reasons for incorrect staging.	0.8449468525322416
Therefore, the thorough sonographic investigation performed after the clinical examination and before invasive procedures, due to little patient discomfort, good availability and high accuracy, is an excellent sectional imaging method for staging, therapy-planning and follow up of tumors of the head and neck especially of the orofacial regions.	1.179467887752515
Standardized guidelines for exercise training for patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) have not been established.	1.0088979165816665
In the past CHF patients involved in exercise training studies demonstrated a wide range of cardiac and functional impairment, with an ejection fraction between 18 and 35% and a peak VO2 between 12.2 and 25.4 ml/kg/min on average.	1.2798899907225636
For determination of training intensity, a VO2 between 40 and 70% of peak VO2 and/or training heart rate between 60 and 80% of peak heart rate was used.	1.1912703844719423
There was also a wide range for frequency (between 3 and 7 times per week) and duration of training (between 20 and 60 min per session).	1.1551550555277788
For aerobic exercise training only continuous training methods were applied.	0.7334248976959393
We have developed a new interval training method which allows intense exercise stimuli on peripheral muscles with minimal cardiac strain.	0.8676823304700014
After only three weeks of training, the improvement in aerobic capacity was similar to that reported after longer training periods using continuous methods.	1.0235250321928466
To determine work rate for work phases of interval training, a special steep ramp test was developed.	0.8842102668258034
By analysis of acute physical responses to this testing procedure and to the interval training, both were proven to be tolerable in CHF patients, even if their ejection fraction is as low as 13%, or peak cardiac index not greater than 1.6 l/m2/min, and peak VO2 less than 8.5 ml/kg/min.	1.277022483089693
Therapeutic choice in laryngeal carcinoma is influenced by the nature of the tumor and a variety of factors involving the patient and physician.	1.0132965741882363
Small (T1) and exophytic (T1, T2) tumors are suitable for radiotherapy.	0.88046122604092
Limited lesions (T1, T2) can be cured by functional endoscopic resection techniques or external partial laryngectomies.	0.8181034691975835
Extensive tumors (large T2; T3) are treated by total laryngectomy or by primary irradiation, especially in the case of a good response to induction chemotherapy.	1.0708604721939006
When radiation treatment fails, surgery succeeds in more than half of the cases.	0.8225432381314025
Tumors infiltrating or transgressing the laryngeal framework (T4) can only be cured by total laryngectomy followed by radiotherapy.	0.910088959816787
Subtotal or circular ablation of the adjacent pharynx or esophagectomy needs repair with visceral or myocutaneous grafts.	0.846896013463487
Lymphatics are preferentially treated with the same modality as used in the primary disease.	1.2315445471131479
Inconspicuous lymphatics should be treated electively in most cases, with the exception of early glottic cancer.	1.0825768613859317
Induced hypotension is defined as a reduction in mean arterial blood pressure to 50-60 mm Hg in normotensive subjects.	1.065967778343206
The aim of induced hypotension is to decrease intraoperative blood loss, decrease the need for blood transfusions and improve operating conditions.	1.2180341243032982
Most studies indicate that induced hypotension can decrease intraoperative blood loss by 50% in many surgical procedures; however, some studies report that blood loss is not significantly reduced.	1.218914970149845
Current methods of induced hypotension are based on the use of rapid and short-acting vasodilators as primary agents (nitroprusside, nitroglycerine, urapidil), supplemented by volatile anesthetics (isoflurane) and/or -blockers (esmolol) to improve effect, reduce dosage and prevent side effects (reflex tachycardia, tachyphylaxis, rebound hypertension).	1.0923850535294766
Proper positioning of the patient and controlled ventilation aid in reducing blood loss.	1.1100341104193103
Major risks of induced hypotension are a reduction in blood flow (i.e.	0.9422030875267671
ischaemia) of vital organs (brain, myocardium) and elevation of intracranial pressure in neurosurgical patients.	1.1418928862816728
Thus, major contraindications of induced hypotension are severe coronary artery disease, hypertension combined with arteriosclerosis of cerebral vessels and increased intracranial pressure in patients with cerebral disease.	1.1886115616183033
Complications are rare in otherwise healthy patients, but may be higher in elderly patients and those with underlying organ dysfunction.	1.1822172304945535
Therefore, careful assessment and selection of patients, together with consideration of the potential complications, appropriate choice of drugs and invasive beatby-beat monitoring, are essential for the safe practice of induced hypotension.	1.1499607656278867
Abstract  Empirical results stemming from infant research have contributed extensively to the understanding of coping with psychosocial stress and vulnerability for psychosomatic symptoms in later life.	0.8212291166754008
The interaction and the emotional exchange between caregiver and child in the first months of life lead to representations of interactions that will be the base for the quality of attachment.	1.0285115214177807
The mutual regulation of the caregiver-infant-pair enables the child to acquire a psychic capacity to regulate physiological requirements.	0.8594606209724149
This selfregulatory function determines the potential of the later adult to react to distress - in a symbolic way using words or more in a somatic way by developing psychosomatic symptoms.	1.138767807780498
First experiences with the treatment of psychosomatic patients with respect to the new findings about self-regulation are reported.	1.1507341233238724
A 31-year-old pregnant woman had to undergo emergency abdominal surgery due to acute intestinal obstruction.	0.9439632734450176
The patient's preoperative history demonstrated multiple allergies as well as abdominal trauma several years before.	1.06312877430321
The physical examination - including sonography of the two fetuses - showed no pathological signs.	1.406657232040353
Anaesthesia was induced intravenously with the operating table tilted to the left side, using routine precautions pre-oxygenation, and rapid sequence intubation, and was maintained unproblematically.	1.2886948620799212
About 20 min after the onset of surgery, hypotension, tachycardia, and a drop in oxygen saturation appeared.	1.0894010522088142
Volume substitution and the application of vasoactive drugs failed to stabilise the haemodynamic situation.	0.8012757537246775
Elevation of the pregnant uterus and increased left tilzing of the operating table did not lead to improvement.	0.8901994924774668
The development of eyelid edema led to the diagnosis of an anaphylactic reaction.	1.0274394567755836
The patient was treated successfully with epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids (prednisolone).	0.9695784635799545
The suspicion of latex-related allergy was verified postoperatively by radio-allergen-sorbent test (RAST) and prick and scratch tests.	0.862602277090738
The mean arterial blood pressure is decreased during the first two trimesters of pregnancy and increases to preconceptional values during the last weeks of gestation.	1.1271228524011767
The heart rate increases during the whole course of pregnancy.	0.6487508427560903
During late gestation fewer patients show an increase in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate in the standing position.	0.7303311056009192
A fall in heart rate was only seen in this period.	1.0351863328122224
A fall in mean arterial blood pressure during standing is not related to the blood pressure in the supine position during the whole course of pregnancy.	0.840596411618373
The hypotensive symptoms are twice as frequent during early pregnancy compared to late pregnancy.	0.803208300127027
Headaches, fatigue and cold extremities are the most usual complaints.	1.0193299810061573
The frequency and intensity of these three symptoms decrease during gestation.	0.9561515686635582
Blood pressure in the supine position is reduced in symptomatic pregnant women.	0.7798160637993199
However, the occurrence of these symptoms is not correlated to the fall in blood pressure in the standing position.	1.0035090639738664
The Birth-weight is not influenced by blood pressure in the supine position, but depends on the fall in blood pressure during standing.	0.953978845388736
Pregnant women with a more pronounced fall in blood pressure give birth to newborns with a lower birthweight.	1.0297171956624218
These results imply a hitherto unknown cause of intrauterine growth restriction.	0.7570771656596449
The combination of saltwater baths and subsequent ultraviolet irradiation is an effective treatment for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.	0.9009071167927026
The aim of the present study was to determine the photosensitizing properties of two commercially available bath salts, original salt from the Dead Sea and sodium chloride.	0.8607381762206124
To address this issue, test areas on the volar aspects of the forearms were soaked with salt solutions for 15 minutes prior to ultraviolet-B (UVB) irradiation.	0.8599515479098411
The salt concentrations tested were 1%, 3% 5% and 15%.	1.5556827783070593
Tap water followed by UVB and UVB alone served as controls.	0.6550364823639546
Erythema was determined by visual and photometric measurement, and delayed tanning was assessed by colorimetry.	1.0074443133968214
Erythema obtained by wetting the skin prior to UVB irradiation was more pronounced than erythema induced by UVB alone.	0.8548964608048173
The most prominent erythema was yielded by tap water+UVB.	0.8239435915429827
The salts had a differing photosensitizing capacity and the strongest erythema was produced by the 5% solutions.	1.0005588170804198
There was only a moderate influence on delayed tanning by bathing the skin prior to irradiation.	0.8543284362099662
The results from the present study indicate that soaking the skin with salt solutions or tap water increases skin sensitivity to subsequent UVB irradiation.	1.0334878386758424
This may contribute to the effectiveness of salt water baths followed by UV irradiation and may account for an increased sunburn risk after bathing.	0.8112352928987306
Introduction: The aim of the study was to evaluate the modern principles of surgery in diverticulitis, e. g. early elective resection and primary anastomosis.	0.9809885896192417
Methods: The data of 445 consecutive patients were retrospectively analysed after classifying all cases in four subgroups according to a modified Hinchey classification (stages 0-III).	1.0557681834508426
Results: Within our study group the morbidity was 26.5 % (n = 118) and the mortality was 1.6 % (n = 7).	1.4717669289055162
In 96 % (n = 425) of all cases and in 64 % (21/33) of patients with perforated diverticulitis and peritonitis (stage III), a primary anastomosis was performed.	1.533243039762048
Four patients of the study group showed insufficient anastomosis (0.9 %).	1.1122021077390567
No leakage was observed from any of the anastomoses performed in stage III diverticulitis.	0.9543401434539346
Stage of inflammation and age of patient correlate with morbidity and mortality.	0.8781080170326689
Some 53 % (94/177) of the patients in stage II and 67 % (22/33) of the patients in stage III had never showed symptoms of diverticulitis before.	1.385675605615654
Conclusion: Prophylactic surgery to avoid life-threatening situations, including abscess formation or perforation, is not possible in many cases.	1.51488654357815
However, especially patients at risk (age, coexisting illness) should undergo early surgery.	1.389329640978069
Primary anastomosis can be performed safely even at an advanced stage.	0.8689429430396199
To evaluate whether MRI is usefull in staging renal cell carcinomas with caval thrombus the accuracy of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in staging renal tumors with caval thrombus were preoperatively examined.	0.8863042847413681
Tumor staging by CT and MR imaging were correlated with histopathological tumor stadium.	0.9003879416454605
In MRI 4 out of 7 thrombi were correctly diagnosed with high accuracy, in CT none.	1.0175323322355976
In advanced renal carcinoma MRI with Gadolinium was superior to CT imaging, especially in diagnosing tumor thrombus.	1.0390853478644337
Consequently the extent of tumor thrombus may be assessed by MRI which therefore may replace conventional cavography.	0.9849650991587381
Children of mothers chronically infected with hepatitis-C-virus (HCV) during pregnancy and delivery were prospectively followed.	1.0011563738013745
90 children born to 85 infected mothers were included in our study; nine of the mothers were known to be co-infected with HIV-1.	1.1828561600581557
These 90 children were first tested within 60 days after birth and followed for at least three months.	0.9712709455501538
Three of the 90 children became infected perinatally with HCV as shown by persistence of antibodies after 2 years of life and a positive result in the RT-PCR.	1.117877693098893
One of these 3 children has evidence of ongoing hepatitis as shown by slightly elevated alanine aminotransferase values, but is otherwise clinically well, likewise the other 2 infected children.	1.0621366142663204
54 of the 87 uninfected children were followed until they lost maternal antibodies after an average of one year.	0.8922065847995121
Cor triatriatum dexter is a rare congenital malformation in which a membrane divides the right atrium into two chambers.	1.1320926323039997
The membrane represents a persistence of the right sinus venosus valve (RSV).	0.8723950808577625
Normally the RSV regresses between the 9th and 15th week of gestation, as the cephalic portion forms the crista terminalis and the caudal portion develops into the Eustachian and Thebesian valve.	0.9463822674305462
Any failure in the regression process may result in remnants of RSV as a simple muscle bar, a Chiari-network or a fenestrated or unfenestrated membrane (cor triatriatum dexter).	0.9089946235700007
We describe a patient with cor triatriatum dexter in whom diagnosis was made several years after successful valvulotomy procedure for severe congenital valvular pulmonary stenosis.	1.0243191744706963
Apoptosis and proliferation are important regulators of normal development and homeostasis in the bone marrow.	0.9232163973731216
Therefore, dynamics of hematopoiesis is mainly defined by these two parameters.	1.1964548937929889
However, since only few data are available from previous studies, we performed a retrospective analysis to elucidate some aspects of this complex pathomechanism.	1.4065507303712432
A total of 400 patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPDs) and corresponding reactive bone marrow lesions were enrolled into this study.	1.0778797094315942
Apoptosis was detected in bone marrow tissue by the ISEL-technique and topoisomerase II  expression was demonstrated by the monoclonal antibody Ki-S1.	0.9442737708406562
Furthermore, by determination of the proliferating-cell nuclear antigen labeling (PCNA) index, we were able to calculate the proportion of cells in the G2/M phase, because both nuclear antigens are expressed in different phases of the cell cycle.	1.1504027420804595
Patients with IMF, PV, and ET revealed a normal range of apoptosis, whereas in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) a significant increase could be observed.	1.2265377545421965
On the other hand, IMF and PV were characterized by a raised proliferative activity.	0.7741975202394207
Dynamics of hematopoiesis was assessed by calculation of the so called hematopoietic turnover index.	0.8832905111163739
In CML and reactive lesions no alterations of this parameter were detectable, but IMF and PV showed a significant increase.	1.1025708260107228
Survival analysis disclosed a relevant worsening of life expectancy for patients with reduced apoptosis and proliferation.	0.9685038394821008
In conclusion, our in-situ results confirm and extend previous experimental data on hematopoietic cell kinetics.	1.1114208211330836
In this context, a greater regenerative capacity of hematopoiesis may be reflected by an increased rate of apoptosis and/or proliferation and therefore is associated with a more favorable outcome.	1.1334809798698124
In a complex animal model in sheep, polydioxanone (PDS) and polylactic membranes were used for the reconstruction of large orbital-wall defects.	1.022562605831377
In a long-term experiment over 1 year, polylactic implants alone showed the best performance as compared with combinations involving autogenous bone grafts and titanium miniplate fixation.	0.9123167599463222
As soon as these polylactic implants are approved for human surgery, they will be used to solve the still challenging problem of anatomical reconstruction of large comminuted fractures of more than one orbital wall.	1.0912755541853365
Surgery by three-dimensional (3D) endoscopy is being used routinely in abdominal surgery and, in special cases, in thoracic surgery; however, it has not been reported as being used in microlaryngeal surgery.	1.1405776871168647
We inserted a 3-D endoscope into a jet laryngoscope and studied the pressure properties at the tip of the laryngoscope as well as intrapulmonary pressures while applying superimposed high-frequency jet ventilation.	0.9569722691262523
The studies were conducted initially using a lung simulator, and then in seven patients undergoing microlaryngeal surgery.	1.0483199469979323
Due to the rather large 3-D endoscope, the diameter of the jet laryngoscope was reduced by between 25.2% and 70.9%, depending on its size.	1.353317021063371
The measurements on the lung simulator revealed that reduction of laryngoscope diameter leads to an increase in the following parameters: expiratory resistance, tidal volume, and peak inspiratory pressure.	1.0661783768149158
The mean FiO2 was 0.74 +/- 0.1; the mean paO2 was 169.2 +/- 80.4 mm Hg; and the mean paCO2 was 40.9 +/- 2.4 mm Hg.	1.1953378273608983
The mean airway pressure was 19 +/- 5.3 mm Hg prior to insertion of the endoscope and 12.3 +/- 6.9 mm Hg after insertion.	1.0669317224100439
The mean positive end-expiratory pressure values increased from 2 +/- 0.6 to 3.6 +/- 2.3 mm Hg.	1.1888676475725113
Reduction of the working pressure resulted in restoration of the initial inspiratory pressures and tidal volumes.	0.9459728192822919
In the clinical application of 3-D endoscopy via a jet laryngoscope, it was possible to achieve sufficient ventilation, inspection of the surgical field, and performance of the surgical procedure.	1.222029683827813
A CO2 laser was used without changing the ventilation regime.	0.8051357217464492
Although technical alterations would be desirable for its application to microlaryngeal surgery, it is presently possible to safely use the 3-D endoscope via the jet laryngoscope for microlaryngeal surgery, presenting the surgeon with new possibilities in voice-improving microsurgery of the larynx.	1.0643774968183641
Kryopreserved specimens of cystic ducts were used for displacement tests to investigate the security of different laparoscopic clips.	0.9311890547746139
The cystic duct was fixed, and the transverse placed clips were distracted in axial direction and the forces registered.	1.0731768223944533
The median values of the six investigated clips ranged between 4.1 N and 11.2 N with a highly significant difference (P < 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA).	0.954182471173123
In detail, both resorbable clips (polydioxanone, polyglyconate/polyglycol acetate) were superior to the four titanium clips (P < 0.005, Wilcoxon test).	1.0362537663853577
In addition to the advantage of complete biodegradibility, these data favour the use of absorbable clips because holding force is better than that of titanium clips.	1.057695918611242
Hemoglobin solutions and fluorocarbon emulsions are evaluated as artificial oxygen carriers.	0.7072340044854873
The efficacy of hemoglobin solutions with respect to O2 transport and especially the effective O2 release to tissues has been demonstrated in a number of situations, such as extreme hemodilution and hemorrhagic shock.	1.0075829018986795
The hemoglobin molecule could be stabilized by genetic and chemical modifications.	0.774596709017915
This results in a clinically utilizable intravascular half-life of about 8-24 h, an adequate O2 affinity, and a lack of nephrotoxicity.	1.3297323058905266
A degree of vasoconstriction must be mentioned as the persistent side effect of the hemoglobin solutions evaluated here.	0.9113627130387272
In spite of this, hemoglobin solutions are also well tolerated in humans.	1.0229306097344373
Fluorocarbon emulsions are compounds with a very high gas solubility and are, therefore, well suited for the transport of O2 and CO2.	1.0169854498944433
The capacity for the release of O2 to the tissues is especially excellent.	0.8865821638414284
This was demonstrated under extreme hemodilution, during extracorporeal circulation and also under reanimation.	0.9410906584575134
Perflubron, the most important representative of the fluorocarbon emulsions, has also been successfully used in man and is well tolerated.	1.2537595222648112
The introduction of artificial oxygen carriers to clinical practice will greatly change transfusion medicine and also the acute care of trauma patients.	0.9631019285063226
Launch is expected within the next few years.	0.6177743326020059
The new volatile anaesthetic desflurane is characterized by very low blood-gas and tissue-blood partition coefficients, so that rapid induction of anaesthesia and shorter recovery times can be expected.	1.051695967791516
The aim of this investigation was to compare the effects of desflurane and isoflurane on haemodynamics and recovery time when used as part of a balanced anaesthesia technique for elective surgery.	1.013919161503496
In acute coronary syndromes, arteriosclerotic plaques are characterized by inflammation and decreased smooth muscle cell density.	0.8608140017095557
The underlying pathogenic processes remain unclear.	0.5474777199575216
Among others, increased programmed cell death (apoptosis) is postulated.	1.04742813872029
Coronary atherectomy specimens from 26 patients with unstable angina (group 1) and from 24 patients with stable angina (group 2) were examined, using immunohistochemistry (TUNEL test to detect fragmented DNA) and transmission electron microscopy.	1.200185260678878
The objectives of the present study were to evaluate plaque group differences in the cellular composition, to detect and quantify cell death, and to diferentiate between apoptosis and necrosis.	1.2567347827901518
On occasion of the 100th anniversary of heart surgery we present in this article the first successful experimental open heart operations in Russia in the years from 1926 to 1937.	1.0985715877491375
These operations on the stationary heart were carried out by using the first device for extracorporeal circulation.	0.9518611692517839
This work pioneered by Russian scientist S. Brukhonenko and the Surgeon N. Terebinski is nearly unknown to the medical public.	0.9620293107844222
The first and largest series at the time worldwide of more than 260 operations on the valves of the open heart, the still valid prophylactic procedure to avoid air embolism, and principles of open heart surgery stated by N. Terebinski were decades ahead of the development at the time.	1.137889304039784
In the authors' opinion they represent a milestone in the history of open heart surgery.	0.7652214666806598
Aneurysms of the temporal part of the carotid artery are unusually rare.	0.9912138738777737
The literature contains only a few previous reports dealing with hemorrhage from such malformations.	0.8879392945949998
In the present case massive bleeding occurred from a right-sided intrapetrous aneurym after myringotomy, which was performed as treatment for bilateral secretory otitis media.	1.2129344326945282
Due to the absence of any specific symptoms and the masking effect of middle ear glue preoperative identification of the aneurysm was not possible.	1.1793874139228626
Subsequent angiography showed the large fusiform extension of the intrapetrous aneurysm as well as multiple intracranial aneurysms.	0.8822704685107255
Leakage from the aneurism was closed definitively with muscle, fascia lata and a gelatin-resorcin-formalin-glue (Cardial).	0.7898195546218725
In order to apply the tissue patch the hypotympanic site of the aneurism was exposed using a posterior otosurgical approach.	0.895977528464157
Due to extensive intracranial collateralization to the vertebral arteries bleeding persisted even after ligation of both carotid arteries.	0.826246556394649
Temporary cardiac asystole was then induced to allow safe closure of the aneurysm.	0.7713189075663711
Following surgery the patient sustained loss of hearing in her ear and a partial peripheral facial palsy.	0.9449677954863669
Blindness causes human suffering and high social costs.	0.7210934005797797
Virtually all blind people are registered with the social services.	0.8389461607514274
Data from these institutions may help in (long-term) planning for blindness prevention.	1.033959152331301
The stage-oriented treatment of stem varicosis is the operation method of choice.	0.936138784068106
Nowadays, partial stem varicosis, which is an earlier stage of the disease, leads to operative treatment more frequently than 10 years ago; thus a sufficient vein stump remains after surgical treatment.	1.1851001979546587
After surgery on a group of 1000 patients, we examined the stumps for patency, the occurrence of varicose changes, for their availability in the long term, and the sufficiency of their length for aortocoronary or peripheral bypass surgery.	1.2319705925285054
The treatment of insufficient perforant veins was also included in the surgical therapy, as well as postoperative sclerotherapy of remaining lateral veins.	1.0143423558770275
With a follow-up period of up to 33 months postoperatively, the results show a high patency rate in the remaining stumps (97%), as well as a high sufficiency rate (94%), with a mean graft length of 29.4 cm.	1.271592515924543
Thus these stumps constitute a good natural graft for future vascular reconstructions.	0.7596398238784485
This study supports the call for the stage-oriented surgical treatment of stem varicosis.	0.9287027077812916
Background: Corneal HLA-DR antigens are going to be lost during organ culture storage.	1.1450009154208052
This study investigated if this phenomenon is based on down-regulation of the HLA-DR antigen, or on a loss of the HLA-DR-positive corneal Langerhans cells (LCs).	0.9066719178516957
The authors present a rare case of solitary non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in the skull of an 11-year-old girl.	1.1354754358916501
The clinical, radiological and histological findings as well as a review of the literature are included in this report.	1.2098452176579795
The morphological features of intra- and extracerebral tumor masses and the change in tumor extension due to chemotherapy and radiation therapy were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging.	1.0668917933373943
Although rare, NHL should be considered in the differential diagnosis of skull tumors in children.	0.8067377153570825
Neurodegenerative and dementing disorders such as Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease are among the most common diseases of advanced age.	0.896132770403317
Despite progress in the clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders, definite diagnosis for most of these disorders is still possible only by neuropathological examination of the brain.	1.1798889185195387
The neuropathological diagnosis and classification of neurodegenerative disorders has made clear advances in recent years, particularly due to the results of genetic and biochemical studies, resulting in the development of new disease-specific antibodies.	1.1394557805419223
Internationally recognized consensus criteria for most neurodegenerative disorders allow a definite and standardized diagnosis to be made.	0.793962096348946
To obtain further knowledge about the etiopathogenesis, particularly with regard to new therapeutic strategies, studies with clinically and neuropathologically well-documented cases are needed.	1.1504901545693231
The project "Brain-Net" has therefore been established with the aim of setting up a German Brain and Tissue Bank for Diseases of the Central Nervous System.	1.0065267778725404
The project is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research.	0.7908157810674761
Fetal surgery is defined as the intrauterine surgical correction of malformations that endanger the unborn child's life in prenatal stages of development or lead to death or severe damage of the child postnatally.	0.9941388363414859
Such surgery is a clinical reality now.	0.9566890434843929
Indications for intrataurine surgical procedures also exist for head and neck abnormalities, especially in the upper respiratory tract.	0.9940654269231081
These include exposure and temporary obstruction of the fetal trachea for correction of pulmonary hypoplasia in cases with congenital diaphragmatic hernias, prenatal tracheotomy in cases of laryngeal atresia for the correction of lethal pulmonary overdistension, and resection of embryonic tumors that obstruct the respiratory tract.	1.0129410096838931
The relatively high surgical risk resulting in particular from preterm labor occurring postoperatively may be reduced by employing minimally invasive techniques.	0.887445877803016
Endoscopic procedures render opening of the uterus unnecessary and are of particular importance.	0.8260828838884234
In part of the procedures, only endoscopic surgery has led to therapeutic success rates justifying its clinical use.	0.9471544353104513
Further reduction of the operative risk suggests prenatal interventions, even in cases with non-lethal conditions.	1.0917963168662899
More diseases of the head and neck may thus be included in the spectrum of indications.	0.864175176885817
One example is prenatal correction of a cleft lip and palate, which until now has only been performed in animal experiments.	1.1117307231581524
The particular characteristics of fetal wound healing allow this to take place without scarring up to a certain stage in pregnancy.	0.9687891088996889
This offers the prospect of a surgical correction that is invisible externally and avoids growth-impeding scars.	0.8435870248064403
The particular ethical and legal aspects of fetal surgery are discussed.	0.7606793395308747
We report on a 57-year-old patient suffering from a complex malposition of proximal femur after osteosynthesis using a condylar plate.	1.0347216758204711
For polyaxial correction of the proximal femur we successfully used an intramedullary hip screw system.	1.0180676644445994
In 6 patients with primary malignant bone tumors (4 Ewing, 1 recurrent Adamantinoma, 1 maligne Haemangioperizytoma) the local therapy was performed as intraoperative extracorporeal irradiation and replantation.	1.2445431479400955
During the follow-up 10 (6-24) months no local recurrence in the replanted segment occurred.	1.0921944231077452
One recurrence occurred in the host bed; in two cases the replanted segment had to be removed because of severe infection.	1.194938725747506
The other cases showed good functional and radiological results.	0.9093122713457955
These clinical findings and the reports in the literature seem to allow the application of the intraoperative extracorporeal irradiation and replantation procedure for defect reconstruction in cases of chemo- and radiotherapy-sensitive bone tumors.	1.114423273312127
Effects of anaesthesia and analgesia on postoperative morbidity and mortality remain controversial.	0.858423753402882
Numerous studies have demonstrated that epidural anaesthesia and pain relief by epidural analgesia reduces perioperative stress responses and thus may reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality.	1.0290287553529447
In patients undergoing vascular surgery, epidural anaesthesia diminished postoperative hypercoagulability.	0.8964512691942486
These patients may benefit from less thromboembolic complications as well as a reduced risk of a re-operation.	1.09662880151084
However, regional anaesthesia does not affect cardiopulmonary morbidity or overall mortality significantly in most clinical studies.	1.1460679066672146
One reason for this disappointing finding may be the missing integration of improved postoperative pain relief into general surgical care.	0.946592981425339
A multimodal therapeutic approach, which consists of preoperativ patient information, sufficient analgesia, early mobilisation and enteral feeding, may solve this discrepancy.	1.0619516179945403
Therefore, prospective controlled studies are needed to assess the influence of this perioperative approach on outcome.	1.2171075830986064
Although cerebrovascular diseases are the most common causes of dementia after Alzheimer's desease, vascular dementia (VD) has remained so far an ill-defined term.	1.1125016896918432
The main problems in the definition of VD arise from finding criteria for both terms "vascular" and "dementia".	0.9513717894077688
The detailed criteria for the diagnosis of VD proposed by several groups or institutions (ADDTC, DSM-IV, ICD-10, NINDS-ARIEN) are critically reviewed.	0.9587982377524136
The diagnostic value of some clinical findings, especially the very frequent white matter luciencies in CT (leuko-araiosis), are discussed.	1.1321231493279813
The available studies suggest a differentiation of VD into some subtypes (listed according to frequency): subcortical VD, VD with acute onset, multiinfarct-dementia, mixed types, and specific forms.	0.9648905696015944
Nevertheless, these subtypes give only little information about the etiology of the underlying vascular process and, therefore, no clear indication for specific therapeutic strategies.	1.3526344953479728
The aetiology of varicosis is still unclear.	0.5772895024575349
Investigation of changes in normal veins which result in the formation of varicosis led to examination of elastic properties and histomorphological alterations in the region of the extracellular matrix in the vessel wall of the long saphenous vein in normal and varicose veins.	1.0211099508556634
The rigidity of varicose veins was higher than that of normal veins; there was no difference between the varicose vein above a competent valve and the "normal" vein below this competent valve.	0.966951051429149
The matrix proteins demonstrated an increase in total fibres, whereas the elastic fibres were reduced and fragmented, explained the rigidity of varices.	1.0966650183391204
These results suggest that the role of the venous valves in the development of varicose veins is secondary to changes of the vein wall.	1.0539700355005994
An investigation of 122 knee joints was performed concerning the incidence and morphological characteristics of the meniscofemoral ligaments (MFL) Humphry and Wrisberg.	0.9604944756208057
Of the knees examined, 96% showed one or more ligaments, the incidence was independent of gender or age.	1.2097221440139112
The osseous parameters of the dorsal and ventral notch as well as the diacondylar width did not correlate with the incidence of MFL.	1.0707738432721
The ventral notch width index (NWI) after Souryal was 0.22 in females and 0.24 in males.	0.9175820832904722
A dorsal notch width index (dNWI), which has not been described so far, was 0.26 in females and 0.28 in males.	1.1566438087392108
The ligamentum meniscofemorale posterius (Wrisberg) showed distinct morphological variations.	0.8934964433817162
This resulted in a classification of type I-III.	1.0150922591845115
The results of the study underline the importance of the MFL for knee joint function including stabilization, proprioception, and meniscal positioning.	1.1315995651629642
Eleven patients with high-grade mucosal dysplasia in a columnar-lined oesophagus and 2 patients with a squamous carcinoma (uT1) underwent photodynamic therapy (PDT) and argon-plasma coagulation (APC).	1.1879680229544403
For PDT, 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) was given orally (60 mg/kg) and treated endoscopically with a light dose of 150 J/cm2 (100 mW/cm2) at 635 nm 4-6 h later.	1.2991011441606348
A second PDT was performed under the same conditions 2-3 weeks later.	1.0177939303527892
Patients who received APC were treated 4 times on average to reach radical Barrett mucosa eradication.	0.9097665580327825
All patients were consistently given medication to suppress acid production.	0.928774317637426
No complications occurred in either group.	0.32744016273516596
Follow-up endoscopies and multiple biopsies for 3-42 months showed squamous regeneration in the dysplastic columnar-lined oesophagus in all 11 patients.	0.986459810487558
Two patients with squamous carcinoma were found to have a recurrence 9 and 12 months later.	1.1954266219593241
PDT with 5-ALA-induced endogenous porphyrins, as well as APC combined with omeprazole protection, can eradicate superficial high-grade dysplastic mucosa in Barrett's oesophagus.	0.986061174776947
However, we did not succeed in destroying a manifest carcinoma.	1.2886594407566678
Technical advantages of spiral technology are of great usefulness in diagnostic imaging of thorax and abdomen in children.	0.9353658921991171
The rapid imaging time allows the examination of an entire organ while scanning with breath holding or while the child is quietly breathing, resulting in a decreased need for sedation.	0.9402111841625473
In addition especially examinations of the chest an to some extend CT-investigations of the abdomen are performed with reduced radiation dose achieved by reducing the tube loading.	1.0718648429755324
Radiation dose reduction of 70% is possible without loss of relevant diagnostic information.	1.0869060055429012
Spiral low-dose CT in pediatric chest imaging is useful in evaluating parenchymal lung diseases, mediastinal masses and central airway malformations.	0.9599674344237323
Whether abdominal helical CT can be replaced by MRI has to be decided in each individual case.	0.7731932701597445
When an exact protocol is used, sufficient contrast material given, scan-delay optimized and postprocessing reconstructions are performed, usefull additional diagnostic informations are obtained by the method.	0.9704003905162133
Invasive monitoring is a standard procedure in modern intensive care medicine.	1.1039016753960829
Despite significant progress in the routine use and catheter technology, there are relevant remaining risks concerning acute central venous and arterial access and chronic persistence of catheters within the vascular lumen.	1.0921347762814815
Resulting from the infectiologically established novel definition of antiseptic which contains the local application of antiseptics for prophylactical, preventive or therapeutical indication on skin, mucous membrane, wounds, in body cavities or on surgical exposed resp.	0.9525182344360055
opened endosomatic areas the antiseptical indications in a branch of dermatology and venereal diseases are represented.	0.8195538139977482
With the analysis of the actual knowledge in vitro and in vivo requirements to local antiinfectiva are defined combined with the recommendations for the clinical use.	1.1687686226636982
At present mainly prophylactically used agents are submitted to a benefit risk analysis with refer to the choice of agents.	0.8279542728249337
Thereby agents for the application on skin as well as on genitals, in mouth cavity and on wounds were taken into consideration.	1.1645964013635253
Hydatid disease, still frequent in endemic areas, is usually localized in the liver.	1.0940274429286014
Despite the benign nature of the disease it is one of the problematic fields of surgery due to the high complication rate and long hospital stay.	1.1712505616138262
Based on our experience we recommend evacuation of the cyst and omentoplasty as the surgical method of choice, as it is associated with a relatively low incidence of complications and can be performed easily.	1.2439146272482358
Background: Central catheters in neonatological intensive care patients are used for the prolonged application of medicataion or parenteral infusions.	1.235476938919836
Dislocations and septic and thromboembolic complications may occur.	0.6410359330539357
Low density lipoproteins are heterogeneous in particle size, density, and physical as well as chemical properties.	0.9141378083899935
Regarding size and density, LDL can be divided into two main profiles, LDL pattern A with elevated concentration of large, buoyant LDL particles and LDL pattern B with increased concentration of small, dense LDL particles.	0.9017368560262544
The latter is particularly expressed in insulin resistance and is associated with elevated serum triglycerides and reduced concentrations of HDL and particularly HDL2 cholesterol.	0.9225344995898591
The LDL profile of increased concentration of small, dense LDL particles has shown to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events.	0.8177904970902886
The LDL profile is partly genetically determined, but can be improved by non-pharmacological (exercise, diet) and pharmacological intervention.	1.1293770046891354
It remains to be confirmed whether the LDL subfraction profile is an independent lipid risk factor besides HDL2 cholesterol and triglycerides, but it is certainly a valuable indicator assessing metabolic cardiovascular risk.	1.0283145532176878
Traumatic injuries of arteries lead to acute bleeding or ischemia.	0.8192587501423642
In the hand, which is perfused by two arteries, this symptom could be missed.	1.414130974300728
The hypothenar hammer syndrome is a traumatic occlusion of the distal arteria ulnaris.	1.0314525508549728
Dependent on the mechanism of the trauma the clinical symptoms may appear late.	1.217717153434922
A specific angiographic or duplex sonographic diagnostic investigation is necessary to show the arterial occlusion.	0.9898065788639753
There is no proven therapeutic procedure.	0.844941927233976
Exact diagnosis of the occlusion as an effect of the trauma is important for the patient and is the basis of any therapeutic intervention.	1.407007234602826
The administration of epidural opioids is alternatively used in the management of postoperative analgesia.	0.9634425060542199
However, the administration is associated with side effects, including respiratory depression, somnolence and pruritus.	1.101345144384534
A rational opioid selection between the hydrophilic and lipophilic opioids morphine, hydromorphone, alfentanil, fentanyl and sufentanil is discussed in this mini-review.	0.9708370990317744
Thus, the administration of the lipophilic opioid sufentanil might has some advantages.	0.9727218779480814
Notwithstanding, epidural opioid administration alone offers no marked clinical advantages compared to the intravenous route.	0.911473739776332
In future, reduced doses of lipophilic opioids and local anaesthetics like bupivacaine 0.05-0.1% may provide benefits over the use of either drug alone and may offer marked clinical advantages over the intravenous route of opioids alone.	1.111920550984225
The same holds true for  2-adrenoceptor agonists as adjuvants.	0.8998282143129425
However, multicenter dose-ranging studies are necessary to determine both the ideal concentrations of the drug combinations and the general outcome.	1.2742883108732233
Moreover, we must also determine cost effectiveness for our postoperative analgesic techniques.	1.2384009932409161
Today the relevance of renal tumor embolization is not determined only by the technical and clinical success of the method.	1.0583072191459384
Progress in diagnosis of early stages of renal carcinomas as well as the improvement of both surgical techniques and anesthetic procedures have lead to a change in the selection of patients for embolization.	1.2075030128922166
Preoperative embolization of advanced renal cell carcinomas with tumor thrombus into the vena cava or of T4 tumors is now an established clinical procedure.	0.9185296241557748
The complete occlusion of the vascular bed of the tumors leads to a considerable reduction in intraoperative blood loss and to simplification of the surgical preparation.	1.1894454740839318
By using Ethibloc for embolization, palliation of a hemorrhage or of tumor-related pain in inoperable patients is usually successful.	0.9942051344118229
Although local control of the tumor disease, including complete tumor ablation, is achieved by embolization, the median survival rate of our palliatively embolized patients is only 3.5 months.	1.4226314281720063
This short life expectancy in the group of inoperable patients has to be acknowledged individually in patients considered for palliative embolization who are free of symptoms related to the tumor.	1.047477319972831
Purpose: To evaluate whether primary stenting is superior to balloon angioplasty (PTA) alone in the treatment of femoropopliteal obstructive disease.	1.0323780564087526
Content of this paper is the current state of the art of robots in surgery and the ongoing work on the field of surgical robotics at the Clinic for Maxillofacial Surgery at the Charité.	1.0705370021568699
Robots in surgery allows the surgeon to transform the accuracy of the imaging systems directly during the intervention and to plan an intervention beforehand.	1.0762479671815333
In this paper firstly the state of the art is described.	1.0898945140278438
Subsequently the scientific work at the clinic is described in detail.	0.8458015660765191
The paper closes with a outlook for future applications of robotics systems in maxillofacial surgery.	0.7254247553286284
Giant-cell bone tumors display a locally aggressive growth pattern, frequently recur if no adjuvant treatment is given, and may potentially metastasize.	1.0143866699000486
By virtue of their biological behavior and typically juxta-articular localization, giant-cell bone tumors require specific surgical management.	0.890086425697833
Thus, an intralesional tumor excision must be supplemented by adjuvant bone cementing, possibly combined with instillation of phenol or cryotherapy.	1.0031901455340706
These combined treatment modalities assure a high-quality procedure, defined as the actual way medical care is delivered, by promoting the quality of the outcome, defined as the effect of a medical procedure on the patient's state of health.	1.1584245294024822
We report two patients with partial trisomy of the long arm of chromosome 7 and partial monosomy of the short arm of chromosome 17.	0.9702935257167487
Chromosomal analysis of the family shows a familial balanced translocation of the chromosomes 7 and 17 in the parents and other relatives.	1.0198539927910037
Pedigree analysis reveals abortions, frequent miscarriages and early infant deaths.	0.6908186794952336
Our patients show the same chromosomal abnormality and nearly the same clinical symptoms: prominent forehead, hydrocephalus internus with wide cranial sutures and fontanels, hypertelorism, cleft soft palate, low set dysmorphic ears, psychomotor retardation and micrognathie.	0.9429090152128233
Renal cell carcinomas (RCC) are endowed with impressive metastatic potential.	0.8213760204633389
Patients with RCC who present with apparently solitary metastatic lesions represent a small cohort.	0.7578741557393861
Due to the different long-term results achieved with surgical resection of metastatic RCC lesions, a generally accepted judgement about this treatment modality is not possible.	1.25381136341382
Several studies suggest that aggressive surgical management can provide an effective treatment, especially in patients with solitary pulmonary metastases.	0.9986602460686502
Most noteworthy is the fact that because of the organ distribution of RCC metastases, surgical therapy is dominated by general and thoracic surgeons, neurosurgeons, and orthopaedic surgeons.	1.0813118436509408
Therefore, an interdisciplinary approach is one of the most important key points for a successful outcome in these patients.	1.2646107814802208
The term Langerhans cell histiocytosis, previously "Histiocytosis X", encompasses three different syndromes: eosinophilic granuloma of bone, Hand-Schüller-Christian disease and Abt-Letterer Siwe disease.	0.9626564753847884
All are rare manifestations in childhood.	0.6620567502563681
We report on a 10 year old boy presenting with a swelling in the occipital region and clinical signs of elevated intracranial pressure.	1.0703664278573444
The tentative diagnosis after examination, conventional radiologic procedures and computerized tomography was eosinophilic granuloma.	0.8737240643447847
Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance imaging-angiography revealed the acute threat to the child caused by the intracranial expanding mass lesion with almost complete obstruction of the confluens sinuum.	1.0672773544650294
Thrombosis and the risk of bleeding were decreased by early and complete exstirpation of the tumor.	0.9261596196135449
After two years follow-up, no new lesions had appeared.	1.1376050232561674
The diffuse angiomatosis of the spleen is a rare splenic proliferation.	0.9142350381478828
Spontaneous rupture is the main, potentially lethal complication, found in 25 % of cases.	1.0777040749443394
The problem with these vascular tumors is preoperative diagnosis, because they are asymptomatic for a long time.	0.9949743124512119
First-choice therapy is limited resection.	0.8695773806960716
In the case of rupture, splenectomy is a life-saving procedure.	1.067903152737165
We report on a 56-year-old woman with a spontaneous splenic rupture as the first symptom of diffuse angiomatosis of the spleen.	0.9772668187346168
Exceptional features of splenic hemangiomas, causes of spontaneous rupture and the therapy are described.	0.9666869765332105
The hypothesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as a T cell mediated disease has led to the development of numerous therapeutic approaches that target the function of T cells.	0.9902968782620815
The development of monoclonal antibodies against the T cell surface molecule CD4 has raised hopes to achieve a major progress in the treatment of RA.	1.033560434585493
However, after encouraging results in early open studies, double blind trials were unable to demonstrate the efficacy of anti-CD4-therapy in RA.	1.2139634688055831
There are numerous reasons to explain the failure of this treatment approach.	1.0362315784594023
Besides the fact that the T cell hypothesis of RA has  repeatedly been challenged, pharmacological problems or an inappropriate selection of outcome criteria have to be considered.	0.9603841912113746
The final evaluation of anti-CD4 therapy  in RA will be possible only after  the testing of newly developed  non-depleting anti-CD4 anti- bodies.	1.0440579659456084
Purpose: For some time, the ambulatory diagnosis of respiratory disturbances during sleep has included the use of seven-channel recording units.	1.182194406385285
One of these systems is the POLY-MESAM unit (MAP, Germany).	0.9642252361203937
Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) function as transducers of information across the cell membrane by coupling receptors to effectors.	0.9664112082023587
A large number of G protein-linked receptors funnel extra-cellular signals as diverse as hormones, growth factors, neurotransmitters, and primary sensory stimuli through a set of G proteins to a small number of second-messenger systems.	0.9092017354717256
The G proteins act as molecular switches with an "on" and "off" state governed by a GTPase cycle.	0.9878858019838276
By virtue of its high affinity and specificity for guanine nucleotide binding and its intrinsic GTPase activity, the -subunit of the G protein (G) plays the critical role in regulation of the effectors by their corresponding G protein.	1.1231593603921817
Mutations of G may result in either constitutive activation or loss of expression mutations.	0.7877277383894019
Given the variety of functions subserved by G protein-coupled signal transduction, it is not surprising that abnormalities in G protein-coupled pathways can lead to diseases with manifestations as dissimilar as blindness, hormone resistance, precocious puberty and neoplasia.	0.8828640516514935
For a given defect in a G protein-coupled pathway, the extent of the manifestations will also be determined by the cellular distribution of the affected component.	1.1254745262468786
Defects in components expressed exclusively in a single cell type will cause more a focal disorder than defects in a widely expressed component, particularly in germline mutations (e.g., Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy), whereas somatic mutations of genes encoding even an ubiquitously expressed component can cause focal disease when the somatic mutation itself is focal (e.g., McCune-Albright syndrome).	1.0063896749682495
Mivacurium is a short-acting, nondepolarising muscle relaxant of the benzylisoquinoline type that undergoes rapid breakdown by plasma cholinesterase.	0.8090882407635628
After 2.5 times the ED95 (0.2 mg/kg), tracheal intubation can be accomplished within 2-3 min following injection.	1.2012548809984074
The ensuing DUR 25% (i.e., time from injection to 25% recovery of control twitch tension) is three times as long as with succinylcholine.	1.2214748843828078
The principal side effects of mivacurium are facial flushing and a transient fall in blood pressure due to moderate histamine release following doses 3-4 times the ED95.	0.9976483145845535
In patients with end-stage liver or renal disease as well as those with atypical plasma cholinesterase, the duration of action of mivacurium is prolonged.	1.017009491078387
The performance of new cryoprobes was studied by measuring the spatial and temporal patterns of the temperature distribution in liver tissue around one to three active cryoprobes.	0.9630629118233932
After 15 min of maximal freezing a tissue region 22 mm in diameter was frozen to temperatures below - 50  °C by one active cryoprobe.	0.9304393529258713
With three cryoprobes, using the synergistic cooling effect, a tissue region 45 mm in diameter was cooled to temperatures below - 50  °C.	1.0335935450948326
Optimal placement of the cryoprobes was found to be of critical importance.	1.065883846357774
Attachment representation was assessed in 48 elderly people with an average age of 69 years.	0.9514635782816505
The adult attachment interview was used plus an additional question about wishes for the future.	0.805071473895998
Coherent correlations with subjective life satisfaction and individual future perspective were demonstrated.	0.724022979191282
Elderly participants with secure attachment representation were more satisfied, they were also less anxious, and more often positive about their future.	1.170986119381788
If their adult children had secure attachment representation, they were reported by their elderly parents to be socially, emotionally, and materially more supportive.	1.0517886759147173
Magnetic resonance imaging represents today the most important tool in neuroradiology for both clinical pratice and research.	1.0107582483839002
MRI allows imaging of the human body in 2 or 3 dimensions with variable tissue contrast.	1.092131920285764
The natural diffusion of tissue protons can now be used as a supplementary contrast mechanism.	0.8940463180606755
Different MRI techniques can be used to obtain clinically useful diffusion-weighted images.	0.840104651164414
These techniques all require the use of strong gradient pulses in order to obtain the diffusion contrast.	0.9649781842903261
In the current article, the most important physical principles of diffusion measurement are presented.	1.195949256632594
After a short introduction into the basic physical principles, we will present the prerequisites and limitations of clinically relevant applications today.	1.0910477032454433
Finally a few select examples of clinical use of these techniques in the acute diagnosis of stroke will be presented.	1.1500955563453652
The effects of chronical strains on physical or psychological health are subject of this paper.	0.8782434803076636
Stress-related symptoms of family caregivers of dementia patients have been proven in various studies.	1.0423337666850163
For this group of people an analysis of the health risc factors is regarded as to be especially important.	1.0685437362497971
Diary investigations allow to identify the individual assessment (by the caring person) of factors related to the care situation and to recognize the health and quality of sleep have been used as indicators regarding the state of health.	1.230394330610639
In this study strong differences in the individual view of stress factors and their effects on psychological an physical state of the caring person are shown.	1.1312247435071052
The causes of residual deformity with posttraumatic painful arthritis after tarsometatarsal (Lisfranc) fracture-dislocation with the need for correctional arthrodesis are in our experience (22 cases over 5 years) overseen injuries in one third, closed reduction and immobilisation or inadequate fixation technique with K-wires in another two thirds of cases.	1.097917711425501
Foot malalignment and residual instability is assessed with weight-bearing radiographs of both feet, adduction/abduction stress films and CT scans for complex deformity.	0.9119928736366453
Correction is carried out via two longitudinal dorsal incisions, strict epiperiosteal preparation and debridement of the Lisfranc joint of all remaining cartilage, sclerosis and fibrous tissue.	0.7960952335805959
Reorientation begins, in the same manner as primary open reduction, with anatomical alignment of the second metatarsal base to the second cuneiform.	1.284900236968399
Defects are filled with autologous bone grafting, stable fusion can be achieved with 3.5 mm cancellous compression screws.	1.1282052467135824
Full weight bearing is allowed in a modelled plaster shoe for 6 to 8 weeks.	0.8300701042186736
The functional medium-term results are convincing with 15 of 17 patients seen after 13 months of follow-up working full time.	1.0171324836653024
The Maryland Foot Score improved from 38.9 to 76.8 points in these patients.	0.9541282121222682
The author of this paper deems it very necessary to rename Chinese Tuina, a traditional Chinese medical subject, so as to make Chinese Tuina conform to recent research results and formulation, as well as to combine Chinese Tuina with Western manual medicine at the clinic.	1.0463547502390196
This paper is the result of my research during the period of time was in Switzerland working together with Prof. Jiri Dvorak.	0.9794423157532155
The operability of a liver tumour depends on its three-dimensional relation to the intrahepatic vascular trees which define autonomously functioning liver (sub-)segments.	1.054512474716464
The aim of our study was to establish a computer-based three-dimensional volumetric operation planning system for the liver.	1.1166508690493444
Methods: Using data from routine helical CT scans the three tissue subclasses of liver parenchyma, liver vessels and liver tumour were segmented semiautomatically.	1.1094258302568691
A dedicated segmenting tool was established using region growing algorithms in combination with an "intelligent" border finder.	0.8658769447996107
Visualisation is performed by the "Heidelberg Raytracer".	0.8717865294125579
The vascular trees are visualised as 3D graphs.	0.6906348665740009
Pseudoconnections between portal and hepatic venous trees are separated automatically.	0.7096257671930769
Security margins are calculated and the system presents a virtual resection proposal.	0.8081430014877723
Results: The 3D anatomy of the liver can be visualised in high quality resulting in good depth perception.	1.097542420129032
Dependent liver parenchyma can be recognised automatically on the basis of the vascular trees.	1.115170564915637
The system offers a individualised resection proposal including the tumour, security margin and dependent liver parenchyma.	0.8089544312903229
Conclusion: Three-dimensional presentation of the individual liver anatomy of a given patient facilitates the perception of the pathology.	1.3207856422421813
Virtual reality combined with artifical intelligence allows calculation of complete resection protocols, which can be quantified and modified interactively.	0.8834407330465669
This will make operation planning more objective; patient selection may be improved, and in cases of difficult tumour localisation different resection strategies may be tested.	1.0967578476733733
Thus virtual reality in liver surgery will improve teaching, surgical training and planning.	0.9354245438472522
It may lead to improved surgical care.	0.6117243712594888
Methods to predict the rate of spontaneous relapses in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic agents are missing.	0.9104276917368713
P-wave signal averaging might be helpful in this setting.	0.9310516570525628
However, correct validation and standardization is strongly needed for p-wave analysis with the high resolution ECG.	1.3218320811948903
Signal averaging triggered to the p-wave is significantly superior to QRS-triggering.	0.8604317872325474
Bidirectional filtering or FIR-filtering is necessary.	0.5682110735088686
The data indicate significant differences in p-wave duration between patients with and without paroxysmal artrial fibrillation.	0.893389295948442
Class I antiarrhythmic agents demonstrate a significant prolongation of p-wave duration, but did not influence spectral parameters.	1.0399449457226373
Treatment with sotalol reduces high frequency p-wave energy without altering p-wave duration.	0.8842030825468242
After optimizing the methods, p-wave analysis offers promise to separate patients prone to atrial fibrillation and normals.	1.0844378834617603
In addition, the evaluation of antiarrhythmic efficacy in patients with high risk of recurrent atrial fibrillation might be possible.	1.171314502225105
In the majority of cases right atrial or ventricular thrombi represent pulmonary emboli in transit.	0.8878582807827881
These may be fatal in patients treated conservatively with anticoagulation only.	1.2142141052135609
In literature the incidence of right heart thrombi in patients with proven pulmonary embolism is said to be in the range of 3 - 4%.	1.2215198032655354
Extremely mobile, long, worm-shaped masses in the right heart cavities carry an especially high early thrombus-related mortality rate which ranges from 30 - 40%.	1.0874984516607697
Current therapeutic strategies favour fibrinolytic therapy with consecutive anticoagulation.	0.778901530405461
In the last years, several studies addressed the role of the different antithrombotic therapeutics in unstable angina pectoris.	1.1893905618233052
Acetylsalicylic acid still is the standard treatment reducing the rate of death and myocardial infarction by 50% in the first six months.	1.2383179827223472
Ticlopidin has no clinical effect in the first six days and therefore is not suited for treatment in the acute phase.	1.2244304330953453
Unfractionated heparin has an additional favourable effect when added to aspirin.	0.7152371958795588
Low molecular weight-heparin is at least as effective as UF-heparin.	0.8479808286124159
Direct thrombin-inhibitors (hirudin, hirudin-analoga) seem to be comparable to UF-heparin.	0.7976715709864644
Pasminogen-activators should not be given in unstable angina, as they show a tendency to worsen the clinical outcome.	1.139342317562676
GP IIb/IIIa-antagonists (antibodies, synthetic antagonists) significantly improve the clinical effects of aspirin.	0.9498906642616626
When combined with a reduced dose of heparin, their favourable effect remains unchanged, while bleeding complications are reduced to a minimum.	1.1541332546024246
The study presents data on cardiovascular malformations in Bavarian livebirths, born between 1984 and 1991.	0.8148103809642833
Cases have been ascertained retrospectively by reviewing hospital records of all children being referred to a children's hospital up to 2 years of age.	0.9426088347240392
The classification scheme was based on abnormalities in developmental mechanisms.	0.7803660323231469
Severe dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa with oral involvement often leads to dental destruction and restricted food intake, resulting in malnutrition and maldevelopment.	0.8016922764847304
The patients become handicapped and have a poor prognosis.	0.6484425899976451
We report on a now 13-year-old Turkish child with normal secondary dentition who had severely damaged primary dentition.	1.0855894171826244
The teeth were treated surgically and then by continuous dental hygiene measures over the next 7 years.	0.975955736323675
This care also resulted in an improvement in the nutritional state, associated anemia and the incidence of skin infections.	0.9796910658774656
Although cutaneous blistering and scarring has been progressive, with resulting mutilation of the fingers, the child is socially well adjusted in school and family.	1.0730664080090668
Its clinical course demonstrates that the fate of patients with severe dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa can be improved through multidisciplinary management.	1.0425119052377232
Our understanding of ulcer pathogenesis has dramatically changed since the discovery of Heliobacter pylori.	0.7530108132700529
Peptic ulcer is now recognized as a chronic gastric infectious disease.	0.8024680121128088
H. pylori can be considered the pacemaker, with other known risk factors ultimately contributing to the ulcer formation.	1.2348697047048474
Treatment of H. pylori in peptic ulcer disease cures the acute lesion and prevents relapse and complications.	0.8837358456776725
In clinical management a positive diagnosis of H. pylori is required and other potential causes for ulcer formation must be excluded before starting treatment.	1.0110972619165157
The standard treatment in H. pylori positive ulcer consists of PPI in standard dose and two antibiotics either clarithromycin 2 x 500 mg and amoxycillin 2 x 1 g or metronidazole 2 x 400 mg and clarithromycin 2 x 250 mg (or 500 mg) for 7 days.	1.0301553473591665
The simultaneous presence of H. pylori and NSAID intake requires distinct management.	0.831035536552193
Following bleeding complication a PPI needs to be given beyond 7 days until ulcer healing is endoscopically confirmed.	0.8435656326444059
We present the results of a study conducted in collaboration with the German workers' board to monitor the effectiveness of treatment in 477 cases.	1.311861174540026
The examiners reviewed the charts of patients who had suffered distorsion or luxation of the knee, fractures of the spine with or without neural deficits, calcaneus fractures, rotator cuff lesions and shoulder luxation, and fractures of the acetabulum and pelvis as the result of accidents.	1.2375779891753282
A new documentation sheet was desiged to note administrative and medical data.	0.7140574829441786
All 477 patients' charts and X-rays were reviewed by three trauma surgeons, and procedures were monitored in a prospective manner.	1.1538773679370558
The study revealed considerable discrepancies between the assumed injuries and those ultimately found to have been sustained, especially in the case of knee injuries.	1.0861725733598608
The article reveals the results concerning the validity of the diagnosis and the need for more precisely tailored diagnostic methods for different patient groups.	1.1087365033774945
Our final conclusion is that it is necessary to implement new paths of patient management and better steering features to improve both the quality of medical care and the administrative procedures in place.	1.0553414023513692
A workshop on attenuated cold-adapted influenza virus vaccines (CAIV) was organized in Langen, Germany on December 16-17, 1998 by Prof. Reinhard Kurth, President of the Paul Ehrlich Institute.	0.9547096928513068
Reperfusion injury has become a scientific problem of increasing importance, in part because of recent developments of thrombolytic therapy.	1.0964088292165715
The mechanisms of reperfusion injury following focal cerebral ischemia, however, are not known in detail.	1.1237603359715824
Recent studies strongly suggest that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium overload play an important role in reperfusion injury and that pharmacological interventions against calcium- or free radical-mediated damage could extend the therapeutic window in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.	0.9944499688515434
The mediators involved are known to induce a mitochondrial permeability transition (PT) during the reperfusion period, which is associated with uncoupling of mitochondrial respiration, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and a burst production of ROS, leading to cellular death.	1.140868877642046
The mitochondrial PT is considered to be a key process in reperfusion injury following cerebral ischemia, as also observed in other organs such as heart and liver.	1.0903171608401432
Pharmacological modulation of mitochondrial permeability changes have the potential to reduce tissue damage due to reperfusion.	0.9577107694670526
We performed an open clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of a 1 µg/h ganciclovir implant for the treatment of newly and pretreated cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).	0.9428147585651654
The purpose of this study was to compare the initial stiffness of two techniques for posterior interbody lumbar fusion (PLIF) by a finite element approach.	0.983006442919127
Thus a finite element model of a human L3/4 spinal segment was generated.	0.8496748449343986
Stiffness of the intact model was tested under compression (600 N), torsion (25 Nm) and shearing forces (250 N) without preload.	1.3077680096256656
The results were compared to the stiffness following simulation of PLIF with two BAK-Cages and PLIF with two Harms-Cages and additional posterior screw-rod-osteosynthesis.	0.8315865829930603
PLIF with two BAK-Cages resulted in a loss of stiffness in compression, torsion and shearing.	0.5836396553860821
PLIF with two Harms-Cages and posterior osteosynthesis resulted in an increase of stiffness in compression, torsion and shearing.	0.7026854087772605
Tramadol, an analgesic with mean potency one tenth that of morphine is used regularely for the treatment of chronic and postoperative pain.	1.1307077902943277
Previous reports have indicated that tramadol may induce seizure activity when given together with a selective serotonine reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).	0.8022136903085665
Therefore, its major mode of action may be questioned which purportedly is due to binding with the opioid receptor and partly due to the inhibition of monoamine reuptake.	1.1129364826316808
Aim: The cause of a connatal hemiplegia was retrospectivly investigated in children born at term.	0.9812532380842538
The article gives a short review on the history of the field.	0.9814374972607881
First forensic cases were solved by the use  of medicocriminal entomology in the thirteenth century but the method has only developed to a professional level over the last 100 years.	1.0178520540372626
In Europe, mainly French, Belgian, English and Scandinavian researchers have been responsible for maintaining the methods.	0.8343835119183498
In France, an entomological police laboratory has been set up in Rosny-sous-bois.	0.8516434444282304
In contrast to the United States of America where entomological evidence is accepted by the courts, the method has only just started to be accepted in Germany.	1.106809285302574
Initially cooperation with the police and with judges might help to establish the analysis of arthropods as a routine tool in forensic science for Germany.	1.0019016733001638
27 patients with sternocostoclavicular hyperostosis (SCC) and/or pustulotic arthroosteitis (PAO) were examined with whole body scintigraphy, conventional radiography, and other imaging modalities, such as CT, MRI.	1.1370944389456292
25 of 27 patients with SCCH showed a characteristic high bullhorn-like uptake of the sternocostoclavicular region with the manubrium sterni representing the skull and the inflamed sternocostoclavicular joints corresponding to the horns (=bullhorn-sign).	0.9135426660758815
Scintigraphy revealed additional skeletal manifestations (spondylitis, sacroiliitis, osteitis, periostitis) in 19 of the 27 patients with SCCH and/or PAO.	0.950973842709059
In combination with PPP or psoriasis pustulosa, the typical scintigraphic bullhorn pattern enables the diagnosis of PAO (19 patients) with high confidence.	1.2567314940555934
Patients with SCCH but without skin disease at the time of presentation (8 of 27 patients) may develop PPP later and, therefore, it is justified to classify them as incomplete PAO with high risk to develop other skeletal manifestations later in the course of the disease.	1.1520604528649345
PADAM stands for partial androgen deficiency in the aging male, and it is currently diagnosed with a testosterone level below 3 ng/ml (300 ng/dl or 12 nmol/l), and with symptoms varying according to the individual.	1.1783775105013286
The symptoms are a reduction or even loss of libido, a decline in muscle mass and strength, enhancement of visceral fatty tissue-padding, dryness of the skin, apathy, tiredness and distortion of mood right up to depression, and ostalgia due to osteoporosis.	1.0147863634051855
A 34 year-old pregnant woman presented with reticulate pigmentation of the flexures, the dorsum of the hands and the genitoperianal region.	1.1008541972582242
She was in good health and her family history was unremarkable.	0.8617769003741632
Histologic examination of the hyperpigmented patches revealed pigmented filiform downgrowths of the interfollicular epidermis and follicular infundibula, as well as small epithelial cysts.	0.8177286112278692
Upon immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies, the number of melanocytes appeared normal.	0.9252793404938405
The elongated dendritic processes of the melanocytes contained many mature melanosomes.	0.7128533743824885
In the adjacent keratinocytes large melanosomes did not aggregate into complexes.	0.7373797283388392
The diagnosis of localized reticulate pigmentary disorder was established.	0.8645487952383151
The knowledge of the broad clinical spectrum of localized reticulate hyperpigmentations with its favorable prognosis is of practical importance.	0.8635541052206912
Genital or flexural pigmented lesions have to be differentiated from melanosis of the vulva or acanthosis nigricans.	0.8041265970952791
The presented case gives further evidence that many of the proposed entities characterized clinically by reticulate pigmented macules and hyperkeratotic follicular lesions are different phenotypic expressions of the same autosomal dominant genodermatosis.	0.9517458954332496
Purpose: During the last few years there has been an increasing interest in evaluating quality of life (QOL) data regarding surgical treatment.	1.2659143961871526
Methods: The present study comments the efficacy of laparoscopic antireflux surgery after required Nissen fundoplication of 70 patients.	1.104451865021922
Therefore, the German Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) was used to query the patients preoperatively and three times after surgery up to 1 year.	1.1718545253544017
Results: Preoperatively, we found a low general GIQLI score (mean 92.7 points), which increased 6 weeks postoperatively (116.8 points), 3 months (124.8) and 1 year (mean 123.9 points) significantly and is now comparable to the healthy population (122.6 points).	1.3532094298662052
Conclusion: It is our opinion that the efficacy of the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease with required Nissen fundoplication can also be documented and discussed by using QOL.	1.3333809015535827
Introduction: Serous cystadenomas of the pancreas are rare tumors and thought to be almost always benign.	1.2558399589246145
Methods: We report our experience in the diagnosis and surgical treatment of 12 patients with these tumors.	1.3145914571888029
Results: Between October 1993 and December 1998, 41 patients with cystic tumors of the pancreas underwent surgical resection; in 12 cases (11 women, 1 man) a serous cystadenoma (10 micrcocystic, 2 oligomacrocystic) was found.	1.3303435978638103
Only 6 (50 %) patients had symptoms.	1.2950056699158066
The mean tumor size was 4.8 (2.7-10) cm.	1.374875344744919
Ultrasound, CT and MRT usually could detect the mass, but differentiation with other cystic lesions was not reliable.	1.1079748163954342
All tumors were resected: 4 Whipple procedures, 7 distal pancreatectomies and 1 segmental resection were performed.	1.0007145090943343
No patient died after surgery and none had to be reoperated on.	0.9310115640716365
Conclusions: Because of the difficulty in reliably differentiating benign and malignant lesions of the pancreas, we believe that cystic tumors of the pancreas should be resected.	1.1082597000201588
We examined the prevalence of HIV-associated cutaneous disorders as well as the frequency and efficiency of UV-radiation in HIV-infected patients by evaluating the clinical records of 1310 patients seen between and 1994 and 1996.	1.1983006589951215
41 patients were treated with UVB-radiation and 4 patients with UVA1-radiation, while three patients received PUVA-therapy.	1.0454152559663497
UV-radiation proved to be efficient and safe in the treatment of pruritic papular eruption, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.	0.9517264314519226
Although some in vitro studies and studies with transgenic mice have suggested a negative impact of UV radiation on the immunosystem of HIV-positive patients, no progression of the HIV infection due to phototherapy has been proven.	1.0759932454109458
The staff at interventional radiological procedures is exposed to high levels of ionizing radiation.	0.702646634229487
This applies especially to measures at cardiac catheterization laboratories.	0.7040296821774537
In this study the annual radiation exposure to the staff was estimated by measuring the dose rate under characteristic conditions.	1.0657201304929276
It could be shown that the resulting radiation exposure was strongly dependent on the radiation protection measures and is also dependent on the operation conditions of the x-ray tube.	0.9974600343176857
The effective dose for the physician wearing a lead apron and thyroid shield was detremined to about 1.7 mSva.	1.0119200500695646
Without a thyroid shield an effective dose of about 3.5 mSva resulted.	0.9521638872119486
This corresponds to approximately the natural background radiation of about 2.4 mSva in the Federal Republic of Germany.	0.9189457215600866
From the number of procedures performed we could derive an effective dose of approximately 1-2 µSv per application for the physician, averaged over all types of procedures.	0.9868028208980169
Further, it could be shown that the readings of the film badges, usually worn by the staff, underestimate the effective dose by approximately a factor of two.	1.0480835564338116
This is because the film badges do not include the contribution of the unshielded parts of the body to effective dose.	0.9987055730210203
From the estimated annual effective dose, a lifetime dose of 68 mSv was estimated for a 40-year working career.	0.9710747482959582
The corresponding lifetime risk for induced fatal cancer due to radiation exposure was determined to 0.3% applying the ICRP risk factor of 4  -  10-2 Sv-1.	1.1384237366360581
Considering the NCRP recommendations for a safe occupation, working in a cardiac catheterization laboratory can be considered as safe when applying all radiation protection measures.	1.0167922954453545
However, changing the protection measures and modifying the parameters of the x-ray-tube can lead to strong changes of the radiation exposure and the resulting risk estimation.	1.1807252341755654
Treatment of pulmonary hypertension is an important issue in intensive care.	0.9856755869643559
One therapeutic regimen involves the intravenous administration of prostacyclin (PGI2).	0.7567444626051019
This, however, is accompanied by diminished hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, reduced arterial oxygenation, and systemic vasodilation.	1.0960394487744982
Thus, its clinical usefulness is limited.	1.2976965817184842
However, the inhalation of vasodilators such as nitric oxide (NO) or nebulized PGI2 causes a selective pulmonary vasodilation in ventilated alveoli and improved gas exchange, without any systemic vasodilation.	0.9990251635693439
It has therefore gained importance for the treatment of pulmonary failure associated with high shunt fractions.	1.0776949632726858
However, the inhalation of vasodilators may have adverse effects: in the case of NO, toxic side effects are predominant (MetHb, NOx), whereas in the case of PGI2, technical problems in terms of dosing and administration safety are of major interest.	1.2193302990178991
Furthermore, some patients do not respond to the treatment.	1.3036944024526296
In some individuals a reduction in pulmonary hypertension can be seen, while others lack even pulmonary vasodilation.	1.0619802664234632
The exact pathophysiological mechanisms remain to be investigated.	0.6414502270188556
The treatment of infrarenal aortic aneurysms by means of transluminally placed endovascular prostheses reflects significant progress in the field of vascular surgery.	0.8711603924701964
In the case of infrarenal aortic aneurysm it is possible to achieve technically successful implantation of such a prosthesis in well over 90 % of cases.	1.1313270694809545
The rate of clinical success, meaning lasting effective exclusion of the aortic aneurysm, cannot (yet) be definitively determined, since no long-term results are so far available.	1.148398895411164
Secondary leaks are observed in at least 10 % of all patients, making a further therapy necessary (endorepair, conversion, embolization).	1.0303096760393198
Further development of endovascular prostheses will include optimization of the aortal/iliac attachment of the prostheses, a better configuration and the development of long-lasting materials that can be used for endovascular prostheses.	1.1440005745986819
The frequency of postspinal headaches after accidental puncture of the subarachnoid space with 16 - 18 G Tuohy needles is reported at 59 - 85%.	1.040990445595702
A case of postspinal headache syndrome persisting over a period of 6 weeks following epidural anaesthesia during labour is described.	0.9427988831963618
A 30-year-old women had severe postspinal headache for 6 weeks after epidural anaesthesia during labour.	0.9630209047698486
Conservative therapy for 3 days and 4 days of bedrest followed by cristalloid infusions during a 3-week hospital stay and a subsequent 3-week period of bedrest at home did not lead to lasting pain relief.	1.0671871937506978
Intracranial haematoma and other abnormal processes were excluded by CCT.	0.7569944564984684
A pathologic EEG was not confirmed by cranial MRT.	0.7158034469022742
A lumbar epidural blood patch of 15 ml of autologous blood was performed at L3/4.	0.9315299906260406
The patient stayed in bed for 12 h. After 3 h free of pain the patient complained of recurring headache.	1.0612370776835502
After a further 48 h of bedrest she had recovered.	0.7967014351217441
Because of lumbar pain 4 days after the epidural blood patch a MRT was performed, which showed the blood at L4 to S3 in the epidural space.	1.0360419546896822
The diagnosis of a cerebrospinal fluid leakage was based on the history and the main symptom of postspinal headache: the pain onset in the supine position.	1.212916488506039
Such possible treatments as diminishing subarachnoidal pressure by bedrest, increasing cerebrospinal fluid production by infusions, increasing epidural pressure by epidural infusions and closing the cerebrospinal fluid leakage by epidural blood patch are discussed.	0.8994779600006084
The average success rate with the epidural blood patch is 93%.	0.8340986961762539
Volumes ranging from 5 to 20 ml are discussed for the autologous blood.	0.9098821065857193
We chose 15 ml of blood, to take account of the possibility that blood might settle in the wide sacral space.	1.008138790788413
We were able to document the position of the blood patch as L4 to S3 on MR tomography (the injection site was L3/4).	1.0707285675351057
Most patients are free of headache 1 h after epidural blood patch.	0.8600169574097065
Our patient had to be confined to bed for another 48 h because of recurring headache.	0.7836734149750154
The blood patch alone was not immediately sufficient to prevent all further cerebrospinal fluid leakage.	0.9137458452805384
Probably more than one subarachnoidal puncture had been made during the difficult epidural anesthetic procedure.	0.9792740787170652
On the other hand, the leak was probably only diminished because of the blood patch descending down to the wide sacral space.	0.986927998976651
The combination of the large-volume blood patch, which diminished the leakage, and conservative treatment, which narrowed the transdural pressure difference, was successful: the 6-week postspinal headache was cured.	1.2872448878600917
Prolonged postspinal headache should be treated by epidural blood patch.	0.775757455279609
The use of over 10 ml cannot be generally recommended, although in this case most of the blood patch of 15 ml was localized caudally.	1.1871050392918676
Careful monitoring for side effects is necessary with blood volumes larger than 10 ml.	0.8992255211295824
If there is no immediate relief, conservative therapy with 24 - 48 h of bedrest is recommended.	1.1502896066455837
If the headache persists a second blood patch should be performed, with the volume and the probable caudal spreading of the first taken into account.	1.2320953456560402
The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of carvedilol therapy in addition to conventional heart failure therapy on heart rate variability (HRV) and on left ventricular function in 14 patients with mild to moderate heart failure due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC).	1.0361960583733434
After a 3- to 4-week titration period, carvedilol was titrated up to 50mg daily, or the highest dose tolerated (at least 25mg daily).	1.1976108735976807
Maintenance treatment was then continued for 8 weeks.	0.7742446352625333
Digital 24-hour Holter recordings were obtained at baseline and after 8 weeks of carvedilol therapy.	0.937899575865225
HRV for the entire 24-hour period was computed in the time domain using the Oxford Medilog Excel 2 analysis system.	0.9853685849652156
Measures of HRV included the mean of all coupling intervals between normal beats (RRm), the standard deviation of all normal RR intervals (SDNN), the square root of the mean of the squared differences between adjacent normal RR intervals (rMSSD), and the proportion of adjacent normal RR intervals differing >50ms (pNN50).	1.0955319698978456
The histologic determination of the degree of tissue anaplasia and grade of malignancy of gliomas is based upon qualitative histological features (nuclear pleomorphism, mitoses, endothelial proliferation, tumor necrosis).	1.0181609131971265
This grading approach is influenced by the subjective interpretation of the pathologist, especially concerning the weighting of criteria (scant, moderate, pronounced).	1.0182216149572152
An observer-independent approach seems to be feasible by abandoning the concept of parameter weighting in favor of an binary approach noting only the presence or absence of these structure parameters.	0.8630720247384186
This grading procedure is recognized in the revised WHO classification of brain tumors for common type astrocytomas (Ste.	0.9105204392431144
Anne-Mayo System, SAMS).	0.640945902194529
Our results indicate that a similiar approach is also suitable for grading purposes of oligodendrogliomas and mixed gliomas.	0.8139723626945072
Our recent investigations on glioma grading showed, both for astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, that a two-tiered grading scheme distinguishing only "low-grade" and "high-grade" cases was prognostically relevant.	1.172198546303684
For all glioma entities the onset of tumor angiogenesis with endothelial proliferation and contrast enhancement in CT and MRI seems to be the key criterion indicating irreversible tumor progression to the "high" malignancy grade.	1.0439423062643234
In patients with severe angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease, who are not candidates for either percutaneous coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery, transmyocardial laser revascularization (TMR) often leads to improvement of clinical symptoms and increased exercise capacity.	1.068447077291156
One drawback of TMR is the need for surgical thoracotomy in order to gain access to the epicardial survace of the heart.	0.9441160846151159
Therefore, a catheter-based system has been developed, which allows creation of laser channels into the myocardium from the left ventricular cavity.	1.2514004569893888
Several phase III studies have proven that the beta-interferons have positive effects on the number and severity of acute exacerbations of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.	0.9346139089528033
Recently the first study on the effectiveness of interferon beta-1b in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis was published.	1.0418230757409774
In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study 718 patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and an expanded disability status scale (EDSS) value between 3.0 and 6.5 were treated with either 8 Mio.	0.9735992568744753
interferon beta-1b or placebo subcutaneously every second day for two to three years.	0.8528162799973111
The primary study end-point was the time until confirmed progression of the disease as signified by a one point increase of the EDSS value (for initial EDSS values between 3.0 and 5.5) or 0.5 point increase when the initial EDSS value was between 6.0 and 6.5.	1.2818690990196098
After two years an interim analysis showed a highly significant difference in delay of disease progression by nine to twelve months for the treatment group (p=0.0008).	1.108266856354767
This means that interferon beta-1b is the first recombinant beta-interferon to be shown effective in the treatment of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.	1.08145119538901
To test the effect of dorzolamide on accommodation or pupillary function.	0.7221772941900525
Cases of female patients who suppose having been sexually abused by their fathers during (early) childhood and wish to explore and work on healing this trauma are being discussed.	0.9106381508019231
As a result of projection and counter transference the therapist developes feelings of distrust, disbelief and of being involved in a "hysterical theatre performance" so that this sort of therapy is very difficult to conceive and carry out.	1.048384771173098
In this contribution an attempt is being made to understand these patients and to examine their psychodynamic background as well as the deeper meaning of their above mentioned theatrical efforts.	1.1120591534650142
On the basis of these cases we can put the following psychodynamic hypotheses: 1) The incest-phantasy is a narcissistic attempt; 2) The incest-phantasy is a symbolic representation; 3) in the sense of a symbolic wish-fullfillment included in the parent-child-interaction.	1.1085708344211322
After this, an attempt is being made to examine in various therapeutical scenes the role of these phantasis during the transference procedings and finally to develope diagnostic criteria with which these patients can be differentiated from others with definitely witnessed sexual abuse cases so that consequently treatment techniques can be devised in future.	0.9663995782669123
Hospitals and clinics for ambulant surgery shall identify and register certain officially defined nosocomial infections (Surveillance) as well as the isolation of bacteria with special and important antimicrobial resistancies (§ 23 Abs.	0.9876461129726036
1 IfSG = Infection Prevention Act).	0.5412062133088965
The nosocomial infections to be recorded, i. e device associated infections and postsurgical woundinfections, have been selected on the basis of national and international experiences with the surveillance of nosocomial infections.	1.0396605880338163
Important antimicrobial resistancies have been determined according to both the prevalence of the bacteria in nosocomial settings as well as their clinical and epidemiological importance.	1.1266175299111125
Most of the relevant data may be provided by the clinical microbiology laboratory but shall be collected, listed and discussed by the staff of wards or surgery clinics.	1.0167847185666812
Both types of documentation shall be used to identify and eradicate problems in hygiene management and to stop further distribution of difficult to treat bacteria like MRSA.They are part of the quality assurance management according to § 137 SGB V.	1.035671229681452
Nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC) belong to the most frequent malignant tumours in certain parts of the world, e. g., south-east Asia, while they occur infrequently in western  Europe.	1.0686221954044366
The association of NPCs with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a transforming human herpes virus, is well established.	1.1036606874253194
The current WHO classification recognises two major NPC histotypes, non-keratinising NPC and squamous cell NPC.	0.8733318192290597
EBV is invariably present in non-keratinising NPCs and the viral oncoprotein LMP-1 (latent membrane protein-1) is expressed in some cases.	1.0789082226474398
The tumour cells of non-keratinising NPCs show phenotypic features which are inducible by LMP-1 in  vitro.	0.9119049461269679
These may contribute to the development of the lymphoid stroma which is characteristic of this tumour type.	0.983937323965947
Furthermore, the virus is detectable in nasopharyngeal carcinoma in situ.	0.8871582113486027
Thus, the virus is likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of  non-keratinising NPCs.	1.1492536486404092
By contrast, the association of squamous cell NPCs with EBV  displays a geographical variability.	0.9757145810667682
It appears, therefore, that squamous cell NPCs are a heterogenous group of tumours distinct from non-keratinising NPCs.	1.0213776197684796
To assess treatment outcome and prognostic factors following postoperative external radiotherapy in 77 patients with low-grade glioma.	0.9507656813871188
Between 1977 and 1996, 45 patients with astrocytoma, 14 with oligodendroglioma and 18 with mixed glioma received postoperative radiotherapy with a median total dose of 52 Gy (range, 45 to 61 Gy).	1.0316406666931226
Sixty-seven patients were treated immediately following surgery, 10 patients with tumor progression.	1.3032227462505326
The influence of various factors including histology, gender, age, seizures, duration of symptoms (<= 6 weeks vs > 6 weeks), CT pattern (enhancement vs no enhancement), type of surgery, total radiotherapy dose and timing of radiotherapy on relapse-free survival and overall survival was investigated.	1.145464279595054
The median overall survival time was 81 month, the 5- and 10-year survival rates were 54% and 31%, respectively.	1.308336626235764
The median time to progression was 56 months, while the 5- and 10-year progression-free survival rates were 45% and 24%.	1.2952350875754892
Univariate analyses identified the total radiotherapy dose (p = 0.01), duration of symptoms (p = 0.05), the presence of seizures (p = 0.04), and the CT pattern following intravenous contrast (p = 0.005) as significant prognostic factors for overall survival.	1.102166321245019
Progression-free survival rates were influenced by the total dose (p = 0.04), the duration of symptoms (p = 0.01) and CT pattern (p = 0.006).	0.9563040649013442
On multivariate analysis, only the CT pattern (enhancement vs no enhancement) remained as independent prognostic factors for both progression-free survival and overall survival.	0.9391994903922115
A minimum total dose of 52 Gy is recommended for the postoperative radiotherapy in low-grade glioma.	1.029658015072073
Tumors with CT enhancement seem to need further intensification of treatment.	0.6759250890832478
We report three patients with severe Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS).	0.9809671232608562
On clinical examination, no sensory deficit was elicited.	0.8928774119686417
Electromyography (EMG) and motor nerve conduction velocity (NCV) studies were indicative of an axonal lesion.	0.9114539212949522
In two patients, we found total peripheral conduction block without volitional EMG activity.	1.0505745358811007
Sensory NCV and cortical median nerve evoked potentials remained normal.	0.6771631044391867
Sural nerve biopsy revealed unequivocal alterations of sensory nerve fibers, some in the form of primary demyelination.	1.0252163803824526
Therefore, these cases must bei classified as combined motor-sensory syndromes despite the clinical and electrophysiological findings.	1.2949853674723506
Although total denervation of the extremity muscles occurred, causing tetraparalysis, this manifestation appears to be attributable to the secondary axonal variant.	1.093585815974842
In contrast to positive reports in literature, immunomodulatory treatment proved ineffective in all three cases.	1.0228091356090747
Continuous spinal anaesthesia (CSA) is a further means of central nerve block for anaesthesia besides single-shot spinal (SSS), combined spinal/epidural, and epidural anaesthesia.	1.1995324689327638
Do hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected food handlers represent a risk for the consumer?	0.9369975357154026
Epidemiological data on HCV transmission  in our opinion do not provide a basis for excluding HCV positive individuals from working as food handlers in general.	0.9973163606249318
Such restrictions seem to be justified only if HCV infected employees might infect their colleagues while performing occupational activities that are associated with a high risk of contracting percutaneous injuries and overt bleeding.	0.9390138989250043
Recently, good functional and anatomical results have been reported in treating full thickness macular holes.	1.2366572711108244
Only a few studies describe a removal of a membrane at the vitreoretinal interface after having removal of the vitreous and its cortex.	0.9679461886276224
To demonstrate the beneficial effects of removing this membrane at the vitreoretinal interface we present our functional and anatomical results in this retrospective study.	0.9662394111246958
Dementia-screening in clinical routine requires short, sensitive and specific tools.	0.9117648204122513
A number of standardized instruments are available for this purpose.	1.0715511943923757
The present study analysed the relationship between size of three examplary dementia-screening tests and their diagnostic accuracy.	1.0877524551780104
A phlebological report requires that an exact diagnostic investigation of the peripheral vein system be carried out to assess both function and morphology.	1.0408857635611333
The most important, reproducible findings can be obtained using dynamic phlebodynamometry and ascending pressure phlebography, as a second expert can directly reconstruct the process by which assessments have been made.	1.2224062376515223
Additional quantification information can be obtained by measuring reflux using colour- coded duplex sonography.	0.9339595677962579
A thrombophilic condition should always be investigated in terms of haemotasis.	0.7654904276876425
In patients with severe post-thrombotic disease, a chronic compartment syndrome of the posterior spaces should be reckoned with, and in such patients magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography and, if possible, dynamic compartment manometry are additional suitable methods of examination.	1.322499489389701
There is currently no generally valid schematization of the post-thrombotic syndrome on which to base an expert opinion.	0.8375424441404268
When evaluating patients, we largely follow our own new classification, which distinguishes four stages based on clinical tissue sclerosis.	1.1417537984408639
Since systemic treatment of neuropathic plantar ulcers in diabetics (DNPU) has so far been rather ineffective, recent reports of successful management of DNPU by short-term retrograde transvenous leg perfusions (RVP) by South American angiologists encouraged us to apply this treatment method in diabetics suffering from chronic DNPU.	1.0621787525848942
Hence, in a prospective comparative clinical trial started in 1989 we have treated 45 male diabetics suffering from DNPU with the same daily doses of netilmycin, administered either in systemic venous infusions (SVI: n=21, three times/day) or in RVP (n=24, once/day).	1.195669757739536
After 10 consecutive days of treatment, ulcers had closed in 8 of the 24 patients treated with RVP, as against 3 of the 21 treated with SVI.	1.0981292179961508
Diminution of the ulcer area by >30% including full debridement was achieved in 10/24 of the RVP cases (SVI: 4/21).	1.062176689992644
During 6 months of follow-up, amputation of toes or forefoot was necessary in only 1 patient in the RVP group, but in 4 in the SVI group.	1.2280780745629176
Partial restitution of osteolytic damage was observed in some cases after RVP.	0.9094020227621624
Our results show that regional netilmycin therapy given by the RVP procedure is clearly superior to equal netilmycin doses administered by SVI for the treatment of DNPU.	0.8772993934295243
RVP can be recommended in DNPU, particularly when the ulcers are complicated by infections.	1.134553610813301
There is hardly any other discipline that illustrates the conflict between the freedom of science and research, that is to say, ultimately, what is medically possible, and human dignity and the protection of life or, in other words, what can be justified in ethical or legal terms, so clearly as reproduction medicine.	1.1253805152972092
The topics involved in this conflict cover a broad spectrum, ranging from in vitro fertilization with subsequent implantation of the embryo through the problems of multiple pregnancy and selective feticide, the many questions raised by assisted fertilization, and especially by anonymous sperm donation, and the controversial techniques of preimplantation diagnosis and cryopreservation, to the legal aspects of prenatal diagnosis, some of which have already been the subjects of cases decided in the supreme courts.	1.237754924629965
In a good many of these sectors it is difficult to reconcile what doctors can do and what it is admissible for them to do, so that it is hardly surprising that there is often no general consensus.	0.9456294286005092
Against this backdrop objective discussion is all the more important, and the notes in this paper, which necessarily touch on only some of the matters at issue, are intended to stimulate such discussion.	1.1659568681865562
In MR-imaging, similar to computed tomography, diagnosis of metastatic lymph-node disease is based on lymph-node sizes, and thereby it is non-specific.	1.1552323732296639
Superparamagnetic iron oxide as a potential contrast medium for MR-lymphography accumulate in normal lymph node tissue after endolymphatic, interstitial and, in case of very small particles, after intravenous injection.	1.0797328354121827
No accumulation occures in lymph node metastases.	0.6510175585956672
Lymph-node metastases can be detected by all three injection techniques.	0.9881759316454708
It has been shown experimentally, that in particular small metastases can be detected in normal sized lymph nodes.	1.2240600062338953
However, MR-lymphography also has inherent methodologic problems, as there may occure an uneven distribution of the contrast medium between different lymph-node groups.	1.312161431405525
The experimental results with endolymphatic, interstitial, and intravenous MR-lymphography as well as first clinical results with intravenous contrast medium injection are presented and discussed.	1.1110449048747537
The purpose of this study was to evaluate anatomical and functional results of vitreoretinal silicone oil surgery for complicated retinal detachments due to trauma and myopia in children and juveniles.	0.9799379540693046
In 1993, we adopted conventional thoracic and abdominal prosthetic grafting and tailored aortoplasty (TAP) of the thoraco-abdominal aortic segment III/IV in chronic-expanding type B aortic dissection (CEAD) to achieve 2 primary goals: 1. reduction of renal/visceral and spinal cord ischemic time; 2. safe and secure reperfusion of all critical aortic branches for prevention of major complications, i. e. paraplegia, kidney failure, and intestinal infarction.	1.1860368955677412
Among 71 thoracoabdominal aortic reconstructions since 1993, 5 CEAD patients (median age 47.8 yr, mean CEAD- 6.5 cm, 4 with Marfan Syndrome) underwent TAP.	1.2763862740644059
Selection criteria are: 1.	0.5783036109130101
CEAD- >5 cm 2. expansion rate >=5 mm/6 months 3. involvement of the critical aortic segment III/IV.	1.2711505479979022
TAP consists of: 1. left posterolateral aortotomy from Th 8 - L 2, 2. excision of the intraaortic dissection membrane(s) 3. aortic closure to a diameter of 3 cm to reduce wall tension.	1.226531984320237
All 5 patients survived without any major complications, particularly no paraplegia.	0.9525084115674977
Mean cross-clamping was 43 min.	0.7444700289689722
After 7 months, 1 patient was successfully repaired due to false aneurysm at the distal thoracic graft suture line.	1.090178360568142
After mean follow-up of 2.4 years, CT-angiography revealed a stable TAP segment (mean aortic- 3.2 cm) in 4 patients and one re-expanded TAP segment (from 4 cm after 24 months up to 7 cm) without signs of re-dissection.	1.3043785646220782
Our 4-year-results (1) corroborate the Johns Hopkins data.	1.077076661089386
Although one re-expanded TAP segment is disquieting, we found the short-term gains so rewarding to strongly advocate the tailored approach as a principle means of avoiding paraplegia in this extremely high risk group of patients.	0.9943499582915339
All optically active molecules have at least one asymmetric atom in common which is attached to four ligands, that can have different three dimensional positions.	1.0153552416185065
Therefore it can be concluded that the resulting isomers are chemically identical in all respects except for the direction with which they rotate plane-polarized light.	0.9841167779685337
When the isomer and its corresponding enantiomer are present in equal proportions, they are called racemic mixture, a mixture that does not rotate polarized light, since the optical activities of the two isomers cancel each other.	1.0615133085060993
Although the isomers are chemically identical other optically active molecules can interact with these isomers in a geometrically specific way termed stereoselectivity.	0.7763188231005828
The human body comprises a chiral environment due to optically active proteins; thus it is not surprising that enantiomeric drugs exhibit different pharmacological properties, when used as pure optical isomers.	0.9677763821940116
Till today most modern anaesthetics have been optical isomers, which are mainly used as racemic mixture (1:1 mixture).	1.2122275110638001
For financial reasons pure isomers were only used for research purposes, but nowadays the wide clinical use of pure isomers is financially feasible due to new production techniques.	0.9626246229137324
The terms eutomer and distomer were chosen to indicate the more or less potent form of the drug.	0.8854555330953925
The clinical use of pure isomers is only of advisable, if there are significant differences between eutomer and distomer in desired or side effects.	1.0171008219724147
Among the modern anaesthetics ketamine, isoflurane, bupivacaine and atracurium exhibit an asymmetric carbon.	0.7893717348979646
For most drugs the separation in pure isomers will reduce side effects.	0.7522839484759486
For volatile anaesthetics this question is still unanswered, since experimental and clinical results are inconsistent so far.	1.036156839950176
The high prevalence of aspirin intolerance in asthmatics and patients with nasal polyps as well as reports of familial clustering suggest a genetic disposition of this disease.	0.9376745827608809
Our study aimed at obtaining further evidence of hereditary factors in this disease.	0.8503412943422568
We included 33 unselected patients from 28 families with aspirin intolerance and rhinosinusitis in this study.	0.802229135536389
Controls were recruited from individuals treated in our ENT clinic for diseases other than aspirin intolerance (n=52).	0.8654585996068067
The application of a tryptophan-free amino acid mixture (tryptophan depletion test) induces a rapid and substantial lowering of both total and free plasma tryptophan.	0.9959179321601442
Consequently, the brain serotonin content and also cerebral serotonin function are decreased.	1.0834055287153004
This method provides a paradigm to study the role of serotonin in the pathobiology of depressive disorders and their treatment modalities.	0.8872554587334412
Untreated depressed patients show few behavioral effects during tryptophan depletion.	0.7070944449356471
In depressed patients during an antidepressant or light-therapy-induced stable remission, a transient depressive relapse was induced by tryptophan depletion.	0.9583881576972666
Healthy subjects with a genetic risk for affective disorder show worsening of their condition induced by tryptophan depletion.	0.867495333741964
These findings indicate the relevance of altered brain serotonin function in the pathophysiology of affective disorders and strengthen the importance of serotonin in the mechanism of action of antidepressants.	0.9322369597726131
Since recently published studies revealed some evidence that the serotonergic system is directly involved in the pathophysiology of various psychiatric syndromes besides depression, it seems to be reasonable to evaluate the validity of the tryptophan depletion test also in non-depressed patients.	1.0274356863029501
Several common chronic pain syndromes come to the attention of the rheumatologist demanding for differentiation from fibromyalgia (FM), although they are often associated with it.	1.133975370707816
They may mimick FM by (1) the occurance of wide spread pain, (2) the chronicity of complaints, (3) the preponderance of females in some of these, and (4) the lack of objective data to be derived from imaging techniques and laboratory tests.	1.1570617770955378
Pain is produced by the disturbance of normal function ("dysfunctional syndromes", MASI, ref.	1.1575349246656657
Recognition requires examination of the locomotor system under biomechanical auspices both at rest and during movement in order to diagnose hyper- and hypomobility syndromes; treatment of these conditions is guided by principles to improve biomechanical function.	1.119128078675393
In addition, the skin needs to be examined to detect panniculosis (also called "cellulitis"), which may be mixed up with FM due to its preferential occurance in peri- or postmenopausal women.	1.1892531360265837
It is concluded that the aforementioned differential diagnosis needs to be considered appropriately in coinciding FM and all studies dealing with FM.	0.9518217444669722
In a prospective, randomized study of patients with acute manifestation of coronary heart disease and hypercholesterolemia (LDL cholesterol >=130<=250mg/dl), we compared the effect of an early-initiated, intensified therapy to usual care antilipidemic therapy with respect to coronary lesions and clinical events.	1.2560997961880005
Patients were included immediately following acute myocardial infarction and/or PTCA because of severe/instable angina pectoris.	0.9788612125877714
The intensified therapy consisted of pravastatin 20-40mg with addition of colestyramine and/or nicotinic acid, if necessary, to achieve an LDL cholesterol <=130mg/dl.	0.9758806263265503
In the control group, antilipidemic therapy was left up to the private physician.	0.8383125560154563

A 10 1/2 year old girl developed a rapidly ongoing paresis of the right leg accompanied by paresthesia, sphincter incompetence and retrobulbar neuritis.	1.0526416895921187
Abrupt vessel closure of the dilated vessel continues to represent a significant limitation of coronary angioplasty.	0.8444982228831825
Despite increasing operator experience and improved technology, abrupt vessel closure continues to represent the most important complication of balloon angioplasty.	0.9396304609647409
Intracoronary stent implantation and pharmaceutical blockade of the GP IIb/IIIa receptor serve as effective tools in the prevention of abrupt vessel closure without completely resolving this problem.	0.8936003967101513
About 50% of patients presenting with abrupt vessel closure exhibit additional complications including myocardial infarction, necessity of CABG or death occurring in up to 10% of acute occlusions.	1.1053272785237114
The purpose of this study is to evaluate if quantitative coronary angiography and assessment of clinical and laboratory data allows risk stratification concerning the probability of abrupt vessel closure.	1.0756456420861773
PTCA in the setting of acute coronary syndrome is associated with a markedly increased risk of abrupt vessel closure, indicating that different risk factors may contribute to the development of abrupt vessel closure in patients presenting with stable angina or acute coronary insufficiency syndromes.	1.0522354075635707
Since the skin dose becomes the limiting factor while deciding the tumorcidal dose, the detailed analysis of dose distribution in the build-up region is necessary for high-energy photon beams.	1.0376561491634955
In this study the beam characteriwstics affecting the build-up and skin dose for 6- and 18-MV photons are analyzed.	1.1270071304005305
Measurements were made with 6- and 18-MV photons using a PTW parallel-plate ionization chamber (B23344-036) and a RDM-1F electrometer.	1.0253509464113668
Build-up ionization measurements were made with the chamber fitted into a 25 x 25 x 25 cm polystyrene phantom with a fixed SSD of 100 cm.	0.9182333953655512
The entrance and buildup dose measurements were made with a polycarbonate and a mesh type metallic shielding tray and a 45 ° wedge.	0.8595090500040174
Exit dose measurements were carried out for the graphite patient supporting assembly table top, 1.0 cm thick piece of wood and the 1.0 cm thick patient supporting perspex base frame for head and neck treatments.	1.0068743030262168
It was observed that the dmax decreased slightly with field size as with other accelerators.	0.8627761753877746
For both photon energies the surface dose was observed to increase with increase in field size.	1.0013572477625852
It was also noticed that the dose in the build-up region increases slightly when the polycarbonate secondary blocking tray is introduced with the increase in surface dose.	1.0092095843106377
The data show that the tray pertubation factor (TPF) at surface decreases steadily with tray-surface distance for both photon beams for all field sizes.	0.9576751948944626
It was noted that the TPF was more when the polycarbonate tray was introduced at shorter tray-surface distances for both energies.	0.8796062113128446
At tray-surface distances above 60 cm the TPF almost remained close to unity for 6-MV photons for all field sizes, whereas the continuous decrease in TPF could be noted for 18-MV photon beams even after the TPF rewached unity.	1.0228358764863679
The increase in surface dose with field size for both photon energies is due to the electron scattering from the intervening materials.	0.8869607869011386
The use of wedge filters absorbs low-energy scattered electrons siginificantly and hence, the relative surface dose (RSD) is always less than unity.	1.056886554639126
The increase in dose enhancement percentage with graphite compared to perspex supporting assembly indicates that the electron backscatter is proportional to the atomic number of the medium.	0.8717056106152299
We investigated the nutritional value of a very low fat diet (diet I) adapted to nutritional habits in Germany.	1.0929415836583014
Data were compared to a low fat diet (diet II) according to the American Heart Association.	0.9166247767515772
The study was performed in 37 patients with coronary heart disease (30 males and 7 females, age 45-83 yrs) stratified to the 2 dietary treatments.	1.1790978600532058
Daily fat intake was 38g (24% of energy intake of 6.5MJ/d) in diet I and 60g (31% of 7.3MJ/d) in diet II (p<0.01), respectively.	1.20795816838758
When compared with dietII, in dietI the intake of cholesterol, saturated and monunsaturated fatty acids, Vit.	0.9319912306294235
B12 were all reduced (p<0.01), whereas the uptake of Vit.	0.9760524137055784
C was increased p<0.01.	1.0887772988918782
The intake of folic acid was low in both groups.	0.7109805688121189
Both diets resulted in a decrease in BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, plasma cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels.	0.828955330512067
Concomitantly plasma triglycerides only decreased in response to dietI but HDL cholesterol levels remained unchanged.	0.6950798497296474
Reduction of BMI and cholesterol levels were dependent on baseline BMI and cholesterol concentrations, respectively.	0.6729286193517451
The cholesterol lowering effect of diet I is in part attributed to the weight lowering effect of the diet.	0.9364386074492174
Taking into account the nutritional habits in Germany, very low fat diets seem to be adequate with respect to their nutritional value.	1.0968065286248576
Both diets are effective in lowering body weight, plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels without affecting HDL cholesterol.	0.7533336093067767
These effects are most pronounced in overweight and hypercholesterolemic patients.	0.739124433914015
Besides autopsy determined findings of a fibro-fatty replacement in the right ventricular myocardium, no assured clinical evidence of arrhythmogenie right ventricular dysplasia-cardiomyopathy (ARVD) exists yet.	1.0251796142128264
Criteria for the clinical diagnosis of AVRD were complied in 1994 by members of the ISFC work group and the European Association for Cardiology.	1.0228567820500158
These criteria include structural, functional, histological, and electrophysiological abnormalities, which were divided into major and minor criteria.	1.1661687964996406
With the successive examination of a collective of 24 patients with a histologically determined diagnosis of ARVD at the Jean Rostand Hospital in Ivry-sur-Seien, France, the value of the complied criteria were checked.	0.9833244663628834
Global or segmental dilatation of the right ventricle in the sense of major criteria could be proven in 20 patients (83%) using angiography or electrocardiography.	1.3111759284657734
Four patients (16%) exhibited only minor criteria in the radionuclear angioscintigraphy or right ventricular angiography in the form of segmental kinetic disturbances of the right ventricular.	1.0774771214200065
In all patients, the typical fibrofatty replacement in the right ventricular myocardium could be histologically determined.	1.1012142711048485
T-inversion in the right precordial leads were present in 17 patients (71%).	0.9485915634035542
A localized QRS-widening of more than 110ms in V1 to V3 in 8 patients (33%) and an epsilon wave in 6 patients (25%) were observed as major criteria.	1.062203808494634
A late potential analysis using signal averaged ECG was only present in 8 patients with positive results in 4 cases (50%) in the sense of minor criteria.	1.1998317045905507
Left bundle branch block ventricular tachycardia, which was classified as a minor criterion, was observed in 23 patients (96%); only one patient died without proven arrhythmia from rapidly progressing heart failure.	1.2427827140139178
A previous history of unexpected sudden death in family members as a minor criterion arose in 3 of 19 patients (15%).	0.8963991386146655
The complied task force criteria for the diagnosis of AVRD led in all 24 cases to the diagnosis of the disease, whereby the value of a determined histological diagnosis was the gold standard.	1.1042022388515382
Without inclusion of histological data, the clinical diagnosis was determined in only 10 cases.	1.3151452219318913
The question remains whether with a simple division of findings into major and minor criteria a pure clinical diagnosis is possible.	0.9094036541079613
Subungual keratoacanthomas (SKA) differ in clinical presentation, biological behaviour and the therapy needed from keratoacanthomas in other localizations.	0.960914585603469
Against the backdrop of two personal observations and a review of the literature, the authors describe clinical and histological features and also the differential diagnosis and therapy and this rare benign neoplasm.	1.2249255246719621
Patients present with a rapidly growing, painful subungual mass, which causes destruction of the underlying bone and usually does not regress spontaneously.	1.0511373127899268
Histological differentiation from squamous cell carcinoma is essential as the prognosis and treatment are different.	1.1351038052451534

Erosions of the underlying distal phalanx usually heal spontaneously.	0.8311200958477066
However, persistent recurrences after subtotal excision often necessitate amputation of the distal phalanx.	1.2993664682055768
Leukotrienes and prostaglandines are important mediators of inflammation.	0.6348189052486115

Methods: Outpatients with active RA have been enrolled into a multicenter controlled trial.	1.0621613941663766
Patients received 9 tablets of active drug (3600 mg) or placebo daily in addition to their previous therapy.	1.0825957670745823
Doses of NSAIDs could be adjusted on demand.	0.6162971379118208
Efficacy parameters, Ritchies Index for swelling and pain, ESR, CRP, pain on VAS and NSAID dose were documented at baseline and 6 and 12 weeks after initiation.	0.9359725620700815
Mean values and medians were calculated to compare the groups for significant or clinically relevant change from baseline or difference between both groups at any time point of observation.	0.6645280315684193
Results: A total of 78 patients were recruited in 4 centers, the data have been published in abstractform.	1.2584310738045479
Only 37 patients (verum 18, placebo 19), enrolled in Ratingen were available for detailled efficacy and safety analysis.	1.0931408213773925
All evaluations in these patients were performed by one investigator (G.H.).	1.188131285488947
There was no subjective, clinical or laboratory parameter showing a significant or clinically relevant change from baseline or difference between both groups at any time point of observation.	0.7126618487211577
The mean NSAID dose reduction reached levels of 5.8% (H15) and 3.1% (placebo).	1.3057008744704781
One patient in each group showed a good response in all parameters but 4 patients in each group worsened.	1.212962885539841
The others showed no alteration of their disease.	0.6636937640725213
Conclusion: Treatment with H15 showed no measurable efficacy.	1.0602137388794333
Controlled studies including a greater patient population are necessary to confirm or reject our results.	0.897800526844721
A 61-year-old woman with depression developed recurring elevated itching erythematous lesions in light-exposed areas after taking St. John's Wort-extract for three years.	0.8599661759348924
Routine patchtesting did not reveal any relevant reactions and photopatch testing was negative.	0.8096026596916045
Using a systemic oral photoprovocation test with St. John's Wort, we were able to demonstrate a decrease of the MED-UVB which was reversible after withdrawal of the medication.	0.927525783738623
Due to its low solubility and the high maximum concentration delivered by the vaporizer sevoflurane is especially suitable for the performance of low flow anaesthetic techniques.	0.9681737445649885
High flow phases for wash-in or wash-out of anaesthetic gases can be kept short, the difference between the volatile's concentration in the fresh gas and within the breathing system is comparatively small, and the time constants are short even during low flow anaesthesia.	1.1406222231344672
The monitoring, required to sufficiently ensure the safety of the patients, corresponds to the current obliging technical safety standards.	0.9461081014480203
As compound A may accumulate in the breathing system, sevoflurane should not be administered with fresh gas flows lower than 1.0 l/min, until the scientific discussion on nephrotoxicity of this substance in humans is solved.	1.0103534742332168
Low flow anaesthesia guarantees a sufficient and continuous wash-out of trace gases.	0.8582735140031714
Thoroughly the use of sevoflurane with dry soda lime must be avoided, as this volatile in an extreme exothermic reaction is absorbed nearly totally and degraded to a considerable degree by dry carbon dioxide absorbent.	1.0128231243578414
The gaseous degradation products are pungent and possibly may be harmful to the patients.	0.8510617414635777
Only by low flow anaesthesia the use of sevoflurane will gain an economically and ecologically acceptable range of efficiency.	0.9295711991610915
Cardiogenic shock is the leading cause of death in patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction.	0.9159172916196076
The typical delay from the onset of acute infarction to the development of cardiogenic shock and well defined risk factors allow for an early identification of patients at risk.	0.9287428215177763
Immediate restoration of coronary artery patency by thrombolysis or PTCA can prevent cardiogenic shock in a number of these patients.	0.8594241393826081
Patients presenting with frank cardiogenic shock should be approached with diagnostic vigor in an attempt to identify a treatable lesion.	0.808335347595781
Several non-randomized studies suggest that PTCA is superior to thrombolysis in patients with shock and ongoing ischemia.	0.8918115200187936
However, aortic counterpulsation may enhance reperfusion rates achieved by thrombolytic therapy in patients with cardiogenic shock.	1.0831907801679694
Early surgery is required in patients with shock due to mechanical complications, such as acute mitral regurgitation or rupture of the ventricular septum.	1.02730019808102

Object of this review is to present the physiological principles, diagnostic techniques and therapeutic options that are related to modifications of oxygen delivery in sepsis.	1.1444070665515633
Despite intense research activities in this area, many topics regarding oxygen transport and oxygen consumption in sepsis are still not clear.	1.0830765338299633
For example, the often discussed shift of the critical value of oxygen delivery to higher values in sepsis has not been proven, yet.	1.1570657444021946
Beside an impaired regional perfusion also disturbances in the cellular oxygen utilization may be responsible for organ failure in sepsis.	1.000661168357975
Until now, it was not shown, whether the increase of oxygen delivery to supranormal levels reduces mortality in septic patients.	1.0958719926113674
It is also unknown, which catecholamine and which infusion solution is suitable for the treatment of septic patients.	1.1168707345335016
In future further research is necessary to solve the problems associated with sepsis therapy.	0.9588857542586489

With local Ethics Committee approval and informed written consent, (1) repeated vomiting was provoked in 16 awake, healthy adult volunteers (10 females, 6 males, 29 +/- 4 years) with a fluid-filled stomach in the presence and in the absence of balloon occlusion of the cardia, while intragastric pressure was monitored, and (2) 30 patients (21 - 89 years) with an increased risk of pulmonary aspiration scheduled for abdominal or traumatologic surgery received conventional induction of anesthesia after blocking of the cardia with the balloon.	1.2394601149041562
Pigs (n=10) with a blocked cardia showed no gastrooesophageal reflux during a total of 60 manipulations to provoke vomiting and regurgitation, while 28 of the 36 provoking manipulations induced reflux in pigs (n=6) with an unblocked cardia.	1.1769465500503968
Among the healthy volunteers with a blocked cardia (n=16), reflux of gastric contents was not observed during repeated attempts to stimulate vomiting.	1.0792561631741606
After termination of the occlusion of the cardia, reflux was able to be induced by 14 of the 16 volunteers.	0.9688217030445503
In 30 patients with an increased risk of pulmonary aspiration the cardia was blocked and anaesthesia was induced using a mask and manual ventilation without encountering any problems.	0.9864646911249433
The average time from loss of consciousness to tracheal intubation was 164 +/- 8 s. Conclusions.	1.0421019791248862
It is concluded from the present results, with further clinical studies pending, that the gastric balloon probe permits low-risk conventional induction sequence of anaesthesia in patients with an increased risk for pulmonary aspiration and that the device may also be safely used during the extubation phase.	1.2348561417885233
The article explains the cognitive psychoanalytic theory of psychotherapy developed by Weiss and discusses the theory in the field between psychoanalytic and cognitive-behavioristic theories and therapeutic techniques.	0.9643985302933703
The basic assumption is: pathogenic beliefs that are based on traumatic childhood experiences prevent normal desirable goals.	0.8094441254853477
Patients are unconsciously motivated to overcome pathogenic beliefs.	0.5972704047101396
In psychotherapy, the patient works to disprove pathogenic beliefs by testing them in the relationship with the therapist.	1.0833506022116008
In this way patients achieve corrective emotional experiences.	0.9058182340589954
The theory is supported by numerous empirical studies.	0.6663319553996834
Treatment with "nootropic drugs" of patients suffering from dementia is often described as arbitrary.	1.0332585224250264
To define the potential usefulness of nootropic drugs, effects and side effects, economic aspects in comparison to other treatment approaches were studied.	0.9715089780464047
A summary of literature published concerning these criteria underlines the efficacy of nootropics in improving the symptoms at the beginning and in postponing the progress of the disease.	0.9782919599520713
The majority of substances does not lead to severe side effects.	0.9190058330809093
There are not enough studies comparing the effects of the substances or on prophylactic effects.	0.9954310460604607
Delayed admission to care units leads to a positi- ve cost effect of nootropics.	0.8322248334913355
Thus, also for economic reasons it seems advisable to treat patients with nootropics.	1.1917523422841456
Better effects are gained when nootropic treatment is combined with training and changing of the structure of the environment.	0.9082649679632226
A proposal for a rational treatment with nootropics is derived from the data.	0.8203251317507287
Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of high-dose Gd-DTPA-BMA (gadodiamide, Omniscan) as a contrast for magnetic resonance imaging of malignant bone tumors and the use of high-dose dynamic studies for predicting the response to preoperative chemotherapy.	1.1036687331736783
Simulation has gained an important role in medical education and continuing education in the field of anaesthesia and emergency medicine.	1.1049358524107287
This article gives background information on how full-scale simulators are applied in medical education as well as in continuing education for advanced anesthesia and scientific applications.	1.11983756702338
Acceptance of training seems enhanced by inclusion of the human factor aspect, since this has proven  to be a major source for the development of critical situations in our specialty.	1.2409899131201019
Furthermore, drawbacks of the simulators available and the current training availability in Germany is described.	1.1809905453816985
We evaluated changes in brain tissue oxygen pressure (ptiO2) and global cerebral blood flow (CBF) during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) in ten anesthetized New Zealand White rabbits (body weight 2.5 +/- 0.5 kg).	1.0974616624287579
CBF [hydrogen desaturation (clearance)-technique) and ptiO2 (Licox-microsensor) right frontoparietal cortex] were determined.	1.0220696417108612
After median sternotomy, the animals were placed on CPB (standard roller pump, nonpulsatile, -stat acid-base management, perfusion flow of 180-200 mL/kg/min, right atrial and aortic cannulation) for induction of DHCA by cooling to 15 °C rectal temperature (1 °C per minute).	1.1463116596342364
Rewarming period was started after 60 minutes of circulatory arrest and the rabbits were weaned from CPB without the use of any inotropic or vasoactive support.	0.9313271756670559
Under baseline conditions, ptiO2 was 38 +/- 5 mmHg and did not change significantly before DHCA.	0.8706812559804427
During DHCA the ptiO2 decreased within 15 minutes to 14 +/- 5 mmHg, after 30 minutes to 5 +/- 1 mmHg and after 40 minutes to zero.	1.0225793458963097
Neither the ptiO2 nor CBF recovered fully following restoration of bypass flow and reperfusion: ptiO2 (25 +/- 4 mmHg vs. baseline: 38 +/- 5 mmHg, p<0.05) and CBF (43 +/- 8 vs. baseline: 68 +/- 11 ml/100 g/min, p<0.05) were significantly reduced.	1.07896892921643
Arterial and jugular-venous lactate levels increased after rewarming (p<0.05) and corresponded to the appearance of a anaerobic metabolism.	0.8562316850673664
These data demonstrate significantly decreased levels of ptiO2 (brain tissue oxygenation) and CBF (oxygen supply) during and after rewarming from DHCA.	0.9903398729768838
The induced impairment of recovery persists after rewarming and generates a temporary low-flow situation with delayed brain tissue reoxygenation on the cellular/mitochondrial level.	0.9551265921974533
Thus, a direct influence on brain functional recovery by the active cooling and rewarming process about the bloodstream during CPB, resulting in disturbed tissue blood redistribution, mitochondrial dysfunction and/or excessive cerebral oxygen consumption (compensation of an oxygen debt) is a possible explanation.	1.156973475139506
While initially advocated primarily for intrasurgical visualization (e. g., craniotomy), interventional MRI rapidly evolved into roles in image-guided localization for needle-based procedures, minimally invasive neurosurgical procedures, and thermal ablation of cancer.	1.0293145999376532
In this contest, MRI pulse sequences and scanning methods serve one of four primary roles: (1) speed improvement, (2) device localization, (3) anatomy/lesion differentiation and (4) temperature sensitivity.	1.0639621699839064

This review summarizes vascular tumours of skin and soft tissues that have been characterised in recent years.	1.0153649600230734
Although most of them are very rare, knowledge about their reproducible clinicopathological features is important to avoid diagnostic pitfalls.	1.060135387707004
These lesions include: bacillary angiomatosis, a vasoproliferative, pseudoneoplastic infection of immunocompromised patients caused by Rochalimaea henselae; tufted angioma, a variant of lobular capillary haemangioma characterised by a "cannon-ball" distribution of multiple lobules composed of packed capillaries and pericytes; microvenular haemangioma, a cutaneous haemangioma composed of thin-walled and irregularly branching blood vessels which dissect dermal collagen; sinusoidal haemangioma, a distinctive variant of cavernous haemangioma which may be located in the subcutaneous breast tissue and then may be confused with well-differentiated angiosarcoma; "hobnail haemangioma" (targetoid haemosiderotic haemangioma), a benign vascular tumour with a distinctive clinical targetoid appearance and a hobnail cytomorphology of the prominent endothelial tumour cells; retiform haemangioendothelioma, a very recently characterised low-grade angiosarcoma occurring most commonly in the extremities of adolescents which is characterised by arborising blood vessels arranged in a retiform pattern and lined by hobnail-like prominent endothelial cells; Kaposi-like infantile haemangioendothelioma, a borderline malignant tumour of infants mimicking Kaposi's sarcoma histologically; epithelioid angiosarcoma, a highly aggressive tumour in the spectrum of epithelioid vascular lesions which stains positively for endothelial and epithelial immunohistological markers; benign lymph-angioendothelioma (progressive lymphangioma), a benign, slowly growing macule or plaque which has to be distinguished from well-differentiated angiosarcoma and Kaposi's sarcoma; and lymphangiomatosis of the limbs, a poorly recognised angiomatosis occurring in young patients and limited mainly to the limbs with a favourable prognosis.	1.0294569683718744

Experimental animal models of ventricular arrhythmias have been developed to investigate the mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis in man.	1.151383174440383
Ventricular arrhythmias associated with ischaemia and infarction often cannot be elucidated by clinical studies on patients because those arrhythmias are potentially lifethreatening and their occurrence is unpredictable.	0.9672303770758627
Because of additional experimental procedures and techniques that can be used in the animal laboratory, such as microelectrode recording of transmembrane action potentials and high-density optical and electrical activation mapping, animal models have provided information that cannot be obtained from clinical studies.	1.0933771954986322
Studies on animal models have provided new ideas and hypotheses that have been tested in clinical studies and that have been found to be true for clinical arrhythmias.	1.1205775251572279
Animal models have enabled the mechanisms of fibrillation and defibrillation to be understood and new therapeutic concepts to be developed.	0.9749962522359309
The purpose of this article is to briefly review some animal models of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation.	1.003561767758047
Some contributions that these animal studies have made to our understanding of ventricular tachyarrhythmias will be discussed.	0.9757170087335061
Because of the clinical importance of coronary artery disease this article concentrates on those arrhythmias caused by myocardial ischaemia and infarction.	1.1332821896377419
The authors report a rare, recently diagnosed and atypical mishap during one-lung ventilation (OLV) via a double lumen tube (DLT) and left-sided thoracotomy: an ipsilateral pneumothorax during ventilation of the right lung.	1.0791635318810417
This occurred in a 63-year-old patient with chronic obstructive airway disease who was scheduled for urgent repair of a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm.	0.9712643993149654
Anaesthesia and surgery were uneventful until aortic cross-clamping release.	0.8353054926285429
The common presentation of increased intrathoracic extrapleural pressure owing to a pneumothorax in patients with mechanically ventilated lungs is a rapid decrease in oxygen saturation, followed or paralleled by haemodynamic deterioration.	1.0194568998430518
Although the above presentation could be seen in this case, the diagnosis of a tension pneumothorax was delayed twice.	1.1226901430654763
First, symptoms were initially obscured by haemodynamic changes resulting from a head-down tilt and aortic declamping.	0.9606368908394677
Second, since the lack of consolidation after aortic declamping focused attention on the airway problems, complications resulting from the use of a DLT were primarily considered.	1.2019657152582057
In particular, since breathing sounds were detectable initially, malposition or torsion of the DLT had to be excluded by fibre-optic bronchoscopy, which involved a further delay.	1.083377916016092
Finally, two observations led to the diagnosis of a right-sided tension pneumothorax: (1) bullae of the contralateral lung, detected during thoracotomy; (2) the finding that ventilation of both lungs and the left lung subsequently increased arterial (SaO2) and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) and the circulatory status, but ventilation of the right lung caused a deterioration.	1.2873165959767758
Chest radiography and insertion of a chest tube with drainage of air, thereafter, validated our hypothesis.	0.9014868540800899
The time course of oxygen desaturation during OLV and tension pneumothorax was as severe as expected; the time course of haemodynamic deterioration, however, appeared quicker and had more impact than expected.	1.029444213807444
Assuming that mediastinal deviation was not hindered by contralateral intrathoracic pressure during thoracotomy, we believed that circulation should be depressed later or to a lesser extent in patients with an intraoperative pneumothorax.	1.1000714024601894
Yet, during thoracotomy, decrease in cardiac filling and output during tension pneumothorax in OLV obviously results primarily from the immovability of the mediastinum owing to mediastinal fixation and is at least as decisive as the contralateral intrathoracic pressure in closed-chest patients.	1.0697114972088744
In summary, a tension pneumothorax during one-lung ventilation and thoracotomy is a rare, but disastrous complication during the use of a DLT, which has not, to our knowledge, been reported previously.	1.1874446972737127
We recommend that tension pneumothorax be added to the list of complications and problems during OLV by the use of a DLT, especially in patients with structural lung diseases.	1.012527125560822
The intramedullary hip screw system Classic-Nail and the Dynamic Hip Screw (DHS) were evaluated in a prospective-randomized clinical trial for operative treatment of trochanteric femur fractures.	1.0295943029391859
Hundred and ten geriatric patients (mean age 82 years) were runningly included in the study (56 Classic Nail, 54 DHS).	1.244275939215051
No significant differences between the two study groups were observed with regard to treatment and follow-up data.	1.0559173666700876
With the Classic-Nail one complete femur shaft fracture and one incomplete fracture occured at the tip of the nail intraoperatively and could successfully be fixed with cerclage wires.	0.9100123566311178
In the DHS group two patients underwent reoperation for significant loss of reduction early postoperatively.	0.823159352343049

Introduction: The goal of this study was to compare contrast-enhanced T1-weighted Flash and Turbo-Flash sequences with conventional spin-echo sequences as a basis for planning high-precision radiotherapy.	0.9594478296083826
Methods: A total of 25 consecutive patients with different intracranial tumors and a disrupted blood-brain barrier were studied.	1.0940663088173397
T1-weighted Flash, Turbo-Flash and conventional spin-echo images were evaluated after controlled 30-s infusion of 0.1 mmol/kg body weight of Gd-DTPA.	1.0231429347572696
The evaluation of the three sequences included the measurement of the signal- and contrast-to-noise ratios, the visual inspection of the tumors and artifacts, and the measurement of tumor size.	1.2239058249042978
Results: The signal- and contrast-to-noise ratios were significantly (P < 0.05-0.01) lower for Flash and Turbo-Flash than for conventional spin-echo sequences.	1.0294944757071265
However, visual inspection of the contrast-enhancing tumors revealed in 23 and 24 of 25 lesions on Flash and Tu-rbo-Flash images, respectively, good or very good tumor visibility when compared with conventional spin-echo images with a reduction of imaging time by a factor of 7-8.	1.1787547743747466
Flash and Turbo-Flash sequences were more prone to susceptibility artifacts, conventional spin-echo sequences more to pulsation artifacts in the posterior fossa.	0.8577305499046306
Tumor sizes were comparable in all three techniques.	0.8842789055465947
Conclusion: At present, conventional spin-echo images are superior to fast Flash and ultrafast Turbo-Flash sequences as a basis for accurate target volume definition in high-precision radiotherapy.	0.9511332314912017
However, fast Flash and Turbo-Flash images may be a practicable alternative to conventional spin-echo images for tumors in the posterior fossa or in patients unable to tolerate a stereotactic fixation device.	1.1137309363740202
Despite some limitations, Turbo-Flash sequences enable fast dynamic MR imaging combined with an acceptable morphology, which may be sufficient for target volume planning in high-precision radiotherapy.	0.9769000019986938

Cell nucleic acids and nucleotides are continuously synthesised, degraded and salvaged.	0.7137266422531736
The body's pools derive from three potential sources: synthesis de novo, salvage (recycling of preformed bases) and the diet.	1.000598272462583
It is generally accepted that de novo synthesis of both purines and pyrimidines from amino acid precursors is capable of supporting the cellular needs for nucleic acid synthesis.	0.7584364550790439
When protein intake is decreased or in situations in which there are a high demand of nucleotides synthesis (after gut injury, after surgical trauma, sepsis, rapid growth: pregnancy or newborn infants, etc.)	1.0118736406266338
some tissues with a rapid turnover (gut and immune system) may increase the salvage of exogenous nucleotides coming from the diet.	0.9789544991072137
Therefore, nucleotides may become conditionally essential nutrients.	1.0757855624088726
This article discusses the possible beneficial effects of dietary nucleotides on small intestine (maturation and recovery) and gut microflora, lipid and hepatic metabolism and on the immune system.	0.9859070822425073
Human milk is the best source of nucleotides for young infants and the nucleotide/nucleoside profile of it shows a substantial predominance for pyrimidines as compared to purines.	0.9775191278824542
Moreover, pyrimidine nucleotides seem to be better preserved in breast milk during storage in the breast and during digestion in the small intestine and they are more absorbed and incorporated into tissue RNA, as compared to purine ones.	1.1251178230155099
Additional research should be done to improve the design of nucleotides supplemented infant formulas.	1.006837155868976
This includes: 1) to investigate in vivo if the incorporation of dietary nucleotides in tissue RNA is enhanced in situations of stress or rapid growth and 2) to study the biological effects of individually administered purine and pyrimidine nucleotides.	1.154302485325493
Parkinson's disease (PD) causes significant expense for the national health care system due to its chronic progressive course, the duration of the disease, the high prevalence and the devastating prognosis.	1.1318043141721503
In Germany more than DM 320 million are spent for drugs to alleviate parkinsonian symptoms.	0.7249285133233213
The aim of this study was to calculate the economic burden of PD by assessing direct medical costs.	0.8760870146329395
Forty patients suffering from idiopathic PD were interviewed at an office of neurological specialists and at an outpatient movement disorder clinic about their use of health care resources 3 months prior to the study.	1.0011123957322456
The total annual costs reported were DM 14,500, consisting of DM 6500 for drug therapy and DM 8000 for other medical services, including hospital inpatient care (DM 5600), outpatient care (DM 700), medical sundries (DM 1100) and physiotherapy (DM 600).	1.1752266087704808
The costs were positively correlated to the extent of the disease (Hoehn and Yahr stage; HY) and the occurrence of motor fluctuations/dyskinesias.We found that both drug-therapy expenses and total medical costs doubled from HYI to HYIV.	1.0722267248777213
The rarely employed s.c. therapy with apomorphine additionally increased the costs of drug therapy in HYV.	0.960462338267995
The occurrence of fluctuations/ dyskinesias also increased medical expenses by approximately a factor of two.	0.6746443943973142
Indirect burden due to increased days off of work, unemployment and earlier retirement are also significant in Parkinson's disease.	0.8334137393688535
This study oncludes that a treatment which could prevent or retard disease progression as well as a treatment that delays or reduces motor complications would not only ameliorate the situation of patients suffering from PD, but would also lead to significant reductions in cost for the national health care system.	0.99168452471606
The cryopreservation of human ovarian tissue is essentially intended to maintain fertility and endocrinological function in female cancer patients and female patients at increased risk of early menopause.	0.9760152801993984
After having been frozen and subsequently thawed, the tissue can, ideally, be transplanted to its original site, where it leads to spontaneous fertilisation.	1.094988808884633
Heterotopic transplantations are also discussed as autografts or xenotransplants in SCID mice.	0.7870674944700631
In addition to the use of whole tissue, the isolation of individual follicles and their in vitro maturation (IVM) are discussed.	1.123215506980223
As in the case of heterotopic transplantation of ovarian tissue, pregnancy can only be achieved in these cases by in vitro fertilisation of the matured oocytes.	1.1497594110110816
Although considerable progress has already been made in both directions, these are still, at the present time, experimental processes that require further in-depth investigation prior to widespread clinical application.	1.0580241831198551
In addition to its use following the cryopreservation of ovarian tissue, IVM of immature oocytes also plays a significant role in promoting current methods of assisted reproduction.	0.945298588838715
The successful maturation of immature oocytes could lead to improved assessment of the oocytes obtained by follicular puncture and to a reduction in the incidence and risk of ovarian stimulation.	1.0845623175473196
IVM is therefore expected to broaden the spectrum of individual treatment regimens as in the case of PCOS patients, for instance, increasing treatment efficacy by the additional acquisition of immature oocytes or by "rescuing" IVF cycles with unintentionally immature oocytes.	1.057530805279227
Background: Transconjunctival peribulbar anesthesia is reported to permit better identification of the bulbar limits because of a better view into the fornix; it is also said to be less painful compared to transcutaneous peribulbar anesthesia.	1.2214267116430293
The aim of our study was to compare the two injection techniques.	0.8440346819997178
The German Registry for Hearing Loss in Children (DZH) processes nationwide data from audiological centers.	0.8444105899873714
Coping with the accrued data and its subsequent management and analysis requires a high degree of security and control.	0.9302293458224808
To establish a nationwide registry it is necessary at an early stage to take into consideration the legal requirements of the participating states.	1.1579991935734502
Use of the DZH as an example demonstrates how a pragmatic solution can be reached.	0.9665211144082116
Special issues concerning data collection, transfer, storage and deletion, coding strategies to ensure anonymity, checking for duplicate entries, data separation, and automated data analysis and data protection are explained.	0.9357014650700548
Cardiac fibroblasts are known to have high affinity corticoid receptors for aldosterone and account for the accumulation of collagen within the interstitium of the rat myocardium in acquired and genetic hypertension.	0.903673114576638
This interstitial fibrosis is an important determinant of pathologic hypertrophy in chronic heart failure.	0.7864025377975408
The social environment in which obstetrics is offered today is characterized by a mentality of weariness: weariness by affluence, ignorance and by misunderstanding.	0.8538868168226618
