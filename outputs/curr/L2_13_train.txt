We should, of course, not get overly excited about it.	0.576569350458868
It marks the beginning, rather than the end, of a process.	0.9277089078688675
Some people have wondered whether our demands are too low or whether there should be more dialogue.	0.5984171169180895
But it is extremely significant for the process to be set in motion.	0.9309237474221834
The issues involved are extremely important but the systems in the European Union are quite different from one another.	0.8372469010397238
The challenges are different.	0.34774539287001216
The levels of employment are different and this is why it is very important to set the ball rolling gently but to make steady progress nonetheless.	0.8026009192480964
In this way, we will be able to meet a number of huge challenges.	0.7894708648294738
The majority within my group is of the opinion that something like this needs to happen.	0.8531049831475542
The funny thing about the Andersson report is that it does not get bogged down with too many details of how everything should take shape; from this perspective it is not a pie-in-the-sky report.	0.6714005735136719
It is a report which tries to give direction.	0.8628335739196051
There are, however, one or two aspects about which I have doubts as to whether or not we are being too specific.	0.8274906997827485
I think that a number of MEPs will make reference to this.	0.6876115363320288
But that does not take away from the fact that the report' s importance mainly lies in the fact that we are developing a strategy and that there is a reasonable chance that it can make a significant contribution in Lisbon.	0.9341851976721381
I believe that if it were to be adopted in Lisbon in this way, Lisbon will turn out to be a success.	0.9982571845713762
If it is not adopted, Lisbon will not add much to what has already been said in the past.	0.9333897426440128
As far as this is concerned, the report, albeit a component, may well be the key component of Lisbon, because it is really innovative, while many other things are merely a rumination of what has been said before.	0.9838856102247382
All in all, I am indebted to the rapporteur and the Committee for this report.	1.1332230418781095
I hope that Europe, in terms of social protection, will make a step forward, taking into account subsidiarity, for without subsidiarity, this would not be possible.	1.1007053863138676
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, like my fellow MEP, Bartho Pronk, please allow me to thank the Commission for this communication and, in particular, to congratulate our rapporteur for the work he has put into this report.	0.9282390144692306
Commissioner, the fact that this report is no longer controversial within Parliament does not mean that it has lost any of its crucial importance.	1.0429381593914737
There have been times within this Parliament when such discussions on social security were actually quite awkward.	0.5375561709209766
It is also a timely discussion - as Mr Pronk said just a moment ago - at a time when preparations are in full swing for the Lisbon Summit, which intends to find out how we can put economic growth, employment and social cohesion on the agenda in Europe via the Information Society.	0.9614252730482468
Within my group, it speaks for itself that social protection forms an important part of this social cohesion and should thus also be added to the agenda in Lisbon.	0.8505963185353708
My group is pleased that the Social Affairs Council gave the go-ahead for a better cooperation strategy as early on as the end of last year and that, in fact, a group of high-ranking officials has already been commissioned to submit to the Council an initial report by June 2000.	0.8182463155305143
However, we, the Parliament and, in particular, the group of the Social Democrats, want Lisbon to go one step further now.	1.0146629511998508
It is of great importance that, in our fellow MEP' s report, this European Parliament advocates a true European strategy of social convergence, based on what provisions have been made for employment via the so-called Luxembourg strategy, that is to say it should encompass common goals, guidelines, national action plans and performance evaluations.	0.8484532507777184
We believe that this course of action is ambitious, yet achievable.	0.8225018806740497
Needless to say, it is clear that harmonisation of social security is not viable at European level.	0.6981579971863279
The financial and organisational systems vary too greatly for this, and this is also an important reason why social protection has only just been put on the European agenda, and why, in fact, scenarios such as Danny Peters' thirteenth Member State or the European social snake have scarcely got off the ground.	0.8286424628344946
But this new course of action is very exciting.	0.5084381355366403
The employment strategy has proved that it can function well and social convergence is also necessary, for our social security systems are facing the same challenges, and in an EMU era, social security systems would otherwise threaten to fall prey to social competition.	0.925912024080315
But let me make one thing clear on behalf of my group: social convergence strategies should not be an alternative to social legislation.	0.8509345114879712
They can merely serve as an extremely useful complement to what we are developing and expecting from the Commission in terms of social legislation.	0.9210431106392695
I think that it also a good thing if, moreover, the European Parliament tried to convince the Council to substantiate the common strategy as early on as in Lisbon and to launch an annual procedure to reduce poverty levels no later than at the beginning of 2001.	0.8059989905733784
I am pleased about the fact that the European Parliament supports my group' s idea and we hope, Commissioner, that we can also count on your support.	0.9332303757893737
Finally, we urge the European Parliament, both sides of industry and social NGOs to be closely involved in this process.	0.9430259267944394
The success of this strategy hinges on a broad and democratic base and we hope that we can count on your support.	0.750670663716528
Mr President, the four chief objectives which the EU countries' governments endorsed in November of last year and which were mentioned earlier here today were as follows: that care should be taken to ensure that it is worthwhile working and guaranteeing oneself a secure income; that pensions should be guaranteed and pension arrangements made sustainable; that social integration should be promoted; and that sustainable, high-quality health care should be guaranteed.	0.8324965467387058
These are four goals which have been worded in such broad terms that everyone must be able to support them. Having a group of high-ranking officials as the focal point for the pooling of experience and for the coordination and evaluation of the ways in which social and labour market policies are being developed is also something we can all benefit from.	0.7118586616345012
The Commission' s communication, which we are discussing today and which was put by for a decision by the Council in November, is a well-balanced report on how we can obtain a more professional debate and more knowledge of the challenges faced by the Member States in the field of social policy over the next few years when we have ageing populations and are experiencing the effects of the enlargement of the Union.	0.9815857569025256
We now already have major social problems and major social costs to find from the public budgets, which is a problem for many Member States.	0.7654380942193274
If reforms are not got under way, we are in danger of eroding the economic basis of social policy, and a strong and competitive economy is now undoubtedly the most secure basis for effective social security.	0.8313752191037789
It is therefore only reasonable to put these subjects on the agenda.	0.7773113302967126
In the debate about coordination of social policy in the EU, we often use the expression social convergence.	1.1177678870226762
As liberals, we can support this concept when it means that we in the EU are to establish broad common objectives with which the individual countries then seek to comply by means of their own national social policies.	0.8700901848930553
It is not, therefore, about harmonisation but about common objectives.	0.6561292144804317
It is, of course, a fact that the EU countries have different ways of organising social policy.	0.8592733301930529
We have different traditions and there are differences in culture and, in spite of there being many points of similarity, there are also major differences between one country and another in the nature and extent of the social problems concerned. It is therefore important to emphasise that social policy is a national concern.	0.8615294974731135
National policy is, of course, subject to a number of common parameters. That is the case with minimum social entitlements, which are established by treaty.	0.8612188767000065
It is true in regard to guaranteeing the free movement of labour without loss of social entitlements. It applies to the fact of our having to coordinate our economies; and it applies in the case of economic cooperation.	0.9182195537898956
So coordination and cooperation are facts of life. But convergence should be about goals, not means.	0.795420881855442
I should also like to thank the rapporteur, Jan Andersson, for his report and for his very constructive contribution to the attempt to reconcile different positions and to secure support for his report.	0.7508430330676725
I can support the report, but there are a few points which are not completely to my taste.	1.101566268646452
I do not agree with the requirement that the Commission should intervene in regard to what is referred to as unfair competition between social and tax systems, if interference of this kind is to be used to stem the tide of new thinking and to restrict development and the process of making our social systems more efficient, or else to prevent a reduction in the unduly high tax burden in many EU countries.	0.8932648860555613
I am sceptical about the detailed regulations that might result from the Commission' s having to deal with the scope and quality of child care and care of the elderly, and I am sceptical about the value of a common poverty threshold.	0.7699899972644617
Dialogue and the coordination of social policy are to be commended, but we should not lump all nations together as if they were the same. There should be room for a multiplicity of solutions.	0.9215108335485831
Mr President, Commissioner, with regard to the strategy which has been set out here on modernising social security, I would like to point out some positive things as well as raise some questions that have come up for me.	0.7911998363132582
I feel positive about the movement which is very gradually taking place in the dossier.	0.613353068158186
This seems to be a good thing and useful.	1.069481204838793
I also feel positive about the essence of the communication, namely the strategic approach.	0.7448900688026984
We therefore hope that the four objectives which are mentioned in it can reasonably be achieved.	0.5953560136264291
We would also underline the importance of the way in which the strategy is handled. On the one hand, it would be useful to have guidelines and a process styled on Luxembourg, but we also think it is important, as is already mentioned by Mrs Van Lancker, that guidelines are drafted to accommodate less typical work scenarios, such as sole traders, etc.	0.8877311553443561
We nonetheless foresee two problems for which solutions will need to be found.	0.6052212616328685
The first problem is that concerning the downward adjustment of social security, which, we hope, will be replaced by high-level convergence.	0.9401282428405912
I can illustrate this with examples from a study which was carried out recently by the Dutch trade union movement into social security reforms within the European Union.	0.49626766603895317
It appears from this study that adjustments are rife but most of these adjustments, in fact, the majority of them, appear to be downward adjustments, the remainder being improvements.	0.7317599936173222
The lion' s share of these adjustments pertains to pension plans: eleven restrictions and two improvements.	0.37370480641626835
In the case of unemployment benefits, we came across six restrictions and five improvements.	0.6876321689033551
The reasons for adjustments are, for example, to improve employment, reduce social security expenditure, but are also due to policy competition and EMU criteria.	0.8716725776813109
Policy competition mainly occurs in the northern countries.	0.4564135010275529
The highest level of stability and even improvement of social security can be found in the southern countries.	0.862917580507108
All in all, both sides of industry only have a limited role to play in the process as a whole.	0.8263772929412212
This is nothing to write home about and means that the convergence strategy must focus on the best approaches.	0.6904011786347859
To use a figure of speech, cappuccino is not always good for us.	0.7000787626219307
Mr President, I would, in turn, like to congratulate both the Commission, for making another step in the convergence process with regard to social security, and the rapporteur for the sound report he has compiled.	1.073942437523296
The European Union' s policy encompasses social policy in addition to economic and employment policy.	0.8689212111809366
So far, social policy has remained limited in terms of set-up and resources.	0.6668517757648899
But under the influence of the free movement of employees, of the internal market and of the euro, the labour markets are actually beginning to become integrated.	0.9149512706250199
This has undeniable repercussions on social protection which is tied in with labour to a large extent.	0.5390947784129944
Cross-border workers, employees on secondment and migrating employees, as well as job-seekers, students on placement and other students, experience hindrances in exercising the right of free movement. This is due to a lack of coordination and a lack of convergence in terms of social protection.	0.6496917290235051
In fact, the same phenomenon occurs in tax law.	0.6852008124283246
In order to combat distortion of competition and prevent dumping, the Commission has, in my opinion, developed a well-balanced approach which steers a midcourse between harmonisation and non-intervention.	0.8008598934370958
On the one hand, binding and enforceable rules apply to equal pay or additional old-age pensions and on the other hand, programmes are used to offer incentives with regard to non-discrimination or social exclusion.	0.5358935900300033
Based on a number of recommendations, reports and communications, the Commission has made another step in the convergence process by setting out objectives and by setting up a working party of high-ranking officials.	0.8082774546322893
Both proposals have already been accepted by the Council and it is thus a matter of endorsing this approach in order to be able to make an assessment in time, with knowledge of all facts and/or in order to establish to what extent and in what way social protection should be reorganised in the European Union.	0.8527145334928127
Indeed, expansion, globalisation, a sharp increase in the ageing population, individualisation and changes in family situations render such reorganisation inevitable.	0.5795317341710935
Denying that such shifts take place is tantamount to surrendering social protection.	0.31720782569763845
With regard to eurosceptics and nationalists, I would say that social protection within the boundaries of a Member State is not social and offers no protection.	0.740606658919879
Indeed, if social protection were to be phased out as a result of competition, this would also harm social protection as a production factor.	0.8199401992428426
And less social protection means less purchasing power, fewer healthy employees and fewer happy employees.	0.3269073496837729
In respect of the super-Europeans, I would say that European social protection is neither attainable nor desirable.	0.7362231115716553
The discrepancies between the Member States are too immense in terms of provisions, rightful claimants, revenue or benefits, etc. It is thus impossible to bring all States into line.	0.6246746886458489
The path which the Commission is walking is, in fact, obvious.	0.8369574834739876
It has the advantage of clarity, and it can collect data and exchange experiences in order to agree on objectives and finely tune solid, comparative indicators and put forward recommendations.	0.7217113264575001
I endorse this view.	0.2977350832942661
I will give my support to the Commission and I hope that Lisbon will take us a step forward in this matter.	1.0322237420971776
Mr President, Mr Andersson' s report contains a lot that is of interest.	0.9154038591017022
Unfortunately, what is most interesting is that the report, which purports to be concerned with a combined strategy for modernising social policy, instead proposes an extension of traditional social policy and more supranationalism in the social sphere.	0.891986490208998
Social policy needs to be renewed in order to reduce unemployment in the Member States.	0.7053522987448448
Even though the socialists, now that there are so many social democratic governments, talk much less about unemployment than they used to, the unemployment in question is still high, and this in spite of the trade boom.	0.9178767609879087
Something must be done so that unemployment does not turn the so-called European model into a parody.	0.4983040539179613
Social policy must facilitate employment, creating incentives for employers and employees to, respectively, provide and accept jobs.	0.5715365280284189
Mr Andersson' s report demands social convergence, that is to say that systems should be increasingly standardised within and throughout the EU.	0.7221844116483145
The EU should apparently adopt what are called real convergence criteria, which would be binding and of real effect.	0.8156534352434334
Mr Andersson also wants to see efficient and ambitious tax coordination, that is to say supranationalism in the fiscal sphere.	0.6607866017486398
The EU should also, on the basis of a uniform definition of poverty thresholds, table recommendations concerning what is called the minimum acceptable subsistence level in the Member States.	0.6585679577997797
The EU should devise guidelines governing the quality of the job opportunities which are to be created, whatever that may mean.	0.8486447281696292
It is certainly not going to be possible to reduce unemployment with all these additional regulations and forms of interference.	0.8321027271001514
Those structural problems which make unemployment higher in Europe than in the United States will become even greater.	0.5400049360602546
There is no need at all for supranationalism in this area.	0.8247067300159189
The Member States can devise their own systems in the social sphere, each within the framework of its economic resources and political preferences.	0.8829215732969223
It is most especially important not to create unnecessary problems before the enlargement of the EU.	0.6606204963507974
Mr Andersson thinks that the less wealthy Eastern countries should be reminded that social convergence is to apply to them too.	0.6325182054291086
It is obvious, however, that these countries, impoverished within a Communist economic system, cannot cope with a social policy like, for example, Sweden' s.	0.872326629763753
Talk of minimum regulations and poverty thresholds is meaningless to the present Member States and unreasonable as far as less wealthy applicant States are concerned.	0.6485321631383353
Mr President, as others have done, I should also like to congratulate Mr Andersson for the report he has produced.	0.996130732645078
He has done a great deal of work on behalf of Parliament in producing a wide-ranging consensus on what is, by any definition, a thorny issue, not just in this Parliament but in virtually every Member State.	1.0338998166852928
I also welcome the Commission's communication.	0.9342647752363422
It was slow in coming but well worth waiting for.	0.3836623672500245
It could be a landmark in the development of a social Europe, providing we take it seriously and do not allow individual Member States to baulk at the steps that must be taken to implement it.	0.7976103588756093
We can, and must, take the unique European social model we have and reform it to fit the twenty-first century, a century which is globalising fast.	0.7472688430624078
I am afraid the proposals that are being put forward by Mr Herman Schmid will not deal with that globalising world.	0.7708778607509525
To be successful we have to ensure that our economic policy, our employment policy and our social protection policy in its broadest sense, are integrated and that we deal with them as a whole.	0.9592701176863361
We have to ensure that our ECOFIN ministers and our employment ministers acknowledge that social affairs ministers have a contribution to make to the establishment of a society in Europe which is creative, has initiative and which will provide a high quality of life for all of our citizens.	0.9706265081715271
This is not an option for us any more.	0.8216901480091933
It is an imperative.	0.7348466146698985
European citizens will not settle for any less than a quality of life which befits them as human beings.	0.5999409808896445
We do not want the US model - a model which has spectacularly failed to create the employment that is necessary to provide a decent quality of life.	0.9053137673115657
What it has done is increase dramatically the number of working poor in the United States.	0.6424911197243484
That is not what we want to do in Europe.	1.1284969947515866
We have the traditions of solidarity in Europe and we have the experience of a better way of doing things.	1.1141082815987045
But we have to grasp the tools to do that.	0.922189326697491
I therefore urge that we not only implement the high-level group as proposed by the Commission but also go further and have a Luxembourg-type process so that we have an integrated approach to this issue of social protection.	0.9212693584708312
Mr President, Commissioner, this is one of the social areas to which the European Union ought to pay much more attention.	0.9422012711300499
Macroeconomic policies, the stability pact and the criteria for nominal convergence have put a brake on modernising social protection which would improve the quality of people' s lives, specifically by means of a significant increase in pensions and pension schemes, particularly of the minimum pensions, and through fighting social exclusion.	0.8772652967297273
This situation is particularly serious in countries such as Portugal where the minimum pensions and pension schemes are barely more than half of the minimum national wage which in turn, is the lowest in the whole of Europe.	0.7555815438908553
Therefore, while the Commission does not accept the need to amend its macroeconomic policies to create more jobs of quality, with employee rights, which is a fundamental basis for maintaining and modernising a solid, public social protection system, we harbour serious doubts as to its position.	0.9253693247976096
Although the Andersson report has gathered some positive proposals, including some that we put forward ourselves, we are still critical of some of the bases for the Commission' s proposal and we still have concerns about the strategy for modernising social protection.	0.8559632208386327
Mr President, in my previous life I ran two manufacturing businesses, one in the United Kingdom and one in the Netherlands.	1.0707246426138288
As the UK business grew, we invested in more people, as the Dutch business grew we invested in more machinery.	0.791227965227714
The simple reason for this was that social costs in the Netherlands were just too high in comparison.	0.6752379438332827
I am in favour of social protection, I am in favour of the original Commission document, but I do not want to see people priced out of jobs because social protection costs become unrealistically high.	0.8516854644747248
That is why in committee I proposed some form of business impact assessment, so that costs and risks to jobs could be taken into account, and the EPP-DE Group supported this amendment.	0.7912628741288186
But I must record that other groups, led by the PSE Group, guided by my countryman, Stephen Hughes, voted this out.	0.5871962896518158
I accept that Mr Andersson's report is very well-intentioned, and I respect him for the work he has done, but in my view the way the report defines and promotes social convergence would drive social costs higher throughout the EU.	0.9242733560026242
This would put more jobs at risk and also put at risk the credibility of this House by showing how remote we are from the real world.	0.6270657347980128
I therefore urge this House to reject the full report and let the original Commission proposal, which was very well-balanced, stand unamended.	0.9035664942186074
Mr President, we are unable to vote for this report.	0.8895524683730045
The European Union should actually place social issues at the heart of the building of Europe.	0.726133299545281
Social rights should determine economic choices, and not the other way around.	0.9181845561621785
This is why, when it comes to social protection, we are opposed to schemes copied from the Luxembourg process which run counter to this rationale: broad economic guidelines, then convergence criteria and, finally, social issues, dealt with as the last resort.	0.7902290840005782
The European Union should proclaim one general principle, to wit, that the social rights acquired in Member States may not be restricted.	0.961071667265153
Any Community intervention should aim to complement and to harmonise existing guarantees according to the highest common denominator.	0.431231840726878
In order to strengthen the funding of social security systems, we need a policy of general wage increase, the establishment of a minimum legal wage in each Member State.	1.0027317818067314
In order to fight poverty, entitlement to an income and to employment are inalienable rights.	0.4995223043781394
Finally, in order to avoid health being treated in any way as a commodity, the European Union should declare itself clearly opposed to pension funds and to a situation where private insurance companies have access to the health system.	0.8849422048288452
I sincerely hope, in conclusion, that social Europe cannot be satisfied with mere words and pious hopes.	0.8041502983519951
For millions of people the situation is too tragic for that.	0.6222910203644668
Mr President, Commissioner, the aim of developing a coordinated strategy for modernising social protection in the European Union is certainly an admirable one. Just as the launching of a European convergence strategy on employment and labour market policies at the Luxembourg Summit was commendable.	0.8536000252082402
The labour market and social protection are, in fact, two sides of the same coin, that require harmonised policies and rules.	0.9704776000031966
If the labour market functions by means of certain levels of employment, flexibility and salary discipline, then it is impossible for the welfare state and social protection not to function, and vice versa.	0.8070437979214551
Until recently, the European countries fixed, it could be said in an autarkic way, the rules governing the functioning and financing of the two markets.	1.0564941532884282
Budgetary and exchange rate policies were responsible for maintaining internal and external stability.	0.39761330953929647
With the Maastricht Treaty and the single currency, budgetary discipline became tighter and recourse to devaluation ceased as a means of endeavouring to restore marginal competitiveness.	0.4647754161229464
The structural and economic differences of the various countries cannot, therefore, be rebalanced through budget deficits and trade.	0.7307551046826606
That being the case, in the absence of complete labour mobility inside the Union, and without a redistributive fiscal policy at federal level, it is left to the labour markets and welfare systems to provide what degree of flexibility there is to remedy both structural and economic disequilibria, the so-called exogenous asymmetric shocks.	0.6826131787898864
And therein lies the paradox.	0.17500252003239158
Political and monetary convergence in Europe unavoidably entails convergence of the respective rules of the game in the labour market and welfare systems.	0.5775769169030945
But, at the same time, the single currency and the absence of labour mobility, as well as of a redistributive fiscal policy, force us into a situation of non-convergence in terms of salaries and welfare, in order to compensate for the differences in marginal productivity at national and regional levels.	0.7300388199298448
Hypocrisy and fine-sounding words such as convergence, benchmarking, modernisation and concerted action are not going to extricate us from those contradictions.	0.5222013189080182
Either the European Union becomes a genuine federal state with a genuine redistribution of resources, genuine free movement of workers and therefore - but only at that point - common labour and welfare regimes, or it would be better not to deceive and be deceived by hopeless paths to convergence which sound impressive but which, in reality, only cause harm, above all to the most vulnerable.	0.8265753823593159
That is something we would do well to recognise.	0.7521556443841397
Mr President, unlike several of those who have spoken in today' s debate, I am inclined to endorse the Andersson report, one of the reasons for this being that I can see clear differences between the report and the Commission' s communications.	1.0232279075252955
In particular, I am referring to the fact that this report - and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this - defends the European social model' s approach, which is one based on solidarity.	0.9943554681761889
I would like to highlight the clear positions adopted against social dumping, together with the right to a basic level of social security, the goal of social convergence, and, in particular, the quite specific points that have been made about equal opportunities for women being the primary objectives of this social policy.	0.8946755706008923
I can certainly see that it has its shortcomings in failing to undertake a sufficiently rigorous analysis of macroeconomic policy within the European Union, and it is this policy which stands in the way of the aforementioned solidarity-based revival of the European social state, model.	0.8363440305185622
All in all, though, I deem this report to be worthwhile.	0.838569763481961
Mr President, I have taken the floor in order to reaffirm the need for the modernisation of social protection, which is much more then simply one more step in the construction of Europe.	0.9988659163103716
This message is contained in the excellent report by Mr Andersson.	0.6343791352046857
Europe, the European Union, although it is very strong in economic and political terms, will remain shaky, weak and limited, perhaps inadequate, if we are not able to strengthen it from a social point of view.	0.9696681528738056
I believe that the latter means the possibility of employment for those who require it, but also decisive action in support of the socially disadvantaged.	0.8835701244598483
Bearing in mind that everybody has the right to social protection and a minimum guaranteed social income, I believe that we must not forget about those people who were not born in the European Union.	0.961234085808095
Let us not forget that, in 1999, 717,000 people came here to compensate for our low birth rate.	0.6605614319940308
In social terms, it is therefore absolutely essential that we have an immigration policy with a social conscience, as President Gutierres recently stated in Spain.	1.0423437036178507
We must be very aware of the situation of those people whose prospects of finding work are threatened or reduced by economic changes, mergers, take-overs, new technologies etc.	0.7925836206249475
What is required here is a training policy to qualify and prepare people for new jobs, for those who already have a job and for those who need a second opportunity, because sometimes, as the title of the film states, the postman always rings twice.	0.8951960161369888
In my humble opinion, it is the responsibility of all European, national and regional governments to ensure that he rings on more than one occasion.	0.8859834791160854
It seems to me, Commissioner, that the Commission has the responsibility to promote and coordinate these opportunities.	0.9816197302016563
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Andersson on his really excellent work, which is the reason why there is broader agreement, and I also thank the Members of Parliament involved for their contribution.	1.03309438451925
I would like to make a number of comments about what has been said.	0.8868408745123234
First, I must stress that the debate about social protection issues began several years ago among the European bodies and since 1995 there has been the first statement entitled: "The future of social protection" and there have been statements from the European Parliament, those of Mrs Weiler and Mr Pronk.	1.017831980986979
Today, we have the statement by Mr Andersson.	1.2503250336846923
I believe we have made considerable progress since we are now talking about the modernisation of social protection.	0.9873333007774696
The second point is that we must bear in mind the legal basis by virtue of which the European Commission can operate.	1.2042689890709883
You know very well that the Treaty provides no legal basis for policies at European level, but there is the agreement expressed at the last Council, there is agreement that work should begin on coordination and the exchange of experience, as well as the exchange of successful programmes between the Member States.	0.8670765321138932
The third observation is that as regards the four issues on which the specific statement focuses, which relate to paid work, the sustainability of pension systems, social convergence and lastly quality in health care, there is a horizontal approach to the issue of women because in each of these categories - as the speakers said - there are special problems relating to women and those problems should in many cases be addressed by separate policies.	0.8611401894972854
The next point concerns the specific action we have undertaken.	0.42944916479653633
As you know, a high-level group has already been set up by the Portuguese Presidency, which will present its first report to the Summit Conference in June.	0.9356561916537306
The Portuguese Presidency has focused on two things: sustainable pension systems and social accession.	0.5925851243726225
I believe that the proposal for a corresponding group at Parliamentary level is very positive and can contribute towards our progress to the next step after approval of the said high-level group.	0.7661682903345653
Concerning some remarks about the role of social protection systems, the cost of social protection and the part played by those systems in the competitiveness of the Member States, I should like to say that in Europe policies strive to combine competitiveness and social cohesion.	0.9100497026031126
Of course, we must take due note of the issue of competitiveness, but social protection too must be planned in a way that makes it a factor of economic growth and employment.	1.0016080110128596
I think the statement' s content makes this clear.	0.6371281117641717
Ladies and gentlemen, the aim is that in the next year, and after a unanimous decision by the Council, we should progress to a first level of coordination, exchange of views, listing of social problems and creation of a data base for the better coordination of policies.	0.9693819376004739
As many of the speakers have said, I believe a first important step has been taken.	1.0555574719327887
Already at the Intergovernmental Conference, social policy issues are being addressed more broadly and I believe we are in a new phase, in which social policy will, to a large extent, become a European policy.	1.1014881595186892
Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou.	0.7491629419441753
The debate is closed.	0.04146649521247962
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	0.23627004318223602
WIPO treaty	-0.0
The next item is the recommendation (A5-0008/2000) by Mrs Cederschiöld, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a Council Decision on the approval, on behalf of the European Community, of the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty [COM(1998) 249 - C5-0222/1999 - 1998/0141 (AVC)].	0.5959559496094552
Mr President, we are now taking a stance on an important issue, an international agreement, which may influence the prospects for prosperity of many Member States.	1.0229490444906881
In my own country, Sweden, one of our biggest export industries is affected, namely the music and sound recording industry.	0.7126262748522537
It is about artists' entitlement to copyright or to protection for their artistic products.	0.4791230754039313
It is about the WCT (World Copyright Treaty) and the WPPT (World Performance and Phonograms Treaty).	0.7855431244070046
Without protection under intellectual property law, creativity is inhibited and financial incentives obstructed.	0.37900298499993235
Forgeries are big business.	0.12056425184668167
It is estimated that, in Europe alone, income of EUR 4.5 billion is lost because of piracy.	0.7561099998594889
The problem affects a lot of jobs in the entertainment industry.	0.5734953272418394
This is an historic agreement because the EU is the contracting party. This is the case, in spite of the fact that it is not the EU, but only the Member States, which belong to the organisation.	1.1495452473205214
There exists a special clause which requires Parliament' s assent in two cases.	0.429052858562722
With regard to the present agreement, both these conditions are fulfilled.	0.9156282783130896
A new institution is being created, an assembly which, in the future, will monitor the agreement and its consequences.	0.9449644519269549
The agreement also concerns questions dealt with in accordance with the co-decision-making procedure.	0.6047730852623189
Parliament must therefore give its assent, because the agreement concerns its sphere of competence.	0.7346378366829297
The future will show whether it is right, by means of this new parliamentary assembly, to reduce the Commission' s powers regarding these issues.	0.9756687020406937
Parliament cannot, in any case, at present do anything about the matter.	0.9200471078295022
The agreement complements the Berne Convention in regard to literary works.	0.3506537468011275
It creates international legal protection in connection with distribution, sale, rental, public reproduction and the making available of works.	0.559519696568475
It also creates protection for software and databases.	0.2557737846303175
There are problems regarding the term "author" .	0.4682319210303025
For example, it has not been defined.	1.0860198515109942
Another issue, which is somewhat problematic, is that of intermediate storage.	1.0255738154495848
This too has not been solved.	0.558346955148626
It is dealt with by means of a general clause which does not provide any definition.	0.616699857932562
If no definitions are provided in questions such as this, it can lead to their being dealt with differently around the world, with no uniformity of approach.	0.7893298941516308
That would not be a good thing.	0.9590743329033157
The question of arbitration procedures is still to be resolved, too.	0.8150544583367392
Parliament cannot change these details.	0.237795094676964
We can only say yes or no to the agreement as it stands.	0.8369262822964368
Yes or no to an agreement which contains deficiencies.	0.6907663768329351
Both myself, as rapporteur, and the committee think we ought to say yes.	1.0292817849526366
We have here an agreement which, in spite of its defects, constitutes a significant step forward for the issue of copyright.	0.8032432771171585
We have of course discussed at length whether Parliament and whether the EU should have powers in regard to patents under intellectual property law.	0.6328728929151083
I think they should have.	0.7518001700367648
However, there is still no Community legislation in the areas of patent law and protection of designs, and there needs to be.	0.9972934434182255
A European patent is in the offing, and that is a good thing.	1.0898898521623708
Now, the Union and the Member States are combining to take the first steps in the area of intellectual property law.	1.0345351657067954
It is good for us that we have the power to do this, in spite of the fact that we are not completely satisfied.	1.193837069261653
In that way, we can act as a model for the applicant States.	1.0187493248410826
We have a direct financial interest in these issues being settled before enlargement.	0.7685150770279623
I want to thank the Commission for its efforts in this area and for the cooperation with the Commission' s officials, which has been quite excellent.	1.1730918750021602
Finally, I also want to thank this Chamber for being so good as to listen to these words at this late hour.	0.7556628147834747
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Cederschiöld, on her very serious work.	0.8881429465213238
She has clearly identified the problems created by the approval of the World Intellectual Property Organisation' s treaties.	0.649128889440569
Their approval is undoubtedly an historic occasion because for the first time the European Union is participating as a contracting party in an international treaty that governs the field of intellectual property.	0.6670440155025968
It is a fact that the road has been a long one, mainly because of the legal problem that arose in connection with the extent to which the Community could be considered to have absolute competence in matters of intellectual property.	0.8194992899921293
The problem has been overcome.	0.32074928462484104
Today we are asked to give our assent in effect to two treaties: the treaty on intellectual property and the treaty on interpretations, performances and phonograms.	0.8166322681111242
As regards the first of these, it seems to provide an effective solution for the long-standing demands by the creators of artistic and literary works, while at the same time creating a framework of protection in relation to issues such as distribution, rental and the presentation of their works to the public.	0.811119540930491
As regards the second treaty on performances and phonograms, it must be stressed that for the first time an international treaty signed by the Community as well recognises exclusive rights for performers, interpreters and artists for reproduction, distribution and rental to the public, and the right to fair remuneration for radio broadcasts.	0.7543232435530559
In that context a noteworthy and important step forward is the treaty' s treatment of the right of reproduction.	0.6793286142250842
Even though, as the Commission says, the texts of the treaties do not contain special provisions to regulate all the respective issues raised by technological development, it can nevertheless be said that within the legislative framework created, performing or interpreting artists enjoy broader protection than that accorded by the Treaty of Rome or even by the Community directives.	0.8489046033410127
Interpreting Article 7 of the Treaty, we can conclude that the application of protection for reproduction does not only mean protection for the reproduction of the interpretations or performances themselves as such that are embodied in recordings, but also protection against copying, whether in whole or in part and whether permanent or temporary, and protection against any other form of production.	0.7430200653944565
It would be appropriate, however, for us also to mention some points which should be at the focus of future WIPO work or the work of other diplomatic conferences.	0.8646790750540864
First, there is the right of distribution as referred to in Article 8(1).	0.8364090751638882
The option accorded to States by the next paragraph of the same article to regulate the exhaustion of the above right is dangerous and is one of the Treaty' s most negative points, since there is nothing to prevent States from enacting special conditions for the exhaustion of the right, a thing that would be to the disadvantage of artists.	0.8157960591437055
As regards rental rights, on interpretation of Article 9, we can conclude that the exclusive right of rental belongs to artists, interpreters or performers, only if this is laid down by national legislation. I think this conflicts with Article 13.	0.9184346257419083
To conclude, I want to say that ratification of these treaties opens a horizon for property rights.	0.6178430064838921
In the 21st century, the century of knowledge and the invisible economy, intellectual property will be the dominant form of property and will, in many cases, be more important than traditional property.	0.8471022126804464
We are at the dawn of an age in which new legislation will be created, where the right to utilise intellectual property will clash head on with the public interest in terms of its dissemination and exploitation by the public at large.	0.7727704973311597
Mr President, I should like to thank our rapporteur for this excellent report which, nonetheless, concludes that, as a Community, our accession to these two WIPO treaties must not boil down to a mere institutional development, however important that may be, i.e. the opportunity for the European Community and the WIPO Assembly to work together.	1.0324011475362997
This ratification is also necessary in the light of the enlargement of Europe.	0.6765903411281576
However, an objective is emerging behind this issue of Community accession, one I find as yet too theoretical but one that some Member States, nonetheless, find too offensive.	0.7369776170646779
This is the affirmation of a European cultural policy. In this connection, I expect our three institutions, Parliament, the Commission and the Council, to be in agreement.	1.2718567468815407
Cultural policy means, in particular, defending the role of the arts, recognising the role of authors and setting high cultural standards.	0.5893920974059881
In addition, at a time when Europe faces the task of defining a new policy on copyright and neighbouring rights, there is an urgent need - as has just been pointed out several times - to define and redefine what exactly an author is.	0.8879673954844697
Our definitions are still too vague and new technologies now make it essential for us to clarify them.	0.6082091688471151
Mr President, Commissioner, the adoption of the WIPO agreements was a very positive step in the direction of the global information society.	0.8897625432523255
The agreements crystallise the decades-old legacy of copyright, and they represent a precisely considered and balanced solution for the regulation of copyright and neighbouring rights.	0.6118605043808928
The entry into force of the treaties and their final form is, however, in addition to this recommendation, dependent on implementation by the parties themselves.	0.7918761182958234
In the United States the WIPO Treaty has already entered into force, having been enacted into law by means of the Digital Millennium Corporate Act and there they have managed to retain the delicate balance of the Treaty by means of this legislation.	0.7385864143339965
The EU too must proceed in its legislative work in accordance with what is agreed in the WIPO.	0.68122572065767
It is worrying that the position adopted by the previous Parliament does not support this balanced WIPO system.	0.6520383178851604
The opinion on the copyright directive at first reading was very distorted, and, furthermore, the balance is moving in a harmful direction from the point of view of Europeans.	0.7324588316656039
The recommendations that have been made will not improve the status of culture in Europe, on the contrary.	0.8704651154071472
Parliament' s amendments would mainly improve opportunities for the media enterprises that are well established in the market to move their old, in excess of 80% market share to a new environment with rigid, excessive copyright regulations.	0.7271893559005204
I am not now speaking of Charlotte Cederschiöld' s recommendation, which is an excellent paper, but of the matters of copyright that the previous Parliament discussed.	0.9877481904405255
On one point of detail, I would like to thank Mrs Cederschiöld for having clarified, for example, the concept of so-called temporary copies in her opinion.	0.7199477230387417
There is no consciously adopted position in the WIPO Treaty on temporary copies.	0.6653778687947352
If these, which technically speaking are copies, were covered by the protection in force it would make the transfer of information - as the recommendation quite rightly states - expensive and complicated for no good reason.	0.7683048267649701
It would be as if the deliveryman had to pay a copyright fee whenever he carried a book to be read by the purchaser.	0.5311660476742239
The real benefit of culture is that art and knowledge can be transferred safely and easily from the artist directly to the user, the consumer.	0.571283382681176
The new operational environment is, above all, a huge opportunity to create and spread culture in a different way than ever before.	0.6821198003255561
It is essential that the interests of all parties are taken into account.	0.7138758880883264
Parliament has tried to take account of this in its own recommendation.	0.6711345304250914
. (NL) Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on the work that she has carried out.	0.8465733750899797
The Commission is under the impression that she has worked fast and effectively.	0.7853033516356039
This is important.	0.510457914263957
It befits the Commission to express its gratitude towards the rapporteur.	0.7177011610872426
I would like to present the Commission' s conclusion to you without any further ado: it agrees with the conclusions of the draft recommendation and, therefore, with ratification by this Parliament.	0.8030103300503831
I would like to stress the importance of both Treaties.	0.65733382444954
Both the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty constitute progress in the international protection of copyright and neighbouring rights and are, as such, a considerable improvement on the Berne Convention and the Treaty of Rome.	0.7229581037916156
Both Treaties contribute towards a high level of protection for works and other matters, but offer the public access to the contents of these via electronic networks.	0.7135026731023442
The two Treaties explicitly permit the Community to become a party to the Treaties and to play an important role in managing them.	0.7790249285278571
Consequently, approval of the Treaties by the Community is of major importance, because it illustrates that the Community sets great store by intellectual property rights.	0.8926249986809476
In addition, assent leads to more widespread international recognition of the European Union' s role in terms of copyright.	0.6006342072578694
At international level, there is a great deal of support for treaties entering into force more swiftly.	0.7183249862448287
These have now been ratified by twelve or thirteen WIPO Member States, including the United States.	0.6546579015004503
The entry into force of treaties largely depends on the European Union, because thirty ratification acts are required in order for treaties to enter into effect, and these acts that are signed by the European Union and the Member States, including associated countries, are of vital importance in order to reach this number.	0.948933293316176
The developing countries, too, expect the European Union to bring about ratification swiftly because this would give a strong signal worldwide.	0.7980167449102088
In this context, Parliament has already played a key role in the discussions on the draft directive on copyright in the Information Society, which led to the approval of the Barzanti report in February 1999.	0.8942828862116702
This directive is the necessary counterpart of the proposed decision and largely embraces the key principles of the WIPO Treaties.	0.7333411231087905
The European Parliament must now follow once again the exceptional assent procedure of Article 300(3).	0.6859500565261092
It is vitally important to give the correct signal to the outside world, in the form of this recommendation.	0.7319340105652057
In a nutshell, I would like to reiterate the Commission' s conclusion here: it supports the draft recommendation and hopes that it will be of key importance to anyone with an interest in intellectual property.	0.73647818217474
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6002529528362665
The debate is closed.	0.04146649521247962
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30a.m.	0.31984409677608006

Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	0.49227983774613004
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.	0.3276264714268111
Are there any comments?	0.1201495129830156
Mr President, I see in the Minutes that two Members spoke yesterday about delayed flights to Strasbourg on Monday.	0.739890466306563
I would like to add that the flight from Amsterdam' s Schipol airport was also delayed and then cancelled.	0.49741049797300635
We were diverted to Basel-Mulhouse Airport.	0.2286987694369041
We were told that a bus would meet us there on arrival.	0.33552166626044583
In fact, it took 45 minutes after we arrived before the bus appeared at the airport.	0.6102703310496131
We finally got here, on Monday at 8.30 p.m., after some of us had spent more than 12 hours travelling.	0.7170965269410442
This sort of service and difficulty in getting to Strasbourg on a Monday is quite hopeless.	0.45579080522077015
If the French Government insists that we continue to meet in Strasbourg, it could at least ensure, where flights are diverted to Basle, that buses arrive on time to meet the diverted passengers, otherwise it is quite pointless for us to try to arrive here on Monday and attend to any kind of business.	0.8346071429058354
I wonder if that could be added to the Minutes.	0.6124502031158156
Mr President, I was booked on the same flight and I am rather embarrassed to admit that the airline was KLM, our national airline company.	0.9114727807871255
I hope that next time, also if any other airline company is involved, things will run more smoothly.	0.6484565190240525
(The Minutes were approved)	0.0864398819752701
Mr President, I would just like to draw your attention to something that concerns today' s agenda. We decided on Monday that the Council' s statement on the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Geneva Convention was to be postponed.	0.8597341652101533
I would just like to clarify that we will only be talking about the other items on this agenda today, and not about the Geneva Convention.	0.9300289760615049
This item has been postponed until the next part-session in March.	0.48104841161506673
It was erroneously included in today' s agenda.	0.33573759592844643
Mr Swoboda, I can confirm what you have just said and there is, in fact, a printing error.	1.065931720871667
The document that has been distributed contains inaccuracies, because the decision has been taken to postpone the debate.	0.866013990548898
Mr President, I just want to say that, as I was walking in this morning, I noticed two people smoking outside the Hemicycle.	0.9293751832166838
The smell is absolutely disgusting!	0.19726015574653064
Can you please do something about it?	0.5135631973868992
I cannot do anything about it myself, but you are quite right. We need a quick way of educating people, including those who do not obey the rules decided upon in this House.	1.0443642062429543
Regarding the problems caused by air travel delays, perhaps everybody who has had difficulty reaching Strasbourg for the present part-session should form a small group - although I am not sure that it will be small - to discuss the precise nature of the problems encountered.	0.8621985679989763
Coherence of EU policies with development	0.17480384764416868
The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on the coherence of EU policies with development.	0.7941267699925554
Mr President, it is a great pleasure for me to address you for the first time on behalf of the Council presidency, particularly in view of the very important role that the European Parliament is bound to play in the near future, given the need to strengthen development policies at European Union level.	1.0857890778169772
The subject of the statement that I have the honour of presenting to you today, is the coherence of different Union policies with development policy.	0.9085338968335431
I shall, of course, give the Commission an opportunity to add to some of the observations that I shall be making. I would like to start by emphasising the need we all feel, at EU level, to reconcile the extraordinary development and progress that we have seen in many areas of life - not least because of the marked technological impetus over recent years, which has benefited people in all walks of life, throughout the world, in terms of well-being and improvements in living conditions - with the fact that, at the same time, there has been a substantial increase in the pronounced imbalances between some regions and geopolitical areas of the world.	0.9089303471153198
This endangers the stability of the international system and jeopardises peace.	0.6519417871697724
We are all therefore duty-bound to seek to match our policies better to this objective of achieving greater stability and greater balance in the various parts of our planet.	0.7413691189216117
The consequence of all this is a reassessment of development policies in response to the globalisation of economic and financial markets.	0.9344713520199097
A serious imbalance in the functioning of these markets has emerged, which has of course made it necessary to make important adjustments, which in turn inevitably mean new options as regards development policies.	0.8465433788385411
We will therefore find ourselves on the threshold of a new model for development policies which - and I would like to stress this - will require action on our part in four essential areas:	0.8839459052255254
Firstly, there will be a need for more concerted action between all international players, by which I mean donors, requiring greater coordination, greater coherence and improved links between humanitarian aid and development policies; it will also require strengthening of the multilateral system and greater attention being paid to indebtedness and to financing and development problems.	0.7794545938153733
At the same time, however, there will have to be some changes in the framework within which those countries now receiving aid operate, particularly the need to fight corruption and to maintain democracy and good governance as fundamental principles in developing their political systems, together with a need to focus special attention on these countries' own policies for reducing poverty.	0.7999582407262156
The second aspect of this new model for development policies relates to the need for a more integrated approach to development.	1.0108119812904235
This means not just an approach limited to development aid as the sole element of this policy, but a policy that also increasingly takes account of the role of other policies in the spheres of finance, trade and investment. Furthermore, this new model must respect the need for this integrated vision of development to be approached both from a global policy angle and also in the light of the various donor countries' own policies.	0.8465541665308904
A third aspect of this new model that I would like to emphasise is a policy aimed at achieving our objectives.	0.7694070931161782
Since 1995, following a concerted international effort between the main donor states, involving in particular a reflection paper produced by the OECD' s Development Assistance Committee, it has been possible to establish some important objectives by way of guidelines for development policies, both at national and international level.	0.8118703140367038
As you will know, the aim of these objectives is to cut poverty by 50% by 2015, by increasing compulsory schooling, by significantly reducing child mortality rates, and by implementing a raft of social welfare measures with a view to effectively achieving this objective.	0.7850388992112112
This would mean moving away from the situation of extreme poverty in which more than a third of the world' s population lives, and moving away from the extremely poor living conditions suffered by over a billion people. This is an extraordinary state of affairs, which certainly means that if this objective is to be achieved the international community as a whole will have to participate and intervene actively.	0.9737845546235965
And that brings me to the fourth aspect of this new development model that I would like to emphasise. Particularly in recent years, development policies have been regarded as an increasingly global matter, and yet there is apparently a lack of strong international leadership.	0.816944505698646
The concerted actions of the United Nations institutions have played an important role here, as has the Bretton Woods system.	0.8772609526797261
I have in mind, in particular, the important impetus given to this debate by the World Bank, especially through its Comprehensive Framework document, and by the International Monetary Fund, where, for the first time, an institution of this kind has put the problem of reducing poverty at the centre of its policy guidelines and has forged a hitherto unimaginable link, for a body of this type, between debt relief and poverty.	0.9766100142481016
This new role for international organisations on development issues is also a good reason for us to consider the role of the European Union in this context.	0.9388306442844648
The Portuguese Presidency has highlighted the need for the European Union to combine its highly important international role as the main donor with a leading role - and a more active one - in this movement to reform international development policies, and to create greater scope for coordination, in particular with the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods system.	1.1043612137496654
If we are to strengthen the European Union' s role in international development policies, we believe that it is basically necessary to take three kinds of action.	0.8041299701790371
Firstly, we need to make the EU' s development policy more effective.	0.9685134837503664
As you know, an exercise was carried out in 1995 involving an overall assessment of development policies, and the results of this overall assessment exercise were presented during the German Presidency.	0.8260496747554822
The main conclusions emphasised the need for a more coherent EU policy and a more strategic overall EU approach to development issues.	0.8391312612436705
The key aspects were the need for greater coordination and greater complementarity between policies, the need for harmonisation and simplification of the present organisational framework for the Union' s present cooperation policies, the need to make the EU' s aid management more efficient and, in particular, to review its mechanisms for intervention, and also the need to reinforce the assessment system and to introduce greater transparency into the process for granting aid.	0.9059644357140797
A second aspect worth highlighting underscores the need for EU policy and the policies of the Member States to complement each other more.	0.7597926684133869
It is widely known that a significant proportion of aid is today granted under the Member States' national policies, which are not always complementary or well coordinated. A great deal of the waste and inefficiency associated with aid from the European Union and its Member States is the result of precisely this lack of coordination and complementarity between the actions of individual Member States and the proposals and actions of the European institutions.	0.929911482611501
In this respect it is also absolutely vital that we should do our utmost, as soon as possible, to create stronger mechanisms for ensuring that the policies adopted by the Member States and European Union policies are coordinated and complementary.	1.0439399650390138
The third aspect I would like to highlight is the strengthening and coherence of EU policies, the central theme of today' s debate.	0.7563838080724312
Firstly, we are all aware that it is not enough just to improve aid conditions and that there is a need for better coordination with other European Union policies, so that development objectives can be achieved, not merely through aid and support, but also, first and foremost, through a more integrated approach to the various different policies that contribute to the objectives of development.	0.9944795231412045
As you know, a Council Resolution was approved, in June 1997, under which the Commission was required to present evaluation reports.	0.9684686365438774
The first such report was presented to the Council in May 1999, and it referred to certain aspects of policy coordination, notably in the fields of peace building, food safety, fisheries and migration.	0.8460223985517066
But as you will also be aware, we are waiting for a Commission communication on coherence, together with the communication on development policy.	0.9853324501266921
Over the coming months, that is to say during the Portuguese Presidency, this debate will of course be enriched by the contributions that the Commission has undertaken to present to us.	0.9876719725516361
It is evident that the scope for achieving coherence between policies will always be limited and it is only natural for there to be some contradictions between policies as these are means of balancing and weighting the contradictory and conflicting interests within the European Union. Only in this way is it possible to manage some degree of contradiction between policies.	0.7775324082289506
But, quite apart from this, we would like to emphasise that, if we are to strengthen the coherence of European Union policies in the present circumstances and in the economic situation currently facing the Union, we need to give serious consideration to various issues associated with the dynamics of the European Union itself.	1.0828293901340542
By this I mean, of course, the internal dynamics of the European Union.	0.6867115312545423
We know that the European Union has its own dynamics, which stem above all from the Treaty of Amsterdam, which has reinforced its political dimension. This inevitably has important consequences for the proposal for coherence in policies relating to development.	0.9817389835225284
We will also have to await the outcome of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference as regards enlargement, to see to what extent the internal dynamics of the European Union are directed towards increasing the coherence of its policies, and, as regards development in particular, to what extent it also contributes to appropriate institutional arrangements for achieving this objective.	0.9698758817394757
The second aspect that we need to consider, in relation to the coherence of policies, is development policy in the context of the Union' s foreign policy.	0.8822061069713427
We know that the Union has entered a new era as regards its foreign policy, and we know that, with the creation of the High Representative, of the Rapid Reaction Force and of the military crisis management capacity, there is a whole trend towards confirming the status of the European Union that we should not underestimate when we consider the role of development policies. We also know that there are issues associated with political dialogue, with the adoption of common positions or joint actions, with the preparation of joint strategies, with preventive diplomacy, and with the development of regional capacity for crisis prevention and management.	1.0837297689723917
There can be no doubt that implementing and developing all these aspects will inevitably make an important contribution to strengthening the role of development policies in the context of the European Union' s foreign policy.	0.7087085038706665
It has to be said that, in approaching development policy in the context of foreign policy, the European Union is bound to go down the same road as many Member States have done with their own development policies in the context of their individual foreign policies.	0.8799566150704101
The success of this is bound to involve a need to strengthen decision-making mechanisms and institutional structures relating to the common foreign and security policy, so as to secure better coordination between instruments of development policy and instruments of foreign policy.	0.7799767178096024
In this context, we are convinced that we need to move away from the post­colonial model towards to a truly European model of development aid. I say this because we know that, in Europe, development policy has been very much shaped by the policies of certain Member States, in view of the post-colonial concerns of those states.	0.9893575911011254
The third aspect that needs to be considered is European Union policy and Member States' policy.	0.8053140177336532
Coherence of policies at European level certainly means better coordination of Member States' policies with the European Union' s development policy.	0.7931153677176765
If we do not establish improved mechanisms to ensure coherence between national policies, it will certainly be more difficult to deliberate against a background of greater coherence in European Union development policy.	0.7244741050972673
Ladies and gentlemen, the fourth and final aspect that I would like to draw to your attention, regarding development policy, is, of course, the Development Council. There have been discussions, especially in recent months, about the role the Development Council could play in relation to EU policies.	0.9603482976268521
As you know, there is a glaring difference between the status of development policies and other EU policies - you only have to look at the difficult circumstances surrounding the EDF' s financing, or rather lack of financing.	0.7927311983950119
It is difficult to imagine achieving greater coherence in the European Union' s policies without the Development Council playing a more active and interventionist role in relation to political decisions, which clearly come under the development banner and which are being dealt with in other Councils, in other decision-making forums, ranging from the Agriculture and Fisheries Councils to the Environment Council. Up to now, the Development Council has not had any opportunity to make its voice heard or to intervene in relation to these decisions.	0.9160923007402718
So without a more active role for the Development Council in the overall coordination of political decision making which, although it directly impacts on the European Union' s development policy, is largely being dealt with outside this decision-making forum, it will certainly be difficult to establish a more coherent European Union policy on development objectives.	0.9324042243904637
The views of the European Parliament on this issue too, will certainly be both timely and welcome.	1.1574667927101379
. Let me start by saying something about the successfully concluded negotiations between the EU and ACP countries.	0.6613653883519375
I would like to remark that it was a very positive experience taking part in those negotiations.	0.8236002543124648
I saw Member States working as a team, which was indeed a wonderful experience.	0.7048332012491829
There was also deep satisfaction on both sides when this was over, not just because it was over, but because we all knew that we had achieved something together, the EU and the 71 ACP countries.	0.9619788692664529
That is something that the world needs and is a very good signal in the framework of the whole discussion of globalisation.	1.0128092336650547
I shall outline some of the major innovations in the new agreement.	0.8665725515595544
We explicitly address corruption; we establish a framework for dealing with the problem of immigration for the first time ever.	0.7928873834370932
We promote participatory approaches, we ensure the consultation of civil society on the reforms and policies to be supported by the EU.	0.8965006048576817
We refocus development policies on poverty reduction strategies.	0.27964774846037926
We base the allocation of funds not only on an assessment of each country's needs, but also of its policy performance.	0.8608084379661568
We create an investment facility to support the development of the private sector.	0.6940238277319646
We rationalise instruments and introduce a new system of rolling programming, allowing the Community and the beneficiary country to regularly adjust their cooperation programme.	0.654245595377108
We decentralise administrative and, in some cases, financial responsibilities to local level with the aim of making cooperation more effective.	0.6793284889981333
We improve the policy framework for trade and investment development.	0.4341629082993975
We enhance cooperation in all areas important to trade, including new issues such as labour standards and the linkages between environment and trade.	0.6413575981518106
After Seattle I am sure you will appreciate the significance of these agreements.	0.6844988948406906
Let me turn to some of the more important points.	0.6467131215535779
Firstly the agreement on political issues.	0.4400956402964576
The new agreement will entail a firm commitment on both sides to good governance as a fundamental and positive element of the partnership, a subject for regular dialogue in an area which enjoys active Community support.	0.8551394743695503
Secondly, a new procedure has been drawn up for cases of violations of human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law.	0.7637523398474227
In comparison with the current procedure, the new one puts more emphasis on the responsibility of the state concerned and allows for greater flexibility in the consultation process, with a view to conducting an effective dialogue leading to measures to be taken to redress the situation.	0.9027387391840795
In cases of special urgency involving serious violations of one of these essential elements, measures will be taken immediately and the other party will be notified.	0.8621814936862704
Thirdly, the EU and the ACP have also agreed on a new specific procedure to be launched in serious cases of corruption.	0.9112526345890123
This is a real innovation, both in the EU/ACP context and in international relations in general.	0.8879776540984217
This procedure will be applied, not only in cases of corruption involving EDF money, but also more widely in any country where the EC is financially involved and where corruption constitutes an obstacle to development.	0.7540345010367683
It is thus not confined to EC activities.	0.5099369196182209
This is a very important aspect, taking into account the fundability of public finances.	0.8542451870515889
By adopting such a provision in the partnership agreement, the EU and the ACP States are together sending a clear and positive signal that will doubtless be appreciated by European taxpayers and hopefully also by European investors.	0.7407043133368434
Another new theme in the ACP-EU agreement is migration.	0.47239130739330665
We have reached a balanced agreement on cooperation in this area.	0.6710581795464611
This new dimension to the partnership agreement reflects the guidelines espoused by the EU in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam and with the conclusions of the European Council in Tampere in Finland in October 1999.	0.8939403725129054
The European Union undertakes to develop and implement an immigration and asylum policy founded on the principle of partnership with the originating countries and regions.	0.7290426533345296
The agreement concluded with the ACP countries paves the way for new initiatives, in particular on the rights of third country citizens within the EU, and measures facilitating their integration.	0.9287834135714776
We also agreed on provisions to address questions related to illegal immigration.	0.36515193383557343
The EU and the ACP states will initiate the process aimed ultimately at defining, within a framework to be negotiated with each and every ACP country, the ways and means of repatriating immigrants illegally present on the territories of each party.	0.713277425238246
This also covers persons from third countries and stateless persons.	0.44179420427602617
These very innovative approaches provide a good opportunity to improve governance.	0.38725598176079873
The agreement also offers a good framework to underpin the mutually reinforcing effects of trade cooperation and development aid.	0.48005699604716534
We have agreed on a process to establish new trading arrangements that will pursue trade liberalisation between the parties and to formulate provisions on trade-related matters.	0.6817423794461075
We have met the concerns of the ACP states as far as the time-frame of the trade negotiations is concerned.	0.8551917877797736
Negotiations will start no later than 2002.	0.32899807520549984
This two-year preparatory period will be used to strengthen regional integration processes and the ACP countries' capacity to conduct trade negotiations.	0.6049799167458672
A six-year period is programmed for these negotiations.	0.4389705573014375
We will take account of the economic and social constraints of the ACP countries in two ways: firstly, through human and social development policies to accompany economic and trade reforms and, secondly, by helping the ACP states to become active players in the international economic and trade system through capacity-building and cooperation in multilateral forums.	0.841704033013781
This approach will lead us to a fully WTO compatible regime.	0.4934957675431981
Economic operators will be more inclined to establish closer relations with their ACP partners.	0.5678238406549352
Domestic and foreign investment will grow and more know-how and technology will be transferred, all of which will boost the ACP countries' competitiveness and ease their gradual integration into the world economy.	0.6763604843922816
In addition, the agreements with the EU will act as an anchor.	0.8283437681928935
They will lock in the economic reforms, just as national and economic reforms will be stabilised by both parties' commitments under the agreements.	0.6150737931475704
The rationale behind this new approach is also based on the idea that open trade policies combined with social development policies will lead to economic growth and poverty reduction.	0.6787858427971522
Another important aspect is the improvement of the EU' s trade regime for all least-developed countries, 39 of which are actually in the ACP group.	0.7788389092125614
This process will take place in the coming five years so that, by 2005, the LDCs' exporters will have free access for essentially all their products on the EU market.	0.8230107578054561
As regards the volume of the next EDF, the EU has made its financial proposal.	1.0039187926290583
It is based on the principle of reconciling the need to maintain a substantial amount of financial resources in a period of limited official development assistance budgets with the need to make Community aid more effective.	0.76227109069711
Today about EUR 9.5 billion of previous EDF resources are uncommitted.	0.45215917144460155
The EU is committed to mobilising these remaining balances, plus the new EDF resources, over a seven-year period, that is to say, before the entry into force of the next financial protocol.	0.7674734263908389
This will enable the Community to substantially increase annual flows of commitments and payments during this period.	0.522340878390458
We are thus not moving into a period in the coming years of reduced activity, we are moving into a period of increased activity.	0.8066802865302813
Such a commitment entails an in-depth reform of procedures and implementation modalities on both sides.	0.5118679271313114
There is a very real link between the reform process in the Commission as such, and our ability to deliver on the ground which is the basis of the deal with the ACP countries.	1.2183448734020221
Turning to our development policy, I would say that the global context has changed drastically.	0.8786520108489424
The marginalisation of many economies, increased poverty in the world, the need for better management of environmental interdependence, the destabilising effects of migration and the worrying consequences of armed conflicts and pandemic diseases are all major concerns.	0.6892624119701414
It is within this changing global framework that we have to position ourselves.	0.639836764688577
Fortunately evaluations of EC aid give us a meaningful tool to improve what we are doing and also hopefully to meet the challenges I have just mentioned.	0.6687203749975643
To focus on the input coming from the evaluations, I would mention the following problems: the objections of Community policy are too numerous and too vague and this adversely affects coherence.	0.742521081694073
This is due to the complexity of our own structures, but also to very real inconsistencies between sector policies and interests in the Member States.	0.7954913046629423
The Commission has an aid system that is too complex and fragmented in terms of instruments, procedures and institutional mechanisms.	0.7394552921613756
Often policies are more determined by the instruments available, than by policy objectives and clearly-defined priorities.	0.5693003940075428
Human resources are too thin in relation to the volume of aid that we are supposed to manage.	0.6102329364212021
On average, to manage $US 10 million of aid there are 2.9 staff at the Commission, compared with 4.3 at the World Bank and between 4 and 9 in major Member States.	0.6067843184857903
This is a real problem: there are too many different financial instruments, each with its own characteristics and in particular a series of different budget headings.	0.9296627512067723
This is difficult to reconcile with the needs of an effective management system.	0.5473724081886594
In order to face and solve these problems the Community needs to engage in an effective dialogue with Member States and Parliament.	0.7067404697901472
It is absolutely crucial that we tackle the coherence issue in a realistic and pragmatic way, which means holding the debate in the appropriate institutional framework, that is, the Council and Parliament.	1.0491457200005117
The lack of concerted action among the 15 Member States themselves and between them and the Community also needs to be addressed.	0.6526612395794362
By focusing the Community's development policy on internationally agreed targets and strategies we will pave the way for better complementarity with the Member States.	0.5252163863382868
This is very much the line also just presented by Minister Amado.	0.7296756832354551
When we talk policies nowadays, we engage in a process of convergence.	0.930198455750601
This is part of the solution.	0.5446403460471696
We are in the process of formulating new policy guidelines and we need to identify priority areas for Community action.	0.7033284796291416
Everything has become more and more complex.	0.44472334242916434
This is also true of development cooperation.	1.002179209550016
No single donor is in a position to address the whole spectrum of themes, ranging from macro-economic issues to the regulatory framework or from sectoral policies to a variety of new cross-cutting themes such as gender, environment, good governance and institutional reforms.	0.6085390206120773
It is important to find flexible mechanisms that accommodate a division of labour according to the expertise and capacity of the various donors in each developing country.	0.6302630362108604
This should be done at Member State level and should lead to the formulation of sector policies for Community action.	0.7126724731940265
This is where we want to go.	0.8439753658430549
To identify the EC's priority areas of support, account has to be taken of the Community's specific features in relation to the Member States and to international institutions.	0.9086934371892913
I will mention just a few: our ability to combine development policy with trade policy and to ensure synergies between aid and economic cooperation; our neutrality and defence of overall Community interests; the fact that we represent a critical mass and are able to do relatively large jobs compared to what individual Member States can normally do.	0.6560917783813072
Also, our presence on the ground: basically, I find the biggest value we represent is the very fact that being a successful regional cooperation endeavour ourselves, we are seen as a neutral, welcome partner for this experiment world-wide - something which nobody else can claim to be.	0.8000144647938069
It is vital to make Community policy more effective and to develop a more operational strategic framework.	0.7432160551509156
It is this dual challenge that the Commission has to take up, by framing in the months ahead a proposal for a general policy statement.	1.0260813069169805
We will launch a broad and open consultation process in order to get the views of all the different parties interested.	0.8731590060807303
I see the process not quite but almost as important as the content and we will put all our resources into participating actively and we invite everybody to participate.	0.6611668147919503
Parallel to this we have also embarked on the process of improving coherence and clarifying and bringing to the surface and into the open the real or imaginary problems we are having in this respect.	0.6725299339368357
This will be an ongoing process which I see as a kind of continued quality control effort and I invite Parliament to participate in this ongoing effort to improve the coherence of what we are doing.	0.794806048253628
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr Amado and Mr Nielson.	0.825010080793264
I am pleased that Mr Amado talked about the EDF.	0.6531934037502789
The problem, however, should not be sought within this Parliament or the Commission; it is the Council that needs to make a decision on the EDF budget. This sermon, therefore, really belongs in the Council.	1.0221076805113989
Mr President, I thank Mr Nielson.	1.0911724999012593
He has talked extensively about the new Lomé Convention, although this is not really the topic of this morning' s meeting.	0.9173191637293511
We want to talk about coherence.	0.6915782859554943
This is the topic.	0.8480556569746828
Ever since the early nineties, the European Parliament, the European Commission and the European Council of Ministers have recognised that this coherence of European policy is leaves something to be desired, especially in the field of development cooperation and in other EU policies.	1.1008554697629334
This problem has been highlighted on several occasions, to whit in 1992, in 1995 and 1997.	0.7967842963478288
The examples are all quoted in a resolution which lies before us.	0.5534419129069929
I have raised questions regarding this issue for years now.	0.6162020163705422
In fact, the obligation for coherence of policy was even included in the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997.	0.7748740356115895
In 1998, it was agreed that the European Commission should publish an annual report which highlights any improvements.	1.0966578639180378
But what have we seen since then?	0.2637463938768222
Fine words, as is the case again today, but no report. It is too crazy for words, really.	1.1342608029910917
It is a fact that we are dealing with contradictory policy. Time and time again, good intentions are formulated but nothing is implemented.	0.7963098482376457
It is, therefore, with good reason that we bring this up here today.	0.6649028587536789
I would like to give you a few examples to illustrate these contradictions.	0.749123687709188
A number of developing countries grow sugar cane for sugar production.	0.4055018386329519
In the Union, sugar is produced from sugar beet.	0.4632072734924497
In order to prevent this cheap sugar from the developing countries from competing with the more expensive EU sugar, a considerable import levy is imposed on cane sugar.	0.6755284586568989
The result is that the export of cane sugar from the relevant countries to the Union is significantly restricted.	0.8449920753716189
At the same time, we give these countries an enormous amount of development aid.	0.6755858393010595
A Minister from one of the Caribbean islands which produce sugar cane once told me: If you just allowed our sugar access to the European Union, we would not need your development aid at all.	0.7747296723880038
Another example is cacao.	0.2279212382735957
The European Union intends to permit 5% of alternative fats in chocolate in order to harmonise the internal market.	0.6069350198806612
This could just as well be 0% - the internal market would still be harmonised.	0.7852346334543588
By pitching the percentage level at 5%, which is now likely to be the case, it is almost certain that hundreds of thousands of small cacao farmers in developing countries will be put at a disadvantage.	0.8248986311490044
It seems to be heading this way nevertheless.	0.6984317186646946
What are we actually doing then?	0.498378754838536
This is also typical of a policy which makes citizens wonder what Brussels actually does?	0.6191335545583978
It seems that European industry is more important here than our own principles, our own coherences and the interests of the developing countries.	0.7900421770059218
There are also shocking examples in terms of sanctions and embargoes.	0.5673011256125814
Why institute an oil boycott against Haiti and not against Burma, where an elected President is imprisoned, parliament has been sent home and some of the MPs have been put in jail or even murdered?	0.6664454890226037
Why not institute an oil boycott against Sudan, where a great deal of the fighting is still going on, with weapons, no less, funded by the oil companies which are based in the same areas where the refugees are?	0.8568907614491974
The inconsistency is astonishing.	0.09862980899420189
Here too, Mr Nielson mentioned another good example regarding the new Lomé Convention.	0.6721016158590795
If the new Lomé Convention is simply put into operation, without eradicating all these inconsistencies from the policy, the policy will then be built on shifting sands - to use a biblical expression.	0.8699714538719375
The Council has quoted examples of inconsistency time after time: in agriculture, commerce, in conflict prevention, in the peace operations, in the fisheries sector, migration and environment.	0.8856473540242595
Mr Nielson, what we are waiting for is a good report on these inconsistencies and a number of specific proposals to eliminate these from the policy.	0.81496288871029
Once again, all your fine examples, your marvellous policy - and I include the Secretary of State in this - will otherwise be built on shifting sands and will not really come off the ground.	0.7941656592673347
This is also at the request of the citizens.	0.890354800831463
We have been saying this ourselves since back in 1992: this is the topic of this debate.	0.9291656358717502
I hope the message strikes home and I really hope that you will soon produce a report which contains measures.	0.8306535144077793
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following the same line as Mrs Maij-Weggen, I believe that we have a number of representatives here who all feel passionate about contributing to this debate.	0.7018608301629295
The topic touches the very core of the European Union.	0.4704070462512328
Let me begin by specifying precisely what we are debating. Article 178, Title XX of the consolidated Treaties of the European Union reads as follows: "The Community shall take account of the objectives referred to in Article 177 in the policies that it implements which are likely to affect developing countries" .	0.7136815792010607
What are the objectives which each EU policy needs to take into account?	0.7594404996828356
Article 177 specifies these objectives as "sustainable economic and social development of the developing countries, and more particularly the most disadvantaged among them" , the "smooth and gradual integration of the developing countries into the world economy and the campaign against poverty in the developing countries" .	0.8143987352485067
Mr President, these are no arbitrary objectives. These are articles, statutory articles, which form part of the European acquis established by law with which the European institutions and Member States must comply.	1.0859517816997024
Every statutory article should, of course, not just be judged on its regularity, but also on the importance of its contents.	0.8560446681597285
I am of the opinion - and luckily I am not alone in this - that the principle of policy coherence is essential to every government which aims to be a credible servant of its citizens.	0.863744777915533
The interests of the citizens are only served by a credible and reliable government.	0.7639442860638098
This is important if the government wants to gain the trust of society, and also important from the point of view of effectiveness, for coherence is required in order to use the restricted means efficiently.	0.9374438435954204
We should not make reality out to be more rose-tinted than it really is.	0.7377881283778932
Reality is obstinate.	0.13525752290854157
It is up to the government to deal with this fact in a transparent and open manner, without any backhandedness.	0.8707469786438186
The government is obliged to show up any of its dilemmas, and to show where, when and why, problems occur with coherence of policy, rather than sweeping it all under the carpet.	0.8687712350517156
What we are talking about here today is not an issue which can be toyed with at leisure.	0.8834976713945007
Poverty in the third world is a harrowing problem that demands urgent attention.	0.584371847990633
It is only natural that we in Parliament guard the interests of our citizens, but it is also in the interest of our citizens to live in a stable, international environment, in which the goal of human safety is pursued.	1.0756184736430117
This is a moral interest, a safety interest and is, ultimately, even in the interest of our economy.	0.9035870718749104
In whose interest is it really if European taxpayers' money is used to support economic development in Namibia, and if, at the same time, the economic activity of poor cattle farmers in the same country is drastically undercut by rigorous export subsidies, financed by the same tax payers?	0.7598048939278563
We are all acting as if this is not really happening, but we all know that it is.	1.219456761114967
It is not our task as MEPs to adopt an ostrich policy and bury our heads in the sand.	0.6266264387474356
The general interest of policy coherence is, therefore, a responsibility of the Commission as a whole, of the Council, and of the European Parliament.	1.1532398413709932
This responsibility cannot only be borne by the Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, however much we like to see him or hear him talk, or by the Development Council or the parliamentary Committee on Development and Cooperation.	0.9441875321723564
What we need here is an integral approach.	0.715164926166507
After the lucid and closely reasoned explanation of this approach presented by both Mr Amado and Mr Nielson, I would like to note that we are very much looking forward to the proposals, not only by Mr Nielson, but by the entire Commission, in order to make the policy coherent as a whole.	0.926693890975162
This is why we urge the Commission, in this sharp and clear resolution, to develop specific instruments.	1.0284726660547623
We need to pinpoint, and draw up an inventory of, the problem areas for coherence.	0.9455848162333723
We need to make it evident which problems we are solving and which we have not yet solved.	1.060978457642685
This is why I advocate a monitoring centre for coherence which makes this apparent.	0.6343347127593317
This is why we need to set up inter-service task groups in the Commission, in the Council and in Parliament which can police the attainment of coherence.	1.0078383952808931
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if our neighbour' s roof is leaking, we can lend him pots and pans to collect the water, but it is, of course, more effective to help him plug the leak in the roof.	0.7104852061291614
The crisis in last year' s Commission has been solved today, but the Commission must now produce a policy in which we get full support for a coherent approach, which, no doubt, the entire Parliament will soon demand in the resolution.	1.0419173523905387
I would wish the Commissioner all the best in his battle within the Commission and wish Mr Amado the same within the Council.	0.6951878034107142
Mr President, let us be clear from the outset: when it comes to cooperation, coherence is far from being the watchword.	0.8700638626666929
The Treaties provide for the European Union to help developing countries to develop but, as the previous speakers have explained so well, there are various distortions to these declarations.	0.9598805440960568
The first area of incoherence is the lack of consultation between the Union and the Member States on individual cooperation policies.	0.743952435601395
This gives rise to serious malfunctions, because some Community programmes duplicate national programmes, whereas they might have helped other projects about which nothing is done.	0.5983548188342069
And let us not forget that the de facto neo-colonial policy of certain Member States does nothing to help the countries which they are supposedly helping to develop.	0.6826567164380929
The second area of incoherence is aid to authoritarian regimes.	0.5106085890897962
We state that good governance and an end to corruption are mandatory but we continue to pour hundreds of thousands of euros into Swiss bank accounts via the portfolios of a number of Heads of State.	0.5462171039558398
The third area of incoherence is human rights.	0.4211216002641007
We say that we want to protect human rights.	0.8230852380757165
We encourage developing countries to respect human rights.	0.49148064674400227
We even adopt numerous resolutions condemning every violation of human rights.	0.30527199221135176
We ally ourselves with demonstrations and international campaigns.	0.25849283566651077
And yet, at the same time, we allow the arms trade to proliferate and do not even attempt to limit the trade in the most atrocious forms of arms such as anti-personnel mines.	0.7642851317025163
Nor do we do much to really prevent human rights violations.	0.41979548741728784
The fourth area of incoherence in the European Union' s cooperation policy is this: how do you expect to help development by pillaging the natural resources of the people you are helping.	0.6855192525955495
The European Union must leave fish for local fishermen to feed local populations instead of systematically destroying maritime resources through intensive fisheries.	0.5072768001829445
We must leave raw materials so that local manufacturers can process them.	0.333121971649535
I will not even mention oil; we are all aware of the policy of groups such as Elf and Total in Africa.	0.8736415131974513
Furthermore, and this will perhaps soon be the fifth area of incoherence, we demand respect for biodiversity, for example so that everyone can produce from their own seeds and preserve the richness of nature; but at the same time, and this was apparent during recent negotiations, we force ACP countries to sign TRIPS agreements.	0.8830128783912442
These agreements risk being extended to living organisms, which would mean the death of biodiversity and the return of de facto slavery for small-scale farmers in the south, at the hands of the multinationals.	0.7978289868310818
And yet, and this is the sixth area of incoherence, we do not defend the application of the current Treaties.	1.0033741122160214
On the one hand, we vote for a budget line for the fight against AIDS and, on the other hand, we do nothing to ensure compliance with mandatory licences within the framework of the very same TRIPS, despite the fact that this would allow developing countries to produce their own medicines and halt the AIDS massacre.	0.8628087354962052
Similarly, during the WTO negotiations, at a time when, to quote the second paragraph of the Schwaiger report, "the current trade liberalisation process has not yet brought significant benefits for large parts of the population of developing countries, especially the poor" , the European Union continues to defend the liberalisation of trade and intends to put an end to the system of favouring ACP countries, albeit with a transitional period of several years, instead of strengthening it, especially for the poorest countries.	0.8905494610273664
The eighth area of incoherence is of a political and practical nature.	0.8318226065063917
We are always saying think globally, act locally.	0.3743191782258531
And yet we disregard local development agencies and prefer to negotiate with national governments and subsidise northern NGOs at the expense of local programmes and southern NGOs.	0.4775358400982321
And what about agriculture and the environment? Still more problems, still more areas of incoherence which I might have highlighted, not to mention research, emigration or health.	0.8405366549877267
In short, we claim that we want to help developing countries and, at the same time, we encourage the liberalisation of trade, which we acknowledge runs counter to that very objective.	0.8866019757770747
I say it again, the European Union' s cooperation and development policy is not coherent. and on behalf of the Green Group I call on Parliament, the institutions and the Commission to make a joint effort, at long last, to put some coherence into our policy.	1.107306521164187
Mr President, I feel that this debate is particularly timely and appropriate, not just because development is in general an important issue, but because it is also a topical one.	1.1688122016827431
Seattle was a failure, and north-south relations were in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons.	0.7604950862328244
The meeting held in that North American city demonstrated that globalisation is having seriously unbalanced and negative effects on poorer countries.	0.45116394361616724
The Tenth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development is being held right now in Bangkok, and is suffering the consequences of that failure.	0.8036696295709994
In the meantime, however, as has already been mentioned, the negotiations on the future of the Lomé Convention have been concluded.	0.9003545400822477
This goes to show just how topical this subject is.	0.5030371213408679
We could also add to the list the next EU-OAU summit which it has finally been agreed to hold in Cairo in April.	0.6096930160150242
However, I would also like to add that any analysis, no matter how superficial, inevitably leads us to the conclusion that something - or even a great deal - is amiss with north-south relations, including those between the European Union and the less developed countries.	0.9754802323506089
You only have to realise that the category of "least developed countries" has grown from 25 to 48 countries over the last 30 years, and now represents 13% of the world' s population, yet this category only accounts for 0.4% of world exports and 0.6% of world imports or be aware of the unfortunate fact that official development aid from rich countries has fallen by around 23% since 1990.	0.6972867202982613
Furthermore, the recent Community budget cuts in this area, for the present financial year, are part of this trend, as well as sending an undesirable and misguided political message.	0.9098779824852442
Michel Camdessus, a fair man who is still director of the International Monetary Fund, said in his speech at the opening of the UNCTAD conference, and I am now quoting, that the international community gives with one hand and takes away with the other. He was of course talking about the aid granted by developed countries to less developed countries.	0.9254660403048545
It may seem ironic that this statement should come from someone in his position, but he did indeed say this, and I heard it with my own ears.	0.8732913943356454
This comment certainly seems to me to reflect the current situation, and I accordingly wish to stress that it is vital to rethink north-south relations and break the mould.	0.8573380760896961
In particular, we need to reconsider the role of the European Union in this area, as I am certain that one of the Union' s strategic objectives must be to promote a new and more equitable world order. It is therefore essential to review the present process of globalisation, bearing in mind the underlying approach and dominant interests on which it is based, and to consider the enormous and damaging effect that it is having on the less developed countries, particularly in this context.	0.9948795994964796
A new agreement has been reached with the ACP countries.	0.6452338076889791
This is a positive development in itself, especially given the pressures to terminate it and the fact that various Member States did not wish it to continue.	0.7373984508122056
We will have an opportunity in due course to consider the exact terms of this agreement in greater depth, but meanwhile there is no doubt that the European negotiators were more timid and failed to live up to the proposals that we formulated at the appropriate time, even if the new agreement does include some new and innovative points.	0.9423903314503095
Certain politically important aspects of the new partnership agreement will have contributed to these.	0.7091709083570088
This was without a doubt the result of a complex negotiating process in which both parties made major concessions, and this is certainly true of the European Union, especially in the field of good governance and trade.	0.8574209472077602
But it was above all the result of a stronger ACP group, which obviously found new courage following the events in Seattle.	0.8191009297719114
I particularly wish to stress that a new way of looking at these issues seems to be emerging, especially as regards trade, and it is certainly necessary to tackle this area.	0.900597275744214
Lastly, we need to go further in our development aid policies towards developing countries.	0.8070688433122728
I have in mind budgetary and financing aspects, indebtedness, assistance in sensitive areas such as food safety, humanitarian, educational and health-related issues, and also fields such as the environment, investment and access to information and new technologies. This also applies to the sphere of trade, where we need to ensure real coherence between development policies and other Community policies, and also between both types of policy and corresponding policies originating in the Member States.	0.8205674362596159
We cannot simply forge ahead with something that in the past has shown itself to be inappropriate and wrong-headed.	0.7585125951502524
Mr President, having listened to the Council and the Commission today, I just had to look at my agenda.	1.0975153139401976
Yes, it does say: 'Coherence of different Union policies with development policy' .	0.7688917118709585
But we have not heard a single word on this subject, and I find that deeply embarrassing.	1.0864544464842534
We have been waiting for a report on coherence for years.	0.8491338799600275
It ought to have been here in writing today and, after having heard Mr Nielson' s speech, I can well imagine that he is up against a lot of powerful opposition in the Commission.	0.9961574200340776
I know that the Commissioner himself has some strong and extremely reasonable opinions on coherence, and these are what I should like to have heard expressed here today.	0.8710729729102719
Because the joint motion for a resolution proposes a range of effective mechanisms for ensuring coherence, I shall use the very short time allotted to me here just to mention one more such mechanism, namely obliging the Commission to carry out an evaluation of new, relevant legislation from this aspect.	0.8323734588865
I also want to focus on the catastrophic effect the EU' s common agricultural policy has had on developing countries: dumping of beef in Sahel and South Africa, tomato purée in West Africa and milk powder in Jamaica.	0.5288646740401378
The examples are, I hope, all well known. In any case, they are known all too well to the producers in the ACP countries who are affected by these measures and who have to destroy their products because they cannot compete with EU-subsidised products.	0.8650816257083012
European taxpayers contribute EUR 40 billion per year in support of agriculture in the EU.	0.46860690000630145
This is money which is helping to impede the development of the agricultural sector in the developing countries, which accounts for 69% of the total work force there compared with 1.7% in the EU.	0.7756544219168231
Add to this the fact that the agricultural sector accounts for 34% of the developing countries' gross national product, compared with 5.3% in the EU.	0.7434022057685103
There is neither coherence nor human decency here.	0.2632214930890503
Why will neither the Council nor the Commission admit the fact?	0.367382361702987
Mr President, how policy decisions are arrived at is surely fundamental.	0.622004235675565
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and his Foreign Secretary yesterday made statements on their policy in regard to the voting system within the Council.	0.7051394979279757
They pointed out that the UK, France and Germany far exceed the other countries of the European Union at present in terms of population.	0.7837400906760732
They then drew the conclusion that population size should be reflected in the voting system and that the United Kingdom would not surrender its veto.	0.7361635609019428
Is the Council discussing this issue?	0.6188845691420732
Is it prepared to maintain a democratic veto based on population strengths or is it still moving towards a simple majority vote of Council members, rather than a vote reflecting the population in Europe which they democratically represent?	0.625461119875948
Have the UK representatives indicated to the Council their decision and proposal and what, if any, consideration has been given to it?	0.7706980381651971
As this voting matter is vital to the democratic future of this Union, surely it should receive priority consideration.	0.6921801199540992
How decisions are made is all-important.	0.4449116474714928
co-president of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly. Mr President, I thank the Council and the Commission for their statements this morning, but I will concentrate on coherence policy because that is what the agenda says we are talking about.	0.976685811487887
Much as I agree with the requirement to hold a debate on the coherence of different Union policies and development policy, I question whether today is the time to be holding it.	0.9430394482957675
However, the Council statement gave me hope for the future.	1.0071359422702018
It is quite obvious to me, as someone who specialises in development policy, that there are many areas where lack of coherence is dramatically affecting developing nations.	0.9779099608104018
I will give some examples shortly.	0.6079271556153353
However, I remind this House that, back in June 1997, a Council resolution acknowledged the fact that there is a serious lack of coherence in some of the EU policies in relation to its development cooperation policy.	0.9924080379644118
This was followed by a request from the Council to the Commission to provide an annual report, the first of which was to be discussed in 1998.	1.2200083717224537
We still await the first report, and that is why I believe this debate was premature, as the Commission had little to say on coherence this morning.	1.1671213921825652
The areas identified by the Council are specific areas where policy coherence is particularly important, such as peace-building, conflict prevention and resolution, food security, fisheries and immigration.	0.7926010821604469
Some of these issues have been discussed in depth.	1.0656755752370837
I personally feel that issues such as peace-building and conflict prevention and resolution are very much the domain of African Heads of State, with capacity support from the European Union and the OAU acting as arbiter.	0.8275109054185326
The issues that are really affected by lack of coherence are in areas such agriculture, trade, environment and biodiversity, but herein lies the real problem: these are the highly sensitive areas of policy within the European Union as a whole and in this Parliament in particular.	0.9597196830409576
Members of this House will have differing views, even within the same political parties, depending on (a) which country they come from or (b) which committee they sit on.	0.7887008554323971
There are areas of coherence I would like to see as a member of the Committee on Development that would probably horrify some of the members of the Committee on Agriculture or Committee on Fisheries.	0.8615401669116406
As a lack of coherence, one can cite as Mrs Sandbæk did, the exporting of milk products to Jamaica at prices far below production costs there which has almost ruined the Jamaican dairy industry.	0.5409525754537079
We have beef exported to southern Africa, to Namibia and South Africa, which then sell their indigenous beef to Swaziland, so that Swaziland can fill its export quota back to the European Union.	0.6474448071577392
Remember too, some countries blocked an agreement with South African trade for four years.	0.6794736240635947
If we simply import raw materials from these developing countries, rather than allowing them the add-on value of producing their finished articles in their own country, we deny them the very poverty-eradication that we have set as our top principle in helping developing nations.	0.654184386145029
I am not surprised the Commission is having trouble producing a basic document for discussion on sustainable and social development.	0.7622832460994133
There is a natural resistance in the developing world to anything that would lower standards of living and create further unemployment.	0.6585325080624176
I wish the Commission well in its task of producing that basic document.	0.3823869241154321
Mr President, this morning' s debate is very important.	1.0735959942695539
I therefore thank the Commission and the Council for having made a statement on the coherence of Community policies in relation to development, because this demonstrates a will to make policy in this area more effective.	0.9595764632402706
However, if we are simply carrying out a diagnosis of the incoherences in our policy, we will end up totally frustrated and, furthermore, the result will be negative.	0.9208906462869356
As with the systems of forces which are studied in basic physics, it makes no sense to implement policies which will cancel each other out.	0.7082804384755226
The result of this absurd game is not zero, but rather a minus number, as a consequence of the material, financial and human resources thrown away in a pointless enterprise.	0.8528209432246672
With regard to policy, this minus number is multiplied by the number of results which are not achieved each time one measure cancels out the intended effect of another.	0.6293872938159429
In today' s globalised world, this fact is all the more obvious.	0.7341412839193069
There are no boundaries for Community policies.	0.5498909897993153
I am therefore glad that the Commission and the Council are once again taking an interest in the coherence of Community policies, and that, together with complementarity between national and Community policies and coordination between the services of the Commission, they intend to shape the policy on cooperation in accordance with the development of the European Union.	0.9823292285894796
Both the Commission and the Portuguese Presidency of the Council state, in their respective working programmes, that they wish to give coherence to those policies which have a very important impact on the developing countries, but they do not specify concrete measures aimed at introducing this coherence.	1.0798237233566919
Both institutions identify the most important areas where this idea should be applied.	0.636505492320324
For example, the Commission, in its long term guidelines, says that the objective of sustainable development must be based on a strong sense of solidarity, supported by a commercial policy which takes common interests into account.	0.8758583435159298
The Commission is addressing a very important area, that is, commercial policy.	0.9145898360118512
However, this Parliament wishes to add policies to aid development, agriculture, fisheries policy, immigration, our position in international financial institutions, the common foreign and security policy and aid for structural reform.	0.8618321208857509
The Council - and Mr Luis Amado has said this this morning - has spoken on different occasions of the need for coherence - the last time, it is true, being in November 1999, and also on other occasions, such as the Development Councils of May 1999 and June 1997 - but with no concrete results.	0.9322370702298751
Since the Development Council is in agreement with what he says - and this is very significant - there is little we can say, as some previous speakers have pointed out.	1.0630363902857591
However, as Parliament, we wish to propose - as others have said and as the resolution states - the creation of an inter-service working group consisting of the people responsible for all the policies mentioned and the establishment of a monitoring centre for the coherence of the different Community policies, which is capable of anticipating the effects of each policy on the developing countries and amongst themselves.	0.9947727484930093
What we really want, however, is to be realists and not hide away from the fact that the achievement of these objectives of coordination, complementarity and, the most complex one, which we are discussing at the moment, coherence, will require a more developed policy than the one we currently have in the European Union.	1.019903895933778
Let us hope - and we do hope - to be guided by the winds of change created by the Intergovernmental Conference, the reform of the Commission - which will also affect the development services -, this new legislature and the prospects for enlargement, to perfect a more coherent political union.	1.036345360483626
We therefore hope that the Commission, in the report it is going to present to us on global policy, will also address the question of coherence as an integral element in the efficient use of Community resources and the specific management of public interests.	0.9944723050083455
Mr President, I too should like to thank the Council and the Commission for their reports and, in common with others, express my regret at the fact that coherence policy has not been given more prominence.	0.9691280774319432
But we who sit here in Parliament do not doubt for a second what the reason is.	0.6259093131000322
I should therefore like to discuss something more general and begin with a couple of, in my view, useful figures.	0.6591973138036222
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, real per capita income in the world' s richest countries was three times higher than in the poorest countries. In 1900 it was ten times higher and in the year 2000 it is 60 times higher.	0.7642645060252891
And there is no sign of this trend' s being reversed.	0.7565283484186627
On the contrary, it looks as if we have entered an exponential curve which is widening the gap still further. This is shown by the following figures: the income gap between the richest and poorest fifths was 30:1 in 1960, 60:1 in 1990 and 74:1 in 1997.	0.6734086310206294
These figures are from before the Internet revolution took off.	0.3836470291754128
In other words, there will have to be a quantum leap in development policy if the rich countries, including the EU countries, are not to surround themselves with barriers to prevent immigration on a massive scale.	0.9461138200223271
In a global village, major discrepancies in the world will not, in the longer term, be tolerated by the poorest section of the village.	0.8105560395984961
At some time or another, there will be a revolt, and it will be fully justified.	1.08386636206841
I would therefore urge the Council' s Presidency to set the promised debate in motion as quickly as possible and, above all, to conclude it in such a way that we all of us, including the people of Europe, realise what globalisation means and understand that a central element will have to be radical changes in the nature and the level of the development aid we provide.	0.9020938344969509
The EU on average is far from providing the pledged 0.7%.	0.39704960619724505
It may well be that others are worse, but that does not place us in any better a light.	0.7670428712258732
Above all, however, we should give the countries concerned the opportunity to trade with us.	0.9411628555543949
As far as I could hear - but I may have missed something - the President-in-Office of the Council did not mention the word "trade" at all.	0.8492279566144569
I would just say to the Commissioner that I hope his proposal will be successfully adopted by the Commission and the Member States. I would also ask the Commissioner to give some concrete examples of sectoral interests which are holding matters up, not only in the Commission but also in the Member States.	1.1143442098017209
I should also like to say that, in my view, what would be most effective would be for Parliament to call for proposals from, respectively, the Development Council and the Commissioner for Development. In that way, we should perhaps have a basis for discussion, instead of receiving proposals from all the governments and from all over the Commission, which is scarcely likely to produce results.	1.012033747876095
I shall conclude with a few words about the Internet revolution.	0.8583718411210913
As Commissioner Liikanen keeps saying on his travels, we have a head start here in Europe in the area of mobile telecommunications.	0.8787382867833745
Let us use this not only for the benefit of our own populations but also for that of the developing countries.	0.7727881192902335
This technology can facilitate that necessary quantum leap forward in development policy to which I referred and, in this connection, the EU can set the agenda, leave its mark on development and honour its global responsibilities.	0.849144242797911
Mr President, "The EU' s development cooperation leaves a great deal to be desired" .	0.8212437783936156
This is just a quote from a newspaper article which appeared last week, commenting on the Union' s development policy.	0.49567462108253574
This is not new.	0.7252782913177136
Ever since we have attempted to do something about development cooperation, its effectiveness and quality have been called into question.	0.7338835941826118
Hope of improvement threatens to be nipped in the bud if the Commission keeps refusing to look into the mirror.	0.5492713997067733
Why was the critical report on the coherence of development policy not disseminated externally?	0.5533126812309964
One of the major conclusions of this report concerned the European policy' s internal conflict.	0.9053518506080124
In terms of trade and agriculture, in particular, the European policy is in conflict with the development policy.	1.0969447824048706
We seem unable to make a serious contribution to the development of the least developed countries.	0.8358399307941049
This has everything to do with the difference of opinion which exists among various countries within the Union regarding development cooperation.	0.6321357531460826
We should no longer view development cooperation as an instrument of external and foreign relations, but as a policy in its own right.	0.9050935594578765
I advocate transparent, joint and efficient development policy.	0.33471080231328815
As long as the European approach to the development issue creates more inefficiency and wastes more money, it remains appropriate to apportion a larger role to the Member States.	0.7772989309383266
Finally, I would like to ask the Commission to send the document I referred to to the European Parliament as soon as possible, so that we can help think of possible solutions in a constructive way.	0.9295950361062402
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that this is an appropriate initiative and that it makes very good sense.	1.0272753372492982
As various Members have already commented, we often encounter situations where there is an enormous contradiction between our intentions in terms of development and cooperation policy and the damage we inflict with our other sectoral policies, whose objectives run counter to development in those countries.	0.8580924795555802
And we are not just talking about the concrete impact of our common policies, tourism, the environment, agriculture, fisheries and industry.	0.9300005378774695
We are talking in general terms - and this is more serious - about contradictions between our economic and trade policies and our defence policies.	0.9302692538617335
So there is a whole raft of contradictions.	0.5535828568366136
In my opinion, these contradictions are not all that serious in terms of Community policies. They are, if anything, more serious as regards certain objectives and industries in some Member States.	0.8784525712367328
We have to be aware of this.	1.083427542297421
We often adopt resolutions on peace processes in other parts of the world, as was recently the case with Indonesia, when we protested at the top of our voices only to discover subsequently that some European countries had been supplying them with arms and military equipment.	0.6935415368869311
For me, these are the most serious contradictions in all this, more serious than the contradictions inherent in any incompatibility between sectoral policies.	0.8219986923123185
We obviously know that, even within any one country, there are always contradictions between various policies.	0.8486658082305392
That is a fact of life.	1.0255593827777065
And we must also be aware that there will be contradictions between the various Community policies, in this case development policy.	1.2227508420450863
We have to be aware that these contradictions exist and that we need to minimise them. The underlying reason for presenting this resolution is that the objective of minimising these contradictions is a fair and wise one.	0.931000556785305
I believe that it is both proper and fitting to set up a centre for monitoring this coherence between Community policies and development and cooperation policy, and that this monitoring centre' s sphere of activity should not be limited just to Community policies, but should also cover Member States' actions and policies, including the actions of economic groups, which I think are also important.	1.0051531071765596
This monitoring centre should draw up an annual report on developments in these policies and on their impact and interaction.	0.6247525555654738
I have left to the end a question that I regard as fundamental and which I think needs to be noted and approved by this House.	0.7899439601841222
Our objective of minimising contradictions between development and cooperation policy and other policies has to be a valid objective, not merely within the European Union, but also at world level, given the increasing globalisation of the economy.	0.9600568224419288
If we want fair world trade we will have to gain acceptance for this principle during the next WTO round of multilateral negotiations, because it would be contradictory if the European Union imposed a rigid but fair discipline on itself, only for the United States and the other major powers to do the opposite and to take advantage of our restraint.	0.8924303623367947
That is why I consider it to be essential - and fair - for these principles to be established at the next WTO round.	1.0446648426832206
Mr President, the Director-General of the DG for Development has said that to produce a report on coherence of EU policies with development policies, before this spring' s paper on development policy itself, is like putting the cart before the horse.	0.8375993419635366
Never mind that the Commission' s requirement to produce an annual report, set out clearly in the Council resolution, has produced only one "non-paper" , the real problem here is that at the time of rising world poverty this particular horse is climbing uphill and the cart of other EU policies is so heavy that development policy is actually being pulled slowly backwards.	0.7781466545505196
Time after time development policy is forgotten or is an afterthought when the major policies of this European Union are considered.	0.6841626541087751
Take the new chocolate directive, which shows that EU countries spend more on chocolate every year than on development aid.	0.5720282220138634
There has been no proper development assessment of this directive which the producer countries, 90% of which are our ACP partners, estimate could cut incomes to cacao farmers by at least 15%.	0.7403308748365843
Take the fishing agreements, where we recognise the unsustainability of current fishing practices within the EU waters.	0.7238481923900723
We are, at the same time, negotiating joint ventures allowing increased access for Europe' s large-scale fishing vessels in developing country waters at the expense of 190 million small-scale fish workers in those countries world-wide.	0.479657592014399
Take the trade agreements.	0.260437754429705
As Mr Nielson said this morning with regard to Lomé, preferential access is only for "essentially all the products of the least-developed countries" .	0.6420498414236756
In other words, when EU commercial interests are concerned, poverty considerations go out of the window.	0.6934848502181963
In the stance that we took at Seattle, why such a silence on the EU' s failure to implement the trade concessions for developing countries already agreed in the GATT, including for the crucial textile sector?	0.6458008458984257
On the common agricultural policy, the biggest culprit - no development impact assessment of the Agenda 2000 CAP reforms.	0.8979993781227201
Everyone now knows of the scandal of the export refund scheme which dumped 54 000 tonnes of excess subsidised beef on West African markets, slashing prices for local cattle farmers by half.	0.35627238654568866
Today beef stocks stand at 300 000 tonnes.	0.2223013582803601
Who will be next, quite literally, for the chop?	0.8754451606976217
I welcome Mr Amadeus' statement this morning, which acknowledged the difficulties of non-budgetisation of the EDF, which called for a more active role for the Development Council and which called for development priorities to be central to the EU' s emerging common foreign and security policy.	0.7627162101686407
I welcome too the Council declaration of 1992, its resolution of 1997 and successive changes in the Treaty of European Union.	0.8794538923178438
Action simply has not been taken.	0.5511625877335928
That is why we want annual reports, we want an annual inter-service group and we want a complaints procedure, to make sure action is actually taken.	1.0944802603765658
I ask Mr Nielson, in his summing-up, to directly address those points in the resolution.	0.8555780024575479
Mr President, I would like to restrict my contribution to the link between development cooperation and agriculture.	0.6808484289184625
Over the past couple of years, a considerable share of the funds has been channelled towards the development of agriculture and cattle breeding in the developing countries and, more especially, the Lomé countries.	0.859948632108057
The results are certainly not what we expected.	0.687291359941984
What could be the cause of this?	0.6150152788423555
I think that the cause should first and foremost be sought in the lack of clear agricultural policy in the various developing countries, barring a few exceptions.	0.7113257519615519
I think that the Commission could do a great deal there to help this develop.	1.0268087009288533
No farmer, anywhere in the world, will produce something if prices are too low.	0.6370261423616003
The governments in the developing countries are always faced with a difficult dilemma: whom should they support, the farmers or the people in the large cities who want cheap food?	0.7220684708153494
This fine balance must be struck in conjunction with the Commission, and not by the Commission on its own. In most countries where the Commission is active, development aid is also granted by the Member States themselves.	1.169743856933671
It should not be the case that the policy of the Member States contravenes that of the Commission.	0.9922162383465037
It is up to the Commission' s delegations in the developing countries to assume a leading role in the development of this political dialogue and to ensure that all countries follow this line of approach.	0.8016332313698517
Special attention is also required for the costs of the means of production.	0.830589124655016
Far too often, artificial fertiliser, veterinary medication and a host of other items are provided to farmers free of charge.	0.4039852481795962
Once the project comes to an end after five years, the policy of free gifts also ends.	0.750490829735861
I think, therefore, that the cost element should be built in right from the outset in the policy of all projects, and as far as I know, this is not the case by any stretch of the imagination.	0.9900167577864604
Finally, I wonder whether the funds could not be put to better use.	0.9790454083845948
Every year, I notice in the budget of the Commission and in the European Development Fund, that they are far behind in spending the funds.	1.1636130605914883
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we are in actual fact holding a debate amongst the converted, which is a pity.	0.8648749886994574
We should really talk about coherence in the development policy in the presence of Mr Prodi, for example, who has missed a great chance right from the outset, for he has allowed the development cooperation policy to fragment over three Commissioners - and this is better than four, I have to admit - but this does not really make for a coherent policy.	0.9871255617108979
We also note that, as before, there are still various DGs which stifle this policy with often very conflicting procedures and arguments.	0.7922882237507923
The President-in-Office of the Council came up with a good suggestion, namely to budget the European Development Fund.	0.7185705499834784
Parliament would, of course, welcome this with open arms. If this were possible, it would be a huge, historic victory.	0.8633979971417319
Since Amsterdam, three terms have taken centre stage: complementarity, coordination and cohesion.	0.5353920962570331
I believe that very little has been achieved in these three fields.	0.6944835199358539
If a request is made for a report on the progress made on cohesion, if a request is made at all, then drafting such a report cannot be very difficult, unless one simply admits that there is no cohesion at all.	0.8786490906245916
I would prefer it if a report were to be written on the present lack of cohesion, and if a systematic strategy were to be developed to reach a certain level of cohesion, for it is a long way off yet.	0.9643616216751876
One thing shocked me in the speech of the President-in-Office of the Council.	0.45417964060634525
He stated: "Contradictions in policy can lead to balance."	0.48008808901428457
It is indeed the case that what one hand gives can be taken away by the other hand, and vice versa.	0.796648531192334
But this leads to status-quo and self-deceit, and globalisation as a whole has so far only led to changes, indeed, but changes which have only made poverty worse.	0.7479300338654312
This is supposed to be our priority, would you believe.	0.7565752612579749
I know that we do a great deal of good, but let us start with this very essential aspect.	0.9724990946956457
Mr President, we have already noted that there is no report from the Commission, but I intend to discuss three matters in the light of the objectives which the Council presented in its 1997 opinion.	1.0797365592084043
The first is concerned with conflict resolution.	0.759222700768582
For many years, I have tried, through the Council and the Commission, to find out why none of the institutions is actively participating in, and working for, conflict resolution in the Western Sahara, which is occupied by Morocco.	1.050147826259535
The UN has a peace plan.	0.43760269664946055
We ought to seize this opportunity and bring the last colonial episode in Africa to an end.	0.5024603971659182
I also want to take up the subject of migration.	0.7447431355435427
I am anxious about the new stipulations in the partnership agreement with the ACP countries, which might make it easier to expel immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees on flimsier grounds.	0.7743261655226232
I really also want to see the EU pioneer patents on living organisms.	0.6101700425077178
We now know that at least one person in the world dies of hunger every four seconds.	0.7276051269753381
Three quarters of those who die are children under five years of age.	0.4940693245071929
This is not because of a lack of food, but because of what we have talked a lot about today, namely increasing poverty.	1.058020884340608
Food safety and the guarantee of biological diversity must take precedence over commercial interests.	0.5221758994764513
I believe that patents on living organisms are designed only to control the global food supply, specifically for commercial purposes and for no other reason.	0.5755578456884596
I also want to see something about women in the report I hope the Commission will produce.	1.045900422162906
Women appear to be completely absent from all areas, especially development policy when, of course, we are not in reality absent at all.	0.817565415814112
Mr President, the debate we are holding today strongly underlines the need to discuss development policy in much broader terms than are involved in simply measuring the flow of aid.	0.6709863580125651
The level of aid is naturally important, and the level of aid contributed by the rich countries as a whole ought to be increased.	0.9979247354174027
This ought to be done with, in particular, a view to combating poverty and through investing in the development of capacity.	0.8951828556421652
However, the level of aid is only one of many instruments which significantly influence the development of poor countries.	0.806049373106901
A number of colleagues have today pointed to areas in addition to aid which are important and where contrasts and conflicts between different policy areas are very serious indeed.	0.5683377306965117
The latter include trade, agricultural and fisheries policies.	0.4397457335333083
Other important areas are, of course, the flow of private investments, cooperation on research and technology and the way in which the welfare state deals with, and finances solutions to, a variety of global problems which affect us all.	0.7875053828548171
These problems include questions of climate, health issues, biodiversity etc, and the problems are clearly exacerbated by globalisation, that is to say the new economy which is developing.	0.8900366244109232
In this economy, the connection between different policy areas is that much more marked.	0.7137402911383512
In my opinion, what we are discussing here today is partly the EU' s contribution to the debate about the opportunities and risks of globalisation and about the rules there must be in order to give poor countries a decent chance.	0.900560064397172
The report, or survey, which Mrs Maij-Weggen has demanded, showing how the various policy areas fit together and what the aforementioned conflicts appear to be, is naturally quite crucial.	0.7586633371910451
I cannot help but wonder why the Commission has not done more.	0.8100400078688504
The Commission is new and has to be given time, but the absence of such a survey suggests that there are powerful tensions within the Commission.	1.0286801530095433
I can only hope that Mr Nielsen will be successful in the forthcoming discussions within the Commission.	0.7519098959577407
In addition to a report of this kind, I should like to see a more positive analysis which could be ongoing in character.	0.9037129589722241
An analysis of this kind should look not only at the flow of aid but also give comprehensive consideration to all the different types of aid and transfers of resources which influence poor countries. These include technology, trade, cooperation in the field of research etc.	0.8292756325142107
It should be an extremely constructive contribution to the debate we are conducting.	1.0516784862502033
Finally, Parliament recommends, in paragraph 6 of the draft resolution, that a working party should be established in order to bring about coherence.	1.1558725802355003
I believe it is only a coincidence, but the Commissioner for the Environment is also, of course, to participate in this group.	1.1587261177632602
Let us hope that the debate in which we are now engaged will prove to have been a watershed.	1.3275463342916507
Policy so far has been characterised far too much by a process of giving with the one hand and taking away with the other.	0.7059919927779519
There are a lot of people who will be watching further developments with great interest.	0.736150115464601
Mr President, the Seattle demonstrators argued that free trade is bad for the less- and least-developed countries, it is purely a rich country selfish interest.	0.7149042751503
Yet we might consider the rate of economic progress and the rate of eliminating poverty in countries such as India and Tanzania over the 40 or 50 years since they became independent.	0.4864615022090243
There the theory went that protectionism and state intervention would preserve jobs, allow industry to adjust gradually and without pain.	0.48496183410970345
It did not work; poverty became worse than ever.	0.5019252829415676
The medicine may not taste too good in the short term, but opening one' s economy to competition at home and abroad forces optimal application of resources and leads to a higher standard and quality of life in the not so longer term.	0.6854659078275626
Is that not the lesson of the European Union itself and of the single market in particular?	0.9145961731599037
As Mr Nielson said, this is a fine example to those countries and regions aspiring to greater prosperity.	0.8911886553288051
Yet preaching the benefits of free trade to the developing countries is not enough.	0.6210424853805253
We also have to practise what we preach in our own accessibility for imports from these countries. Parliament' s resolution on the WTO negotiations advocated a free import policy by the EU.	0.7310749504858023
Eliminating all remaining barriers to imports, tariff barriers and quotas and, just as important, non-tariff barriers, such as Mrs Maij-Weggen mentioned in her speech - eliminating these barriers would do more than any amount of development aid to secure for developing countries the economic progress which both we and they desire.	0.6207718612906756
It is quite clear that a lack of coherence of development policy with trade policy diminishes our development efforts and must also diminish the political regard of the developing countries for Europe and our fine words.	0.6366809148792891
Mr President, in the last couple of days we have heard fine words about the need for greater coherence, coordination and effectiveness in the external aid programmes of the Community and of the Member States.	1.0454907234407576
There is one relatively small area of activity with enormous public visibility which would be a litmus test of the Union' s ability to match words with action.	0.6352218804862454
I am referring to the continuing tragedy of anti-personnel landmines which present an obstacle to so many development programmes, to post-conflict reconstruction, and which ruin the lives of many of the most vulnerable in some of the poorest parts of the world, particularly in developing countries.	0.8973568660705681
Over recent years the Community has spent some EUR 200 million in mine clearance, assistance to victims and related activities.	0.5249237690295727
The Member States have spent similar amounts.	0.7203995196474364
But there is still enormous inefficiency and a lack of will to implement a strategy agreed with other members of the international community to overcome the anti-personnel landmine problem within a finite time span.	0.7611060862739785
Mr Nielson identified the problems of lack of concerted action and the need for better complementarity with Member States.	0.6884749633955356
This has been talked about for years.	0.5021134959743132
The Commission needs to carry out internal organisational changes, strengthen the coherence and effectiveness of its actions, ideally with a properly resourced central mine action policy cell.	0.4896911194160354
It would also need more rapid contractual and implementation procedures and an enhanced multiannual budget line and much improved management of its programmes.	0.5806506940247576
A proper stock-taking of the effectiveness of mine action programmes needs to take place in each of the countries seriously afflicted by landmines.	0.6729330054478362
It seems to me that the landmine issue encapsulates so many of the organisational, procedural, financial management and operational difficulties which have afflicted the Commission and the Union.	0.7811336587596195
Are these afflictions of the past, or will we find that in this relatively compact and limited area the European Union is still unable to meet its aspirations?	0.8701148300874026
Mr President, Commissioner Nielson, the conclusion of the new ACP-EU Convention is an important step towards greater coherence.	1.0940957449810251
And it is to be welcomed that criteria such as human rights, democracy, rule of law, and good governance are more firmly anchored in this new treaty than they were previously, and that earlier colonial relations no longer shape most of our relations to quite the same extent, rather, we now set greater store by these political criteria in this respect.	0.8465502438238423
For these are prerequisite to any development.	0.4009165390651016
If these criteria are not adhered to, then development does not stand a chance	0.5869531988629788
The same goes for Cuba, Mr Modrow.	0.6511447154925367
I welcome the fact that Cuba is getting closer to joining this process. But for this to happen, there are also going to have to be a few changes in Cuba.	1.0578417377659988
After all, we are all familiar with the reports from Amnesty International.	0.7657707028257391
It may well be that you, having belonged to one of the last Communist dictatorships, view the situation somewhat differently to the majority of people in this Chamber, and that you have problems where good governance is concerned.	0.880042731715206
Nonetheless, these are important criteria for the European Union.	0.8844121647406191
There is a second issue I would like to raise.	0.7406513593426152
We are discussing coherence here.	0.6783679862519177
Many speakers have cited examples of the extent to which the various policies are not coherent.	0.6847527980500769
In my view, however, the development policy itself needs to be more coherent too.	0.9282022740924766
There is no coherence because there is still no effective coordination with the Member States and there are some projects being carried out by the Member States and the European Union in the developing countries which are very much at odds with one another.	1.0307760705143447
Nor is there coherence vis-à-vis the European taxpayer when we draft a development policy which is accommodated in the Union' s budget but the EDF remains outside it.	0.5766752864122222
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if in future you succeed in making this EUR 13.5 billion subject to the supervision of the parliamentary Committee on Budgetary Control, and to bodies such as OLAF, then I believe you will raise the level of acceptability.	0.7519869679565018
This, to my mind, is also something that we should call upon the Intergovernmental Conference to do, i.e. establish the EDF firmly in the budget of the European Union.	0.9034660990750167
Mr President, we certainly must concede that, on balance, this text is full of good intentions, but we did not vote in favour of it in committee, nor shall we do so in plenary. We had two reasons for this, both of which gave rise to amendments which I should like to explain here very briefly.	1.0757713178997528
First, the Committee on Development and Cooperation advocates the communitisation of the EDF; clearly that is misguided.	0.8311022386567082
In our view, cooperation is, and should remain, an intergovernmental exercise.	1.0151341650614056
With Europe preparing to enlarge, communitising the EDF would make it easy to hide a lack of commitment behind the screen of the Community budget, quite apart from the fact that we would be wasting a fruitful and promising opportunity of associating our southern partners with our cooperation policy.	0.6453658225597318
Lastly, the Commission has, in the recent past, had trouble managing the funds for development and humanitarian aid transparently, as Mrs Maes has just reminded us so opportunely.	1.010303115470395
Why should we add to them?	0.5058948584920017
Secondly, we find it most regrettable that Mr Corrie' s report should mention the trade and development agreement with South Africa because, in the final analysis, this report is typical of the amateur diplomacy to which the European Commission is taking ever more frequent recourse.	0.94449277948025
It is perfectly astounding that the Union could have negotiated an agreement on behalf of the Member States in which a fundamental section is quite simply left blank.	0.8406325153555004
And let me say in passing, it is even more astonishing that the Council allowed it to.	0.7685355413055974
As a result, we are now in the absurd position of negotiating from a position of weakness on vital aspects such as wine and agricultural production within the framework of an agreement which we have already signed.	0.9012626331128196
The part of this agreement which blocks negotiations could mean that the Union ends up paying producers to stop producing sherry, port and a whole host of products which are purely and simply copies under international commercial law. Imagine the potential cost of such a precedent.	0.6485828560208814
It is proof, as if we still needed it, of the fact that immature diplomacy, which defends no interests, unless of course they are individual interests, and is caught between the dogma of free trade and pressure groups and more or less friendly NGOs, is not just inefficient, it is positively dangerous.	0.9308409336361194
Finally, a word on the general thinking behind the Corrie report.	0.8128376910246944
Nowadays, let us face it, the Joint Assembly is seen as an obstacle to free international trade by the dogmatisers in Geneva and Washington.	0.7244090251482629
It was a chance to reiterate that our original and exemplary mode of cooperation with the southern countries should be developed and strengthened.	0.7367824505839796
The Corrie report missed this chance and we must, regrettably, punish it for losing so much.	0.4417803152787134
. (PT) Mr President, by way of both a conclusion and a summary, I would like to highlight three key aspects of this debate.	0.7659108535426936
First of all, many speakers stressed that globalisation accentuates regional imbalances and social inequality, and increases poverty.	0.6686765770106032
This suggests that something must be done, failing which tensions will be aggravated and conflicts jeopardising international peace and stability will arise or worsen.	0.5184292319964762
Secondly, it will be important to approach development policies from a different angle in this context, taking advantage of their capacity for correcting imbalances and reducing inequality.	0.7604541344086441
I believe that the importance that everyone has attached to the European Union' s role in international development policies is significant.	0.7791812237600281
Everyone recognises, indeed this was the theme of today' s debate, that, if the European Union is to play a more active and leading role in development policies at world level, it will have no choice but to enhance the coherence of its own various development-related policies. I note that some speakers also emphasised that responsibility for coherence in EU policies is not a matter for the Council, for the Commission or for Parliament alone.	1.1007029209536694
Quite the contrary - it will have to be the subject of a concerted effort in terms of discussion and legislative and institutional preparation, be it on the part of the Commission or of the Council, or even on the part of the European Parliament itself, and some Members have in fact already suggested that a monitoring centre or a working party could be established to monitor the impact of various policies in the specific area of development.	1.0014936309820803
Finally, I would like to emphasise that it is also important - and this is one of the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency' s programme - to note the view that it is necessary to recognise the value of development in the European Union' s policies, and in particular in the context of its foreign policy.	1.046227268810093
We believe that this is absolutely vital, failing which we will be unable to take any consistent action as regards the coherence of policies, and we cannot do this without giving development policies their rightful place as an instrument for upholding the principles and values underpinning Europe' s status in the international system.	0.9033914966223027
For this reason it may be necessary, as I have stressed, to change the model and move away from the post-colonial model towards a more European approach to development policies.	0.9238437285751367
In this respect I believe - and some speakers here have also commented on this - that the adoption of the new convention, which succeeds the Lomé Convention, is an important instrument of renewal, and represents a new approach to a partnership with such an important group of countries from the south at a time of considerable instability in the international negotiating process, as demonstrated by the first negotiating round in Seattle.	0.9937084040906528
. I sense some degree of frustration in many of the contributions to this debate.	0.846001162804394
I have given you a statement on behalf of the Commission which I think provides a useful background to this discussion.	0.8950312464879957
We will furnish more detailed material relating directly to all the issues concerning coherence.	0.528662270406967
This discussion is not new.	0.26959739950971384
We are currently working on it in the Commission and when that work is done I will report on it, as many have been asking if it will be possible to see the report on coherence.	1.1694360372933936
I have no doubt that as a result of the increasing political attention attached to these problems - something which has clearly been reflected in the debate today - it will be easier for the Commission and the DG on Development to bring coherence to the forefront of our working agenda.	0.9546758116806311
This also calls for the introduction of further new mechanisms in the Commission system which may very well include, as suggested by some of the political groups in Parliament, the setting up of a special intra-service working group and the establishment of a kind of coherence watch in the Commission.	0.8576714496740122
I have read - and heard in the debate - that coherence is being used as some kind of a miracle formula that takes care of everything.	0.8366829726128937
I think it is important to keep it as a relatively clearly defined discipline of trying to reduce inconsistencies where they really exist, and we certainly do have them.	0.8194398511062837
Much of this has to do with real disagreement between sector interests in each and every Member State, as has been very honestly said here in this House: people more or less identify with their spheres of interest, and all this is legitimate.	0.9137873735984716
I would, however, warn against the illusion that incoherence is the product of some kind of a mechanical deficiency in the system.	0.5165330821195435
This exists, but it is only a small part of what we are discussing.	1.0131199101650648
The major part of it has to do with well known established differences of interest between sexes and so on, and this is the problem.	0.9134305318194688
Mr Mulder mentioned that no farmer will start producing anything if the price is too low.	0.4978583647648894
This is true in our part of the world, but our partners and beneficiaries in Africa have a slightly different perspective.	0.815200328471803
They farm, not just for a living, but in order to live, and this makes a difference.	1.1868716561303183
Subsistence farming is not based on price calculations, it is based on the hope of rain in the next season.	0.6756343925243045
This does not apply to all farming in developing countries but to the poverty-focusing which we need to deliver better than so far.	0.6603002646304699
From that perspective, what I am saying here is of deep relevance.	0.8289880640291692
Other issues have been mentioned: cattle-farming in Namibia, tomatoes and milk powder in the Caribbean.	0.4761564033171938
We should not be too masochistic.	0.7555332069018253
There is a limit to how useful that is.	0.5218489048387565
All these cases are characterised by the fact that they have been taken care of.	0.81327187534709
The intervention prices have been regulated, and the problems we had with beef in Western Africa and in Namibia were actually solved by reducing the intervention support.	0.7104429161519722
These are real problems, but they have all been dealt with.	0.9010309043748287
As regards the issue of cacao, chocolate: I repeat that the 5% has to do with creating a basis for a living in the neighbouring countries.	0.8789268480885779
What we are talking about here are the local nuts which are as important to the people collecting them and making a living out of them in Burkina Faso as coconuts for farmers in Ghana.	0.7079581641813805
This is not a clear case of incoherence, it is more a case of a competition between suppliers.	0.952870914044798
What was mentioned concerning sugar in the Caribbean is more complicated.	0.5136531594838493
In the Overseas Countries and Territories Framework the accumulation of some of these trade aspects represents a complicated problem, but it may be that what we are talking about here has more to do with promoting the interests of some European companies than with generating income in the Caribbean. In any case, this is a matter which we are currently dealing with.	0.9166822318201155
I am committed to try to create a balance in all these issues and I would mention the achievement of the trade development and cooperation agreement with South Africa.	0.9612368621604462
In all modesty, I would claim that this is something that documents that the Commission is willing to walk or fly the extra mile in order to ensure coherence between the perspective of development cooperation and the perspective of trade interests.	0.8873472792772787
We certainly have done our share to solve that problem, and I sincerely hope that we now will have a soft landing and a peaceful implementation in the forthcoming years of that agreement.	0.819854122484872
Finally, I thank you again for this debate.	1.0338999835226794
We will come back again with material on these issues, because these problems, in one way or another, are here to stay, simply because development cooperation represents basically doing something in the world that is different from taking care of traditionally-defined trade interests, etc. We have to reconcile those different approaches.	0.8967302458229218
Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson.	0.7148138861628235
I have received eight motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.	0.6460634463935105
The debate is closed.	0.04146649521247962
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.	0.25242215024922016
Next session of UN Human Rights Commission	0.20318357752457844
The next item is the statement by the Council on EU priorities for the next session of the UN Human Rights Commission on 20 March 2000.	0.8348739878094585
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the European Union played an active role in the 55th session of the Human Rights Commission held in Geneva in March and April 1999.	0.7532054805765738
It tabled resolutions on the human rights situation in Iran, Iraq, in the Israeli settlements, in Burma/Myanmar, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Sudan, and negotiated statements to be issued on behalf of the chairman on Colombia and on East Timor.	0.7396489779009304
For the first time, the European Union tabled a resolution on the death penalty, which was enormously successful, and led work on a resolution concerning children' s rights, which was a joint initiative with the Latin American group of countries.	0.965937660660849
The Union will continue to play this role at the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission to be held in Geneva in March and April.	0.7591499097179047
In particular, as agreed at the Human Rights Council Group on 9 February 2000, the European Union intends to table draft resolutions on the Israeli settlements, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burma/Myanmar, a draft chairman' s statement on Colombia, and, possibly, on East Timor, together with a draft statement on the situation in various countries.	0.8244303123737144
The European Union will continue discussions on preparations for the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission at the next meeting of the Human Rights Group in March.	0.7774740959124768
In particular, there will be a discussion of the possibility of tabling a draft resolution on the death penalty.	0.7818597803445844
To date, the group has not reached agreement on the strategy to be adopted in this respect, and in particular with regard to formulating a compromise to be tabled in the last resort in case of any amendments to the contrary, including Article 2(7) of the Charter of the United Nations, which refers to sovereignty.	1.0137774886099198
We have tried to reach agreement in advance on a compromise text, in view of the difficulties that arose at the 1999 session of the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, at which the Member States failed to agree on an amendment introducing a reference to Article 2(7) into the draft resolution sponsored by the European Union on the death penalty.	0.8937080538024467
As you know, at the 55th session of the Human Rights Commission held last year, the United States decided, at a very late stage, to table a draft resolution on China.	0.9667909595038469
This draft resolution was defeated by a Chinese no-action motion.	0.37530974904286674
The European Union voted against that motion.	0.6000688207231291
The European Union' s position on the approach to be adopted towards China in the Human Rights Commission was confirmed at the General Affairs Council on 21 March 1999: there was no European Union initiative on China nor was agreement reached to co-sponsor a resolution on China, but an EU vote against the no-action motion.	0.7874952593837373
It is by no means certain that the European Union could have maintained a united front if this resolution had been put to the vote.	0.7693711023607384
The United States of America will be tabling a draft resolution on China at the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission and are putting pressure on the European Union to support this draft resolution.	0.8650931779772532
This initiative has provoked a strong reaction on China' s part: the Chinese authorities are making representations to the countries and institutions of the European Union, in an attempt to persuade them not to support the United States' initiative.	0.830882889135993
This initiative is being discussed within the Union, but with no hope of a decision in the near future.	0.9352151988204992
It is in the interests of the European Union to keep all its options open for as long as possible, and in any case at least until after the EU-China human rights dialogue meeting is held on 25 February 2000.	0.9074563041077904
In view of changes made to the membership of the Human Rights Commission, we estimate the vote on the no-action motion will be close.	0.8150779811904141
It is therefore important this year, too, that the countries of the European Union should reach a consensus on the position to take in any vote on the resolution.	1.0162991402739439
In this context it is important to note that the European Union regularly opposes requests by China that the human rights dialogue should automatically rule out tabling a resolution at the Human Rights Commission in Geneva.	0.8219428265759359
The European Union unequivocally considers that although it is a very valuable instrument for exchanging views and for taking note of the overall position of the other party, the dialogue should also yield concrete results on the ground, and when this does not happen it may be necessary to present a resolution to the Human Rights Commission, potentially whilst the dialogue is continuing.	0.9808981405469364
The European Union also regularly informs China that the Human Rights Commission is the appropriate body for considering human rights issues, and whether or not it agrees with this initiative, this is in any case legitimate from this point of view.	0.9221540758260022
The next human rights dialogue will take place on 25 February in Lisbon, and will include seminars on legal issues and on women' s rights, and it is expected that representatives from the academic world and from civil society will take part.	0.7923805427405973
The next human rights seminar will be organised by the Portuguese Presidency in May 2000, and, during the last round of the dialogue in October 1999, the Chinese side accepted the European Union' s proposal for technical assistance to support the process of ratifying the United Nations International Pact on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the United Nations' International Pact on Civil and Political Rights, both of which have been signed by the Chinese Government.	0.912698242492084
The European Union is discussing issues on which it hopes that China will take concrete measures, and on the basis of these discussions the presidency will convey to the Chinese authorities the message that the European Union hopes China will announce positive measures at the session on 25 February.	0.8121790239046622
The presidency will also present to the Chinese authorities a list of individual cases on which it intends to express its serious concern.	0.7471341665246879
The meeting held in Beijing in October 1999 confirmed that, on the one hand, the Chinese authorities were willing to make concessions on issues relating to the dialogue itself, with a restructuring of the dialogue and of discussion of legal forms of repression such as the death penalty and administrative detention. On the other hand, they will not give any ground on the pivotal questions of the single party system and territorial integrity.	0.8069818079758846
Discussions within the European Union about the situation in China following the outcome of the dialogue rounds in 1999 have led the European Union to decide to express its concern about human rights violations in China more firmly; the same applies to the absence of concrete outcomes from the dialogue, while recognising the positive steps that China has made on the international stage.	0.8214932091090281
On various occasions the European Union has reiterated to the Chinese authorities its disappointment with the results of the dialogue, and has stressed that it hoped for better outcomes in certain more sensitive areas.	0.8136924748223837
It was decided that the dialogue should continue, but in a more targeted and effective way, given that China has agreed with the European Union' s proposal to restructure the dialogue by means of better use of experts and to establish a closer link with the seminars.	0.9176017351617077
Lastly, during the next Human Rights Commission there will also be a debate on rationalising the work of the Commission itself.	1.0101806374839035
A working party has been set up with the express task of revising the Commission' s mechanisms. This working party has worked hard to reach agreement that it is essential to enhance the effectiveness of the present mechanisms and to make them more rigorous, especially in the financial field.	0.9612375870377353
The European Union will oppose any spurious attempt to use this reform of the Human Rights Commission' s activities to limit its capacity for intervention by restricting its sphere of influence and its ongoing monitoring of all human rights issues at world level.	0.7168082071576513
. Mr President, I would like to thank the presidency for the work it has done to prepare for Geneva on subjects like racism, civil and political rights and the right to development.	0.8459197877142329
As the presidency said, much remains to be done, despite the understandable request by Parliament and many NGOs that the European Union should set out its position well in advance of the Geneva session.	0.8212111074838873
That is easier said than done - we are still discussing some of the toughest issues.	0.7760971068382269
For example, discussion is taking place about many of the matters raised in Parliament' s resolution and it is too early to predict the outcome in all cases.	0.7589924695722561
It is not surprising that the debate is long and difficult.	1.0674202988805679
That does not suggest any lack of commitment to the improvement of human rights but it does indicate the usual concern to get our approach right so that we really make a difference.	0.716552773329556
However, let me reflect that concern by referring to three controversial issues: the death penalty, Cuba and China.	0.6278435415540101
I am going to be so unwise as to allow one or two personal reflections to creep into my remarks.	0.577944570656106
We are currently reviewing the options and possibilities for introducing a death penalty resolution in the Human Rights Commission.	0.6598148259865335
This has always been a subject about which I personally have felt extremely strongly, I have always voted against the death penalty.	0.872560530089718
Spurred on by Amnesty International and others, one of the first decisions I took as Governor of Hong Kong was to abolish the death penalty.	0.5384756856375402
We know what happened recently at the UN General Assembly.	0.5896077397579198
We had to freeze our resolution on the death penalty or risk the passing of a resolution that would have incorporated wholly unacceptable arguments that asserted that human rights are not universally applicable and valid.	0.5888329014021143
The New York stage is different from Geneva.	0.40610924224858624
Last year' s debate in New York on sovereignty and humanitarian intervention was such a sensitive topic that it influenced all other issues.	0.5739625872446312
It certainly influenced the debate on the moratorium on the death penalty.	0.39634250402988536
The debate in Geneva, however, is more focused on human rights issues.	0.8226296742501487
We may therefore stand a better chance of making progress there.	0.3979462015507103
Secondly, Cuba.	0.5852640652006889
I want to address this issue directly because we in Europe are criticised unfairly for not taking human rights there sufficiently seriously.	0.6460322290899622
We are extremely concerned about moves by the Cuban Government over the last year that have further curtailed public freedom, moves like changes in the penal code and the scope of the death penalty.	0.6323864705787969
We are also worried by the recent increase in the number of political detentions.	0.6434234893597285
