Very few of them are X-linked and matrilinear.	0.9241610788596809
Autosomal recessive inheritance is difficult to be assessed in an evidence-based setting.	0.9892831331447921
By linkage analysis, several loci, but no disease gene, have been identified.	1.246866478465236
At present, few cases of familial dilated cardiomyopathy can benefit of a molecular diagnosis.	0.8652633445943525
As the results of the structural reform policy regulating the health care sector, the paper presents the possible path of increasing intrasectoral risk selection and intersectoral risk externalization (especially between the law of health care insurance, the law of statutory nursing inusrance, and the German poverty law).	1.2411740751806968
Particularly the new developments in the hospital sector will be analzyed regarding the dynamics of risk selection and risk externalization.	1.0275646719941196
The new economic ways of financing the hospital sector are inducing the need of systematic integration of the different branches of social law, especially more developed networks of the health care, the nursing system, and the social care services.	1.2924383139051985
Purpose: The inactive form of pyruvatekinase could be established in different tumours.	1.0149032779513627
Purpose of this study was to demonstate the presence or absence of the inactive form of pyruvatekinase in renal cell carcinoma, metastases and benign renal tissue by immunohistology.	0.9584981629763559
Introduction: The hemodynamic parameters of 95 patients undergoing maxillary or bimaxillary orthognathic surgery in 1996 and 1997 at the Department of OMF Surgery/Plastic Surgery, Krefeld, Germany, were analyzed retrospectivly to study the effect of intraoperative blood loss.	1.0090484130439468
Materials and methods: The parameters included the blood loss volume, age, weight and sex of the patients, the mode of osteotomy and the operation time, the surgeon, the average blood pressure, the infusion volume, the anesthesiologist, the thrombocyte counts and their function, the activity of the coagulation factors II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII and von-Willebrand-factor, and the pathological coagulation factor counts of each patient, the rate of autologous blood donation and the rate of retransfusion.	1.1985956201556005
Statistical analysis was done using the Speraman-Rho-test.	0.855330981120601
Results: The average blood loss during maxillary osteotomy was 670  +/-  380 ml and during bimaxillary surgery 1120  +/-  510 ml.	1.0741222774683548
Men lost about 300 ml more than women.	0.66076330581213
Operations of more than 3.5 h in length led to a blood loss of 1200  +/-  520 ml as opposed to 670  +/-  310 ml.	1.0737047822373185
The average blood loss among various surgeons was between 670 ml and 1180 ml of various anesthesiologists between 730 ml and 1200 ml, without statistical evidence.	0.9436156488547195
Some 17.9% of patients showed pathological thrombocytic function concerning medication with aspirin; 34.7% had pathological activities of coagulation factors, but only 2.1% with clinical significance.	1.4079625938296927
Conclusion: Mode of operation, maxillary or bimaxillary, und length of operation were the most significant factors of intraoperative blood loss.	1.1629825996121177
Patients with pathological coagulation had nearly the same rate of blood loss as patients with physiological coagulation.	0.8907391292722168
In most cases this was determined by restriction of aspirin.	0.9158019068373278
Analysis of the rate of autologous blood retransfusion showed a significant correlation to blood loss in bimaxillary surgery.	1.0376847036986991
Maxillary osteotomy led to a retransfusion of only 14.2% of autologous blood unit.	1.1082824717441069
This should be reviewed critically especially concerning costs.	0.8840225114081048
Purpose: Course and pathophysiology of a typical syndrome after irradiation of the cauda equina were studied.	1.2087162123997852
Wells' syndrome (eosinophilic cellulitis) is a rare inflammatory skin disease of unknown etiology and pathogenesis.	1.0284919019750312
Only 18 cases in childhood have been reported.	0.8322352655017231
We report on a 5-year-old girl who showed the typical biphasic and recurrent course of the disease: initially edematous-cellulitic lesions associated with blisters, followed by morphea-like changes on the extremities.	1.127883025043678
Eosinophilia of peripheral blood was apparent, which, however, was not correlated with the severity of the current condition.	1.3639392666793606
After a recurrent course for 4 months and intermittent systemic administration of antibiotics (on the assumption of erysipelas and phlegmon) and glucocorticosteroids, the disease healed without sequelae.	1.2294855515844438
Trigger factors or systemic hematologic malignancy could not be detected.	0.688903943845819
Diskussion: Wells' syndrome is probably more common than believed and should be included in the differential diagnosis of urticarial, morphea-like and bullous eruptions in childhood.	0.8746362460318728
In 1996, several employees of the French governmental organization for Blood Collection and Transfusions (CNTS) have been condemned by ordinary courts.	0.9994680063328711
They were found guilty in the affair on HIV-infected blood transfusions.	0.8514214076190749
Over 3800 persons, mostly hemophiliacs, have been infected in France and suffer from HIV disease.	1.0084945550253694
Many of them died already.	0.8319982163386301
The public in France urgently demanded the condemnation of the persons who were politically responsible for the time delay that postponed the introduction of HIV-tests for blood donations in France.	0.9303058056036898
Such a test was available from the american company ABBOTT in the early 1985, but the french authorities preferred to wait for the HIV-Test from Pasteur-Diagnostics.	1.1545480691195238
A special court, the "Court de Justice de la République", authorized to judge on members of  the governement, has been created by the French Parliament on Nov. 23, 1993.	1.0728644324528074
Six years later, the three politicians, the former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius, the minister for  Social Affairs, Mme Georgina Dufoix, and  her undersecretary of state for health, Mr.  Edmond Hervé, have been accused of involuntary homicide.	1.1272294193574068
March, 9, 1999, after five weeks of deliberations and statements, the CJR rendered his sentence: The former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius and the Minister  G. Dufoix were discharged, but the secretary of state for health, Edmond Hervé, has been declared guilty.	1.0495204082593292
However, also Mr. Hervé could leave the court room as a free person, because the President of the Court, Mr. Christian Le Gunehec, didn't want to pronounce a judgement against him, as Mr. Hervé had to suffer from almost 15 years of public  critics and attacks before he was found guilty.	1.0976254939139483
The hemophiliacs and other AIDS-patients as well as their families protested loudly against this judgement.	0.9087476396550314
They plan to file charges against the three ministers through a common court to hold them responsible.	0.7752607057752693
Classical insight therapy, derived from Freud, and `maternal' holding therapy, derived from Balint, Winnicott and others, are two contrasting treatment techniques in psychoanalysis.	0.9389222829466733
The authors believe that each of these two techniques presupposes specific philosophical basic assumptions about the nature of human beings.	1.041186619706409
The position of Freud is that of the basically traumatic character of human experience.	0.939770359322637
The contra-position of the object relation psychologists stipulates the priority of love in human experience.	0.7350877531593274
These assumptions seem to be more latent than overt guidelines of therapeutical techniques and therefore their reconstruction and reformulation have important implications for psychoanalytical therapy.	0.9166737349681997
Univentricular hearts represent rare complex cardial malformations.	0.5776027368728178
We report a case of a 34-year old male with single ventricle, two atria, tricuspid atresia, large atrial septal defect, complete transposition and pulmonary valvar stenosis.	1.215154136330621
There were no signs of chronic pulmonary hypertension.	0.8386116269793276
Intensive clinical analysis of the cardiac malformation was first performed at the age of five years.	1.0489508129762097
Conclusion was that the patient would have no benefit from operation.	0.9714821524985527
The patient had nearly normal live conditions with a profession, family and some sportive activities like squash.	0.9904067475382764
He died of sudden cardiac death.	0.5916800936542094
The malformation was examined by sequential segmental analysis and in comparison with the embryonic development.	1.0074674861415158
Clinical picture, prognosis and therapy are reported from literature.	0.965286370575547
During the last years development of cardiac surgery achieved good results.	1.0720044974642053
Special morphologic constellations, as in our case, may be the reason that conservative therapy can be sufficient for prolonged survival with good quality of life.	1.2054712327433255
The assessment and measurement of pain is essential in the implementation and control of pain relieving strategies.	1.1129590044266413
The measurement of pain in infants and children should be based on the consideration of age, cognitive level, psychological status, intercurrent diseases and the social context in order to register the child's individual situation and to avoid misinterpretation.	1.1225746721701078
From its origin to its death the human organism is submitted to functional, material and morphological changes that are perceptible.	0.9226511215734109
These changes permit classifying an individual as young, adult, old, active or infirm.	0.9439422151770434
But this estimation is not always correct.	0.89863320617284
Some appear younger, some older than expected from their chronological age.	0.991277317053967
But what is ageing and how can it be measured?	0.6953815619038273
For this, so-called markers or biological markers of ageing are used which are measurable indicators of ageing in live organisms.	0.9429852705419408
A description of the complexity, the asynchronous course and the biological variety and variability of biological age is less successful with a single indicator than with the inclusion of several markers in a multi-factorial measuring system, in a so-called test battery.	1.1378219027818297
Various test batteries have already been applied in numerous studies that consist of biochemical scans, mental and also social parameters in different combinations.	0.9544201738717424
A more precise description of such a test battery can be seen in the following discussion of the ILSE study.	1.202060699793581
The documentation form for pathohistologic findings (version III) for tumors of the maxillofacial region is presented.	0.9904499582285604
It is part of the site-specific documentation of the German Association of Tumor Centers (ADT).	1.020320239410309
Its handling is explained by instructions which are based on the ICD-O classification and the TNM system.	0.9258809297783366
The prognostic relevance of the standardized documentation has already been proven by various histomorphologic investigations concerning oral and oropharyngeal cancer.	0.7900947621494493
By means of a multicentric observational study the German Austrian Swiss co-operative group DÖSAK will develop a new prognostic model for oral and oropharyngeal cancer.	0.8937568759395799
The development of a middle ear cholesteatoma is usually associated with chronic inflammation and displacement of the mucosa present by the invading squamous epithelium.	1.0624782393372976
To analyze the clinically different behaviors of both epithelia, we used immunohistochemical methods to study the distribution and expression of interleukin-1 (Il-1), transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-), epidermal growth factor (EGF), epidermal growth factor-receptor (EGF-R), the proliferation marker MIB 1, c-myc proto-oncogene product and activation marker 4F2.	1.1480695266135754
Results stromal that keratinocytes in a cholesteatoma exhibited a much higher activation and proliferation rate when compared to middle ear mucosa cells.	0.9242648119380151
Middle ear epithelial cells showed no immunoreactivity for TGF-alpha, EGF-R, Il-1 and c-myc in contrast to the markedly positive immunoreactivity found in cholesteatoma matrix.	1.0140711948156287
The local release of cytokines and growth factors, such as TGF-alpha, EGF and Il-1 by inflammatory cells seems to be an important factor for the hyperproliferative behavior of cholesteatoma epithelium.	1.0774088356695097
Our findings could contribute to the pathogenesis of middle ear cholesteatoma and give a possible explanation for the sustained progression of its growth leading to displacement of the middle ear mucosa.	0.9736061119233009
The role of hip sonography in neonatal hip screening is still a controversial matter.	0.9336886019467606
This paper reports the results of the Austrian ultrasound hip screening program, in which all Austrian babies undergo hip sonography twice: at the birth clinic during the 1st week of life and at an age of 12-16 weeks.	1.234639716571233
Data from all public health insurance companies since 1985 and all ICD data about children hospitalized because of CDH in Austria were collected and analyzed.	0.8798614108149951
The rate of sonographically pathological hips was 6.57 % (1994).	1.0111327557862528
The treatment rate before introduction of hip sonography was 13.16 % (1985).	1.1372708154548843
The rate of open reduction went down to 0.24 per 1000 newborns, including a high number of unscreened children born abroad and also children with teratological dislocation of the hip.	1.0652204031801615
Hip sonography screening proved to be effective in detecting true instability of the hip joint as well as dysplasia.	0.9820437402087425
The optimal time for sonographic screening does not seem to be immediately after birth when only "high risk" hips (clinical instability, positive family history, breech delivery) should undergo hip sonography, but at an age between 4 and 6 weeks when the hip has already shown its true nature.	1.1134135130174343
Since one sonographic scan appears to be sufficient for screening, a further reduction of costs could be accomplished.	1.0912656718268452
Disability owing to DDH can be avoided in a number of cases, and costs for conservative and surgical treatment as well as for later endoprostheses and early retirement can be economized.	1.1693705232419465
Transactional analysis (Berne 1958) in its original concepts was intended to help even lay people to understand personal structures and psychodynamic processes.	0.9563769742324951
This intention lead some of the following authors to superficiality and a "happy-go-lucky" perspective.	0.9099397240706345
Others, most of all European transactional analysts went back to the roots of the original contents and aims and showed that they offer great clinical relevance for the understanding and treatment of a variety of disturbances.	1.1354291881690508
This article will illustrate these aspects, using the borderline syndrome as an example.	1.0327902341955344
The structural model of egostates serves to describe the borderline structure, concepts of the frame of reference and the script as patterns for the development and maintenance of the pathology, the concepts of transactions, games, symbioses and passivity as indicators for the stable instability of the relationships, and devaluations and grandiosities as examples of defence patterns.	1.0252014850573814
Practical ideas about the therapeutic contract as a basis of various working agreements, about methods of decreasing anxiety in therapeutic processes, and about contact and attachment as a substrate for corrective experiences, a healing atmosphere and dedramatisation of the process follow.	1.046341279471464
The article ends with transactional analytic considerations of transference, counter-transference and how to deal with regression processes.	0.7233045719161209
After separation of symblepharons in ocular pemphigoid, transplantation of nasal or bucal mucosa is recommended to prevent recurrent lid fusion; however, it is not always successful.	1.0485134108643324
The disturbance of generalized cheerfulness (serene-calmness disorder) is an illness, which is often recognised very late.	1.1580076449864218
It is characterised by a uniformity of psychic experience in the face of circumstances which would otherwise give cause for depressiveness, despair, great anxiety, self-accusations or aggression directed against others.	0.9292400107685043
Early diagnosis and specific therapy may decisively improve life-quality of the patients and may also prevent detrimental individual and social long-term consequences.	1.3372793917306836
Disturbances of microcirculation in coronary artery disease can be seen in the presence of critical stenosis of epicardial coronary arteries, as a result of endothelial dysfunction in the absence of significant stenosis or during recovery of ischaemic myocardium after successful angioplasty of stenosed or occluded coronary arteries.	1.0600198437242168
Diagnostic methods are morphologic/morphometric analyses, measurement of the global coronary reserve, measurement of the regional coronary microcirculation (scintigraphy, positron emission tomography) and laboratory analysis of haemorheological alterations (plasma, erythrocytes, leucocytes).	0.9058372783702174
After successful angioplasty, normalisation of glutamate extraction rate takes three to six months.	0.779340175378925
In patients with unstable angina, changes in plasma viscosity, erythrocyte aggregation and neutrophil activation occur.	0.8161441403229661
Neutrophils are activated after successful angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction and even after elective angioplasty (when measured in the coronary sinus).	1.0775003306643653
Therapeutic improvements of disturbed microvascular flow can be obtained by increasing perfusion pressure (by revascularisation, nitrates, calcium antagnoists, physical training), by improving the fluidity of the blood and by reducing the extravascular component of coronary vascular resistance (by antihypertensive treatment).	1.1771677693167992
Intracytoplasmic injection of sperm (ICSI) extracted from testicular tissue (TESE) represents the only possibility for men with non-obstructive azoospermia to father a child.	0.9225510352087332
ICSI is also the only treatment for men with obstructive azoospermia if microsurgery is not possible or not successful.	1.0509665190281905
However, approximately only every fifth treatment cycle leads to a pregnancy.	1.139497734581187
Thus, in most cases, several treatment cycles have to be performed to achieve a pregnancy and therefore testicular biopsies have to be taken several times.	1.3326892731498354
Cryopreservation of testicular tissue offers the possibility to store testicular tissue for several treatment cycles of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and to detach surgical sperm retrieval in the man and infertility treatment in the woman (ovarian stimulation, ovum pick-up, embryo transfer).	1.0643371309764171
For the man, cryopreservation offers the advantage that only one testicular biopsy has to be performed for diagnostic reasons and for sperm retrieval.	1.080370918743081
The advantage for the women is that infertility treatment is started only if testicular histology confirms spermatids, at least in the testicular tissue.	0.9924042402153679
The cumulative pregnancy rate of IVF/ICSI/TESE-cycles can be increased by cryopreservation of supernumerary pronuclear stage oocytes and embryo transfer after thawing in successive cycles.	0.8033330715513592

A main paediatric and obstetric journal (Archiv für Kinderheilkunde, Archiv für Gynäkologie) from the turn of the century were analysed including the years 1885-1910.	0.862905269514601
Purpose: To compare electron beam CT (EBCT) und prospectively ECG gated conventional CT for the detection and quantification of coronary artery calcifications.	1.1046975837795336
In Europe, saprophytic pulmonary aspergillosis represents the only mycotic infection relevant for thoracic surgery.	0.6710121215041636
From the pathogenetic point of view, it is a colonization of preexisting lung or pleural cavities following other severe pulmonary diseases.	0.9531027255772119
The incidence amounts to 0.4% among patients in a special hospital for pulmonary diseases.	1.1801430822655306
Concerning this review, the diagnosis is based on histologic examination for all 66 patients we operated on between 1961 and 1996.	1.2117712840781805
Preoperative proof of the fungal infection remains difficult.	0.6646657019937238
The majority of patients (77%) are male.	1.1930647060818775
There is a correlation between cigarette smoking and abuse of alcohol on the one hand and the incidence of the disease on the other hand.	1.1290183202007915
A higher incidence of saprophytic pulmonary aspergillosis was found for people working in agriculture, in the building trade, and in paper mills.	1.2795072233781914
Pulmonary tuberculosis and pneumonia were present in the past history in 47% of the patients.	1.0716688942798156
Usually, the tentative diagnosis is based on chest x-ray, especially if hemoptysis is present.	1.238965468933186
Major hemoptysis is the most severe and most dangerous complication caused by aspergilloma.	1.038366398010846
Clinical presentation and chest x-ray findings are non-characteristic.	0.7632506501725983
Nowadays, the typical x-ray of pulmonary aspergilloma, almost always localized in the upper lobes, became a rare finding.	1.2911132925639042
If an aspergillus infection is suspected, serologic methods are reliable and sensitive.	0.7664073915999855
A surgical procedure is absolutely indicated in patients with major hemoptysis in their history, in case of disease progression or indeterminate mass and in order to avoid fungal dissemination.	1.147537407592761
If a saprophytic aspergillosis is suspected according to radiologic findings, clinical examination, and patient's social history, an operation is justified.	1.1494891153944935
Relative surgical indications are hepatotoxic and carcinogenic effects of the mycotoxins.	0.8728379903570711
The lobectomy, if necessary carried out as pleuro-lobectomy, is the adequate resection in most patients (68%).	1.2691018299432726
However, this operation is technically demanding and it usually requires a longer operating time as compared to lobectomies for other underlying diseases.	1.189335003600562
Peri- and postoperative complications occur in 60% of resections for pulmonary aspergilloma.	1.3264429881303406
A higher incidence of postoperative complications was found for smaller resections, like segmentectomies or wedge resections, as compared to lobectomies.	1.1751935657273451
Persistent pleural space problems connected with a prolonged stay in the hospital remains the main problem.	1.054549390387305
It requires a primary or secondary thoracoplasty in a number of patients.	0.8324304083954325
The operative mortality rate is 3%.	0.8330475211678648
A systemic antifungal therapy is not an appropriate treatment for saprophytic pulmonary aspergillosis and can even cause specific complications.	0.9933219949247853
Introduction: Postoperative delirium is a common psychic disturbance occurring acutely after various surgical procedures and typically presenting with a fluctuating course.	1.2062831135146013
These patients' recovery takes longer.	0.6246752688690986
In this study we analyze the incidence of postoperative delirium in patients undergoing vascular surgery and try to identify risk factors for its development.	1.2408619802836944
Methods: Patients undergoing elective arterial operations were included.	1.1455878764367056
Their medical history, the specific vascular diagnosis and operation performed, the medication and laboratory data were monitored.	1.163152512113542
Additionally the patients were preoperatively interviewed by a psychiatrist.	1.0160687453321176
Intraoperatively the drugs, infusions, possible transfusions, blood gases and pressures were monitored, as were the times of surgery and anesthesia.	1.1603205776388326
Postoperatively patients were seen daily by the psychiatrist and the surgeon for at least 7 days.	0.9171278529420295
Postoperative delirium was diagnosed according to DSM IV criteria, and mild, moderate and severe delirium were distinguished.	1.0162540704673368
Results: Fifty-four patients entered the study.	1.0436670084989272
Twenty-one (38.9 %) developed postoperative delirium (11 mild, 2 moderate, 8 severe).	1.2981489616264128
Patients with aortic operations developed delirium more frequently than those with non-aortic procedures(55.5 vs 22.2 %, n = 27 each).	1.0857091283823168
Some preexisting diseases (hearing disturbance) increased the probability of postoperative delirium, while age was not identified as a risk factor.	1.0954408993318872
General psychopathological and depressive disturbances increased the likelihood of postoperative delirium.	0.7578828174522716
Patients who had a severe intraoperative course developed postoperative delirium more frequently.	0.8869643799198392
This was not seen in the absolute time of surgery or anesthesia nor in the intraoperative development of blood pressure or intraarterial gases, which did not differ between patients with and without postoperative delirium.	1.0833046519356349
More reliable parameters were an increased intraoperative need for crystalloid volume, intra - or postoperatively decreased hemoglobin values (Hb < 10 g/dl) and the development of acidosis that had to be treated.	1.3771928005761238
Patients with delirium had serious complications more often (8/21 = 38.1 % vs 6/33 = 18.2 %) and needed Intensive Care treatment longer (2.7 vs 2.1 days, only aortic surgery 3.2 vs 2.4 days).	1.2939756879608266
Conclusions: Postoperative delirium after vascular surgery is frequent.	1.226351364480833
Patients undergoing aortic surgery, with specific concomittant medical disease, psychopathological disturbances and a severe intraoperative course, are at risk of developing postoperative delirium.	1.1176483677395075
This report summarizes our experiences with the subjective visual vertical (SVV) as a clinical neuro-otological tool.	1.0715298131535678
In the SVV test, patients have to orient a dim light bar in an otherwise dark surrounding earth-vertical, using a remote-control.	1.0177404200688145
Normal subjects in an upright position did not deviate more than 2 ° from true vertical.	0.8160643763874275
After vestibular neurectomy, the SVV was consistently tilted by some 12 ° toward the affected ear.	0.9827168528297762
Smaller tilts (~7 °) of the SVV occured in patients with spontaneous peripheral vestibular diseases.	1.3845124381966127
This shift in SVV disappeared within weeks to months, similar to the spontaneous nystagmus.	0.8700779469235501
After stapes surgery slight deviations of the SVV towards the unoperated ear were seen in about 20% of the patients, indicating a slight irritation of the otolith organs.	0.9751902173551873
Assessed in an upright position, the SVV thus may be regarded as reflecting tonic otolithic input differences between the two ears.	1.0100946106661075
Introduction: Vocal cord paralysis is a important complication in thyroid gland surgery.	1.0758355898303529
A prospective study was conducted ascertain the frequency of laryngeal nerve palsy not caused by surgical trauma.	1.0472547082902435
Patients and Methods: Two hundred and ten patients were investigated laryngoscopically pre- and postoperatively after short-term intubation in the course of operations far removed from thorax or neck region.	1.1018204569544787
We noted the inner diameter of the tube, intubation problems, the qualification of the anaesthesiologist and the positioning of the patient.	1.0972200923539264
Results: Preoperatively we found previously unknown unilateral laryngeal nerve palsy in 1.9 % of cases.	1.0635327673513375
Postoperatively there were pathological findings of vocal cords in 13 patients (6.2 %).	0.8773804955323127
In 10 patients a direct lesion (oedema, rubor, haematoma, granuloma) was established.	0.965490260754513
Three patients (1.4 %) were found to have a movement disorder caused by a neural lesion without morphological findings, leading to restitutio ad integrum in two of three cases after 6 months.	1.1387607952018381
Conclusion: The frequency of intubation-related recurrent nerve palsy is 1.4 % transiently and 0.5 % permanently.	1.180687723772381
Preoperative laryngoscopic investigation of vocal cords should be carried out before intubation.	0.7575456541876903
Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) are the most frequent infections cause of genital ulcerations.	1.2502704332112364
Although genital infections by HSV-1 are increasing HSV-2 is dominant in recurrent infections.	0.8626349960422682
This study was conducted on a panel of sera collected anonymously in 1996 and 1997 from blood donors (1979 samples) and hospital patients (3079 samples) without risk factors for herpesvirus infections such as STD, other infectious diseases and immunosuppression.	1.146985050247953
Serum samples were tested with ELISAs using monoclonal antibody-selected native gG1 and gG2 as antigens and an immunoblot using type-specific recombinant glycoproteins.	0.820219880991732
Equivocal results were confirmed with an in-house Western blot.	0.8787909416759908
This study investigates the effects of acamprosate, a glutamatergic modulator, and the lipid peroxidation inhibitor U-101033E on neurological outcome following incomplete cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in rats.	1.017756948248552
We report on three family members suffering from both autosomal dominant Hailey-Hailey disease and bipolar affective disorder.	0.983459799384625
As molecular biology techniques have made the localization of genes causing simple Mendelian traits possible as a routine task, the gene for Hailey-Hailey disease will presumably be localized in the foreseeable future.	1.0249112613997287
The Hailey-Hailey gene and its chromosomal surrounding will then be a region of interest for linkage studies in bipolar affective disorder.	0.8765460080894667
Background: Osteoporotic fractures occur frequently also in men.	1.1879851397858567
Epidemiologic data from Germany indicate that more than 900,000 men are affected by osteoporotic fractures.	0.8811528401293244
Diagnosis and therapy of male osteoporosis are hampered by a lack of clinical studies.	0.9150101549680291
Recurrent headaches and recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) are the most common pain syndromes in childhood: The prevalence of tension headache amounts to 20-50 %, of migraine to 5-7 % and of RAP to 15-30 %.	1.365440741784992
In nearly 50 % of children the complaints persist over many years of their life-span.	1.1798538619457295
The unfavourable long-term prognosis support the indication of early and specific interventions.	1.155560532886855
Empirical findings on the etiology, pathogenesis, and pathophysiology are still very limited.	0.9267919355538106
Actual approaches suggest to understand recurrent pain syndromes as a complex and multidimensional disturbance, and in this context there is strong evidence for the major importance of psychosocial influences.	1.263443366623853
The behavioral-medicine proceeding bases upon an extensive family anamnestic exploration and symptom analysis.	0.7407276620725857
The psychological interventions applied in clinical practice include prophylaxis (stress inoculation, cognitive redefinition, problem solving), reduction of pain symptoms (relaxation, distraction, imagination) and environmental modification (parental reinforcement and modeling behavior).	1.1014772611627301
During the last years there has been an increasing trend to create more complex and multidimensional behavioral pain management programs for children.	1.0296175822961573
The aim of our study was to develop noninvasive stereotactic radiotherapy for patients with choroidal metastases.	0.9789233387355852
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is standard therapy for urolithiasis.	0.8704643856614658
With comparable technical principles, various lithotripters have been developed and are in routine use.	1.0038112408383792
Renal pelvic stones, calyceal stones, ureteral stones, and other special forms can be treated with varying results.	1.0635836648770434
Currently, the so-called clinically insignificant residual fragments and the recurrence of calculi are under discussion.	0.9802261343144902
Whereas the side effects of ESWL are well known, studies comparing ESWL with other endourological procedures are still lacking.	0.9294950098881182
Suramin has long been used in the treatment of onchocerciasis and trypanosomiasis.	0.7662415106987619
Recent investigations showed an antiproliferative effect of suramin on prostate carcinoma cell lines.	0.897014592768554
Ongoing clinical trials have confirmed the effect of suramin on metastasizing prostate carcinoma.	0.8562665783598085
Five patients with metastatic prostate carcinoma resistant to classic hormonal therapy were treated with high-dose suramin.	1.0380441751656646
Four of the five developed a papulovesicular or maculopapular rash within 2 - 4 weeks of starting therapy.	1.0656438973015656
The rashes disappeared after discontinuation of suramin within 10 days.	0.6928080932658148
In tumour therapy, high dosages of suramin are used to achieve a serum level of 200 - 300 µg/ml.	1.1718053680965748
Therefore, a toxic reaction to suramin is suspected as the explanation for the skin rashes.	1.0652399453647514
Acetylcholinesterase (ACE) inhibitor-induced angioedema is supposed to be an uncommon cause for oropharyngeal edema.	1.0170014644608254
Between January 1, 1993 and February 1, 1997 we treated 20 patients with edema of the oropharyngeal region that was not caused by infection or irradiation.	0.9851908504386361
The most common reason was an ACE-inhibitor-induced angioedema and occurred in 9 cases, all of whom required inpatient treatment.	1.1381768962425114
The medical management consisted of the administra- tion of intravenous (i.v.)	0.8383977712098589
glucocorticosteroids in all cases, H1-blockers in 6 cases, epinephrine by inhalation in one case and i.v.	1.0336176175062537
Tracheostomy had to be performed in one patient.	1.2713067044653397
In our experience it is necessary to reconsider ACE inhibitor-induced angioedma in any case of an oropharyngeal edema.	1.060862552514616
However, there is no reason for the routine application of epinephrine in these cases.	1.3097192608307815
After treatment of more than 3000 kidney and ureteral stones with the Siemens Lithostar Multiline the results of the first 1400 ureteral stone treatments using the "Booster technique" and 3-month follow-up findings are reported.	1.1561207359989754
There was a disintegration rate of 98 % directly after treatment; 1 week after "Booster technique" treatment 96 % of the patients were free of stones and without any symptoms.	1.213314571632656
The 3-month follow-up showed a stone-free rate of 97 %.	1.0196293507021728
Only in 13 % of the cases auxiliary procedures were neccessary, 7 % of them before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and 6 % after ESWL.	1.336289964008294
43 % of the treatments were performed without any premedication, anaesthesia or sedoanalgesia.	1.1936853962779235
Our data even prove that in situ ESWL is a safe and effective method for the treatment of ureteral stones.	0.8785239931877811
In comparison to endoscopic procedures, it is superior in regard to invasivity, side effects, complications and neccessity of analgesia, while being just as efficient.	1.0677106755830634
Therefore it is recommended as first choice method in the treatment of ureteral stones.	1.0622204053622024
The perspectives for active hearing implants lie in the treatment of patients with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL).	0.7418750455134713
The majority of patients with SNHL suffer from a cochlea amplifier (CA) failure which is discernible by a positive recruitment and loss of otoacoustic emissions (OAE).	0.9616280808202098
Therefore, the electronic implant is expected to partially replace functions of the CA.	1.0502925878505749
Thus, the implant is thought to function as a CAI (cochlea amplifier implant).	1.0156687640690898
An approved implant for routine use is not yet available.	1.0348560185028124
Clinical studies have thus far only used the high energy consuming (HEC), narrow-band, electromagnetic floating-mass transducer, as well as the Maniglia-HEC implant.	1.09721699295031
The high energie consuming, yet broadband Canadian Fredrickson implant is soon to be used in humans.	1.0217525731626964
Of the piezoelectrical implants, a German CAI (Tübingen implant) at present consisting of a piezoelectrical transducer and a microphone has thus far been acutely implanted in first patient.	1.0273613735230782
It is a low energy consuming (LEC), broad-band implantable system for patients with sensorineural hearing loss.	1.0922393486363062
Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) was de-scribed electroclinically by Janz and Christian in 1957 and consists of myoclonic jerks in  varying combination with the absence of seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, a typical circadian distribution on awakening, sleep deprivation, alcohol consumption and flickering stimuli as characteristic precipitating factors, typical EEG abnormalities with generalized epileptiform discharges, normal physical and neuroradiological findings, and often a family history of epilepsy.	1.0321105352688897
Although the misdiagnosis of this well-classified and easily treatable syndrome is supposed to occur rarely in Germany, we retrospectively investigated how often the wrong initial classification had been made among patients who were finally treated in our outpatient epilepsy unit.	1.1443810650273831
Between 1993 and 1995, 30 patients with a typical JME-like symptom constellation were identified who had been misdiagnosed initially.	1.0066398055547574
In all patients, localization-related epilepsy had been classified, although regional EEG abnormalities were rare (n=5).	1.0023827025108563
All patients reported the typical circadian distribution, abnormal neuroradiological findings were absent, and typical EEG abnormalities were present in all cases.	1.0633952599713634
Under treatment with appropiate antiepileptic drugs 97% of the patients became almost completely seizure-free.	1.0244654113475844
Even 40 years after the first description of the syndrome, JME is an underdiagnosed illness.	1.1001723625407438
The generally  positive course underlines the importance of its correct identification.	0.7526398114831193
Background: The aim of the study was to evaluate results of visual acuity and binocularity and complications after cataract surgery with primary capsular bag-fixated IOL implantation in children.	1.0309670464357565
Arterial hypertension is known to be an important risk factor for cerebral and cardiovascular disease.	1.1028841371729952
Previous studies have demonstrated alterations in the perifoveal microcirculation in patients with essential hypertension.	0.9513959897844055
During follow-up a progression of these alterations has been reported.	0.9556160321911901
In the present study we quantified the retinal microcirculation of patients with hypertension under different systemic antihypertensive medication.	1.04775725181961
Vaginal and uterine bleeding is a common symptom in gynecology.	0.7990628728112587
The cause of the bleeding should be investigated so as to exclude carcinoma as its origin.	1.0065214266539095
First, the basic circulation parameters should be determined.	0.9768612609877071
Blood volume and oxygen substitution are essential.	0.798362130908135
Depending on these findings, further diagnostic or therapeutic steps must be undertaken.	0.9452125530034181
If the situation is stable, diagnostic measures are indicated to localize the bleeding and the tumor.	1.064958015175877
A general examination, including a vaginal and rectal examination, must be performed.	1.09095244892107
Other diagnostic procedures such as ultrasound (vaginal and transabdominal) and CT or MRI may be required.	1.0178042982002287
If available, an angiography should be performed.	0.7709106456189658
Medium-term results with a follow-up of at least 3 years were done in 160 patients (average follow up 51 months) after ACL reconstruction using IKDC evaluation form and Noyes score and in 110 patients (average follow Up 53 months) after non-operative management.	1.2702262028270797
Unlike objective good parameters the subjective assessment of knee function according to the Noyes score reveals significantly worse results in cases with ACL reconstruction compared to the knees without surgery.	1.0286192832858743
The best functional results we found in professional athletes after ACL reconstruction.	0.9073068964195117
Comparable positive results of knee function is only achieved in approx.	0.9469630638304386
15 % of the patients from the natural history group, who can maintain high risk pivoting activity level feeling no giving way.	1.148880858043835
In our opinion compensatory proprioceptive mechanism account for the surpassing results in these two groups of patients.	1.1364626681626557
It will be postulated that it is not the absolute power of the hamstring but the latency period of recruition that influences the compensation of anterior knee instability.	0.9963955001686237
We have modified our rehabilitation methods in order to improve proprioception and dynamic stability of the ACL-deficient knee.	1.0176032324498276
Based on our results we primarily limitate the ACL reconstruction on a group of patients practicing high-risk-pivoting sports.	1.1173712870700563
Only when menisceal lesions appear or patients suffer from giving way episodes we support secondary surgery.	0.7157282870807814
The pivot shift sign is reflecting the dynamic aspect of knee instability.	0.7386212492942968
In our opinion it is the decisive parameter to assess knee instability unless there are useful technical procederes.	1.0594706566366647
Multiple injuries in elderly patients are still a common problem.	1.116615139506615
The present study was performed to investigate mortality and complications in multiple trauma patients aged 65 years or more.	1.0981507586479644
A total of 1154 multiple trauma patients with an injury severity score (ISS) of at least 18 points were divided in two age groups: Y: 16 - 64 years, n = 1022; O: 65 - 94 years, n = 132.	1.1519940707624499
Older patients were injured as pedestrians in most cases (69%), while younger patients were more frequently injured as car and drivers passengers (41%).	1.036989502023344
ISS was comparable in both groups (Y 28 +/- 1, O 27 +/- 1).	1.1252039156555438
During ICU-therapy incidence of ARDS (Y 10%, O 11%), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MOF; Y 6%, O 9%) and pneumonia (Y 17%, O 21%) were comparable.	1.3698165498080592
In contrast, septic complications were more frequent in older patients (Y 19%, O 27%).	1.19543090599735
Length of ICU stay (Y 19 +/- 2, O 18 +/- 1) and ventilation time (Y 14 +/- 2, O 17 +/- 1) were comparable.	1.1823262473623244
Mortality was significantly higher in older patients (Y 15%, O 53%).	1.0659332821298824
The major cause of death was sepsis in older patients (Y 15%, O 31%) and MOF in younger patients (Y 54%, O 29%).	1.2076137492161276
In conclusion, older trauma patients had a higher mortality due to the development of septical complications.	1.1281969521933837
The Raynaud phenomenon occurs in 90-100% of patients with systemic scleroderma.	1.0060425283622918
It is caused by dysregulation of the vascular tone between vasocontrictive and vasodilatory influences.	0.8369946177181675
Early damage to the vascular endothelium and the activation of platelets lead to the release of vasoactive substances.	0.9017928892206425
Structural and function impairment of the perivascular neural fibers contributes to the vasospasm.	0.7544996978051729
New vasodilatory treatment strategies, e.g.	0.4831612639009135
infusions with calcitonin gene-related peptides, could be useful in the control of vasospasm in the peripheral extremities as well as internal organs in systemic scleroderma.	1.0915399127828922
Due to the limited efficacy of drug therapy in atrial fibrillation and the high rate of recurrence, strong efforts were made to find non-pharmacological strategies.	1.1094287871973703
For three years now, the implantable atrial defibrillator Metrix from InControl has been available as an alternative therapy.	1.0048501657700466
From October 1995 to the present the atrial defibrillator was implanted in 179 patients worldwide.	0.9659081837407338
The sensitivity of the system and its algorithms to detect atrial fibrillation is 90%; the specifity to detect sinus rhythm is 100%.	1.1563660783964205
In 121 of 179 patients, 748 episodes of spontaneous atrial fibrillation were treated with 2.4 shocks per episode.	1.0072021717051027
No proarrhythmic event or stroke was seen.	0.565386338615645
A cardioversion to sinus rhythm could be achieved in 95% of patients; the overall clinical success rate was 88%.	1.2168525150453293
In 7% of all patients, early recurrence of atrial fibrillation (ERAF) occurred that could not be converted into stable sinus rhythm after further cardioversions and antiarrhythmic therapy.	1.0764679263952295
In 4.1% there were lead-related complications, in 4 patients the device had to be explanted because of ineffective therapy, and in 3 patients the device had to be changed because of loss of telemetry or early depletion of battery.	1.1115772368280061
In 8 patients, postoperative complications were seen (infections, pneumothorax and thrombosis of the subclavian vein).	1.1277067093421411
Overall, the implantable atrial defibrillator Metrix is an effective and safe alternative in treating atrial fibrillation.	1.1353110178319816
Background: The success rate of combined glaucoma and small incision cataract surgery is not yet established.	1.162400419900229
The somatosensory system of preterms and newborns differs substantially from adults.	0.769590212897111
These differences are of considerable preclinical and clinical interest.	0.7626788116776841
Maturation of A- and C-fibre synaptic connections in the dorsal horn and development of descending inhibition from the brainstem all take place postnatally in the rat.	0.9731254412311903
In early stages of development there is no definite spatial sepraration in the dorsal horn between the nociceptive and the non-nociceptive system.	1.0503603979562932
In preterms but not in adults non-noxious stimuli can induce central sensitization.	0.8701454566720498
Many neurotransmitters and signalling molecules involved in pain pathways are expressed early in the developing nervous system but do not reach adult levels for a considerable period.	0.8628775548476283
More important, receptors are frequently transiently overexpressed or expressed in areas during development where they are not seen in the adult and may have a different functional profile.	0.9722087154369647
The descending pain inhibitory system that provides an important protection against central sensitization developes later than the ascending nociceptive system.	0.881552094847733
Thus, during a critical period of time the immature nociceptive system is highly vulnerable.	1.37585031030436
For example, neonatal circumcision in the absence of analgesia results in increased pain responses during subsequent routine vaccination months later.	0.8921824282328636
Numerous studies conducted during the past decades indicate that the public's attitude toward the mentally ill is strongly prejudiced.	0.9044370207571852
Since the attitude of the general public also has an effect on community-based psychiatric care, we must ask how public opinion might be influenced.	1.0278430193408454
One possible approach could be through so-called key community leaders - those who are highly respected in society because of their competence in a particular area.	1.0506405833097654
Doctors belong to this group of people.	0.8219395223045891
For this reason we questioned medical students, as future key community leaders, with respect to their attitudes toward the mentally ill within the framework of their first contact with psychiatric patients during their studies.	1.1019546590478981
In order to make a direct comparison possible, we interviewed a sample of the Mannheim population who live in a part of the city where a variety of complementary facilities have been set up.	1.0122640132522356
The comparison shows that medical students do not have a more positive attitude toward the mentally ill; in fact, in certain areas they have an even more negative attitude toward the mentally ill than the general population has.	1.0589042759846852
We were not able to establish what effect teaching has with respect to changing attitudes.	0.7097951115494088
Systematic lymphadenectomy for colorectal cancer aims to remove potentially metastatic lymph nodes from the tumor's drainage basin.	0.9508590076070067
This requires knowledge of normal lymphatic anatomy and metastatic routes.	0.8175259938369419
Systematic lymphadenectomy performed as a standard or as an extended resection is a prerequisite for pathologic tumor staging.	1.0103733833156356
An intensive search by the pathologist for lymph node metastases is critical for precise staging.	0.9004985226332847
Recommendations as to the extent of lymphadenectomy are derived from potential improvement of prognosis and procedure-related complications.	0.9023619982070243
Life threatening hemorrhage in patients with malignant tumours of the head and neck area are often, as a result of tumour infiltration, postoperative anatomical changes, infection and radiological necrosis, difficult to control.	1.1698115926669148
One option for prophylaxis and treatment is the ligature of the external (ECA) or common carotid artery (CCA) and superior thyroid artery (STA).	1.0773717594896821
52 patients were examined in a retrospective study to determine both the hazards and the therapeutic use of the procedure.	1.3456221910161321
The external carotid artery (ECA) was ligated prophylactically during the operative procedure of tumour resection and neck dissection in 25 patients.	1.0273402423612068
In 27 cases closure of the ECA, CCA or ECA and STA was carried out as an emergency procedure for acute hemorrhage following completed primary treatment (operation, primary or postoperative radiation or radiochemotherapy).	1.0522968297853235
There was no postoperative hemorrhage after prophylactic ligature of the ECA.	0.9006900181837699
One patient with multiple cardiovascular diseases suffered from an ipsilateral cerebral infarction 1 year after operation.	1.0269650630549148
In 6 of 9 patients and in all 3 patients, in whom ligature of the CCA or ECA and STA respectively was carried out as an emergency procedure, severe neurological complications up to an apallic syndrome occured.	1.1626941647754876
The number of deaths due to acute hemorrhage was considerably smaller among those patients with prophylactic ligature of the ECA performed during operative procedure of tumor resection and neck dissection.	1.0290648598823056
In addition there were much less unfavourable courses in the sequence of prophylactic closure of the ECA than observed after ligating the CCA or ECA and STA in an emergency situation.	0.9921446667875957
The carcinoid tumor of the middle ear is a very rare neoplasm which in general is regarded as benign but may be mistaken for an adenocarcinoma because of its histological heterogeneity.	0.9920810952526777
Typical, however, is its neuroendocrine and mucinous differentiation so that an unequivocal diagnosis is possible by means of immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy.	1.0720400674996877
As the tumor is very rare, there is no statistical evidence as to whether further treatment is necessary after primary exstirpation of the tumor.	1.1276256436212684
Therefore, a review of the literature was performed.	1.252360315602243
We report about a 28-year-old male patient with a carcinoid tumor of the left tympanic cavity.	0.9731056185785674
Without any further treatment there has been no evidence for either recurrence or metastases 32 months after surgical resection.	1.0849493989200503
As treatment of choice we recommend conservative surgery with complete removal of the tumor and a clinical follow-up on a regular basis.	1.2097368256536734
Intraoperative precision in computer-assisted surgery depends on the characteristics of a navigation system, the precision of correlation between object and data set, the position, number and fixation of landmarks, and the parameters of the data set.	1.2039713365729285
The characteristics of a navigation system, in particular the immanent precision, can be detected by the use of the geometric model and navigation analyzer developed at the University of Regensburg with the support of Carl Zeiss, Germany.	1.1244422214547027
The precision of five navigation systems of different types and technology was measured: Viewing Wand (ISG, mechanical system), the SMN microscope (Carl Zeiss, infrared system with laser autofocus), the MKM system (Carl Zeiss, robot platform with laser autofocus) and the STP pointer (Leibinger, infrared system).	1.072375570904052
The immanent precision of these systems ranges from 0.1 to 2.0 mm.	1.3819438653173926
An electromagnetic system (3-Space Digitizer, Polhemus) was compared; this produces serious spherical deviations of 10.0 to 20.0 mm in the presence of metal, surgical and rotating instruments, and circuits.	1.2868759427404157
The application of these different systems for craniomaxillofacial surgery is discussed.	0.7972928383731964
The aim of the study was to record retrospectively the events of Pneumocystis carinii-Pneumonia (PCP) among HIV-infected children (<18 years) in Germany.	1.2006294125560117
The patients were evaluated with regard to prophylaxis, course of disease and prognosis.	1.362033613454119
In this study we looked at the relationship between extracorporal circulation and changes in blood electrolytes.	1.0445457291420017
Glucocorticoids are a potent cause of osteoporosis and thus a potential source of substantial morbidity in patients who are already significantly disabled by their underlying condition.	1.0798812118906964
These agent interact with calcium metabolism at many levels; in particular they reduce the osteoblast's synthesis of the principal proteins of bone matrix.	1.0466751270331296
They also reduce circulating sex hormone concentrations, particularly in men and postmenopausal women.	0.9444310856492708
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), which form a rare group of neoplasias of the gastrointestinal tract, have not yet been fully investigated.	1.1320115364136532
Although good progress has been made in their diagnosis, classification of these lesions with regard to their histogenesis and biological behavior remains problematic.	1.1974863154255415
Between 1994 and 1998, 18 GIST patients underwere operation in the Department of Surgery.	0.844929108950319
Twelve of these patients (67 %) had stromal tumors in the stomach, and six (33 %) had intestinal stromal tumors.	1.2436307353039784
The primary tumor could be removed in all patients with R0 resection.	1.2423990675104775
Six patients developed hematogenous liver metastasis, with the size of their primary tumor exceeding 10 cm.	1.1025634769670851
Extrahepatic distant metastases were not found in any case.	0.8934264780168014
Lymphadenectomy showed that lymph node metastases did not occur.	0.778000622666547
Histological evaluation was made according to the guidelines of Lewin, Weinstein and Riddell.	0.8212557910435453
Currently established therapy is limited to complete surgical resection of the primary tumor and its metastases.	1.2223659868463506
Adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy approaches have failed.	0.5955919377315347
Acute leptospirosis in Europe (Weil's disease) is a rare and in more than 90 % of the cases undiagnosed febrile, self-limited disease.	1.1623526295351116
We report the case of a 39-year-old sewerage worker, who was admitted to our hospital with fever, jaundice, pain in his calves and acute renal failure.	1.0465728423991438
Serology revealed elevated antibody titers against Leptospira canicola, L. icterhaemorrhagica and L. sejroe.	0.7624741251412853
The patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with diffuse gastrointestinal bleeding due to thrombocytopenia.	0.9532132174527285
The ECG showed atrial fibrillation with irregularly irregular rhythm.	0.8638764701732077
Cardiac arrest developed, most likely due to hypoxia, with a drop in the blood pressure.	1.2162982415981334
Despite immediate resuscitation efforts the patient developed severe hypoxic brain damage and died a few days later.	1.0526149815184445
Autopsy disclosed histologic signs of a generalized leptospiral infection, signs of shock and within the lungs a necrotizing herpes simplex virus pneumonia causing the death of the patient.	0.9284608539591762
The virus pneumonia most probably was caused by retrograde canalicular dissemination of oral secretions since herpetic tracheitis and esophagitis were found and herpetic lesions were readily identified on the lips and tongue.	0.8704257328173943
A medical opinion asked for by the professional association having liability for occupational safety and insurance was given, the disease being recognized as an occupational disease.	0.9907876522566958
During the past decade, the molecular mechanisms in the process of tumor progression, including metastasis and angiogenesis, have become better understood.	1.3131139024784682
Cancer metastasis consists of multiple, complex interacting steps.	0.8141607570604926
Each of these steps is crucial and limiting, since a failure to complete any one prevents the tumor cell from producing a metastasis.	1.0496530742418955
Detachment from the solid tumor by loosening the intercellular junctions and proteolysis of the extracellular matrix enables tumor cells to enter blood- and lymph vessels.	0.9573177204082566
The intravasation into the circulation is supported by the secretion of angiogenic factors, which induce degradation of the basal membran in blood vessels.	1.0736666322330346
Adhesion to endothelial cells, extravasation from the circulation, and induction of angiogenesis are further essential steps for completing the metastatic process.	0.8791941668637132
Furthermore, it is well known that once a tumor cell has entered circulation, it will survive only by evasion of the immune system.	1.1946793901364352
The systematic identification of tumor antigens opens up new possibilities for immunotherapeutic approaches.	0.6899961329188461
Hypogonadism is the main indication for testosterone substitution in the ageing male.	0.8753292922117003
The choice of the testosterone preparation should be based on the principle that serum levels of testosterone remain in the normal range and fast termination of therapy is possible.	1.0284436074159038
To date, transdermal testosterone systems appear to be best suited for substitution therapy in the ageing male.	0.8529673521270178
Future promising developments are testosterone gels and intramuscular testosterone undecanoate.	0.6344305712246142
Any testosterone therapy in the ageing male has to be monitored closely, especially regarding erythropoiesis and the prostate.	1.1046443158322028
Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is a disease that involves the lining of joints, bursae and tendon sheaths.	0.9566619244780566
The incidence is low and estimated to be 1.8 patients per million population.	1.0448554143724669
The cause of PVNS is unclear and discussed to be either inflammatory or neoplastic.	0.8874749226380385
PVNS has been described in 2 forms different for prognosis and treatment (nodular and diffuse).	0.9970648099272941
The articular form almost appeares in the knee joint as we describe below in a 14 year-old patient.	1.0505897244941493
In this retrospective study, 13 patients with subtle Lisfranc joint injuries were examined after a mean period of 23 months using clinical assessment, radiography and dynamic pedographic gait analysis.	0.9486398147446813
The aims were to identify the factors leading to a mobile flatfoot deformity, evaluate the functional and clinical outcome of these injuries, and draw practical conclusions for initial management and subsequent intervention.	1.063356339715411
All patients showed a mobile flatfoot deformity, increased motion in the subtalar joint, increased load on the hindfoot, decreased load on the forefoot, and a prolonged contact phase during the stance phase.	1.1332467536950404
Radiographs revealed progressive osteoarthrosis in the joint and a residual displacement of the medial Lisfranc joint.	1.0125270443631351
An unstable medial Lisfranc joint results in the development of a mobile flatfoot.	0.9615925172735135
Initial treatment of a subtly displaced Lisfranc joint should consist of exact anatomical reduction and additional maintenance of the longitudinal arch of the foot.	0.9414454391687309
After failed initial treatment, early arthrodesis of the midfoot is recommended as a salvage procedure for the foot.	1.070265999560208
Cross-sectional imaging with CT and MRI plays an indispensable complementary role to endoscopy in the pretherapeutic workup and staging of laryngeal neoplasms.	0.9764558357558865
Adequate interpretation of the CT and MR images requires a thorough knowledge of the patterns of submucosal spread and familiarity with the diagnostic signs of neoplastic invasion as seen with each modality.	1.0195741330420327
In addition, the radiologist should be aware of the implications of imaging for staging and treatment.	0.9446724557407687
Both CT and MR imaging are highly sensitive for the detection of neoplastic invasion of the pre-epiglottic space, paraglottic space, subglottic region and cartilage.	0.8889835178194927
The high negative predictive value of both CT and MRI allows exclusion of neoplastic cartilage invasion quite reliably.	0.8438209697385984
The specificity of both CT and MRI is, however, limited and both methods may therefore overestimate the extent of tumor spread.	1.1686502351338204
Nevertheless, both cross-sectional imaging methods significantly improve the pretherapeutic staging accuracy of laryngeal tumors if used in addition to clinical examination and endoscopic biopsy.	1.2951862832453283
In the presence of a submucosal mass, CT and MRI play a key role for the diagnosis, as they may characterize the lesion, reliably depict its submucosal extent, and guide the endoscopist to perform deep biopsies that allow a definitive histological diagnosis.	1.0947932010034074
Background: HLA-DR antigen plays a key role in transplantation immunology.	1.2000593234491934
Organ culture storage leads to loss of HLA-DR-positive corneal Langerhans cells.	0.6547522181946189
This study investigates the importance of prolonged storage period for the success rate after penetrating keratoplasty.	1.0074511181437837
Ergotamine-containing drugs are widely used in the treatment of acute migraine attacks.	0.9859729000820114
Among others, spastic vasoconstrictions are one of the possible side effects usually affecting the lower extremities and sometimes leading to gangrene.	0.898686808326334
The case of a 75 year old woman is presented who was suffering from migraine-attacks since adolescence.	1.1552308947500056
Due to longterm use of ergotamine containing suppositories she developed perianal ulcers.	0.6877725827138629
After withdrawl of the drug the ulcers healed up entirely.	0.9559322062114884
The spectrum of ergotamine-induced side-effects and possible intervention strategies are discussed.	0.9338164715742736
In this article, a model of quality assurance for inpatient psychotherapy is discussed, which was developed in cooperation between researchers and clinicians.	1.243831879521998
This model is based on the concept of internal quality assurance with external help.	0.9316468828118774
The Heidelberg Model of Active Internal Quality Assurance has three elements: (1.)	0.9987461982231657
a QA-Inventory for routine monitoring; (2.)	1.1632191082697674
rules for evaluating the outcome of every patient and (3.)	1.2133678381186621
a feedback model for communicating the results to the therapists (quality circles).	0.8979264082547219
The focus of this model is the recognition of problematic results.	0.9937478675326386
It is mainly these results that will be discussed in our quality circles, where the outcome of treatments from the perspective of the inventory and of the therapists are discussed.	1.142119009530472
This feedback model and the quality circles will be explained with three examples of patients.	0.9944428711341732
The Heidelberg Model of Active Internal Quality Assurance will be seen as the basis of a concept of Quality Assurance, which is aimed at assuring and improving the quality and rationality of the psychotherapeutic service.	1.1089125200632588
Aims: In this study the technique of intravenous regional anesthesia (Bier block) was evaluated as an experimental tool to differentiate peripheral and central effects of analgesics.	1.2924331358322403
A pre-term infant weighing 900 g, gestational age 25 weeks, developed an acute abdomen.	0.9995926384642603
Intravenous lines had been inserted previously in the left (silasticcatheter) and right (24 G cannula) saphenous veins in the neonatal intensive care unit.	1.1471364737194698
During surgical exploration, a perforation of the terminal ileum was found.	0.9621404630520496
The operation consisted in partial resection of the perforated ileum with an end-to-end anastomosis and a double-lumen colostomy.	0.8238455353797505
Major blood loss during the procedure caused serious haemodynamic problems.	0.9019211684804361
Despite transfusion of erythrocyte (100 ml), thrombocytes (75 ml), and albumin (50 ml), the patient developed bradycardia and hypotension.	1.448993269913483
Administration of atropine, adrenaline, and calcium IV had no effect.	0.8536147538636577
The operation could be finished only with extrathoracic resuscitation.	0.7031945732345336
When the drapes were removed, livid, swollen lower limbs raised the suspicion of an acute thrombosis of the inferior vena cava.	0.9160592224045208
After insertion of a 24 G IV cannula into a vein of the right upper arm, the circulation stabilised after rapid transfusion of 40 ml blood and 25 ml thrombocytes and resuscitation was successful.	1.1127426601957104
Paediatricians and anaesthesiologists must consider the risk of thrombosis of the vena cava.	0.8783809416194143
If venous lines in the lower limbs are not visible to the anaesthesiologist during the operation, venipuncture of veins of an upper limb is recommended before starting the surgical procedure.	1.0648774009348585
Due to the high incidence of vena cava thrombosis caused by central venous lines and the difficulty of peripheral venipuncture in pre-termintanty, a safe venous line should be inserted if necessary by pre-operative venesection.	1.0410578749781645
While complementary medicine and homeopathy is becoming an increasingly prominent part of the health care practices, there is a lack of controlled studies concerning their effectiveness.	0.9276462610010832
In our study, we wanted to answer the question whether a combination of Formica rufa D6 and reinjection of the patient's own blood is superior to injection of placebo.	1.084521938047844
104 patients with ankylosing spondylitis entered a prospective, randomized, double-blind study.	0.6413698697833703
During four weeks they received twice weekly either 1 ml of Formica rufa D6 in combination with 0.5 ml of blood or 1.5 ml NaCl intramuscular.	1.14386563889364
Before and after therapy, mobility, thoracic excursion and doctor's overall assessment were measured in addition to patient's health status, using a German version of the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales, before and after therapy as well as four, twelve, and twentyfour weeks later.	1.1008705155046627
We were not able to detect any statistical difference between treatment and placebo group in any of the parameters measured.	0.9928577271361706
Therefore, the therapy under study may not be regarded effective.	1.0777516088982262
A 32-year-old man was accused of attempted rape.	0.8951287178931792
While urinating at the side of the road he felt an erection.	0.7264818172957557
He approached a 9-year-old girl who happened to be coming along and pressed his penis between her legs until ejaculation.	0.8957669387613342
Shortly afterwards he was arrested.	0.5552536208611644
He confessed, but claimed partial amnesia and had no explanation for the offence, which he normally would never have thought of.	1.0661578872940949
Shortly before the event a witness had seen him nearby in a poor state of orientation.	0.8393442231330333
Three months later in prison he suffered massive subarachnoidal hemorrhage from an aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery.	0.984520233035642
The evaluation of his legal responsibility must take account of a putative psychomotor seizure at the time of the offence.	0.9656673643907225
With regard to the aneurysm diagnosed later, a pathogenetic connection, in terms of a preceding warning leak, might be assumed.	1.1005027785506718
We present a 43-year-old patient who has had up to 15 frontal lobe seizures nightly for 12 years.	1.0296407517324873
The patient had no complaints apart from excessive daytime sleepiness.	0.970832076022713
Neurological and psychiatric examination as well as cerebral computed tomograph and magnetic resonance imaging were normal.	0.8899473520166703
After sleep deprivation an interictal electro-encephalogram demonstrated a recurrent excess of theta activity over the right frontal and frontopolar area.	0.768144707639732
A cerebral PET study showed diminished glucose metabolism of the right cingular and frontomesial region.	0.9567295995118709
The sleep structure was extremely fragmented.	0.5848512912121347
There was an excessive reduction of slow-wave sleep and REM sleep.	0.9512396596303094
Carbamazepine therapy produced complete seizure control lasting a few weeks, followed by return of up to 8 seizures per night.	0.8991301333022323
Vigabatrin as add on therapy diminished the noctural seizures to 1 to 3 per night.	0.8250243200616798
Introduction: We attempted to optimize the determination of energy expenditure and substrate utilisation in VLBW infants for practical use in a tertiary care center.	1.026613770673575
The influence of measuring conditions upon results as well as of caloric intake and food composition on substrate utilisation and growth were investigated.	0.9584964400270493
We report a truck driver with severe soft tissue contusion of both legs who developed atypical heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) after a thrombosis prophylaxis with unfractionated heparin; despite a thrombosis the patient showed a systemic allergic reaction to heparin in combination with elevation of thrombocytes and positive heparin-dependent antibodies.	1.0710225314683335
Six days after the initial trauma deep vein thrombosis of the left lower leg was diagnosed and fasciotomy was performed, preventing an imminent compartment syndrome.	1.1477466679010804
Another 5 days later the patient developed exanthema of the trunk and upper extremities and urticaria on his face, as well as severe headache.	1.1122649894430137
His platelet count increased from 134 000/µl to 258 000/µl.	0.6840030378813287
After exclusion of other causes for these symptoms, a reaction to heparin-dependent antibodies (heparin-platelet-factor 4 complex) was demonstrated 2 days later.	1.10061929712125
Thrombosis prophylaxis was changed to hirudin (Refludan) and elevation of thrombocytes to 445 000/µl was noted.	0.8666664446745366
Shortly after rinsing of an intravenous line with less than 50 IE unfractionated heparin at day 36 after trauma the patient developed an anaphylactic shock, which could be managed with cortisone.	1.0567866904886114
We suggest that in HIT the thrombocytopenia may represent only one form of an allergic reaction to heparin.	0.8299345697018111
The cause of the thrombembolic event is an antigen-antibody reaction to heparin taking place on the surface of the thrombocyte.	0.940972536591007
This is similar in all forms of systemic reaction to heparin application, even though the symptoms may vary.	1.1407398009267176
As thrombocytopenia may not be the main symptom of a heparin-induced antibody reaction - in our hospital only 5 of 10 patients with HIT - the disease should rather be named "heparin allergy".	1.326437292790188
We suggest a new classification of different pattern of heparin allergy types I-IV.	0.9845594085188465
The new types I and II are similar to HIT types I and II.	0.7814336662081321
Type III is the reaction of antibodies without decrease of thrombocytes, and type IV the reaction of antibodies associated with systemic allergic symptoms.	1.0706067904933918
In recent years, lengthening the human mandible by distraction osteogenesis has become an accepted treatment to correct severe mandibular hypoplasia.	0.8663998711640132
Using intraoral unidirectional and extraoral bidirectional distraction devices we report about our experiences and results in the application of the bone distraction technique in four selected cases of syndromal disease, including various forms of mandibular hypoplastic malformations.	1.1461925466131357
The patients involved were a boy with Pierre Robin syndrome, a girl with unilateral facial hypoplasia in Goldenhar's syndrome, a case with Nager's syndrome, and a rare case of midline deficiency caused by partial deletion of chromosome 18 (18p-syndrome).	1.0844324912639878
The distraction period lasted from 6 to 30 days and new bone formation, ranging from 6 to 28 mm, was achieved.	1.0504712472308222
Real leg length discrepancies may be cosmetically disturbing and lead to gait abnormalities, pelvic obliquity with subsequent lumbar scoliosis as well as functional disturbances of hip, knee and ankle joint.	0.9294774524515481
Morbidity and mortality after reversal of Hartmann's procedure following perforated sigmoid diverticulitis are high and the rate of intestinal restoration is low.	0.9182800896948105
Aim: To investigate whether laparoscopically assisted reversal of Hartmann's procedure is technically feasible and whether the laparoscopic procedure offers any benefit to the patient.	1.0002031279603067
Method: Nineteen patients were investigated.	1.025027379399979
The postoperative course was followed prospectively.	0.8828543379795618
All patients were reinvestigated 9 months after surgery.	1.0299985040711273
Results: Laparoscopic reversal of Hartmann's procedure was attempted in 19 patients.	0.9476842756176853
One patient did not want the laparoscopic technique.	0.657076774222038
In two cases (11 %) conversion to the conventional technique was necessary; thus, 16 patients were operated laparoscopically.	1.3376896271477363
Median operative time was 114 (65-180) min.	1.0909383785762796
With the exception of three wound infections no immediate postoperative complications were noticed.	0.9500390131759692
Patients' convalescence was fast.	0.49561094195445127
First evacuation took place 3.3 (3-5) days after surgery, complete oral nutrition 3.6 (3-5) days after surgery.	1.2005177460974474
Duration of postoperative hospitalisation was 7.5 (5-12) days.	1.2794247901303704
One patient developed later a clinically significant anastomotic stricture which needed endoscopic dilatation.	0.8930487024055819
Conclusion: Laparoscopically assisted Hartmann's reversal is technically demanding but feasible.	1.0254818471013751
Postoperative morbidity is low, duration of hospitalisation short, convalescence fast.	0.7550858131072042
Thus, good arguments exist for performing reversal of Hartmann's procedures laparoscopically.	1.1684005393668466
Mechanical ventilation is a well-etablished strategy in intensive care medicine.	0.8182861785961125
ICU trauma patients require analgesia, and sedation mostly consists of benzodiazepines and opioids with increasing doses over time.	0.9882185650352044
The weaning period is complicated by the withdrawal syndrome, showing tachycardia, hypertonia, tachypnea and restlessness.	0.872683979366546
Although treatment with clonidine can influence these symptoms, tachypnea still remains the main problem in weaning patients from mechanical ventilation.	0.9543217678040858
Adding sufentanil, an opioid with greater effects on analgesia than on respiratory depression compared with fentanyl, tachypnea can be reduced to normal frequency.	1.089729562889566
In this way weaning management can be managed more easily for the benefit of both, the patient and physician.	1.2596464555787164
In comparison with a group of 50 patients treated with clonidine alone, 72 patients treated with clonidine/sufentanil showed a shorter period from the start of spontaneous ventilation until extubation (4.8 vs 7.6 days) and until discharge from the ICU (7.7 vs 12.4 days).	1.2319648970498787
The number of reintubations caused by respiratory exhaustion decreased from 16.0 to 2.8 %.	0.9291772152552565
Background: With regard to penetrating keratoplasty methods to culture corneal donor tissues, microsurgical techniques, HLA typing and understanding of basic mechanisms in inflammation and especially graft rejection, and postoperative treatment schedules have been improved in recent years.	1.089208696573852
This now enables successful penetrating keratoplasty in many more patients than previously performed.	0.8345260407538674
However, in rare cases relevant problems in wound closure may appear.	1.0995242274091692
The occurrence of a new influenza virus subtype in 1997 in Hongkong caused only minor outbreaks due to the swift and determined actions of the institutions involved.	0.9195564702127373
However, this incident again made it clear that an influenza pandemic is still a pending threat.	1.1400075226409154
As a result the WHO presented a pandemic preparedness plan which is to facilitate the global measures taken to fight an imminent or ongoing pandemic.	1.04927773006173
Strong efforts of influenza surveillance and the coordination of worldwide measures are essential to this plan.	0.8098038007941682
Furthermore the WHO suggested the developement and introduction of similar national preparedness plans.	0.8100566403703005
Given the high mortality of severe sepsis and septic shock, immunomodulation has been considered as an attractive adjunct therapy.	0.9872138908742247
Many agents have been studied that have the therapeutic potential to interfere with cytokines and other pathways which are activated during sepsis.	0.9368678432872785
Drugs having the properties to neutralize lipopolysaccharides have also been considered.	0.6948771830762954
So far all the large clinical trials with immunomodulating agents (HA1A, E5, anti TNF antibodies, ILra) have been shown to be of marginal or of no benefit.	1.1128383059403537
In certain trials results were indecisive, or mortality was increased which led to discontinue the studies.	0.9455010819419819
In certain other trials, like those on antibodies against TNF, some positive effects were seen in subcategories of patients.	1.0719344283684578
Thus, new trials are on their ways.	1.3249016142386252
So far the results of early trials has forced investigators to re-examine the concept of immunomodulation, and to redefine strategies to optimally use agents in a way that benefits the host, while not putting him at risk.	1.1347330871163561
Recently, percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy (PDT) has become more frequent, since the technique can be mastered relatively easily.	1.3123652535017893
PDT is neither time-consuming nor does it require much personell or material.	0.8293674897493567
Our study seeks to evaluate PDT in terms of its effectivness and practicality on a cardio-surgical ICU.	0.7779731852303263
Recently, two new halogenated volatile anaesthetics, sevoflurane and desflurane, have been approved for clinical use in Germany.	1.161531559378927
Their low solubility in blood is the most important common property, and this represents the most obvious difference from the inhalational anaesthetics currently used.	1.1708982809357436
Extensive clinical and experimental evaluations have confirmed the superior pharmacokinetic properties predicted.	0.8497542859457103
Both sevoflurane and desflurane provide more rapid emergence from anaesthesia, permit easier titration of the anaesthetic dose during maintenance and offer more rapid recovery from anaesthesia.	0.8632605938360671
For sevoflurane, there are additional advantages: a pleasant odor, negligible airway irritation, and excellent pharmacodynamic characteristics that even provide cardiovascular stability comparable to isoflurane.	1.1001405360774903
A certain disadvantage and source of potential nephrotoxicity result from the metabolism of sevoflurane (2-5%) to anorganic fluoride and degradation to compound A in carbon dioxide absorbents.	1.1057778334728146
The extensive clinical data reported to date have revealed no evidence that sevoflurane has adverse renal effects.	1.036637739804731
New insight into the pathomechanism of nephrotoxicity associated with either production of fluoride or compound A may well support clinical experience.	0.7997617295082725
Desflurane strongly resists in vivo metabolism and because of this it appears to be devoid of toxicity.	0.7508925146012793
Nevertheless, potential side-effects may result from degradation in dry absorbents and subsequent release of CO, from its extreme pungency and irritating airway effects.	1.1226974745651386
Thus, desflurane is not recommended for induction of anaesthesia, especially in children.	1.2890881985195914
The tendency for desflurane transiently to stimulate sympathetic activity, especially at concentrations above 1.0 MAC, limits its application in patients with cardiac disease.	1.1670704361989719
The doctor in charge, who is generally the medical director, is liable if patients suffer harm through organizational faults within his or her department.	1.0933736982927895
Even the suspicion that an error has arisen as the result of defective organization is enough for the person responsible - that is to say the medical director - to be liable.	1.191900048717418
For this reason, the doctor in charge must be in a position to recognize structural defects in organization and to correct these by means of staff training.	1.0814643416340457
Every training measure must guarantee specialist standards; this means that the work of doctors with no specialist training and those still in training and working under supervision is guaranteed to be of the same standard and performed with the same degree of meticulous care as that of a qualified specialist.	1.1385821469914048
A legally valid consent from the patient and documentation of the patient information must be accessible at all times.	1.1252477642317864
Operations carried out by doctors in training must be supervised by a qualified specialist; otherwise the doctor in charge is guilty of a defect in organization.	0.9389037291892872
Because of staff shortages it often happens that inexperienced beginners - often doctors doing their practical training - are on call very early on.	1.0763409042742187
In the high-risk specialty of obstetrics it is particularly important that doctors still undergoing practical training can call on an experienced colleague for help at all times.	1.0189030371406718
The changeover from day duty to emergency duty must be organized by the doctor in charge in such a way that the medical staff are rested and that adequate free time is guaranteed.	0.9512090088590185
There must be no friction when cooperation with other disciplines concerned is needed.	0.7754550269507874
Each sector must know its own area of responsibility.	0.7056452294648665
The doctor in charge is resonsible for seeing that his or her staff members are familiar with the use of the medical equipment.	0.8838892635147403
Uniform guidelines will make it possible for the medical director to train his/her staff and prevent systematic organizational defects.	0.9539117371626911
Georg Friedrich Stromeyer (1804- 1876) is generally known as one of the founders of orthopedics and orthopedic surgery and also made many contributions to modern military medicine.	0.9497688821931085
Furthermore, every oral and maxillofacial surgeon in Germany knows him because of the "Stromeyer hook", which is used for elevation of zygomatic arch fractures.	1.3301576199265
This special aspect as well as Stromeyer's biography is presented in this article from the history of medicine.	1.0262428993658959
Changes in clinical presentation of Crohn's disease (CD), patients' age at the time of disease manifestation and operation, general condition and duration of medical management were investigated in a retrospective study.	1.2005353230870957
395 operations for CD were divided into consecutive groups and analysed.	0.8342603600128008
In an increasing number of cases patients presented with the "fibrostenotic type" rather than the "fistulizing type" of complaints.	1.1092273988815422
The duration of disease and of medical management increased.	1.152755140391941
Patients in later groups were younger and in better general condition.	0.7964021553943281
We found a rise in frequency of patients with recurrent CD or prior abdominal surgery for other reasons.	1.0503708104037768
Primary surgery for CD increasingly consisted of resection of solitary segments of gut; in the case of recurrence, of multiple, minimal resections.	1.1503446594956095
The average total length of the resected intestine could be significantly reduced.	0.8873929789529774
The complication rate was equal in elective and emergency surgery.	0.8325744443855171
Even among the uncommon aneurysms of the visceral arteries the aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenalis artery is considered a rarity.	0.9058195164089209
Etiologically, numerous factors must be taken into account, the most significant one being arteriosclerosis.	1.2519654133655518
The clinical presentation is unspecific and ambiguous.	0.8717432714157533
CT and, above all, intra-arterial DSA allow for a diagnosis.	0.8846579952940241
A generous consideration of indicating operative intervention, even in asymptomatic patients, is especially justified because of the imminent risk of rupture.	1.1185125404602279
The preferrable therapy consists of elimination of the aneurysm either conventionally by proximal and distal ligature of the pancreaticoduodenalis artery or endovascularly by embolization.	0.8787965602235652
In the future a treatment with coated stents (TPEG) would also seem possible.	1.0161128698838038
Special attention must be paid to concomitant occlusive disease in other visceral arteries since measures for vessel reconstruction may be required because of intraoperative impairment of the collateral circulation.	0.9241917132869069
We report on the rupture of an aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenal inferior artery in association with celiac axis occlusion.	0.9968179940877127
Background: Clinical courses of eight patients with urea cycle disorders (deficiencies of carbamylphosphate-synthetase (4), argininosuccinate-synthetase (2) and argininosuccinate-lyase (2) ) are described.	1.3066400798456081
Methods/Therapy: Emergency treatment consisted of benzoate and arginine i. v. as well as peritoneal dialysis and/or modified hemodialysis.	0.9637491408901852
Chronic treatment comprised a low-protein diet and substitution of essential amino acids, of benzoate or phenylbutyrate and of branched-chain amino acids.	0.9608702989013193
Results: Within 72 hours after birth hyperammonemic coma with cerebral edema developed, leading to developmental retardation later in life.	1.0647534125866758
Four patients died between 2 weeks and 4 years of age.	0.9944203995191115
During follow-up, all patients suffered hyperammonemic derangements treated conservatively.	1.0181707463874177
Phenylbutyrate had less gastrointestinal side-effects than benzoate, branched-chain amino acids had favourable effects.	0.803646351072268
One patient was treated conservatively since birth followed by a normal development.	1.1568756094396175
Conclusions: Neonatal respiratory distress with alkalosis and rapid global deterioration should raise the suspicion of a urea cycle disorder.	0.9616465460666831
Specific therapy as described can be life-saving, although most children exhibit marked developmental delay.	1.0674116217137564
Sodium phenylbutyrate has fewer side-effects than sodium benzoate.	0.8340410784517491
Therapy prior to cerebral edema can prevent complications.	0.7573969320934083
Pronounced osteoporosis of and surrounding the acetabulum commonly leads to early loosening of endoprosthetic hip replacements following implantation.	0.8034057689832209
Large osseous defects in the subimplant bed are the result and the reason why multiple revisions of loosened acetabular cups have to be performed so often in rheumatic surgery.	1.0281978685414963
The defects extend from the cranial to the central; ventral and dorsal anchorage losses may occur in addition to this.	1.0682979177951422
The anchorage of a new implant must be adapted to the individual circumstances.	1.008960922199948
The new implant must be selected in accordance with point of surgical access, the patient's general status and osseous regenerationability.	1.1560388264676889
In the optimum case, osseous buildup of lost anatomical structures is the preferred method.	0.8401717357839016
If this is not possible, special implants, mostly custom-made prostheses, have to be incorporated.	1.0753997056712563
However, the survival time of the implants is much shorter than in patients with degenerative diseases.	1.3071197808820705
In patients with progressive muscular dystrophy (PMD) invasive electrophysiologic studies can detect hidden intracardiac conduction disturbances.	0.882317194536446
The aim of this study was a long-term follow-up of these patients.	1.1846033228773185
Twelve consecutive patients (9m, 3f, age 28 +/- 4 yrs) without cardiac symptoms and with normal echocardiographic findings were included in the study.	1.0939399994542933
They suffered from different stages of PMD type Erb (n=4), Becker-Kiener (n=4), Duchenne (n=2) and Landouzy-Déjerine (n=2).	0.9716902920437139
At the beginning of the study all patients underwent an invasive electrophysiologic study (EPS).	1.0452106432574013
The follow-up of 5.5 yrs included regular clinical visits, ECGs, and Holter recordings (every 3 months) as well as an echocardiography every 6 months.	1.1318758911265459
In 4 patients the EPS revealed a hidden interatrial conduction disturbance (AHRS-ACS 120 +/- 18ms), and in 10 pts an infrahisian conduction disturbance was found (HV max.	1.0364608979669878
Conduction defects were seen independently from the type of PMD and the stage of the disease.	0.859356650809559
During the follow-up the initially hidden interatrial conduction disturbance became evident in the surface ECG in 2 of 4 pts.	1.0164900231994882
One of them developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.	0.747679944512003
Five of 10 pts with an initially hidden infrahisian conduction disturbance developed an AV block grade I-III and in one case additionally a bundle branch block.	0.9867639625819276
Four of these pts - whose PMD showed progression or who developed congestive cardiomyopathy - needed pacemaker implantation because of a first-degree AV block + bifascicular bundle branch block (n=1), a Mobitz II second-degree AV block (n=1) or a third-degree AV block (n=2).	1.092351935497561
None of the pts with normal findings at the EPS showed abnormal p-waves, an AV block, or an intraventricular conduction disturbance during the follow-up.	1.0408926039987425
We conclude that intracardiac conduction disturbances, especially infrahisian defects including high-degree AV blocks, are a common finding in pts with PMD.	1.2540734553748378
Therefore a regular cardiological screening including an ECG and a Holter recording is reasonable in these patients.	0.8192594770285861
Accidental hypothermia is defined as an unintentional decline in the core temperature below 35 °C and is caused by exposure to cold, drugs, endocrine dysfunction, central nervous system disorders, skin disorders, and trauma.	1.0303581138343991
Depending on the degree of hypothermia, there is a progressive depression of metabolism in each organ system with specific alterations.	1.0712033280912345
Bone is among the most common sites of metastatic disease in cancers of the breast, prostate, and lung.	1.184470221411544
The decision about systemic therapy depends on the histology, presence and extent of extraskeletal disease, and the performance status of the patient.	1.128781786804624
For patients with estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer or prostate cancer, hormonal treatment represents the treatment of choice.	1.0184400253175772
In estrogen-receptor-negative breast cancer, and for patients who have failed hormonal therapy or have liver metastases, chemotherapy should be initiated.	1.1829672837986471
All patients with small-cell lung cancer should receive chemotherapy.	0.9168933857768361
Bone metastases of differentiated thyroid cancers can be treated with radioisotopes.	0.927019623333467
In non-small-cell lung cancer or renal cell cancer, systemic chemotherapy should be confined to younger patients and patients in good general condition.	1.0000462970745727
Radiologic assessment of responses of skeletal metastases to systemic therapy is often difficult.	0.9985235466821296
New approaches in measuring bone metabolites in urine might prove helpful.	0.7535830073899413
Although most prenatally diagnosed anatomic malformations are best managed after birth, we can presently offer prenatal therapy to an increasing number of fetuses with simple anatomical defects that have predictably devastating developmental consequences.	0.9907414698354796
A condition amenable to prenatal intervention must fulfill a number of conditions.	0.7456178547189357
It must be severe enough to warrant the risks associated with in utero treatment and must be reliably detectable before birth.	0.889775603717629
Furthermore, the pathophysiology must be reversible by fetal intervention, significantly improving the prognosis over postnatal treatment.	1.0331252399759465
Current indication for prenatal intervention include decompression for obstructive uropathy, temporary tracheal occlusion for congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and tumor debulking for congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lung and sacrococcygeal teratoma.	1.0589134462525438
Prenatal repair of myelomeningocele is currently being developed but remains controversial since this is not a lethal malformation.	1.0066485585314444
Maternal safety remains paramount in considering fetal intervention.	0.5991247145996748
The main associated risks are pre-term labor and preterm premature rupture of membranes.	0.8284019766487197
To reduce maternal morbidity and the risk of prematurity, minimally invasive fetoscopic techniques were developed and are increasingly employed.	0.9658408808225407
These developments will in all probability reduce the importance of open fetal surgery in the future.	0.8870663314510745
Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) has become an important cause of severe infection in hospitalized patients all over the world.	1.1184723007958866
In Germany a significant increase of nosocomial infections due to MRSA has occurred during the last 10 years.	0.8627658467674929
Especially elderly patients with chronic illnesses are at increased risk of becoming colonized or infected with MRSA.	1.0227965295752337
This report focuses on epidemiology and therapy of MRSA, and on the recommendations concerning management and prevention of spread of MRSA in hospitals and nursing homes.	1.0248687854663752
During general anaesthesia gas climate significantly is improved by performance of low flow techniques.	0.825585020079073
Gas climatisation, however, markedly also will be influenced by the temperature loss at, and corresponding water condensation within the hoses, factors which are related to the technical design and material of the patient hose system.	1.2015189353556814
The objective of this prospective study was to investigate 1. how anaesthetic gas climatisation during minimal flow anaesthesia is influenced by the technical design of different breathing hose systems in clinical practice.	1.1156667072459812
2. to investigate, whether a sufficient gas climatisation also can be gained with higher fresh gas flows if that hose system is used, proven beforehand to optimally warming and humidifying the anaesthetic gases.	1.0584444085710163
Introduction: Undifferentiated, embryonal sarcoma is a rare malignant tumour of the liver, the incidence of which is highest in children between 6 and 10 years of age (14.1 %).	1.216292948032163
Among the primary tumours of the liver in childhood it ranks in third place after hepatocellular carcinoma and focal nodular hyperplasia.	0.955768081387819
Embryonal sarcoma is much rarer in adults.	0.7260853621150805
To our knowledge, only 18 cases have been published in the last 50 years.	1.242976321203689
Methods and results: We now present the case of a 29-year-old woman with spontaneous rupture of the liver caused by an undifferentiated sarcoma.	1.2004201071003182
Conclusion: This case report illustrates the possibility of an embryonal sarcoma being the reason for spontaneous rupture of the liver.	1.3041838340589051
The management of this case comprised primary tamponade, interventional embolisation of the feeding artery, and secondary resection under stable conditions.	1.1264140619972176
Substance dependency is one of the most frequent disorders, which can be treated successfully by psychotherapy.	1.0794713586477782
However reasons are discussed, why psychotherapists probably hesitate in treating these patients.	0.796219917227405
Insufficient psychotherapeutic education concerning dependency, structural problems, expected difficulties with these patients or expected poor treatment outcome may be overcome as well as blind areas in healthprofessionals' perception concerning dependency among their patients and themselves.	0.9476958878075578
Though psychotherapy with addicts is sometimes exhausting, the readiness of psychotherapists to treat patients with substance disorders is increasing.	0.9651379145854452
Diagnosis nowadays is based on the distinction between drug depencency and drug abuse on the one hand and substance induced disorders on the other hand.	0.9039667890733936
Readiness for change and motivation for treatment are basic objects of psychotherapy in these patients.	0.9598745143923553
Therapeutic approaches to deal with this promising aspect of psychotherapy are presented.	0.8005188665128193
They are based on an empathic and clear therapeutic attitude.	0.8680087408674418
They can be easily implemented in different settings.	0.806106106243864
At the end of the first part of this review in- patient and outpatient settings for the treatment of substance disorders are outlined.	1.1639535830248617
This will be followed in the second part by an outline of different specific psychotherapeutic approaches.	0.986926668158632
The following experimental study was conducted to develop biocompatible methods of osteosynthesis in fractures of the distal radius and to evaluate their stability.	1.1220928899834424
A model of dorsal wedge osteotomy in the distal radial metaphysis was used to develop the surgical technique and to test the stability of the alternative methods of osteosynthesis.	1.1624697268781137
The concept for this model was based on commercially available materials which were either biodegradable or osteoconductive.	0.878222680449552
Four different forms of biocompatible osteosynthesis were compared to combined Kirschner wire osteosynthesis (KWO), our preferred method of treatment of unstable Colles fracture.	1.1171442054961618
Biocompatible osteosynthesis was achieved with an invasivity and stability comparable to that of KWO.	0.9152283597016537
In conclusion, injection osteosynthesis exceeded the other biocompatible methods of osteosynthesis in all respects.	0.9963363152972065
Regarding the recent developments in injectable materials for osteosynthesis it offers the best perspective for clinical application.	0.8736411309727278
The "pain in the lower limbs" (growing pain) represent one of the most frequent complaint pictures in the child orthopaedic consulting hour.	1.2393962855272014
The delimitation compared to other diseases is difficult and laborious on account of many differential diagnoses.	0.9732323206743196
Destination of our investigations was it to set up a standardized investigation diagram with recording all differential diagnoses.	0.8366231711163522
In psychotherapy with patients who do not tolerate the conditions of the 'talking cure' because they tend to act instead of verbalizing their experiences interactive entanglements are rather common.	0.852385433572318
Often this is a consequence of nonverbal gestural behavior that directs interaction in the therapeutic dialogue while the exchange of words has taken a back seat.	1.0101442825910398
The symbolic space of verbal understanding gets lost then.	0.6367669500564161
Gestural behavior does not form an independent communication system as usage of 'body language' suggests.	0.773468768610038
Instead as permanent concomitant of utterances it has primarily the function of regulating the interaction of patient and psychotherapist.	0.8862824665056305
The surgical treatment of varicous veins demands complete exclusion of the primary recirculation circuit.	0.8860683279986726
The diagnosis is made on the basis of the clinical and ultrasound symptoms, on i.e.	1.2024259374059016
If there is saphenous vein agreement between them, phlebography will yield no additional information concerning the strategy for operation.	0.8966194200899852
The prospective comparative examination of non-invasive diagnostic methods versus phlebography shows different results in 12% of cases for the great saphenous vein and in 3% for the small with a correction of the operative procedure.	1.3282160868468262
In 10 cases of incomplete trunk varicosis, only one diagnosis was correct with non-invasive measures.	1.1831614151843992
This leads to the conclusion that phlebography should be done at the time of the preoperative examination if there are differences between the clinical and ultrasound symptoms.	1.242174652877029
Undislocated odontoid fractures may lead on the basis of conventional x-rays only to a wrong conclusion with regard to biomechanical aspect of stability.	0.9922229043852862
In this aspect the classification based on Anderson and D'Alonzo takes a high risk to missunderstood the fracture stability and can results in a secondary fracture dislocation.	1.0453973148152014
Therefore it is important to make the decision about operative versus nonoperative treatment on the base of the trauma mechanism.	1.0981073080079344
In this case report we elucidate this problem and the higher risk of anterior approach for correction.	1.1107150431583646
Furthermore a better classification of densfractures will be recommended.	0.7062810812035794
In a period of 4 years between March 1994 and March 1998, 143 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) underwent laparoscopic antireflux surgery.	0.9673477398150939
According to manometric studies 76 patients had a short-floppy Nissen fundoplication, patients with impaired motility or paraesophageal hernias received a hemifundoplication (Toupet = 42, Dor/Thal = 25).	0.9376283593137904
Recurrent reflux symptoms appeared in 6,3 % after mean 16,7 months follow-up (Nissen = 2.6 %, Toupet = 2.3 %, Dor/Thal = 24 %, P < 0.01).	1.1025667284338951
Persistent dysphagia with reoperation occurred in 2.1 % (Nissen = 2.6 %, Toupet = 2.3 %, Dor/Thal = 0 %, n. s.).	1.1256212167037514
The assessment of Visick's score at the latest control showed the following: Visick I = 63.6 %, Visick II = 30.1 %, Visick III = 6.3 %, Visick IV = 0 %.	1.1738527074564988
The outcome of the operation was rated "excellent" or "good" by 91.6 % of the patients.	0.9215558033807073
In contrast to auditory brainstem potentials (ABR), a more apically defined generation of middle latency evoked potentials (MLR) can be assumed due to the longer integration time present.	1.1901561374595027
To date, the effect of stimulus frequency spectra on MLR has not been completely known.	0.8723928443852002
By using masking with high-pass filtered white noise in 12 normal-hearing adults, we measured the dependence of amplitude and latency of ABR and MLR on filter frequency.	0.9958034224095279
No differences were found between the masking effects for ABR and MLR evoked by tone bursts of 0.5 and 2 kHz.	1.0695701937479334
The high-pass masking of click stimuli showed a greater influence on the amplitude and latency of the ABR than on MLR.	1.0659359295240984
These different qualities have to be considered clinically when evaluating the methods and results of hearing testing with acoustic evoked potentials.	1.1122898311274783
Our findings show that MLR evoked by tone bursts should be used for the frequency selective diagnosis of hearing thresholds, especially in low- frequency ranges.	1.1653993466221333
Objectives: To clarify the incidence of sudden arrythmic death and associated risk factors in patients after orthotopic heart transplantation (HTx).	1.1233483837351648
Background: Some reports indicate a significant rate of sudden death in heart transplant recipients limiting long-term success of the operation.	1.34984098970458
Incidence, underlying risk factors, etiologies, and methods for prediction or prevention of sudden death are poorly defined.	1.0078173962107542
Methods: Retrospective analysis of our cohort of 120 cardiac allograft recipients surviving the perioperative phase out of a total of 142HTx patients of the years 1984-1999.	1.12828363696602
Clinical events (death, mode of death, Re-HTx, resuscitation) were noted and analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and related to the patients' characteristics by multivariate analysis.	1.10651722079836
Sudden death in or out of hospital was defined as death within one hour of symptoms or unwittnessed death.	0.9570372861733576
Clinical and postmortem findings (autopsies are available in 12/18 sudden death patients) were correlated to the mode of death.	1.0489355208612912
Results: During a mean follow-up interval of 4.6 +/- 3.5 years, 45 patients died (38%).	1.292690845942267
The mode of death was non-sudden in 27 inpatients.	0.8609066922499387
18 deaths were sudden, 14 of these out of hospital.	0.9673147498983341
In addition there were three cardiac arrests with successful resuscitations, one of those patients died three month later suddenly, giving a number of a total of 21 cardiac arrests in 20HTx patients.	1.1324623900752777
The actuarial risk of cardiac arrest was 20% after 6 and 40% after 12 years.	1.4417964376135013
Based on postmortem analysis the etiologies of the events were attributed to transplant vasculopathy in 15 patients, rejection in 5 patients (International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation grade >3A), and to unknown reasons in one.	1.0705170633556624
All three patients successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest had documented bradycardic events (2xtotal AV block, 1xsinus arrest).	0.7789402528706537
Pacemakers were implanted in these patients.	0.6224229148235373
One of those died suddenly 2 months later.	0.8188532064863455
Significantly more HTx patients dying suddenly are smokers, had a lower left ventricular ejection fraction, and worse hemodynamics.	0.9863484622840274
QRS width and PR interval were significantly broadened in patients with transplant vasculopathy and cardiac arrest.	0.8386081987603029
In three cases, a decrease in heart rate variability, the occurence of sustained VT, and ST segment depressions prior to the cardiac arrest could be demonstrated.	1.0799963293269583
Conclusions: Sudden death occurs at a substantial rate after HTx.	1.1562095841773752
As HTx patient numbers are rising constantly, sudden cardiac death in this population will represent a significant problem.	1.005693351063435
In our patients about 75% of the arrests can be attributed to graft-vasculopathy and one quarter to acute rejection.	1.1101364013716666
Diagnostic strategies have to be developed to detect patients at risk.	0.9478732731901842
Interestingly, some events may be caused from bradyarrhythmic rhythm disturbances.	1.0855293492920792
Introduction: Traumatic dislocation is the most severe ligamentous injury of the knee.	1.3237049443933344
The indications for operative and conservative treatment are still controversial.	0.8779254613240209
Methods and results: From 1974 to 1994, 38 patients with documented knee dislocation were treated operatively in our department.	1.150531110560986
Thirty-four of these patients were followed up for 3-16 years (mean: 8.6 years).	1.1780270933421335
In 29 cases of the follow-up group, reconstruction of both cruciate ligaments was performed.	0.9604502046662958
In the remaining cases the cruciate ligaments were left alone.	0.9629660628706996
At the time of follow-up, 90 % of the patients showed good knee stability, but 90 % had lack of motion as well.	1.2704629353475623
Post-traumatic osteoarthritis was mostly mild to moderate.	0.7326880674693343
Thirty-five percents of the patients achieved excellent to good results in the Lysholm Score.	1.1240590428845758
Conclusions: Positive prognostic factors were an age less than 40 years at the time of the accident, a low-energy trauma, e. g., a sports-related injury, early reconstruction of both cruciate ligaments, and initial postoperative functional treatment.	1.1901630696835208
Huntington's disease (HD) is member of a growing family of neurodegenerative diseases which are caused by a CAG-Triplet expansion in the coding region of their respective genes.	0.9666666950470938
The results of the research of the last years is very suggestive of a common pathomechanisms of all these diseases even though their clinical appearance may be quite different.	1.206031207119042
The development of new animal models by transferring the human gene defect into the mouse genome has led to the finding of so-called intranuclear inclusion bodies.	0.939378765129456
This new observation allowed to come closer to solving the problem how this genetic defect causes neurodegeneration.	0.8040054373226468
Recent studies on transgenic HD mice could also demonstrate a possible connection between the genetic defect and glutamate exitotoxicity in the neurodegenerative process of HD which had been emphasized by earlier animal models of the disease.	0.9422072711262949
Transgenic animal models of HD will have an important impact on the understanding of the disease mechanisms and may contribute to a faster development and testing of new therapeutic approaches.	1.1610645457124547
Background: The Whipple operation (PD) is the standard operation in patients with cancer of the head of the pancreas and the periampullary region.	1.2968613246893417
However, the pylorus-preserving duodenopancreatectomy (PPPD) is supposed to be superior in gastrointestinal function.	1.2407231846722921
Methods: In a prospective randomized trial (October 1994-October 1998) PD and PPPD were compared in terms of global and gastrointestinal quality of life, operation time, duration of hospital stay, transfusions and perioperative morbidity.	1.041144054699943
Quality of life was analyzed under standardized conditions (EORTC-QLQ-30) pre- and postoperatively (weeks 2, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60).	1.1352108759685438
Results: A duodenopancreatectomy was performed in 48 patients because of cancer of the head of the pancreas (n = 38) and the periampullary region (n = 10) (PD, n = 24; PPPD, n = 24).	1.3571872243010306
The PD and PPPD groups did not differ according to age, gender or UICC stage.	0.8404770983522428
Operation time was shorter in the PPPD group (206  +/-  48 vs 306  +/-  54 min) (P < 0.05).	0.9244568701148616
Morbidity did not differ between the two groups (PPPD 20 % vs PD 30 %, P > 0.05).	1.2644952477022766
While there was no difference in global quality of life, gastrointestinal quality of life was postoperatively increased in the PPPD group regarding appetite, nausea and diarrhea (P < 0.05).	0.8825904695574448
While the preoperative body weight was reached after 6 months in 85 % of the PPPD group (n = 20), this was true in only 60 % of the PD-group (n = 14) (P < 0.05).	1.1828328018412142
Conclusion: PPPD seems to be associated with a better postoperative gastrointestinal quality of life than PD.	1.1725821774648972
Oxygen uptake (V.O2) and carbon dioxide elimination (V.CO2) can be measured with an indirect calorimeter; this method is well established in routine monitoring of ICU patients to evaluate metabolic state as a reflection of stress.	1.1826286656487022
In various experimental studies it was demonstrated that anaesthetics can influence whole-body metabolism.	0.8587550465687948
The purpose of this study was to examine whether indirect calorimetry can be used intraoperatively during routine anaesthesia and whether presumable changes in metabolism can be detected immediately.	1.0479988476733264
Abdominal aortic cross-clamping changes circulation, nutritional supply of the lower extremities and thus V.O2 and V.CO2.	1.039987740870417
We therefore used this operation for our study.	0.7563932123822276
For certain indications, anterior fusion of the lumbar spine is a standard operation.	1.106934237158147
The surgeon specializing in operations on the vertebral column must leam to utilize the advantages of laparoscopic surgery.	0.8161922055287251
However, an absolute must before applying the technique to humans is adequate training in its use in living animals.	1.1862227645435153
For this purpose, the pig is a highly suitable model.	1.0381333936246753
The surgical team comprises a surgeon experienced in spinal procedures, an abdominal surgeon with expertise in laparoscopic surgery and an experienced cameraman.	1.0799732311517005
In the animal model, a change in position - organ preparation from the cranial direction, a suprasymphysial approach to the vertebrae - has proved expedient.	1.249210499496881
Operational interventions can be planned and simulated accurately with the help of a three-dimensional reconstruction of the anatomical bone structures, created from the tomographic data of a patient.	1.0043547534851538
Computer-assisted navigation systems or robotic systems can assist the intraoperative realization of the planned intervention and may support the spatial orientation within the operational field.	0.9184034634733401
The desmoplastic type of the squamous cell carcinoma (DSCC) of the skin is an entity which is readily distinguished by light microscopy.	1.243922711758619
The DSCC has fine branches surrounded by a desmoplastic stroma and shows in some cases typical perineural, perivascular and widespread intradermal invasion (maximum 6 cm!).	0.9249351378519362
This type accounts for 8.2% (n=44) of our collective of 594 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the skin and vermilion border.	1.2595055484830846
Clinically DSCC look like other malignant epithelial tumors of the skin.	0.8183202846801197
All tumors were followed up for at least 3 years (maximum 10 years).	1.0052333140721317
The local recurrence rate was high (24.3%) even though micrographic surgery was carried out.	1.193525480124548
The rate of local or regional metastasis was also very high (22.7%).	1.0396847755960135
In comparison the recurrence rate and the rate of metatasis of the remaining common 91.8% SCC's (n=550) was low: 2.6% and 3.8%, respectively.	1.231231436607283
The DSCC seems to be identical with the so called neurotropic SCC, the fine stranded SCC or the SCC with perineural invasion which have a high rate of local recurrence and metastasis as well, but DSCC is a better generic histopathologic term for the entire group.	1.04658122959644
The DSCC is best treated with micrographic surgery and wider safety margins than any other type and should be followed up very frequently.	0.9172553762788156
In the final stage of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) the majority of patients develop chronic respiratory failure due to respiratory muscle weakness.	1.0397858270690885
The interaction between the patient with ALS and the physician should be characterized by continuous communication, especially with respect to the prospect of ventilatory failure and for support.	1.2466099156900605
The patient and his family must be informed thoroughly about the natural history and the prognosis of ALS, depending on the individual disease process.	1.1278687458434962
Already in the early stage of the disease coping strategies should be discussed so that imminent respiratory emergencies can be handled.	1.1604147849963715
If ALS patients are not informed about the acute respiratory insufficiency they run the risk of having to be intubated and mechanically ventilated over a long term.	1.0957703205247742
Background: The advent of multidetector CT (MDCT) constitutes a quantum leap creating a wealth of new opportunities in medical imaging.	0.8765016645272448
However, while the basic principles of spiral CT still apply, we are now challenged to rethink our strategies in planning a CT study to take full advantage of the increased capabilities of MDCT.	1.3249310859151588
Extracorporeal photophoresis (ECP), a therapeutic modality that has been under investigation for some years, is based on separation of a leucocyte/lymphocyte-enriched cell fraction from the peripheral blood, extracorporeal treatment of the cells with 8-MOP/UVA and subsequent reinfusion of the cells in the patient.	1.2083546096107651
Its main effects seem to consist in changes to the immunologic behaviour of the photoinactivated/modulated cells.	0.8050578695891117
The immune response of the host is obviously stimulated by this treatment.	0.9155483845959884
ECP is normally performed for 4 h per day on 2 consecutive days every 4 weeks.	0.8837641703090254
The treatment is well tolerated and causes few side effects.	1.0075251997773507
In our department, 1210 ECP treatments were administered to 41 patients between 1990 and 1994 and a preliminary evaluation was performed.	1.0318689884925478
These patients included 21 with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), 10 with progressive systemic scleroderma, 4 with chronic graft-versus-host disease and 1 each with pemphigus vulgaris, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, lupus erythematosus and cutaneous mucinosis.	1.0919312777051946
Patients with erythroderma and preserved immunocompetence achieved the best responses of all patients with CTCL.	1.0110375224483343
A treatment combining ECP with rlFN-, PUVA and/or radiation was also successful in patients with tumour-stage CTCL and lymph node involvement.	1.0960802620506354
Progressive systemic scleroderma responded in more than 50% of our cases.	0.9473925990388585
Treatment results were impressive in 4 patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease presenting with sclerodermatous and lichenoid changes of the skin and mucous membranes.	1.033361613000686
A clear improvement was also observed in the patient with pemphigus vulgaris refractory to standard therapies and in another patient with scleromyxoedema (Arndt-Gottron syndrome).	1.069173695727092
The effectiveness of ECP seems to be quite well established in CTCL, but remains to be examined in autoimmune dermatoses.	1.0518426935858005
ECP is an attractive addition to the dermatological therapies available but our experience is still preliminary.	1.0237235329298462
Opportunistic infections after long-term treatment with azathioprine (AZA) have not been noted in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG).	0.9998004700971892
We report on a 56-year-old woman with generalized MG who presented with cytomegalovirus infection after being treated with AZA for 17 years.	0.9263787213819996
The indication for immunosuppressive treatment in MG should be regularly reconfirmed, particularly since at least 50% of patients can discontinue AZA after two to four years without risk of exacerbation.	1.1857833173457437
Failure to find the gallbladder at the usual or most common atypical sites during surgery for cholecystolithiasis is a rare but known problem.	1.0760709041975431
Although ultrasonography has 95 % sensitivity for the diagnosis of cholelithiasis, occasionally a small contracted gallbladder with stones and chronic cholecystitis will be difficult to visualize and can lead to erroneous interpretation.	1.0113670518175826
We report on the case of a patient presenting with abdominal colic and ultrasonographically confirmed cholecystolithiasis.	0.9929775150788579
During laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the gallbladder could not be detected.	0.8698307079244966
After laparoscopic staging followed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and abdominal computed tomography, agenesis of the gallbladder was confirmed.	0.8706292394191115
This method can be considered for diagnosis of gallbladder agenesis without the need for laparotomy and thorough exploration.	0.9860332202035659
Right colon diverticulitis, representing 1-3,6 % of cases of diverticular disease is an uncommon cause of right lower quadrant pain.	1.2968977821236838
Its presentation is difficult to distinguish from acute appendicitis.	0.871535988446347
Patients are between 35 and 50 years old, have a history of 2-3 days of abdominal pain and few gastrointestinal symptoms.	1.2193281940468907
The diagnosis is best confirmed by computed tomography and colonoscopy.	1.0063417041924796
Conservative treatment is justified in uncomplicated disease, whereas perforations, abcesses and inflammatory tumors require resection.	1.0617963732057059
We describe the cases of six patients treated at our institution from 1991 to 1996.	1.1968458088665472
Presentation, geographic variations, diagnostic procedures and management are discussed.	0.8618344153222904
Malignant melanoma is the most important differential diagnosis in both clinical and histologic examination of melanocytic nevi.	1.2070964956785275
UV exposure with an erythemagenic dose and mechanical irritation of melanocytic nevi are able to induce reversible morphologic changes which simulate malignant melanoma.	0.8507588176428079
These changes are associated with an increased expression of HMB-45 antigen.	0.9465796174312734
In addition, an increased proliferation and repair activity is observed after UV exposure.	1.2509837743424255
The increased number of melanocytes located in suprabasal layers of the epidermis is accompanied by a change in keratinocyte adhesion molecule expression.	0.9025527251358497
The UV light is also able to influence the adhesive properties of melanocytes in vitro.	0.7821036832244724
Therefore, both keratinocyte-derived factors and direct influence of UV on the melanocyte system are probably responsible for the morphologic changes.	1.1341913041430856
While these exogenously evoked changes are reversible, the potential biologic relevance - especially a possible role in the initiation of the carcinogenesis cascade - reguires clarification.	1.1601298111823775
Objectives Minimally invasive surgical procedure for removal of the trochanteric bursa and, if necessary, exostosectomy and/or fixation of the iliotibial tract at the greater trochanter.	0.8938481437044277
The treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head involves a continuum based on a radiographic spectrum of disease.	1.056632200865088
Core decompression or pharmacological agents can be utilized for the earliest small or medium-sized pre-collapsed lesions.	0.809908074244544
For these types of lesions, osteotomy has been tried by various authors with moderate success.	0.7823527450084438
For small or medium lesions that are post-collapse, various bone grafting procedures have been used.	1.0103862392208298
This approach should be tempered with a look at the articular cartilage if this is damaged or the lesion is large.	0.9590318307694318
Limited femoral resurfacing can be used for hips that do not have acetabular involvement.	0.9620259520763089
If there is acetabular involvement, total hip replacement remains the treatment of choice.	1.0733468637395762
Guillain Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the peripheral nerve system.	1.1525705877881107
Clinical hallmarks are symmetric muscle paralysis, areflexia and pronouced autonomic disturbances.	0.6415781108768958
Respiratory failure and cardiovascular instability are the main reasons for intensive care support in patients with GBS.	1.0404347293494984

The immunocytological detection of disseminated epithelial cells in bone marrow in patients with breast cancer has been performed at many hospitals and institutes since the early 1980s.	1.0273474676102514
Despite numerous publications in this field, it has not been possible to standardize the method and  establish the ideal antibody, either nationally or internationally.	1.128845629620262
Molecular biological methods using PCR technology could extend the diagnostic spectrum.	0.8707277311753296
However, one of the major problems in breast cancer is the lack of a disease-specific marker gene.	1.3537166940768885
As a result, immunocytology is still the standard procedure for tumour cell detection.	0.9635542192591617
Objective: We report our initial experience with an improved model of the laryngeal mask airway, the intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA, commercial name Fastrach), which was designed by A.I.J.	1.2576817293162368

For several years it has been argued that a chest tube should be placed at the scene of an accident if thoracic trauma is suspected.	1.0382638484550086
However, during emergency treatment in hospital it has been observed that a high number of such tubes have been placed incorrectly.	1.4132658620453358
To validate this impression, we conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical course of 33 trauma victims who had had chest tubes placed at the scene of accident.	1.1789317360378422
It was found that 39.4% of the chest tubes were placed completey incorrectly and 21.2% required some correction; 39.4% were placed correctly.	1.2293672070852986
In two cases (6.1%) life-threatening complications developed because of the chest tube, necessitating a thoracotomy in 1 patient and repeated pericardial punction in the other.	1.240677894254872
Based on the results of our study we believe that a more critical attitude should be adopted to the placement of chest tubes at the scene of the accident.	1.1707985442728128
Based upon the observation that some current approaches of quality assurance do not really come up to the specific characteristics of different psychotherapeutic settings, this article discusses quality assurance from the perspective of inpatient group psychotherapy.	1.082116154280923
It differentiates issues of structural quality (e.g.	0.5038198910983062
the importance of the institutional frame, rules for indication, or treatment concepts), process quality with special consideration of problems connected with short term group treatment, and outcome quality, which in order to be assured needs the development of methods which reflect the group setting adequately.	1.305445690443096

In Germany there is still an urgent need for action in regard to screening for breast cancer.	0.9551325925761609
The announcement of research projects for mammography screening proves this.	0.729264329127339
The following reports the results of the Munich field study.	0.8566849350195632
In 2 years, 2489 breast cancer cases were registered (status 6/98).	0.8151750852595736
Screening data were available for 1319 patients.	0.6923721353011758
The reduction in mortality, found in randomized studies, due to mammography in women over 50 years old was confirmed.	0.982789907833769
A relative reduction of 44.8% in 10-year mortality could be estimated through mammography and 25.1% through palpation, in comparison with "doing nothing".	1.2686105881863075
We could also estimate the participation of screening and the used methods in the Munich region.	1.0009307925951485
If the mammographies carried out today were used at 2-year intervals for women aged between 50 and 70 years, then the mammography screening could be performed with no additional costs for 70% of the women.	1.2320510729771197
The known facts regarding the population-based mortality and regarding the acceptance of the palpation screening and frequency of mammography are additional aspects for inclusion in the discussion of what research projects in Germany are and what they should fulfill.	0.9912124219489562
Insufficiency after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is a typical complication.	0.8167796834343026
Between 1 January 1992 and 31 December 1997 a total of 604 operations at the ACL were performed in the traumatology department of Nuremberg hospital.	1.042222828614093
During the same period 48 "transplant failures" were treated.	1.0990462127498366
There were various reasons for the failure of the transplant, some of them technical, occurring during the operation or during aftercare.	1.0763279595259267
Another reason for a re-rupture of the transplant was by trauma.The different reasons for the failure of the transplant were analysed in our patient population.	1.0620962998413885
The 48 patients were classified into five groups depending on the primary operation and the means of treatment (I = ACL sutures, II = artificial ligament, III = semitendinosus tendon, IV and V = ipsi- or contralateral bone-patellar-bone graft harvest after ACL reconstruction), so that the different ways of treatment were better comparable.	1.1854866317703172
Of the 48 patients 36 were followed up over an average of 2 1/2 years using the Lysholm scores and the OAK scores.	1.1324265251956278
The total score of the 36 patients was 81 points and can be valued as good using the evaluation scale of Lysholm and Gillquist.	0.9421622854529503
Using the OAK score we found an average of 71 to 81 points in the different groups; results in the group with the ipsilateral bone-tendon-bone graft harvest after ACL reconstruction were the worst.	1.08055469674717
The totalscore using the OAK score was 74 points and was considered "moderate".	0.7808103153304822
The score results were discussed and compared with the current literature.	0.8778025552907717
In this case report, we focus on the importance of scurvy as a differential diagnosis in a newborn presenting with swollen legs.	0.9928065867872526
Scurvy is rare in highly developed countries and often overlooked.	0.8979885994558903
Medical history, clinical symptoms and radiological findings are crucial for diagnosis.	1.0467857691935794
The diagnosis is confirmed by successful treatment with ascorbic acid.	0.9670854150873278
Hemangiomas of the skull base are rare neoplasms and are easily misdiagnosed as acoustic neuromas when occurring in the internal auditory canal.	1.0148305694038768
Among these tumors, ossifying hemangiomas are characterized histologically be newly formed bone tissue within their substance.	0.749728669973257
We describe a 26-year old female patient who presented with left-sided sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus.	1.1152460485616444
T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a bright space-occupying lesion of the internal auditory canal with extension to the geniculate ganglion.	0.9833388347373295
Bony erosions of the internal auditory canal were proved by high-resolution computed tomography.	0.9428478379439191
A hemangioma was suspected preoperatively and was resected via a middle cranial fossa approach.	0.8737333002242863
Histologically, new bone formations were found in a cavernous hemangioma.	1.348097543950703
In general, radiologic findings can suggest a hemangioma of the internal auditory canal and help to differentiate it from acoustic neuroma.	0.9487361056721842
Based on the histological findings of intratumoral bone formation, the hemangioma in our patient was classified as an ossifying hemangioma.	1.1127969748953097
However, reactive bone formation at the borders of a tumor in the internal auditory canal can also be mistaken as new intratumoral bone formation.	1.1375374799547668
Myocardial ischemia results in myocardial dysfunction.	0.6739754869298807
Recovery may be delayed ("stunning"), or persistent if perfusion remains reduced ("hibernation") and ischemia may go on to necrosis, thus, contributing to chronic heart failure.	1.2767719755573135
In addition, myocardium not directly affected by ischemia may undergo adaptive processes like hypertrophy and dilatation, which may result in chronic left heart failure.	1.143239430794628
This process is characterized by hemodynamic, neurohumoral, and progressive morphologic changes of the heart which are closely interrelated.	1.1027999040478351
Hemodynamic changes basically consist of an increase in left ventricular filling pressure and a decrease in global ejection fraction, and, in most cases years after myocardial infarction, in an increase in systemic vascular resistance and right atrial pressure.	1.1623590781608013
Neurohumoral changes consist of an increase in plasma catecholamines, atrial natriuretic factor and vasopressin, and in an activation of the renin-angiotensin-system.	1.1176781467319634
Plasma endothelin-1 was recently reported to be increased in patients with heart failure, and prognosis was related to endothelin levels.	1.065656052122864
Diminished response of vessels to endothelium (EDRF/NO) dependent vasodilatation suggests impairment of vascular endothelium in heart failure.	0.9403440215249161
Local changes of cardiac neurohumoral systems could contribute to structural changes of the heart, e.g., systemic activation to hemodynamic changes.	1.0420456596791623
Structural changes of the heart are characterized by an increase in volume and thickness of surviving myocardium and an expansion of ischemic and necrotic myocardium.	1.0184520764266078
Molecular control of these processes which include various cell types, such as cardiomyocytes and cardiofibroblasts, are currently an issue of intense research and could result in specific therapeutic importance.	1.0544352899157352
Postoperative infection in the locomotor system may lead to malpractice suits.	0.5762203275742377
The aim of the study was to determine the success rate of these claims and the type of expert-confirmed medical negligence so that strategies for avoiding such negligence can be offered.	0.9453752288513142
A total of 261 decrees concerning suspected malpractice after postoperative infection in the locomotor system were retrospectively evaluated.	0.7987448100651823
Of these, 43.7 % claims were successful.	1.0681999352423355
The most frequent type of negligence was late diagnosis (34.2 %), followed by inconsistant treatment (27.2 %) and insufficient surgical revision (5.3 %).	1.1520923609730789
In 33.3 %, combined types of negligence were found.	1.1393274522207766
Most frequently, negligence was suspected after infection following hand surgery and internal fixation of long bones.	0.9402546595004008
The highest success rate of claims was seen after puncture of joints (69.2 %).	0.9060843650634267
Insufficient documentation was confirmed in 15.3 %.	0.7994671028484331
The majority of negligence resulted from diagnostic and therapeutic doubts, which could be avoided, e. g., by a clear definition of infection, consultation of a second opinion, a 2nd-look operation, undelayed and radical surgical revision, painstaking follow-up and disciplined documentation.	1.1836860249154197
Abstract   Patient satisfaction plays an increasing part in the analysis of the outcome of medical treatment.	1.2142218998588432
The aim of the study was to compare health-related quality of life in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm after endovascular or conventional surgery.	1.0855205349575985
A total of 40 patients were included (20 treated by endovascular and 20 by conventional surgery).	1.148875802629759
A questionnaire with 28 items similar to the SF-36 was answered during scheduled appointments.	0.9019197828147761
On the third postoperative day, the conventionally treated patients were more frequently confined to bed (80% vs. 32%) and complained of intervention-related pain (90% vs. 42%) and incisional pain (26% vs. 15%); 55% of the patients suffered from obstipation (vs. 5% of the endovascular group).	1.0660062339452392
Furthermore, the preoperative psychological stress seemed to be intensified.	1.0375097731607505
In comparable percentage, both the endovascular and conventionally treated patients were limited in social activities perioperatively.	1.0497648080034732
Sexual dysfunction was more frequent in the conventional group (33% vs. 13% three months postoperative).	1.0084665094713037
In addition, the conventionally treated patients were more limited in their physical activities (25% vs. 40%) and had more fear of ambulation (35% vs. 6%).	0.9093484975416314
The patients treated by an endovascular approach complained about frequent examinations (39% vs. 5%) that were often related to X-ray exposure (67% vs. 20%).	1.0519056636002169
All of the conventionally operated patients had a sense of improvement (vs. 89% of the endovascular group); nevertheless only 28% felt completely healthy, compared to 11% of the endovascular treated patients.	1.1530143961567372
Advantages of the endovascular treated patients were "short hospital stay", "decreased pain", "smaller scars", and a "shorter confinement to bed".	1.339628936593631
After intervention the conventionally treated patients were more limited in almost all quality-of-life aspects.	0.8489359581915729
After 3 months, differences between the groups decreased except for sexual dysfunction and limited physical activities.	0.9493132523372464
The patients treated by endovascular surgery complained more about frequent X-ray examinations than the conventionally treated group.	1.0008495319516135
In the majority of ventilated patients endotracheal intubation is required only for a short time period.	0.9985598986380294
However, about 20% of the patients require prolonged mechanical ventilation.	1.3916075427584502
Apart from dysfunction of the central nervous system with a reduced respiratory drive, the vast majority of patients being difficult to wean suffer from either an increased load or a decreased capacity of their respiratory muscles.	1.1083334183572784
Furthermore, beside compromised respiratory mechanics other causes of difficult weaning are, e.g., left heart failure, inadequate sedation, neuropsychiatric issues, malnutrition and aspiration.	1.0671144835481832
The mere application of a consistent weaning strategy (independent from its concrete content) leads to an improved success rate.	0.9455893275502052
In this article three essential aspects of a weaning strategy are dealt with: 1) The concept of interventions (in particular focusing on mechanical ventilation modes unloading respiratory muscles), 2) pathophysiologically based parameters to predict weaning success or failure and 3) organisation of the T-tube trials.	1.14805798526183
A new approach in weaning of long-term ventilated patients is non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NMV).	0.9519582264993033
Compared to invasive mechanical ventilation NMV aims at reducing weaning time, decreasing complication rate and improving prognosis.	0.8574054351554581
Finally, the last section addresses terminal weaning.	0.9755650594467902
The psychoanalytic cure is characterized by a basic antinomy of time and time-lessness.	0.9621697696288642
Freud based the daily psychoanalytic work on the order of the mechanic clock (the time of the machine) to regulate a relationship which is unique in our culture.	1.1342663543307916
The temporal order of the cure responds to the logic of the temporal path.	0.7813310762767293
On the opposite, in the world of the unconscious the familiar concepts of cause and effect as well as of before and after are abolished.	1.257817664559454
"Symmetrical madness" prevails (Matte Blanco).	0.6613712834037463
The temporal core of the analytic situation is bi-logical.	0.7964760828346487
This ambiguity is reflected in the technical principles.	0.727108949538257
Free association breaks through the logic of the temporal path, again and again.	0.8618063064557352
There are, however, different defence strategies defusing its unforeseeability.	1.0491774372955514
The tension between the time that determines the analytic setting and the timelessness of free association gets once again a process of temporal order going.	0.9242052001462517
Present social changes and in connection with them the changed time strategies endanger the temporal order of the analytic cure.	0.8583727121213343
Several historical reports focusing on the heredity of migraine, as well as recent studies on its epidemiology and molecular biology, have revealed evidence for a decisive role of genetic factors in the aetiopathogenesis of familial migraine.	1.0637182727238468
Indeed, family studies, segregation analyses and twin studies have shown that genetic factors play an important role in disposition towards migraine but could not explain the entire aetiopathogenesis.	0.9974162046481521
The influence of extragenetic factors, however, remains mostly unknown.	1.110774122485877
Recent linkage analyses have provided evidence for genetic heterogeneity.	0.7835158179573258
A locus for Familial Hemiplegic Migraine (FHM), the only known type of migraine that follows autosomal-dominant transmission, has been linked to chromosome 19p13 but genetic heterogeneity has also been shown, i. e. different types of migraine could be excluded from this locus.	1.0765759645589146
Further investigations should concentrate on identifying the FHM gene on chromosome 19p13, on linkage analyses with markers for different susceptibility genes, and on genomic analyses of highly informative pedigrees.	1.057361232299815
This would lead to further clues to the pathogenesis underlying migraine and, thus, to therapeutic developments.	1.250472407696223
Radiographic findings suggestive of osteopenia and osteoporosis are frequently encountered in daily medical practice and can result from a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from highly prevalent causes such as postmenopausal and involutional osteoporosis to very rare endocrinologic and hereditary or acquired disorders.	0.8814279080935676
As bone mass is lost, changes in the trabecular and cortical bone structure occur.	0.8708579582618043
The changes that are visible on conventional radiographs may give specific information on the etiology of the underlying disease.	1.0079391800109192
Even though conventional radiography is indispensable in the differential diagnosis of osteopenia and osteoporosis, visual assessment of bone mass and its changes is subjective and strongly depends on the radiographic technique.	1.0093820819497745
With radiogrammetry and radiographic absorptiometry two methods exist that rely on conventional radiography and allow for a quantification of bone mass.	0.853005603467119
This article describes the author's experience during the 1-year AGA Pittsburgh fellowship from 1 April 1996 to 31 March 1997.	0.9930651451369804
The article is focused on the work in the Musculoskeletal Research Center and the Center for Sports Medicine of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery in Pittsburgh.	0.9800636189627135
The author describes projects on the biomechanics of the cruciate ligaments, using robotic technology.	0.9272118059808863
Organizational and social aspects of the life in Pittsburgh are discussed.	0.9233013209112005
The different subgroups of hypercalciuria cannot be separated clearly by the Pak calcium-load test.	0.6549712264640303
To improve the diagnosis and therapy we examined all relevant parameters of calcium metabolism in 32 patients with calcium urolithiasis and hypercalciuria (> 6.25 mmol/day).	1.183322365186287
We also conducted bone mineral density measurements as well as the Pak calcium-load test.	0.9313901850164966
In most cases the pathophysiological constellations which Pak takes as the basis for his classification of hypercalciuria could not be shown.	1.1491425722800073
To date, diagnostics only insufficiently explains the genesis of hypercalciuria (except pHPT).	0.8158875316907575
As a consequence, a therapeutic problem arises: a low-calcium diet should not be generally recommended, since some patients may develop osteopenia.	1.1739571515220482
From our investigation the following diagnostic and therapeutic conclusions can be drawn: (1) Hypercalciuria in primary hyperparathyroidism should be treated by surgical removal of the adenoma.	1.092323386739482
(2) The parathormone-independent osteogenic form should be treated with thiazides.	1.0700862963379638
(3) Hypercalciuria with increased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D should be treated by low-calcium diet.	0.988719740442117
A 58-year old man with wilson's disease sustained a bilateral spontaneous rupture of the quadriceps tendon.	1.0024390372541467
The histological investigation showed advanced degeneration of tendon structure and cupper deposits.	0.7820520455646043
After tenosuture the patient had complete cure with full range of movement.	0.9830574310285982
We discuss about relation of wilson x s disease, cupper deposits and degenerative changes of tendon tissue.	0.8452312421919863
Within the framework of the National Health Interview and Examination Survey 1998 the Short Form Questionnaire SF-36 has been applied to measure the health related quality of life (HRQOL).	0.9453325328583193
This opened more opportunities than simply creating a new normative sample for the German adult population.	0.8666495624216092
Thus, the very complex interdependence between morbidity, satisfaction, risk factors, health related behaviours, social status, age and sex on the one side and the subjective assessment of health related quality of life on the other hand may be investigated.	1.1626115010710474
First results of the Survey data are presented which open the discussion of the possibilities and limits of the SF-36 instrument for measuring health related quality of life at the population level.	1.0738053735234445
The von Willebrand's Disease affects about 1-3 % of the population and it is undiagnosed in most people.	1.1835423924321629
Originally described by the Finish physician Erik von Willebrand in 1926 this disorder is associated with mucous membran bleeding including epistaxis, hypermenorhoea and excessive bleeding from surgery and dental procedures.	0.8684071818761551
In von Willebrands disease the patients have a quantitative or qualitative abnormality in the von Willebrand Factor (vWF) which has two major functions: it serves by bridging between platelets and injury site in the blood vessel wall, and it circulates as a complex with factor VIII, protecting it from rapid degradation.	1.1728561558621218
More than 20 different types and subtypes of vWD have been described but almost all patients can be classified as having 1 of the 2 most common types of vWD.	1.1394401206079885
About 70 % of patients have type 1 and about 10-20 % present themself with type 2A and 2B vWD type 3 in about 10 %.	1.1021025028177471
By taking a clinical history of bleeding it is important to think about vWD and to make the appropriate diagnosis.	1.0858321974390448
If the vWD is suspected diagnostic tests should include an activated partial thromboplastin time, bleeding time, factor VIII:C, Ristocetin cofactor, and vWF antigen.	0.9253751527396147
Additional testing of ristocetin induced plattlet adhesion (RIPA), the multimeric structure and collagen binding test and gen-analysis allow diagnosing the different types of v. Willebrand Disease.	0.9411749571627105
The treatment of choice in mild forms is the synthetic agent desmopressin.	1.0546814260926909
In patients with severe type 1, type 2B, 2N and type 3 or in people who do not response to desmopressin, the appropriate treatment is a factor VIII concentrate that is rich of vWF.	1.1552995707863132
Until now no recommendations in the orthopaedic literature have been found regarding diagnosis and treatment of vWS patients.	0.9395855956952557
Based on the experience with 43 orthopaedic patients presenting vWD over the last 15 years a contemporary guideline for the successful perioperative management of vWD in orthopaedic surgery is presented.	1.0071784885544797
In a close collaboration between the orthopaedic surgeon and the specialized haemostaseologist every invasive procedure in patients with vWD can be undertaken without the risk of excessive bleeding.	0.9339795461897672
Patients with a prior myocardial infarction (MI) have a high risk of perioperative reinfarction compared with the normal population (5%-8% vs. 0.1%-0.7%) [10].	1.383663092304345
According to Rao [13], a reduction of this risk is possible when patients are monitored invasively and all haemodynamic parameters are kept within the physiological range.	1.0584783531080395
In most institutions it is not feasible to treat patients as Rao recommended: this would overstrain both hospital structure and financial resources.	1.1144216224367671
We studied the incidence of perioperative MI and other cardiac events in patients with prior MI.	1.0361043875363984
During the study period the anaesthesia and intensive care methods of our institution were neither changed nor influenced.	0.8826525719079924
In addition to this clinical evaluation, we performed perioperative Holter electrocardiographic monitoring and measured serum levels of the recently introduced marker troponin T (parts II and III).	1.08240856277653
Small basal cell carcinomas of the trunk are usually regarded as relatively harmless.	0.9552672560832406
In contrast, large and ulcerating basal cell carcinomas may become a therapeutic challenge with a less favourable prognosis and high risk of recurrence.	1.1865885880140938
The development of mutilating giant basal cell carcinomas appears less due to the biological aggressive character of the tumors, but rather to the patients' attitude of neglect.	1.104724877451131
The case of a 62-year-old patient, featuring such attitude, demonstrates how a common basal cell carcinoma of the trunk can grow over a period of years to a troublesome ulcerating tumor.	1.0036332709213571
This epidemiologic, retrospective follow-up mortality study is based on the data gathered in the department of forensic medicine at the University Hospital of Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt/Main.	1.0470233765406753
