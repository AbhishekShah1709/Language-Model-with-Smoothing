The recently published conjecture that such lesions of the retroperitoneum represent a separate entity with features of a malignant neoplasm is discussed.	0.6251765248736568
An example of a plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumour (PFT) is presented for the first time in the German-language literature.	0.8492645635777659
The diagnostic criteria for this rare soft-tissue neoplasm of childhood and young adulthood, which is mostly subcutaneous in location and has a tendency to recur, include the plexiform structure which gives it its name, extensive siderin deposits and numerous osteoclast-like giant cells.	0.6179606820931992
The development of the tumour described here, which occurred in the field of radiation of a malignant haemangiopericytoma excised 7 years previously, indicates the possibility of induction of PFT by radiation.	0.7251752451477338
The current increase in the cost of health care must be considered as a severe threat to the prehospital emergency services system.	0.7242026572043577
Two examples have been selected - the patient with polytrauma and the patient in cardiac arrest - to demonstrate the dilemma between a need for objective data and the requirements of emergency patients.	0.9954685006107953
Study results obtained in trauma patients indicating that total prehospital time, including scene time, is correlated to patient outcome have led to the conclusion that at the scene treatment by emergency physicians may be dispensable.	0.7175039256703378
It has, however also been demonstrated that the time required for medical treatment at the scene is equivalent to 20% of the total scene time, thus representing only a fraction of the total prehospital time.	0.8433412004344909
Correlating the total prehospital time or scene time to outcome therefore appears absurd.	0.35371029105601354
The treatment principle of aggressive shock treatment in polytrauma needs critical reevaluation on the basis of results obtained by recent preclinical studies in patients with penetrating torso injuries.	0.5312593008385806
Small volume resuscitation could not be demonstrated to improve outcome in polytrauma patients, although a slight improvement in patients with brain injury may be assumed.	0.7218716201284189
Endotracheal intubation and early artificial ventilation are proven therapeutic principles in polytraumatized patients.	0.4097314078711239
Unfortunately, for ethical reasons randomised carefully controlled comparative studies can not be performed in polytrauma patients unless the patient is fully conscious.	0.7228278166362577
The importance of endotracheal intubation and artificial ventilation in unconscious trauma patients becomes apparent under conditions of anaesthesia where the application of the endotracheal tube averts regurgitation, aspiration and concomitant morbidity and mortality.	0.5443481404722847
The common causes of cardiovascular collapse and their pathomechanisms, as well as the mechanisms of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, have been widely investigated.	0.6365978742090641
Nevertheless, various aspects of their application are still controversial.	0.6556149832863857
The most recent study results have recommended initial ventilation prior to thoracic compression.	0.457973313218816
New methods of assisting mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation, such as ACD CPR or vest CPR, have shown promising results in animal experiments.	0.49921133473677154
However, the importance of results obtained by preclinical randomised controlled investigations in humans need to be confirmed by further studies as to outcome.	0.6537588069294185
The efficacy of defibrillation in cases of ventricular fibrillation has been clearly demonstrated, particularly with a view to the interval between ventricular fibrillation and defibrillation.	0.7299246411977125
It has further been demonstrated that basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation preserves ventricular fibrillation and thus improves the chance of survival.	0.4744234612788018
The present generation of defibrillators has been further improved, particularly by the introduction of biphasic defibrillator wave forms, which may reduce the required energy, as well as possible complications, while offering an increase in the efficacy of defibrillation and a reduction in defibrillator size.	0.7374648909788509
Scientific emergency medicine is responsible not only for the development and validation of new methods and concepts, but in particular for their application under quality control conditions.	0.7492594391669385
Politicians require an improvement in the quality of the validation of emergency measures, although the instruments available for the investigation of these measures are known to be obsolete (experimental models, experimental design).	0.6970488197898944
Additionally, the financial support of research in emergency medicine suffers from being accourded low priority by public research funds such as the German Research Fund.	0.5293314798710026
However, in view of the rapid application of experimental results to daily practice it should be emphasized that patients also support research in emergency medicine via their direct financial contributions to the health insurance companies.	0.5805614673151954
The prognosis in patients with gynecologic cancers depends not only on the stage but also on a wide spectrum of other findings.	0.546099029477158
Cross-sectional imaging modalities, including sonography, CT and MRI, have increasingly been used for optimal treatment planning in gynecologic cancers.	0.8005507351823723
Their staging criteria are based on the well-established FIGO staging system.	0.618247844141048
CT and MRI compete with sonography, which plays a pivotal role in the evaluation of the female pelvis.	0.6752169368818729
This paper reviews the role of sonography, CT and MRI in the staging of gynecologic malignancies.	0.6420642960307376
It puts the emphasis on MRI, which has been established as imaging modality of choice in the preoperative evaluation of cervical and endometrial cancer, and which seems slightly superior to CT in the staging of ovarian cancer.	0.7626371652970152
Extraabdominal desmoids represent one group of deep fibromatoses.	0.2801978279271938
These aggressive nonmetastasizing tumorlike lesions have a strong tendency to local infiltration, with a recurrence rate of about 40 %.	0.6415826515292697
Trauma, hormones and heredity have been implicated as etiologic factors.	0.37287412974728384
Shoulder, chest wall, back and thigh are favored sites.	0.44078706942944157
By combination of different diagnostic procedures the number of differential diagnoses can be reduced to only a few.	0.6802584632940996
While in former times surgery was thought to be the only kind of therapy, nowadays adjuvant procedures like radiation, hormonal therapy and also chemotherapy are becoming more and more important.	0.6270179757300994
Amputation or other mutilating procedures should be done only if the tumor recurs repeatedly.	0.570612106078017
Katayama syndrome is an allergic reaction of antigens of schistosomes, known as the acute phase of schistosomiasis.	0.5950338552949093
We report on an eleven year-old boy, who was seen at our outpatient department because of cough and oedema of the face after travelling to Malawi.	0.7163130356176073
Remarkable findings were an eosinophilia and antibodies against schistosoma-antigens.	0.3077667312829984
Six weeks later the diagnosis was confirmed by detecting eggs of Schistosoma haematobium in the urine.	0.5173370295142704

There is still a significant lack of treatment and rehabilitation facilities for chronic pain patients in Germany today.	0.8666080834501186
Most of all the treatment of low back pain and widespread pain syndromes or panalgesia is time consuming and complicated.	0.6835476159022629
The main problem of anaesthesiological pain clinics is the increase of these complex pain syndromes in the last years.	0.7034729138185609
The definition of chronic pain is a contiuous noxious input modulated and compounded by the prolonged or recurrent nature of chronic state and further complicated by a multitude of economic and psychosocial factors.	0.528870586838581
It is now clear that no one discipline or mode will suffice.	0.39867188185964664
Only a multidisciplinary and intensive approache will prevail, as discussed in this article.	0.6602006493035871
Unfortunately these multidisciplinary pain units are nearly not existing in Gemany just as little as control of the effectiveness of pain treatment.	0.4246824310786368
The use of somato-sensory evoked potentials (SEP) in supraaortal reconstructions has been well accepted.	0.5067386330333798
However, reports about incidence and clinical significance of ischaemic SEP alterations differ widely.	0.5268874718196379
In a prospective study we registered SEP alterations during 482 operations done on 419 patients between 1 July 1994, and 31 December 1996.	0.6512680409088616
Incidence, risk factors and clinical relevance were investigated.	0.6438812360012146
In only 1.7% of cases SEP examination was inadequate.	0.8075564057333622
During 406 operations SEP were altered minimally or not at all.	0.20425599087229138
Significant changes were dedected during 65 interventions (13.5%).	0.42384805374625784
The clinical outcome was poor when alteration was found during carotid dissection (five events, three deficits).	0.6045301633345243
Cross-clamping ischaemia was the common reason for alterations (81.5%); they were generally reversible after shunting and without clinical significance.	0.5817641972380334
As risk factor for cross-clamping ischaemia, only contralateral carotid occlusion was identified.	0.6105324766365464
Tyrosine-rich crystalloids in tumors of the salivary glands are rare and have been reported mainly in specimens from Black African patients.	0.6166075765936054
The pathogenesis of these structures is still unclear, but pathological secretion by neoplastic myoepithelial cells is supposed.	0.5849626713056117
Millon's staining and ultrastructural examinations are used for confirming the diagnosis.	0.38355268295732914
We present the case report of a 59-year-old woman with a myoepithelioma of the minor salivary glands in the smooth palate containing tyrosine-rich crystalloids as an example of this rare phenomenon.	0.6567844508574607
Pseudoarthrosis and cubitus valgus as main complications following displaced fractures of the radial condyle in children can be prevented by open reduction and fixation by K wires.	0.5505756053989406
However, delayed union and stimulation of the radial physis with condylar overgrowth and varisation of the elbow as well as fishtail deformities of the distal end of the humerus are reported nevertheless.	0.6952221082789815
To prevent those growth disturbances all primary and secondary (4-day X-ray control) displaced fractures of the radial condyle, i. e. those with a central gap of more than 2 mm, were prospectively treated by open reduction and osteosynthesis with a metaphyseal lag screw beginning 1974.	0.7061855601525373
Sixty-six patients (41 boys, 25 girls) with an average follow-up of 10 years (2-22 years) sustained 28 primary and 6 secondary displaced fractures.	0.8715647466168596
In 5 cases a K wire fixation was performed in view of the smallness of the fragment.	0.6544399151344804
Two children with conservative treatment following overlooked displaced fractures showed condylar overgrowth and varisation of the elbow.	0.3948559713471007
Screw osteosynthesis led to symmetric elbow angles and function in all cases, whereas fishtail deformities could be observed in 8 of 27 children, probably as a consequence of the remaining central fracture instability.	0.7355401020093336
Conclusion: Open reduction and osteosynthesis with a metaphyseal lag screw prevents condylar overgrowth in displaced fractures of the radial condyle by guaranteeing fracture healing in anatomic position within 3-4 weeks.	0.5217957781589384
However, fishtail deformity can not be prevented by metaphyseal compression only.	0.4546139379508237
A commercially available C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) concentrate was used for short-term prophylaxis before surgery in two patients with hereditary angioneurotic oedema.	0.6485736406444217
The patients suffered from recurrent subcutaneous and submucosal oedema of the face, extremities, and gastrointestinal tract as the result of a hereditary C1-INH deficiency.	0.610492447689463
Both patients were receiving tranexamic acid or danazol therapy as oral long-term prophylaxis.	0.4471706385871348
Over the years the patients underwent several operations in regional and general anaesthesia, with mask ventilation or intubation.	0.6134378430616676
The C1-INH plasma concentrations measured preoperatively were always very low (0.02-0.06 g/l, normal range 0.15-0.35 g/l), despite the oral long-term prophylaxis.	0.6479746661096618
Substitution treatment with 500-1000 U C1-INH was performed 1 h before surgery.	0.4507142826229864
No side effects were seen following the concentrate infusions.	0.536957462630598
With this substitution treatment no specific symptoms of hereditary angioneurotic oedema were recognized in either case.	0.3838371467608617
The measurement of C1-INH plasma concentration 2 h or 4 h after C1-INH substitution showed a marked rise in both patients, though normal values were not reached in either.	0.5831332506379954
We suggest that infusion of C1 concentrate is an appropriate form of preoperative substitution treatment in patients with hereditary angioneurotic oedema, in view of the lower risk of infection than with infusion of fresh-frozen plasma and the observed effectiveness.	0.6483402269556752
This case report describes a 62 years old patient who suffered from therapy resisten atrial fibrillation for 12 years.	0.6674069451426904
She underwent "Cox/Maze-III-Procedure" during a mitral valve reconstruction and a stable sinus rhythm was achieved.	0.5466049381001853
Two years after operation she has been in a stable sinus rhythm.	0.5708446382125093
Transesophageal echocardiography revealed normal cardiac dimensions and function with coordinated atrioventricular contractility.	0.30511970719606574
Therefore the therapy with anticoagulants and antiarrhythmics could be discontinued.	0.4157897102760037
Two cases of congenital wandering spleen with typical clinical course are reported:  An 11-year old girl had a two month history of intermittent abdominal pain predominantly after physical stress.	0.6643165444741985
In upright position a palpable resistance could be identified as wandering spleen by ultrasound and scintiscan, and in this case splenopexy was performed.	0.740382683886007
An otherwise healthy 3-year old girl suffered from acute abdomen caused by torsion of an upside- down spleen with partial infarction.	0.5951041549778033
Diagnosis was made based on ultrasound and CT-Scan.	0.603421242645723
The extent of infarction could be evaluated by color flow sonography.	0.5780673439990341
After partial resection splenopexy in orthotopic position was performed.	0.2533235444156741
Discussion: In situations of intermittent abdominal pain as well as acute abdomen torsion of wandering spleen should be taken into consideration.	0.506224359703688
Monodisciplinary orthopaedic pain therapy no longer measures up to international standards.	0.30365452296174716
In cases of chronic back pain, in particular, there is such a gulf between the clinical findings and the patient's subjective assessment that the symptoms cannot be attributed solely to so-called degenerative changes.	0.788551397817661
Back pain patients are in great danger of becoming fixated on somatic symptoms due to an excess of diagnostic procedures or incorrect diagnoses, of being treated purely somatically on the basis of associated findings, and of suffering irreversible damage from invasive management of such findings.	0.6279460690336444
Despite the wealth of empirical evidence, it remains difficult to expand the everyday concept of illness and its causes to include not only physical and biological factors but also social and emotional disturbances.	0.562195201369147
Particularly physicians with a purely biological concept of pain have not learned to take note of affective relational factors and incorporate them into their diagnostic assessment.	0.37140019421818526
The decision to undertake invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedures then frequently represents the doctor's reaction to feelings of irritation or helplessness.	0.4716328695738764
If this situation is to change, an interdisciplinary concept of pain must be made a part of medical training, and scientific findings must be presented in such a way that they can be integrated into routine daily practice.	0.6529089386074594
The laboratory surveillance of measles in Germany contributes to an objective estimation of the situation.	0.4733346813178028
Compared to data of the pre-vaccination era, the incidence of measles has been reduced, while a shift in age towards the group of 15-year-olds is observed.	0.7416650611441523
Germany will have considerable difficulties to reach the aim of eradicating measles in the European region by the year 2007.	0.5420792521052087
Apart from the fact that systematic surveillance is lacking, the immunity gaps in small children represent a particularly weak spot.	0.4695692563022848
In order to effectively control measles, high vaccination rates of at least 90% are necessary by the end of the second year of life.	0.7378478385817878
In addition, laboratory surveillance has to be included to measure successful vaccination.	0.6228870074523647
Main focusses are the laboratory confirmation of suspected measles cases, seroprevalence studies of population immunity as well as the control of the circulation of measles viruses.	0.5846079096158763
The Working Group Measles ("Arbeitsgemeinschaft Masern" - AGM) as well as the amended law on infection prevention are important instruments to make measurable progress towards measles eradication also in Germany.	0.6164838960024002
We report on the activities of the National Reference Centre for Measles, Mumps and Rubella since 1991.	0.617371880169667
The German data are compared to those of selected other European countries.	0.55048203615764
The different methods that are available for the assessment and quantification of "brittle nails" and for the evaluation of various therapeutical approaches are compared.	0.9183162323483613
At this time, measurement of the swelling properties is the best documented and most reliable method for studying the treatment of brittle nails.	0.6214068728105548
Reliable qualitative data can also be obtained by scanning electron microscopy.	0.5018693078918284
Measurement of the transonychial water loss and assessment of thickness and density of nails by ultrasound have also been used successfully, but the methodology still has to be improved and the reproducibility, confirmed.	0.6789747641867429
The case of a closed elbow dislocation with complete rupture of the brachial artery and its veins is described.	0.6314432757409536
This combination of injuries is rather rare and only 25 cases were found in the literature.	0.6122623308173285
The sharp lesion of the vessels was remarkable, probably due to the edge of the distally ruptured capsule.	0.5293671246576268
Immediate revision with suture of the vessels and an immobilization for three weeks gave a good result.	0.462993081170348
The management of multiple trauma patients has improved recently.	0.47684592290340494
Surgeons' education, preclinical rescue structures, initial clinical survey and therapeutic strategies, as well as diagnostic imaging, have progressed.	0.6174966465846747
Plain film imaging is increasingly being abandoned in favor of CT. Fast imaging techniques (spiral CT) have led to the inclusion of CT in the primary survey.	0.6994125500333569
To minimize the risk to the patient during prolonged diagnostic time, algorithms have to be defined concerning structures, emergency room equipment and quality.	0.6883493419660633
Basics, state of the art and suggestions concerning management of multiple trauma patients are presented and discussed from the radiologist's point of view.	0.5788317608986474
The importance of hepatitis C virus infection has been recently noted in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or dilated cardiomyopathy.	0.5326257670576552
In a collaborative research project of the Committees for the Study of Idiopathic Cardiomyopathy, hepatitis C virus antibody was found in 74 of 697 patients (10.65) with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and in 42 of 663 patients (6.3%) with dilated cardiomyopathy; these prevalences were significantly higher than that found in volunteer blood donors in Japan.	0.7449909697829922
Hepatitis C virus antibody was detected in 650 of 11,967 patients (5.4%) seeking care in 5 academic hospitals.	0.6277877167105854
Various cardiac abnormalities were found, and arrhythmias were the most frequent.	0.6744981754969885
These observations suggest that hepatitis C virus infection is an important cause of a variety of otherwise unexplained heart diseases.	0.5835026291131375
Transdifferentiated retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) display enhanced contractile potentials and have been implicated in the development of tractional retinal detachment.	0.4855970126195911
This study determines the activity of contraction-promoting factors, examines some involved mechanisms and evaluates inhibitors.	0.36883576581890787
Using an in vitro contractionassay, we demonstrated that collagen matrix contraction by transdifferentiated RPE cells is effectively stimulated by serum, platelet-derived growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-1.	0.6003724539844356
Endothelin-1 and transforming growth factor-1 and -2 have a more discrete or marginal effect.	0.900804937977559
Tractional forces promoted by these peptides are completely protein synthesis dependent.	0.27196188219199896
Contraction stimulated by serum is only partly dependent on de novo protein synthesis, suggesting different active factors and/or pathways.	0.4619622015998049
Staurosporine, a broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor, effectively inhibited collagen matrix contraction by transdifferentiated RPE cells regardless of the promoter.	0.4422824988518641
Revascularization in cases of recurrent occlusions following aorto-iliac vascular reconstructions, particular in high-risk patients, poses a therapeutic dilemma.	0.5061292892664666
We report the case of a 78-year-old female patient who presented - after multiple vascular reconstructions of iliac and femoral arteries - with Leriche syndrome, resulting critical limb ischemia and concomitant coronary and lung disease.	0.6679147995516681
Due to the high surgical and anesthetic risk we implanted an axillo-bifemoral PTFE graft.	0.5173610799671969
The preoperative angiography of the supraaortic branches revealed a high-grade stenosis of the right subclavian artery in the presence of a previously implanted carotid-subclavian bypass on the left.	0.7102892542057325
This stenosis was dilated and then stented by way of the proximal end of the axillo-bifemoral graft, which in turn was distally anastomosed to the right popliteal and left deep femoral artery.	0.589419105054085
Postoperative angiography verified a good run-off and satisfactory vascular status was obtained.	0.3893001160082331
Duplex sonography 6 months after surgery showed a good flow and the patient was free of symptoms.	0.8740008863331413
These results demonstrate that, combined with intraoperative stent application, an axillo-bifemoral graft can be implanted with good results.	0.6534404623761497
Objective: Concerning the long-term somatic development of children born with very low birth weight and/or born very premature, there are varying and sometimes contradictory statements.	0.5279958952505887
A follow-up study was carried out on premature-born children from Thuringia and Saxonia at pre-school and early school age in order to investigate the long-term somatic development of these children.	0.5528101897254655
Anthropological parameters were examined and compared with the data of a reference group.	0.8178367284753695
Mediastinitis caused by infection with Clostridium perfringens and spontaneous rupture of the esophagus are both life threatening conditions.	0.5040333543410006
The combination of these two entities led to septic multiorgan failure in a 38-year-old woman.	0.5866733614443803
The patient was treated successfully by esophagectomy and postoperative lavage through a partially open abdomen.	0.6108576958707728
The lack of information regarding emesis, the leading symptom of Boerhaave's syndrome, caused delayed diagnosis: the triad of emesis, severe epigastric pain and emphysema of the skin was not established until 30 h after the onset of symptoms.	0.6914385115576525
For ethical and socio-economical reasons (cost-explosion in transfusion-medicine, patient's individual destiny), devepolment and consistent application of allogeneic transfusion sparing techniques in surgery is a chal- lenge to anesthesiologists, surgeons and blood-bankers.	0.4893563707054188
The combination of different techniques, i.e.	0.4238899059971761
autologous predonation, hemodilution, choice of anesthetic regimen, deliberate hypotension, application of anti-fibrinolytic agents and autotransfusion of intraoperatively saved blood allow for avoidance of allogeneic blood transfusion even in patients presenting important intraoperative hemorrhage.	0.4569273602300394
Introduction: If the surgeon cannot find the tendon of the superior oblique muscle in the right place, he has to change his operative plans intraoperatively.	0.6260010191836896
Different procedures are recommended: reinsertion of the superior oblique in the right place, recession of the inferior oblique muscle, and operations on the vertical muscles of the same or the yoke eye.	0.6626138969618512
No quantitative recommendations on the surgical amount are mentioned in the literature.	0.37268669990605996
In 180 children (87 children belonging to a control group, 68 with fever of non-renal origin, and 25 with pyelonephritis) albumin and immunoglobulin G (markers for glomerular dysfunction), -1-microglobulin and  -NAG (markers for proximal tubular dysfunction) and apolipoprotein A1 (marker of 'postrenal' dysfunction) were measured in second-voided morning urine.	0.6757917124991838
In children with fever of non-renal origin, glomerular dysfunction was encountered in 8.8 %, tubular dysfunction in 17.6 % and mixed glomerular-tubular dysfunction in 14.7 % of cases.	0.7498831584440682
Among children with pyelonephritis, 28 % revealed glomerular dysfunction and 44 % mixed glomerular-tubular dysfunction.	0.5854719658429964
No case of solitary proximal tubular dysfunction was observed in children with pyelonephritis.	0.8300810687412042
There were highly significant differences in presence and expression of glomerular dysfunction between children with fever of non-renal origin and children with pyelonephritis (P < 0.0001), whereas with regard to proximal tubular dysfunction, the differences were only moderately significant ( -NAG: P < 0.01) or of low significance (-1-microglobulin: P < 0.05).	0.7049962217907462
This may indicate that morphologic changes occur during interstitial pyelonephritis due to inflammation of glomeruli, resulting in glomerular dysfunction, while proximal tubular dysfunction may additionally be due to fever-associated function processes.	0.4794725126524366
Up to the middle of the 1970s, chemotherapy had only a marginal role in the overall treatment concept for cervical carcinoma, and surgery and radiotherapy are still the cornerstones of treatment today.	0.7360778478863516

We compared a cw carbon dioxide flash-scanning laser system to an Er:YAG laser in laser skin resurfacing of facial rhytides.	0.3982574066753339
In all patients, CO2 laser treatment showed a better cosmetic result whereas erythema and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation were less marked in Er:YAG laser therapy.	0.44796164254546206
A separation of the individual latex layers is a known complication of endotracheal armoured tubes manufactured by immersion technique.	0.4915835458716578
This can result in herniation into the lumen with obstruction of the tube.	0.4835578810048205
Diffusion of nitrous oxide into the inner hernia considerably intensifies the obstruction.	0.2729813229843992
This can lead to life-threatening situations.	0.6146878108754056
We observed a similar herniation caused by layer separation with subsequent tube obstruction of silicolatex anaesthesia tubes used in paediatric circuit systems.	0.3949086234510245
This is caused by manufacturing defects and above all by damage incurred in reprocessing.	0.3550741991587912
Therefore it is important to process the tubes carefully.	0.476987189428635
A too-high drying temperature can cause premature layer separation.	0.26803643075024675
The tubes should never be processed more than 80 times.	0.4007673099169285
Routine examination of the tubes is imperative, especially at the predilection sites for layer separation.	0.5857495887686899
Severe aortic valve disease is a rare complication of coarctation in adults.	0.8995751680589138
Between 1961 and 1990 aortic valve replacement was performed after or combined with the operation of coarctation in 24 adults (4% of entire population operated for coarctation).	0.6963712062735471
Bicuspid aortic valves were present in 2/3 of patients.	0.5320186387565343
In 10 patients (710 with aortic stenosis) coarctation was operated early (mean age 24 years) and aortic valve late (mean age 40 years): in 14 (1014 with aortic regurgitation, mean age 40 years) aortic valve and coarctation were operated simultaneously (8 patients) or staged within 6 months (6 patients).	0.8167826324955552
Additional surgical interventions on the dilated aorta ascendens were performed in 8, mitral valve replacement in 2 and aorto-coronary bypass in 1 patients.	0.5155555583023306
Early mortality was 224 (8%) and was similar in simultaneously (18) and staged (114) operated cases: 10 year survival was lower than in an age-matched group of 72 patients with aortic valve disease of similar severity operated during the same period (70% vs 88%, p < 0.01): 67 late deaths were cardia; 55 pts with preoperatively severely increased end-diastolic (> 199 mlm2) and 44 with end-systolic (> 90 mlm2) left ventricular volumes and 22 with ejection fraction < 41 % died late postoperatively.	0.7516235217110232
Abstract  13 experienced addiction therapists provid-ed information about trauma experiences and comorbidity of 122 clients (26 women and 96 men) with opiate addiction and multiple substance abuse.	0.47944343557452285
42% had had at least one traumatic life experience and the women had higher percentages than men.	0.6573913079537965

26% of the trauma victims were diagnosed as having post-traumatic stress disorder.	0.7142009011056576
In comparison with individuals without trauma experiences, victims evidenced significantly more comorbid symptoms, they more frequently suffered from polytoxicomania and had more experiences with psychotherapy.	0.5327030506024214
Nearly all drugs currently used during the course of general anaesthesia may lead to hypersensitivity reactions of various types.	0.548902917228698
There may be an acute type I allergic reactions or to a more or less severe pseudoallergic reactions, in rare cases with lethal outcome.	0.6583754499778556
Routine preoperative testing appears of little predictive value, in spite of the high frequency of so-called risk factors (atopy, other kind of allergy) among the evaluated group of patients.	0.6177226933201884
Careful allergological testing should be performed 4 to 6 weeks after any incidents of suspected drug intolerance, in order to discover the underlying causative agent.	0.5849348073953273
Skin testing is of diagnostic value for neuromuscular blockers and intravenous narcotics.	0.4630204803203025
RAST- and RIA-tests and/or mediator releasing tests may also used additionally.	0.49643695841274965
Together with all other administered drugs, all the routinely used neuromuscular blockers (suxamethonium, vecuronium, pancuronium, alcuronium, atracurium, mivacurium) should be tested, since they often represent the cause for such reactions.	0.5755505398230772
For other classes of drugs (for example, volatile anesthetics and opioids) the clinical relevance of skin testing still remains uncertain.	0.6787597285590374
For less severe incidents seen during general anaesthesia such as pruritus, or exanthems, skin testing seems to be less relevant.	0.5812261668891738

They learn by pain to avoid these situations in future.	0.40592887667994104
Shortly after major injury, there is a limited analgesic period allowing the body to flee the area of danger, later on, emerging pain compels the body to rest and supports recuperation.	0.5362391494758597
While acute pain has a certain meaning, chronic pain does not.	0.5848359105897989
It induces a comprehensive suffering including loss of initiative, appetite and vigilance.	0.3208568342155527
It reduces life-quality, often accompanied by depressive moods.	0.5493147178060145
Acute pain causes changes in the central nervous system leading to an increased sensitivity of nociception (hyperalgesia).	0.5270737913040183
During healing, the central processing of noxious stimuli is normalised taking minutes to weeks.	0.5090108781795097
Sometimes, unknown factors initiate chronification of pain.	0.20629673998349948
Changes on a molecular level in peripheral tissue as well as in the central nervous system induce "cellular early genes" [24], a synthesis of c-fos, c-jun and other proteins favouring the chronification of pain.	0.6533368276278537
All efforts have to be made to depress or interrupt such a development.	0.5220935368343939
One of the first steps to pain prophylaxis in a hospital is an optimal surgical technique: incision, extension, limited tissue damage and minimal invasive surgery should guarantee the smallest impairment of the nociceptive system possible.	0.6811555821768854
However, nociceptive input is intense and of long duration and leads to central sensibilisation.	0.4043572496281315
Postoperative pain has lost its function as surgery anticipates healing.	0.37742355480717626
Pain induces a reduction of ventilation, circulation, digestion and increases the risk of other disorders.	0.5132907873635719
There is need of aggressive pain treatment for humanitarian reasons and for reasons of late sequelae like permanent pain and increased reduction of function [10].	0.46921125606551656
This is of pivotal importance in patients with amputations or sympathetic reflex dystrophy (SRD).	0.41892036917608694
Antinociception is best provided by regional anaesthesia technique with a combination of local anaesthetics and opioids which results in better outcome [2, 12].	0.5744040891374668
Hence, regional anaesthesia techniques are strongly indicated in those patients.	0.5760054460605668

invasive procedures the current diagnostic measures will be explained.	0.4112842591203072
To the non-invasive measures do account the extensive patients history taking including the sexual history and the psychological diagnostics, the physical examination and laboratory screenings.	0.6339772927595159
The semi-invasive procedures include the intracavernous injection test with vasoactice substances, the doppler sonography and duplex or color duplex sonography, the corpus-cavernosum-electromyogram (CC-EMG) and other neurophysiological examinations.	0.6183316810947724
The third invasive step contains the dynamic infusion pharmacological cavernosography and cavernosometry (DICC) and the selective pharmacological phallo-arteriography.	0.4893460182180223
The procedures of this step are essentially limited to patients with erectile dysfunction who are planned for surgical interventions.	0.46352649067477564
Technological advances in the last two years in mammalian nuclear transfer techniques and the establishment of human embryonic stem cell lines formed the background of the International Workshop on "Embryonic Stem Cells and Nuclear Transfer Strategies" organized at the Gene Center, Munich, September 1999.	0.6082158063936459
The aim of the meeting was to bring together scientists working in the stem cell field and those working on somatic nuclear transfer techniques to discuss the present status and prospects of both technologies for basic and applied research and future use in medicine and livestock breeding.	0.5459551450984049
"Biology of Embryonic Stem Cells", "Nuclear Transfer Strategies", and "Stem Cell Differentiation - Cell Therapy" were the main topics of the meeting.	0.7758503725293474
It became clear that we are far from understanding the processes involved in stem cell self-renewal and differentiation and the mechanisms resulting in reprogramming of nuclei from somatic cells after transfer into enucleated oocytes.	0.42356545207307333
However, data were presented that showed the enormous potential of the embryonic stem cell technology for tissue transplantation in the future.	0.6205497950020766
Before any use of this technology in combination with any cloning technology for human cell therapy will be possible, further research including animal models and stem cell differentiation approaches in culture (i. e., identification of differentiation factors, selective differentiation strategies, reporter gene assays) is necessary to understand the basic principles of pluripotent stem cell differentiation and the mechanisms involved in reprogramming somatic cell nuclei.	0.6284404254351972
Certain fractures and/or dislocations of the femoral head are known to cause arterial injury and result in post-traumatic osteonecrosis.	0.6820928018031633
However, the more complex etiology of non-traumatic osteonecrosis is multifactorial and includes chemotherapy, radiotherapy, thermal injuries, and especially coagulopathies, which are now commonly observed in these patients.	0.8027746116363325
Intravascular coagulation with fibrin thrombosis begins in the capillaries and sinusoids of the intraosseous microcirculation, and residual venous thrombosis is more likely to occur if there is coexistent hypofibrinolysis.	0.5426281603814282
The aim of our study was to investigate the influence that serum of patients with preeclampsia has on t-PA and PAI-1 expression from human endothelial cells.	0.6009229602913474
For this purpose, we cultured human endothelium cells, gained from umbilical veins, for 24 h with sera of 7 patients with HELLP syndrome and 12 patients with preeclampsia.	0.7244244103097645
The sera of 12 normotensive pregnant patients and 9 non-pregnant women were used as controls.	0.46134679455970434
We then determined t-PA and PAI-1 levels by ELISA, both in the maternal serum and in the supernatant of the endothelial cell cultures.	0.5911556968227959
While t-PA levels were significantly higher in the serum of patients with preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome than in the control group (median: 8.0 ng/ml and 6.2 ng/ml vs 3.9 ng/ml and 3.1 ng/ml), levels of PAI-1 did not show any significant disparity among the different groups.	0.7879006826748293
The supernatant of the endothelial cell cultures demonstrated significantly elevated levels of both t-PA (P<0.001) and PAI-1 (P<0.01) when stimulated with serum gained from patients with preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome.	0.5731362249928271
The increased expression of t-PA and PAI-1 from human endothelium cells after stimulation with the serum of preeclamptic patients must be considered as a sign of increased endothelial cell activation.	0.5730651132804911
Postoperative pain relief can be achieved by several methods, including the use of systemic opioids and regional anaesthesia with intrathecal or epidural opioids or local anaesthetics.	0.6682237471601009
On-demand analgesia using a PCA (patient-controlled analgesia) system is regarded as the ideal option for systemic opioid analgesia.	0.5664693859286578
While PCA devices are not yet commonly used in all recovery units, the use of repetitive boluses on demand is still the most frequent form of administration in postoperative pain therapy.	0.7020938264058797
The objective of the present study was to show if continuous infusion of the opioid tramadol could produce better analgesia than repetitive administration of boluses.	0.6232564661144122
In a study under double-blind conditions 135 ASA I and II patients were assigned at random to group I (infusion group) or group B (bolus group) when they first requested pain treatment after abdominal surgery.	0.6552393336715635
The patients in group I received an initial intravenous loading dose of 100 mg tramadol, followed by an infusion of 12 mg/h tramadol for 24 h; if necessary, repeated boluses of 50 mg tramadol were given.	0.6483123842156503
In group B the patients received a placebo infusion instead of the tramadol infusion; otherwise, the procedure was the same.	0.8481394023033317
Pain relief was monitored by means of a VAS (visual analogue scale) up to 6 h after surgery.	0.6583663045259549
We investigated the retrograde assessment of analgesia by the patients after 6 h, how often repetitive boluses were required, and the amount of analgesics administered in 6 and 24 h. Results.	0.723847153187072
The pain relief was assessed as excellent or good by 76.5% of group I and 65.6% of group B; 19.1% of group I and 26.9% of group B assessed the analgesic effect as satisfactory; 4.4% of group I and 7.5% of group B complained of insufficient analgesia.	0.8888469003895515
In group I 69.2% requested only one or no repetitive bolus, compared with 40.3% in group B, while two or more boluses were demanded by 30.8% in group I and 59.7% in group B.	0.853781449365276
The average analgesic consumption after 6 h was 223.5 +/- 53.7 mg tramadol in group I and 176.6 +/- 63.1 mg tramadol in group B, respectively.	0.6079723059151279
After 24 h it was 449.5 +/- 66.0 mg tramadol in group I and 201.6 +/- 83.9 mg tramadol in group B.	0.5455335339792424
While the consumption during the first 6 h was comparable, from then on the consumption in group I increased significantly.	0.7341920467792573
Side effects were reported by 25% in both groups.	0.8772531984874622
They were clinically irrelevant and did not necessitate termination of the clinical trial in any case.	0.5808353631497631
During the study period pulse and blood pressure remained within the normal range and did not show any significant changes.	0.7080547522377996
The fact that the patients in group I requested far fewer repetitive boluses than those in group B and the assessment by the patients led to the conclusion that treatment in the infusion group is better than that in the bolus group.	0.8519782610149704
Concerns that a significantly higher consumption of analgesics would cause unwanted side-effects have proven unfounded.	0.48054798233184265
Six hours after surgery, when analgesia was evaluated by the patients, there was no significant difference between the two groups.	0.8078825247490723
Not until the maintenance infusion had been administered for a further 18 h, was the tramadol consumption within the infusion group significantly higher.	0.619965950425992
Thus, we should consider continuing unreduced administration of the maintenance infusion 6 h after operation.	0.6836341853821585
The concept of tuberculid was introduced by Darier in 1896.	0.32005030637422455
In contrast to "true" cutaneous tuberculosis, properties of the tuberculids were explained by an hyperergic response to myobacteria or their fragments released from a different site of manifest or passed tuberculous infection.	0.5077259479650379
Key features include a strongly positive tuberculin skin test, evidence of concomitant manifest or past tuberculosis, and prompt response to antituberculous therapy The inability to culture M. tuberculosis or to demonstrate it microscopically from lesional biopsies, together with reports on tuberculid-like eruptions after BCG vaccination, supports this concept.	0.45080465470157816
Clinical manifestations are lichen scrophulosorum, papulo-necrotic tuberculids and erythema induratum of Bazin.	0.2708604485630151
The existence of tuberculids has been questioned, however, because the clinical and histological appearances are not always specific.	0.7892109042509621
An increasing number of case reports on tuberculids, new immunological tests and molecular biology-based techniques for the detection of mycobacteria have shed new light on the tuberculid concept.	0.5380181233263909

The prognosis of patients with malignant diseases requiring treatment on intensive care units is poor.	0.7839259385340059
The hospital mortality for mechanically ventilated patients ranges from 70-90% in patients with solid tumors to 75-90% in patients with hematological malignancy and up to 95% in patients after bone marrow transplantation.	0.8481992668078757
The number of patients referred to intensive care units is however increasing, due to improvements in the general treatment of malignant diseases.	0.6367156697652442
This results in controversies about the utilization of intensive care treatment in these patients.	0.5800712909374186
Since the individual outcome can not be predicted prior to initiation of intensive care therapy a general refusal of intensive care treatment seems not justified.	0.5573961228902536
A reevaluation of the patients status after initiation of intensive care treatment based on predefined criteria may however be useful in the decision about continuing intensive care measures.	0.6855650143410081
Patients requiring mechanical ventilation after bone marrow transplantation will not survive if prolonged treatment with vasopressors is necessary and/or sustained hepatic and renal failure is present.	0.5252198050055308
For these patients a withdrawal of further life support may be considered.	0.6248535988066959
Intensive care treatment should be continued in patients not fulfilling these criteria and treatment results are comparable to those in patients without malignant diseases.	0.7179276019286531
For other patients with malignant diseases the use of a new score system developed for patients with cancer can be helpful in the clinical decision making.	0.8351933268867685
On the basis of a solution-oriented marital therapy, the different within-session effects of four different types of questions in systemic therapy (lineal, strategic, circular, and reflexive), as described by Tomm (1989), were tested.	0.6517872440776856
In this single case study, the method of plan analysis (Caspar 1989) was used to categorize the client's reactions to the four types of therapeutic questions.	0.7446895464740589
Lineal and strategic questions were expected to have a stabilizing and restraining effect on the system (i.e.	0.5446799925499194
the client, the clients' interaction, and the therapeutic interaction), whereas circular and reflexive questions were expected to open the system for change.	0.7294093457863369
Interestingly this hypothesis was only supported for the wife, who had the role of the identified client in the therapy and demonstrated a much stronger motivation for change.	0.6862645351881418
For the husband, who preferred the role of a cotherapist and demonstrated only little motivation for change, results were not as predicted.	0.6210990633230614
Some of his reactions were even opposite to the expected therapeutic effects.	0.41951429710840543
Therefore, it is suggested that an interaction effect between questions and the motivation for change can be assumed.	0.7003181143366438
Prerequisites for experimental study designs are extremely difficult to realise under prehospital emergency conditions.	0.3389321371249499
Results obtained in animal experiments always need validation with prehospital or inhospital patient studies.	0.41032552229538316
Investigations related to emergency medicine are, however, an ethical obligation on behalf of the patient.	0.5243318338605394
A retrospective analysis of the available literature should be considered a prerequisite for prospective randomised and controlled studies.	0.8993006675985784
Frequently, a pilot study or feasibility trial needs to precede the actual study.	0.49024349618602503
Informed consent must be obtained for all patient studies.	0.3507599934037461
However, under emergency conditions informed consent cannot always be obtained due to unconsciousness, etc.	0.44483854283065094
Nevertheless, the following principles should be observed: (a) randomised studies are essential, even in emergency medicine; (b) they are ethically acceptable if the treatment provided for the study group is at least equivalent to the therapy for the control group; ( c) only these preconditions guarantee that the patient always receives treatment in accordance with the standard of treatment.	0.8570336555601932
If the patient is unconscious or otherwise unable to give informed consent, the principle of deferred consent is acceptable.	0.5869548436040074
The deferred consent principle should be carefully documented.	0.32930527238610935
A prospective randomized study represents the gold standard for an investigation, even under emergency conditions.	0.7231716596641229
There are different principles of randomization: telephone or telefax randomisation, etc.	0.3457750509475494
Emergency medicine investigations need to be completed within a reasonable time frame which should, as a rule, not exceed 2 years.	0.7433217940044126
Otherwise, too many items might change without being noted.	0.43408858780819276
Curative treatment and the intention to treat are terms employed by ethics committees.	0.49315323982265946
If an investigation does not bear in itself additional risk factors, it does not necessarily have to be brought before the ethics committee.	0.5693296741153598
If, however, for example, the effect of obtaining blood samples is investigated separately for research purposes, the patient needs to be informed and sign the respective agreement.	0.6578518261225068
In Germany the ethics committees have agreed to accept their respective decisions.	0.46394395624219315
For multicentre and multinational studies, however, the ethics committees also need to accept decisions made by non-German ethics committees.	0.4791708978241731
Not all therapeutic principles can serve as the basis of prospective randomized studies because they need to be considered the present standard of care (e.g., endotracheal intubation, etc.).	0.643089918164669
Nevertheless, the feasibility of a study should be assessed according to the 1-3 rating proposed by the American Heart Association.	0.7208873071235193
In principle, the overall emergency physician protocol does not fulfill scientific requirements.	0.5672615967484623
For all studies, particularly in the prehospital setting, an independent observer should be involved for documentation purposes.	0.6460934445471083
Scores can be of importance for investigating different treatment regimens.	0.4758078266677867
Biases in emergency medicine studies focus on the variability of EMS, personnel qualifications, etc.	0.45051617504198743
This is in part why it is extremely difficult to prove efficacy and efficiency in emergency medicine.	0.5590723090394863
The results of emergency medicine investigations should be published in suitable journals, i.e., journals with a reasonable rating.	0.5549212433067408
New antifungals for oral therapy have improved the chances of healing onychomycoses.	0.3948853152685559
Nevertheless, in daily practice the failure rate is 20-30% both with itraconazole and terbinafine.	0.7500129667338189
In our investigations for the fungicidal effects of terbinafine, we could show that the same strain of Trichophyton rubrum or T. mentagrophytes in the rest period needs 1000 times higher concentration of terbinafine (2,0 to 0,002 µg/ml) for complete fungal killing as in the growth phase.	0.6696470190411455
Thus resting fungi in the nail are not harmed, and if the concentration of terbinafine is lower than the MIC for the fungi, they can cause a relapse.	0.6813490156413607
Itraconazole is a fungistatic agent.	0.2025132365361857
Its concentration in the nail plate must be higher than the MIC for the causative fungi for a long time - 10 to 12 months.	0.7143325214164629
The usual short-term treatment of onychomycosis over 3 months can be insufficient in individual cases such as patients with disorders, e.g.	0.5528822318666684
circulatory disorders or slowed nail growth.	0.22148915297812244
This paper presents an algorithm for automatic switching between atrial tracking and nontracking pacing mode based on a "4 out of 7" concept: if 4 out of 7 atrial intervals are sensed below a critical value, mode switching (MS) is automatically performed.	0.569426815125878
The technical solution in Medtronic Kappa 700 dual chamber devices is explained together with an evaluation of advantages and possible limitations.	0.3776387596661076
The "4 out of 7" algorithm offers a quick MS; by the addition of a "blanked flutter search" algorithm integrated into this concept, the detection of atrial flutter is facilitated in a wider range of programmed AV intervals.	0.5977940552443811
With the increased rapidity of MS and sensitivity towards atrial flutter detection, there is also an increased propensity to switch to the nontracking mode in case of short atrial runs and frequent premature atrial beats.	0.5231725635946148
Therefore, to optimize the MS function, programming of the device (e.g., activation of a time delay before MS) should be carried out individually with respect to the intrinsic rhythm and arrhythmia of the patient.	0.6005891271618785
Possible interactions between different programmable parameters should also be taken into consideration.	0.4281426359308006
Some guidelines are presented in this paper.	0.5618891842031193
Finally, the use of extended stored diagnostic data seems to be crucial to evaluate pacemaker performance, incidence of atrial arrhythmias, and (as far as possible) confirmation of the stored data themselves by assessment of stored intracardiac electrograms.	0.6455372854721065
Between 1983 and 1991 ten patients with chronic frontal sinus disease underwent frontal osteoplastic flaps with fat obliteration.	0.509254589972822
In order to judge operative success on a long-term basis all patients were called for postoperative follow-up.	0.5303997555008269
They then completed a questionaire, in which they were asked about postoperative complaints.	0.683583324570835
Additionally, sinuses were examined by computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MR).	0.49563002250015264
Among the patients evaluated seven had no complaints, and no evidence of disease could be found by medical examination.	0.8354645774570585
CT scans showed complete obliteration of the frontal sinuses in all patients.	0.6409086842657666
In these patients, two-thirds of the fat had been replaced by connective tissue.	0.5292933385830412
MR was used in an attempt to show evidence for suppurative disease in the frontal sinus, but the MR images failed to correlate with symptoms.	0.7843627426482852
Additional results could not be obtained when compared to CT.	0.5402210669283343
Overall operating success could only be determined by clinical assessment and confirmed the value of the frontal osteoplastic flap with fat obliteration.	0.6313347426434508
The objective of our trial was to evaluate the significance and usefulness of sentinel lymphadenectomy (SLNE) for the staging of regional lymph nodes in breast cancer patients.	0.6892244594023856
The study presented illustrates the method and our results.	0.5477644458807052
As has been documentated for melanoma, the first lymph node [sentinel node (SLN)] to receive lymphatic drainage from a primary tumor is the expected first site of lymph-node metastasis.	0.5791217660795522
The database presented includes 12 patients with operable breast cancer and clinically negative lymph nodes.	0.3958066903890266
In 11 cases the described method was applicable.	0.5045767326119583
In only one case was there no correlation between the histology of the SLN and the axillary specimen.	0.571418682874401
Successful completion of examination of a large number of patients with a long follow-up has the potential of reducing the number of axillary dissections and of significantly reducing morbidity in the majority of breast cancer patients.	0.7510561799065987
Background: Information on the extent and degree of the thermal effect produced is of great importance for control of the laser dosage in laser thermokeratoplasty (LTK) and for postoperative follow-up.	0.7327075447625061
We investigated on acute LTK effects which information images obtained by optical low coherence tomography (OCT) offer compared to those obtained by polarization microscopy.	0.4715765808197817
In cases with protected left main stenosis by previous bypass surgery or as an emergency intervention in patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is performed as an alternative treatment strategy to bypass surgery.	0.7283154010240909
A review of 262 left main angioplasties revealed a procedure-related mortality in cases without protection of the left main coronary artery of 9.1% (4/44), in cases with partially protected left main stenosis by collaterals to either left coronary artery of 4.8% (1/21) and 0.5% (1/187) in cases with nonobstructed bypass grafts to either left coronary artery.	0.8795449518715381
Coronary angioplasty of an unprotected left main coronary artery, had an unacceptably high procedure-related mortality rate and should therefore not be performed even in cases of emergency intervention.	0.6351306404104545
The risk stratification of the procedure can be evaluated by the proposed grading of left main artery protection.	0.7520913624140708
Hypocalcemia is a relatively uncommon reversible cause of congestive heart failure.	0.3900009176643573
There are a few reports of hypocalcemic children who developed congestive heart failure associated with hypoparathyroidism.	0.6003056639094403
In all these patients, however, cardiac failure did not occur before the age of nine years.	0.6037281499799503
In addition, other striking noncardial manifestations of hypoparathyroidism, e.g., convulsive seizures, had been present prior to cardiac symptoms.	0.5790565407540069
In this publication, Nager syndrome was analyzed in the literature and six patients from our clinic were evaluated in relation to symptoms, etiology and pathogenesis.	0.7438718875856178
The diseases to be considered when making a differential diagnostis are pointed out.	0.58490391945153
Clarification of the etiology is still pending.	0.5202634777374194
Molecular genetic research in these patients is possibly the key for new findings.	0.5412195880069289
A case report illustrates the results of interdisciplinary treatment by the surgeon and orthodontist.	0.7671184070932354
Possibilities and problems in relation to therapy are demonstrated.	0.5517763597131267
The results of ankle arthroplasty have generally been disappointing compared to other forms of arthroplasty.	0.5455327287236067
The present survey of results of ankle arthroplasty deals with the anatomical, the kinemasiological the biomechanical and the biological features of the ankle joint.	0.6960729535368513
These features all seem important prerequisites for a successful total ankle prosthesis design.	0.39232809014800146
From the study of the results displayed in the literature and those of my own series it can be stated that a modern ankle arthroplasty should respect the normal anatomy and kinemasiology.	0.7224680975680438
Biomechanically it should work as a normal ankle joint i. e. cylindrical mobility, congruency and a possibility for normal torque within the ankle mortise.	0.464809772934998
The prosthesis components should only be fixed in solid subchondral bone, and preferably without cement.	0.5118053106777496
Only compressible forces should act at the bone-prosthesis interface.	0.3843610125207538
The axis of the ankle joint as well as of that of the hindfoot should be aligned to normal.	0.8164537047286581
Meticulous surgery and special guide instruments are absolute necessities.	0.28863987513218536
Restoration of muscle power and gait postoperatively are essential for a good and lasting result.	0.6170002726899472
The indication for ankle arthroplasty is mainly cases of osteoarthritis (primary or traumatic) and rheumatoid arthritis.	0.6424411307142135
Contraindications are talus necrosis, Charcot joints, extreme osteoporosis, severe arteriosclerosis, and very aggressive arthritis.	0.5301696655096376
Mental disorders and neurological disorders may also be contraindications.	0.4931244489877689
Furthermore, the patients should agree not to perform sports involving jumping and running or other ankle demanding activities.	0.5938448034938579
The average annual failure rate should not exceed 1 % if these recommendations are followed.	0.5841056648970495
Elbow flexion plays a key role in the overall function of the upper extremity.	0.7362159289430896
In the case of unilateral complete brachial plexus lesion, restoration of elbow flexion will dramatically increase the patient's chances of regaining bimanual prehension.	0.5001018275500647
Furthermore, depending on the type of reconstruction, stability of the glenohumeral joint as well as some supination function of the forearm can be restored to a varying degree at the same time.	0.5357821797031096
Depending on the level of brachial plexus lesion and/or reinnervation, different reconstructive procedures are available.	0.5516428595754044
In order to select the best treatment option for the patient it is necessary to known the extent of the lesion of the brachial plexus and/or ventral upper arm muscles, to time the operation appropriately, to be aware of all treatment possibilities and to recall the special problems of tendon transfer for brachial plexus patients.	0.7143350115081181
Our concept is based on our experience with more than 1100 patients presenting a brachial plexus lesion between 1981 and 1996 and treated in our institution.	0.6707637562828626
There were 528 operative revisions of the brachial plexus.	0.323925018133127
Some 225 patients underwent secondary muscle/tendon transfers.	0.2645272314510456
In 35 patients elbow flexion was reconstructed by bipolar latissimus dorsi transfer (n = 10), triceps-to-biceps transfer (n = 15), modified flexor/pronator muscle mass proximalization (n = 6) and multiple-stage free functional muscle transfer after intercostal nerve transfer (n = 4).	0.4885392613484956
The official German guidelines for prevention of intravascular-device-associated infections were published by the Bundesgesundheitsamt, now called the Robert-Koch-Institut, 12 years ago.	0.43290251390871276
The recently published official "Guidelines for Prevention of Intravascular-Device Associated Infections" of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are categorized according to scientific evidence.	0.42094499958331993
The American guidelines are very detailed and differ in some aspects from the offical German guidelines.	0.26777168339659774
The purpose of the present paper is to inform the German-speaking anaesthesiologist about the official CDC guidelines and to provide an update on the prevention of intravascular-device-associated infections.	0.6134285228064856
We assessed the interindividual diagnostic variance of 39 experienced arthroscopists by the Kappa Cohen interobserver variation analysis using videotapes of eight different patients with different diagnoses.	0.4028913715769858
Arthroscopically normal findings showed a relatively acceptable interobserver correlation.	0.3753466918903553
Pathological changes, in contrast, often showed very little correlation, especially in the synovial membrane of the suprapatellar recess, in the cartilage of the femoropatellar groove and the posterior cruciate ligament.	0.7922030282467009
In patellar alignment there was also great interobserver variation.	0.4019429122103884
Clinical relevance: When comparing arthroscopic findings with other imaging techniques the above results should be taken into account.	0.4576497664030249
Furthermore, these results will affect the significance of medical expertise based only on pictures.	0.6002653841858735
In addition, medical cost billing, which is based on arthroscopic findings, has to take into account that a wrong diagnosis is possible and therefore charges will be wrong.	0.783198365354645
Squamous metaplasia can be demonstrated in about 4% of all invasive carcinomas of the breast.	0.9045062616606744
Primary squamous cell carcinomas of the breast are rare, since they occur in less than 1% of all primary invasive breast carcinomas.	0.8529035569561072
In order to classify a breast tumor as a primary squamous cell carcinoma one must exclude an epidermal origin, especially from the nipple region and the possibility of metastatic infiltration of the breast by a squamous cell carcnoma from a different location.	0.7096575338482402
Causative and formal pathogenesis of primary squamous cell carcinoma of the breast is not clear.	0.6077526776413021
A pluripotent embryonal stem cell origin is discussed, considering the phylogenetic descent of the mammary gland from skin appendages.	0.3261882527818246
Squamous metaplasia is also suggested to be a precursor of squamous cell carcinoma.	0.629842388589224
Here endocrine stimulation and chronic inflammation may both play an inductive role.	0.3654500624840336
The number of published cases of squamous cell carcinomas developing years and decades after implantation of silicon prostheses has increased in recent years.	0.5483373373146136
These tumors probably develop on top of squamous metaplasia induced by the inflammatory pseudocapsule.	0.42115819905371893
The limited success of thrombolytic therapy and the high percentage of patients who have to be excluded from lysis has resulted in the alternative application of primary PTCA in acute myocardial infarction.	0.8121790595813488
Randomized studies so far available have shown a significant decrease of hospital mortality by primary PTCA as compared to thrombolysis.	0.6165137564214116
Adjuvant stent implantation and a wider administration of glycoprotein IIA/IIIB inhibitors may further reduce mortality.	0.3833338074077041
For logistic and financial reasons however, not all patients with acute myocardial infarction can benefit from this therapeutic approach in spite of the high density of health care in Germany.	0.8002388045593726
Primary PTCA in acute myocardial infarction should be left to experienced centres and investigators.	0.31876876384071073
Of utmost importance is a reduction of the present "onset-to-opening" times by information campaigns, an improved triage, use of transportation times for pre-hospital lysis and improved thrombolytic agents.	0.57316142356519
Some 245,000 sporting accidents occur yearly in Switzerland.	0.22712002306602477
The social accident costs amount to approximately 1.8 billion francs per year.	0.44343789642338804
Every second sporting accident occurs during a ball game.	0.2832945573763724
For the shown sporting activities, distortion is the most common type of injury among adults and contained fractures are most common in children.	0.6102603910469638
As is to be expected, the number of accidents has grown along with the exploding popularity of snowboarding and in-line skating.	0.6817671324054371
These new sporting activities show no unknown injury patterns which would demand new treatment methods.	0.32898218768373416
Abstract:  The combination of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows the localization and functional characterization of the somatosensory and motor cortex.	0.5780829537629778
However, this method is technically pretentious and time consuming.	0.7370180049132674
Therefore, functional imaging is still not established as routine procedure in neurosurgery.	0.6638275360010156
The aim of the presented study was the development of a protocol, which allows the integration of functional MEG data into presurgical planning and intraoperative navigation, as a routine method.	0.959042160257325
We report on a 15-year-old girl and her relatives with typical features of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIII.	0.5573291153334051
Main symptoms of this disorder are fragile skin, easy bruisability, joint hypermobility, features suggesting premature aging, and periodontal disease with early loss of teeth.	0.5131896943299287
The inheritance of this type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is autosomal dominant.	0.3250816479384925
The biochemical and genetic defects have not yet been elucidated.	0.4329586137857993
The acute liver failure (ALF) is a complex syndrome resulting from loss of synthetic and metabolic functions of the liver.	0.6945836704233664
Despite recent advances in intensive care medicine patients with severe ALF have a very high mortality and the orthotopic liver transplantation still remains the only proven effective treatment of ALF.	0.66408262363499
Numerous attempts have been made to improve survival by using various extracorporeal support techniques, but none of these therapeutic approaches was able to increase the survival rate.	0.7057329043369401
Liver support systems based on detoxification procedures only could not influence the deleterious course of the disease.	0.44615281130959683
It is certain that an ideal liver support system should be capable to fulfil the liver's essential synthetic and metabolic functions as well as detoxification and excretion.	0.4022742329899298
Over the last years the development of hybrid liver assist devices has aimed at replacing these liver functions and therefore might give an advantage over earlier systems based on detoxification techniques only.	0.4948749975383251
This article gives a short review of the various liver support systems and focuses then on the hybrid liver support systems, their construction and the remaining problems after the first clinical applications.	0.7591441157327367
After a latency period of 20 years, in a 39-year-old Austrian citizen of Chinese origin, a surgically removed rectal carcinoma, as well as the neighboring chronic inflammatory rectal mucosa with various degrees of dysplasia and one positive neighboring lymph node, showed helminthiasis in the histopathological examination, convincing us of a link between carcinoma and chronic helminthiasis.	0.6012188605436981
Whereas the etiological context between chronic infection by Schistosoma haematobium and endemic frequent urinary bladder carcinoma is considered a matter of fact, whether of not the incidence of intestinal carcinoma is increased in connection with chronic intestinal schistosomiasis is controversial.	0.5264962935494374
The etiological and pathogenetic link between helminthiasis and carcinoma should be considered in the same way as for other related inflammatory large-bowel diseases.	0.5433154985254954
In the sequence chronic inflammation - severe dysplasia, the formation of carcinoma could possibly occur.	0.6471223795728268
Besides a survey of trematodes parasitology and pathology, the link between rectal carcinoma and Schistosomiasis japonicum is pointed out by means of appropriate literature investigations.	0.4889407832557519
Rupture of the carotid artery wall is a very rare postoperative complication.	0.5567198129799633
Mainly ruptures of vein patches are described in the literature.	0.40673679837213045
This paper reports on a 51-year-old patient with elective endarterectomy of the left internal carotid artery using V-Y technique.	0.6812027818488817
On day 8 after operation, the carotid bulb ruptured.	0.4993665058313072
The suture line was not involved.	0.272112833786521
The rupture was due to local wall necrosis, as verified by histologic examination.	0.5833150749408473
In an emergency procedure the necrotized tissue was resected and repaired using a Dacron patch.	0.49551992890069974
Postoperatively the patient showed paresis of the left recurrent nerve but fortunately did not suffer any other neurological deficit.	0.5747176394570519
Myocardial stunning (contractile dysfunction in the presence of normalized perfusion) and myocardial hibernation (contractile dysfunction matching reduced perfusion) have represented separate concepts of viable, but dyssynergic myocardium in the past.	0.6143730218453296
However, in vivo experimental and clinical work suggests that repetitive ischemia due to coronary artery disease may induce a gradual transition between stunned and hibernating myocardium.	0.5500328485454172
Myocardial hibernation itself can result from a spectrum of ischemic conditions ranging from impaired myocardial blood flow reserve to frank hypoperfusion.	0.41874843799385475
With increasing severity and duration of ischemia, degeneration of cardiac myocytes, accumulation of glycogen and cell death ensue.	0.49198974498625014
Additonally, there is an increase of extracellular matrix protein content leading to reparative fibrosis, which in turn limits functional recovery.	0.682149397494334
In the light of these structural features, the available methods for detection of viable myocardium, in particular dobutamine echocardiography and nuclear imaging techniques, offer complementary rather than contradictory information.	0.684051068360866
Dobutamine echo has satisfactory sensitivity, excellent specificity, and high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of viable dyssynergic myocardium.	0.6265106228507367
While in the past only its predictive accuracy for segmental recovery has been validated, newer data show an improved survival after revascularization if at least four viable dyssynergic left ventricular segments in a 16 segment model can be identified by dobutamine echocardiography.	0.49171284179441377
The complete (low and high dose) dobutamine protocol can elicit several types of contractile responses (sustained improvement in contraction or monophasic response, biphasic response, new wall motion abnormality) which should be interpreted in view of other clinical data including a previous infarction.	0.5962159424660826
The test protocol can be used safely at the end of the first week after myocardial infarction.	0.757836705550749
If ischemia or viability is documented, revascularization should be performed promptly.	0.4900369180291727
A similar strategy should be followed in the setting of chronic coronary heart disease with left ventricular dysfunction.	0.5248612841664799
Since the structural changes of hibernating myocardium are progressive, time to revascularization is critical.	0.5052644765497518
On the other hand, responsible therapeutic planning requires proof of ischemia or viability before initiating a potentially hazardous revascularization procedure.	0.33438511301886853
The coarctation of the aorta is a congenital narrowing of the aorta in the transitional area between the distal aortic arch and the proximal descending aorta.	0.6332935062439754
The coarctation causes an arterial hypertension of the upper half and an arterial hypotension of the lower half of the body.	0.7542426965287167
The indication for operative repair is given because of the hypertension with strain and possible insufficiency of the heart.	0.629563412113728
The resection of the narrowed part of the aorta with end-to-end anastomosis or interposition of a prosthesis brings on the risk of a recoarctation.	0.6458597419689867
After a Vosschulte-aortoplasty a recurrent coarctation is rarely seen.	0.34678147700589607
This method, however, brings on a higher risk of the development of an aneurysm.	0.6387832875703516
In the following it is reported about a patient who underwent an operation due to an aneurysm 22 years after a Vosschulte-aortoplasty.	0.7416718602749434
The aging of the Italian population is an emerging public health priority.	0.3678234062781209
In 2025 Italy is expected to have the highest world median age with nearly half of the population over 50 years old.	0.6319105801159203
To avoid an unbearable burden of disease and disability on future generations, we must identify areas for intensive disease and disability prevention programs.	0.6663052306824516
A 14 year old macedonic girl was admitted with recurrent colicky abdominal pain that had lasted for several weeks.	0.3842132025700681
Laboratory check, plain abdominal film and abdominal sonography did not show abnormalitities immediately.	0.41806965476476354
Increasing enzyme parameters though indicated cholestasis.	0.16192672235935396
Endoscopic retrograde choledocho-pancreaticography (ERCP) was performed after abdominal sonography showed a dilatation of the choledochus.	0.6190134011739703
It revealed a common-channel situation (ductus choledochus and pancreaticus) and choledocholithiasis.	0.48850458686838166
Papillotomy and stone-extraction could not remove abdominal pain.	0.24115014579354854
Laparatomy and choledocho-jejunostomy could finally remove the symptoms.	0.20105663116669206
Successful transplantation of autologous chondrocytes for repair of articular cartilage defects requires an undisturbed matrix-synthesis of the transplanted cells.	0.5469845557143923
This, in turn, is dependent on the composition of the synovial fluid (SF) of the respective joint.	0.8554139577666675
We addressed the question whether analysis of a patient's SF can predict the rate of matrix-synthesis of articular cartilage exposed to this SF in vitro.	0.6966810174171566
SF was obtained from 115 patients with disorders of the knee, including gonarthrosis (n = 44), meniscal tears (n = 10), rheumatoid arthritis (n = 53), and reactive arthritides (n = 8).	0.5845349761971399
In the SF, the following parameters were determined: Interleukin-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1-RA, TNF, Insulin-like growth-factor I (IGF-I), IGF-II, IGF-binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2), IGFBP-3 as well as total proteinase activity and total collagenase activity.	0.6472025231625532
To assess the effect of SF on the matrix synthesis of articular chondrocytes, bovine cartilage was incubated in the presence of SF, and the rate of proteoglycan synthesis subsequently determined.	0.602826412594034
In some cases, a monoclonal antibody directed against IGF-I was added.	0.5621106213679147
SF from patients with OA or trauma, respectively, stimulated PG-synthesis of bovine cartilage more markedly than did SF from patients with rheumatic arthritides.	0.490454847663434
On the average, 60 percent of the SF-induced increase of cartilage matrix synthesis could be titrated out by an anti-IGF-I-AB.	0.5258336126040074
The best predictor for the SF-effects on PG-synthesis of exposed cartilage was the proportion of free IGF-I (r = 0.573, p < 0.001, Spearman rank correlation) followed by the SF-concentrations of IGF-I (with a positive sign), IGFBP-3, IL-1, and TNF (all with a negative sign).	0.6119402094070272
According to our data, IGF-I is the most important anabolic factor in human SF with respect to cartilage PG-synthesis.	0.6215327334441725
The proportion of free IGF-I seems to be of special importance in this regard.	0.6166675576740066
Low SF-levels of free IGF-I could be identified as a possible risk-factor for a sub-optimal protoeglycan synthesis of chondrocytes exposed to this synovial milieu.	0.609507235537377
The coincidence between panic disorder and depression is a well known phenomenon.	0.4947854132667924
However, only few studies investigated the coincidence of panic disorder with schizophrenia.	0.6595783084056811
This may in part be explained by the fact that both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia may mask the clinical symptoms of a panic disorder.	0.5922070607457839
We report on a female patient suffering both from agoraphobia with panic disorder and paranoid schizophrenia according to ICD-10.	0.48764500615522893
The productive psychotic symptoms responded well to treatment with a low dose of zotepine, whereas the panic disorder was effectively treated with a combined therapy with imipramine and cognitive behavioral therapy.	0.6910495219619066
Although it has to be questioned whether the coincidence between panic disorder and schizophrenia reflects two different diagnostic entities, the occurence of symptoms of a panic disorder in schizophrenia deserve further attention because these may be treated efficiently by a specific pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy.	0.5351486791946013
A 54-year-old female patient with a 10-year history of ventriculoperitoneal shunt resulting from communicating hydrocephalus of undetermined aetiology is reported.	0.5233274352503404

In those children with birth weight below 2500 g the incidence was 6.8 permil.	0.5304746648005191
In 17 of 18 cases the cause of anemia could be clarified.	0.5185301398834596
In five preterm babies (28%) an acute fetofetal transfusion and in three newborns a fetomaternal transfusion was responsible for the onset of anemia.	0.5822155771592775
In two cases there was Rh incompatibility, in two cases placental bleeding, and in another two cases fetal tumour bleeding caused the anemia.	0.8891939729813834
In one fully developed newborn there was severe disseminated intestinal bleeding of unknown cause.	0.3274766423411374
Another child suffered from EBV infection, and one had trisomy 13 with multiple malformations.	0.6058081919187647

The prognosis can be influenced in a positive way.	0.5159219468643013
Diagnosis of bacterial infection and/or sepsis in critically ill patients is a common problem in intensive care medicine.	0.6735275011392993
White blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are often used in the differential diagnosis of infection versus SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome) due to noninfectious causes.	0.6922319584107379
There is a number of non-infectious stimuli to cause leucocytosis and CRP elevation.	0.5493501476998772
In the last 3 years, Procalcitonin (PCT) was determined to be a marker of severe bacterial infection, especially sepsis.	0.8908207556322328
PCT appears to have several advantages; it is of non-hepatic (yet unknown) origin and useful in patients with hepatic insufficiency.	0.5927748956359703
There is no PCT-increase in acute graft-rejection, viral disease, and autoimmune disorders.	0.5626994497269541
Some studys showed a prognostic value of PCT in sepsis due to peritonitis and pancreatitis.	0.41201818854667416
PCT appears to be a new and helpful tool in the diagnosis and treatment of critically ill patients.	0.7702553888484714
Further studies are needed to finally established PCT in the daily management of critically ill patients.	0.4658401114295594
At this time significantly higher costs are the major detraction to daily or frequent measurements.	0.4335603420826409
In this retrospective study, the meniscal status of 45 patients with conservatively treated complete anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears is reported.	0.45093060230984605
The ACL injury was initially documented by examination under anesthesia and arthroscopy.	0.42983484440062497
Treatment in all cases consisted of a standard protocol of early rehabilitation and bracing.	0.7207704751164076
The mean follow-up was 8 years.	0.6068098767213753
Twenty-nine (65%) patients showed signs of meniscal pathology at an average of 3 years after the ACL injury during the follow-up period.	0.783341311499739
Rearthroscopy was performed and showed a higher incidence of medial meniscus tears.	0.6333143093723699
The most common tear of the medial meniscus was the bucket-handle type, followed by the flap tear and the single longitudinal split of the posterior horn.	0.680591008820397
Secondary reconstruction of the ACL was necessary in 24 patients complaining of the meniscus giving way.	0.6569846601169002
The remaining five patients had rearthroscopy 4 years after the ACL injury and a partial meniscectomy and ACL reconstruction was performed.	0.6570163371307015
Sixteen patients (35% of the overall sample) had no instability complaints or meniscal pathology during the follow-up period, but discontinued their sporting activities.	0.7316310482511363
Results indicate the increasing incidence of meniscal tears during ACL insufficiency.	0.37692877175558187
We recommend that patients with ruptures of the ACL should be investigated for meniscal tears and that early ligament reconstruction of the knee and mensical repair or partial meniscectomy should be considered simultaneously.	0.7519613357969518
Four children, 4 to 10 years old, with chronic uveitis were treated with cyclosporin A (CsA; starting dosage 2 mg/kg per day) and prednisolone.	0.7979154004483088
All children had previously received systemic steroids and/or cytotoxic agents, which resulted either in a poor therapeutic effect or in intolerable side effects.	0.5585799642633875
In one child, suffering from uveitis in combination with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, a complete reduction of intraocular inflammation was achieved.	0.4973596727484288
In a second child treatment resulted in a marked reduction of inflammatory activity with stabilization of visual function, although a temporary increase in the steroid dosage was necessary at one stage.	0.6535337612616315
In the remaining two cases therapy failed to improve the intraocular inflammation.	0.6792460693913192
During the time of treatment, ranging from 11 to 26 months, no serious side effects were observed.	0.6844611153893376
All patients developed moderate hypertrichosis and one child gingival hyperplasia.	0.38546772940328977
In our <\d> experience, cyclosporin A (CsA) combined with low-dose systemic steroids is useful as a therapeutic alternative to steroids alone and to other immunosuppressive agents in severe cases of chronic uveitis in childhood.	0.6824869314984552
Allergic reactions in tattoos are comparatively rare.	0.23709904524990422
In most cases the reactions are caused by different red pigments.	0.615529245318125
While in the past these reactions have been ascribed to mercury salts (cinnebar) and cadmium sulphide, now synthetic inorganic azo dyes have also been found to be responsible for such reactions.	0.5795427067924216
A 42-year-old man presented with an allergic reaction in the red parts of his tattoos.	0.6174496067173223
Histologically a chronic granulomatous, partly fibrous inflammation with transfollicular elimination of pigment granules was found.	0.373446607476794
Spontaneous regression in a part of the inflammatory reaction was observed, simultaneously with depigmentation and scarring of the overlying skin.	0.4867587109039874
The pigment used for tattooing was found to be an aromatic azo derivative.	0.5455466850917186
In addition to a positive cutaneous reaction to the dye, the patient also showed a positive patch test to Napthol AS, used for the coupling of different dyes in the textile industry.	0.8186380050540615
Borrelia burgdorferi specific DNA has been detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in different specimens of patients with Lyme disease (LD).	0.6007869150451295
The aim of the present study is to evaluate PCR-diagnostic of urine specimens regarding rheumatologic diagnosis of Lyme disease.	0.6752870295785882
Urine specimens of 77 patients  (LD, n=34; undifferentiated arthritis (UA), n=25; arthralgia/myalgia (AM), n=18) and 15 controls were investigated.	0.543338249536343
Flagellin gene  (60 specimens) or OspA-plasmid  (32 specimens) were used as targets.	0.9311173410913021
Sensitivity of the flagellin-nested-PCR was 27%, by OspA-nested-PCR only one positive PCR result was found.	0.49365308639186617
Despite of low sensitivity PCR enabled the correct diagnosis of LD in two patients classified as UA.	0.5342670633115074
Therefore, PCR can give valuable hints in single cases if LD is clinically suspected.	0.34872897436501665
Objective: To assess the clinical efficacy of a chemically standardized willow bark extract in the treatment of osteoarthritis.	0.6105662131884488
Methods: Willow bark extract, in a dose corresponding to 240mg salicin/day, was compared to placebo in a 2-week, double-blind, randomized controlled trial.	0.7178237303405636
The primary outcome measure was the pain dimension of the WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index.	0.4483836256591594
Secondary outcome measures included the stiffness and physical function dimensions of the WOMAC, daily visual analogue scales (VAS) on pain and physical function, and final overall assessment by both patients and investigators.	0.6197999947385221
Results: 78 patients (39 willow bark extract, 39 placebo) participated in the trial.	0.6386109049637992
A statistically significant difference between active treatment and placebo group was observed in the WOMAC pain dimension (d=6.5mm, 95%C.I.=0.2-12.7mm, p=0.047); the WOMAC pain score was reduced by 14% from baseline level after two weeks of active treatment, compared to an increase of 2% in the placebo group.	0.6926031373769559
Patient diary VAS confirmed this result, and likewise the final overall assessments showed superiority of willow bark extract over placebo (patients assessment, p=0.0002; investigators assessment, p=0.0073).	0.4298416209558832
Conclusion: Willow bark extract shows a moderate analgesic effect in osteoarthritis.	0.35830570072989315
Background and methods: The aim of this study was to get more information about the prevalence of chronic pain in different practices of home physicians.	0.6468085412899744
900 patients of five different specialists (general medicine, internal medicine, neurology, orthopaedics, surgery) in the german town Bochum were investigated with a questionnaire about chronic pain.	0.692145753537181
Chronic pain was defined as a continuous or intermittend pain of longer duration than six months.	0.5159083950948653
Confusion between syncope and epileptic seizures is a common problem in clinical practice.	0.5713388875162605
Recently, new insights into the phenomenology of transient cerebral hypoxia have been gained from video analysis of experimentally induced syncope.	0.47829047972627764
Common elements of syncope include multifocal and generalized myoclonus, tonic body extension, automatisms, vocalizations, eye deviations and hallucinations.	0.36850512926369006
Thus, it is not the presence or absence of these features but their specific character that distinguishes syncope from epileptic seizures.	0.611107948819243
Other clues for differential diagnosis include precipitating factors, premonitory symptoms and postictal events, such as tongue bites and postictal confusion, which has been identified as the single most powerful factor discriminating syncope from epileptic seizures.	0.5434927521707028
In contrast, incontinence and head injury are common in both conditions.	0.4107961658976154
Investigations such as electroencephalogram, tilt testing and postictal prolactin or creatine kinase levels may aid diagnosis but are never diagnostic in isolation.	0.31055495786330045
In rare cases, hypoxic and epileptic mechanisms may interact within one attack.	0.4106087615101965
In the past two decades increasing research efforts have focused on the molecular biology of the cell.	0.7209136857880255
In the beginning, these research activities were purely academic without any direct clinical relation.	0.4284955576954365
A series of important discoveries, initiated particularly by the unravelling of the genetic code and the discovery of the molecular basis of gene expression and genetics, the subsequent identification of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes and finally the description of major mechanisms which induce genetic instability in cells, now indicate the way to many new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.	0.5781989308894007
In surgical oncology, these attempts are yielding the first clinical consequences.	0.5785400076219174
Basic aspects of molecular cell biology as far as they are relevant for surgical oncologists are discussed.	0.4469593121221864
The compartment syndrome (cs) is characterized by an increased tissue pressure in a limited space.	0.6971228959663767
Pathophysiologically, it is a multifactorial disease that is potentially induced by an initial trauma and develops according to the existence of cofactors.	0.6088348779349957
Cofactors are, for instance, the circulation of the patient and the initial treatment of the impending cs.	1.0121480059163774
In particular, the microcirculation is altered with endothelial destruction, development of a capillary leak, protein loss from intravasal space and the development of an interstitial and intracellular third space.	0.5903305542551376
An impaired drainage of the lymphatic and venous system causes a venous infarction.	0.48592239898098516
An arterial infarction results if the tissue pressure exceeds the arteriolar pressure.	0.33338561189525134
An accompanying ischemia reperfusion mechanism increases the trauma load.	0.28355183930084943
In disadvantageous cases, the patients are in danger of developing a multi-organ deficiency syndrome (MODS) by an uncontrolled inflammatory reaction, by intravasal volume loss and by a myonephropathic systemic reaction.	0.6853977036778652
Clinically, the patients suffer a disproportionate amount of pain, followed by neurological signs.	0.6342012966010643
Especially in noncompliant patients, tissue pressure measurement is useful.	0.5242844140976753
Resuscitation of the circulation as well as splitting of casts is important.	0.4309057127349272
In case of a manifest cs, dermatofasciotomy has to be performed as an emergency operation.	0.8602413997524659
Even if cs is diagnosed early and fasciotomy is carried out early, the development of sequellae cannot be avoided in every single case.	0.5097625272811684
The object of this study was to evaluate retrospectively the value of open and arthroscopic procedures at mid-term and long-term follow-up.	0.5817552019634926
During the period from January 1980 to June 1997 we performed 247 open (technique: 134 according to Eden-Hybbinette-Lange, 46 according to Weber, 26 according to Putti-Platt, 41 according to Bankart) and 76 arthroscopic (transglenoidal Morgan technique) shoulder stabilization procedures.	0.5114659961417369
The mean follow-up for techniques was: Eden-Hybbinette-Lange 11.1 years (2.9-16.7 years), Weber 5.2 years (2.1-13.0 years), Putti-Platt 7.2 years (2.2-10.6 years), Bankart 1.6 years (0.5-3.2 years), and Morgan 3.5 years (2.8-5.1 years).	0.981043615479438
We observed that the classic open Bankart procedure has superior results according to the criteria redislocation, range of motion, sports activity, and arthrosis in comparison with the other open procedures.	0.6783644211663641
The results shows that nonanatomical, reconstructive, open procedures are not up to date.	0.5293086940929758
The open Bankart procedure reconstructs the pathology of the anterior glenoid rim only.	0.6343245624853833
The classic open Bankart procedure seems to be the "gold standard" in open shoulder surgery today.	0.6105235852388962
The high redislocation rate of the arthroscopic procedure warrants a more stringent patient selection in the future.	0.5085289892650298

Hyperkalemia is a frequent disturbance.	0.5189764636525628
When hyperkalemia is associated with a rapid rise of the serum potassium concentration, the risk of cardiac impairment is greatest.	0.6518122866013535
Usually the cooperative action of several causative factors is required to bring about a hyperkalemia.	0.4469648276628868
Increasing age, diabetes mellitus, disorders of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system, high-dose antibiotics, and immunsuppressive treatments may result in hyperkalemia.	0.6410734432641161
The most important pathogenetic mechanisms are (1) renal insufficiency, (2) hyporeninemic hypoaldeosteronism, (3) tubular disorders, and (4) cellular disorders.	0.7038629200738645
Background: CMV retinitis is the most common opportunistic ocular infection and the main cause of blindness in AIDS patients with a T-helper cell count <= 50/µl.	0.7137489844136861
Cidofovir is a nucleotide analogue with a long half-life time after phosphorylation intracellularly.	0.3964524920256144
It is effective against CMV and can be given intravenously and intravitreally.	0.5396353619418689
The aim was to offer an alternative therapy for CMV retinitis to patients who could not receive standard treatment because of contraindications or refused it.	0.538463529301783
The efficacy and tolerance of intravitreal injections of cidofovir should be evaluated.	0.4786394512437627
A case of multiple eccrine spiradenomata is reported.	0.4921278436214462
One of the tumours was histopathologically associated with dermal cylindroma, and immunohistochemical studies showed that the cylindroma cells differentiate towards the secreting portion of the eccrine sweat gland.	0.5689785362213429
The relationship among multiple eccrine spiradenomata, dermal cylindroma and multiple trichoepitheliomata is discussed.	0.35454230643104684
In view of the risks of a varicella infection during pregnancy and the more and more observed severe course of infection, varicella infection has to be considered as a serious disease.	0.7344111874550999
The initial antibiotic treatment of bacterial meningoencephalitis has major implications for the course of the disease.	0.4761610606505504
The current spectrum of infectious agents must be considered.	0.4435689332180267
Antibiotics have to reach sufficient concentrations in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid for a bactericidal action to occur at the site of infection.	0.5291648255127606
Frequent problems arising in this condition are: (1) the non-observation of listerial infections, (2) the use of antibiotics not sufficiently active against gram-positive bacteria in pneumococal meningitis, (3) the development of meningitis following the use of ciprofloxacin in respiratory tract infections, (4) the hasty change in antibiotic regimens in focal parenchymal infections during delayed response to therapy, (5) the use of bacteriostatic antibiotics, and (6) the delay in administering sufficient antibiotic therapy during fulminate meningococcal meningitis.	0.7230550719665024
Problems arising from these conditions are illustrated by case reports.	0.3885838634178666
Therapy of rheumatoid arthritis with a combination of several disease-modifying drugs aims towards better control of the disease than achievable by monotherapy.	0.5667663495964529
Based on a broad variety of clinical studies, revealing more or less positive results, several combinations have been suggested:...	0.7042693566425002
The management of 178 patients with liver trauma (132 male, 46 female; mean age 34 years (range 3-88) presenting from January 1979 to August 1996 is reviewed.	0.6172943530041717

The postoperative complication rate was 55 %.	0.5427401229890922
The most-frequent postoperative complications related to the hepatic injury were intrahepatic or subcapsular hematoma (12.9 %) and postoperative bleeding (9.6 %).	0.7381878063008229
Intraabdominal abscess formation was seen in 2.8 %.	0.6578102450734119
Operative therapy for liver injuries depends on the grade of the injury.	0.5687891552938755
The majority of liver injuries can be managed by simple techniques, including electrocautery and application of hemostatic agents.	0.6363157578707644
In complex injuries hepatotomy, direct vessel ligation, and debridement of necrotic tissue is the method of choice (Pachter's procedure).	0.5563453465074266

A total of 93.1% of respondents would refer patients with oral lesions.	0.5831693957068621
Only 35% take a regular history of both tobacco and alcohol consumption and 26.6% explain the side effects of tobacco.	0.5555585700531017
Some 73.4% believed that the dentist could play a role in anti-tobacco counselling.	0.44423667400522665
Limiting factors were lack of training and of competence in anti-tobacco counselling.	0.38420106149745703
Conclusions: This study shows that there still is a considerable need for improvement of knowledge and for provision with effective anti-tobacco teaching material.	0.5888543689524806
Since most of the respondents thought that the dentist should play a role in anti-tobacco counselling, adequate programmes in Germany should be inititated and followed up.	0.5537824023513868
Background: Last year's pilot study, which examined for the first time a representative group of patients with Chagas disease, showed that in this parasitosis changes in the ocular fundus can be expected in the form of defects of the retinal pigment epithelium.	0.7604986724993863
Examination of more patients in this study should give further information about the character and extent of the alterations found.	0.6389303881346896
The posterior luxation of the shoulder joint is a rarely reported and often not recognized lesion in the clinical workday.	0.7510849797266302
The authors present the first case of a posterior luxation of the shoulder joint in combination with an contralateral anterior shoulder joint fracture dislocation.	0.6429892832463676
In that case the authors stress the importance of an exact clinical and radiology diagnostic and the right way to reduce a posterior luxation of the shoulder joint.	0.5377552701688624
Finally they draw the readers attention to operative steps to prevent a reluxation of the shoulder joint.	0.4470189267568078
Magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) has become the most important method in the workup of infantile cerebral complications after primary sonography.	0.7219222038078743
Cerebral MR examination and image interpretation during the infantile period require extensive knowledge of morphological manifestations, their pathophysiological background, and frequency.	0.5649937390111954
The choice of imaging parameters and image interpretation is demonstrated in infarctions and hemorrhages of the mature and immature brain.	0.4612477007769679
A review of the main differential diagnoses is also given.	0.6883027046769493
The relevance of MR spectroscopy and fetal MRI is discussed.	0.377736369375161
Currently laparoscopic surgery is limited by several factors.	0.5365276674047338
One of them is the precise handling of optics.	0.46922540181910827
Up to now, in our hospital 52 laparoscopic operations have been done with a voice - controlled robot arm to handle the optics in gallbladder, stomach, large bowel and hernia operations.	0.6965588597892898
The visual field is determined by the surgeon.	0.6642607126388491
In all cases handling of the robot arm was precise and the voice response exact and without technical problems.	0.49267787227203924
Twenty-nine operations were done by one operator as "solo surgeries".	0.49188664055710035
In 20 further cases there was one assistant.	0.5500171962059417
A robot arm can be used successfully without problems by any laparoscopic surgeon in any operating theater.	0.5162863779708443
Urine specimens were collected from 49 persons up to 10 days after abstaining from cannabis use.	0.5363079289485669
Urine samples (n = 135) were investigated for free and conjugated 9-carboxy-11-nor tetrahydrocannabinol (THCCOOH) by LC/MS/MS and for free and glucuronidated tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and 11-hydroxy-THC (11-OH-THC) by GC/MS prior to and after enzyme hydrolysis.	0.6763268549717005
Concentrations for free and conjugated THCCOOH were measured with reference to 100 mg creatinine/dL urine.	0.5209663435525855
Cannabis use was classified as light, moderate and heavy according to the current literature.	0.5837830841454716
In all groups chosen free and bound THCCOOH was present in urine samples on the day of the last use and on the next day.	0.6882601447339233
Urine samples from occasional and frequent users generally differed in the amount of THCCOOH and THCCOOH glucuronide.	0.3399478821934689
Within 4-6 days the concentrations of free and glucuronidated THCCOOH in urine samples of heavy users decreased to those ranges present in urine samples of moderate and light users.	0.5572995629296502
In frequent users, THC glucuronide and 11-OH-THC glucuronide could be found up to 1 and 3 days after abstinence, respectively.	0.5728077176320935
In light users, neither THC glucuronide nor 11-OH-THC glucuronide was detectable.	0.4121130097772329
The determination of conjugated THC and 11-OH-THC in addition to free and bound THCCOOH is suggested as an aid in assessing the frequency of cannabis use, but is limited to samples obtained within a few days after the last consumption.	0.6687408557708466
The participation of social work in inpatient psychiatric care is generally considered necessary, but there is a lack of empirical studies in this field.	0.7294421739216579
The analyses presented of a systematic documentation of social work interventions in 2038 cases during an 11-year period demonstrate that social workers are mostly involved in the treatment of chronic and previously treated patients.	0.6357340665773352
Interventions in younger patients, most of whom are suffering from psychoses, aim at rehabilitation through activity; in elderly patients with organic or depressive disorders, the major concern is to improve posthospital care; patients with neurotic or personality disorders comprise another group with a chronic course and a relatively poor outcome.	0.6670061997348711
As far as their goals are comparable, social workers and doctors agree on their objectives.	0.5485918713253773
Social workers usually see their own interventions as successful, but patient groups who benefit greatly can be differentiated from groups with poor outcome.	0.5013754972909331
Stiff-man syndrome is a rare disorder of the central nervous system characterized by muscular rigidity and superimposed spasms.	0.6343232151988305
The etiology is still unknown and an autoimmune cause is discussed.	0.540962732651831
Many differential diagnoses of muscular rigidity and of induration of the skin have to be considered.	0.6655614914862339
A 22 year old patient was admitted under suspicion of a stiff-man syndrome.	0.5465090356466129
He has had developed a painful rigidity of the trunk, starting in the neck.	0.5879585861134439
Massive stiffness of the trunk with pale appearance of the skin and a beginning disorder of swallowing and respiration were observed.	0.631879010072809
Clinical investigation, EMG, cerebrospinal fluid and laboratory findings were all normal, thus excluding a stiff-man syndrome and other neuromuscular diseases.	0.5328969122153849
Skin biopsy showed typical changes of Buschke's scleredema adultorum, a rare connective tissue disorder of unknown etiology.	0.5400742786468589
Therapy with corticosteroide and ciclosporin led to a mild improvement of symptoms.	0.3678100437510116
Although rare, Buschke's scleredema adultorum should be regarded as a differential diagnosis of the stiff man syndrome.	0.5587058383747399
Urogenital infections are established as hazards to male fertility.	0.3040909364280181
Various pathophysiological hypotheses have evolved from experimental and clinical studies, facilitating explanation of the effects of bacteria and immunological events on reproductive tissues.	0.542442787150663
Numerous current studies have identified and evaluated infectious mediators accounting for specific molecular events in urogenital infections.	0.3777573267596803
Valuable studies can be expected to appear in the future due to improvements in diagnostic procedures and new classifications of urogenital infections.	0.6553741741711211
X-ray or CT images allow only a limited three-dimensional orientation in presurgical planning.	0.5780664631831933
Especially for the planning of internal hemipelvectomies with custom-made endoprosthesis and for periacetabular osteotomies a high-grade orientation is necessary.	0.5901868480053668
This orientation is improved by a 3D CT-controlled manufactured 1:1 model of the pelvis.	0.6165810331408059
This enables an exact classification of defect and deformity, planning of resection planes, design of the suitable custom-made implant and simulation of the operation technique as preoperative quality control.	0.5148877782720337
An Ivalon-plug (PDA-plug) has been developed for transvenous closure of patent ductus arteriosus.	0.5536712467205641
It can be introduced into the ductus through standard venous sheaths with a diameter von 8-16 French.	0.5432742564957884
The plug is fixed in its target position by means of four distal (aortal) and two proximal (pulmonary) nitinol struts.	0.5129564511901163
In case of malpositioning the system can be pulled back into and retrieved through the sheath.	0.4106815021524033
In animal experiments endothelialization of the implanted material was demonstrated.	0.44757572323164063
PDA-closure was attempted in 58 patients; the procedure was successful in 57 cases; a residual ductal flow was present in eight patients.	0.6684017623681181
During a follow-up of up to 24 months there were no complications.	0.7144807433467903
Using 8 different monoclonal antibodies, immunohistology was performed on 36 follicular adenomas and on 28 follicular, 34 papillary, 27 medullary and 29 anaplastic carcinomas of the thyroid.	0.5426945537590461
The panel of antibodies was directed against broad-spectrum cytokeratins (pan-CK, antibody lu-5), against basic and acid high-molecular-weight CK of types  1, 5, 10 and 14, against basic ( 5 and 6) and acid high-molecular-weight CK ( 13) and against basic ( 7 and  8) and acid low-molecular-weight CK ( 19 and  20).	0.7594700919303838
With the exception of a large number of anaplastic carcinomas, nearly all other tumours exhibited strong immunoreactivity with antibodies against pan-CK, CK 8 and CK 19.	0.44849093045826066
CK 20 expression was exclusively shown for 2 medullary carcinomas.	0.31446872559412103
Reactivity for high-molecular-weight CK could only, each time focally, be demonstrated for 14 papillary and 2 follicular carcinomas and for 2 anaplastic carcinomas with partial squamous differentiation.	0.5545208918047098
Thirteen anaplastic carcinomas were not decorated by any of the CK antibodies applied.	0.3801511219857369
CK 7 staining exceeding the staining of individual cells was observed in 26 papillary cancers.	0.4563017385728196
In contrast, such a finding could only be obtained with each one follicular adenoma, medullary carcinoma and anaplastic carcinoma and with 5 follicular carcinomas.	0.611690341875085
These results confirm earlier studies in that CK 20 expression among thyroid tumours is restricted to the neuroendocrine medullary carcinomas and that in a larger percentage of anaplastic thyroid carcinomas an epithelial phenotype can not be demonstrated even upon using broad-spectrum CK antibodies.	0.5192083953453256
New is the finding that there exist considerable differences between papillary carcinomas and all other non-papillary thyroid tumours regarding CK 7 expression.	0.4251051447332926
This result might be of differential diagnostic value for the distinction of follicular and papillary thyroid neoplasias which sometimes have an overlapping histological pattern.	0.46273017814359835
Purpose: To compare reading speed and reading comfort between closed-circuit television systems (CCTVs) with different image refresh rates.	0.6273814937394603
This surveillance study presents a literature review concerning the very inhomogeneous care emphasis of the acute psychosocial crisis both with respect to crisis insight and therapy methods and to professional responsibility.	0.47823960331361753
In detail general care models of psychotherapeutic crisis intervention are described, as well as disorder- and event-specific concepts and papers on crisis intervention with children, teen-agers, and adolescents of the last 10 years.	0.5457515023765721
In addition, the contributions of the empirical psychotherapy research and their results are presented as far as they are relevant to crisis intervention.	0.6348531071664009
In recent years many different systems for transcatheter closure of an atrial septal defect (ASD) have been developed and tested.	0.6571496457071944
However, all systems presently available have some special disadvantages.	0.5464713592258509
The recently introduced Amplatzer Septal Occluder (ASO), though, appears promising.	0.4197551629983373
It is a self-expanding and self-centering double disc made from a Nitinol mesh, which is tightly woven to give mechanical strength.	0.5524889270468305
Both discs are separated by a connecting cylindrical portion.	0.2876943902245305
Its diameter may be chosen, so that it corresponds to that of the ASD.	0.6106640880465295
In the light of recent research findings the inappropriateness of many commonly accepted concepts in psychosomatic medicine is discussed.	0.39000296666101386
They do not stand up to empirical scrutiny.	0.4203309233402669
This applies both to sepcifity models and to duality of body and mind or of illness and health.	0.4130367242628794
The monocausal-psychogenetic view was replaced through a complex interplay of hierarchie somato-psychic circles which are to be integrated into a biosemiotic model.	0.3911731348920142
In terms of the self-object-body system a greater significance is attached to affects in the communication and acting receives an important interactive function.	0.42043397861288634
The effects of the altered theroretical positions on new therapy approaches are discussed.	0.4598697577648779
Perioperative, mostly silent ischaemia in patients with coronary heart disease is difficult to detect by clinical examinations.	0.6932150795655817
Herpes simplex viruses are known to be among the most common disease-causing microorganisms.	0.6251358773541201
Their prevalence can exceed 90% depending on the socioeconomic status of the population.	0.4635690789047873
Since the number of immunocompromised patients has increased because of the increased incidence in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and an increase in organ transplantation, herpes virus infection may have a greater clinical significance.	0.5859120690222804
While treatment of otherwise healthy individuals will not usually cause any clinical problems herpes infection in an immunocompromised patient can have severe consequences.	0.41061346243997826
Additionally, development of viral resistance can be observed that may require alternative drugs in treatment.	0.5875542314271847
We present a case history of a man with a B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia that was associated with a very unusual herpes simplex virus infection in the nasal vestibule.	0.7957116473507797
Possible causes for the development of resistance in herpes infections and the use of famciclovir and forscarnet as two therapeutic alternatives to aciclovir are discussed.	0.37542270986094456
Tumor invasion of the portal vein by ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head is classically known as a criterion for inoperability.	0.4667056918804063
Despite improvement in operation techniques for portal vein resection during Whipple's procedure and acceptable mortality and morbidity, in the case of uncertain tumor infiltration vascular resection cannot be recommended in general.	0.5645831375896263
The problem is the preoperative detection of tumor infiltration of the portal vein.	0.6576631638859013
Often the surgeon is confronted with unsuspected macroscopic portal vein infiltration or tumor adhesion during the operation.	0.4394939206844162
Between 1986 and 1995 105 patients underwent Whipple's procedure for ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head in our department.	0.4495199857862518
In eight of these cases partial portal vein resection was performed because of macroscopic tumor infiltration or tumor adhesion.	0.5919002510598788
In all eight cases the preoperative diagnostic procedures with CT and portography did not show any suspicion of tumor infiltration.	0.5776256751587442
In four of the eight cases histological tumor infiltration of all vascular layers was found.	0.47473811285388556
In the others we found no or only adventitial tumor invasion.	0.538268560392294
The patients without tumor infiltration of the portal vein showed a survival time after surgery of 27.78 months in contrast to 6.67 months in the group with histologically proven tumor infiltration.	0.7089875034205423
Endovascular, intraportal ultrasound (IPEUS), a new diagnostic procedure, can give helpful information regarding portal vein involvement.	0.6041917971047072
Although the IPEUS is not a standard diagnostic procedure it was shown to detect portal vein infiltration with high sensitivity and specificity.	0.6932397888316719
Our results indicate that in such cases where portal vein infiltration has been excluded by IPEUS, patients with macroscopic tumor adhesion do benefit from partial portal vein resection.	0.5571247603751058
Progression in medical research and economic needs require new planning and organization of treatment strategies.	0.3710860353181553
This does also apply for stroke treatment: New pathophysiological knowledge, positive results of thrombolytic therapy and the demostrated importance of early treatment at Stroke Units justify that stroke must be regarded as an emergency.	0.5866756309858938
Timing is of utmost importance.	0.23455272578265993
Time-based management serves as a planning model for a new stroke treatment strategy.	0.4481776967883171
The treatment process is divided into three phases: alarming, pre-hospital and in-hospital phase.	0.6109896750557952
The effectiveness of each of these phases is influenced by several variables (personnel, technical equipment, course of the disease, etc.).	0.5903773234304893
Knowledge of each separate phase helps to discover weaknesses, which allows an aimed improvement, e.g.	0.5334712051899214
public education, training of paramedics and medical personnel.	0.457185201792973
Modern communication systems allow new information transfer, which can help to avoid unnecessary transport of patients.	0.7767172255011429
Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) is a severe complication after heart valve replacement.	0.6478838578938035
Incidence ranges in literature between 0.1% and 2.3% (mean 0.4%) per patient year (pty).	0.8494849313188503
PVE is classified as "early" or "late" (occurence within or after 60 days following heart valve replacement).	0.5890605230939859
In this review we present the clinical outcome of PVE as well as the most common diagnostic criteria (Duke criteria), the potential etiologies and the most frequent bacteria.	0.914595504248396
The spectrum of therapeutical alternatives is discussed and a special attention is directed to the development of prevention standards.	0.5494755688211324
Recently intra-atrial defibrillation has become an interesting alternative to external defibrillation and drug therapy for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.	0.5758163198985291
Low-energy intra-atrial defibrillation can be used to restore sinus rhtyhm f.ex.	0.6290241911736644
after a failed external cardioversion or during an electrophysiologic study when the administration of antiarrhythmic drugs should be avoided.	0.4560294944198243
Additionally this new technique has led to the development of implantable atrial defibrillators for the treatment of selected patients suffering from chronic atrial fibrillation.	0.5510239161034002
Intra-atrial defibrillation seems to be a highly effective and safe method, but little experience exists concerning the outcome so far.	0.696854642154592
Especially the potential risk of inducing ventricular proarrhythmia is subject of current controversy.	0.39256480668244703
Modern imaging techniques are a substantial part of treatment planning for minimally invasive radiotherapeutic procedures.	0.5421404040958699
The aim is three-dimensional assessment of the target volume and adjacent critical structures.	0.7043879270245368
In this paper, we report on our clinical experience with a precise system for stereotactic image correlation.	0.8111925248781201
Hereby, the advantages of each imaging modality can be combined.	0.6394722838658067
Precise immobilization of the patient is a prerequisite.	1.0322259261388487
The immobilization method has an accuracy of less than 1 mm.	0.4917069332380923
This method was evaluated in a clinical study in which a tumor control rate of 93 % was achieved in patients with brain metastases after stereotactic single high dose radiotherapy.	0.8525754970583862
This indicated the excellent reliability of this treatment planning method.	0.4801479170457412
The integration of functional image information, such as blood flow or activation of cerebral cortical areas, will be evaluated in the future.	0.5861663418873729
Olfactory dysfunction seems to be one of the most frequent symptoms in idiopathic parkinsonian syndrome (IPS).	0.5625305337228612
In contrast to the increasing number of studies providing evidence of the usefulness of olfactory tests in the diagnosis of IPS, clinical assessment of olfactory function is rarely performed.	0.6380356418675452
This may be due to the lack of an easy-to-use,  inexpensive, standardized, and reliable test.	0.7220079706698899
In this study, we administered the newly developed "sniffin' sticks" test to a group of 40 nondemented IPS patients and compared the results with 40 healthy controls matched for age, gender, and smoking habits.	0.6705327394283396
In all three subtests including odor identification, odor detection threshold, and odor discrimination, the control group scored significantly better than the IPS group, yielding a specificity and sensitivity of 90% each.	0.6311416484152426
Our results indicate that olfactory disturbances in IPS can be found at early stages of the disease, appear bilaterally, and do not correlate with the dominant side of parkinsonism.	0.6349931413095345
Therefore, we emphasize that olfactory testing may be a useful tool in the diagnosis of IPS.	0.8600555496187139
Purpose: The goal of this exemplary study was to integrate morphological and functional MRI to establish computer-based, preoperative therapy planning for tumors, instancing cervical carcinoma.	0.6324485153363828
Drug-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare but frequently lethal disease of the skin and mucosa of unknown etiology.	0.8438813100587638
Toxic metabolic and immunologic products in the serum have been discussed as possible causes.	0.474733979963908
For this reason we have performed plasmapheresis on these patients for many years.	0.652880966479948
Results regarding survival and healing of the lesions are quite favorable, as exemplified with two patients described here who benefited from the procedure despite their old age.	0.6179755681300347
In order to gain insight into possible disease mechanisms that would explain the beneficial effect of plasmapheresis, we did immunohistochemical studies on these patients before and in one case after the procedure.	0.678779184579642
In dermis and epidermis, there was a striking increase of macrophages and a relative increase of CD8-positive lymphocytes which might act as cytotoxic effector cells; these findings can be interpreted as the result of an immunological reaction.	0.6387217593747058
An increased staining of lesional epidermis with TNF, as previously noted by other autors, should be interpreted with caution since necrotic cells are involved.	0.5029930034798025
On the basis of the clinical results, the pathogenetic considerations, and in view of the lack of specific treatment modalities, clinical studies concerning plasmapheresis for the treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis are recommended, particularly since this procedure is widely available and generally well tolerated.	0.82393374643587
The majority of inflammatory frontal sinus diseases requiring operative intervention can now be managed successfully by endonasal surgery.	0.4904596212985794
In problematic cases, however, optimal exposure of the entire frontal sinus and possibly complete mucous membrane removal combined with sinus obliteration must be achieved.	0.47014463347848284
In these cases, external frontal sinus surgery is indicated.	0.6339151666349524
Impaction of an intramedullary nail during extraction is an unpredictable and delicate situation.	0.3154728353734508
Its problematic nature is unfolded on a report of two cases, one with a Küntscher nail and one with a modern solid titanium nail.	0.5704402959683779
This event is caused by ingrowth of new bone formation into the slot or the dorsal flute respectively.	0.46877108133915846
The new bone formation is a mechanical barrier which effectively forces the distal part of the nail to jam against the cortex.	0.5192586216376033
Both, the slot of the unlocked reamed clover leaf nail and the wider dorsal flute of the solid titanium nail, realize certain therapeutic concepts.	0.43126955989116433
Their factual benefit within the concept of interlocking nailing is doubtful.	0.29277478027174986
Primary intracranial germ cell tumors are rare neurological diseases.	0.4410217485707233
Secreting germ cell tumors that predominantly appear in the pineal region are characterized by elevated levels of -HCG and AFP in CSF.	0.5073010284375054
Adequate diagnostic and therapeutic regimens of these tumors are still under debate.	0.6712845249020298
We present the case of a patient suffering from spinal metastasis of a secreting germ cell tumor with raised levels of -HCG in CSF.	0.6245231130256612
Six years before, a pineocytoma of intermediate differentiation had been diagnosed by stereotaxic biopsy.	0.5410249904975889
This demonstrates the importance of an early detection of a germ cell neoplasm in case of midline-sized brain-tumors by evaluation of -HCG and AFP in CSF and serum.	0.6347161096566426

With the availability of modern imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), diagnostic options in the evaluation of Marfan patients have been improved profoundly.	0.5396291315855737
The most recent diagnostic advances comprise noninvasive tissue characterization of the aortic wall, immunofluorescence studies or pulse chase analyses of skin and cultured dermal fibroblasts, and molecular analysis at the cDNA/DNA level of the fibrillin-1 gene.	0.5954280496883889
New diagnostic insights have eventually led to revised nosologic criteria for the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome.	0.4031062328036549
The diagnostic reliability as well as the advantage and limitation of these recent diagnostic strategies are discussed: moreover diagnostic concepts for patients with neonatal as well as classic Marfan syndrome are presented and discussed in the context of the clinical management during adolescence, gravidity as well as in the pre- and postoperative patient.	0.711711374924544
Primary defects of skeletal growth and development can be subdivided into hypoplasias, dysostoses and dysplasias.	0.35553317943194096
Hypoplastic bones are small but otherwise normal.	0.23284064863922488
Generalized skeletal hypoplasias comprise various forms of primordial dwarfism and syndromal disorders including trisomy 21 and Ullrich-Turner syndrome.	0.2568979913878333
Dysostoses are defects of bones as organs resulting from errors of morphogenesis.	0.31194644788522835
Many of them are caused by mutations of single genes in the cascade of morphogenetic gene sequences.	0.5130602409723246
Dysplasias are defects of bone as tissue.	0.29561450529341093
Some of them (e. g. achondroplasia, Jansen type of metaphyseal chondrodysplasia) are caused by defects of signal genes influencing cell division or differentiation.	0.5087632588073573
Others result from gene mutations affecting the cellular production of matrix components.	0.32448320667529446

In absence of significant symptoms and signs, the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) remains difficult.	0.6741266701171708
Sensitivity and specifity of laboratory tests, chest X-ray, and ECG on their own is low.	0.6305406754831002
Echocardiography is particularly useful in critically ill patients suspected of having pulmonary emboli and can help identify right ventricular pressure overload.	0.5232181500773214
Venous ultrasonography is useful in patients with suspected PE, but normal results do not rule out PE.	0.6217490610006788
Helical CT with contrast medium can identify pulmonary emboli.	0.333793227594653
However, if the CT findings are normal in the presence of a high index of clinical suspicion, only larger pulmonary embolism are ruled out, and angiography with the focus on distal pulmonary vasculature should be performed.	0.7239367088875144
The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism should be made by combining clinical assessment, several diagnostic techniques, and finally pulmonary angiography in doubtful cases.	0.7498509211562578

Pridie introduced the principle of drilling exposed subchondral bone with the objective of encouraging a fibro-cartilaginous repair.	0.4103439190708634
The newly formed fibrocartilaginous layer that develops over the lesion in osteoarthritis may be enough to decrease patients symptoms.	0.41795190550545025
Bone drilling into the subchondral layer is also effective in promoting healing of osteochondrosis dissecans.	0.4188821643545468
The choice of the treatment should be based on factors such as age of the patient, serverity of symptoms, activity level and functional demands on the joint, site and stage of the lesion.	0.7199557321101622
The drilling operation remains useful in osteoathritis and osteochondrosis dissecans.	0.23578424468728487
Recent immunobiological findings together with advances in biotechnology, ameliorations in clinical trial design, and MRI developments have led to a variety of therapeutical approaches in multiple sclerosis (MS).	0.47523201272218235
However, in contrast to successfully introduced new treatments, a number of therapeutical failures exist as well: despite impressive data from animal models, convincing concepts, and promising phase I/II studies, some investigated drugs and strategies showed no positive effects in clinical trials, or trials had to be terminated because of unexpected side effects.	0.6493498627370027
This article provides an overview of clinical studies that have failed or been abandoned for other reasons.	0.5008624101004329
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -antagonists which have led to negative effects in two studies (Lenercept, Infliximab) are discussed in detail.	0.7930890203813379

Isolated pancreatic metastases from renal-cell carcinomas (RCC) are extremely rare.	0.53126297299511
Only 96 cases of clinically diagnosed renal-cell carcinoma metastatic to the pancreas have been reported in the world literature, and 70 of the patients (including ours) underwent a definitive surgical resection.	0.7901804075473395
In many cases the time between the nephrectomy and diagnosis of metachronous metastases is reported to exceed 10 years.	0.6067142991558381
Therefore, the initial diagnosis may be overlooked when there is a prolonged disease-free interval.	0.8368247900422108
When it does occur simultaneously or metachronously, aggressive surgical resection, when possible, seems to be the most effective treatment for this metastatic lesion.	0.7184641921008524
Surgical resection can provide long-term survival in selected cases.	0.6045142146666467
We present the case of a 69-year-old woman in whom two pancreatic metastases were treated by a left-sided subtotal pancreatectomy with splenectomy, 12 years after radical nephrectomy for a RCC.	0.6795168036099495
The patient simultaneously presented with both a mass in the body of the pancreas and a right-sided colon cancer.	0.6097573364563363
Thus, the diagnosis of pancreatic metastasis of colon cancer was suspected initially.	0.6927807787893945
Both tumors were radically resected, and histological examination revealed two pancreatic metastases from the previous RCC.	0.712426699129982
In the world literature this report represents the eighth case of multiple pancreatic metastases due to RCC.	0.47837058605379046
It illustrates a rare indication of pancreatic resection because of pancreatic metastasis.	0.4121343367236249
The need for prolonged follow-up of patients is emphasized.	0.8388882674067352
The few reports on surgically treated pancreatic metastases from RCC are reviewed after the presentation of this case.	0.5336165683479382
Delusion is understood to mean intersubjectively disconcerting convictions with a tendency toward subjective certainty that lose their disconcerting character when made the object of psychiatric analysis in the knowledge of their independence from mental disorder.	0.4104320318542695
The perceptions from which delusions arise are dynamically charged according to their role in the structural context.	0.4627503237345513
The realisation pressure that burdens the perceptions and is intensified in psychotic constitutions is a precondition for the delusion.	0.2931654049474966
The failure of derealisation brought about by the psychotic disorganisation of the structure is also a requirement.	0.544084896836337
Based on a case study, considerations arising out of the initial stages of schizophrenic delusion are extended to other forms of delusion and to the conditions for chronification.	0.7272507881862843
High-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) is a promising treatment for patients with germ cell tumours and a poor prognosis.	0.7890788921549929
The selection of patients who may profit from this intervention is challenging for the urologist, as the indication has to be carefully established.	0.7721612830158722
Exclusion criteria primarily concern impaired organ functions.	0.17568925203490743
Prior to HDCT haematopoietic stem cells are obtained after the administration of conventional-dose chemotherapy plus G- or GM-CSF stimulation.	0.5647776803430499
HDCT consists of a combination of carboplatin, etoposide and ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide.	0.35527033624379334
After HDCT, haematologic monitoring and maximal supportive care are essential.	0.2800446100933
It is therefore recommended that HDCT only be administered at specialized centres.	0.4171408136742994
Pyoderma gangrenosum develops in most patients between the age of 25 and 54 years.	0.584819362034159
It usually occurs in otherwise healthy persons or in association with a systemic desease.	0.5051996955240242
Several clinical variants of pyoderma gangrenosum have been described.	0.4257561004934898
Extremely painful ulcerations are characteristic and evolve rapidly.	0.26627059653832297
Malignant pyoderma, the variant described in our case report, is an aggressive variant of ulcerative pyoderma gangrenosum, rapidly progressive and a potentially lethal ulcerative disease.	0.6670593892762291
The diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum depends on recognition of the evolving clinical features because histopathologic changes are not specific and characteristically serological or hematological markers of the disease do not exist.	0.5973643597502287
Histopathologic findings, however, always include vasculitis, either in form of the necrotizing cutaneous vasculitis (7), granulomatous (1) or lymphocytic vasculitis (2).	0.6312436319477749
We report on a 36-year-old male patient, who underwent surgery for repair of an aneurysm of the aortic arch.	0.8800481953551738
The aneurysm occurred two months after exacerbation of a malignant variant of pyoderma gangrenosum with nearly lethal exit.	0.5711417968866039
An association of pyoderma gangrenosum with vasculitis has been described previously, but the present report is the first to describe an aortic arch aneurysm which seems to be associated with necrotizing angiitis of the vasa vasorum caused by a pyoderma gangrenosum.	0.7357392964881573
We could demonstrate successful perioperative treatment for prevention of exacerbation of pyoderma gangrenosum with prednisone and clofazimine	0.4519835882522271
Background and purpose: To test the association of cardiac sources of embolism with territorial type brain infarcts.	0.5265962298572753
Defects of the dorsal and ventral ligament complexes of the lumbar spine results to an instability of the functional spinal unit.	0.592983164480266
For the prognosis of secondary instability due to disko-ligamentous injuries the functional insufficiency of the lasting scars is a larger problem than the primar loss of osseous stability with fast healing tendency.	0.4641720250838296
The main goal of the present biomechanical study in vitro was to demonstrate the different grades of instability in the correlation to progressive disko-ligamentous defects as well as stabilisation through dynamic and static procedures.	0.5930468714519775
With a transpedicular screw-ringband-system the segmental function was preserved and instability was abolished.	0.36736812124139884
After rigid instrumentation with a fixateur intern remained a residual range of motion due to which can result refuse to bending moments without spondylodesis in an implant failure.	0.43952092559543027
CT- or MRI-guided stereotactic procedures should be a standard in a modern neurosurgical unit.	0.6511081892841809
Analysing 71 cases the indications and results of stereotactic neurosurgery are presented.	0.4955108303194163
In 53 patients stereotactic serial biopsies of different intraaxial lesions were performed, in 5 patients a spontaneous haemorrhage of the basal ganglia was removed by lysis with r-tPA.	0.5862804602406972
In 3 patients suffering from hydrocephalus due to diencephalic cysts a cystventricular shunt device was implanted.	0.3743672835729659
In 3 patients an intracerebral abscess was aspirated and drained.	0.4727005883477455
A stereotactic guided craniotomy and excision of small deep-seated lesions was performed in 6 cases.	0.5529177281262702
The accuracy of stereotactic tumour biopsies was 88.7 % in our series, in accordance to other authors.	0.8610006082769673
The stereotactic aspiration and drainage of an intracerebral abscess provides accurate localization and minimal cortical damage and offers the possibility of intracavitary application of antibiotics.	0.47233348447671386
The stereotactic internal shunt implantation seems to be an alternative approach in the treatment of diencephalic cysts due to its minimal invasiveness and low operative risk.	0.610397606124432
The aspiration of basal ganglia haematomas with insertion of an external drainage allows the lysis of the haematoma with r-tPA or urokinase.	0.3911963004301757
With stereotactic guidance small, deep-seated intraaxial lesions can be well localized and removed.	0.4157782790954132
Radiotherapy of patients with prostate cancer offers an alternative to radical prostatectomy in early stages (T1-T2).	0.6631106466350202
In locally advanced prostate cancer a high dose or combined radiotherapy is more effective than radical surgery with concurrent lower morbidity and mortality.	0.5159844211247216
Recent developments in linear accellerator technique, the progress in dose calculation and planning techniques provide the means to apply higher doses to a given tumor volume while effectively protecting the surrounding normal tissue at the same time.	0.5021908530540993
These improvements may possibly reduce the rate of therapy related side effects or complications significantly.	0.3735248028311186
The combination of external beam radiotherapy and interstitial brachytherapy as well as the combination of hormone therapy and external beam radiotherapy are most likely more effective than percutaneous irradiation alone.	0.586202345632002
In special cases with a very low risk of recurrent tumor an interstitial permanent brachytherapy alone is indicated.	0.7565410760726112
Future developments (i. e. intensity modulated radiotherapy - IMRT, combined thermo-radiotherapy, proton- or neutrontherapy) may further increase the rate of curative treatments in patients with prostate cancer.	0.655755790791526
Skin is the second most common site of extranodal lymphoma.	0.3652289826797863
The significance of cutaneous B-cell lymphomas has been underestimated due to the lack of monoclonal antibodies and molecular genetics in former years.	0.5438415522090583
Cutaneous B-cell lymphomas represent a heterogenous group of entities which show variation in histology, immunophenotype and in prognosis.	0.4435379752608374
The most common entities presenting in skin are follicular lymphomas, marginal zone B-cell lymphomas, and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.	0.614129619669683
The majority of primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas have an excellent prognosis.	0.6039716066602053
Whereas in B-cell lymphomas with secondary spread to the skin the clinical course is dependant on the prognosis of the primary lymphoma.	0.790926154014282
It is evident that primary cutaneous lymphomas are distinct from nodal lymphomas and not extranodal manifestations of their lymph-node-based counterparts.	0.4533302117885555
In the current review the morphologic spectrum of cutaneous B-cell lymphomas comprising primary and secondary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas is discussed according to the WHO classification sheme.	0.6757173477894654
The phencyclidine derivative ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist with the thalamo-neocortical projection system as the primary site of action.	0.44300699370456154
Racemic ketamine consists of the enantiomers S(+)-ketamine and R(-)-ketamine.	0.7065977594824416
Racemic ketamine has never been considered an adequate anaesthetic agent in neurosurgical patients since  it produces regionally specific stimulation of cerebral metabolism (CMRO2) and increases cerebral blood flow (CBF) and intracranial pressure (ICP).	0.5094907075349691
However, recent experiments suggest that both tracemic ketamine and S(+)-ketamine may reduce infarct size in animal models of incomplete cerebral ischaemia and brain injury.	0.5892375876791582
This experimental protective effect appears to be related to decreases in Ca++ influx and maintenance of brain tissue magnesium levels due to NMDA and quisqualate receptor blockade by ketamine.	0.3670508548835645
Studies in dogs have shown that racemic ketamine (2.0 mg/kg) increases CBF in the presence of the cerebral vasodilator N2O.	0.6266002424009259
In contrast, studies in rats without background anaesthesia showed increases in CBF after racemic ketamine (100 mg/kg i.p.).	0.5863478409744179
This suggests that the cerebrovascular effects of racemic ketamine are related to the pre-existing cerebrovascular tone induced by background anaesthetics.	0.40269120805684366
Cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity was maintained regardless of the baseline cerebrovascular resistance.	0.3650708899824098
There are several mechanisms by which racemic ketamine may increase CBF.	0.46370204167622475
It induces dose-dependent respiratory depression with consequent mild hypercapnia in spontaneously ventilating subjects.	0.3796068408251202
This produces vasodilation due to the intact cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity.	0.4078078075339517
Racemic ketamine also induces regional neuroexcitation, which leads to stimulation of cerebral glucose consumption in the limbic, extrapyramidal, auditory, and sensory-motor systems.	0.5763547361555825
This regional neuroexcitation with increased CMRO2 produces increases in CBF that can be blocked by infusion of barbiturates or benzodiazepines.	0.4260401943010542
However, increases in CBF with racemic ketamine (1 mg/kg) may also occur during normocapnia and without changes in CMRO2.	0.8235531114148243
