6.19456277203167
However, aprotinin showed a positive effect on some coagulation parameters in the reperfusion phase.	0.6433195427612197
The mechanism appeared to be inhibition of the contact activation of the intrinsic system with less thrombin generation in the study group.	6.413967876958339
Co-existing inflammation and epidermal hyperproliferation characteristic for psoriasis have been shown to be reproducible in several animal models utilizing a variety of different strategies.These models highlight some points of the multicausal pathogenesis of psoriasis.	7.482969077460268
Based on observations made in the animal models, a hypothesis is proposed for the pathogenesis of psoriasis, the elements of which can be tested in a recently established xenogeneic transplantation model.	6.135821482022073
Adipose tissue tumors are often characterized by typical or even specific chromosomal alterations.	7.822320435305029
In some of the cases the molecular background of these microscopically visible alterations was already elucidated.	6.506914706945798
In myxoid liposarcomas the translocation t(12;16) creates a fusion gene between the CHOP gene and the FUS gene and in lipomas the HMGI-C gene becomes rearrranged by structural aberrations involving chromosomal region 12q14-15.	8.597773590482078
Based on examples of a lipoma, a well-differentiated liposarcoma, a myxoid liposarcoma, and an aggressive angiomyxoma it is demonstrated in the present paper how cytogenetic investigation can be used as an additional tool for an improved diagnosis of adipose tissue tumors.	6.234013244346778
Furthermore, the detection of molecular mechanisms underlying the visible cytogenetic alterations will certainly significantly increase our knowledge about the pathogenesis of these diseases.	5.603484480559043
The primary goal of diagnostic imaging of the larynx is analysis of submucosal structures that are not visible by clinical or endoscopic means.	7.085841456265135
Therefore, image analysis of the larynx should only be performed under knowledge of the results of clinical diagnosis.	4.545794919033643
The anatomic relationships of the laryngeal skeleton, the intrinsic structures, and the surrounding soft tissue are presented synoptically.	5.9472620760852655
The pattern ERG (PERG) is used as an indicator of retinal ganglion cell function.	5.943565124623886
Up to now, reports on the reproducibility of the PERG have been contradictory.	3.156914018759558
We investigated the reproducibility under the conditions of the forthcoming ISCEV guidelines for the PERG.	6.013994362793502
We simultaneously recorded the PERG and VEP in 42 eyes of 21 subjects to phase-reversing checkerboard stimuli with DTL electrodes.	8.708186082534324
Both transient (2 rps) and steady-state (16 rps) stimulation was employed.	6.940801803469592
The check sizes were 0.4 °, 0.8 ° and 16 °, the mean luminance 45 cd/m2, the contrast 98%, and the field size 32 °x27 °.	5.683353203384799
Measurements were repeated at the same time of day after 1 week.	4.423646132229168
In addition, we compared two different electrode positions in 16 eyes: (1) across the cornea along the lower lid; and deep in the conjunctival sac.	6.3771817942597355
With position (1) the amplitudes were found to be higher by 20% than (2).	4.561443974574976
We calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) of amplitude as a measure of reproducibility.	7.505759029035009
CV was 7 +/- 1% for the steady-state PERG, 9 +/- 1% for the transient PERG, 12 +/- 2% for the steady-state VEP and 14 +/- 3% for the transient VEP.	4.426533807145507
For the latency of the PERG, the intersession CV was found to be 1.5%.	4.639188642604482
Amplitude reproducibility was somewhat higher under steady-state as compared to transient stimulation; we attribute this to the high noise rejection of the Fourier analysis.	7.484402043374045
Altogether, the amplitude reproducibility of the PERG is somewhat higher than that of the VEP.	5.307990040983778
As a result of physical violence to exposed regions of skin (beating, grabbing) it was possible to effect a mutual transfer of epithelial cells between probands.	7.549743805093777
The majority of these cells were corneocytes with a minimal incidence of nucleated stratum granulosum cells.	7.286792222478745
Punching onto foil-covered sandbags resulted in a comparable transfer of cells.	7.218812697972394
Punches afflicted to the upper arms resulted in a successful `perpetrator-victim' assignment via DNA typing.	7.740284338173588
The DNA did not only originate from the few nucleated cells but also from the corneocytes themselves, as positively confirmed by investigations of denucleated cell-suspensions.	8.130520074105744
The cell concentration achieved in model experiments, however, shows that the forensic value of such a sample is dependent on the presence of nucleated cells.	5.584600834059623
The results of this paper justify the requirement - (having weighed up the appropriate case-specific modalities) - that sampling by taking swabs of the skin regions in question must be carried out as soon as possible.	6.329884983725027
Ultrasound contrast media increase backscatter from blood thus improving the signal-to-noise-ratio.	6.616209786991509
Potential clinical applications of intravenous ultrasound contrast are reviewed.	6.837782090103353
Contrast enhancement of continous wave Doppler is indicated when the native recordings are noisy and no complete envelope of the Doppler spectrum is obtained.	8.038931326988246
In aortic stenosis several investigations showed good agreement between the gradient calculated from Doppler measurements and the results of cardiac catheterization.	7.573661247049187
In mitral insufficiency maximum area of the regurgitant jet is a widely used parameter for estimation of the severity of the regurgitation.	6.103603710023302
However, assessment of the maximum jet area may be not possible because poor acoustic windows.	5.191861676651485
Contrast enhancement provides complete display of the regurgitant jet in most of the patients.	6.058363829664976
The diagnostic confidence of the Doppler investigation is further improved by the recording of the pulmonary venous flow, which can be recorded in most of the patients following injection on contrast.	5.897579966218728
Therefore contrast enhanced transthoracic Doppler is an alternative to transesophageal Doppler investigation in patients with poor transthoracic windows.	7.36025716410964
Since 1993 a report card system for fractures of the neck of the femur has been established in the Department of External Quality Assurance of the Chamber of Physicians of Westphalia-Lippe.	5.309710662374616
Several indicators of good quality have changed significantly since then: conservative treatment decreased from 6.8 % in 1993 to 4.2 % in 1997, lethality decreased from 6.9 % to 5.4 %, average length of stay decreased from 30.9 days to 24.9 days, average length of stay before operation decreased from 2.6 to 2.1 days, the frequency of operations on weekends increased, complications in wound healing increased from 4.9 to 6.0 %, and cardiopulmonary complications decreased from 11.2 % to 7.8 %.	5.31253325417375
Between 1993 and 1997, 54.3 % were dismissed to go home; the percentage of patients sent to rehabilitation facilities after acute care rose from 8.3 % in 1993 to 20.1 % in 1997.	5.301861875907803
The most frequent and still increasing procedure was implantation of hemiprosthesis/bipolar prosthesis (from 38.8 % in 1993 to 41.0 % in 1997) followed by total hip replacement (decreasing from 37.4 % in 1993 to 34.2 % in 1997).	5.249643263231429
Operative treatment was performed in more than 90 % of all fractures in all counties of Westphalia-Lippe.	4.262161551969928
However, there was a wide and significant geographical variation in the choice between osteosynthesis and hip replacement: the percentage of hip replacements differed between 57 % and 82 % among different counties.	6.623850606009943
Average length of stay before the operative procedure for patients undergoing reduction and rigid internal fixation of the fracture is still too long (1.6 days in 1997).	5.27308846448404
The etiology of os odontoideum is still controversial.	4.624436634484367
In most patients, it is found by accident because of neurological symptoms and/or painful range of motion of the cervical spine.	5.08830180713568
Upon recognition of the os odontoideum, it is unknown whether or not immediate surgery is beneficial.	6.145461578729674
This is in contrast to an "unstable" os odontoideum, which could result in atlantoaxial instability or compression of the myelon.	6.557920500947042
In this study, we present the results of our treatment of four patients with an unstable os odontoideum.	3.930462482472117
In all four cases, a C1-2 fusion was performed (3 x Magerl/Seemann, 1 Gallie-Brooks).	6.455912654951306
Postoperatively, we found a complete regression of neurological symptoms in three patients and one was significantly improved.	5.639411068450972
The range of motion of the cervical spine was free of pain in all patients.	2.6845269131226526
As a result, we strongly support immediate surgical treatment of an unstable os odontoideum in order to prevent severe and life-threatening neurological complications.	5.940058435906372
Several studies from anglo-american countries indicate that in non-psychiatric hospital departments mentally ill patients have a longer length of hospital stay than mentally well, while in Austria and Germany, until now, no studies concerning this question exist.	6.02315275436846
Therefore, we investigated the influence of psychiatric comorbidity on the length of stay in 608 patients of medical, surgical and gynecological departments in Vienna and Tyrol.	5.290127901306489
Based on the Clinical Interview Schedule, 28.1% of the patients in this sample suffered from psychiatric disorders.	4.982505324530011
The presence of psychiatric disorders, as well as type of hospital department (medical department), higher age, more previous non-psychiatric treatment periods, and more somatic diagnoses predicted a longer duration of inpatient treatment.	5.847557675908607
To avoid the influence of cofounding variables, psychiatric cases were matched with psychiatric non-cases.	6.171305896113431
The mentally ill group was treated for a markedly longer period as inpatients than the mentally well.	6.98248867232577
Patients with a diagnosis of dementia or of substance abuse showed a significantly increased length of stay, while we could not confirm this for other psychiatric diagnoses.	6.113382324139975
The development of new cardiopulmonary bypass technologies, special surgical instruments, as well as intrathoracic video systems facilitates mitral surgery via a small right thoracotomy.	6.604042587518022
Functional recovery after bilateral comminuted fractures of the humeral head with posterior dislocation is poor.	5.361077366147672
When reposition and internal fixation fail, the remaining alternatives are (hemi)arthroplasty and/or arthrodesis.	6.770763968801386
In a 50-year-old patient, we treated the dominant shoulder by arthrodesis; a Neer prosthesis was inserted at the other side.	5.648318447038338
Using this strategy, the advantages of both techniques were combined with an acceptable functional recovery, which ist especially important for young and active patients.	6.133439319068752
Commonly used regiments for gut decontamination after oral ingestion of toxic substances are induced emesis, gastric lavage and activated charcoal.	7.901100607771554
It was not until recently that the effectiveness of these procedures was studied systematically.	6.702006869360077
The results of these studies are presented and the side effects and complications of the different procedures are discussed.	3.3671729298383832
Together with the German poison control centers, guidelines for gut decontamination in pediatric patients were developed, based on the official recommendations of the European Association of Poisons Centres and Clinical Toxicologists (EAPCCT) and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology (AACT).	7.372072928938904
The methodology used to assess postoperative continence has a significant effect on the outcome of incontinence surgery.	5.951315271111698
Retrospective chart review studies consistently report higher success rates than patient questionnaire-based outcome analyses.	7.745051295956082
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the true long-term results of the Stamey bladder neck suspension procedure using an anonymous patient questionnaire.	4.823797587627608
Of 172 consecutive patients, 138 (80.2 %) returned a questionnaire on long-term continence, complications and subjective satisfaction with the operative result.	5.9037482199645686
With a mean follow-up of 66 months, 65 of 130 evaluable patients (50.0 %) remained completely continent while 15 (11.5 %) never became continent and 50 (38.5 %) had recurrent incontinence 6-90 months postoperatively.	4.845630660985402
Almost two-thirds of the patients felt either cured or substantially improved more than 5 years after surgery.	4.945522489173082
Stamey bladder neck suspension leads to a persistently improved quality of life despite a considerable failure rate.	6.869568089071375
Our study demonstrates the advantages of patient questionnaires for outcome analyses and emphasizes the need for standardisation and validation to allow comparisons between the results of different incontinence procedure in the future.	6.555657853883393
Social work for the elderly in a demographical ageing society is not justified per se, but has to prove its utility under the altering social conditions of the changing age-structure.	7.337286741873952
In the field of practice, this has led to an increasing need for professional orientation and to searching for profiles of performance with greater attraction.	6.7633644313721595
Pseudoaneurysms of the extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) can be caused by external injury or may be due to spontaneous dissection.	4.300542826379217
Pseudoaneurysms bear an increased risk of arterio-arterial embolism.	5.726896668735567
Treatment of pseudoaneurysms is influenced by the location and the type of injury, associated injurys, collaterals to the ipsilateral hemisphere, neurological signs and symptoms, growth of the lesion and patient age.	5.89365728479696
Potential treatment regimen include conservative and medical approaches with anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy, extra-intracranial bypass, resection of the pseudoaneurysm with vessel reconstruction, ligation or endovascular balloon occlusion of the ICA.	6.893183139392427
Pseudoaneurysms of the ICA adjacent to the scull base require a major surgical procedure.	7.71062655854623
If there are contraindications for vessel occlusion conservative or medical treatment used to be the only therapeutic alternatives.	6.988505557948634
We report the treatment of two patients with extracranial ICA pseudoaneurysms after blunt injury with stent placement (in one case combined with coil embolization) as a further treatment option.	6.600579038813213
Introduction: The combination of direct magnification mammography and computed radiography provides an improvement in spatial resolution of storage phosphor-based digital systems.	7.166205308144665
A clinical study comparing conventional and digital direct magnification mammograms was performed.	6.936523157286813
Methods: 100 survey mammograms in 1.5- or 1.7-fold magnification and 50 4-fold spot magnification views were obtained with a prototype direct magnification mammography system and a storage phosphor-based digital system.	7.222814507487834
An intraindividual comparison of these with previous conventional radiograms of the same patients was carried out.	6.999006789587156
Results: The diagnostic value of digital survey mammograms using the direct magnification technique is comparable to that of conventional radiograms of the breast, especially with regard to the identification of microcalcifications and lesions and the clinical consequences.	5.076710488726555
Spot magnification views performed with this combination of techniques allowed improvement in the evaluation of microcalcifications.	6.24903042092057
In 15 % of cases, diagnostic procedures were adjusted accordingly.	2.7546137051010313
Conclusion: The combination of the direct magnification technique with digital storage phosphor radiography systems allows the performance of digital mammography by improving the overall spatial resolution.	6.465147893675335
The diagnostic value of digital direct magnification survey mammograms was comparable to that of conventional mammograms.	5.321002527269996
Digital 4-fold spot magnification views improved visualisation of the morphologic aspects of microcalcifications.	7.9926043059239795
Warthin's tumour of the larynx is an unusual finding.	5.846828050438017
In present literature only four cases have been reported.	4.3285130297814565
Only one case of a woman suffering from Warthin's tumour of the protid gland and the ipsilateral site of the larynx has been published.	6.191056106620782
A case of a 74-year-old woman with an Warthin's tumour of the right parotid gland and the left false cord is presented.	5.525377529636091
The theories about the development of Warthin's tumours are discussed.	6.706149264008797
In rheumatic diseases, radiation synovectomy is a reliable method.	3.3717038319637034
Meanwhile, radiation synovectomy is an outpatient therapy.	6.131197730683986
In addition, combination with arthroscopic synovectomy is an increasing therapeutic modality.	5.96233845029513
In comparison to the hitherto inpatient modality, a greater lymphatic emigration of the radionuclide and, therefore, a higher radiation exposure is possible.	5.574826375827807
In 35 patients we found radionuclide emigration in 17 cases by whole body scintigraphy, resulting in a 50%-percentile with 68.27%-confidence interval of 1.8 (0.45-4.78)% of the injected yttrium-90-activity.	5.50810928604214
Comparison of 3 groups with the above mentioned therapy modalitites resulted in no statistical difference (p>0.05).	5.877898761321026
Because of the found radionuclide emigration, a radiation dose of 0.1 (0.05-0,18) mSv in women and 0.2 (0.1-0.38) mSv in men was calculated.	4.656657385707382
For lymph nodes, liver, spleen and whole body radiation doses of 619 (154-1644) mSv, 62 (15-165) mSv, 62 (15-165) mSv and 37 (9-99) mSv were calculated.	7.0976516681639685
Gonadal radiation dose can be neglected and the morbidity rate for tumors bacause of the whole body radiation dose is low with a value of 0.4 per thousand.	7.689820909341132
Therefore, radiation synovectomy can be used unlimited by patients age and independent of the therapeutic modality.	5.751631600132667
The goal of surgery using a thoracoscopic approach for the anterior reconstruction of fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine is the reduction of postoperative pain and morbidity.	5.7183816554547455
Fusion of the injured segment was performed by partial corporectomy and the vertebral body reconstructed using a tricortical autogenous bone graft.	6.897486990721598
A plate and screw assembly was inserted to stabilize the surgical correction.	5.01005201870872
This technique was used between May 1996 on May 1998 in 100 patients with 103 fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine.	6.232996761723993
Fractures from T4 to L3 were stabilized; most fractures occurred  at the thoracolumbar junction.	7.402826442273792
A monosegmental short fusion was given preference in 51 patients.	6.405650170063333
A dorsoventral approach was necessary in 68 patients on account  of the fracture type.	5.65154702387098
Comparing a group of 30 patients who had undergone an open procedure and a similar group treated under thoracoscopic assistance, we found a marked reduction of the postoperative need for analgesics and the duration of postoperative ventilation.	5.691457900396554
Pneumatic external counterpulsation operates by applying ECG-triggered diastolic pressure via cuffs to the vascular bed of the lower limbs.	5.952500944207492
Comparable with intra-aortic balloon pumping, PECP produces a diastolic augmentation combined with increase of mean arterial pressure and coronary perfusion.	6.9735926655587015
American, Asian, and our own data demonstrated a reduction of angina pectoris through repeated use of PECP one or two hours daily for four to seven weeks.	7.40123134824829
Exercise testing and thallium scanning confirmed the clinical improvement.	6.97793888238525
PECP is a virtually riskfree treatment option in patients suffering from angina despite medical and interventionell treatment.	6.315334947356494
Opening of collaterals and collateral growth induced by external counterpulsation are discussed as the cause of clinical benefit.	6.240044241916049
Transrectal fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of the prostate under digital control is a cheap and rapid method for diagnostic evaluation of palpable and non-palpable nodules, yielding high sensitivity (ca.	6.25481959241003
95%) and a low complication rate (<1%).	2.4825938129009617
Its specificity amounts to >97%.	5.997084906327319
The scarcity of urologists trained in the FNAB method and of pathologists experienced in cytology of the prostate limit the clinical application so far.	7.973378732640733
Besides various forms of prostatitis, five different types of cancer can cytologically be differentiated.	6.614030648676865
While PIN I cannot be cytologically identified, PIN II/III lesions may lead to false-positive diagnoses.	6.382359665935212
Cytologic grading of adenocarcinomas of the prostate is of statistically proven prognostic validity and strictly correlated with its histologic counterpart.	7.965089003113078
Preoperative, radiologically controlled FNAB of pelvic and paraortal lymph nodes has sensitivity of ca.	7.739047195836217
86% and specificity of 100%.	2.897941523314565
It thus helps to avoid unnecessary prostatectomies if nodal tumor spread has preoperatively been proven.	7.586204104703806
Diagnostic DNA cytometry is able to identify those prostatic cancer patients who do not reveal significantly increased risk of tumor progression or decreased survival probability, even without therapy (constantly and representatively diploid and tetraploid patterns).	7.053857313347206
Patients with DNA tetraplid histograms may show detoriation of prognosis under hormonal therapy.	7.762674903811236
DNA-aneuploid prostatic cancers should not be subjected to a "wait and see" strategy; they do not respond to hormonal therapy.	5.7564997187386835
Early defibrillation is the standard of care for patients with ventricular fibrillation (VF) and pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT).	2.7627585093486533
Technical developments aim at further miniaturization and simplification of defibrillators as well as adaptation of energy requirements to the patient's needs.	7.572682269922073
Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators (ICD) and automated external defibrillators (AED) are based upon the same technology.	4.642353051021018
Both devices analyze the ECG signal internally, followed by a "shock" or "no shock" decision.	5.475547267908807
Use of automated devices is the prerequisite for defibrillation by non-physicians.	7.226847343766749
Chest impedance measurements and use of alternative shock waveforms, such as biphasic, aim at adaptation of energy or current to the patient's individual needs and avoid application of unnecessarily high amounts of energy to the myocardium.	7.549434693010947
Calculation of median frequency is a non-invasive method for analyzing the heart's metabolic and electrical state.	6.355234168139586
It helps to determine the optimal moment for defibrillation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).	4.015758443619961
Developments concerning the structure of in-hospital emergency systems or pre-hospital emergency medical services (EMS) aim at further reductions in time from collapse of a patient until first defibrillation.	6.326909380710865
Such developments include early defibrillation programs for emergency medical technicians (EMT), nurses, and fire or police department first responders as well as wide distribution of easy-to-operate defibrillators in public areas, as discussed during the American Heart Association's Public Access Defibrillation conferences.	6.741332643346618
All programs of that kind have to be organized and supervised by a physician who is responsible for training and supervision of the personnel involved.	7.600160703654187
Spontaneous breathing with Biphasic Positive Airway Pressure (BIPAP) or Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV) caused a reduction in intrapulmonary shunting and dead space ventilation and improvement in arterial oxygenation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.	7.003051139161333
During spontaneous breathing with APRV/BIPAP venous return, cardiac output and oxygen delivery increased while oxygen consumption remained unchanged.	7.269407421446165
In patients early spontaneous breathing with APRV/BIPAP was associated with a better arterial oxygenation than in patients receiving controlled mechanical ventilation for 3 days and were then weaned with APRV/BIPAP.	7.333842895790332
Length of mechanical ventilation, intubation and ICU stay was shorter in patients breathing spontaneously early with APRV/BIPAP.	5.958512061343131
Therefore, early spontaneous breathing with APRV/BIPAP may be of advantage.	6.06007493508723
Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a rare but clinically distinct disorder which is easily overlooked.	6.544360505303971
It commonly occurs in older men and, because of its similarity to epileptic seizures, is often misdiagnosed.	5.391223431989942
The etiology of RBD is still unknown.	3.9130967536648216
However, there is an interesting association with Parkinson's disease which presents some pathophysiological hypotheses.	5.156372611724105
Treatment is usually successful with clonazepam.	4.839188950105446
Various therapeutic options have been proposed in the treatment of femoral head necrosis ranging from conservative management to total hip arthroplasty.	6.005622132335054
Since microsurgical techniques are routinely used in orthopaedic surgery, the importance of revascularization has increased in recent years.	4.314964593995859
Vascularized bone grafting as well as various osteotomies have been considered for the stages II and III according to Ficat and II, III and IV of the criteria of the ARCO system respectively, which also bases on MRI-findings.	5.836583260166723
We investigated the results of 80 patients with avascular necrosis of the femoral head treated with a vascular pedicled iliac bone graft, perfused by the A. circumflexa ilium profunda, between 1988 and 1996.	6.304219451548162
Mean follow-up was 5,6 years.	4.34005433886111
The evaluation was based on the harris hip score, clinical and radiological examination as well as a subjective assessment using a VAS (visual analog scale).	4.778040809343398
The clinical results according to the harris hip score were good or excellent in 86,1 %.	4.736352538087106
These results correlate with the subjective assessment of pain and of the hip joint function with an average of 7,9 points using the VAS (max.	5.281951629336903
Unchanged radiological appearance over the follow-up period was observed in 47,5 % using the ARCO criterias.	5.020113473786095
Reviewing the studies using vascularized grafts, about 50 % of the patients with a stage II and III according to Ficat and II, III and IV of the ARCO respectively show an unchanged stage of the disease 5-6 years after the procedure.	5.105495412892073
Therefore, transplantation of a vascular pedicled iliac bone graft possibly offers the chance to intervene causally in the course of the disease with only little alteration of the biomechanics of the hip joint.	5.755349027861523
This paper describes preprosthetic surgery from its historical beginnings to its present state-of-the-art status.	6.1109402930594285
Future perspectives of preprosthetic surgery are also outlined, excluding implants.	6.629320395620776
In an enquiry of 250 German-speaking maxillofacial departments, 160 responded.	6.175351184299395
Results showed that a surprising 30-50% of the institutions are still following guidelines for procedures which have been proven by scientific follow-up studies to be almost 100% unsuccessful.	5.875652564061985
This paper summarizes the results of an attempt to reconstruct the fates of Jewish pediatricians from Germany, Vienna and the German Pediatric Hospitals in Prague between 1933 and 1945.	6.944888208073728
The relevant archives in Europe, USA, Great Britain and Israel provided facts and relevant dates for 697 Jewish pediatricians who were humiliated and murdered or who emigrated.	7.115191843031669
Compared with the total number of 1361 pediatric specialists in the three areas, more than 50% of them were Jews as defined by the Nazi racial laws.	5.2542896758570965
So far, 577 cases have been cleared up: 446 of them emigrated to 31 countries; 63 became victims of the Holocaust; other individual destinies included going underground or committing suicide.	8.146262736487996
The fate of about 120 persons is still unknown.	4.943521435691137
This paper discusses the probable reasons for the high percentage of Jews in pediatrics, the anti-semitic attitude of the German Society for Pediatrics and the continual humiliation and persecution of Jewish pediatricians in the Nazi period.	6.713495652526871
We performed a prospective multi-center study in order to determine the causes of  30-day perioperative mortality.	5.3693789410945145
The implantation of a mesh is an essential step in laparoscopic inguinal hernia surgery.	6.310593484165512
We present the case of a 22-year-old man who developed an unspecific and refractory syndrome of inguinal pain after a TAPP procedure for a primary inguinal hernia.	5.129658083419834
Repeated reoperation for removement of clips and nerve transection were unsuccessful.	7.2674273141989465
By a transinguinal approach, 18 months after the first operation we removed a preperitoneal Prolene mesh which had shrunk and folded to 30 % of its original size.	6.97546162151319
The problem of biocompatibility of meshes currently used in inguinal hernia surgery is discussed.	6.199851833216119
Therapy of advanced renal cell carcinoma remains difficult.	3.65117987432092
New therapeutic schemes besides cytokine treatment should be evaluated.	5.403767628545874
The following study analyzes the in vitro toxicity of treosulfan on spheroids of 8 primary cultures of renal cell carcinoma cells.	7.009245258320652
These data were compared to the toxicity of vinblastine.	2.7256300331232794
All investigations were performed in regard to the P-glycoprotein (Pgp) expression of the cells, which is one of the main causes of multidrug resistance.	4.577059305174258
Four Pgp positive and four Pgp negative spheroids were incubated with the drugs in increasing doses.	7.7258959533586085
Toxicity was measured using the MTT toxicity assay as well as trypan blue exclusion.	6.902204820908892
Significantly higher toxicity of treosulfan compared to vinblastine could be demonstrated.	6.46898335568655
In addition, the effects of treosulfan were not related to Pgp expression.	3.7425186923238183
These results are encouraging and a phase II study analyzing the efficacy of treosulfan in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma has been initiated in our institution.	6.573433899810495
Postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy renders beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors such as blood lipids.	6.347599317160224
Additionally, direct protective mechanisms of estrogens in the blood vessels and myocardium are under study.	6.562424596341204
Recent findings suggest an improvement in endothelium-dependent vasodilatation and coronary microcirculation.	7.182242525069263
Furthermore, it has also been suggested that this treatment has cardioprotective effects on the left ventricular geometry, i.e., nomial left ventricular mass and wall thickness.	4.8200054487635535
Whether the beneficial effects of estrogens are counterregulated by a combined use with progestins is not yet known and requires further investigation.	7.427627119860306
Malaria is one of the most common infectious diseases worldwide.	3.296225255361318
Characteristic signs of malaria are special macroscopic and microscopic organ changes, which may also be seen in postmortem examinations.	5.979180683402816
Modern diagnostic tools allow a fast and reliable diagnosis.	5.13034631375613
The symptoms of malaria are rather unspecific, so the correct diagnosis may be difficult, especially if the doctor is not informed about the patient having been abroad.	5.547772154053319
The cases presented also point out possible legal consequences of a missed diagnosis.	6.468820327667926
Prognostically relevant factors based on the histological assessment of the resected pancreas are known.	5.96877467994504
However, additional parameters, such as biological staging of the intrinsic malignant potentiality of the tumor, would be useful.	4.772154854346666
There has been no uniform finding of a relationship between CD44 variant expression and tumor progression.	5.924930416872722
Method: We assessed the expression pattern and prognostic impact of CD44 standard and CD44 isoforms v4, v5, v6, v7 and v10 in 40 ductal pancreatic carcinomas by immunochemistry on paraffin-embedded tumor material in patients after tumor resection.	8.02367419076642
At the time of the investigation neither histomorphological parameters nor the survival time were known.	5.61791562352131
Results: There was no correlation between the histomorphological parameter and the expression of CD44 splice variants.	4.184023763515647
CD44 splice variants v4-v10 were almost only expressed in tumor tissue.	7.795943716235645
In ductal pancreatic carcinoma, patients with an overexpression of CD44 splice variants had a worse prognosis.	5.688171726703511
However, because of the small number of cases this was statistically not significant.	2.896516148976894
Conclusion: CD44 splice variants may have an influence on prognosis in ductal pancreatic carcinoma.	6.043426576630077
However, further investigation on a larger number of patients is necessary to confirm these results.	5.634596551247552
Regarding the etiology of thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), congenital bone and/or fibromuscular anomalies, positional characteristics and trauma play a role.	6.384664168974601
Signs and symptoms are extremely variable, depending on whether the compression of the plexus, of the artery or of the vein is predominant.	4.553923174398707
In the clinical examination the AEST test is of utmost importance.	4.190526931696994
The visualization of the subclavian artery and vein by DAS in different positions is mandatory.	5.20078639979464
Less than 5% of the patients show a subclavian artery aneurysm, but 76% have obstructions of digital arteries.	5.495084270269888
Every patient, must undergo a neurological examination including the measuring of the proximal ulnar and median nerve conduction times.	7.565008430531262
Anatomical lesions of the subclavian artery, reduction of the proximal nerve conduction times and high-degree venous compression as well as disabling pain during the night with abuse of analgesics are absolute indications for the decompression of the neurovascular bundle.	6.57820562458373
This is achieved by the transaxillary exarticulation of the first rib together with a cervical rib and fibromuscular bands if present.	6.965460334437313
The results of the primary operation are favourable: completely painfree 85%, markedly improved 12%, unchanged or worse 3%.	5.747215858796562
The results of operations for persisting and recurrent TOS are disappointing: completely painfree 48%, markedly improved 31%, but 21% unchanged or worse.	6.545748591701629
Regional perfusion of the lung is not distributed homogeneously within the organ.	5.772645881855049
This phenomenon has been explained by the classical concept of West et al.	7.3248976724646715
based on the isolated canine lung.	4.807561681807068
The concept stresses the importance of different gravitational forces along the vertical axis of the lung resulting in three zones in which no pulmonary perfusion (zone 1), waterfall-like perfusion (zone 2), and continuous blood flow (zone 3) prevail.	6.793275030055658
In this article, we review recent publications in which observations have been made which cannot be explained by the West model.	5.5883056543944924
A new concept of distribution of regional pulmonary perfusion is presented which centers on vascular factors which are better suited to account for observed blood flow heterogeneities.	7.481812808410871
The pulmonary vasculature is composed of repetitions of one structural unit: the vessel bifurcation.	7.609644379752219
Apart from its size, each single bifurcation is similar to all others.	5.775504043442788
The pulmonary vessel tree can, therefore, be considered to be self-similar.	4.82979505752165
Self-similarity has been identified as a design principle of living nature.	6.2497799416951825
Self-similar objects can produce heterogeneity which is also self-similar when viewed at different scales of magnification.	8.165652873254455
For measurement of the structure of such objects and their function, i.e., in this case the heterogeneity of pulmonary perfusion, fractal geometry is best suited.	4.761102727318216
Distribution of blood flow within the lung can be described by means of fractal analysis, and all phenomena of perfusion distribution can easily be explained when applying this concept.	5.952207801884682
Furthermore, since the basis of fractal analysis is pulmonary vascular anatomy, it lends itself for the study of blood flow distribution.	6.1567348808695535
A major advantage is the independence of fractal parameters from resolution of perfusion measurements.	7.683717487589774
Thus, fractal analysis can be used to compare results that have been obtained using different resolutions and different species.	6.03887442473154
Fractal methods have previously been used in medicine for other purposes.	6.967512220089779
Nonlinear analyses of heart beat variability can predict the onset of malign cardiac dysrhythmias hours before actual appearance in the ECG.	7.457840754606002
Very similar methods applied to electrical brain activity have been shown to allow prediction of epileptical seizures approximately 15 min prior to appearance of clinical symptoms.	7.634693479354319
In part I of the paper the biomechanical and technical background of the EPTT using the MPT fixator and the indications for this procedure have been described.	6.888244206573034
In part II we report about the clinical application of the EPTT in 67 patients with a wide spectrum of repairs and reconstructions of the extensor mechanism.	5.732843406499181
48 patients had fresh injuries, 18 of them with severe concomitant knee lesions and 19 patients had neglected rsp.	6.872700987987828
There were 4 deep infections, two of them related to the MPT fixator.	5.6632892335801435
In the patients with uneventful healing the fixator remained in place for 7.3 weeks in average.	7.274987685219313
The clinical, isokinetic and radiological results were reviewed in 17 patients with an average follow-up time of 37.3 months.	3.6805435071549364
There were 5 patients with partial patellectomy and tendon reattachment because of lower patella pole comminution and 12 patients with tendon reattachment ruptured at the inferior patella pole or suture repair in midsubstance rupture.	7.777183977617848
The clinical results according to the IKDC score were rated in 3 patients as normal, in 10 patients as nearly normal and in 4 patients as abnormal.	5.5178310855216175
This rating was highly dependend on the subjective judgement by the patients who considered their operated knees not as normal as the contralateral knees.	7.673454141918396
From our clinical experiences and results we can derive that the EPTT enables the surgical management of extensor mechanism disruptions with a minimum of internal fixation material and provides a safe protection of the repairs and reconstructions during the healing period.	7.525247358614441
The EPTT allows immediate unrestricted functional rehabilitation and early walking without crutches.	7.501611347939643
Thus the EPTT represents an effective alternative to the patello-tibial cerclage with a wire or synthetic ligaments.	7.592703146376357
Ondansetron is more effective than a placebo in treating postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), but it has not been proved to be superior to established antiemetics for prophylaxis or therapy.	4.89119908159017
We compared ondansetron vs droperidol for the treatment of PONV.	5.596685985683319
Our prospective, randomized double-blind study was performed between 15 October 1992 and July 1993; it included 271 gynaecological ASA I - III inpatients who had been operated on under general anaesthesia with intubation.	6.948671841937304
Patients were excluded if: there was no informed consent; it was an ambulatory or emergency operation; the patient was pregnant or breast feeding; allergies were being treated with antihistamines; drug addiction was present or convulsions or Parkinson's disease; any pre- or intraoperative antiemetic medication had been administered.	7.212341624755809
All patients wishing an antiemetic and/or suffering from at least one emetic episode during the first 24 h postoperatively received either 8 mg ondansetron or 1.25 mg droperidol from identical 4 ml ampoules intravenously.	7.089804600361661
The verbal nausea score (1=none, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe) was recorded every 30 min for 4 h, then before and 2 h after each antiemetic dose.	7.853915841209584
All emetic episodes and the interval between administration and effect were also noted.	6.683577056110034
Patients were interviewed 36 - 48 h postoperatively on subjective effects, side-effects and individual acceptance.	5.576498317877273
After oral premedication with diazepam, anaesthesia was induced with thiopental, in a few cases with etomidate or propofol.	4.2802226339010545
Relaxation was achieved with pancuronium or atracurium and, when indicated, with succinylcholine.	5.868103485591835
Muscular relaxation was antagonized with neostigmin and glycopyrrolate.	6.791541314012949
Gastric content was aspirated once after intubation.	6.301634022942657
Anaesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide/oxygen, enflurane, halothane or isoflurane and fentanyl up to 0.3 mg. Statistical evaluation was performed by the unpaired Student's t-test and the Mann-Whitney U test.	5.116321449118073
Categoric variables were examined by the 2 test.	4.550232484493996
Significance was defined as P<0.05.	3.527924581875572
Of 271 patients, 100 (37%) experienced PONV.	2.934716260765301
The groups were statistically comparable with respect to demographic data, type and duration of operation, emesis record, perioperative uterotonic medication.	5.736346976621933
Twenty patients in the ondansetron group and 27 in the droperidol group received the first antiemetic within 2 h, the other patients up to 17 h after extubation.	6.311426192913555
Nausea scores and emetic episodes were identical before antiemetic medication.	7.447542494420668
The reduction of these parameters after medication was similar.	5.973064483480892
Complete response over 6 h was 60% in the ondansetron and 68% in the droperidol group.	4.167528717279416
In both groups the first medication failed in 4 cases during the initial 2 h. Twenty of the ondansetron and 16 of the droperidol patients needed a second dose; among these 2 and 4, respectively, a third ampoule.	6.71033008867255
No rescue medication was necessary over 24 h and a mean of 1.4 ampoules was administered in both groups.	6.20101283943828
Onset and quality of emetic action were identical in both groups.	3.726398181638279
It was not possible to evaluate 25 interviews due to linguistic or amnestic problems.	5.841608283460023
Multiple side-effects were noted frequently.	4.584969613961323
Injection pain was reported significantly more often in the droperidol, pruritus in the ondansetron group.	5.214610166684602
Ninety-three percent of the ondansetron and 85% of the droperidol patients opted for the same drug for future PONV treatment.	6.916921072113581
Ondansetron (8 mg) and droperidol (1.25 mg) proved to be equally effective when used as a postoperative antiemetic.	4.9952284422625075
Both drugs showed similar side-effects.	5.009503451046963
Due to differences in methods it was difficult to compare our results to those obtained in other studies.	6.1895641394080165
Paradoxical embolism is well-known in theory but rarely encountered in clinical practice.	5.557103140413233
The typical pathophysiological background is the coincidence of venous thrombosis, elevated right atrial pressure, and a consecutive right-to-left shunting via a patent foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect.	5.2723156724471405
This review summarizes the results of internal cardioversion of atrial fibrillation in comparison to external cardioversion.	5.242762301183295
Internal cardioversion was achieved by positioning defibrillation electrodes in the right atrium and coronary sinus (alternatively in the left pulmonary artery).	5.409273413739705
In previous studies also a combined internal/external cardioversion was used by locating a defibrillation electrode in the right atrium together with a cutaneous patch electrode.	7.739804090618946
Although in comparative studies the success rate of 91-93% with internal cardioversion is higher compared to success rates of 67-79% with external cardioversion, the conventional method of external cardioversion remains the method of first choice.	7.367220006962873
The success rate of internal cardioversion after failed external cardioversion ranges from 73 to over 90%.	5.490607821573988
Possible indications for primary internal cardioversion are: induced atrial fibrillation during electrophysiological studies, atrial fibrillation after cardiothoracic surgery and cardioversion of atrial fibrillation in patients with permanent pacemaker implants.	6.189939255784232
Objective: The objective of the study is to evaluate the importance of home care for patients with advanced tumor diseases and for their families.	4.495345627735231
VDD single-lead systems use floating ring electrodes for atrial sensing.	7.50295788487029
To ensure an optimal atrial sensing function, knowledge of the interactions between electrode design, pacemaker, amplifier and implantation technique is required.	6.974389356136272
In this overview, technical determinants of atrial sensing concerning atrial ring configuration (surface area, ring spacing, full/half ring), design of the lead (insulation material, conductor coil configuration), and amplifier design (differential amplifier, sensing impedance, bandpass filter) shall be explained and related to determinants at implant (AV distance, site of implantation, atrial position, intraoperative measurement technique).	7.6623345703972205
(1) Ring configuration: Bipolar atrial full ring systems have proved to be efficient with narrow (5-10mm) or wide (15-30mm) ring spacing, as well as bipolar half ring systems with DAB configuration and narrow ring spacing.	7.502232884971958
Especially in a position close to the atrial wall, a wide ring spacing detects a less clear-cut signal than a short ring spacing; on the other hand, with a wide ring spacing, sensing is less compromised if the rings move to a worse position further away from the wall.	7.252806327612762
A narrow ring spacing detects a sharper signal if positioned close to the atrial wall, but a considerable reduction of sensed P wave amplitude may result if it moves away from the wall or to an oblique angle relative to the atrial depolarization front.	7.994970217768881
(2) Design of the lead: Polyurethane as insulation material provides a higher stiffness than silicone insulation.	6.926110098667762
A coaxial conductor configuration increases stiffness and consequently the possibility to manipulate the atrial part of the lead.	7.614076128584055
Thus, if a position close to the atrial wall is desired, the combination of a coaxial conductor coil, polyurethane insulation, and a narrow ring spacing seems most promising.	6.1293759551768145
(3) Amplifier design: For atrial sensing in VDD systems, bipolar sensing, differential amplifier, high sensing impedance (>=2k), and a wide bandpass filter (e.g., 10-100Hz) should be realized.	5.539977619661149
Especially the inclusion of a relatively low frequency range (10-40Hz) is important, because compared to a fixed atrial electrode, a higher quantity of the atrial signal sensed by a floating electrode is in the low-frequency range.	6.00804057176496
(4) Implantation: To choose the best fitting electrode, a preoperative assessment of the size of the right cardiac cavities should be performed.	5.2949283083854
A position of the ring electrodes in the mid-to-high right atrium parallel to the lateral wall should be the goal.	5.441186861804944
Correct interpretation of the sensed P wave amplitude and prediction of sufficient sensing after connection with the pacemaker is only possible with exact knowledge of the measurement technique of the intraoperative pacing system analyzer and the connected permanent pacemaker device (bandpass filter, signal peak-to baseline or peak-to-peak).	8.400589315354905
Attention should be paid to the fixation of the electrode at the site of insertion to avoid postoperative dislocation of the ring electrodes.	6.1837782071388885
Knowledge of different electrode/pacemaker specific parameters and special aspects at implantation is a prerequisite for optimal function of VDD single-lead systems.	8.065174027951466
Preoperatively, considerations should concern the choice of the electrode (AV distance, ring spacing) and implantation strategy (position close to or rather apart from the atrial wall).	6.98038387871856
An atrial position may only be accepted if sufficient sensing can be documented with a measuring method similar to that of the implanted pacemaker.	6.829074162594512
Objectives: To investigate the agreement (and its potential dependency on extravascular lung water) between transpulmonary (TPID) and standard pulmonary artery (PAID) thermodilution cardiac output  measurements.	6.9770258531192635
In the industrial Western world, 8 % of the population suffer from urogenital discomfort.	4.827291645540272
Epidemiologic studies show that the incidence rises with age.	4.63955348351576
In light of the steadily increasing longevity in the female population, clinically manifested irregularities such as urogenital atrophy, recurrent urinary tract infections, irritable bladder, and incontinence pose a challenge to the attending physician.	6.403459570505873
To this day, urinary incontinence in later life is considered "normal" and "caused by old age."	4.98274315835938
However, among other age-related reasons, the main cause of this disorder is postmenopausal hormone deficiency.	4.927507506670358
Thus, following thorough diagnostics, pathological changes in the urogenital tract can often be reduced or altogether eliminated by simple conservative measures such as topical hormone administration, which rapidly enhance patients' quality of life.	6.323838271952651
The present study gives an overview of the physiology of urogenital aging and the diagnostic and therapeutic means available to physicians to alleviate patients' discomfort.	6.009669584446363
Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) is one of the most common pain syndromes in childhood, with prevalence rates ranging from 10 to 20% in all school-age children.	3.241529598640822
In nearly 50% the complaints persist over many years of their life-span to adolescence or adulthood.	3.4493138240300216
Although the empirical findings have increased in the last decade, our knowledge about the etiology, pathogenesis, and pathophysiology is still very limited.	2.9411612313160593
Current approaches suggest that we understand recurrent pain syndromes as a complex and multidimensional disturbance (biopsychosocial paradigm).	4.890811972681465
In this respect there is strong evidence for the major importance of psychosocial causes (daily hassles, specific life events), psychopathological factors (anxiety, depression, somatization disorder), and social environmental influences (mother's psychopathology, social modelling, reinforcement) in the pathogenesis of functional abdominal pain.	5.508098905381341
The noticeable correlation with other pain syndromes and functional disturbances indicates that recurrent pain may possibly be a manifestation of a basic somatization disorder.	7.532070512939399
The unfavourable long-term prognosis supports the need for early and specific interventions.	3.9875796039457096
Psychological treatment requires a medical examination to exclude organic origins.	6.5888414320049264
Some of these invasive diagnostic procedures can be very difficult, expensive and distressing for the child.	6.317305969276813
Behavioural medicine is based upon having an extensive family history and symptom analysis.	6.121630590313063
The psychological interventions applied in clinical practice include prophylaxis, reduction of pain symptoms and environmental modification.	2.447226629352593
In recent years there has been an increasing trend to create more complex and multidimensional behavioural treatment programs for children.	2.4012405981914227
Although preliminary data on the use of these behavioural medicine programs have shown some promise, further investigations are needed to examine the applicability and effectiveness of specific interventions in the treatment of abdominal pain symptoms.	5.6465452538107925
Dermatologic disorders of the stump in patients with a leg amputation may have characteristic pathophysiologic and clinical features.	6.433720963950575
A knowledge of these factors may lead to earlier diagnosis and avoid immobilization.	3.217008477155299
There ist no German language review of this aspect of dermatology.	7.304929172316118
After providing an overview of the problem, including a discussion of prostheses, we review the following problems: mechanically induced blisters, follicular keratoses, epidermoid cysts, stump edema syndrome, acroangiodermatitis (pseudo-kaposi sarcoma) and verrucous hyperplasia.	5.888467316078749
Secondary aortoenteric fistulas are a well-known complication after open repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.	5.401362933528922
This is the first case description of an aortoenteric fistula after endoluminal treatment of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.	5.881942193174263
Preoperative diagnosis by antigranulocyte immunscintigraphy established infection of the protheses.	6.7118842061924795
The problem was solved by closing the defect of duodenum, removing the endoprotheses and in situ reconstruction with omentumplasty.	8.717629199871316
The reasons and consequences are discussed.	5.488817524482108
Concepts in the treatment of craniomaxillofacial fractures have changed over the last 15 years.	5.107193401600469
Modern imaging techniques have become a central part in establishing a proper diagnosis.	5.5735325100706365
Advanced life support and intensive care medicine allow for early primary fracture treatment.	5.293686386358671
The former principles of minimal exposure of bone fragments using small incisions have been replaced by principles from reconstructive craniofacial surgery comprising extensive subperiosteal dissection, exposure of all fracture lines, open reduction and rigid internal fixation.	7.844336704808988
Missing bony structures are replaced primarily by autogenous bone grafts.	6.531489102292935
Using these concepts, most late esthetic and functional sequelae of facial fractures can be diminished remarkably.	6.907149284011859
In a 20-year period (1974-1993), 4230 patients underwent surgery of the gallbladder.	4.3079332736241875
Acute cholecystitis was the indication for emergency laparotomy in 869 patients (20,5 %).	5.310415688463105
Retrospective analysis demonstrated that after adjustment for age, sex, and mode of surgery - elective versus emergency - advanced age is not a risk factor contributing to mortality in uncomplicated cases of emergency surgery.	6.694494863065145
Cases of acute cholecystitis complicated by perforation, peritonitis, and/or the presence of concrements in the biliary duct are associated with an increased mortality, however.	4.650553442440067
We were able to demonstrate that advanced age is a risk factor in complicated cases and contributes to increased post-surgical mortality.	6.162809706642313
The clinical effect of ionidizing radiation on ocular neovascularizations is controversial not only because of the variety of treatment modalities.	5.489680438987169
The aim of our study was to investigate an experimental model which allows to evaluate radiation parameters and to study the mechanism of the inhibitory effect on neoangiogenesis.	5.274667351371015
We report on a 59-year-old woman patient with selective IgA deficiency and familial hypercholesterinaemia.	4.99259582553316
To lower elevated LDL levels in the patient's blood, immunoadsorption therapy with sheep-anti-human polyclonal antibodies coupled to sepharose columns was administered.	7.218973186775274
During the procedure, the patient developed an anaphylactic shock requiring intensive care treatment.	2.350256648602497
The patient's history revealed a fresh cell therapy with fetal sheep cells 10 years previously.	6.945255757512739
Intracutaneous testing confirmed sensitization to sheep immunoglobulin, which was the most likely reason for the anaphylactic shock.	6.1714213183523245
A nationwide survey was performed to evaluate the significance of knee replacement (endoprosthesis) in Germany.	5.300812945971357
All orthopaedic, traumatologic and general surgeons were asked about their preferred surgical techniques, favourite types of prosthesis and related issues.	7.3970994498568965
Sledge prostheses have been increasingly preferred to constrained prostheses in the last few years.	6.10588946131192
Unicompartmental prostheses as well as constrained prostheses and high tibial osteotomies are still chosen for special cases.	7.315100828079101
Revisions were most commonly due to patella problems.	6.392961574336724
Patella replacement is popular to prevent this problem.	6.0916617198827465
Endoprosthetic knee surgery receives as much endorsement among German surgeons as endoprosthetic hip surgery.	7.791285467178684
An important problem is the increasing costs of the method.	5.123978738443841
Chronic pulmonary hypertension and septic lung failure display different clinical features resulting in severe disturbances in the pulmonary circulation.	7.360930112960854
In these diseases, the pulmonary bloodflow is impaired by a pathologic constriction of blood vessels that may lead to right ventricular overloading as well as serious worsening of gas exchange mainly caused by ventilation/perfusion mismatch.	6.589029084848112
Various mechanisms deteriorating the vascular function may induce both an irreversible and a reversible contraction of pulmonary vessels, respectively.	7.712080056484623
Two pharmacological approaches exist to reduce the vascular resistance:...	6.093139255242246
Objective: to examine mortality, mobility, pain, institutionalization rates six month after hip fractures.	4.783730672146857
Lateral acetabular osteotomy in comparison to three-dimensional osteotomies of the pelvis in hip dysplasia is a simple technical procedure.	6.368421324642699
Contraindications are an age over 8 years and an irreducible femoral head.	7.635228946235349
For a long time we have used xenogenic deproteinized bone wedges from animals.	5.626577165550442
We now use autoclaved and deep-frozen wedges from allogenic femoral heads.	7.351295554309857
The wedges are sterilized at 121  °C for 20 min and then kept deep-frozen in the bone bank.	7.914598338002675
Our results in 109 patients show that this method is very successful; even extreme angles of acetabular index correction are possible with this technique.	7.283543800941488
It is unfortunate that the lateral acetabuloplasty with autoclaved allogenic bone graft is not used frequently and we recommend that this method be installed at all paediatric orthopaedic hospitals.	8.074048801302755
There are only few publications about the effect of music therapy on pain relief.	6.523515126364865
The intention of this prospective study is to demonstrate the influence of the Nordoff/Robbins method of active music therapy in a group of 12 patients with fibromyalgia, myofascial pain syndromes and polyarthritis on pain reduction, life quality and coping.	5.93692117828141
The clinical parameters of each patient were related to the observations in the audio- and video-documented music therapy settings and to the self-reported changes in pain intensity and pain behaviour.	7.1358341938412115
There was a significant reduction of pain intensity and pain-related disability in the music group compared to a control group, but no change in the depression and anxiety score.	4.782723022977065
The influence of music therapy could be even better demonstrated in the systematic analysis of the single cases by individual profiles.	6.6035838911061155
Active music therapy affects especially the communicative and emotional dimension of chronic pain.	7.136440858650812
Psychophysiological and psychodynamic models are presented to explain the effectiveness of music therapy on pain reduction.	6.365843425989047
Clinical studies on music therapy as well as on other "art therapies" should relate the analysis of clinical parameters to the descriptive-phenomenological documentation of the therapeutic process to demonstrate systematically the influence of music and art in the individual case.	6.979047185601787
Background: Retrospective analysis to  assess the value of the sequential arginine-insulin-test (SAIT) in the diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency (GHD).	6.02351743106529
Case Report: The case of a 57-year-old woman is reported who was admitted for peripheral hypereosinophilia.	3.1426414888645313
Auditory similarities in voices of monozygotic twins have already been described in the literature.	5.055676707277118
However, is there a clinical relevance?	4.947919627292641
Thus, the present study was designed to identify parameters of vocal performance and acoustic features which are significantly more similar in monozygotic twins than in non-related persons.	6.460884948791331
In our hypothesis, comparable prerequisites for an increased vocal load in a profession or in an artistic education of the voice could be due to these similarities.	7.79632136155433
We compared intra-pair differences with data from a control group.	6.133293864658995
Moreover, we examined the correlation of intra-pair differences with the age of the monozygotic twins.	4.793973625895367
A greater difference in older twin pairs than in younger pairs could show the effect of an exogene influence.	7.645802521172165
In addition to the few phoniatric studies in twins in the literature, we used current methods for acoustic analysis.	5.440203221398716
We examined seven parameters of vocal performance and three acoustic features in 31 monozygotic twin pairs (median age 36 years, range 18-75 years) and compared them with 30 control group pairs, which consisted of non-related persons of the same age and sex, newly combined from the group of monozygotic twins ("statistical twins").	6.84476775747943
We found significant differences in seven of ten parameters (vocal range, highest and lowest vocal fundamental frequency, fundamental speaking frequency, maximum voice intensity, number of partials, vibrato of intensity; U-test by Mann-Whitney).	6.929923683467802
No correlation of the differences of the identical twins with age was found in the examined parameters.	5.699437152365293
The voices of identical twins are significantly more similar than those of non-related persons regarding the above mentioned features.	7.537436085556152
Thus, the suitability of the voices of monozygotic twins for professions with a high demand on voice is comparable.	6.343205166310681
Results of the group comparison correlate largely with the literature.	5.412121816059794
The missing correlation with age could be due to the fact that the environmental effects were not measurable, and/or the development of the voice is more influenced by genetic effects.	6.311898875215634
After > 10 000 treatments - our HM3/4 and MPL 9000 have been replaced by the Siemens Lithostar multiline.	6.190992454644067
As a ESWL center with ESWL as the primary treatment indication for all types of stones in kidney and ureter we report our initial experience with this new multifunctional lithotripter.	6.708102343126378
The system consists of an electromagnetic shock-wave emitter (Focus 80 x 5 mm) and a digital fluoroscopy unit.	6.407237529183617
Stone localization is achieved in a - 10 ° and + 30  ° position without movement of the patient.	6.504906746219167
The treatment table itself allows most endourologic and percutaneous auxiliary procedures.	7.1795589048498565
Additionally, an intergrated inline ultrasound is available.	5.419992689357651
From 10/94 to 08/95, 204 male and 96 female patients with a mean age of 50.7 (4-92) years underwent ESWL with the Lithostar multiline.	6.571680906079798
The mean stone diameter was 10.3 (2-20) mm with 53 % ureteral and 47 % renal stones.	6.039875843364984
300 patients underwent 480 treatments (average shocks 3673, range 793-8000; mean energy level 5.5, range 1-9).	6.210866862032138
Stone localization was achieved after 5 (1-39) min (mean fluoroscopy time 3.1 (0.5-16.2) min).	4.526666153382108
In 92.7 % no analgesic premedication was done.	4.339468305908895
56 % of the patients needed no analgesics at all during ESWL.	5.024311907454377
44 % received 8.1 (2-15) mg Piritramid intravenously.	5.129624103212498
Epidural anesthesia was performed in only 2.3 % for a second treatment.	4.166575735025491
95 % of the patients had complete stone disintegration.	3.202144713278976
In 68 % disintegration was achieved in one session.	4.597077032137473
ESWL was repeated for further disintegration in 18.5 %, because of an unsuccessful treatment in 11.5 % and because of technical interruption of the previous session in 2.5 %.	4.784203107374874
We saw subkapsular haematomas in 2 %.	4.866782171648757
Auxiliary procedures following ESWL were necessary in only 9.2 % of the patients.	3.8379716246473357
In situ ESWL with the new Lithostar Multiline seems to be as effective as the Dornier HM3/4.	7.004183332833714
Analgesia-free treatment was performed in more than 50 % of the patients.	3.142609741210532
Auxiliary procedures were less frequently necessary as compared to our previous experience with in situ ESWL.	5.991296819734224
We report on a strikingly frequent referral of former preterm babies with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and subsequent ARDS in our hospital during the winter 1994/95 with regard to the clinical course under application of alternative treatment modalities.	6.268773238829243
Treatment modalities like inhalational ribavirin, use of bronchodilators and instillation of surfactant had been tried without success.	7.745909190122397
All children (age: 1-43 months) were ventilated for 6.6 (1-17) days with FiO2 = 1.0 and a mean airway pressure of 16.4 (10-24) cm H2O.	5.207377433327922
Mean arterial blood gases were 49 (paO2) and 41 (pCO2) mm Hg, the OI was 33.4.	5.466573796885021
By inhalational NO in combination with IPPV or HFOV 4 patients could be stabilized, in the other 6 ECMO became necessary.	6.001727920856822
Two of them died in spite of several weeks on ECMO; 8 children survived and could be discharged home after a mean hospital stay of 3 months.	6.9989715291219134
Even in very severe cases of RSV infection treatment modalities like NO, HFOV and ECMO can be used successfully.	7.282486621338973
The use of these treatment modalities must be considered before the lung damage is irreversible; in those cases a pre-existing BPD is no contraindication even for extracorporeal lung support.	7.208304061095769
The vascular organization of human spermatic cord was analyzed by means of injection and by casting preparation of the testicular artery and veins of the pampiniform plexus after orchiectomy.	7.384935216629756
After leaving the human testis, the testicular veins are organized in two main groups and form two vein plexus.	8.000299542073643
One of these vein groups forms a tight plexus around the testicular artery.	7.435311991358466
Computer-aided 3-D reconstructions based on the paraffin serial sections of the human spermatic cord allowed us to demonstrate the relation between the blood vessels and the other tissue structures of the spermatic cord.	6.629610574540316
The results obtained allowed us to subdivide the human spermatic cord into three compartments.	6.944319410404641
The dorsomedial compartment contains the vas deferens and its blood vessels.	7.559301279669718
The middle compartment contains the testicular artery and the vein group which forms a tight plexus around this artery.	8.035279183436828
The ventrolateral compartment contains a vein group which shows no topographic relation to the testicular artery.	7.569048677573124
This vein group is embedded in a large, macroscopically visible volume of fatty tissue.	6.187106569637017
To be sure of sparing the testicular artery during antegrade sclerotherapy this vein group should be prepared.	8.20562564122615
It has known for a long time that Sydenham's chorea and tics, as seen in Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome (GTS), are phenomenologically very similar.	7.381630537980627
Tics may occur as symptoms of acute Sydenham's chorea or persist over years as residual symptoms.	7.8755727887146145
Investigations of children suffering from GTS, including obsessive-compusilve symptoms, have provided signs of a poststreptococcal autoimmune process but also shown that treatment based on immunological interventions has been effective.	7.74255800772695
We treated a 14-year-old boy showing all diagnostic criteria of GTS, familial susceptibility, and an increase in the antibody titer of streptococcal antigens with 7S immunoglobulins i.v.	6.355466446883143
Response to this therapy was good regarding motor tics, vocal tics, and behavioral symptoms such as disturbed impulse control which still persisted after 9 months.	8.069103353687236
These findings and the successful therapy underline reports of the literature and point to a pathogenetic mechanism of an immunologically triggered disturbance of the striatal dopaminergic system, at least in a subgroup of GTS.	6.981801659011067
We report on three cases with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or prediabetes.	4.255313087320027
All three patients suffered from autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type II.	5.097576059063109
Among our patients with isolated IDDM (about 250 patients) no case of ITP was seen.	6.250592560086569
Therefore we recommend that all patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus should be carefully monitored for other diseases associated with autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type II.	6.774521091311217
The high rate of coronary artery disease (CAD) mortality needs preventive intervention.	2.919845553384089
Several studies have documented the effectiveness of LDL-cholesterol lowering in CAD primary prevention.	6.402818850848831
The West of Scotland Prevention Study resulted in risk reduction by about one third through LDL-cholesterol lowering.	7.5275036298171205
The data indicate that specifically patients at high risk benefit from lipid reduction.	5.60861349063613
High risk patients have besides high LDL-cholesterol one or more additional risk factors such as family history of premature coronary artery disease, hypertension, smoking, low HDL-cholesterol or diabetes.	5.616364625953433
Therapy primarily aims at life style changes, secession of smoking and weight reduction as well as dietary changes to achieve LDL-cholesterol levels of 115-175 mg/dl (3-4.5 mmol/L), depending on the individual risk constellation.	5.576150542815816
This strategy allows to reduce the number of patients needed to treat in order to prevent one CAD event (56 in isolated hypercholesterolemia) to 14-24 in high risk persons, approaching the number (n=13) known for effective lipid lowering in secondary prevention of coronary heart disease.	6.689954721889622
One hundred and three cases of Spitz nevi were reviewed.	6.531590529646382
36% of these patients were adults.	2.356332512758355
The lesions in children occurred primarily on the face and secondarily on the trunk followed by the extremities.	6.037941302543236
In adults, they affect the legs in women, and the trunk in men as does malignant melanoma.	5.703513852516182
Clinically they were diagnosed more frequently as Spitz nevi in children and adolescents than in adults.	6.967797487313549
Spitz nevi were most commonly mistaken clinically for "common" melanocytic nevus, hemangioma, verruca, fibrous histiocytoma, molluscum contagiosum, granuloma pyogenicum, keloid, and melanoma.	8.561666680957009
Histologically, there are various expressions of Spitz nevi, but they are usually compound melanocytic nevi with little pigmentation and typically large spindle- and/or epithelioid melanocytes.	6.68049623575251
There are only small histopathological differences between Spitz nevi in childhood and adulthood: one important feature rarely seen in Spitz nevi of adults is multiple mitotic figures at the dermo-epidermal junction but rarely at the base of the melanocytic nevus.	7.75146107932363
Nevus Reed is considered to possibly be a distinctly pigmented variant of Spitz nevus.	7.250231740072509
A few months ago an endovascular implantable PTFE stent graft became commercially available.	7.35014088492616
Since May 1998 we have treated 15 patients with extensive vascular occlusion at the femoropopliteal level.	6.974756703766232
The implantation is carried out via a single inguinal approach in combination with conventional vascular surgical techniques like orthograde ringstripping of the superficial femoral artery, local TEA and patch-grafting of the femoral bifurcation, angioplasty, local lysis, etc.	6.518627869498425
The self-expanding thin-walled PTFE stent prothesis appears to be a viable alternative to the femoropopliteal P1 bypass and can be performed under local anesthesia, percutaneously or through a small inguinal incision.	6.137754974725025
The implantation can be carried out with minimal tissue trauma.	4.678230393442901
Radiological and orthopaedic outcome in severe and moderate haemophilia A and B patients undergoing long-term prophylactic treatment were prospectively investigated focusing on the age of onset of prophylaxis and the number of joint bleedings prior to treatment.	7.272154165476506
We report on 21 patients with severe and moderate haemophilia A and B receiving prophylactic treatment of between 3.1 and 16.1 years duration.	7.034781565287654
Three patient groups were evaluated according to the age at onset of prophylaxis.	4.949368723425716
In group I (n = 8) prophylactic treatment was initiated in the first 2 years of life.	2.679929239707441
Patients of group II (n = 6) received prophylaxis at the age of 3-6 years.	3.0968423865168457
Late-onset or secondary prophylactic treatment was started at the age of 6 years and above in 7 patients (group III).	5.159815229252013
All patients received virus-inactivated F VIII or F IX concentrates at dosages of 30-40 IU, in some cases up to 50 IU/kg body weight i. v. three times per week for those with haemophilia A and twice per week for those with haemophilia B. Elbow, knee and ankle joints were investigated at 3-4 yearly intervals according to the radiological and orthopaedic scores recommended by the World Federation of Haemophilia (WFH).	7.121240425434093
The total number of joint bleedings before and after start of prophylaxis were recorded in all patients.	5.82603711619702
In group I 7 out of 8 patients had unaffected joints with constant radiological and orthopaedic scores of zero or 1, after a median of 11.25 years of prophylactic treatment.	6.796011050624721
One patient in this group demonstrated mild radiological alterations (score 4).	5.3151784041431105
Patients of group II showed neither radiological nor orthopaedic alterations at study entry.	6.158295523999223
Worsening joint scores could be detected despite ongoing prophylaxis after the 3-year interval (median orthopaedic score 4, median radiological score 8).	7.038607156071814
Treatment group III already showed considerable joint damage at study entry with a median radiological score of 11 (0-33) and a median orthopaedic score of 4 (0-11).	6.921420919368144
Despite prophylactic treatment both, orthopaedic (median 8, range 2-12) and radiological scores (median 19.5, range 2-47) deteriorated after 3 years.	5.473734385892529
Prior to onset of prophylaxis no or only one joint bleeding occurred in treatment group I.	7.16465125368665
In group II, a median of 6 joint bleeds (range 1-8) were reported before prophylaxis was started.	5.114528750871993
Patients of group III usually experienced a median of more than 10 joint haemorrhages (range 6-10 or more).	5.937559313095602
Under prophylactic treatment the number of joint bleedings decreased significantly in groups II and III.	6.928527349155338
However, radiological and orthopaedic scores increased as a sign of progressing osteoarthropathic alterations in patients reporting more than 6 joint haemorrhages before onset of prophylaxis whereas no joint alterations could be assessed in patients with no or only one joint bleeding episode prior to prophylaxis.	7.198407679427059
Even a small number of joint bleedings seems to cause irreversible osteoarthropathic alterations leading to haemophilic arthropathy.	6.995162441651621
Once apparent, further progression of joint damage could not be arrested despite of prophylactic treatment (group II and III).	5.578473177287776
In order to prevent haemophilic arthropathy, effective prophylaxis should be started before or at least after the first joint bleeding in severe haemophilia A and B.	6.656228880774408
The hemodynamic treatment of septic shock consists of fluid repletion, maintenance of an adequate cardiac output, and restoration of mean arterial pressure.	6.374002137501838
Norepinephrine is a potent vasopressor that can be considered when the patient is adequately fluid resuscitated, when cardiac output is greater than 3.5 l/min/m2 (or Sv O2>=65%) and when blood pressure remains low.	6.646403983394943
The objective is to achieve and maintain a mean arterial pressure of 60-70 mmHg, or more in some patients (older or hypertensive patients).	6.685754573538427
Renal effects of norepinephrine were evaluated in several studies; urine output, creatinine clearance, and osmolar clearance are significantly increased.	5.859268658017817
Norepinephrine is perfectly suited in situations of high renal output and low renal resistance, as is the case in septic shock patients.	7.049488454033133
The effect on oxygen transport is unpredictable.	5.967006417355647
The effects on lactate concentrations were poorly evaluated, but several studies suggest that the drug does not worsen and can even improve tissue oxygenation of septic shock patients.	7.109965624130563
Provided that cardiac output is maintained, treatment with norepinephrine is without negative effects on splanchnic tissue oxygenation.	7.338984649312536
In conclusion, the clinical experience with norepinephrine strongly suggests that this drug can successfully increase blood pressure without deteriorating cardiac output and organ function.	7.186423981375594
Whether using norepinephrine in septic shock patients effects mortality as compared to dopamine or epinephrine still requires a prospective study.	7.870897576832813
Is it possible to find a correlation between the localisation of neovascularisations and the localisation and extension of the retinal ischemia?	5.357491823634614
Ischemia was recognized not as capillary non-perfusion but as impaired retinal perfusion.	8.10723828334179
Elderly patients with known episodes of atrial arrhythmia and indication to pacemaker therapy are borderline cases relative to selection of ventricular single-chamber or dual-chamber pacemaker.	7.004234658729471
The frequency of recurrence of arrhythmic episodes under dual-chamber pacemaker therapy is there the most important criterion.	6.444659030669615
The differences between patients prone to paroxysmal atrial tachyarrhythmia (atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter) and patients without atrial tachyarrhythmia in their medical history were investigated.	7.328471525245644
Frequency of recurrence of atrial fibrillation/flutter and the rate of successful therapy after implantation of a dual chamber pacemaker were studied.	5.5620722791317965
The long-term history of 39 patients with known intermittent or durably successfully treated episodes of atrial fibrillation/flutter was compared with 24 patients with new atrial tachyarrhythmia after pacemaker implantation.	7.189091735914715
There was no significant difference in the frequency of recurrence and in therapy efficiency of atrial tachyarrhythmia between both groups.	4.933913522731864
The results show the benefit of implanting a dual chamber pacemaker also for patients with a known history of atrial tachyarrhythmia.	5.251191449923726
It therefore, should be postulated for therapy of those patients.	4.396904188537433
Although the risks and side effects of blood transfusions have been significantly reduced during the past years, the potential infectious and immunologic side effects still require a clear and restricted indication before each transfusion is performed.	6.864659627775606
However, the transfusion errors before and during administration of blood components nowadays represent the highest risk in particular for critical care and high risk patients.	6.478811644209358
This article focuses on the specific problems of handling, preparation, and practical performance of transfusions.	4.626012608427927
Some practical aspects and problems of transfusions are examplary shown for intensive care and high risk patients, such as immunosuppressed, transplanted or polytraumatic patients and critical care premature neonates.	7.152673825305675
Vincent's angina (Plaut-Vincent) is the most prominent disease caused by coinciding infections from fusibacteria and spirochaeta both belonging to obligate anaerobic bacterias.	7.618714020560693
A possible symbiotic infection of both anaerobics may become manifest on the mucous membranes of the oral cavity and the oropharynx beside the tonsillas.	6.743794357903102
The clinical outcome may be different and pose difficulties in the differential diagnosis.	4.858231073704218
We report the case of a 29 year old female patient with necrotizing ulcera of the soft palate suspicious for stomatitis ulceromembranacea.	5.092292212307654
In case necrotizing inflammations of the oral cavity area were to be found infections due to anaerobic bacterias should be considered mostly occuring as mixed infections.	7.1482531134602745
The correct identification by cultivation turnes out to be difficult in that it requires special conditions.	7.331188990730114
Furthermore, reliable detection of these bacterias necessitates careful collection and transport of patients specimens.	5.581836099801973
In case of Fusospirochaetosis (Fusotreponematose) a specimen should be prepared for microscopic examination beside setting up a special culture.	7.621939061840023
This is because the staining is the most suitable procedure for bacteril identification to support the clinical diagnosis of stomatitis ulceromembranacea.	5.696665747146175
Quantitative tissue Doppler echocardiography is a new diagnostic approach to left ventricular systolic performance.	5.770245499322294
The aim of the present study was to validate a recently developed method based on the computer software TDI-Labor enabling a variable time and space related measurement of regional wall velocity from tissue Doppler images.	6.909563107035129
Therefore, in 63 volunteers the mean velocity of a 2 mm thick subendocardial slice during the systolic ejection period was determined from frozen Doppler M-mode images of the left ventricular posterior wall obtained using the left parasternal window.	8.214716208376313
The same images were employed for comparative measurement of the mean endocardial velocity using the conventional M-mode slope approach.	7.580858943537248
Tissue Doppler data of the subendocardial wall velocity were found to correspond closely to the mean endocardial wall velocity (y = 0.97x + 0.17; r = 0.77; p < 0.0001).	5.6853191000897585
The average wall motion gradient of the population was 1.33  +/-  0.35.	4.12642436800735
Wall motion velocity and wall motion gradient were shown to be not age dependent.	6.80405438198512
Historically, the profession of geriatric nurse has arisen from the care of the sick and has developed very differently from region to region.	7.866230467551664
A question as to the status of development of the profession of geriatric nurse cannot be answered by reference to the current status of legislation on professional law matters.	6.030516988163637
If experts in that field focus too long on such matters, there is a danger that decisive developments in the profession of geriatric nurse take place outside their field of vision.	8.131052044899688
It is reported about the recent detection of not yet compensated victims of forced sterilisation during the Third Reich.	7.518646688464573
The author describes the current state of compensation practice.	3.803322847373214
From a global viewpoint, tuberculosis is one of the most important infectious diseases of our time.	5.430881048708797
The situation in Germany, as in most comparable industrialized nations, is stable.	5.480162664114646
The declining trend of previous years continued in 1997, when 11,163 people developed active tuberculosis - an incidence of 13.6/100,000.	6.287908237992631
However, the tuberculosis  problem cannot be restricted to one country, and Germany is particularly affected by trends in Eastern Europe and in the former Soviet countries.	7.230493077946322
These countries experienced a marked increase of tuberculosis  cases and resistant strains during recent  years, a tendency which can only be countered by fast, well-aimed and efficient action in the affected areas.	7.228488588953677
The industrialized nations in particular should consider financial and logistic contributions as their duty.	7.70935798133053
Crucial for control of the tuberculosis situation  within each country are registration and  close observation of epidemiological trends, identification of high-risk groups, and continuation of established tuberculosis control measures.	7.088924685373516
We report about a 61 years old patient, who suffered a rare ulnar dislocation of the ellbow after being arrested by the police.	6.025112121486139
We report on the eighth known case of a mature metastasis of a mature teratoma of the testis.	6.111259766304748
In a 19-year-old patient who had undergone a pyeloplasty of the left renal pelvis 6 years before, a mature metastasis of an occult mature teratoma of the testis was found at the former operation site.	6.294751145780049
This case - in addition to those published previously - emphasizes the fact that a mature teratoma of the testis has to be regarded as a malignant tumor in adults.	5.538029515060714
It is supposed that the mature teratoma originates, as other testicular tumors, from carcinoma-in-situ-cells, which are responsible for metastasize and are not detected after lysis.	6.942914191903159
Angiofibromas are usually characterized by their occurences in adolescent males with a typical localization and involvement of the posterior nasal cavity and nasopharynx.	7.499946020646633
Even the suspicion of an extranasopharyngeal angiofibroma or an angiofibroma in young children must be viewed in general with skepticism, although reports of angiofibromas with atypical localizations and manifestations in young children have appeared in the literature.	7.763371578050929
Three cases of this fibro-vascular neoplasm with manifestations in the first decade of life and atypical localizations are presented: (1) an angiofibroma medial to the left lacrimal sac in a 15-month old boy, (2) a right paranasal localization in a 9-year-old boy and (3) an angiofibroma limited to the right sphenoid sinus in a 6-year old boy.	5.28977689673634
In all three cases the neoplasm was resected via an endonasal, micro-endoscopic approach that avoided an external incision.	7.000537631795522
According to the literature and based on our own experiences with typical histological findings in all three cases, the clinician has to be aware that the rare angiofibroma can occur in pre-adolescent children with atypical localizations.	5.9665238954424815
The endonasal surgical approach is without any doubt the least traumatic one and in selected cases allows resection of a circumscribed tumor considering functional and aesthetic aspects.	7.680543956026402
Objective: Chronic recurrent abdominal pain in childhood is frequently due to a Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis.	5.493138771540124
The diagnosis should be verified either by gastric biopsy culture or by histological investigations of the gastric mucosa in children.	6.8707093787626645
The gastroscopy necessary for this often requires general anesthesia.	6.83745246875461
The purpose of the present study was to etablish whether an ELISA for Helicobacter pylori has an adequate predictive reliability with regard to the putative gastric histology in order to possibly prevent unnecessary biopsies and associated anesthesias.	6.891001404722868
Complete dislocated fractures of the thoracic spine may have no neurological deficits if separation is present in the middle of the dorsal column.	5.583633908717457
In this case there is no injury to the spinal cord, because the "saving fracture" of the vertebral arc prevents it.	5.929587939640876
One case of a severe dislocated fracture at T11-12 is reported.	6.288092626937861
In practice, a complete set of X-rays should be done after high-speed trauma, even if no neurological deficit is present.	6.012297096130254
The treatment is operative by open reduction and fusion from the ventral or dorsal column.	6.695857855133463
Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) is a naturally occurring transmitter in the mammalian brain, related to sleep regulation and possibly to energy balance in diving or hibernating animals.	7.409741201532683
It has been used for almost 35 years as an intravenous agent for induction of anaesthesia and for long-term sedation.	5.804841085474338
Its convincing pharmacological properties, without serious adresse effects on circulation or respiration, are compromised by its unpredictable duration of action.	6.76266235380355
This is not a major problem with long-term sedation during ICU treatment.	5.182458808355405
GHB has been used with good results for sedation of patients with severe brain injury, where it compares favourably with barbiturates.	6.140355952328869
In animal studies, it seems to possess a protective action against hypoxia on a cellular and whole organ level.	6.281276934442016
However, in some experimental animals GHB has been shown to produce seizure-like activities, and the compound is being used to produce absence-like seizures.	6.685560088240294
GHB has been used in our ICU for years to provide adequate sedation for patients under controlled ventilation or for patients figthing the respirator during spontaneous respiration.	7.971160113040246
No serious side effects were observed in these patients, while in some patients under haemodialysis hypernatraemia and metabolic alkalosis developed; both were reversible after discontinuation of GHB and restriction of additional sodium input (Somsanit, the commercially available GHB preparation in Germany, contains 9.2 mmol sodium/g; the daily dose averages 20-40 g GHB, i.e.	6.907865395272046
In Europe ultrasonography has displaced diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) in the primary survey of polytraumatized patients with suspected abdominal trauma.	6.724258007225961
Hemodynamically unstable patients who are brought to the emergency room with blunt abdominal trauma will go directly to the operating room after a rapid ultrasonography examination with evidence of hemoperitoneum.	7.342917815369698
In hemodynamically stable patients, in addition to ultrasonography, computed tomography can be done.	3.9453509919286103
This is especially efficient if evaluation with sonography is not completely possible or shows little pathology (e.g.	6.048622830263358
small amounts of hemoperitoneum).	5.711826258461337
We report on a posttraumatic aneurysm of the brachiocephalic trunk, something which is rather rare.	5.850210754856621
The injury was caused by blunt chest trauma following a car accident.	4.139152727348848
Computed tomography could not find the brachiocephalic lesion.	6.554268386375177
In patients with fractures of the upper ribs after blunt chest trauma, angiography should be done to exclude severe injuries of the aorta and brachiocephalic vessels.	5.342209201862753
Even after the strengthening by the law of 1997, the German criminal law regarding corruption is no obstacle for cooperation between medical research and industry.	6.918927600230759
The injustice of corruption is an irregular exchange between performing one's duty and benefits.	7.992446100471801
According to this, an enterprise may give funds to a scientist for research purposes if no counter performance exceeding the research is associated with this.	6.71507776164013
However, it makes a difference if the scientist has to show his appreciation by influencing economic decisions of the clinic in favor of the enterprise.	7.195401622481924
In case of such an injustice, it is, under the new law, no longer important if the benefit is destined for the scientist himself or for another person or organization.	6.576068164966319
Thus, it is in the interest of both research and industry to avoid the suspicion of corruption in the first place.	6.053517399728008
A prerequisite for this is the strict observance of the legal and administrative regulations concerning projects financed by third-party funds.	7.588640963113468
Since the immune system plays an important role in the rejection of tumours, current tumour therapy includes immunostimulation.	5.492536184554352
This can be done by interleukin 2 (Il-2), which activates T and killer cells and induces lysis of the tumour.	4.42197010447786
Because the intravenous application of Il-2 may have serious side effects, we treated two patients with peritumoral injections in a pilot study.	5.198286072989787
Both patients suffered from multiple cutaneous metastases of melanoma.	5.896822663842129
A total of 31 and 39x106 IU recombinant Il-2 (Proleukin) respectively was injected in increasing concentrations in one metastasis of each patient.	7.290377853688812
Histologically, almost complete necrosis of the tumour was induced.	4.798237465322216
In comparison with the control specimen, the T-cell-rich infiltrate increased intra- and, in particular, peritumorally.	4.565403601544974
While the ratio of helper to suppressor T cells remained unchanged, the proportions of NK cells, monocytes/macrophages and IL-2-receptor-bearing cells increased.	6.518609382463715
This reaction was restricted to treated metastases.	6.4671207848686105
No clinical side effects or laboratory changes were registered apart from local erythema and swelling.	7.000916275831949
Wear of the articulating components (especially PE-UHMW) of total hip endoprostheses is the most important technical factor limiting the functional lifetime.	7.070383006818479
To minimize wear debris, ceramic heads, according to ISO 6474 (Al2O3), have been used, from 1969 paired with Al2O3 and since 1975 paired with PE-UHMW.	7.289692323637358
Al2O3 balls articulating with cups made from CFRP have been in clinical use since 1988.	7.261130331829715
Laboratory experiments and in-vivo testing showed minimized wear debris and mild biological response to wear products using CFRP (carbon fiber reinforced plastic) instead of PE-UHMW as the cup material.	8.26493076706292
The articulating surfaces of retrieved ceramic heads (Al2O3 - Biolox) and cementless CFRP cups (carbon fiber reinforced plastic, Caproman) were compared using sphericity measurement techniques, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and roughness measurements (including advanced roughness parameters Rvk or Rpk according to ISO 4287).	7.377858110977337
Altogether, the first results of the clinical study showed that the combination Al2O3-ball/CFRP-cup came up to the expected lower wear rates compared with the conventional combinations.	6.697725069497262
The wear rates are comparable with the combination Al2O3/Al2O3 without the material-related problems of ceramic components in all ceramic combinations.	7.439336110492449
Two cases where DNA typing has been carried out for stain analysis are described.	6.336531762975621
In both cases Y chromosomal STR systems have been used in combination with autosomal STR systems.	5.77942095269406
In the first case the DNA from the fingernails of a female victim with skin particles of the male murderer was typed.	7.590025861287576
The male DNA in this mixture of male and female DNA could be typed.	7.413048828325096
The excess of female DNA in the samples did not distrub the PCR reaction of Y-chromosomal systems.	7.75773314259239
In the second case several body parts could be identified to belong to a single male person.	7.134496180528856
The typing of the suspect's DNA did not give any information because of a family relationship.	6.0801581549168
Different kinds of stains have been analysed with DYS 389 I/II, DYS 390, DYS 391, DYS 392 DYS 393 and DYS19.	7.673406797704938
Two multiplex PCR reactions were carried out to save time and stain material.	6.7028792645554045
Although the Y-chromosomal systems are not as polymorphic as autosomal STR systems the analysis of combined haplotypes can give additional information in forensic casework.	7.993823894643845
In a prospectively designed randomized study, we compared the efficacy of sublingual nitroglycerine and intravenous enalaprilat in the out-of-hospital treatment of 46 hypertensive patients with pulmonary edema (defined as rales over both lungs and systolic blood pressure >200 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure >100 mg).	5.854710263851917
The out-of-hospital treatment consists of oxygen (6 Ll/min) via a face mask, furosemide 80 mg i.v., opioids 10 mg s.c., and either sublingual nitroglycerine (n=23; initial dose: 0.8 mg; repetitive application of 0.8 mg every 10 min until a cumulative dose of 3.2 mg) or intravenous enalaprilat (initial dose: 2.5 mg; repetitive application of 2.5 mg every 30 min until a cumulative dose of 10 mg).	5.915829177764305
The aim of the antihypertensive treatment was a reduction of systolic blood pressure below 160 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg until admission to the emergency department.	6.126000176606651
In the emergency room, an arterial and venous blood sample was taken to determine the respiratory (pO2, pCO2) and metabolic status (pH value; base-excess; serum lactate) of the patient.	6.745848584908647
Successful antihypertensive treatment was observed in 13/23 (57%) patients of the enalaprilat group and 15/23 (65%) patients of the nitroglycerine group (p=0.54).	5.513410449547559
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure on admission were similiar in both treatment groups (systolic RR: enalaprilat: 179 [31] mm Hg; nitroglycerine: 184 [38] mm Hg; p=0.59; diastolic RR: enalaprilat: 96 [14] mm Hg; nitroglycerine: 101 [14] mm Hg; p=0.12).	7.334366087185047
No significant differences were observed between the enalaprilat and the nitroglycerine groups concerning respiratory and metabolic parameters on admission (pO2: 67 [15] vs. 64 [17] mm Hg; p=0.50; pCO2: 46 [9] vs. 47 [13]; p=0.75; pH value: 7.27 [0.12] vs. 7.27 [0.09]; p=0.98; BE: -4.2 [3.7] vs. -5.7 [4.1]; p=0.23; lactate: 4.2 [3.3] vs. 4.2 [2.7]; p=0.98).	5.49741294997025
Intravenous enalaprilat did not exhibit any advantage compared to nitroglycerine in terms of blood pressure reduction or respiratory and metabolic parameters on admission to the emergency room.	7.0287804137484065
We conclude that enalaprilat is no substitute for nitroglycerine in the out-of-hospital treatment of hypertensive patients with pulmonary edema.	6.860041825660111
Paragangliomas of the glomus caroticum are relatively rare, but highly vascularized neoplasmas, which develop from chemoreceptors.	6.022156690879694
They can be develop at anyage, but most often in the third or fourth decade of life.	6.338420050324584
Paragangliomas grow very slowly and are most always of benign origin.	7.432149327239622
There is a familial predisposition, and an autosomal-dominant transmission is presumed.	3.4212049493866927
They are commonly located in the jugular region; in rare cases a polytopic manifestation is found.	5.747751599415028
We describe the case of a 47-year-old male patient who was referred to our department because of a progressive swelling of the neck on both sides.	3.6789248845465043
Contrast-enhanced computed tomography had displayed soft tissue tumors in the jugular regions.	4.680621271081296
We performed an operative exploration, which showed a highly vascularized tumor.	5.5157439154953005
Histopathologic analysis revealed the diagnosis of a paraganglioma.	3.0040882155611683
An angiography of the neck and thoracic region, furthermore, revealed an additional paraganglioma in the anterior mediastinum.	4.5413885206086775
Using a surgical approach via lateral cervicotomies and thoracotomy the paragangliomas were extirpated.	7.8756049993191715
Our case report demonstrates the rare polytopic manifestation of paragangliomas.	4.9396995787582405
This perivascular neoplasms have to be removed before haemodynamic complications develop.	6.152148022377328
The extent of this tumors is clearly illustrated by use of an angiography.	6.168646923659059
Because of the familial predisposition, clinical and radiological examinations of relatives are mandatory.	4.555702424479174
In more than 30 years of development of intensive care medicine (ICM), our speciality has acquired moral and ethical standpoints, although not without public pressure and discussions.	6.429733346718148
Special commissions dealing, e.g., with brain death, terminal care, ethics of foregoing life-sustaining treatment in the critically ill, withholding or withdrawing mechanical ventilation, and other issues have meen formed in a number of medical societies.	5.627777625515216
International consensus conferences have helped to clarify some of the issues.	6.871587580663641
With increasing experience, a multitude of ethical problems have arisen in ICM that have to be dealt with, such as the issue of quality of life.	5.640389939260356
What is an unworthy life?	4.983783476095444
Are we allowed to make judgments for our patients?	7.063422223148794
What is cost-effectiveness in ICM?	4.990772822193021
Other restrictions include bed and equipment shortages in the intensive care unit (ICU), the necessity for triage - undisputed in catastrophe medicine - and how one should proceed in managing elective patients?	5.458056077452146
In situations of limited ICU bed availability, sicker patients will be admitted, sparing out patients who are less ill for observation and those with poor quality of life and poor prognosis.	7.605673059340707
For the future, it will likely be necessary to define the patients who should be admitted to an ICU more than those who should not be admitted.	5.986274507978396
An ICU treatment entitlement index would be directly proportional to the probability of successful outcome and the quality of the remaining life, and would be inversely related to costs for achieving success.	6.7965350584816
The ICU outcome with survival, hospital mortality, and follow-up of ICU patients is considered.	4.880755870500559
DNR (do not resuscitate), the dying patient, terminal care, terminal weaning - DNT (do not treat) - active and passive euthanasia, living wills, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness for ICU patients are defined.	6.838412914885883
Their application in the ICU will be discussed and problems pointed out.	6.2461013369461025
Outcome predictions using scores (APACHE III, SAPS II, MPM) have been developed based on previous experience, but should only be applied to patient groups and for quality assurance in ICUs.	6.1023392946223245
The most frequent and difficult problem in the ICU is the vegetative state, which requires an exact diagnosis.	6.116785353410907
The differential diagnosis from other comatose states such as coma, brain death, and locked-in-syndrome is depicted.	5.941637657054603
The ethics of interrupting life-sustaining treatment in critically ill patients have been worked out by a Task Force on Ethics of the Society of Critical Care Medicine (1990).	6.403219396802137
A consensus was found that the patient may judge to forego therapy; ethically it is then appropriate to withhold or withdraw therapy.	7.257676655907347
According to the consensus, withdrawing an already initiated treatment should not necessarily be regarded as more problematic than a decision not to initiate treatment.	7.686136991822707
In my mind, however, there is a great difference between withdrawing or withholding, e.g., ventilation.	3.9827543315913436
A dissentive opinion by some members of the Task Force stated that hydration and nutrition other than high-technology or parenteral nutrition are key components of patient care, and should not be equated with medical intervention.	7.436354110227937
The ethical problems associated with active euthanasia (physician-assisted suicide or death) as practised in the Netherlands are also discussed.	6.705250936973732
In most countries this practice seems unacceptable.	6.2353276240669935
From 30 years experience in ICM, there are many more ethical questions and case reports without clear solutions.	7.030467443517711
Care decisions for single patients in unacceptable situations should be made after medical evaluation by the intensivist with the medical team and, if possible, by the patient and/or his or her surrogate.	6.289202322863229
Legislation and solutions cannot be expected for single patients, but ethics committees could be helpful in decision-making.	6.458836031863387
Pseudarthroses of the spine are classified into congenital, acquired non-traumatic, posttraumatic and postoperative (iatrogenic) pseudarthroses.	6.719545006448931
The various types of non-unions of the spine are described according to their clinical and radiological appearance.	3.7276381838451336
In line with their clinical importance, special attention with respect to the operative treatment is given to non-union of the axis of C2 and to spondylolysis.	5.095101211072064
For the pseudarthrosis of the dens a posterior fusion according to Gallie-Brooks is recommended, in spondylolyses without marked slipping a "direct repair" should be considered in young patients.	6.94675894047891
207 osteosarcomas were examined morphologically after neoadjuvant chemotherapy according to the COSS-86 protocol using representative slides of one whole tumor plane.	8.070579869559474
The rate of responders 63 %.	3.5291410023847636
In relapse-free patients both the whole tumors and the vital areas there of were smaller than in patients with relapse during a follow-up period of 5 years.	5.654916999512938
Within the subgroup of osteoblastic osteosarcomas, metastases were observed following smaller tumors than in chondroblastic osteosarcomas.	6.179288148436839
Therefore, in addition to degree of regression, histological subtype and tumor size should be considered in the prognostic evaluation of osteosarcomas.	5.967022470290867
The possibilities of using different material combinations for the replacement of knee joint endoprostheses are very limited.	7.002982393001204
Therefore, cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloys are currently being used for femoral components and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene for tribologically stressed tibial components.	8.026406992855447
Titanium alloys can be considered for the tibial component only.	5.485056431772451
The fixation of hamstring grafts in ACL reconstruction requires a connector device.	7.011683306906091
During the process of ingrowing the graft stability depends entirely on the fixation.	6.04202880236417
The following study focused on the mechanical conditions of no 6 Ethibond, 5 mm Mersilene tape and 5 mm Polylene tape.	6.962673422795368
The material were tested as loops with a length of 30 mm including the knot similar to intraoperative conditions.	8.164621582056437
The ultimate tension load and elongation of the conditioned and unconditioned loops were investigated under cyclic load of 50 N and 100 N using a tension load machine.	8.556536644154974
The ultimate tension load increased significantly only for Mersilene from 416 N to 462 N. However, the highest ultimate tension load showed Polylene with 479 N. The oscillating load up to 100 N revealed for unconditioned loops and elongation of 4.1 mm for Ethibond, 2.9 mm for Polylene and 5.4 mm for Mersilene.	7.316983315056019
The elongation decreased significantly for the conditioned loops to a maximum of 1.4 mm.	5.6360738447693395
Concerning the amplitude during the period of oscillating load there was found a significant reduction as well.	6.4398589827317965
Based on our results Polylene showed the best mechanical properties.	5.234571738274256
Regardless the intraoperatively used material we advocate the conditioning of the loops before anchoring the hamstring graft in ACL reconstruction.	8.246048974657086
On the basis of the results of 327 knee arthroscopies in children aged between 2 and 17 years in the period from 1985 to 1995 we attempt to evaluate the current status of this procedure.	5.479561759367326
Arthroscopy as a diagnostic intervention in trauma with haemarthrosis or in any kind of knee effusion is progressively being replaced by sophisticated ultrasound techniques or MRI.	8.022451252297804
This trend shows a predominant therapeutic use of knee arthroscopy.	6.369623949654497
Taking our own "incorrect" clinical diagnoses as a starting point we look at common problems in the accurate clinical examination of the symptomatic knee in younger children.	7.972332119265575
Rational utilization of all kinds of modern diagnostic measures will reduce purely diagnostic arthroscopies in favour of therapeutic endoscopic interventions thus reducing perioperative risks to a minimum.	7.529026316398398
The pathogenesis of cortical blindness as a rare complication in severe preeclampsia is still unclear.	5.563734429342216
The case of a women with postpartum blindness is reported in which CT and MRI initially showed cortical and subcortical edema in the parieto-occipital lobes.	6.904009243818585
At this time cerebral angiography and transcranial color-coded sonography (TCCS) revealed widespread cerebral vasospasm.	7.135165990537111
Mean blood flow velocities in the middle and posterior cerebral artery and carotid syphon initially reached 380 cm/s and normalized within 2 weeks.	6.315094727299647
While the patient's vision improved rapidly, follow-up MRI disclosed ischemic lesions and petechial hemorrhage in the occipital cortex.	7.586786873094982
This case provides rare documentation that transient blindness in patients with preeclampsia may result from parieto-occipital ischemia due to cerebral vasospasm.	6.647858152437781
In such patients TCCS may be useful to detect vasospasm associated with preeclampsia/eclampsia.	6.41999703309849
The principle of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for rheumatoid arthritis consists in specifically concentrating a drug (photosensitizer) in the synovium.	5.734524589115059
Subsequent activation of the photosensitizer by means of a laser leads to a cytotoxic effect.	5.484913762220516
The practicability of PDT was tested in an animal model of IgG-induced arthritis in rabbits.	5.84494808198637
Photosan-3, 5-aminolevulinic acid and BPD-MA were administered intraarticularly or intravenously.	5.947616682950415
In this model, concentration of the photosensitizer in the synovial lining cells, the lymphoid infiltrate, and the skin was seen.	6.284304055212981
After laser irradiation a selective demarcation and destruction of the synovium by prior administration of Photosan-3, not constant by BPD-MA and without therapeutic effect by 5-aminolevulinic acid, was observed.	7.037679808535829
In contrast, bradytrophic tissues such as cartilage, meniscus, and ligament structures were changed neither macroscopically nor microscopically in all series.	7.0649749827486765
PDT thus offers ideal preconditions for minimal invasive treatment of chronic inflammatory joint diseases because of its selectivity and efficacy.	7.169260324156196
Photodynamic laser therapy can be considered a new method in the surgical treatment of inflammatory disease of the synovial membrane.	3.3907009824835344
The purpose of the study was to identify associations between drug prescriptions and the risk of falls in community-dwelling frail elderly people.	5.335121105861831
Enlargement of the prostate is an age-related, physiological process that is unique in human tissue.	6.125987147066548
The prostate gland is the most common site of neoplastic disorders in men.	5.493178912886057
Despite the growing impact of the various prostate diseases in terms of morbidity and mortality, the pathogenesis of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer remains poorly understood.	4.568870294450807
This reflects the complex composition of the gland with different anatomic, cellular and functional compartments that are differentially involved in benign and malignant disease processes.	7.946577208017502
The present review summarizes new concepts on the morphogenesis of normal and abnormal growth in the human prostate.	6.704731010630953
There is increasing evidence that prostatic stem cells are located in the basal cell layer that is basically involved in normal growth and the development of glandular hyperplasia and prostate cancer.	6.1730705432184445
High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia is considered the most likely precursor of clinically important cancer of the peripheral zone.	6.380629157827379
Severe differentiation and proliferation abnormalities occur during malignant transformation of the prostatic epithelium.	7.021985363961378
These premalignant changes are associated with abnormal expression of growth factor receptors, oncogene and suppressor gene products and genetic instability.	6.637257683854
During the process of stromal invasion the transformed cells lose their basal cell phenotype and produce basement mem- brane-like matrices.	8.097110267182343
Common prostate cancer is mainly composed of exocrine cell types that remain androgen-responsive even in hormone-independent disease.	8.661288788115371
The frequent occurrence of neuroendocrine differentiation in common prostate cancer reflects the differentiation potency of its stem cells.	8.233014225370916
The endocrine phenotype derives from exocrine tumor cells via intermediate (amphicrine) cell types.	8.108418540512183
Neuroendocrine tumor cells consistently lack the nuclear androgen receptor and represent an androgen-insensitive cell population in prostate cancer.	7.444165034767506
Questionnaires were mailed anonymously to 150 German shock wave centers.	6.518095097259638
Twenty questions addressed the following areas of interest: - Facilities of the extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) center (technical, personnel, laboratory, etc.)	4.324146980372632
- Cooperation at ESWL center with referring urologists - Laboratory facilities versus actual metabolic work-up.	7.548117132232666
The return rate was 114 of 150 (76 %).	4.180986029432883
Surprisingly, at 58 % of the centers the average number of treatments is less than two per day.	5.04382212219349
In 30 % of the centers only chemical stone analysis is done!	5.258507387733404
The final conclusion was that ESWL has largely replaced the causal metabolic work-up and subsequent metaphylaxis as a symptomatic measure against urolithiasis.	7.919253804615473
Based on current insurance data patients with pseudophakia can be expected to suffer reduced stereoacuity.	7.034408088333528
A prospective study was carried out to test this relationship.	2.7180120560351537
In 1970 Aulhorn and Harms made fundamental recommendations for the night driving ability of motorists as well as for the corresponding examination methods.	7.394721721679506
Reduced night driving ability of persons over the age of 60, as well the established limits for twilight vision and glare sensitivity, and their relevance to night-time collisions has been re-examined.	7.787671551505456
Hernias of the obturator foramen are rare.	5.317982616472953
They are described mostly in elderly female patients in poor health.	7.631212122903494
Often the correct diagnosis is stumbled upon as a result of surprising intraoperative findings.	5.513618864989358
Surgical therapy is indicated often by the clinical symptoms of an incarcerated hernia.	4.7977574025314444
Herniation of the entire urinary bladder with hemorrhagic infarction has never been described before.	6.078339603113097
For an anatomical reduction of the hernia it was neccesary to resect the superior pubic ramus.	6.8821875063563445
For plastic reconstruction a marlex mesh was used.	5.673436197007248
ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon graft has become a standard procedure.	5.68477545524011
The graft can be inserted either using two tunnels and a lateral femoral incision or with a femoral half tunnel drilled from the joint, thus avoiding the lateral incision.	7.0145359641222464
Advantages of the single-incision technique in the early rehabilitation period have been claimed.	7.329291908069903
40 patients with ACL deficiency were included in a prospective randomized trial comparing single and two-incision technique with a follow-up period of 4 years.	4.777163976382544
Preoperative data did not show any significant difference between the two groups.	2.1612985216431735
At follow-up no differences were observed with respect to complications or the progress of rehabilitation.	5.115424501363954
Evaluation after 1 and 4 years according to the IKDC form revealed good to excellent results in 70 % of all patients.	5.910678621747864
The Tegner-score increased significantly, however most patients did not regain their former activity level.	7.687880786343466
ACL-reconstruction reduced anterior translation of the knee significantly at 6 months follow-up.	6.270226279299072
However, we observed a slight increase of anterior translation after 1 and 4 years in both groups; stability was comparable in both groups at all time periods.	5.583355525056977
We conclude that an arthroscopic singleincision technique has no advantage compared to a mini-open two-incision technique for ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon graft in terms of subjective or objective parameters.	7.667404188716522
For determining the prevalence of multiple sclerosis (MS) in Germany, the outcomes of several epidemiological studies are available.	3.725929966973721
If these rates are transferred to Germany as a whole, figures result of 67,000 to 138,000 MS patients in all.	8.008996128174347
The differing prevalence rates may be caused by various problems in finding patients, the epidemiological area, and different population structures.	5.910769269843264
To avoid these difficulties, a new approach for calculating the number of patients with diagnosed MS was chosen based on representative samples taken from the groups of physicians involved in MS treatment.	6.667135471180798
The disadvantage of this approach is that it does not allow any questioning of the diagnosis.	5.049812811165806
Projecting the results in this way and their subsequent compilation - taking "double treatments" into consideration - showed a total of 122,000 patients with diagnosed multiple sclerosis in Germany.	6.90967520861781
This figure corresponds to a prevalence rate of 149.1 per 100,000 inhabitants and is within the range found by Poser et al.	7.219675235280518
[19]: 127 per 100,000 excluding the diagnostic category "possible multiple sclerosis" and 170 per 100,000 including it.	6.791399704194952
The chemical synthesis of alkyl glucuronides, which appear as metabolites in urine after the consumption of beverages containing congeners of ethanol, is described.	7.402077879851177
Glucuronides of the following alcohols were synthesized: methanol, d5-ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, isobutanol, R-(-)-2-butanol, S-(+)-2-butanol, isopentanol and S-(-)-2-methylbutanol.	5.692099351535754
The retention indices of acetyl, pentafluorpropyl (PFP) and trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives are given and discussed in relation to the chemical structures.	8.251985348560849
Mass spectra of homologous derivatives were shown to be very similar but some fragments were specific for the chain length of the alkyl moiety and can be used for identification and a quantitative estimation of glucuronides in urine samples.	7.562792226459034
Decreasing numbers of tuberculosis cases in the western countries have led to diminished attention towards this disease.	7.1072435329337225
But worldwide, tuberculosis still is the leading cause of mortality due to any one single infectious agent.	4.875152128820078
In the industrialized countries, immigration, growth of low-income groups and increasing numbers of immunocompromised patients, mainly due to the HIV epidemic, supply a reservoir for tuberculosis.	6.479369542792197
Five efficient STR systems were investigated by automated laser fluorescence analysis on an A.L.F.	7.971616545812863
The system HumACTBP2 and the combinations of the systems HumVWA/FGA and HumTH01/D12S391 in duplex reactions were analysed.	8.15100529367007
DNA samples could be analysed with a high sensitivity (100 pg) and the results were reproducible.	5.149877803349507
No allele drop-out was observed.	6.344801135792304
Using specific allelic ladders, the inter and intra gel deviation was less than 0.5 bp.	6.184557162142189
The allele frequencies, the mean exclusion chance values and the discrimination power  for all five systems are shown.	6.5852928418339225
The combination of the five systems resulted in a power of discrimination of 99.9999989%.	6.640559298766312
Few technological developments have impacted health sciences over the last years like the internet.	7.066745169472529
This comes at a time when electronic acquisition, storage and processing of medical data becomes commonplace in the so-called developed countries.	6.433194769337051
New forms of integrated medical services will eventually evolve from these two trends.	8.074845104179122
For information taken from many medical resources on the internet a relative lack of review processes requires special care and selection.	8.622433532281011
The co-operation of different health providers can be facilitated using technological standards initially established for other purposes.	7.148339528681997
This article is directed towards the gynecologist interested in practical use of the internet and its technologies and critically reviews the value of sample sites on the net.	7.699790953041589
The accompanying internet website lists relevant resources.	6.342374206332682
A calculation model was developed for the cost of stone therapy and metaphylaxis in Germany based on estimates of stone incidence, types and recurrence rates, actual costs for stone removal and metaphylaxis (based on data from a district of the social health care system).	6.982805443572748
There are 200,000 stone recurrences per year in Germany.	6.876922928739592
Cost for treatment of these stones amount to $687,000,000.	7.295466470375774
Stone metaphylaxis reduces the recurrence rate by some 40 %.	5.715138062632596
The annual cost for stone removal could be lowered by $275,300,000.	7.626640690067352
Metabolic evaluation/metaphylaxis amount to $70,100,000 per year, resulting in an net saving of $205,200,000.	7.238458716962451
In 1997, there were 96 days off-work per stone patient resulting in 5,800,000 days off-work in Germany per year.	7.884367795042968
Metaphylaxis in stone formers can lower health care cost significantly.	7.534556240221801
Although health care conditions may vary from country to country, in principle this calculation model is applicable also to other countries.	7.608438417915788
Consideration of estrogen replacement therapy is well established in the treatment of postmenopausal syndrome and osteoporosis in menopause.	5.633798625094946
Some observational epidemiologic studies on this topic have suggested beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease.	7.389527501721049
A prospective, controlled, randomized clinical trial with respect to cardiovascular events and mortality in postmenopausal hormone users, the HERS (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement) study has recently been published.	5.92546003583972
Antiischemic effects of estrogens are mediated by improvement of menopausal-associated endothelial dysfunction, calcium antagonism, and activation of endothelial synthesis of prostacyclin.	7.7668127418957384
Improvement in functional state and reduction of stress-induced myocardial ischemia with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) have been demonstrated in several clinical trials.	5.49861451644059
Inflammatory stimuli induce the expression of adhesion molecules on leukocytes and endothelial cells.	5.190980799979701
The adhesive forces between leukocytes and the vascular endothelium are antagonized by the shear stress of the flowing blood.	7.893699938247042
The aim of this study was to examine how differences in the apparent wall shear rate measured in iris venules with varying caliber affect leukocyte-endothelium interaction.	6.877868901207505
Radiologic means aid in assessment of the most suitable side for operation and allow the surgeon to be prepared for special situations in order to perform the operation without difficulties [22].	6.86771596035213
The most suitable modalities are CT and MRI preoperatively.	5.4821683134522585
In uncomplicated cases, conventional imaging suffices for the postoperative needs.	5.962967798091484
CT should only be performed if the patient complains of symptoms.	5.574756330384099
Systemic immunotherapy, notably with interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon- (IFN), has yielded a response rate of 10 % to 30 % in metastic renal cell carcinoma.	3.6350082466590163
However, systemic immunotherapy is limited by severe side effects, and long-lasting response is rare.	4.534030986636351
Tumor palliation and quality-of-life are important end points for evaluating the clinical benefits of immunotherapy.	6.236419457916538
Experimental and clinical treatment models have proved that local IL-2 application is less toxic than systemic treatment and is therapeutically effective.	7.516938457620427
Here we report long-term experience with inhalation IL-2 therapy in 188 patients who had progressive pulmonary metastatic renal cell carcinoma.	6.806019071663391
High-dose inhalation of IL-2 was used with low-dose systemic IL-2 or IFN.	6.18266408633771
Maximal toxicity over the total treatment time was mild, and the low incidence of WHO grade 3 toxicity (24 %) allowed social activities and peformance of social roles.	6.284694560188957
Comedication for systemic side effects was required only in half of the patients.	5.19984487300379
Inhaled IL-2 prevented progress of pulmonary metastases in 68 % of patients for a median period of 9.8 months.	5.800606156362851
Median survival was 12.4 months compared with the expected 5.3 months and quality-of-life did not differ substantially from pretreatment status.	5.605897565665023
Local treatment can be applied alone or in combination with systemic therapy and can increase therapeutic efficacy.	4.874594372913163
It is now well known that chronic alcohol abuse is an important factor for developing head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).	4.347868534523556
While hospitalized, these patients are at great risk for developing an unexpected alcohol-withdrawal syndrome.	6.794038840156989
Compared to common markers of alcohol abuse, carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) has been found to be more sensitive and specific.	5.7475975684391
It is therefore very useful for detecting alcoholism and controlling compliance of alcohol withdrawal.	7.001288356138579
We analyzed the serum concentrations of CDT, liver enzymes and mean corpuscular volume in 49 male patients with HNSCC.	6.349155720160836
Elevated CDT levels were found in more than 25% of patients who earlier denied a history of chronic alcohol abuse.	5.917919980116023
Over one-third of these patients developed an alcohol-withdrawal syndrome.	4.933692609436924
These findings demonstrated that analysis of elevated CDT serum levels was a valuable method for detecting chronic alcohol abuse and recognizing patients at risk for developing an alcohol-withdrawal syndrome postoperatively.	8.090980563265736
Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, plays an essential role in specific cell deletion during normal embryonal and adult development.	6.088193724963264
Apoptotic cells are characterized by fragmentation of nuclear DNA and formation of apoptotic bodies.	6.652143967261294
Molecular genetic analysis has revealed the involvement of several deaths and survival genes that are regulated by extracellular and intracellular factors.	7.833739202886232
There are multiple inducers and inhibitors which interact with target cellspecific receptors and transduce signals involved in cellular proliferation, cell cycle progression and programmed cell death.	8.030953542917898
The elimination of tumor cell populations by applying lethal doses of chemotherapeutic agents or radiation is a well-established strategy in cancer therapy.	7.3971233199688005
Although improved cytotoxic chemo- and radiotherapy regimens are available, the efficacy of these strategies is still disappointing with regard to many solid tumors.	5.851737649156057
Better understanding of the molecular mechanism of apoptosis, including death genes, death signals, receptors and signal transduction pathways, will provide new approaches in the development of strategies to regulate malignant cell survival and death.	6.046983701302793
Recent discoveries in the field of apoptotic cell death promise to have a significant impact on antitumor therapies.	5.323373665939048
Apoptosis is known to be an active process which can be artificially manipulated by several molecular pathways.	6.674975220555401
This information concerning the regulation and induction of programmed cell death might lead among otherthings, to the development of new powerful means to eliminate malignant cell populations of otherwise resistant genitourinary tumors such as prostate cancer.	7.029895744516246
We report on a 63-year-old female patient with Muir-Torre syndrome (MTS).	4.0332036159032585
In the course of this disease two carcinomas of the colon, a kerato-acanthoma and multiple sebaceous gland tumours, including four sebaceous gland tumours, including four sebaceous carcinomas, appeared.	5.473583975160969
This case is thought to be a heriditary form as one of daughters was also found to have a sebaceous epithelioma.	5.513214623907502
MTS is a mostly autosomal-dominant disease with the association of sebaceous gland tumours and internal carcinomas.	6.955851658173047
As the malignant tumours only show slight aggressiveness the prognosis is quite favourable.	7.2308918974213015
Oral isotretinoin therapy was successfully used for the inhibition of sebaceous gland proliferation.	6.7392454287738675
A narrower definition is presented and an updated survey of the published cases is given.	6.256846170296196
Furthermore, the histopathologic peculiarities of sebaceous gland tumours, especially of sebaceous gland carcinomas, are discussed and compared to sebaceous gland tumours not connected with MTS.	6.128183753032568
A total number of 100 of the 135 published cases of MTS were included and analysed regarding sebaceous gland tumours and other skin tumours.	7.3808830720205405
The data on internal carcinomas were taken from the work of Cohen et al.	5.808733132059147
(1991) and 11 current cases were added.	4.511216762975939
The rapid development of modern endovascular, microsurgical, and radiation therapies has considerably expanded the treatment options for encephalic arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).	6.842768746703711
Surgery has the longest history.	5.062179638170616
Single or staged intravascular procedures (embolizations) using fast-acting glues, sclerotic agents, and thrombogenic coils serve to reduce the size of AVM to that suitable for extirpation and may reduce the risk of surgery.	7.27899449913078
Radiation ("gamma-knife") therapy, most frequently used in small, non-operable AVMs, is also viewed by some authors as an alternative or even superior tool in small, operable malformations.	6.120382902335142
Partial embolization to reduce the mass-effect of space-occupying AVMs, to reverse diaschisis, and to treat AVM-related seizure disorders is being discussed and practiced.	7.482265563297881
Given the in part competing or even controversial options, the selection of optimal treatment for AVM patients is becoming increasingly difficult.	7.615844813152452
Current management is impeded by the paucity of information on the exact risks of invasive therapies and by insufficient criteria for identifying patients at risk of spontaneous bleeding during the natural course, including the seriousness of such hemorrhage.	7.570434758270864
A new "all in one" sensing device was developed for continuous transtracheal intraoperative monitoring and in situ detection of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) during thyroid surgery.	8.489054008815884
Patients and methods: The new system is based on a double-balloon endotracheal tube with integrated atraumatic stimulating and tracing electrodes.	5.109703920455405
The recurrent laryngeal nerve is stimulated transtracheally and compound action potentials are recorded from the laryngeal muscles.	7.6032503279596035
Fifty-five patients were introduced into a phase-one clinical trial.	5.016505150013378
Thirty-five patients with primary thyroid operations, 20 patients with reoperations, 10 of whom had neck dissections.	5.194823827066133
All patients were evaluated laryngoscopically and phoniatrically by an ENT specialist before and after surgery.	5.872381831675608
Results: Compound muscle action potentials were recorded continuously during the whole operation and responded sensitively to tension and pressure to the nerve.	8.110863616181948
There were no accidental permanent RLN palsies.	5.389904822878084
Conclusion: The new system offers five advantages: (1) it is atraumatic; (2) it is easy to use; (3) it can monitor continuously with an audio feedback to the surgeon; (4) it works outside the operation field; and (5) it is highly sensitive, even indicating reversible irritation to the nerve.	4.935818504699371
The diagnosis of primary malignant bone tumors, which only account for 1% of malignancies in humans, represents quite a challange for the pathologist.	5.475594251833033
Apart from the often overlapping morphology between different entities, heterogeneity within one and the same tumor has to be kept in mind.	5.820227532648906
Furthermore, in most cases the diagnosis must be established based on small biopsy specimens and occasionally even on frozen sections.	6.095777489741428
In this context detailed clinical information including the patient's age and exact localization of the tumor, as depicted by X-ray or MRI, are essential requirements for a correct diagnosis.	5.277544236593479
In addition, multiple biopsies from different tumor sites may be of help.	5.171090640087903
For example, 25% of osteogenic sarcomas (OSA) are chondroplastic.	4.562491017722746
Others may contain areas similar to fibrosarcoma (FSA) or malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH).	5.585408618918222
Since 90% of OSA occur in the second decade of life whereas chondrosarcomas, FSA and MFH usually manifest after the age of 40 years, a biopsy solely composed of malignant chondromatous tissue obtained from a tibial lesion of a 10-year-old child should most likely be considered as part of an OSA.	6.71295344954436
In the differential diagnosis of the so-called small, round cell tumors, which include Ewing sarcoma, malignant lymphoma and small-cell OSA, immunohistochemical staining of the paraffin-embedded material and a molecular biological/genetic work-up of frozen material are most helpful.	6.184206865204613
In this paper the histomorphological characteristics and criteria for differential diagnosis of the most common primary malignant bone tumors are discussed.	4.216292832135225
The care of the patient after primary treatment is very important for both tumor control and patientsi compliance.	6.677373286910134
The aim of this care concept should be the early detection of local recurrences so as to have better secondary treatment (maybe cure) options.	6.631419344246724
If expensive diagnostics are needed to get this information, it is reasonable to order them.	4.838918257418774
If there is no benefit for the patient, regarding survival or with respect to quality of life, clinical anamnesis and examination should be preferred.	4.887326270875546
The effect on pain and heat sensation of monomere non-ionic contrast media with different osmolality was assessed in a randomized double-blind study.	7.169415539825154
Peripheral angiography was performed in 29 patients who suffered from chronic occlusive vessel disease.	5.068702376777935
The two non-ionic contrast media iomeprol and iopentol were applied intraindividually.	7.599298506000537
The contrast media with an iodine concentration of 350 mg/ml had an osmolality of 618 or 810 mosm/kg.	8.342342468959103
A contrast medium volume of 80 or 90 ml was injected in the abdominal aorta.	6.667022253241114
The mean flow was 13.9 ml/s.	4.392482754107429
The two contrast medium injections were separated by an interval of 10 min.	6.364989513213875
No analgesic premedication was given.	4.879169280762974
The pain and heat intensity was semiquantatively measured using a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (no heat/pain) to 100 (intractable heat/pain).	7.377588839397933
The median after the first injection was calculated as 40 for iomeprol and 70 for iopentol.	7.712066661264763
The comparison of heat and pain sensations after the second injection showed a less distinct difference with a scale rating of 60 for iomeprol and of 65 for iopentol.	8.373865372189199
The statistical variance was highly significant (p < 0.01) in favor of iomeprol.	3.3421527538405886
Shampooing is the most common form of hair treatment.	4.4674667395679215
Shampoos have primarily been products aimed at cleansing the hair and scalp.	7.2370830224280684
The diversity of qualities demanded from a good shampoo by today's consumer go far beyond this general function.	8.591916387399474
A cosmetic benefit is expected, and the shampoo formulation has to be tailored to all the possible variations associated with hair quality (dry, greasy, permed, bleached, dyed), age (baby shampoo), care habit (frequency of shampooing) and specific problems relating to the superficial condition of the scalp (dandruff, seborrhea).	7.813152495731212
Selected ingredients of shampoos that have been popular with the consumer are currently under attack because of potential risks associated with their use (e. g. halogenated organic compounds, formaldehyde, musk fragrances, and crude coal tar).	7.568830223708908
Our standard graduate training programs devote limited attention to  the subject of shampoos, and much of the readily available information concerning shampoos is supplied by the industry.	8.368402983245836
We should be increasingly aware that our patients look to us to supply independent information on what can be expected from a shampoo to enable them to make more informed choices at the consumer level.	8.346192101744744
In industrialized countries the rate of sudden cardiac death remains unchanged.	3.9974224232865656
The most frequently encountered structural heart disease in these patients is coronary artery disease.	4.52485793733038
Despite the era of thrombolytic therapy of acute myocardial infarction patients carry an increased risk of sudden cardiac arrhythmogenic death within a time period of one to two years following the acute event.	5.50071010150851
Therefore, risk stratification post-MI before patient discharge is furthermore mandatory.	6.949889989347937
Dysphagia is related to the impairment of food passage from the mouth to the stomach.	6.116456355720674
Globus pharyngis implies the frequent and often painful sensation of a lump in the throat that usually does not interfere with swallowing and may even be relieved by food intake.	8.40404034581251
The diagnosis is based upon a careful history, clinical examination, endoscopy, dynamic imaging (videofluoroscopy, cinematography, videosonography) and electrophysiologic procedures (including pharyngoesophageal manometry, electromyography and pH determinations).	6.487464789631724
Structural lesions of the cervical spine such as diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis are rare causes of dysphagia.	6.29581700325895
Dysphagia following anterior cervical fusion as well as globus and dysphonia due to dysfunction of the vertebral joints are more likely.	7.060908341740466
Symptoms with swallowing fluids indicate a neurogenic origin.	6.507871394187317
Dyscoordinated swallowing, nasal reflux, dysphonia or general weakness may also occur.	7.607038847263471
Chronic aspiration with respiratory compromize is the main consequence in a variety of neurological disorders as well as in cases of postsurgical dysphagia.	5.320149503243839
Relaxation of the upper esophageal sphincter indicates coordinated muscle movement between the pharynx and esophagus.	6.618017016791379
Dysfunction of the pharyngoesophageal segment may lead to cricopharyngeal achalasia.	5.558648281325582
A dyskinetic sphincter commonly represents an extrapharyngeal cause: i.e., disease associated with gastroesophageal reflux.	5.147810344863038
Disorders of the esophageal phase of deglutition can produce retrosternal pain, heartburn, regurgitation and vomiting, as well as laryngeal and respiratory signs.	6.61417604201511
Esophageal motility disorders include lower achalasia, tumors, peptic strictures, inflammatory diseases, drug-induced ulcers, rings and webs.	5.276813895355115
Motility disorders present with aperistaltic, spontaneous contractions, diffuse esophagospasm, or a hypermotile esophagus.	6.958552880221416
Gastroesophageal reflux with esophagitis must always be excluded, especially in patients with a globus sensation.	4.813745328130973
The multiple features of the appearance of the symptoms of dysphagia and globus makes multidisciplinary approach necessary in order to establish a diagnosis and begin effective treatment.	5.908142296226009
Different pest arthropods and dermatophytes occurring primarily in farm animals may be transmissible to man and produce human dermatoses.	8.31762787052934
The movement and cutaneous penetration habits of external parasites often cause crusted papules, severe itching and dermatitis or may damage their hosts by blood-sucking or by sensitizing them to their saliva.	8.754489370568653
Furthermore different dermatophytes should be considered a possible cause of human skin lesions.	4.676803115356856
Farm animals (cattle, pig, poultry, and rabbit) can transmit external parasites (ticks: Ixodes ricinus, Argas reflexus; fleas: Ceratophyllus gallinae, Spilopsyllus cuniculi, and mites: Sarcoptes scabiei var.	8.681406203310853
bovis, Sarcoptes scabiei var.	5.664356065680127
suis, Dermanyssus gallinae, Cheyletiella parasitovorax), and dermatophytes (Trichophyton sp., and Microsporum sp.).	6.5777232157233865
People who have close contact to infested farm animals are more often exposed to epizoonotic infections.	7.616110008160831
Certain professions, such as farmers, and veterinarians, are especially vulnerable.	5.514097281078437
Between 1992 and 1994 two multicentre studies were performed in order to determine the frequency of sensitization to gold salts.	4.331787794807322
In the first study (1992-1993), 872 patients were tested with gold sodium thiosulfate (NTS) 0.25% in Vaseline (V), 0.5% V. and with potassium dicyanoaurate (KDC) 0.002% aqueous solution.	5.685614099777887
44 patients (5.1%) had a positive patch test reaction to gold salts: 40 (4.6%) to NTS 0.5% V., 20 (2.3%) to NTS 0.25% V. and 5 (0.6%) to KDC.	3.3452825276298213
A higher number of positive patch tests to gold salts was noted in patients also sensitized to another metal salt (8.5%) as compared to those who showed no other sensitivities (3.6%).	5.258310418702312
Immunologial complications frequently occur during the clinical course in patients with multiple injuries.	4.218797832976529
The increased release of pro-inflammatory mediators during the immunological response to trauma may lead to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and furthermore, to multisystem organ failure (MOF), which is associated with a mortality of up to 80%.	4.086143695426276
The development of multiple organ failure following major trauma is associated with remote organ failure, the dysfunction of organs which were not initially affected by the traum.	7.213823566572505
This manuscript reviews recent data in experimental trauma research and offers a more detailed evaluation of the immunological findings in trauma patients.	7.421844891556801
In particular, the role of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the development or SIRS, MOF and ROF is discussed.	4.654022469485653
Despite the enormous progress in clinical immunology and the available data on trauma-induced immune dysfunction, a large number of questions still remain to be answered before the immunological alterations following severe trauma can be beneficially influenced by immunomodulatory therapeutic efforts.	7.569474978744094
A report on two cases with benign tumors of the atrioventricular node (so-called mesothelioma of the av-node or endodermal inclusions of the heart).	5.380480661214672
In one of the cases the tumor could be the cause of the known electrophysiological disturbance of the conduction system (av-block) and of the sudden and unexpected death.	5.347645248513681
A case of delayed death after a low-voltage accident is presented.	6.882859433662863
At first, an obvious source of electricity was not found.	5.109286912959248
However, electric marks were found on the fingers.	5.6980298213356155
The identification of the conductor was performed by analysis of the metallisation of the electric marks.	5.137058271990634
The location of the probable conductors in a boiler under the hand basin and the discovery in a standing position prior to collapse in a bathtub indicates that the capability to act was preserved for a short time period.	7.480395459738601
In such rare cases death seems to be a result of cardiac arrhythmia resulting in ventricular fibrillation.	6.09456840253543
A 53-year-old man presented a melanotic lung tumor which was based in the bronchus of the left lower lobe and closed the left main bronchus.	6.162731916192943
After laser therapy, left lobectomy with sleeve resection was carried out.	5.44985396376999
Complications after the surgery required resection of the rest of the left lung and thoracoplasty.	5.579319905463954
Based on the histological and immunohistochemical findings, the tumor was classified as a malignant melanoma.	3.109215888657328
There was no past history of an excision or a fulguration of a cutaneous, mucous membrane, or ocular lesion.	6.256399462507076
Examination of the skin and the eyes did not yield any evidence of another primary tumor.	5.7753171962020735
We conclude that the lesion represents a primary malignant melanoma of the respiratory tract, a rare neoplasm of which only 21 cases have been confirmed.	3.969975854309901
The patient does not have any evidence of tumor in the relatively short follow-up period of 10 months.	4.004184795232923
Background: To find out the incidence of spontaneous pubertal development in girls with Turner syndrome we investigated patients with a bone age of at least eleven years.	6.37025247449679
Results: 6 out of 17 patients showed spontaneous puberty.	5.588087320660681
There exists no clear correlation between karyotype and phenotype on the one hand and incidence of spontaneous puberty on the other.	6.180585354836338
Basal as well as stimulated gonadotropin levels in the late childhood could better indicate spontaneous puberty in Turner syndrome.	6.7626514140681575
Conclusion: In contrast to the generally held opinion spontaneous pubertal development is not rare in girls with Turner syndrome.	6.532558595734432
Therefore estrogen replacement therapy should be started only after it became certain that there will be no spontaneous puberty.	7.763947825622755
From January 1992 until April 1995, 31 patients with trans- and suprasphincteric anal fistulae (transsphincteric n = 21; suprasphincteric n = 4; transsphincteric in Crohn's disease n = 6) underwent a fistulectomy followed by closure of the internal opening by suture and anocutaneous flap.	6.796760162622394
All patients had undergone previous operations, some several times.	5.13683836990868
The recurrence rate of 13 % appeared to be low after a short follow-up.	4.154806287587762
Continence was only negligibly impaired, although the anal resting pressure and contraction pressure were significantly reduced.	7.003210111765405
In five patients a shortened prewarning period was noticed.	6.1911630938086955
Also in Crohn's fistulae the results were equivalent when the surgical treatment was performed in a non-inflammatory period.	5.7476995368782235
Staging of malignant tumours of the oral cavity and the oropharynx not only requires far more than a basic knowledge of anatomy and the usual pathways of spread, but also a broad understanding of the diagnostic benefits of current imaging modalities.	6.702816933298905
As radiology should never try to replace histology, the main aim should be precise prediction of tumour margins and differention of tumour from edema and posttherapeutic changes.	7.767470823823368
Only then will imaging studies have a significant clinical impact.	6.583469908778454
Post-traumatic recurrent dislocation is a major problem in the operative treatment of shoulder dysfunction in young athletes.	4.792282437367047
This prospectively designed study evaluates the long-term results of a modified Eden-Hybinette procedure in young male athletes.	6.292002836512708
The criteria were: capacity in sports, functional limit, and persistent pain.	6.006329760507833
Genuine disorders of the glenoid or muscular imbalance of the shoulder joint were criteria for exclusion.	6.339127926966239
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a disorder which primarily affected the myocardium.	6.70731903197722
It is characterized by a hypertrophic left ventricle that shows normal systolic function but impaired diastolic relaxation.	6.955143530421779
The most important complication of HCM, sudden cardiac death, is mainly responsible for a mortality of approximately 3.5% in childhood.	4.233056333832275
While most patients remain asymptomatic for years, there are some reports about patients progressing from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to a dilative form within years.	7.250502790320577
A prospective study was performed on 72 patients with osteochondritis dissecans (OD) of the knee and ankle to compare plane radiography, MRI and arthroscopy before therapeutic procedures.	6.029324020573034
Special interest was placed on the assessment of fragment stability with radiological methods for staging related therapy.	6.830892139622902
OD was localized in 46 cases on the femoral condyle and in 26 cases on the talus.	6.322958906329605
Radiological methods were performed simultaneously and shortly before definite arthroscopical therapy.	6.943959351411038
Using conventional radiography, OD of the condyles was staged according to the classification of Rodegerdts and Gleissner and OD of the talus suggested by Berndt and Harty.	7.166742880587813
MRI staging was performed by morphology of the interface of the OD.	5.44001313300601
Arthroscopical staging based on the classification of Guhl.	5.0093643635035665
There was an excellent correlation between the stages in MRI and arthroscopy, showing correct prediction of stable and unstable fragments in 92%.	7.202122234891995
In contrast, fragment stability could not be efficiently assessed by conventional radiology because fragments could be stably fixed in cases of bony separation.	7.2364593661943575
MRI is indicated before performance of staging-related therapy of OD to select patients with stable fragments for conservative therapy and those with unstable OD for surgical therapy.	8.40272790338197
A case of rupture of the right hemidiaphragm resulting from blunt trauma with complete intrathoracic dislocation of the right hepatic lobe in a multiple trauma patient is presented.	6.9541807933544
After a primary chest X-ray study had been interpreted as showing right-sided hemothorax, the thoracic drainage tube was accidentally placed into the liver.	6.925859597921598
CT revealed a diagnosis of diaphragmatic rupture with intrathoracic liver dislocation.	6.625698309634548
The liver was replaced and the extended dorsal diaphragmatic rupture was closed primarily via an abdominal approach.	7.677824269013586
Problems of diagnosis and operative procedure in rare cases of fresh right-sided blunt traumatic diaphragmatic ruptures are discussed.	6.779825337160862
