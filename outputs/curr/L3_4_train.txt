Precision of osteodensitometric measurements using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) depends on various known factors, such as positioning, aortic calcification or vertebral fractures.	0.9195873035335156
The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of various diseases or bone density on the reproducibility of measurements in the lumbar spine and the proximal femur.	1.0838729599893508
Measurements in the LWS p.a., LWS lat.	0.9647258336254879
and at Ward's triangle were made in a total of 100 patients.	0.9775801571343861
The subjects were repositioned between measurements.	0.5999238441687866
In order to be able to determine the influence of various diseases, four groups of 25 patients each were formed: three with the diagnosis osteoarthrosis, osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis and one control group.	1.1563056356037387
The mean percentual difference and coefficient of variation were calculated as the measure for reproducibility.	0.7822943000430396
Mean percentual differences of 0.18 to 2.6% were found in the four groups at the three measurements sites.	1.3555025272979202
After calculation of coefficient of variation, a value between 1.2 and 2.7% was found for LWS p.a., between 7.1 and 15.7% for LWS lat.	1.4739581945173197
and between 4.1 and 9.9% at Ward's triangle.	1.3600767737457566
It was also conspicuous that the difference in coefficient of variation in osteoporosis patients was nearly double that in the control group in all measured areas.	1.0647967148700284
Conclusion: Lateral lumbar spinal measurements using DEXA cannot presently be recommended.	1.0322302825264968
measurements and, with limitations, measurements at Ward's triangle have good precision and could be used for course documentation of bone density.	1.0722483648686094
Background: We compared the endothelial protective function of two hyaluronic acid viscoelastics (Healon GV, Provisc) of different molecular weight and viscosity during phakoemulsification in high-risk eyes.	1.118106415581078
Diseases of the peripheral nervous system occur in up to 50% of persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).	0.933132738047958
In early stages of the infection, Guillain-Barr√© syndrome or a spontaneously remitting mononeuropathy can occur.	0.7930448165444901
The most frequent occurrence is distal symmetrical polyneuropathy associated with HIV, which can only be treated symptomatically.	1.1252201726660866
The most important differential diagnosis is a drug-induced polyneuropathy under antiretroviral therapy with the nucleoside analogues DDI, DDC, or D4T.	1.1173249739679794
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy is less common and can be treated with immunoglobulins or corticosteroids.	0.9400634980156284
Very rare are steroid-responsive neuropathies with necrotizing vasculitis or in diffuse infiltrative lymphocytosis syndrome (DILS).	0.7859018376630285
In the AIDS stage, polyradiculitis can occur due to opportunistic infections - most often with cytomegalovirus (CMV) or M. tuberculosis - or polyradiculopathies due to lymphomatous meningiosis.	1.120866189963252
Mononeuritis multiplex is rarely seen in disseminated CMV infection.	0.7656230084576505
Myopathies can occur in all stages of HIV infection; their frequency is about 1%.	1.0884213095987807
Primary polymyositis associated with HIV, which can be treated with corticosteroids or immunoglobulin, must be distinguished from myopathy induced by azidothymidine.	0.9398216145293337
Other forms of myopathy are very rare.	0.634870786784199
54 patients, who had been explored at the end of their treatment including a psychosomatic approach in a medical department of a general hospital, were interviewed again in their homes three months later.	1.2099919510062374
Contentment with treatment was high in the inpatient and outpatient setting, the ill felt only moderately stressed by their illnesses, showed an adaptive constellation of coping styles and were surprisingly well adapted.	1.0091146062916079
The comparison between the two measures showed a less favourable view of the patients three months after discharge from hospital at a quarter of the tested parameters, the variability was high in the scales, that were used.	1.304226987925224
Explanations for these results are discussed.	0.8289902938840719
At a long term perspective coping with illness may be improved especially by interventions of the family doctors.	1.0444429033196816
Health care costs have risen considerably since 1970 in all industrialized countries.	0.8328531854410829
This has several causes: changes in demographic structure, the large number of physicians, increased personnel needs resulting from generous vacation and special leave privileges, wage increases and - last but not least - medical progress.	1.0372005751921536
Advances in medical technology are often regarded as one of the main reasons for spiralling costs in health care.	0.9491432787729108
Careful analyses reveal, however, that the high costs of imaging services are due to conventional radiography rather than to high-technology (CT, MR) imaging.	1.2273729844473626
The legitimate demands for cost reduction have to be met with improved cost efficiency while optimal quality standards must also be maintained.	0.8915147606311548
Relevant suggestions, such as generally accepted examination strategies, should be realized with the help of the scientific societies.	1.0007997864690903
Background: Main features of the Coffin-Siris syndrome are mental retardation and absent or hypoplastic nails of the fifth fingers and toes.	0.9861572109962279
Further symptoms are wide mouth with prominent lips, sparse scalp hair, and hypertrichosis.	0.9194650105957977
We report on two premature infants who had completed 25 and 29 weeks of gestation and who developed unilateral interstitial pulmonary emphysema.	1.094196404814223
In both cases massive mediastinal displacement developed with compression and total atelectasis of the contralateral lung.	0.9732243942935083
By selective intubation of the respective main bronchus, complete ventilation of the collapsed lungs and sufficient gas exchange was achieved.	0.978219977636404
After 3 days (case 1) and after 6 days) case 2), the unilateral emphysema receded and, subsequently, bilateral respiration was possible without relapse.	1.235306933237169
6 and respectively 11 days after selective intubation, extubation was performed.	0.7855794789957132
The two children were discharged at the age of 41/2 and 21/2 months showing complete respiratory compensation and equal ventilation on both sides.	0.9787572568405544
Patient with extensive keratosis palmoplantaris maculosa seu papulosa (Davies-Colley) presented with multiple cutaneous horns.	0.803299114179336
The clinical picture, the histology, the electro microscopic examination, the negative tumor screening and the viral classification in the tissue allowed the differentiation from other palmoplantar keratoses.	1.1987428706781331
The patient was treated successfully using a combination of acitretin with physical and chemical measures.	0.9992033104287936
Epidemiologic studies have shown that trace concentrations of inhalation anaesthetics polluting the air of operating theatres could have deleterious effects on the personnel's health.	0.8278928274640424
Nitrous oxide (N2O) oxidises vitamin B12 and thus decreases DNA production by inactivation of methionine synthase.	0.7419164752393704
Therefore, the United States and most European health authorities recommend threshold values to protect against potential health risks.	0.9784421661957046
These values range from 25 to 100 ppm, expressed as time-weighted averages (TWA).	0.8856055097505837
There is a lack of data concerning measurements of trace concentrations under defined conditions.	0.8010321341524113
The aim of this study was to quantify levels of N2O in a recovery room (RR) with an air conditioning system.	1.0578329718306352
The blood loss during the acute period after complex pelvic trauma is finally responsible for the high mortality associated with this specific type of injury.	1.1366783540111935
Several protocols have been published for optimized management, but up to now comparable data are not available as no exact definitions exist judging the severty of trauma and blood loss.	1.1295413181917284
As part of a prospective study 19 patients after unstable pelvic injuries with unstable circulation underwent emergency stabilization by the pelvic C-clamp.	1.0892260966116534
Beside standard clinical parameter the initial hemoglobin value was converted into a "bloodvolume equivalent".	0.8620912362888131
18 of the 19 patients had an injury severety according to group III and IV of the Hannover Polytrauma Score (PTS).	0.9993994138762546
Concommitant abdominal injuries were seen in 12 cases (23 injuries), concommitant urological injuries in 12 cases (14 injuries).	1.118211969476602
In 13 cases the pelvis was the major source of bleeding in 9 cases an additional intraabdominal hemorrhage was observed.	0.9836622153756766
11 patients died due to sequelae of their injury, 8 patients survived.	0.9800311264143566
Although the initial blood loss was comparable both in the group of the deceased patients and the survivors, a 44% higher subsequent blood substitution (= 10 089 ml) was observed in the nonsurvivor group.	1.2802847736369545
In conclusion the data proofed that early control of hemorrhage is fundamental for the prognoses after complex pelvic trauma.	0.8803994255276976
The estimation of the blood loss may help in indicating agressive emergency procedures like emergency stabilisation, pelvic clamps, surgical exploration and tamponade.	1.1011759424772978
This calculation may be a basis for a more detailed analyses of this devastating injury and judging the benefit of different management protocols.	1.0554480742081986
In contrast to childhood intussusception, the clinical signs of intussusception in adults are nonspecific.	1.1663787931058307
Generally organic alterations of the small bowel cause intussusception in adults.	0.8962653270936358
In this case report on a retrograde jejunojejunal intussusception in a 61-year-old male, following removal of an intraoperatively placed intestinal tube for ileus therapy, the clinical symptoms, diagnostic methods and therapy for intussusception are described.	1.111976172216764
Sonography is not only the diagnostic tool of choice in childs, but also led to the correct diagnosis in this case.	1.4650795999720805
In contrast to childhood intussusception, operative treatment is preferred in adults.	1.0371541654450454
The term "frontal lobe syndrome" comprises a variety of different clinical syndromes produced by focal lesions involving the prefrontal cortex.	0.9079395387451291
However, similar syndromes can be observed after lesions involving subcortical structures connected with the prefrontal cortex in neuronal networks.	1.1928595296842923
With respect to the different clinical pictures and underlying brain lesions, prefrontal lobe dysfunction may be divided into a disorganized type, caused by lesion of the dorsolateral prefrontal lobe and its connections, a disinhibited type that can be observed following lesions of the orbitofrontal cortex, and an apathetic type following lesions affecting the functional balance between the cingulum and the supplementary motor area.	1.0808325389106552
As intracerebral lesions are rarely limited to the brain regions described, in the majority of patients various degrees of behavioural dysfunction can be observed.	1.1279767635704736
The case reports of four patients illustrating the three major prefrontal syndroms following severe head injury (n=2) or cerebrovascular disease (n=2) are presented and diagnostic implications as well as possible treatment strategies are discussed.	1.2220382778333778
The measures taken in intensive care medicine are rated differently by the patients, their family, and personnel.	1.092545537497095
A lack of understanding for intensive care therapy can lead to a negative attitude towards intensive care medicine, which in turn makes an impression on public opinion, and disturbs the reputation of the co-workers in intensive care medicine.	1.0747006995242987
To form an objective view, we carried out a survey of 40 co-workers (11 physicians, 23 from the nursing staff, and 6 ancillary personnel) regarding the medical technology, the environment in the unit, general medical questions, and the extent of intensive care therapy.	1.296490973728319
The length of employment in the intensive care unit ranged from 1-240 months (median 18 months), the ages ranged from 21 to 53 years (median 30 years).	1.1663893768089193
Of those questioned 73%  found intensive care medicine in its current form to be purposeful: 100% of the physicians and only 57% of the nursing staff were of this opinion.	1.2967014335349993
Only 9% of the physicians believed the equipment to be fear-inducing for the patients; in contrast, 61% of the nursing staff believed this to be true.	1.3009148260982006
The noise level was rated as very disturbing by 65% of the nursing staff and 45% of the physicians.	1.1138811200649912
Only 22% of the nursing staff believed that the patients felt comfortable and protected on the intensive care unit; 48% felt that they were unhappy or even miserable.	1.0219555805058902
Of the physicians 46% believed that the patients were comfortable.	1.1352736024279295
Of the nursing staff 100% were of the opinion that for the deceased patients, organ substitution therapy had continued too long.	1.1085337662064565
On the other hand, only 45% of the residents shared this opinion.	1.1361922562279045
The medical staff rated the intensive care measures as purposeful, less disturbing for the patients and more effective than did the nursing staff.	1.1974711017284365
In many cases, the nursing staff as a group exhibited a contrary and negative opinion.	1.0889778806172712
This could possibly be caused by insecurity, lack of information and lack of successful experiences.	0.9394113045582196
Next to patient outcome, the competent explanation and information regarding the disease and prognosis and the recurrent communication within the intensive care team, with respect to diagnostic and therapeutic measures are the deciding factors in the opinion formation regarding intensive care medicine.	1.141974943336997
In this pilot study 12 patients with moderate to severe atopic eczema were treated with 2 million IU interferon alpha 2a (Roferon A) three times weekly for 8 weeks and followed up for a further 10 weeks: 2 patients showed clear and 9 a slight to moderate reduction of their skin lesions; 1 patient got worse.	1.1799092197166072
Pruritus did not decrease and even increased in a few patients, and IgE levels showed no change during and after treatment.	1.1678991361280058
All patients noted mild, transient, flu-like symptoms.	0.7625599467561069
The efficacy of interferon alpha in the present therapeutic design for the treatment of atopic eczema must thus be classified as only moderate.	1.074701863057344
Shock secondary to sepsis is a serious common disease with a substantial mortality.	0.9991473226667332
Coagulation abnormalities, ranging from a rapid fulminant state of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) to a slight elevation in the level of fibrin(ogen) degradation products, are well recognized in patients with bacterial septicemia.	1.047075364642954
Therefore, the inhibition of the activated coagulation is one of the first therapeutic steps.	1.1391330463160965
We investigated 30 intensive care patients with septic disease and comparable signs of abnomalities in coagulation at the beginning.	0.9762227049650724
Fifteen patients were treated with 1.5-5 E/kg body weight (Low dose group), the others received 8-15 E/kg (high dose group).	1.2327836640083323
Our study demonstrated a significant stronger and faster decline of coagulation parameters - such as d-dimer, TAT and PTF 1 + 2 - in the High dose group without any bleeding disorder.	1.2434508857184159
Thus, we support in cases of coagulation disease except fulminant ones the high dose therapy with LMWH as shown above.	1.185752780008739
Background: Laparoscopic techniques are currently used for curative resection of colorectal cancer although long-term results from controlled clinical trials are not available yet that prove laparoscopic procedures are adequate.	1.3384938992560322
Methods: All patients who underwent a curative resection of a colorectal tumor from 1995 to 1997 were included in a prospective cohort study to evaluate the short- and long-term results.	1.32235326471959
Results: Laparoscopic colorectal resections were accomplished in 68 patients.	1.0588103449881225
In only 3 patients was an adenoma (stage 0) found, and 10 patients had multiple liver metastases at the time of palliative resection.	1.2499611316689716
An oncological resection was performed in 55 patients.	0.8230499762473776
The average age was 62.8  +/-  14.6 years (29 female and 26 male patients).	1.079891558475678
Eleven right colectomies, 1 left colectomy, 21 sigmoid resections, 16 proctosigmoidectomies and 6 abdominoperineal resections were carried out.	1.0064702291546883
Two patients (3.6 %) were lost during follow-up.	1.1294047082570569
The median follow-up was 27.1 months (range 9.1-45.1 months).	1.4060408585175643
No port-site metastases were found.	0.592903129918265
Two patients who are still alive after sigmoid resection suffered from a recurrence.	1.0873769208883144
The first patient underwent only limited lymphadenectomy because of synchronous malignant lymphoma.	0.8256928181452039
The second patient developed bilateral lung metastases.	0.7756363163937003
Only one patient died during the follow-up period because of myocardial infarction.	1.1487117838793777
Conclusion: Although the follow-up is short, it seems that the recurrence rate is low.	1.4172387903353378
Controlled multicenter clinical trials are currently performed to evaluate whether laparoscopic surgery is really adequate to treat colorectal cancer.	1.1161593283358195
The authors report a tracheal rupture in a 34-year-old patient who was primarily intubated following generalised seizures and loss of consciousness (R√ºsch endotracheal tube).	0.9455440244867854
Some hours later, she developed high ventilatory airway pressures and subcutaneous and mediastinal emphysema were noted.	0.9291524592618069
Reintubation with a high-volume, low-pressure endotracheal tube was planned when it was noted that the ballon of the R√ºsch tube was grossly overinflated.	1.1072270605833958
Endotracheal tube cuff pressure was measured and found to be greater than 120 cm H2O (the maximum measurement possible with the manometer).	1.1365710494183603
The diagnosis of tracheal rupture was confirmed by fiberoptic bronchoscopy.	0.8525773785056063
The patient immediately underwent a throacotomy and a 3-cm tear of the pars membranacea of the trachea was sutured with a dural patch.	1.016132013223761
To maintain low airway pressures post-operatively, she remained sedated for 2 days and received a muscle relaxant to permit pressure-controlled ventilation.	1.0532689541752631
In this case, it can be concluded that excessive inflation of the endotracheal tube cuff resulted in the tracheal rupture.	1.0472187791269645
Other possible causes and results of tracheal rupture are discussed.	0.8352265543890728
Urinary tract infections are the most frequent nosocomial infections, accounting for about 40% of all nosocomial infections.	1.238139276631097
In most cases these infections are associated with indwelling urinary catheters.	0.8637842682779717
The guideline from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, USA) for the prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections, as the most important evidence-based guideline worldwide, was published in 1981 and has not been updated so far.	1.0453817474599603
Evidence-based national guidelines are not available in Germany.	0.8416443261356374
We have, therefore, performed a literature search for randomized, controlled studies on the prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (Medline, Cochrane Library, reference text books) published since 1981.	0.9852693637619598
Fifty studies meeting our inclusion criteria were identified.	0.6474319960917801
Substantial new findings have been published on alternatives to urethral catheters and new catheter materials.	0.9230320369072408
Based upon the CDC guideline, whose principles are still valid, updated guidelines for the prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections have been developed by the National Reference Center for Hospital Hygiene.	0.9654214002253293
Chronic hypoperfusion of the hypogastric arteries due to aortoiliac surgery leads to a complex of symptoms well known as Lerich's syndome.	0.9100026569271751
In contrast, acute ischemia of the pelvic arterial tree leads to lethal complications [2, 4, 5, 9, 10, 12, 13].	1.163781271676206
Acute interruption of the hypogastric perfusion mainly occurs after aortoiliac surgery or after selective transcatheter embolisation of the internal iliac artery for control of pelvic bleeding [1, 8].	1.0154629694631556
Several complications may occur after total occlusion: urinary bladder necrosis [6], left colon ischemia, spinal cord ischemia [10], nerve palsy, necrosis of the rectum and gluteal musculature [2, 11-13].	1.1846680821063384
Despite adequate therapy, mortality is over 70% [2].	1.1824195562521043
We report the case of a 66-year-old patient who survived after acute occlusion of the iliac arteries with gluteal necrosis following replacement of the infrarenal aorta with an aortobiiliacal graft.	0.9525277376420039
As demonstrated in 44 allogeneic sibling (34 HLA identical, 10 HLA mismatched at 1-3 loci) and 6 unrelated (1 HLA-identical, 5 mismatched at 1-3 loci) cord blood (CB) transplantations CB has been shown to be a rich source of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.	1.1378983463908052
Therefore, a scientific pilot project in order to evaluate HLA class I and II typed cord blood samples for unrelated transplantation was initiated.	1.1412054900634507
Hitherto 372 CB samples: mean volume 79 +/-  5x108, were collected from the umbilical cord vein immediately after vaginal full term delivery (n=302) or ceasarean section (n=70) and stored frozen in liquid nitrogen.	1.0682165237351537
Methods for HLA-typing by serology for HLA-class I and II from minimal cell amounts were adjusted that only 1.5 ml of the whole CB was needed for both the HLA-class I and II typing by serology (1 ml) and DNA-typing for HLA-class II (0.5 ml).	1.15676119887838
Only 3.5 additional ml of the CB were required for the AB0 typing, control of sterility, determination of progenitor cells by colony forming assays and CD34 and the analysis of contaminating maternal cells by simultaneous immunophenotypic and genotypic analysis of interphase cells and the PCR using sequence-specific priming (PCR-SSP) for the non-inherited maternal allel.	1.0027443836596395
Mother'sera have been tested for HBsAg, anti-HCV, -HAV, -HIV-1-2, -EBV, -VCA, -HTLVI-II, -CMV, Toxoplasmosis and Syphilis.	1.4764116824196876
Nonepithelial malignant tumors of the pancreas are extremely rare neoplasms with a frequency of ~0,6%.	1.0023690978036923
They are always explored because of a suspected diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma.	1.018505330147066
Amongst the more than 600 primary pancreatic neoplasms in our pancreatic tumor archive only 5 neoplasms were of nonepithelial origin (one was a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor [MPNST], one a leiomyosarcoma, one a malignant mesothelioma, and two were peripheral neuroectodermal tumors [PNET].	1.1983177011270567
The differential diagnosis includes secondary infiltration of the pancreas by mesenchymal tumors of the retroperitoneum, undifferentiated pancreatic carcinoma and, especially in the case of PNET, malignant lymphoma.	1.1965915323255403
Preoperative chemotherapy and down-staging can improve the operability and  prognosis, especially in PNET.	1.0834988698143082
In patients with renal or hepatic failure, the pharmacokinetics of opioids may be affected in several ways, leading to the necessity to correct the dose.	1.1357976749828795
The liver is the major site for biotransformation of most opioids.	0.9471250553681566
The major metabolic pathway is oxidation.	0.5718149568011948
Exceptions to this are morphine and buprenorphine, which undergo primarily glucuronidation, and remifentanil which is cleared by esther hydrolysis.	1.0699318342851352
The hydrophilic metabolites are predominantly excreted by the kidneys and may accumulate in patients with renal insufficiency.	0.9184988933795384
Some metabolites such as morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) or normeperidine are active opioid agonists.	0.953862540587278
With high concentrations they may cause narcotic effects or respiratory depression.	0.8028061518808034
In addition, special risks are known for normepridine that has been shown to exert neurotoxic effects with the risk of seizures.	1.1142700735979039
Few cases of respiratory depression following the administration of codeine, dihydrocodeine and tramdol have been reported.	0.8691538532913681
The elimination half-life of these drugs was prolonged.	1.0153927655505977
Lastly, the disposition of methadone, buprenorphine, fentanyl, sufentanyl and remifentanil appears to be unaffected in renal failure.	0.920127213531219
Backgrounds: Aim of this study was to validate a modification of adults' 13C-urea breath test for children in diagnosis of an infection with Helicobacter pylori.	0.9493001242707828
Methods: In 30 asymptomatic children results of the breath test were compared with results of an ELISA test specific for Helicobacter pylori.	1.1812881142464828
In 10 symptomatic children the breath test result was compared with histological results of gastric mucosa.	0.9885009819108018
Cold orange juice was tested by ultrasonic assessment to be suitable as a test meal.	0.9865626387222812
Results: With the serological or histological result as reference method, the cut-off value for children (delta value = 5 permil) has shown a sensitivity/specificity of 70 %/95 % or 100 %/100 % respectively.	1.409896439121425
Cold orange juice meets the criteria of a test meal by inhibiting the gastric emptying for the duration of the breath test significantly.	0.9675748699195936
30 minutes after 13C-urea ingestion has been the optimal point of time for the second breath sample collection.	0.9829925704552526
Conclusion: Our modification of the 13C-urea breath test for children is suitable to prove an Helicobacter pylori infection.	0.9652469810862795
This review summarizes some aspects of German pediatrics as it developed after world war II.	0.9180988498162738
Having lost its touch with international pediatrics regained its high standard during the late forties and fifties and now develops in concordance with the changing needs and the advances of pediatrics in a highly industialoized nation.	0.8728115818373207
As in other countries, the practice and structure of pediatrics have been influenced by changes in social attidudes and expectations, and by economic restrictions.	1.0449923912973875
National specifics are the high number of practicing pediatric population and emphasis on a highly structured and formalized preventive care program under a public health plan.	0.8950615718737909
The need for critical evaluation of this program is emphasized as is the need for better communication among subspecialties.	0.8922779520165884
Aim of this study was to isolate T lymphocytes from atheromatous plaques and to determine they respond to Chlamydia antigens.	0.9432157216674927
In recent years, mumps orchitis has become a rarely reported disease.	0.8875680734378556
However, since October 1994 a clear increase in the incidence of this disease has been observed.	1.3861257666015694
At four hospitals in the Saarland, Germany, 45 cases of mumps orchitis in adolescents and adults were diagnosed in this period.	0.9746869909812769
In addition to the case history and clinical findings, the diagnosis was confirmed by an increased IgM titer.	1.254942025720178
None of the patients had been previously vaccinated.	1.406276377634703
The main reason for this was a lack of parental knowledge of the necessity for this vaccination, one which has almost no side effects.	1.0718332688023824
The goal of this study is to describe the disease, present our own results, and indicate the need for vaccination.	1.117306922897214
In addition to providing information, a further aim of the study is to increase the motivation of adolescents and adults for vaccination.	1.2395194050793534
Although many treatments for mumps have been published in recent years, the most successful therapy is still prophylactic vaccination.	1.1426456485555283
Neurofibromas, caf√© au lait macules and freckles in the axillary or inguinal regions are common manifestations of von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis (NF-1).	0.8241650035141642
Less known is the simultaneous appearance of dermal melanocytic naevi.	0.7852319868139187
We describe the case of a 21-year-old Vietnamese woman who showed generalized, multiple neurofibromas, a solitary plexiform neurofibroma in the left gluteal region and Lisch nodules.	1.1828708496965468
In addition, there were several large grey-blue macules histologically characterized by fusiform pigment-bearing cells in the dermis, which we diagnosed as persistent aberrant mongolian spots.	1.0918194798465775
In the right zygomatic region she presented a grey-blue, hair-bearing macule, which we saw as a variant of Ota's naevus.	1.0901448572189874
A genetic background for this coincidence of a systemic with a local phakomatosis can be supposed, as both Schwann's cells and melanocytes are derived from the neural crest.	1.016351889973928
Such pathologic rearrangement in the embryogenesis of the cellular elements could be important for the pathogenesis of NF-1 and dermal melanocytic nevi.	1.0405325767481484
Infectious agents may directly or indirectly (through the response of the host's immune system) modulate the growth of vascular cells.	0.8806070275590284
Local and/or systemic increase of cytokines could influence the extent of (re-)stenosis in the vascular tree.	1.1777073158970761
Further studies in this field may identify patients at a high risk for atherogenesis and restenosis.	1.1259682748247515
Their results should be helpful in treating restenosis after percutaneous coronary interventions.	0.7931659618469344
Besides other reasons, cost containments mandate the rational use of preoperative screening tests which should be adapted to the risk of the individual patient.	0.9935694282236882
Since the perioperative cardiac risk increases with age, elderly patients in particular require a thorough evaluation of their perioperative risk.	0.9854804597349482
Routine ECG, however, is not indicated in patients under 45 years of age who do not present with signs or history of preexisting cardiac diseases but should be performed on a routine basis in all patients over 45 years of age.	1.1394938451577774
The validity of an ergometer test as a preoperative indicator of myocardial ischemia is limited due to a high incidence of false negative results.	1.0114688833859542
By preoperative routine chest radiography previously unknown findings are only detected in a small number of patients; thus, in patients of ASA-risk groups I-II younger than 74 years of age routine chest-x-ray cannot be justified.	1.2359024736288542
In patients whose perioperative cardiac risk as assessed clinically and by ECG is ambiguous, dipyridamole-thallium-myocardial scintigraphy (DTMS) and dobutamine-stress-echocardiography may contribute valuable information regarding the prediction of perioperative adverse cardiac events.	0.9734457776220372
In that respect, dobutamine-stress-echocardiography appears to be superior to DTMS.	0.8066092227738553
The laboratory tests required in patients of different ASA-risk groups and according to their age are presented in an overview.	1.0197029780281082
Generalized muscle weakness in critically ill patients can result in prolonged periods of artificial ventilation and longer stays in the intensive care unit.	0.8225203554066951
Both neuropathic (critical illness polyneuropathy) and myopathic (critical illness myopathy) abnormalities seem to play an important role for this prolonged weakness.	1.0318495404917758
This article reviews its complex differential diagnosis with special emphasis on the current understanding of the neuromuscular syndromes.	1.1394721798204883
An efficient diagnostic plan is necessary for the exclusion of other curable causes of prolonged muscle weakness even in the presence of polyneuromyopathic changes.	0.9195495520620388
Psychological support of the patient and prophylaxis of secondary complications of prolonged immobilization are crucial when specific therapy is not possible.	1.1102452434321743
Modern ultrasonic diagnostic instruments with high resolution and color Doppler sonography allow the obstetrician to describe pathological findings very precisely and at an early stage of pregnancy.	0.9033618687957344
The use of high-resolution ultrasound makes it possible to detect heart malformations already between the 8th and 10th week of gestation.	0.9194674076432668
This development has essentially changed the clinical requirements on fetal autopsy which in its traditional way no longer meets the increased demands.	0.8842936995544338
Unless the pathologists faces this challenge the importance of fetal autopsy will diminish.	0.7876513252942348
Modern image databases and communication techniques allow the pathologist to have direct access to text and images of pre-findings by other clinics.	0.8355361705793253
Great importance, however, must be attached to the interdisciplinary cooperation with obstetricians and geneticists.	0.9603471688515495
We report on routine fetal autopsy by using an interdisciplinary database an the Charit√©.	1.1324512051568654
Infrainguinal arterial reconstruction for intermittent claudication has been discouraged because of fear of bypass graft failure, significant perioperative complications, and limb loss.	0.9973090523312129
This may be worse than the natural history of the disease.	0.8021913522020737
In our study, we retrospectively evaluated all infrainguinal bypass procedures performed in the past 10 years.	1.1310194507209461
Radiosurgery represents a minimally invasive radiologic method for the treatment of intracranial tumours and arteriovenous malformations.	0.9244066672168649
In 1994 the radiosurgical device 'Leksell Gamma Knife' (LGK) was installed in a dedicated logistic environment for outpatient treatments.	0.8875835113057865
High quality requirements have to be met for radiosurgery.	0.8298215913181417
The target point accuracy taking into account the whole system was shown to be reliably below 0.5 mm whereas the spatial therapeutic resolution was 0.035 cm3.	1.1322961348077039
Quality parameters of the dose plan were evaluated for the first 500 consecutive treatments.	1.171127188338741
These values and examples of dose plans were used to emphasize the advantages of the treatment principle with multiple isocenters.	1.1001433463439256
An analysis of data in the literature revealed that there is no uniform standard of treatment available in radiosurgery.	1.2733292757179586
A highly significant correlation between a risk prediction model for the stereotactic linear accelerator on the one hand and a different model for the LGK on the other could be shown.	1.1287890145017534
This result could be helpful in order to proceed towards a more uniform treatment standard in radiosurgery and to improve overall treatment results.	0.9817373742868822
Even if Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis has not found the true aetiology of puerperal fever - bacteria were identified as pathogens only after his observations - he was the first to consequently use epidemiological methods in order to elucidate connections and influencing factors in the spread of nosocomial infections, to draw the right conclusions from his observations on the transmission of childbed fever and to draw the right consequences by implementing preventive measures, especially the hand disinfection.	1.1003084919778499
He has correctly realized that human beings suffering from purulent or putride lesions or having even died from them can act as infectious sources as can hands of health-care personnel act as vehicles.	0.855296268001082
As a characteristic feature of nosocomial infection, he noticed that generally only the weakend organism of the patient is involved as an infection target.	1.1977600723518396
The impact of his doctrine not only made him "saviour of the mothers" but also justifies to regard him as "father of the obstetric infection prevention" if not even as the founder of the modern science-based hospital hygiene.	1.0459087869664574
In this paper we present a method for measuring the wear of the polyethylene inlay in knee joint endoprostheses from standard X-ray images.	1.1740771414792077
Our approach is to estimate the spatial position of the tibial and femoral components of the prostheses from their contours in the X-ray image.	1.084251634974073
When we know the exact shape of these two components, we can calculate the minimal spatial distance between them which approximates the remaining thickness of the inlay.	1.1243499996528912
First results show that this approach might provide sufficient accuracy for the given task.	0.9972517359389974
Most children with borreliosis show cutaneous symptoms following a tick bite infected with Borrelia Burgdorferi.	0.7487456076448614
Erythema migrans is a classical skin lesion of early borreliosis characterized by a centrifugally expanding erythema at the site of the prior tick bite.	0.9055999018506904
After hematological spreading of the vector multiple erythemata migrantia occur with a very low incidence in Europe as described in the case of a 2 1/2 years old infant who was successfully treated with oral cephalosporine.	1.0728726718524026
One year follow-up revealed no further manifestations of borreliosis.	0.9018773672046813
This means an excellent prognosis for those children with borreliosis who are treated promptly.	0.9432023426478501
Background: We compared the standard suprathreshhold strategy to the so-called threshhold splitting strategy with 5 and 2 dB steps.	1.094359492957764
The aim of the study was to establish whether the threshhold splitting strategy had advantages over the suprathreshhold strategy that has been used to date.	1.0213947102576553
Resection specimens of 14 patients with small cell bronchial carcinoma after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were processed histologically and graded according to a three-step regression grading system: grade I, no or only slight tumor regression; grade II, incomplete tumor regression; grade III, complete tumor regression without vital tumor tissue.	1.071840648376299
In five patients with either no vital tumor tissue or only small tumor remnants in the resection samples, a typical sequence of central fresh tumor necrosis, foam cell rim, vascular granulation tissue and peripheral scar formation was seen.	1.082510651487024
This morphological finding may be interpreted as a characteristic, but unspecific parameter of good response to preoperative chemotherapy.	0.9580867239827435
The presence of vital tumor rims surrounding the capillary bed with intermingled necrotic foci, however, argues in favor of spontaneous tumor regression, which is commonly observed in small cell lung cancer.	1.1503821172571762
Background: The term "Castleman's diseas" (angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia) comprises a heterogeneous clinicopathologic entity among lymphoproliferative disorders.	0.9919549185908291
In accordance with the German law on care for helpless persons, an observer rating scale has been developed to allow a staging of need of care.	1.1329042783438312
Construction of the scale, item descriptions, definitions, algorithms for sum score and inter-rater reliability data are reported.	0.8227475872416437
The scale can reliably measure the need of care, quality of care, and who is the care provider.	1.066940617830673
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) improves the success of trabeculectomy.	0.8391727794952378
Since in vitro studies showed a prolonged effect of 36 days of growth inhibition with a single dose of 5-FU, 5-FU is applied intraoperatively.	1.2229209997324688
To evaluate the effect of intraoperatively applied 5-FU, we compared 13 (low-risk) patients with intraoperative application of 5-FU to a control group matched by age, diagnosis, sex and stage of glaucoma.	1.2801206710687707
Postoperatively on day 4 the IOP was significant lower (4.8 mmHg) in the 5-FU-group in comparison to the untreated group (P=0.005; power 0.80).	1.2696704844296258
After 1 week the difference decreased to 2 mmHg and was not significant any more (P=0.16).	1.1260671363168997
After 1 week a lower mean intraocular pressure of 2 mmHg was found with a P-value of 0.16.	1.0301796726456658
It may be that these results are not just due to an antiproliferative mechanism; a direct toxic effect of 5-FU should be considered.	1.1831574694740092
5-FU side effects such as corneal complications and inflammatory reaction were not increased in the 5-FU group.	1.0050743888644502
However, one case of persistent hypotony was seen in the 5-FU group.	1.4271097823678345
This study found intraoperative use of 5-FU to be a safe procedure with a pronounced capacity to lower IOP in the direct postoperative phase.	1.1770983778278439
However, this effect may not be based on an antiproliferative effect alone, but might be of toxic origin.	1.3849764765064463
A postoperative bile fistula is a rare but severe complication after biliary surgery.	0.906825773113809
Clinical signs, laboratory findings, ultrasound and ERC lead to diagnosis.	0.8553355866892488
We report on 40 cases with postoperative bile leakage after cholecystectomy treated by a nasobiliary tube.	1.174995689158498
In all patients the fistula healed within 7 days after placement of the tube.	0.9906793945056268
Two patients needed operative treatment of a subhepatic abscess, and in 2 patients drainage of a bilioma was performed.	1.2785903955126476
In 2 cases with biliary peritonitis, a step-by-step lavage was necessary.	1.0059577443305912
The nasobiliary tube for postoperative bile fistula offers regular radiological control and reduces the necessity of operative reintervention in the biliary tract.	0.908642894814039
Description of a 27 years old patient with chronic renal failure due to diabetes, which requires dialysis, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism, who developed fulminant systemic calciphylaxis after successful renal transplantation.	1.2065091175939244
Characteristic of this syndrome, there occured soft tissue calcification, mediacalcinosis of the small and medium-sized arteries and ischemic skin necrosis.	1.1478036861743763
The pathogenesis is not completely clear, but challenging agents like corticosteroids or immunsuppressants, in a sensitized organism (at hypercalcemia or elevated parathormon) could lead to calcium deposits.	1.2261090271264075
These are showing a particular affinity for elastic tissue.	0.7026353659340792
Lungs, stomach, kidneys, cutis, heart and vascular system are most frequently involved.	0.9892755467836193
Treatment is primarily supportive; an early parathyroidectomy seems to have the best prognosis.	1.033054365841247
Contact urticaria and anaphylactic reactions to latex-containing rubber products are being recognized with increasing frequency in all kinds of medical disciplines.	0.9270499952797717
Recently a number of reports have been published describing anaphylactic reactions to food items in patients with latex allergy.	1.0486706106180017
The cases of three patients who developed anaphylactic reactions to both latex and food items are presented, and the importance of the association of latex and cross-reactivity with food items is stressed.	1.188495314875641
The food items that led to anaphylactic reactions were banana and avocado; banana, avocado and buckwheat; and banana, avocado and tomato.	0.794977558303149
The cross-reactivity of latex to buckwheat and tomato has not been reported before.	0.8786507811564734
The branchio-oto-renal syndrome (BOR syndrome) is characterized by auricular abnormalities, lateral cervical fistulas and preauricular tags.	0.8875647676823704
The hearing impairment may be a conductive, a sensorineural or a mixed hearing loss.	1.0570428204999955
The renal disease is oligomeganephronia, a bilateral, congenital renal abnormality with reduced numbers of nephrons.	1.0144731785327596
The BOR syndrome is an autosomal-dominant disease.	0.922268536251883
Corneal metabolism is reduced after cataract extraction.	0.7310568736826942
The available literature on the psychosocial aspects of head and neck cancer surgery from 1950 to 1995 was reviewed in four parts.	0.553546903206707
The CO2 laser myringotomy is a current low-pain procedure for middle-ear ventilation for secretory otitis media (SOM) that can be performed under topical anesthesia, even in children.	1.0554374076694422
The duration of middle-ear ventilation is essentially determined by the size of the perforation created.	1.0147391363395422
Perforations with a diameter greater than 2 mm ventilate the tympanic cavity for approximately 3 weeks, thus avoiding tympanic ventilation tubes.	0.9637394821948638
To date, the CO2 laser beam can only be reliably applied to the tympanic membrane via a micromanipulator system coupled to an ear microscope.	0.9544222818907917
The CO2 laser otoscope is a new application system that markedly reduces the technical complexity of surgery and improves the mobility and availability of the system.	1.0790333216574093
The incorporation of a small inexpen-sive CO2 laser in the otoscope represents a significant development in SOM therapy.	0.8873034683096516
Abstract   Amifostine is an organic thiophsophate which protecvts normal cells from the effects of chemotherapy with reduced nadir and duration of cyclophosphmamid induced neutropenia, reduced cisplatin derived renal and neurological complications being described.	0.9753712223360766
However, no data are available for urological malignancies treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy.	1.1490255438633046
Aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of pretreatment with amifostine in terms of prevention of renal, hematopoetic and neurologic toxicity.	0.8983532502050741
17 patients (mean age: 62.6 [45-74]) with advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder received inductive or adjuvant cisplatin based chemotherapy (1-6 cycles) with a cisplatin dose of 70 mg/m2.	1.2657688200197443
Amifostine (740-910 mg/m2) was administered intravenously 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy.	0.9478503242012717
For all patients creatinine clearance, serum creatinine and electrolytes including magnesium, and blood cell count were determined prior to and after each cycle.	1.1304058322824384
A group of 12 patients (mean age: 61.9 [51-67]) did undergo MVEC chemotherapy (1-4 cycles) without receiving amifostine and served as control group.	1.2602719557501336
Amifostine was well tolerated and only 1 patient suffered from gastrointestinal discomfort, blood pressure remained unchanged in all patients.	1.0745673067640398
Amifostine prevented a significant reduction of creatinine clearance even in the 2 patients with known renal insufficiency: mean creatinine clearance was 125  +/-  20 ml/min prior to and 115  +/-  25 ml/min after chemotherapy.	1.148286228648082
In the control group, however, creatinine clearance dropped from 121  +/-  30 ml/min to 85  +/-  20 ml/min after completion of MVEC chemotherapy.	1.0647464964930466
Serum creatinine levels did not increase significantly (1.1 mg/dl prior to and 1.2 mg/dl after chemotherapy), magnesium levels did not decrease significantly and normalized at the end of chemotherapy.	1.3409051740779425
Significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia developed in 29 % and 12 % of the patients in the amifostine group and in 67 % and 33 % of the patients in the control group.	1.3302595409974975
Amifostine was shown to have a protective effect against cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity in the elderly patient undergoing systemic chemotherapy.	1.0900744025888454
Based on our data amifostine should be applied in the supportive management to prevent chemotherapy induced complications.	0.9995797508300976
The diagnosis of leptomeningeal dissemination of chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL) by conventional cytology is unreliable because cytomorphologic criteria of malignancy are often lacking.	1.0214260058517273
Immunophenotyping of leukocyte differentiation antigens may also be of limited diagnostic value due to the small  number of cells in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples.	0.9387056156556687
Molecular methods may support the specific diagnosis of leptomeningeal infiltration of CLL.	0.9082406338583404
We present an 54 old patient who was diagnosed with CLL five years ago.	1.046558235062777
Despite clinical signs of leptomeningeal  involvement neither magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) nor conventional CSF analysis were suggestive of lymphomatous meningitis.	0.8352764718629317
Using PCR we selectively amplified the highly variable and clone-specific CDR3 region of the locus encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) in DNA obtained from both CSF and peripheral blood cells.	0.9654484963096253
Analysis of PCR products by high resolution gel electrophoresis revealed a single DNA fragment respectively indicating the presence of a  monoclonal cell population in both  compartments.	1.0029155094546645
DNA sequence analysis of the amplified CDR3 segments confirmed the clonal identity of cells and the leptomeningeal dissemination of CLL.	0.8615956639194422
In the orthopedic department of the University Hospital Homburg/Saar, we use since 1993 a computer-based system for clinics organisation and documentation of operations.	1.097721813972219
Hardware consists of DOS/Windows PC's in a Novell-network.	0.6920261999634183
Our software is a combination of datbase-system for managing patient-data and a special coding program for ICD and IKPM-digits.	0.9111913492706272
Our experience shows that computer assisted clinic-management is an effective tool to help the surgeon in planning and documentation.	0.9604321649188546
Until now, we used the system for 31 500 patients and 8500 operations.	1.1086129405801066
A flexible software can meet the requirements both of the surgeons and administration.	0.8579432237259572
Moreover, in the University hospital Homburg/Saar, the different departments are linked by an Intranet with connection to other scientific networks and the Internet.	1.1620480829564845
In one third of the little girls coming to the outpatient clinic for pediatric gynecology, a vulvovaginitis can be diagnosed.	1.0536042581741278
Etiologic factors are poor perineal hygiene, foreign bodies in the vagina and respiratory or skin infections.	0.9751257451092951
The microbiologic investigation often reveals staphylococci, streptococci, E. coli, and in case of chronical-recurrent discharge also B. fragilis and peptostreptococci.	1.1402168030007893
The symptoms are itching, burning, dysuria, discharge and rubor of the vulva.	0.9339490210123641
A systemic application of antibiotics is not necessary, a local treatment with antibiotic solutions is contraindicated and the usual vaginal suppositories are unsuitable for girls.	1.0666848075333797
A desinfection often irritates the vulvovaginal region of little girls so that for years we use estriol ointment only which is tolerated.	0.8282202060045323
Excellently, a single-dose application being sufficient; burning, itching and discharge disappear and the vaginal epithelium gets more resistant because of the estrogen influence, so that the healing process is accelerated.	1.046374416742402
The author gives a short overview of the psychodynamic and psychoanalytic basics of psychotherapy with guided affective imagery.	0.8983710174756768
The differences of the imaginations of neurotic patients and patients with severe personality disorders are demonstrated and discussed.	1.0430983680386265
Two clinical cases are described in detail which show the special elements of symbol formation on different levels of ego-structure.	0.9364968926838412
Then the most important results of the recent infant research and the research of attachment behaviour, especially those of the group of Fonagy, and their importance for the theory of symbol formation are discussed.	1.287751092615591
The theory of potential space is used as a base for understanding imaginative processes.	0.8753811802130927
General and special technical recommandations for the treatment of borderline cases with guided affective imagery are derived.	0.9040661927941479
Especially the relationship to the theories of Bion, Ogden and Winnicott is estimated.	0.7577668032137259
The situation of psychiatric patients in the Ukraine is determined by the financial and economic difficulties of this country.	1.0150315890782284
In the larger cities, so-called polyclinics take care of ambulant psychiatric patients.	0.8762459716160578
However, no other social psychiatric institutions exist.	1.2539299507194552
Here, the modalities of hospital psychiatric treatment are discussed using the psychiatric hospitals in Kiev and Shitomir as examples.	0.9767207229371951
Undertreatment is also a problem, because only a few psychopharmacological drugs are produced in the Ukraine.	1.151249914955235
Import of new psychopharmacological agents is hampered by economical problems.	0.7147794222126556
Improving the availability of psychopharmacological drugs and the establishment of a social psychiatric network are major aims for psychiatrists working in Ukraine.	0.7874775556055617
Renal lesions are frequently encountered in blunt pediatric abdominal trauma.	0.6742109933393102
In this retrospective study, we analyzed the incidence of renal trauma in these trauma patients to determine which diagnostic and therapeutic approaches were most predictive.	1.162114332229652
From 1976 to 1996, 308 children sustaining blunt abdominal trauma were admitted to our department.	0.7705678325024203
Patients were evaluated using abdominal paracentesis, ultrasonography, and urinary analysis.	1.0268799683825607
In specific cases, IV urography, CT scan, and/or angiography were applied.	1.0901719595027386
We used the Organ Injury Scale (OIS) for classification of renal trauma into five grades.	0.9713157175703018
The result of a B-scan ultrasound examination is strongly dependent on the type of the used B-system, the chosen system parameters and the experience and critical analysis of the clinical investigator.	1.0776988707537243
The estimation of quantitative acoustic parameters, independent of the type of the used B-system, is one way to overcome the subjective nature and the problems of the interpretation of B-scan images.	1.0803157443481832
Results of a longitudinal study about the transition to retirement are presented.	0.9537956421223602
329 persons were interviewed three times (quantitative study) and 20 persons conducted a semi-structured diary (qualitative study), covering in both groups a two-year period (from half a year before retirement to one and a half years after retirement).	1.1080251944420045
They were asked about their subjective well-being (happiness, joy, satisfaction, stresses), their life situation and their personal, social and material resources.	1.0841390171801895
The results show that the transition to retirement brings with it gains (leisure time) and losses (financial, social status), but overall maintains a high level of well-being.	1.1252365322420372
Specific analyses point out inter-individual differences, risk factors and resources, like a high level of trait well-being, health, social networks and an optimistic outlook.	1.0176328313392597
The diary analyses lead to specifications, more detailed process analyses and hypotheses about cohort effects.	0.9156632148057072
Consequences for an adequate preparation for retirement are discussed.	0.746245205600724
Intraoperative complications can be divided into three categories on the basis of the time of their occurrence: Group I - Problems associated with access; group II: introduction of the endovascular stent (a: release of the main segment, b: anchoring the second limb); and group III: incidence of primary endoleaks.	1.232722496847395
Interferon alpha and gamma have been used to treat several hepatic, hematological and oncological diseases for years.	0.9889306355817651
Recently, interferon beta has been introduced as a therapeutic agent in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.	1.1260837651475561
A 41-year-old female patient with multiple sclerosis developed non-tender, palm-sized, cutaneous-subcutaneous, reddish infiltrates at the injection sites on her thighs after 8 weeks of treatment with subcutaneous interferon beta injections.	0.9937139568251818
Histopathology revealed a perivascular lymphoid infiltrate of the dermis and a subtle lobular lymphoid infiltrate of the subcutis.	0.9294861378842983
Interferon beta therapy was discontinued for 4 weeks.	0.7295538601873314
With topical corticosteroids, the skin lesions resolved.	1.1441848417868505
When subcutaneous injections were resumed at a reduced dose, only erythema around injection sites developed without induration or pain.	0.916383925418288
Slight erythema and swelling at interferon beta injection site are frequent and rare cases of cutaneous necrosis have been described.	0.9279825663624826
However, no reports of large, painful, cutaneous-subcutaneous infiltrates after interferon beta therapy have been published.	1.0437203205003853
In adults, infectious spondylitis is a rare but severe disease, caused by a bacterial thrombus in tissue of reduced resistance.	1.073239407366636
In conventional radiographs initial findings are a narrowing of the intervertebral space, local osteoporosis and poorly defined erosive borders of the vertebral endplates.	1.0760934175684786
These changings can be found at least three to six weeks after the onset of disease.	1.0961501495908512
However, in Szintigraphy and MRT pathologic alterations are evident after ten to twelve days.	1.0489523067395474
Thus, early diagnosis and treatment becomes possible.	1.4808123059998743
In early stages of the disease a localized lysis surrounded by a reactive sclerosis appears in predisposed areas of the vertebral body (subchondral, anterobasal, ventral, central).	1.020022182228346
Apparently, a soft tissue tumor is associated.	1.0441919412811622
Sclerosis and reduction of the soft tissue tumor are the first signs of repair processes.	0.9199854078694266
After at least 12 weeks, computed tomography can reveal typical sintering of the vertebral body and occasionally the development of a bony sequester.	1.0955757037894656
In addition, MRT as well as CT can be helpful in the detection and localization of complications as abscesses or affection of the vertebral canal.	1.219817367034905
The tuberculous spondylitis can sometimes cause difficulties in differential diagnosis.	0.5433494087341605
Clinical findings, affection of several vertebral bodies, large soft tissue tumors with appearance of calcification as well as not typical locations are strongly suggestive of tuberculous spondylitis, but these findings are not specific of the disease.	1.0752555433588022
Degenerative disorders such as erosive osteochondrosis or changings due to chronic dialysis (e. g. amyloid or crystal arthropathies) may cause even more problems in differential diagnosis.	0.9592918927554931
Typical for a blastomatous process is the integrity of the interverebral disc space, which is a rare finding in spondylitis.	1.2119415212119669
To show the possibilities of imaging diagnostic procedures using high and extremely high resolution ultrasonic probes we investigated the anatomic structures of the foot.	1.008080487648241
We examinated 10 cadaver foots of the anatomic institute and in a clinical trial 20 healthy patients with 10 to 20-MHz-probes and could identify correctly single tendons and ligaments even in the toe region.	1.027586292349337
Especially the possibility of dynamic examination had to be mentioned beside the other advantages of ultrasound diagnostic (saving of expenses, lack of radiation, side-to-side comparison).	1.0323499822907174
An essential parameter for the incorporation of drugs and narcotics into head hair is the content of hair pigment (melanins).	0.8846963207917012
Toxicological studies of hair should therefore take the colour of the hair into consideration.	1.0330322267506455
As the available vocabulary for verbal characterisation is small and the description depends on the subjective opinion of the viewer, it was the purpose of this study to investigate if colorimetric measurements allow objectivation of hair colour.	1.1302497465500836
The natural hair colour of 17 subjects was described subjectively in words and by comparing it with a hair colour chart (Wella, Darmstadt, Germany).	0.9183287174212122
Subsequently the colours of the hair and the samples of the hair colour chart used for comparison were measured by colorimetric analysis and the CIEL*a*b* values were determined.	1.0650736823862503
The descriptive categorisation of the hair colours (e.g.	0.6951900171021074
blonde, brown, black) could often not be recognised in the colorimetric results.	1.0657214525902488
Sometimes considerable differences were also found between the colour values of the natural hair samples and the specimens used for comparison.	1.1768485483908422
When the colour measurements were repeated at intervals of several days the results were found to be reproducible.	1.157188309083168
We measured the ventilatory pattern and additional work of breathing (WOBadd) at three different levels of inspiratory pressure support [IPS 5, 10, 15 mbar above positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)] and in a new ventilatory mode, automatic tube compensation (ATC), in nine operative patients without lung injury nine patients ventilated for several following acute respiratory insufficiency (ARI).	1.142121764064464
In ATC, endotracheal tube resistance is compensated automatically by means of closed-loop control of the calculated tracheal pressure.	0.9632253368281553
Pressure support in this mode, i. e. airway pressure above PEEP, is equal to the actual flow-dependent pressure drop across the endotracheal tube (ETT).	1.0493694767906854
Airway pressure rises at the beginning of inspiration and falls towards the end.	0.8030986748278404
As the tube resistance of ETT seriously hinders expiration and can cause desynchronization between ventilator and patient, airway pressure is reduced below PEEP during expiration in the same way as it is increased during inspiration.	0.9785174782986155
The result is a near-constant tracheal pressure at PEEP both during inspiration and during expiration.	0.9081387388642145
This mode could be best termed as "electronic extubation".	0.7380320278601831
The most striking difference between the postoperative patients and the ARI patients was their minute ventilation (17.8+/-1.85 l/min in ARI patients vs 7.3+/-3.1 l/min in the postoperative patients).	1.3389214367339937
In the postoperative patients augmentation of IPS from 5 to 15 mbar induced a steady increase in tidal volume (VT) and a consecutive decrease in respiratory rate (rr) compared with ATC (VTATC,postop= 463+/-78 ml; rrATC,postop =16+/-4 min-1; VTIPS5,postop = 505+/-79 ml; rrIPS5,postop = 15+/-4 min-1; VTIPS10,postop = 562+/-86 ml; rrIPS15,postop =14+/-4 min-1; VTIPS15,postop=660+/- 151 ml; rrTPS15, postop = 12+/-4 min-1), whereas the augmentation of IPS of 5 and 10 mbar in the ARI patients could not compensate for the increase in rr and the decrease in VT, after switching from ATC to IPS (VTATC,ARI 724+/-308 ml, rrATC,ARI = 24+/-6 min-1; VTIPS5,ARI = 649+/-315 ml; rrIPS 5,ARI = 27+/-8 min-1; VTIPS10,ARI=653+/-353 ml; rrIPS10,ARI = 25+/-8 min-1: Even IPS 15 was not able to reestablish VT at the values observed during ATC (VTIPS15,ARI =680+/-312 ml).	1.1210106974339575
During ATC WOBadd was small in both postoperative and ARI patients (WOBadd,ATC,postop = 93+/-36 mJ/l, WOBadd,ATC,ARI =116 +/-72 mJ/l).	1.1037494295455044
In the postoperative patients, an inspiratory pressure support of 5 mbar was not sufficient to compensate WOBadd compared with ATC.	1.0949486174308631
However, IPS 10 and 15 mbar were able to compensate for WOBadd (WOBadd.ATC5,postop WOBadd,IPS5,postop =189+/-77 mJ/l; WOBadd,IPS10,postop = 55+/-30 mJ/l; WOBadd,IPS15,postop = 21+/-11 mJ/l).	1.1090100163648728
In the ARI patients an IPS 5, 10 or 15 mbar was not sufficient to compensate for WOBadd (WOBadd,IPS 5,ARI = 1126+/-262 mJ/l; WOBadd,IPS 10,ARI 863+/-253 mJ/l; WOBadd,IPS 15,ARI 763+/-298 mJ/l).	1.019090110212753
Under ATC, WOBadd was only 15% of WOBadd under IPS of 15 mbar.	1.1253232077892328
All but two patients were successfully extubated after the investigation.	1.0218918869782347
These two patients were not extubated because they were dependent on an FIO2 >0.5.	1.1324591993084798
Our results strongly indicate that ventilatory dependence in ARI patients may be caused by the ETT rather than by mechanical dysfunction of the lung.	0.9145462120429722
ATC is a very helpful mode to use in distinguishing between ventilatory failure caused by ETT and real ventilatory dependence.	1.0224674957392812
The preoperative localization of pharmaco-resistent focal epilepsies before surgery and the prognosis concerning seizure outcome are both of importance.	0.9775373296793095
In addition to conventional MRI diagnostics for the detection of small epileptogenic lesions, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (HMR spectroscopy) can be useful for assessing the bilaterality of pathological changes in cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsies.	1.0442241862139607
The technique and findings of HMR spectroscopy are reported in patients with cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsies.	0.8001909193442764
The findings indicate that chemical shift imaging (CSI) investigations of the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres provide important information for the prediction of seizure outcome after epilepsy surgery.	0.937253294218699
This paper describes the conceptual considerations in planning and realizing an inpatient unit for traumatized patients.	0.7127180261023045
The different concepts of the dynamic of the traumatic disease and the aetiopathology of posttraumatic stressdisease (PTSD) are highly significant in regard to the realisation of differing concepts of inpatient therapy of trauma.	1.1123042780158958
The utilisation of Konzentrative Bewegungstherapy (KBT) and Creative Therapy in our conflict- and solution-oriented analytic concept permits us to neglect a fictitious contradiction between traumaexposure and traumalimitation and a "potential space" (Winnicott) can be opened to the creative work with the patients.	1.0208144844624392
This paper illustrates with some casuistic examples the utilisation of KBT in transforming the traumatic body-flashbacks into narrative memory-scripts, by the use of symbolizing processes.	0.9094344419061522
In 55 consecutive patients with the same dual chamber pacemaker (Relay, Intermedics) and different pacing leads, the influence of different safety margins for pacing on battery current was investigated.	1.1259575937533157
2.8 +/- 0.9 years after implantation, atrial and ventricular pulse-width thresholds (tRS) (ms) were determined at 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 V, and the charge delivered at threshold was telemetered.	1.300426969463458
If tRS was <1.50 ms at 0.5 V, an amplitude of 1.0 V was programmed in the atrium and the ventricule; if tRS was <1.50 ms at 1.0 V, then an amplitude of 2.0 V was chosen.	1.0416414773197287
Two times the charge threshold (2x QRS), two times the voltage threshold (2x URS), and three times the pulse-width threshold (3x tRS) were programmed as the safety margins for pacing.	1.2195633703879425
With every safety margin, battery current (IRS) (¬µA) was averaged from 5 telemetric readings in D00 mode with 70 bpm.	0.9959247554186776
IBat was significantly lower with 2x QRS as compared with 2x URS (13.43 +/- 1.0 vs. 14.20 +/- 1.2 ¬µA, p<0.01) and as compared with 3x tRS (13.99 +/- 1.2 ¬µA, p<0.05).	0.9549437697634726
Pacemaker longevity derived from these current data was significantly longer with 2x QRS (112 +/- 8 months) as compared with 2x URS (106 +/- 9, p<0.01) and as compared with 3x tRS (108 +/- 8, p<0.05).	1.0197739855115437
If current consumption is compared intraindividually in dependance on the programmed amplitude, battery current is significantly lower at 1.0 V as compared with 2.0 V resulting in a mean reduction of 0.63 ¬µA (-4.9%, p<0.05) and an average gain in longevity of 5 months.	1.2568946623076829
This applies to every safety margin tested.	0.6108739947831213
Differences in battery current caused by the safety margins will translate into a greater gain in longevity in future pacemaker models with reduced internal current consumption.	0.8908218762273087
Any medical procedure must be legally authorized by the patient, giving informed consent.	0.9163634711673403
This prerequisite is based on the right to self determination.	1.1147175693306084
Otherwise a medical procedure is considered as physical injury.	0.9982761714490713
Thus, the way, how a specific procedure is performed, predominantly depends on the patient's will.	1.28387055391903
The attending physician's duty is to find out this will, which is especially important when old patients and patients incapable of giving valid consent are involved.	1.1630143550381828
Before the procedure the physician has to have a confidential talk with the patient.	1.0441382121661376
He has to point out the best treatment possible considering the individual circumstances of the patient's life.	1.0528950114061955
The physician has to find out, weather the patient is competent to refuse or consent to treatement.	1.029153646842603
Furthermore the consultation is an opportunity to diminish the patient's fear and to increase his confidence.	0.9778102558111361
The main problem treating old patients is that they often lack the mental ability for appreciation of the nature of the situation.	1.0571585017693894
One has to differentiate between the physiological mental decay and dementia or psychiatric diseases.	0.8746494904916787
In these cases a third party consent is necessary.	0.9126648048407825
This review of German neurology during the Nazi era mentions first the significance of Jewish neurologists for the history of the specialty, and the irreplaceable loss that their expulsion from Germany represented.	1.0790728302656487
A brief discussion of the scientific accomplishments of German neurologists during this time is followed by a description of violations of ethical principles, exemplified by the human experiments of G. Schaltenbrand.	1.0669510344522342
The spirit of the age exerted a malevelent influence.	0.7567410269177043
A postal survey targeted at 1000 firms in the metal- and electronic working industry of Northrhine Westfalia was carried out by Sozialforschungsstelle Dortmund und Institute of geronotology to analyze the implementation of the collective agreement concerning partial retirement.	0.9036574095044092
As the results show, firms in Northrhine Westfalia are willing to accept the collective agreement and use partial retirement though there are still problems left to solve.	1.0023193300600144
Firms are further using partial retirement as an instrument of early retirement.	0.9169203590774655
Therefore partial retirement is created as a so-called "blocked model".	0.6957434160552054
From February 1991 to May 1998, 340 patients had a cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) implanted.	0.9217234699542591
Mean age was 64  +/-  9 years, 278 male and 62 female.	1.0059914441062747
60% of patients had coronary artery disease and 31% dilative cardiomyopathy.	1.2155135362181082
Ejection fraction was 38  +/-  14%.	0.7293009739930034
The indication for an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator was in 57% of patients ventricular tachycardia, in 43% ventricular fibrillation.	1.243962999954249
298 patients had a single-chamber cardioverter/defibrillator implanted, 42 patients a dual-chamber cardioverter/defibrillator.	0.8578767504033558
In 25 patients additional subcutaneous patch or array electrodes and in 2 patients additional epicardial patch electrodes were implanted.	0.9196381880694293
Implantation site was in 92 patients abdominal and in 248 pectoral.	0.8374427489495654
Over a period of 7 years 34 lead-related complications occured in 33 patients (9.7%), after a median of 2 months after implantation.	1.300789492252483
Diagnosis was made by routine chest x-ray in about 55% of lead-related complications, by clinical presentation (inadequate therapy, pain) in 24%, and by electrical parameters in 21%.	1.31879419156382
In patients with an abdominal implantation site, lead-related complications occurred in 20%, in contrast to 6% in patients with a pectoral implantation site.	1.4193409387045135
Regarding patients with pectoral implantation site, lead-related complications were observed in 12% of patients with a dual-chamber ICD vs 4% with a single-chamber ICD (p = 0.05), due to dislocation of atrial electrodes with dual-chamber ICD.	1.214972734762078
There were no differences in clinical parameters between patients with pectoral vs abdominal and between single vs dual-chamber ICD.	0.9414620682809844
Several new approaches are available for early defibrillation.	0.9166237488194044
One example is semiautomatic defibrillators used by the first arriving emergency staff.	0.885924933643129
The recommendations for introducing emergency medical technician (EMT) defibrillation in Germany are based either on the results in cities with so called doctor-manned-ambulances or the experiences of the German multi-center-study.	1.0822457698665626
This analysis intends to contribute data to an EMT defibrillation program in cities with a so called rendezvous-system.	0.8310927094213408
Methods: In a prospective study a EMT-defibrillation group (= DG) was compared with a standard group (basic life support by EMTs and defibrillation by emergency physicians) (= SG) and a control group (emergency physicians starting resuscitation alone or together with EMTs) (= CG).	1.265357498045235
In the DG semiautomatic defibrillators from Laerdal (Heartstart 3000) were used.	0.925566193479926
Successfully resuscitated patients were followed up with the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), the Pittsburgh Brain Stem Score (PBSS), and Pittsburgh Cerebral (CPC) and Overall Performance Categorie (OPC).	1.0419128303493759
Results: Over 13 months 43 patients were included, primarily presenting with ventricular fibrillation (VF).	1.057089912264063
Depending on the first arriving emergency staff the patients were allocated to the DG (n = 12), to the SG (n = 18) or to the CG (n = 13).	1.2986121083755735
DG and SG did not differ significantly concerning the primary survival rate or the long-term prognosis (primary successful 8.3% vs. 38.9%, definite successful 0% vs. 27.8%).	1.0981603118584098
The primary survival rate in the DG was significantly lower than in the CG (8.3% vs. 61.5%).	0.9355959320453253
In the long term survival rate there were no significant differences.	0.9913190722884515
In the DG significantly less patients received bystander CPR (8.3%) than in the other groups (55.6% and 69.2%).	1.1344425571123686
Neither the variable "witnessed collapes" nor "bystander CPR" had a significant influence for the outcome of the patients in this study.	1.1756090169672972
The average response time for the first arriving rescue team was 5.5 +/- 2.4 min, without a significant difference between the groups.	1.2840240709775996
Conclusions: A comparison of this study with American, European and German recommendations for EMT defibrillation programms revealed some deviations.	1.307400643886678
Bystander CPR seems to be of special importance as well as the time interval between defibrillation and the arrival of the emergency physician.	1.1953990648388861
A benefit of EMT defibrillation could not be demonstrated in our "rendezvous-system", possibly because the time interval was less than 4 min (3.5 min).	1.3309341116694284
Since the result is in accordance with the German multi-center-study, a critical consideration of a EMT defibrillation program seems to be necessary in "Rendezvous-systems".	1.1481584393055724
Ninety-two strains of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE) from 80 patients of 31 hospitals in 11 federal states were analyzed.	0.9834076521128552
They were primarily isolated in intensive care units (general, surgical, internistic, pediatric, oncological ones), but also in nephrologic/dialysis or neurologic/orthopaedic wards.	1.1499175332019989
A dominance of VanA type E. faecium strains was observed (n=81; 88.0%).	0.9190966260197504
In addition, strains of E. faecalis (VanA; n=4; 4.4%), E. faecium (VanB; n=1; 1.1%), and E. gallinarum (VanC1, n=6; 6.5%) were found.	1.2550642688570905
The 81 VanA strains of E. faecium possessed the following resistances to other antibiotics: erythromycin, ciprofloxacin (both 93.8%), ampicillin, oxytetracycline (both 88.9%), rifampicin (79.0%), trimethoprim/sulfameracin (61.7%), chloramphenicol (18.9%), fusidic acid (12.3%), quinupristin/dalfopristin (7.4%); gentamicin (46.9%) and streptomycin (37.0%), also together with ampicillin resistance (9.9-35.8%).	1.1816242178866325
In some of these VanA type strains resistance to teicoplanin cannot be completely expressed in-vitro.	0.9015354194390256
Macrorestriction analysis of E. faecium outbreak isolates (VanA type) from hospitals in different federal states indicated an intra- and interhospital spread of a defined strain.	1.131233955070153
However, heterogeneous plasmid and plasmid restriction patterns showed that these strains were not completely identical.	1.092153235410147
The scapulothoracic dissociation (SD) is a complex injury of the shoulder girdle, mostly associated with polytraumatized critically ill patients.	1.1158254852781153
This case report of 3 patients shows the variety of possible injuries combined with SD.	1.1300654824904954
Diagnosis and therapy in such a rare trauma, which is most likely seen in specialized trauma centres are being described.	1.2570291517695773
The 3 patients are presented from trauma to management, with remarks to various possibilities in treatment.	1.121993430897429
Reports of other groups include multicenter studies with small numbers of patients, making it different to look for homogenity or defining standards, whereas current guidelines are being mentioned, including remarks on the management of these mostly polytraumatized and vitally endangered patients.	1.0304996948354983
This is a case report on arthroscopic removal of a glass splinter from the knee joint of a 56-year-old male.	1.091024476071679
Recurrent hemarthrosis of the knee was the reason for differential diagnosis, as the patient could not remember any trauma.	1.3557693600099272
After performing MRI, a 12 x 5 mm signal-free zone showed up in the area of the lateral condylus femoris, which was identified through arthroscopy as a glass splinter and removed.	1.1543074941338625
The patient was discharged soon after without any complaints.	0.9886140989510597
Many patients with acquired strabismus do not suffer from diplopia and confusion after an individually and age-dependent interval.	0.9051834770477934
They inhibit the image of the deviated eye by binocular rilvary and particularly by the physiological ability to disregard visually disturbing stimuli.	0.8554508149489671
Red cells, platelet concentrates and fresh frozen plasma of a single donation contain leucocytes, causing a lot of side effects.	0.9625769919074841
Modern filtration- and apheresis-techniques lead to a reduction of residual leucocyte counts of <1x106 per unit.	1.0626375063059996
The best method to achieve controlled and validated conditions is the blood bank performed standardised prestorage-filtration.	0.8819785777469644
This is an effective method, to prevent cytokine-mediated and leucocyte-mediated febrile nonhaemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTR), to prevent a primary immunisation to leucocyte- and histocompatibility-antigens, to avoid transmission of viral infections by blood transfusion, e.g.	1.1643304180992367
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and to exclude in special cases bacterial septicaemia.	1.094824552533415
In addition, there are references to reduce the postoperative infections, the rate of recurrence of a tumor and the postoperative complications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.	1.4222981238785497
The use of leucocyte-depleted blood components for special indications is meanwhile established.	0.8079821116629395
Some European countries have made a decision for a general filtration of all blood components containing leucocytes.	0.9547748793272732
The authors recommend the general leucocyte-depletion of blood components considering the German medical law (AMG) and cost/benefit ratio.	1.0352319215859442
Evaluation of psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacological treatment frequently uses rating scales without regard for patients' defensiveness.	0.8152657542691532
This study demonstrates on 309 psychotherapy patients treated with inpatient client-centered therapy and followed-up 1 year after treatment that defensiveness, measured with validity scales of personality inventories MMPI-K, FPI-R and Gie√üen-Test, influences ratings (scales CGI, HAMA, HAMD, BRMES) before and after therapy.	0.9118879801820424
Patients who deny psychopathology on admission do so at discharge and to some extent at follow-up.	0.616598184371438
The extent of effect is significantly diminished with an increase in frankness in these patients, indicated by the significant improvement in validity scales.	0.8905734481751337
Inpatient client-centered psychotherapy improved defensiveness in the case of initial self-criticism and diminished it in the case of initial retentiveness.	1.0540255532954463
Introduction: Because of their frequency and consequences sciatica remains a demanding clinical entity with significant social and economical impact.	1.099016558701725
There is a high demand on therapeutic modalities, using folk medicine methods in the treatment of orthopaedic  diseases.	1.1170819253639452
No data is available on the usefullness of methods like natural herbs in combination with acupuncture.	0.824017453634944
Aim of our study was to present data on the effect of acupuncture and cytokineinhibiting natural herbs in sciatic pain.	0.8523871942753936
We compared these  results with nerve root infiltration by local anaesthetics and corticosteroids in our  orthopaedic outpatient clinic.	1.0429951215727682
Materials and Results: 278 patients with chronic pain for at least 3 months were observed.	1.1965056643218537
All three therapeutical modalities showed improvement of pain scores.	0.709990359765581
Best  results were gained with steroid injection (n=26; 66% pain reduction), acupuncture in combination with herbs improved the pain in average of 62% (n=230), whereas injection with local anaesthetic had a pain reduction of 48% (n=22).	1.1748195594164559
Sole Mepivacain-HCl treatment had significant less pain reduction compared to the other treatment modalities.	1.01929560215828
Conclusion: According to our results acupuncture in combination with herbs and  steroid nerve blocks appear to be an effective and thus recommendable conservative  therapy in cases of sciatic pain.	1.1047444999513112
Taking into account that patients increasingly prefer ethnomedical modalities of treatment our study gains importance for practising  orthopaedists.	0.9411602887870375
This paper concerns advances in the integration of psychotherapy in psychiatric education and clinical practice and whether they go along with increasing research activities.	1.0083309879011397
To find answers, a survey on psychotherapy research was carried out in all German psychiatric hospitals and departments by means of a questionnaire.	1.1042684328285879
The results indicate that psychotherapy research is done nearly exclusively in university hospitals.	0.7872979065771578
About half of them had already published psychotherapy studies and two thirds of them are presently carrying out studies, mostly including prospective, randomized clinical trials.	1.0918942213775629
These studies cover the whole spectrum of psychiatric disorders: substance abuse, schizophrenic and affective disorders, anxiety, and obsessive compulsive and personality disorders.	0.8658674893263656
To improve psychotherapy research conditions further, efforts are necessary to increase scientific exchange, financial support, and the integration of institutions outside the universities.	1.153765054353819
There is little to suggest that the course of preeclamsia can be substantially affected by drug treatment.	1.0054536426275946
The vast majority of randomized studies do not indicate beneficial effects of antihypertensive treatment on proteinuria, fetal heart rate abnormalities, abruptio placentae and the incidence of preterm birth.	0.9146115372571899
There is also no definite effect on the development of superimposed preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome, renal failure or eclampsia.	0.9838469550367993
Moreover, blood pressure lowering agents fail to improve uteroplacental perfusion but may have adverse effects on fetal growth.	1.131486699183039
Antihypertensive treatment is only indicated in severe hypertension ( > 170/110 mm Hg) to reduce the risk of cerebral hemorrhage.	1.1297180363812411
Dihydralazine injections may result in reduced placental blood flow and fetal distress.	0.8941831702661417
Oral nifedipine offers some advantages in view of more potent vasodilator actions on uterine and fetoplacental vessels and a lower incidence of fetal distress.	1.0024078955449902
Increasing evidence suggests that the mechanism of eclamptic seizure is cerebral vasoconstriction with resultant ischemia.	0.7900257930195296
Cerebral vessels are particularly sensitive to magnesium, which works by reversing cerebral vasoconstriction with resultant improvement in blood flow.	0.9576287095481006
Controlled trials have shown magnesium to be superior to both placebo and phenytoin for the prevention of eclampsia.	0.8897188651210107
Furthermore, magnesium has been found to be more effective than diazepam and phenytoin in preventing recurrence of seizures in women with eclampsia.	1.1841012479765016
Also the neonatal outcome favors magnesium, which is now generally accepted as the drug of choice for the prevention and treatment of eclampsia.	1.1046886466674826
Baker's cysts were treated operatively in 19 patients in the Department of Traumatology of the University of Cologne from 1988 to 1997.	1.0284162099227918
The subjective and objective results were evaluated with a questionnaire and a clinical examination and sonography (follow-up: 95 %).	1.047364527878371
All patients were examinated before surgery, sonography and X-ray of the knee were performed.	1.205265847449539
We differentiated between the congenital primary cyst (39 %), and the secondary form, which was always associated with an intraarticular lesion (61 %).	1.2206733493853945
Arthroscopy was performed in all secondary forms of Baker's cyst.	0.8885437463306766
Postoperative complications were two reinterventions due to one hematoma and one effusion.	0.8578475865369136
Patient's evaluation of operation result was "excellent" in 61 % and "good" in 39 % of cases.	1.1633661618658249
All knee joints had a full range of motion.	0.6657875519287433
There was only one case of a recurrent cyst.	1.2381541305851547
The primary form of Baker's cyst has always to be extirpated, according to our clinical experience.	0.8735735613466563
The extirpation of the secondary Baker's cyst and the relevance of arthroscopy and treatment of the basic disease have to be discussed.	1.045404636710248
In median avcuate ligament syndrome, compression of the celiac artery is caused by an abnormally low insertion of the median arcuate ligament in the presence of normally located celiac and superior mesenteric arteries.	0.9339061590257968
A lot of controversy exists concerning the indication for operation and the best mode of treatment.	0.9021254154156162
Depending on the presence and quality of collateral pathways, the symptoms vary considerably.	1.2607604229433056
We report a rare case of arcuate ligament syndrome with two-vessel involvement.	0.9074577595695498
In such cases surgical treatment seems to offer substantial benefit.	0.9975815710115934
Usually transsection of the compressing arcuate ligament is sufficient.	0.6894882606094412
Bypass procedures should remain limited to cases in which transsection does not enable a significant increase in splanchnic blood flow.	0.9011989040018171
The microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood films for the diagnosis of malaria is a highly sensitive technique.	0.9371563939997136
However, the expertise required is a major disadvantage.	1.1645924781271741
Recently, methods not dependent on microscopy have become commercially available.	1.0041677351720546
The use of an antigen-capture assay for the detection of histidine-rich protein 2, an antigen specific for Plasmodium falciparum, forms the basis of the ParaSight-F (Becton Dickinson) and the ICT Malaria Pf test (ICT Diagnostics).	1.09069594139499
Parasite lactate dehydrogenase is the basis of another immunographic dipstick assay developed by Flow Inc.	0.8831168797846646
These currently available assays have been evaluated in a number of trials giving sensitivities and specificities of 90-100%.	0.8261112155647498
A decreased sensitivity is found in cases with low parasitemia.	0.9727068379960199
However, false-negative  results have also been reported in patients with high parasite densities.	1.2980496015239753
Purpose: Discussion in the literature of peripheral nerve lesions after surgical treatment is based mainly on orthopedic surgery or on ischemic syndromes.	1.2951991601092074
There is no information about the frequency of nerve lesions after revascularization of the lower limb.	1.0170690064276742
Methods: Between 1992 and 1996, 436 patients underwent peripheral arterial revascularization, including 147 cases of deep revascularization, 127 supra-genicular femoro-popliteal bypasses, 116 infra-genicular femoro-popliteal bypasses and 56 femoro-crural bypasses.	0.9103308360101293
Mean patient age was 70.5 +/- 5.8 years; 182 patients were female and 254 were male.	0.8043031859366706
There was a 38% rate (166/436) of reoperation.	1.1484468885509702
All patients were examined based on anamnestic information and a detailed clinical neurological investigation, including the methods of Weber and Moberg.	1.1786002167942515
Results: We found eleven patients (4%) with peripheral nerve lesions after the primary operation.	1.4636793969571162
After the reoperation 55 patients (33%) had nerve lesions.	1.004095302487489
Conclusions: Peripheral nerve lesions with sensory disturbance were present in 15% of our patients on discharge from hospital.	1.2592218186900972
They had mainly dysesthesia and hypesthesia but no kind of motor dysfunction.	0.6988892777883033
In our opinion, detailed preoperative information is very important because of the risk of sensitive nerve lesions.	0.9142722513469816
Classic and HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) are predominantly found in male Caucasians.	1.05358394364875
It is unclear why KS is so rare in women.	0.8159105009005997
At the Department of Dermatology, University of Frankfurt, epidemic KS was diagnosed in 299/751 (40%) male and 5/72 (18%) female HIV-infected patients.	1.0250614569589902
To detect common parameters regarding immunodeficiency, hormonal disturbances, abnormalities in clinical course, or sexual practices, data of eight women with KS (five HIV+, three HIV-) were compared.	1.223721486384496
In HIV+ women KS is more aggressive than in HIV- women and more aggressive than in HIV+ men.	0.9625634959367169
Early and frequent visceral involvement and no preference for the lower extremities are found.	0.978900295320123
Compared to HIV- women with KS, HIV+ women are generally younger (mean age 38 vs 71 years) and significantly immunodeficient (reduced absolute CD4 cell count and CD4/CD8 ratio).	1.0548022400588524
All women with KS investigated for sexual hormones (7/8) showed abnormalities: 7/7 had low oestrogens, 4/6 low LH and 3/5 low progesterone.	1.2002224753781088
Controls (n=11, HIV+ without KS) showed a clear trend for higher serum levels of sexual hormones, but the difference was not significant.	1.0688290242601017
Although different reasons for low levels of oestrogens (drug abuse, marasmus, menopause) must be considered, the lack of oestrogens seems to be a common finding in HIV+ and HIV- women with KS.	1.0417613853311969
There was no correlation between sexual practices (anal or oral-faecal contacts) and the manifestation or aggressiveness of KS.	1.1010580380205912
The aim of the study was the assessment of left ventricular (LV) systolic function and left ventricular mass following aortic valve replacement (AVR) due to aortic valve stenosis as well as the influence of regression of LV hypertrophy in patients with normal and impaired LV systolic function prior to surgery.	1.153847685187194
74 patients with severe aortic valve stenosis (29 female, 45 male, mean age 66  +/-  18 years) were divided into 2 groups according to LV ejection fraction (EF): Group 1 with EF > 50% (n = 40); Group 2 with EF <= 50% (n = 34).	1.349683474299234
Furthermore, patients were differentiated into a group A without (n = 53) and a group B with aortic regurgitation (<= II ¬∞, n = 21).	1.4047474158587976
All patients were examined by transthoracic echocardiography before and 1 month after surgery.	1.2212365947481896
There was a significant decrease of LV enddiastolic and endsystolic valume indices following AVR in group 2 and group B.	1.0229588317229552
Patients with preoperatively lower EF (group 2) showed an increase in LV ejection fraction from 39  +/-  10% before AVR to 47  +/-  11% after AVR (p < 0.001), whereas patients with preoperative normal EF (group 1) showed a significant decrease in EF (from 62  +/-  8% to 57  +/-  10%, p < 0.05).	1.1596401061008639
Also patients with combined aortic valve disease before AVR had an increase of EF after surgery (from 45 %plusmn; 14% to 56  +/-  14%, p < 0.03).	1.0507463882802077
There were significant decreases of interventricular septum thickness and LV posterior wall thickness in group 1 and group A, whereas a significant decrease of LV anddiastolic diameter index was noted only in group B.	1.0774452043379243
Improvement of the NYHA functional class could be demonstrated in group 2 from 2.8  +/-  0.7 before to 2.2  +/-  0.6 after AVR, as well as in group B from 2.9  +/-  0.7 before to 1.9  +/-  0.7 after surgery.	1.232212390636398
In conclusion, patients with impaired LV function or combined aortic valve disease showed a significant improvement of left ventricular systolic function after AVR, while patients with normal LV function presented a slight decrease of EF.	1.2319965293477826
There was a significant regression of left ventricular muscle mass in all groups independent of the left ventricular functional status.	1.2489308670531774
Cardiomyocytes lose the ability to proliferate after birth.	0.6390567757164153
Subsequently, irreversible cellular damage, e.g., during myocardial infarction, causes loss of functional properties and cell replacement by fibrotic tissue.	1.1203780830339174
It is, therefore, not surprising that cell replacement strategies such as cardiomyocyte transplantation in damaged myocardium or scar tissue has gained widespread interest.	0.9635187756851401
In other species such as mice, rats, and dogs, the technical feasibility of skeletal myoblast-, satellite cell-, and fetal cardiomyocyte engraftment into normal and diseased myocardium has been demonstrated by simple injection methods.	1.1828275384085
Repeatedly, it has been shown that transplanted cells may survive for weeks within host myocardium and build intercellular connections such as grap junctions and desmosomes.	1.0014032093224556
In contrast, grafthost connections have not, as yet, been convincingly demonstrated.	1.0458134629713611
Hypothetically, cell transplants might exhibit the following functional properties: stabilization of diseased tissue to prevent structural remodeling; carrier for recombinant proteins, growth factors or drugs to induce molecular alterations of host myocardium; and improvement of regional and global myocardial function due to active contractility.	0.9836886185132149
However, clear evidence of coordinated contractility of transplanted cells, and, thus, of a clinically relevant therapeutical use of cardiomyocyte transplantation as a replacement strategy for damaged host cardiac cells, remains to be demonstrated.	1.214536772714065
Concomitant with advances in medicine, involving the development and use of antibiotics, immunosuppressive drugs, organ / stem cell transplantation and pre-existing illnesses such as AIDS, the frequency of fungal infection has increased dramatically.	1.0334529038710498
These factors determine the susceptibility of the lung for an acute or chronic course of disease.	1.0244766183323955
Purpose: We evaluated the speed of sound (SOS) and broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) at the os calcis as an indicator of osteoporosis and observed the age-related changes in ultrasound values in normal women.	1.187987838509978
Materials and methods: BUA and SOS were measured in 236 women using the "Achilles" densitometer (Lunar, Madison, Ohio).	0.9051127120433495
From the BUA and SOS values the BUA/SOS Index ("Stiffness" Index) is calculated.	1.0019127530064884
We investigated 55 female patients with osteoporosis (aged 43-85 years) and 181 healthy women (aged 20-80 years).	1.1194309467165284
Results: Ultrasound values for women with osteoporosis were significantly lower than those for the normal control group.	1.203020216099905
The Z-score compared with young normals was higher for the BUA/SOS Index (-3.1) than for BUA (-2.5) and SOS (-3.0).	1.2852351569609939
At a BUA/SOS Index of 68 the sensitivity was 85 %, and the specificity was 77 % for patients with osteoporotic fractures.	1.2728040243666536
We found a significant decline with age in SOS (r = -0.55), BUA (r = -0.50) and BUA/SOS Index (r = -0.57).	0.8465364023715484
Conclusion: Ultrasound bone densitometry at the os calcis can be used as a screening test in the diagnosis of osteoporosis.	1.1501312999672322
A treatment procedure requires the consent of the patient, but this is legally effective only if he is capable of giving his consent and can be informed accordingly.	0.9809950020756257
Because of demographic development and the progress of medicine, the number of patients who are not able to give their consent is increasing.	1.0972260350004688
In practice, we make do with the presumed consent of the patient or, for procedures that can wait, with the consent of legitimate family members.	1.2733159558918343
An initiative action is suggested by physicians and hospitals that should reduce this gray zone and the forensic risks drastically.	0.8850410308380581
A number of studies has shown a significant relationship between life events/life conditions and depression.	0.9397590942738403
However, there is only a small number of studies investigating the effect of life events/life conditions in patients with severe depression from the endogenous subtype.	1.2945428820457712
The present study examines the significance of the patients' life events/life conditions for the two year outcome of the illness in a prospective study with assessments every three months.	1.3177826114325255
Patients are compared to healthy controls with regard to the period three months prior to the admission to the hospital at the index episode.	1.1051476552879054
The results confirm the importance of life events and life conditions for the long term outcome of depressed patients with endogenous subtype respectively severe major depression in-patients.	1.1034321197237207
Relapsers show considerably more undesirable life conditions than non-relapsers three to six months prior to their relapse.	0.8296779745511446
Depressed patients indicate significantly more undesirable life events and life conditions and fewer desirable life conditions in comparison to the control group for the time span three months prior to their hospitalisation.	1.029820733613957
Since the availability of protease inhibitors in 1997, there has been a great change in antiretroviral therapy but also new long term side effects have emerged, mainly metabolic changes such as hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterinemia and hyperglycemia.	0.9569171905782495
Besides, fat redistribution has been observed.	0.6513911904394001
Fat wastes in the face and limbs but accumulates in the adipose tissue of the dorsocervical and abdominal region and the breasts.	0.907538877379842
The mechanism of these changes remains unclear.	0.8579006300869436
For therapy a protease inhibitor free therapy or lipid lowering drugs may be tried.	0.7982719068212131
29 of our 224 patients developed lipodystrophy.	0.7107602350620053
27 of these patients had been treated with a protease inhibitor (17 patients with indinavir); 2 of the patients had never received protease inhibitors.	1.3449208968973214
Background: The Low-Vision-Enhancement-System (LVESR) is the first binocular optoelectronic rehabilitation device with variable focus distance.	1.2053292001226719
DNA-cytophotometry is one of the methods that may contribute to a more precise evaluation of the biological behaviour of tumours in addition to the WHO-classification.	1.2970451667603273
In this study 121 tumour specimens of 50 patients suffering from gliomas with one or up to three recurrencies were investigated.	1.0516785159935385
In all cases the histological type and WHO-grade and the Ki-67/MIB1 labeling index were determined.	0.9928063053867888
DNA cytophotometry was performed after single cell preparation on Feulgen-stained preparations, and the following parameters were calculated: stemline ploidy, 5c-exceeding rate, and 2c-deviation index.	1.0932185709042999
There is a world-wide renaissance of neurosurgical treatments of Parkinson's disease (PD), based on substantial progress in basic sciences.	0.9570436942396656
A model of parallel motor circuitry has identified potential targets for lesioning by clarifying the pathophysiological role of the basal ganglia in PD.	0.8994126520388576
The internal globus pallidus (Gpi) is an essential player as it connects to thalamocortical projections and can be disinhibited by overactivity of the nucleus subthalamicus (Nst).	1.0051479813283501
Lesioning of these targets has been successful in MPTP damaged primates.	0.746532674382728
There is clinical use of destructive as well as restorative and stimulative technics.	0.8781278962807963
Pallidotomy and thalamatomy have evolved by the use of better neuroradiological and electrophysiological targeting.	0.7836130407521332
The first technic is used for treatment of rigidity, hypokinesia and dyskinesias, the latter one has proven to be efficient for tremor.	1.07505471195393
Dopaminergic reinnervation and increased dopaminergic output of the striatum has only been seen after transplantation of fetal cells; this method however carries immunological and ethical problems.	1.0061431283638274
The continuous high frequency stimulation of basal ganglia is the newest technic; it is highly adaptable to the patient's need and carries a low morbidity profile.	1.1542805978008643
Thalamic stimulation is used for the treatment of tremor.	0.9510991573705485
The stimulation of Nst and Gpi are proposed for dyskinesias and on/off phenomena.	0.7619658724704568
Animal research further focuses on xenotransplantation and implantation of genetically transformed cells or pluripotent precursor cells.	0.7819248700559353
- In summary neurosurgical procedures seem to be verey promising; however longterm comparison studies are needed to define the best (combination) treatment(s) for the future.	1.1614112249365385
Concepts of documentation rely not only on the contents required and technical demands, but the procedures covered and in medical applications especially security aspects are also matters of critical concern.	1.0934583973172163
Even though the need for effective documentation (i.e., adequate in content, availability, feasibility and easy to retrieve analysis) is not a question, tasks and aims (for example, quality of patient care) deserve attention and establishing efforts have to be analyzed regarding their structural and personal prerequisites and implications before particular tools for documentation can be developed.	1.0940522178493792
The Medtronic Thera/Thera-i (and Kappa 400) pacemakers utilize a mode switching algorithm that switches from the DDD/R mode to the DDIR mode in the presence on an atrial tachyarrhythmia.	0.9419846997439552
To accomplish this, the pacemaker keeps track of a mean atrial rate (MAR) which is a weighted index of the atrial rate.	1.2130710736144885
Once the MAR is greater than the programmed mode switch rate the pacemaker mode switches to the nontracking mode.	0.8050797911637945
Because the algorithm weights faster atrial rates more heavily than slow atrial rates, the algorithm is sensitive to a wide variety of atrial tachyarrhythmias, including those with varying amplitudes.	1.0957992504483798
Additionally, the algorithm provides a long PVARP and a rate adaptive (RA) AV interval.	0.9561876550685336
These not only help ensure that a wide range of atrial rates will be detected, but may also limit the time the patient tracks at the upper rate before mode switching.	1.1361629595430562
In order to assess the effectiveness of the algorithm, the Thera-i provides detailed diagnostics which provide information on the date, time, duration, and rate of the mode switch episodes.	1.1835388810675498
Additionally, more detailed beat-to-beat information is provided for each episode which can help determine its appropriateness and can assist in making programming changes.	1.156877883372721
There is a lot of information in the literature about psychological disturbances in somatic diseases.	1.212012958801609
For dermatological patients such data are not available.	0.6963707189221631
In early spring 1998 we studied the psychological changes in 247 hospitalized patients in the dermatological department of the Ruhr University Bochum.	0.9503920896995316
We used the German version of the internationally accepted Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.	0.7881470517385512
We found the prevalance of psychological alterations ranged between 25,9% and 31%.	1.0565343834291594
The prevalence of psychological disturbances was a little higher than that seen in oncological, cardiological or neurological patient populations.	0.9783344707578899
Surprisingly skin cancer patients were less affected than patients with chronic inflammatory or angiological diseases.	1.0450410885143029
These results underline the necessity of improved psychological therapeutical strategies which must be standardized and evaluated.	0.726850943826652
In an analysis of 3,838 restrained car drivers, the proportion of acceleration related injury of the cervical spine increased from under 10 % in 1985 to over 30 % in 1997.	1.271581916083552
These injuries occurred mainly in the case of head-on or multiple collisions.	0.9776331141896072
Letters were sent to 1,136 of the injured persons, and of the 138 patients who returned the questionnaires, 121 (88 %) were still suffering from their symptoms.	1.1520761127137984
It was a question of pain (74 %), tension (6 %) and stiffness (5 %) in the head (27 %), neck (55 %) and shoulder (8 %) area.	1.420056574104648
The duration of the complaints was the longest after multiple collisions.	0.9206894453461976
In addition to a slight influence of the accompanying injuries on the duration of complaints, the individual constitution seems to be an important determining factor.	1.2968010372602976
In order to resolve the difficulties of conducting of this retrospective study, prospective studies are necessary which include documentation of diagnosis, treatment protocols, duration and type of complaints.	1.1246606633701117
Large B-cell neoplasms represent one of the most frequent groups of non-Hodgkin-lymphomas (30-40%).	1.1066869107948052
They are characterised by an aggressive clinical course.	0.7904429349720267
These lymphomas may evolve either de novo or secondary during the course of a less aggressive lymphoma.	0.8742591440945031
In addition to primary nodal, a primary extranodal manifestation is rather common.	1.1870630231378951
The neoplastic cells, even within one given case, show a broad morphological spectrum.	1.0920713480023267
Several findings of the last two decades have revealed that the large B-cell lymphomas represent an inhomogeneous group.	1.1344604887687555
This fact has been taken into account by the new WHO classification of malignant lymphomas.	1.0648934005472284
There are two groups identified, that of the variants and that of the subtypes.	1.2395874354303493
The various variants (centroblastic, immunoblastic, anaplastic, T-cell/histiocyte-rich) correspond to lymphomas without reproducible discriminating criteria lacking characteristic clinical, immunophenotypical and genetic findings.	0.9243445344827521
In contrast, the primary mediastinal, the intravascular, the primary effusion and primary central nervous system lymphomas represent distinct disease entities.	1.2391010269321465
A number of recently described large cell lymphoma types, i. e. plasmablastic, ALK-positive and primary gastric, are included in the classification, their designation as distinct entities is still under discussion.	1.0844635925802457
In the presented study, knee joint proprioception of 43 patients with a patellar pain syndrome of the knee joint was evaluated.	1.2451193739350137
In a control group, the proprioception of 30 healthy volunteers with clinical and anamnestic inconspicous knee joints was examined.	0.9615704294737476
We tested the proprioceptive capability of the subjects with a passive angle reproduction test.	0.8506532296636837
Additionally, all knee joints were measured with and without an elastic knee bandage.	1.3050135987634015
The patient group showed significant deterioration of angle reproduction capability (13.2  ¬∞  +/-  6.1  ¬∞) compared to the control group (7.8  ¬∞  +/-  2.8  ¬∞).	1.171645657958508
After applying an elastic knee bandage, the angle reproduction capability significantly improved to 9.2  ¬∞  +/-  4.5  ¬∞.	1.219962069848735
Proprioception of the contralateral, noninvolved knee joint in the patients (11.6  ¬∞  +/-  6.3  ¬∞) was worse compared to the control group.	1.2901966111855765
Applying an elastic knee bandage did not significantly improve the proprioception of the uninjured knee joint.	0.8606335281584533
Atrial fibrillation is the most commonly encountered sustained arrhythmia in men.	1.142425643985476
It is associated with a two-fold mortality risk and an increased cost for health care providers.	0.9271446111662051
The relative inefficacy and the risks of pharmacologic approaches to atrial fibrillation therapy have contributed to increasing efforts to address atrial fibrillation with curative ablative strategies.	0.9347202364063618
Ablation approaches for atrial fibrillation focus on two alternate strategies: ablation of the substrate for initiation and ablation of the substrate for maintenance of atrial fibrillation.	0.7237229510093051
It has been demonstrated that atrial fibrillation may be initiated by repetitive atrial premature beats originating from a single focus.	1.0181953554497618
These ectopic foci can be mapped and ablated, thereby removing the substrate for initiation of atrial fibrillation.	0.8622577961335708
Most often, these atrial premature beats arise from the pulmonary veins.	1.019708044467944
A challenge in trying to ablate the trigger is actually having enough spontaneous activity from the said focus throughout the electrophysiologic study.	0.7599213564057318
To sidestep the need of mapping, pure anatomic approaches are currently under investigation to electrically isolate the pulmonary veins from the atrial myocardium by circumferential lesions.	0.9502560574913347
In patients without a defined trigger for atrial fibrillation, efforts were made to ablate the substrate for maintenance of atrial fibrillation.	0.9068760253168477
Strong evidence exists that atrial fibrillation is the result of multiple coexisting reentrant wavelets requiring a critical myocardial mass to perpetuate.	0.898097488551672
Several working groups demonstrated that intraoperative compartmentalization of the myocardial tissue by surgical incisions or radiofrequency pulses is highly effective in preventing atrial fibrillation.	0.8859059905122975
Currently, attempts were made to reproduce the surgical technique using transveneous, catheter-based approaches.	1.0940646787306652
Though our knowledge of ablation techniques and technical prerequisites is continuously increasing, the difficulty to produce complete linear lesions in the left atrium and local thrombus formation at the ablation line are problems that are still not solved.	1.109421067491484
Using a time-budget method in a 3 year longitudinal study with a control group design, substantial reductions in the engagement of non-obligatory instrumental, social, and leisure activities could be found in a group of mildly to moderately demented patients.	1.030213797397742
Controlling these changes for differences in baseline paramters, the dementia-specific reduction was about 1,5 hours compared to a non-psychiatric control group.	1.0918194659839233
These clinically relevant changes in activity levels underscore the importance of these activity domains with regard to the development of diagnostically useful indicators at the early stages of dementia.	0.9997648020940597
Time-budget methods seem to be particularly useful to close the diagnostic gap with regard to the assessment of everyday competence indicators especially at early stages of the dementia illness.	1.088312155632869
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a disease with different etiological, morphological, functional, clinical and therapeutic aspects.	1.2006207137786924
Recent investigations indicate that HCM is considerably widespread in the population (1:500).	1.0499911807346194
The causes seem to generate from familial or sporadic abnormalities (mutations).	0.8257493909520381
Depending on the clinical aspect, the complaints, and on the basis of morphologic and hemodynamic investigational results, we mainly have to consider two types of medical and surgical management.	1.2750398928281756
Atrial fibrillation is in 20-50% the most frequent dysrhythmia after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and a possible cause for hemodynamical complications and prolongation off the medical treatment in patients.	1.2987183284662125
Therefore, the effect of -blocking with metoprolol for prevention of supraventricular arrhythmias (SVA) was investigated in a prospective and randomized trial.	1.1978643841665242
200 patients after CABG were randomized in a drug and control group (average age 63.2 years, 154 male, 46 female).	0.9791474141021134
Patients of the drug group (n=100) were treated with metoprolol (1mg/kg/BW) beginning on day one after operation, whereas patients of the control group (n=100) received therapy only in case of occurrence of atrial fibrillaton.	1.1052436589183363
ECG, blood pressure, and electrolyte concentrations were measured regulary until the tenth day after surgery.	0.9307848588957122
Reasons for exclusion were an ejection fraction (< 30%, SA- and AV-block or simultaneous application of epinephrine and metoprolol.	1.2156289099273536
There were no significant differences between the patients of drug and control group with respect to age, sex ejection fraction, previous medication, number and type of bypass grafts, cardiopulmonary bypass time, and perioperative ischemic events.	1.1661729066523896
However, a statistically significant difference was seen in the occurrence of supraventricular arrhythmias in both groups, 4 patients of the therapy group (4%) in contrast to 37 patients of the control (37%) developed supraventricular arrhythmias during the postoperative observation period (p<0.0001).	1.340801851274256
Both groups differed in total time of hospital stay by 1.5 days (control group: 9.83 +/- 2.88 days; drug group: 8.42 +/- 2.81 days), which was statistically significant (p<0.05).	1.0966202393686197
All patients of the drug group could be discharged with a stable sinusrhythm, whereas 7 patients of the control group were discharged with persistent atrial fibrillation.	1.2077869578911606
The difference was statistically significant as well (p<0.01).	0.6513685025214377
Neither typical side effects of metoprolol, nor AV-blocks, bradycardia (f<60/min) or symptoms of low blood pressure could be observed.	1.0593354918453917
The conclusion of this trial is a recommendation for a preventive application of 50mg metoprolol/day after coronary artery bypass surgery, which can reduce the incidence of SVA as well as the hospital stay statistically significant.	1.2088614312164423
Especially by using the "Functional Muscular Diagnostics" described by Janda specific muscular imbalances can be found.	0.8798437108719142
The method is easy to apply and should be used during and before the championship season.	0.9556474320428651
Background: Angiotensin converting  enzyme-inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors) alter the function of the renin-angiotensin-aldesterone-system, which regulates the angiotensin II synthesis.	1.0668126030544447
Angiotensine II is known to be a potent vasoconstrictor.	1.1277980639673406
ACE-inhibitors are used as a standard treatment of arterial hypertension concerning the WHO-guidelines.	1.1814143336937888
The experiences concerning the use of ACE-inhibitors in pediatric patients are  limited.	0.9297759743825355
The frequency of side-effects are not known on a sufficient scientific basis.	1.02291688566886
Evoked potentials (EP) are a valuable tool when assessment of neurocritical care patients is impaired by loss of consciousness and lack of co-operation.	1.0555739229970122
Different modalities of short latency EP can be applied to evaluate sensory, auditory and visual systems.	0.977715811817308
In this review we discuss EP studies in patients with thrombosis of basilar artery, space occupying cerebellar infarction and supratentorial mass lesions of different aetiology.	0.8955386202431422
Paclitaxel, a potent anti-tumor agent, shifts the cytoskeleton equilibrium towards assembly of altered and extraordinarily stable microtubules.	0.9272655043843417
These cellular modifications lead to reduced proliferation, migration, and signal transduction.	0.9824417293560695
It is highly lipophilic, which promotes a rapid cellular uptake, and has a long-lasting effect in the cell due to the structural alteration of the cytoskeleton.	1.3566742919572088
This makes paclitaxel a promising candidate for local drug delivery intended to address the proliferative and migratory processes involved in restenosis.	0.8143247573509256
In this article, results of our in vitro and in vivo studies with paclitaxel are presented.	0.9963101603959436
Cell culture experiments with monocultures of human arterial smooth muscle cells as well as cocultures with human endothelial cells showed that paclitaxel leads to an almost complete growth inhibition within a dose range of 1.0-10.0¬µmol/l, even after a short (20 min) single dose application.	1.1983020314809265
The comparison of an active, semi-active, and passive delivery system (porous balloon, microporous balloon, and double balloon) favored the double balloon for the following in vivo experiments.	1.1055597630545408
Tubulin staining and electron microscopy enabled visualization of paclitaxel-induced vessel wall alterations.	0.7982708493941192
In the rabbit model, locally delivered paclitaxel resulted in reduced neointima formation and enlargement in vessel size; in the pig model, however, after stenting, this inhibition was not significant.	1.0854483841114406
Both reduced proliferation and enlargement in vessel size contribute to a preservation of vessel shape and are likely to be caused by a structural alteration of the cytoskeleton, which is also supported by vascular contraction force experiments.	1.084018580145778
Atopic eczema is one of the most frequent dermatological diseases, with a still increasing incidence.	1.1378111752834466
Although its etiopathogenesis is still not completely understood, a variety of triggering factors are known.	1.0243819702493162
The following case report describes the clinical course of atopic dermatitis in a 2-year-old boy in whom both IgE-mediated allergic reactions and psychological factors were involved in triggering and maintenance of skin lesions.	1.0625519467197848
This demonstrates how important both dermatological therapy and close cooperation with the field of psychosomatic medicine can be.	0.9549981884744895
Identity development in adolescence may act as stressor triggering juvenile psychotic episodes.	0.7136639556891002
A model is being presented stating that self development in subjects with high vulnerability for psychosis leads to the establishment of an "imaginary self" consisting of phantasies and fictions without taking into account facts and social realities.	0.8810724493155172
The "imaginary self" stabilizes irritating self deficiencies, thus leading to a vulnerability for depersonalisation and identity diffusion during actual turmoils of adaptation.	0.8428850037615426
Biomaterials are defined as non-living materials which are used in interaction with biological systems.	0.8914996887127425
Especially in the field of urology, biomaterials are applied in urinary diversion, urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, and as cosmetic prostheses.	1.1077691926954918
Biomaterial-tissue interaction is caused by the physical and chemical characteristics of the biomaterial, its degradation, and the resulting protein denaturation.	1.3046770945583288
General requirements include biocompatibility and functionality and the avoidance of carcinogenic, mutagenic, toxic, and allergic reactions.	0.9751451296857782
This ist most important when there is permanent contact between urine and epithelial tissue, which may lead to biofilminfection and incrustation.	0.9613979987082327
Continuous modification of known materials, inauguration of new materials, as well as the possibilities of tissue engineering will determine their development in the years to come.	1.092993579458301
Hitherto the question of an indication for psychoanalytic group psychotherapy has not been clarified sufficiently.	1.109669685905991
In this paper, under the premise, that psychoanalytic group psychotherapy is a treatment mode in its own right, the issue is investigated which patients might best profit from the group treatment method.	1.1087971061765058
It is pointed out that the group process itself contains a variety of therapeutic treatment factors which cannot be facilitated through psychoanalytic treatment of just one patient.	0.8789587009149235
First, a series of diagnostic, structural, motivational and cognitive indication criteria are discussed.	0.999934885037643
Second, the moments of a capacity for cohesion and aspects of social relatedness are considered as helpful tools for a formulation of an indication.	1.0648821987716477
As cohesion - according to group treatment outcome research results - has to be viewed as correspondent to the helpful therapeutic alliance, in the context of group psychotherapy, the quest for indication is inextricably linked to patient selection and setting conditions.	1.1840778657248756
The conclusion is that psychoanalytic group psychotherapy, would preferably be indicated for those patients who suffer from constraints of emotional competence as stemming from developmental deficits.	0.8487777150739491
Purpose: To evaluate method- and user effects as well as the required time in the determination of left- and right ventricular ejection fractions in comparing manual and semiautomatic border detection of the endocardium.	1.3006195966376066
The diagnosis of urinary tract infection in renal transplant patients is important because unrecognized bacterial infection may lead - in the worst case - to graft loss.	1.2939522859375494
Between January 1995 and January 1997, we therefore obtained bladder catheter urine samples in 31 female allograft recipients when voided urine samples repeatedly showed pyuria (>=10 WC per microscope field (x40)) and significant bacteriuria (>=;105/ml) combined with vaginal contamination (plenty of squamous epithelial cells, mixed bacterial growth).	1.0849250970615334
Results: In 55 % (17/31), diagnosis of urinary tract infection was confirmed by single bladder catheterization; in 26 % (8/31), urinary tract infection could be excluded, and in 19 % (6/31), bladder colonization without pyuria was found.	1.4784279460634258
Thus, 45 % of the patients with abnormal voided urine samples did not need antimicrobials.	1.2555778516452847
After single dose antibiotic therapy with 500 mg Ciprofloxacin, given immediately after catheterization, no infectious complications occurred.	1.0189872929284938
Diagnostic single bladder catheterization is a simple, safe and - compared to suprapubic aspiration - barely invasive method for the diagnosis or exclusion of urinary tract infection in female renal transplant patients with higher risk for complications due to an acute bladder infection and non-conclusive voided urine samples.	1.1268454470761315
Most people with the Metabolic Syndrome die from thrombotic complications superimposed to degenerative arterial vascular lesions, mostly myocardial infarction.	0.8647712263789075
Type-2-Diabetes is a risk factor per se for such complications, but often clusters with dyslipoproteinemia, hypertension and obesity.	1.2137366757433503
This is referred to as "Metabolic Syndrome" and often operates on a genetically programmed susceptibility which accelerates the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease in front of a much wider diabetes specific cardiopathy.	1.0656326139732335
From a pathophysiological point of view none of these associated risk factors explains the pathogenetic series of events leading to the precipitation of an occlusive thrombus at sites of complicated coronary plaques.	0.9404645940681222
In patients with the Metabolic Syndrome the coagulation system is switched towards a prethrombotic state, involving increased plasmatic coagulation, diminished fibrinolysis, decreased endothelial thromboresistance and predominantly platelet hyperreactivity ("diabetic thrombocytopathy").	1.0328858155588803
Some of these factors are associated with an increased coronary risk (e.g.	0.9026689756595754
fibrinogen, PAI-1, platelets), but are also directly linked to the pathogenesis of "atherothrombosis".	1.1576546944214816
Altered cardiac remodelling together with adhesion and coagulation mechanisms appears suitable to explain decreased functional performance of infarcted organs, decreased success of acute (reduced fibrinolytic response, no reflow phenomenon) and longterm intervention strategies for vessel patency (PTCA, CABG) in Diabetes.	1.113563678900775
Glucose adjustment alone will not adequately neutralize these complex mechanisms, but in the situation of myocardial infarction eumetabolization with parenteral glucose-insulin-potassium infusion appears mandatory similar to non-diabetics.	1.0118191231984122
On the longterm a multidimensional interventional repertoire is required particularly in patients with the Metabolic Syndrome including antihypertensive, antidyslipoproteinemic and antithrombotic drugs, customized according to the individual patients needs as assessed by early diagnostic measures ("early secondary prevention").	1.0600140217306884
The indication for operative treatment in spondylolisthesis results from pain, progressive sliding and, in up to 60 % of the patients with progressive dislocation, from radicular malfunction.	1.253703549164336
The posterolateral fusion in situ is a safe procedure, but the deformation remains and in spondyloptosis plastic deformation of the fusion mass can lead to further dislocation.	1.1577357498324905
With the external fixator as an instrument for reduction and the internal fixator for stabilization the reduction of even serious spondyloptosis and the recovery of a normal spine alignement and posture is possible, with an acceptable neurological risk.	1.1334551200522813
Therefore a concept of treatment is suggested, which as a rule is aiming at the anatomical reduction of the dislocated vertrebra beside stabilization and nerveroot decompression.	1.1003467020570559
Depending on the extent of the slip, reduction and stabilization is to be performed in one, two or three stages.	1.3405259854862899
An anterior or posterior fusion is sufficient in grade I dislocation.	0.823429488663872
In grade II-V a combined posterior and anterior surgical proceedure is recommended.	0.831951029588536
Objectives: This study was conducted to evaluate a modified technique of interskalene brachial plexus anaesthesia (ISB) and postoperative catheter analgesia for shoulder surgery.	1.1823627403752377
The original method described by Winnie bears some rare but life-threatening complications (inadvertent subarachnoid or intra-arterial injection, pneumothorax).	0.9183016685241765
Objectives: Due to its low solubility and negligible metabolism, desflurane is assumed to be especially suitable for application by low-flow anaesthetic techniques.	0.9718573602197517
The aim of this clinical investigation was the development of a standardised dosing scheme for low-flow and minimal-flow desflurane anaesthesia.	1.2089217444721099
Methods: One hundred six ASA status I-II patients were assigned to six groups according to the duration of the initial high-flow phase, fresh gas flow, and fresh-gas desflurane concentration.	1.1226321270714887
The median age, height, body weight, and constitution of the groups was comparable.	1.0498152445989946
After an initial high-flow phase using 4.4 l/min, the fresh gas flow was reduced to 0.5 l/min (minimal-flow anaesthesia) or 1.0 l/min (low-flow anaesthesia).	1.087341703442157
Inspired nitrous oxide concentrations were maintained at 60% to 70%.	0.9875161329987193
Using different standardised schemes of vaporizer settings, inspired desflurane concentrations were applied in the range from 3.4% to 8.7%, i.e., between 1 and 1.5 MAC.	1.3866958025559835
Inspired and expired desflurane concentrations were measured continuously by the side-stream technique and recorded on-line.	0.9450580419228112
Venous blood samples were taken immediately prior to induction and 45 min after flow reduction for measurement of carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) concentration).	0.8455934890847392
Results: In the 10- to 15-min initial phase during which a high fresh gas flow of 4.4 l/min was used, the inspired desflurane concentration reached values in the range of 90%-95% of the fresh gas concentration.	1.3343049579415933
In low-flow anaesthesia this concentration could be maintained without any alteration of the vaporizer setting, whereas in minimal-flow anaesthesia with flow reduction the fresh gas concentration had to be increased by 1% to 2%: The quotient calculated by division of the inspired desflurane concentration by its fresh gas concentration (Q=CI/CF) ranges between 0.65 and 0.75 in minimal-flow and between 0.80 and 0.85 in low-flow anaesthesia.	1.198443895020132
If use was made of the wide output range of the desflurane vaporizer, the inspired concentration could be increased rapidly by about 5% in 8 min, although the flow was kept constant at 0.5 l/min.	1.1807051573393854
Compared with its value prior to induction (2.13 +/- 1.05%), the COHb concentration decreased statistically significantly by about 0.7% during the 1st hour of minimal-flow anaesthesia (1.42 +/- 1.01%).	1.2486246316857725
In no case was a COHb concentration observed that exceeded threatening or even toxic values, although the soda lime was changed routinely only once a week.	0.9280309678819603
Conclusions: The pharmacokinetic properties of desflurane, resulting in especially low individual uptake, and the wide output range of the vaporizer facilitate the use of low-flow anaesthetic techniques in routine clinical practice.	1.1522991398582842
Even in minimal-flow anaesthesia, the duration of the initial high-flow phase can be shortened to min.	0.8218613826189606
If the flow is reduced to 1 l/min, the inspired desflurane concentration achieved in the initial high-flow phase can be maintained without any alteration of the vaporizer setting.	0.8969390621164852
In minimal-flow anaesthesia, however, with flow reduction to 0.5 l/min, the fresh gas concentration has to be increased to a value 1%-2% higher than the inspired nominal value.	1.226570452428178
Due to the wide dialling range of the desflurane vaporizer, the amount of vapour delivered into the breathing system can be increased to about 110 ml/min even at a flow of 0.5 l/min.	0.9859586462710517
The large amount of agent that can be delivered into the system even under low-flow conditions, together with the very low individual uptake, results in a time-constant that is sufficiently short for the clinically required rapid increase in inspired desflurane concentrations.	1.0148326755168038
The short time-constant of low-flow desflurane anaesthesia improves the control of the anaesthetic concentration.	1.054468537167008
If all measures are taken to safely avoid inadvertent drying out of the soda lime, there is no evidence that low-flow anaesthesia with desflurane is liable to increase the risk of accidental ca	1.0000752316970918
Arterial port systems are frequently used in the adjuvant and palliative therapy of colorectal hepatic metastasis.	0.9591807061307513
Specific complications are rarely documented in literature.	0.7432441742401097
The perforation of an arterial Port-a-cath followed by duodenal fistula is an uncommon complication of regional hepatic chemotherapy.	0.9787387590973692
Besides systemic disorders caused by the chemotherapeutic agents, such as vomiting, sickness, or gastritis and duodenitis, gastroduodenal ulcers can occur as a local complication of treatment.	0.9945242337592656
Thrombosis of the hepatic artery or occlusion of the port device are the most common reasons for withdrawal of treatment in our series.	1.118174704721173
Based on our experience and the case report of a duodenal fistula we recommend angiography of the port system prior to each cycle of chemotherapy.	1.0308280416366826
Background: Coenesthesias can be defined as disorders of body perception or body hallucinations, projected in different parts of the body.	1.0646901515004572
Patients complain of intractable pain or dysesthesia.	0.6075844158717
These symptoms are reported even from organs where we usually have no perception.	0.8676588262168046
Coenesthesia must be regarded as a symptom that can be observed in various psychiatric diseases, e.g., schizophrenia.	1.0332560629324403
However, in rare cases coenesthesias can be documented in neurological diseases, e.g., intracranial tumors or infections.	1.0785467515072942
Therefore, accurate assessment of possible differential diagnoses is important.	1.2669121781892214
In late stages, coenesthesias can easily be recognized because of their "bizarre" character.	0.8505214246365413
In early stages, however, patients often complain of intractable, unlocalizable burning pain.	1.115966286095692
They frequently undergo operations because of their great suffering.	0.8028139990499511
The drug treatment of first choice is neuroleptics, but the results are unpredictable.	1.3657034981396536
Question: What risks do different forms of immunosuppression (azathioprine, Cyclosporin, azathioprine/Cyclosporin plus steroids) represent in pregnancy for the mother and fetus after kidney transplantation?	0.9478995693921188
Retrospective analysis of 40 pregnancies and deliveries.	0.7671389873568136
Investigation of abortion -, premature birth rate, fetal retardation, malformation, hospitalization, modus of labour, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal mortality, hypertonia, preeclampsia, anemia, kidney function, rejection crisis, mechanical compression, kidney function after 1 and 5 years postpartum.	1.0655821610984206
Recommendation guideline: preconceptional time (contraception) and intensive care in pregnancy.	1.0009215339163382
The risk of pregnancy is justified if the presuppositions are correct and the woman would urgently like to have a child.	0.9545829879566129
Studies on the everyday life of the elderly often deal with visible behavior.	0.961379574069232
In this study, the subjective experience of the everyday living environment was investigated, paying special consideration to the role of mobility impairment.	1.0746786445644783
Two approaches, one oriented toward the subject's experience of the home environment, another oriented toward the environmental specifics of the individual's favorite place, were employed.	1.0841493315162078
Is the experience of living at home different for individuals with various levelsults were found in the experience of cognitive, biographical, and spatial dimensions of the living environment.	1.0387126256476888
Similarities were found in the experience of emotional, social, and behavioral dimensions of one's home.	1.0234723428060037
Competence loss played an important role in how the subjects experienced living at home, yet even the mobility impaired experienced their home as a environment which could be shaped.	0.9759112361206249
The environment-oriented approach showed that the favorite place of mobility impaired persons was characterized by higher spatial density.	0.9061580757117343
Finally, an examination of four home environment profiles using cluster analysis illustrated the connection between both person- and environment-oriented approaches and offered insights into a transactional perspective of person and environment.	1.0711684516391373
Even though the subjective experience of one's home environment is not easily quantifiable in terms of maintaining everyday competence, it nonetheless imparts meaning to the elderly person's daily life.	1.0698793337740056
The main advantage of the bilateral medial rectus faden operation (posterior fixation suture) for the treatment of essential infantile esotropia is the low occurrence of delayed consecutive exotropia.	1.0064058766924076
Nevertheless, this unwanted complication also occasionally occurs after a faden operation.	1.1122836074736724
We report the rare development of a myoepithelial carcinoma in a pleomorphic adenoma involving the minor salivary glands in the buccal mucosa of a 78-year-old female.	0.9972509951423683
Tumor presented as a small asymptomatic left buccal mass.	0.7510433463496342
The initial dominant component of the neoplasm was a pleomorphic adenoma, while the minor component was a myoepithelial carcinoma.	0.9770050495937757
Recurrences of tumor after 2 and then 5 years were excised.	1.0145167942455178
Histopathological examination of the last tissue removed showed a pure myoepithelial carcinoma of the minor salivary glands without evidence for a pleomorphic adenoma.	0.9688888364833965
The clinical features, therapy, diagnosis, histopathology and literature are reviewed.	0.7315898098657787
The purpose of this prospective study was to determine concomittant lesions of glenohumeral dislocation and their correlation with the outcome, to determine the influence of various stabilizing operation techniques on the outcome.	1.2130607520289545
106 shoulders [104 patients, 81 men, 23 women, mean age 36 (16-83) years] operated because of shoulder instability after at minimum one shoulder luxation between 1988 to 1995 were evaluated 3 years (0.8-8 years) postoperatively using Constant score.	1.190922705021399
Preoperative arthroscopy was performed to document intraarticular lesions.	1.0443772352883103
There were 7 reluxations (5 because of a new accident), mostly after Putti-Platt procedures.	1.339239819587979
The average modified Constant Score was 66 (10-85) points (maximum 85).	0.9974349470220916
29 patients (27%) had less than 60 points, mostly because of pain and restriction of function, and were evaluated as poor.	1.1809802371711227
Lesions of rotator cuff, long biceps tendon and subscapularis tendon had a bad prognosis.	0.8638330539364372
The severity of arthroscopically found lesions correlated with the outcome.	0.8585146192632187
Operations with shortening of subscapularis tendon or using a bone graft gave bad results.	0.8068662644792565
Anatomic reconstruction of the labrum-ligament complex in combination with a plasty of the extended capsule gave best results.	0.98430129488125
Preoperative arthroscopy can determine the extent of different lesions after shoulder luxation which influence the outcome and is useful to select the optimal operation technique.	0.9938508967907385
Prenatal determination of fetal blood groups by DNA amplification today is possible for Rhesus D, eE, cC, Kell (K1/2), Duffy (Fya/b) and Kidd (Jka/b).	0.9915750904564653
Current assays using multiplex PCR and at least two specific primers as well as an intern control offer a diagnostic power of more than 99%.	1.00187301572712
In all pregnancies complicated by irregular blood group antibodies, blood group typing in amniotic fluid allows to reduce the number of invasive procedures.	0.8871087177299388
PCR typing is recommended in all cases with a heterozygous father and an increased antibody level or suspicious findings during ultrasound evaluation.	1.037249334120926
Adjuvant therapy with interferon for malignant melanoma causes neurotoxic side effects such as depression.	0.8299363209926628
The biochemical mechanisms are unknown.	0.5585878603222337
We report two cases with both depression and amnesia.	0.8497882217777469
In one case, attempted suicide was a companied by 7 h of amnesia.	0.7805712634619715
The diagnostic classification and possible explanations for the amnesia secondary to interferon therapy are reviewed.	0.857136075350144
Molecular and epidemiological studies have confirmed that human pathogenic papillomaviruses (HPV)types 16 and 18 are causally involved in the developement of carcinoma of the cervix.	0.9431035560623994
This statement is also true, albeit with reservations as yet, of other so-called high-risk HPV types, such as HPV 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56 and 58.	1.2188741337185858
Around 500,000 women throughout the world become ill with carcinoma of the cervix every year, and 1-4% of all younger women have a precancer of the cervix uteri.	1.33524281100944
This knowledge of the viral origin of anogenital neoplasms has not yet been exploited for primary and secondary prevention of these illnesses, however.	1.0670713927772957
This is mainly because infection with genital HPV types is very prevalent in young women but seldom leads to carcinoma.	0.8418970413555102
In this review, therefore, the most important epidemiological data available on cervical carcinoma and its preliminary stages are analysed with reference to an association with HPV.	1.0699611638721767
In addition, the molecular biological data on HPV as it relates to anogenital carcinogenesis are presented.	0.9118731778027493
In conclusion, the significance of HPV for the prevention of carcinoma of the cervix is discussed.	0.9748830878164594
We report the case of a 43-year-old woman who had a cardiogenic shock due to an acute inferior myocardial infarction.	1.0064213835167124
Her husband and a general practitioner living in the neighborhood initially performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation.	0.9115226947432435
A prehospital emergency physician found ventricular fibrillation when he arrived after 20 minutes.	0.7770825822878666
It was impossible to achieve stable rhythm by 42 attemps of defibrillation.	0.7567918282062143
Therefore, the patient was carried to our clinic under ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation.	1.2368365606691198
A cardiologist was informed with radio signal.	0.5499314452584823
Percutaneous cardiopulmonary support (pCPS) was implanted in the emergency department after 100 minutes of cardiac arrest.	1.1166317186102088
After stabilizing the hemodynamic situation by pCPS (4-5 l/min) it was possible to transfer the patient to the catheterization laboratory.	1.1252612149414338
Angiography revealed proximal occlusion of a dominant right coronary artery.	0.7641508252894353
After successful angioplasty it was possible to reestablish stable sinus rhythm by single defibrillation.	0.9553492128498342
By use of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) the flow rate of pCPS was reduced every two hours.	0.9850505844578588
After 10 hours of support pCPS was explaned.	0.710480083606591
IABP was needed for three days.	0.6184512084231477
The patient was discharged from hospital without any relevant neurological deficits after nine weeks.	0.9168692285269836
By using pCPS it is possible to stabilize the patient's hemodynamic situation and to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures if other means of resuscitation do not suffice.	1.1386539040946941
The use of pCPS in resuscitation is indicated in circulatory arrest if further therapeutic options seem promising.	0.8940451079044889
Defects of the frontoorbital complex subsequent to extensive tumor surgery or severe trauma often result in aesthetic and functional disharmonies.	0.8443066918195486
The long-term results of rehabilitation related to different materials and techniques are the subject of this study.	1.2615515713357714
From 1974 to 1996 altogether 127 patients with bony defects of the orbit and/or the skull base underwent surgery.	1.0987436109726945
All patients' data were documented prospectively from 1984 onwards.	0.8149648421434194
The results following reconstruction with autologous calvarian transplants in 52 patients were compared to those of a control group which received iliac bone or PMMA implants.	1.0256096145703024
Eighty-one bony defects (64%) resulted from tumor resection; 37 patients (29%) suffered from the effects of trauma.	1.111184084355414
In 67 cases (53%) reconstruction was performed primarily, in 51 cases (40%) secondarily.	1.2685546211422103
Free or pedicled soft-tissue transplants were necessary in order to separate the orbit and the neurocranium in 26% of the defects.	1.0605013100709504
On the other hand, small, isolated defects of the orbital roof (7%) were left without any reconstructive procedure.	1.2560700902701873
Contrary to the iliac bone grafts, the calvarian transplants resisted secondary resorption.	0.9125203548932
Postoperative infections appeared in two cases; loss of transplants was avoided entirely in the group of calvarian reconstructions in contrast to the alloplasts.	1.1031686004030778
The selection of a suitable donor site area and rigid fixation with microplates led to excellent esthetic results even in cases with large defects.	1.0124737889750377
Within inpatient psychotherapy traditionally different therapeutic approaches are combined.	0.8014458583611386
Usually verbal interventions of different orientations and settings (e.g.	0.5666467957958542
individual and group therapy), nonverbal procedures (e.g.	0.8508915620506794
music and art therapy) and bodyoriented techniques are included.	0.8564822314380298
The combinations is merely additive, integrated or eclectic.	0.7414323551546244
Little is known about the reciprocal interrelation of such combinations.	0.6859656760371928
Along the example of a definite additive combination of psychodynamic and behavioural psychotherapy for agoraphobias and obsessive disorders a rationale for the interrelationship of the different therapeutic components is discussed.	0.9412315636502426
We report an 18-year old woman with surgically proven primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) and normal intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) serum levels.	1.0734808433372467
The reason for this rare biochemical presentation are possible biologically active amino-terminal parathyroid hormone polypeptide fragments not detected by the widely used two-site immunoradiometric parathyroid hormone assay (PTH IRMA).	0.9525503060128323
Diagnosis and therapy of primary hyperparathyroidism therefore should not exclusively rest on the finding of hypercalcemia coupled with an elevated iPTH level.	1.031054014452067
Viral hepatitis belongs to the most important infectious diseases worldwide.	0.8529020141561768
More than 300 million chronic HBsAg carriers and chronic HCV carriers exist, respectively.	0.6669893706947879
High endemic areas of viral hepatitis are Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Near, Middle and Far East.	0.8372473187388426
Viral hepatitis is also very important in health care workers.	0.8841907465439408
Today viral hepatitis can be differentiated from type A to type E (G) based on immunological and molecular assays.	1.0247033422268703
While enterally transmitted hepatitis type A and type E only induce acute and rare fulminant disease, hepatitis type B, C and D often induce chronic progressive disease including liver cirrhosis with typical complications due to the portal hypertension and with a high rate of association with the development of primary liver cancer (HCC).	1.0682641801186306
This review focusses on viral hepatitis-related surgical problems, including liver transplantation.	0.9412712632460415
Hypertensive diseases in pregnancy (HDP) are one of the most frequent causes of maternal death and perinatal mortality.	1.0721383267474514
However, chronic hypertension without complications has a more favorable prognosis than preeclampsia.	1.3515879254773149
Apart from a familial predisposition, mutations of various genes may also be responsible; among these, APC resistance is of particular clinical significance.	1.0839789351950397
The insufficient endovascular invasion of trophoblast in the spiral aterioles is still considered to represent the pathogenetic basis of preeclampsia.	0.865085760618462
Increased lipid oxidation, deported membrane components of syncytiotrophoblasts, and increased invasion of fetal cells in the maternal circulation triggering immunological reactions are discussed as the causes.	1.0791580659014262
The result is an endothelial imbalance between vasoconstrictory-aggregating and vasodilatatory-antiaggregating compounds.	0.8180678740097476
The results of studies on the relevance of NO synthase are controversial.	0.9473936316008296
Currently, neither reliable methods for the early detection nor certain preventative measures to avoid the disease are available.	1.2500853036185144
Intensive care monitoring and therapy are essential for pregnant women with severe HDP.	1.0690392173899785
The obstetric procedure depends on the severity and dynamics of the disease as well as the state of development of the baby.	1.3962206069105587
When the pregnancy is continued defined guidelines for its termination for maternal or fetal indications must be taken into consideration.	0.7500933726610213
After delivery, the mother must be intensively monitored for at least 24 to 48 hours (postpartal eclampsia/HELLP syndrome).	0.8896888479396398
The risk for recurrence of the preeclampsia is between 20 and 26 % or when it occurred in the second trimester up to 65 % while that of HELLP syndrome is between 3.5 and 24 %.	1.2915085287323758
Acanthosis nigricans is a hyperkeratotic mucocutaneous eruption of heterogenous etiology which is characterized by hyperpigmentation, velvety cutaneous thickening, intensified skin markings and development of verrucous excrescences typically involving the intertriginous areas.	0.8157199326439512
Malignant acanthosis nigricans is most often associated with an abdominal adenocarcinoma frequently unresectable at the time of diagnosis.	1.0591309589610844
We report on the rare association of acanthosis nigricans with a transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder.	0.9489060243415876
Symptomatic treatment with topical calcipotriol significantly reduced the hyperkeratotic and papillomatous skin changes.	0.8202927172998556
The goal of this evaluation study is to analyze the effects of a new gerontopsychiatric institution, the gerontopsychiatric center (GC: a combination of a home-based outpatient service, a day-hospital and a consulting office for elderly with mental disorders) on the reorganization process of the treatment system from intramural toward extramural structures, as experts of the government of the FRG have been demanding for a long time.	1.2219421988166477
Based on data of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies two regional catchment areas - the city of Bielefeld (without GC, control region) and the district of G√ºtersloh (with GC) - are compared and analyzed, whether changes within the gerontopsychiatric system (subsystem A), the system of general medical treatment (subsystem B), or within the elderly care system (subsystem C) occurred.	1.3216982377572382
Concerning subsystem A the results are that the GC has a strong impact on the intended shift from intra- to extramural structures, without selecting patients by diagnosis nor by severity degrees of their mental disorders in extramural treatment facilities.	1.08573043944125
The home-based outpatient treatment is especially successful for elderly with a functional psychic disorder.	0.9157157403618804
These patients had the highest scores in improvement of psychiatric symptoms as well as in reduction of their self-care deficits within one year Effects of the GC on subsystem B were evident soon after its establishment, for example, by the increasing cooperation between the gerontopsychiatric health services and general hospitals in the region with GC, in which (hospitals) two fifths of all clinical gerontopsychiatric patients with a mental disorder as the main diagnosis (ICD-9) are treated.	1.3009597960794923
An effect of the GC on subsystem C is possibly the fact that in its region the rate of direct transfers of patients from the clinical gerontopsychiatric department into homes for the elderly is significantly lower than in the region without GC.	1.1046814389408324
In the field of psychoneuroimmunology it has become obvious that the immune system is governed by multiple influences from the central nervous system.	0.9240201115976495
One approach to verify these interactions can be seen in stress research.	0.9123375766431181
While the phenomenon of stress-induced changes in immunological processes is widely accepted, more recent studies focus on possible moderators and mechanisms of these responses.	0.9703069442325143
Within this research strategy it became evident that catecholamine increases upon stress are of a major importance for the frequently observed mild leukocytosis.	0.9622848821132403
The present study was conducted to investigate whether the often observed stress-induced increases in the number of peripheral lymphocyte subsets depends on the amount of epinephrine or norepinephrine release.	1.0734685805728421
Moreover, the question was addressed whether high or low catecholamine release is related to subjective ratings on discomfort.	0.9685128840458307
Using a "public speaking paradigm" we were able to replicate previous findings of high increases in the absolute number of CD8+ and CD56+ cells in peripheral blood.	0.9021383085945817
Moreover, when dividing subjects into high and low catecholamine responders, the amount of change was significantly larger in catecholamine responders irrespective of whether norepinephrine or epinephrine was used for grouping the subjects.	1.0618099915803156
However, high and low catecholamine responders did not differ with respect to subjective ratings on discomfort.	1.1696498370184996
The data are discussed with respect to underlying mechanisms in catecholamine-induced lymphocyte migration and possible reasons for the mismatch between objective and subjective indicators of stressor efficacy.	0.881408851678755
We report a locally recurrent retiform haemangioendothelioma (RHE) on the right great toe in a 40-year-old woman.	1.1582993889789472
There was a secondary soft tissue lesion on her right lower leg.	0.991584982647306

Long, arborizing, neoplastic blood vessels were lined by CD31 and factor VIII-positive, monomorphic endothelial tumour cells; focally solid tumour areas, papillae and a prominent inflammatory infiltrate consisting of mature B and T lymphocytes were noted.	0.8446735440789035
The concept and the group of low-grade malignant vascular neoplasms is discussed, with special emphasis on inclusion of RHE in this category.	1.0894843889142407
HMSN is a hereditary symmetric ascending neuropathy of the peripherial nerves.	0.7597888270703604
Several cases of HMSN with motility disorders of both eyes have been reported in the literature.	0.7945593847600916
We describe a patient with HMSN type 1 and an incomplete peripherial 3rd nerve palsy of the right eye.	1.1096767194253252
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of developed unilateral oculomotor disorder in a patient with HMSN.	0.8259883996149524
A 34-year-old male (190 cm/100 kg) was scheduled for surgery of the nasal septum.	1.1879825294329591
He had had uneventful anaesthesia for appendicectomy 14 years earlier: following 600 mg thiopentone, 180 mg suxamethonium and up to 2 vol.% halothane for 20 min had been used and no symptoms of malignant hyperthermia (MH) were recorded.	0.9961293920669001
Following oral premedication with 2 mg flunitrazepam at 7.00 a.m. anaesthesia was induced with a priming dose of atracurium at 8.45 a.m. followed by 0.2 mg fentanyl, 500 mg thiopentone, and 100 mg suxamethonium.	1.0973139614360294
Endotracheal intubation was accomplished easily [9], and the patient was ventilated manually in a semi-closed circle system until spontaneous ventilation resumed.	0.9891674252257191
Enflurane (1.5% for 5 min, 1.0% for 10 min, and 0.8% until the diagnosis of MH was suspected) was given in 33% O2/66% N2O.	1.444827230393898
Seventy minutes after induction it was noted that the spontaneous respiratory rate and minute volume had risen continuously from 10/min and 6 l/min, respectively, to 20/min and 12 l/min.	1.084375080622077
Attempts at deepening anaesthesia with repeated doses of fentanyl up to a total dose of 0.95 mg failed to reduce the hyperventilation.	0.9404176185384955
In spite of a high fresh gas flow of 6 l/min and assisted manual ventilation, the FIO2 started to fall from 0.34 to 0.28 at 10:20 a.m.	1.0903245292963222
The O2/N2O ratio was changed to 1 : 1, but the FIO2 remained at 0.3.	1.2129317065716696
MH was suspected, enflurane was discontinued, and an arterial blood gas analysis was done (Table 2).	1.2035881096823757
When marked acidosis and hypercarbia were found, dantrolene 2.5 mg/kg was given, the operation was terminated, and the patient's trachea was extubated and he was monitored closely in the intensive care unit for 24 h. Vital signs were stable (Table 3) and no further complications were observed.	1.1695764678492782
The patient did not mention pain or uneasiness postoperatively.	0.6089652170897913
About 6 months later, a muscle biopsy was done according to the European MH Protocol [5] and the patient was found to be MHEh.	1.169748462857183
In this case five main reasons for the hypercarbia and mixed acidosis must be considered (Table 1).	0.9938405447359524
Firstly, hypoventilation does not seem to be reasonable as the patient was ventilated with 8 to 12 l/min, which is within the range of 80 - 120 mg/kg - min.	1.3436707497910318
Secondly, we can exclude shock and hypoperfusion because the patient had a normal blood pressure and heart rate (within 65 - 90 beats/min), his fingertips and skin were well perfused, his body temperature was 37  ¬∞C, and there was no sign of muscle rigidity.	1.1845801855676787
Thirdly, a defect of the CO2 adsorber as well as CO2 admixture to the N2O and O2 ventilation gases can cause hypercarbia.	0.999520348359392
We use two absorbers in sequence of which one is changed every day, and found neither a change in colour of the indicator nor an abnormally raised temperature of the absorbers [11].	0.9394497492815793
A postoperative check of the ventilator showed no defect in the O2/N2O supply and a correctly functioning anaesthesia apparatus.	0.8927223305264843
A malfunction of both CO2 absorbers resulting in intraoperative hypercarbia could not explain a postoperative mixed acidosis lasting for more than 6 h. Anaesthesias performed at the same time using soda lime from the same canisters were totally uneventful.	1.047818419128114
It is concluded that the hypercarbia and mixed acidosis were caused by hypermetabolism.	0.7533539158919151
A thorough postoperative examination by an internist did not reveal any thyroid, pulmonary, endocrine, or circulatory reason for our intra- and postoperative findings.	1.1861587987757043
Iatrogenic factors like superficial anaesthesia or systemic side effects of adrenaline admixture to local anaesthetics can cause hypermetabolism without striking clinical signs, but they do not cause mixed acidosis lasting longer than 6 h (Table 2).	0.9699362742111203
The most suitable explanation in this case is an abortive form of MH.	1.1517793391841984
