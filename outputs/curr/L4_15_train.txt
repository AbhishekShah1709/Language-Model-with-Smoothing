Clinical improvement of the cutaneous manifestations is noted in most cases and usually occurs during the first year of life.	0.7651609428422235
We present a patient with CMTC with a band-like pattern following the L3 dermatome.	0.5759224096275022
At the age of 13 years, the skin manifestations worsened, with ulcerations and intermittent claudication.	0.7128980707783232
Angiographic imaging revealed stenosis of the deep femoral artery, and the circumflex femoral artery and the first perforating arteries were not visualized.	0.7178511241214774

Introduction: The efficacy of vascular surgery in the treatment of popliteal arterial aneurysms (PAA) and the justification of conservative therapy was investigated in the present study.	0.8190587697300921
Materials and methods: From January 1985 to December 1996, 87 patients were operated on for PAA.	0.611763898873299
The clinical records were reviewed retrospectively and patients were categorized concerning PAA-related symptoms, vascular run-off, and material used for vascular reconstruction.	0.6048782690338655
Patients were examined, and the patency of the vascular reconstruction was checked by palpation and Doppler sonography.	0.7911889879778908
Results: The cumulative survival calculated using the Kaplan-Meier curve was 70% after 10 years.	0.7003427618567447
Asymptomatic patients had the best results and patients with acute ischemia, the worst.	0.9392875580583308
The outcome concerning patent vs. occluded run-off and autologous vs. heterologous bypass material was similar.	0.414381484524184
Conclusion: Asymptomatic and uncomplicated PAA should be treated surgically.	0.45013386090332913
Only PAA with a diameter less than 2 cm, and without thrombus on the vessel walls can be treated conservatively.	0.7246167108752359
Collodion baby is a clinical description for a transient condition of the newborn which is caused by various disorders of cornification.	0.5777486048183195
The majority of cases are due to autosomal recessive lamellar ichthyosis.	0.5054115309388237
In up to 10% of cases "self-healing" of the skin occurs.	1.0685799462605052
We report about a mature male baby who at birth was covered entirely with a shining, collodion-like membrane.	0.41255240200359133
There also were marked ectropion of the eyelids and eversion of the lips.	0.4020291119813861
After shedding of the membrane almost complete clearing of the skin occurred until the age of three months.	0.5821690543222587
In the case reported here skin biopsies taken on the 20th day of life showed discrete and non-specific ultrastructural changes, with no features of lamellar ichthyosis or other cornification disorders.	0.6428807482911423
Past research on the phenomenon of enhanced pain sensitivity in fibromyalgia syndome (FS) revealed evidence for both a higher pain magnitude in response to nociceptive stimuli (hyperalgesia) and a general perceptual amplification of sensations (hypervigilance).	0.579210394024578
In order to distinguish between these two aspects of disturbed sensory processing in FS, cerebral evoked potentials after brief painful laser and auditory stimuli were measured in 10 FS patients.	0.5095823139770634
Results were compared with those from age-matched painfree controls.	0.6339975732404061
Amplitudes of middle-latency (N1) and long-latency (P2) laser evoked potentials (LEPs) were significantly higher in FS than in controls.	0.6405975397006204
Furthermore, laser intensity at pain but not at sensation threshold was lower in FS than in controls.	0.4132364888676083
However, auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) did not differ between groups.	0.5446875688832887
Enhanced N1 and P2 amplitudes of LEPs suggest stronger sensory and attentional processing of nociceptive information in FS, respectively.	0.312209162494373
The concept of hypervigilance is challenged by the failure to find differences in auditory perception among FS and control patients.	0.43497294626384175
Yet, the importance of unpleasant intensities of auditory stimulation, not applied in this study, to reveal abnormal non-nociceptive perceptual amplification in FS is discussed.	0.6277157025950318
In a prospective study, 53 fractures of the distal fifth of the tibia were stabilized by unreamed nailing.	0.7276518949375406
Additional involvement of the ankle joint occurred in 18 patients.	0.6555066446089081
50 patients returned for follow-up.	0.3241237137986129
In 30 patients tibia and fibula were fractured at the same (distal) level; in 20 patients the fracture of the fibula was located more proximally.	0.684957424345275
In 12 patients the fractures extended into the tibial pilon.	0.5438692724083809
Severe soft tissue damage was seen in 24 fractures (18 open, 6 closed).	0.7262690076167484
Ninety percent of all fractures healed uneventfully without further surgical intervention after unreamed nailing.	0.48534269019894005
In two patients the unreamed nail had to be exchanged for a reamed tibial nail.	0.49818716936142166
Bone grafting and secondary dynamization of the nail by removal of a proximal interlocking bolt were performed in one case each.	0.748982855162772
Thirty-one fractures healed in anatomical position.	0.4109582636683698
Valgus or varus angulation of less than 5  ° occurred in 18 patients.	0.5520073969707239
One fracture healed with rotatory angulation of 15  °.	0.3430952861271164
The highest rate of complications (22 %) was seen in patients with distal fractures of the fibula without additional plating (of the fibula).	0.8321093576738716
There was no deep infection.	0.498357122919999
Tibial fractures close to the ankle joint can be managed by unreamed nailing.	0.7087070297517509
Distal fractures of the fibula should be stabilized by additional plating.	0.6361107078203284
Because of the unreamed technique of implantation this procedure can also be used in grade II or III open fractures.	0.6892220976961279
Complex mechanisms have evolved in mammalian cells for regulating cellular lifespan.	0.317048508955053
Normal cells demonstrate a strictly limited growth potential and senescence after a defined number of cell divisions.	0.37144619801774764
In contrast, tumor cells often exhibit an apparently unlimited proliferation potential and are termed immortalized.	0.47660396064697774
It has been proposed that the progressive shortening of the tips of the eukaryotic chromosomes - the telomeres - is an important component of senescence and is involved in the control of cell cycle.	0.8545002520155243
The enzyme telomerase adds TTAGGG repeats onto mammalian telomeres, preventing their shortening.	0.3585235698424869
Telomerase is normally inactive in most somatic cells, but detectable in tumor cells.	0.5306718183704032
The activation of telomerase in malignant cancers seems to be an important step in tumorigenesis in order to gain the ability of indefinite proliferation and to become immortal.	0.6337709267918039
This review describes the present knowledge of telomeres and telomerase and their role in cellular senescence and human aging.	0.429346893633492
It summarizes aspects of telomerase in cancer and its function as a diagnostic and prognostic tumor marker.	0.6002408250253793
PCR-based diagnosis of infectious diseases has developed into an important method in surgical pathology.	0.4728400306400752
We summarize our experience in this area based on 3500 analyses performed during the past 5 years.	0.6983089222997141
The peculiarity of material from a pathological laboratory is the risk of DNA fragmentation as a consequence of tissue fixation.	0.5047800022924287
For this reason the assays used must be adapted to this particular situation.	0.5574815941457278
PCR-based diagnosis of infectious diseases, if performed according to appropriate quality standards, is a safe and effective technique with high sensitivity and specificity and results in an etiologically based diagnosis.	0.7594179078721511
The shift of age distribution within the population of industrialized societies has led to an increased need of treating diseases in elderly patients and at the same time in a higher number of patients bearing an increased operative risk.	0.6486555582737189
Today, the development of surgical techniques and intensive care treatment enables us to carry out numerous procedures in geriatric patients.	0.6721314466720212
Innovative surgical techniques like minimal invasive surgery with minor trauma due to the surgical approach changed patient's categories, also.	0.6437847766473653
Taken together with other procedures causing less operative stress indications for patients who were not operable previously have changed.	0.5491256881786941
New developments such as organ transplantation and immunosuppression also generated totally new groups of patients with very distinct conditions for the operative procedure.	0.549696107751182
Vanishing indications or selection of patients as in peptic ulcer disease changed the surgical approach completely: Negative selection has shifted elective operative interventions in ulcer disease to emergency procedures.	0.4928289771979051
Contrasting experiences made in most other countries and especially in the third world, in Germany economic restrictions have not been encountered as of yet.	0.7480028027310782
Economical conditions, an increase in surgical procedures in elderly patients and advances in medical science will continue to change the surgical patient's characteristics profoundly.	0.6973548707418882
From the physicians viewpoint we have to actively participate in this development by personal interaction with the patient, by interdisciplinary cooperation and prompt social and political action.	0.610613332811717
Osteoid osteomas are tumors with intense clinical symptoms and extensive reactive bone changes far exceeding the volume of the lesion itself.	0.5812739611473305
Because of their small size they can be approached by minimally invasive surgical procedures.	0.5117526037465173
We treated ten symptomatic patients with osteoid osteomas (n 6 hip point, n 1 iliac bone, n 1 femoral diaphysis, n2 tibial diaphysis) by excision of the nidus with a 3-mm Harlow-Wood needle using a percutaneous CT-guided approach.	0.6612080711281533
Seven patients with residual tumor were treated with either thermocautery (n 2) or sclerosis with 1 ml of 96% ethanol (n 5).	0.918939031497221
Six patients had instant and constant relief (3 years' observation) of their pain.	0.7695334236961956
In two patients a second transcutaneous intervention was successful.	0.5912954104184341
Only two patients needed open resection.	0.5179515261283171
Compared with the invasive open resection of the tumors, sometimes even putting the stability of the femoral neck at risk, transcutaneous CT-guided enucleation of the nidus of the osteoid osteoma with additional sclerotherapy is a good alternative method, especially in the region of the femoral neck.	0.7406253435003622
We live in an epoch that could be designated as the post-Gutenberg-era.	0.38525281984039833
Writing is no longer the dominant sign system.	0.5028344924243034
It is replaced by electronic signs.	0.23734599045036317
We consider approximately the year 1950 as the turning-point between these two epochs, because by then, in the years after the 2nd World War the American households were saturated with televisions.	0.6356333619519976
Thereby, the new sign system asserted itself.	0.5968086007673387
The topic of this article is the transformation of our sign system and thereby of our worlds of symbols, the leap from the world of written signs into the world of electronic signs, and the possibility born out of it to create electronic objects, which I prefer to call virtual objects.	0.6496760166401974
The manipulation of object-choice and object-relationships accompanying this change and the role assigned to analysts in this new world will be considered as well.	0.44731918583752317
These electronic signs developed quickly a life of their own.	0.3779123873019162
A totally new class of objects came into being, the class of virtual objects.	0.47942645341426826
These are electronically transformed, completed or wholly electronically produced objects.	0.292949888558001
This procedure is accompanied by an industrialization of object-choice and object-relationships.	0.4850813411232785
The manipulated object-choice and object-relationship is born and, moreover, a displacement of natural objects through virtual ones.	0.4691076904034643
A change of the socio-cultural understanding is also a consequence of this process.	0.6064167006883608
New patterns of socio-cultural understanding develop, that could be described as industrial feudalism.	0.5558662922498588
The goal of this article is to describe the transformation of our world of signs and the connected industrialization of object relationships, and to interprete them according to our present possibilities.	0.6949358139694902
In this article 34 randomized controlled trials examining peripherally mediated opioid effects after knee surgery are discussed.	0.503017398455844
All studies examined small doses of morphine injected intraarticularly at the end of knee surgery, but not all studies did show an analgesic effect of the peripheral opioid.	0.6948830683935759
Because of differing study designs a meta-analysis of the data is not possible.	0.6190665404018614
Dysplastic epithelia represent potentially precancerous conditions in which the risk of progression to cancer is unknown in the individual case.	0.5869159123297178
The positive predictive value of mild and moderate dysplasias of the uterine cervix is only about 13%.	0.438772540745895
Using DNA image cytometry on restained, conventional Pap-smears the cytometric equivalent of chromosomal aneuploidy can be detected as marker for neoplastic transformation of cells.	0.4070391393888908
The identification of DNA aneuploidy in dysplastic squamous epithelia can increase the predictive value for malignant transformation to over 90%.	0.5264427992446509
DNA aneuploidy qualifies squamous intraepithelial lesions as high grade (H-SIL) which have to be treated whereas lack of DNA aneuploidy characterizes low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (L-SIL) which have only to be controlled.	0.7056143356142861
The methodology is meanwhile internationally standardized concerning performance and diagnostic interpretation.	0.3025161233490588
In this brief article I attempt to sketch a few salient insights from my career as a researcher and practitioner of psychotherapy: The key to successful therapy is undoubtedly the therapist's empathic listening, coupled with a series of other positive attributes and finely honed interpersonal skills.	0.4202331324969749
On the debit side, patients' hostility frequently evokes counterhostility from the therapist which not infrequently results in a negative outcome.	0.5533675446642318
Percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy is a procedure for inserting a tracheal cannula without a large incision, without extensive dissection of pretracheal tissue, and without exposure of the trachea.	0.6073328418395513
The early complications of the technique are usually minor and late complications are rare.	0.7323974651113407
Although it is a simple procedure, it is not a minor operation.	1.0748992612008224
Users must be familiar with the technique, the indications and contra-indications for the procedure, as well as the complications.	0.6695559409236946
Proper training of the operation and knowledge of the procedure will avoid unnecessary complications.	0.7377750939703105
Percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy is a relatively new technique for inserting a cannula in the tracheal lumen.	0.5499512575627112
It can be done at the patients bedside with only minimal complications.	0.5024833054774404
A short history, the indications and contraindications, the early and late complications of the technique, and comparisons with other techniques as well as with conventional open tracheotomy are reviewed.	0.7924532451977035
In this study, a histologic and histomorphometric analysis of delayed and immediate-placed implants was performed.	0.5241784884116454
An implantation of 16 self-cutting conical titanium screw implants was carried out in 8 beagle dogs.	0.462428317352122
Of these implants, 8 were placed immediately after extraction of the second premolar and 8 implants were placed after 6 months of healing after extraction.	0.6610246412172817
For dynamic histomorphometry, fluorochrome bone markers were injected at two different times prior to euthanasia.	0.3052957535641549
The specimens were examined macroscopically and microscopically 8 months after implantation.	0.5365740301187234
A histologic, dynamic, and static histomorphometry was performed with the aid of different computer programs.	0.7161058504487776
A mean surface of osseointegration of 75.7% and a mean soft tissue implant contact surface of 24.2% was seen in immediate-placed implants.	0.6968691751398749
For delayed implantation, an osseointegrated surface of 80.7% and a soft tissue covering of 19.3% was examined.	0.8141822049752571
The fibrogenic structures in the cervical implant part were more dense and there were more adhesive epithelial elements (hemidesmosomes) around delayed implants.	0.45777957985231066
The result of the dynamic and static histomorphometry showed no significant differences in the two groups (P < 0.1).	0.8430727969876166
In conclusion, it can be stated that a new steady-state of the soft and hard tissue around dental implants was seen 8 months after implant insertion in both groups.	0.6487594882098385
There was a pseudoankylotic healing in the osseous part.	0.49474528065567674
The lower level of osseointegration in immediate-placed implants was caused by early resorption of bone in the crestal part.	0.41030978383868216
Thus, a larger part of the implant was surrounded by soft tissue and a long epithelial attachment resulted.	0.6928367235604382
Polydactyly may be preaxial or tibial (halluxside), postaxial or ulnar (side of the little toe) and central (middle toes).	0.452708963643645
The duplication may appear at the distal and medial phalanges or at the whole digit.	0.48674211842995085
The metatarsal bone may be partwise or completely duplicated, the accessory toes may share only one metatarsal.	0.386177258787401
Surgical intervention may be indicated in shoeproblems, for esthetic reasons or, especially in duplication of the metatarsales, because of secondary deviation of the toes and therefore shoeproblems or plantar callosities.	0.642697415707151
Preoperative analysis including x-ray is of great importance to achieve good functional and cosmetic results.	0.6332615977411122
Across centers, transfusion can vary eightfold for the same mediastinal drainage after adult cardiac operations.	0.3580172516567348
Excessive blood drainage resulting in increased transfusions occurs in 29 % of patients.	0.5361984586414053
Various strategies have been proposed to decrease bleeding and allogenic transfusion requirements in the perioperative period of heart surgery.	0.5782373938497023
Blood conservation methods were reviewed critically.	0.24702548916495504
Avoidance of preoperative anemia, tolerance of low hemoglobin concentrations, the use of autologous blood, and adherence to a strict transfusion protocol will reduce the use of allogenic transfusions.	0.627108469570072
Perioperatively, maintenance of normothermia contributes to improved hemostasis.	0.2727534602387037
Injections with botulinum toxin type A (BTX) are considered the first-line treatment for spasmodic torticollis (ST), blepharospasm (BL) and hemifacial spasm (HFS).	0.557810414174682
Because BTX brings only temporary and partial relief, patients frequently try other additional therapies to minimize their symptoms.	0.4330058616435825
The subjective rating of all therapies ever tried by patients with ST, BL and HFS was evaluated by using a simple questionnaire.	0.5352297165553256
Two hundred questionnaires were considered (112 TS, 54 BL, 34 HFS).	0.517395412650005
BTX was rated subjectively the best therapy in all three diagnostic groups (median: 2=good effect).	0.5700539701199601
Despite Citalopram and physiotherapy (median: 3=average effect), all other therapies were rated with a median of >=4 (=minimal effect).	0.6102180605097685
Patients with ST tried 7.7, patients with BL 2.4 and patients with HFS 2.6 different types of therapy.	0.8189462920272826
In conclusion, BTX is the most effective treatment for patients with ST, BL and HFS, as rated subjectively.	0.630838737022792
Further evaluation of therapies additional to BTX injections is recommended.	0.31531707811652004
The perioperative morbidity and mortality is mainly influenced by the type and duration of surgery as well as the patient's preoperative state of health.	0.839497680328836
Anesthesia per se, however, may also result in severe perioperative (patho)physiological changes, which may be both desired (e.g.	0.5974341581659547
analgesia, vasodilation in vascular surgery) or detrimental (e.g.	0.4472662301948274
hypothermia, ventilatory depression) and which may differ depending on the anesthetic technique used (e.g.	0.49127639114559624
general anesthesia vs. regional anesthesia).	0.377607803218886
Yet, all anesthestic techniques have in common, that their effects are not limited to the duration of the surgical intervention, but may expand far into the postoperative period.	0.8875666854081553
Therefore, many trials have been performed in the past aiming to compare the impact of different anesthetic techniques on the incidence of postoperative techniques, no significant advantage of one or the other technique has been identified up to now with respect to postoperative mortality or severe morbidity.	0.8213691447126502
This finding may be due to at least three factors.	0.4916612550681196
1) Many side-effects related to anesthesia - due to close postoperative monitoring - are detected and treated early in the postoperative phase (e.g.	0.6800359362521073
in the recovery room), thereby preventing serious complications.	0.5205667518229602
2) Postoperative mortality related exclusively to anesthesia probably is so low, that huge patient numbers would be required to demonstrate any significant differences between different techniques.	0.6108229357964813
3) Besides the factor 'anesthesia', may other factors contribute to the anesthesia related morbidity and mortality (e.g.	0.5517853819933978
the factor 'anesthetist') which are hardly quantified.	0.7413207559164564
The fact that clear advantages for a single technique have not yet been demonstrated must not, however, result in anesthetic 'nihilism'.	0.4897551140292905
Rather there may be good reasons in the individual patient (e.g.	0.5664188950556569
lack of a recovery room), to prefer a certain anesthetic technique or drug over another, in order to lower the individual risk of anesthesia.	0.5955350998883594
Whether the use of a certain technique - e.g.	0.6212942907709439
spinal or epidural anesthesia - may contribute to a reduction of specific postoperative surgical complications (e.g.	0.5864993138812704
rate of reocclusion subsequent to peripheral vascular surgery) is presently under investigation.	0.5399540695235892
This paper first describes how the project study on the regulation and monitoring of medical treatment arose.	0.5766073704211796
We then introduce its objectives, the members of the study group, the composition of the collective and selection of cases, and the methods used for ascertainment and recording of data.	0.7884996111034762

Nissen was a critical observant clinician, an efficient and popular physician, a teacher and a speaker.	0.5721575214351247
Of historical significance are pioneering works in thoracic surgery, the first successful pneumectomy in man, the classical works about the treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and hiatus hernia.	0.6180951999483703
The Nissen-Rossetti type of fundoplication has remained the standard procedure in Europe and the USA.	0.53254656423097
This study describes the approach that is necessary in outpatient surgery in order to carry out the operation safely.	0.5650263440972921
The particular procedure is discussed, and the necessity of strict postoperative management is shown.	0.669177140070159
Between 1994 and 1997, the author supervised 4588 outpatient operations, of which 3020 were arthroscopic.	0.6375131491635717
The observed complications are listed and evaluated.	0.31385255096520615
Overall, outpatient surgery is well accepted by the patients.	0.782975817263028
The criteria for denying a patient surgery on an outpatient basis are laid out.	0.4701649579714232
The Schering Atlas is a teaching file in CT and MRI anatomy designed for physicians and students.	0.43446116924372735
It is available on CD-ROM, shows good image quality, and is easy to use in medium-price-range personal computer systems.	0.6078145287169902
Because of the amount and quality of image material, the Schering Atlas's price is appropriate for institutions, but not for private users.	0.7558124279955571
M. Linehan developed "dialectical behavioral therapy" specifically to treat chronically suicidal borderline patients.	0.3559812355552156
It rests on a biosocial model that assumes a disorder in the regulation of emotions and in tolerance of stress.	0.4088036544581867
The numerous dysfunctional patterns of behavior such as self-destructive behavior, inability to govern impulses or severe dissociative phenomena are regarded as attempts at problem-solving.	0.32222930822981904
This concept of therapy focuses on the continuing balance between the necessity of accepting maladaptive behavior patterns in both an intrapsychic and an interactional context while still working to change them.	0.431573384490968
A comprehensive manual outlines the clearly structured therapy and integrates a wide choice of therapeutic strategies.	0.362688811915714
Parallel to development of the therapy itself, a method also was developed for testing therapist adherence to the manual's guidelines, thus providing a basis for empirical evaluation.	0.6630101495731809
An initial controlled, randomized study demonstrated the significant superiority of this method to methods of unspecific psychotherapy at various levels.	0.5957175873725723
In the current endeavor to develop disorder-specific approaches to the treatment of personality disorders, "dialectical behavioral therapy" is a noteworthy model.	0.7620288609122067
Complications associated with the application of a halo device are not infrequent; however, osteomyelitis of the skull with a consecutive subdural abscess is a rare but severe complication.	0.7132964102313704
We present the case of a patient with a subdural abscess as a result of a local pin-track infection of the halo device, in whom pathological behavior was the primary clinical finding.	0.8038511625362055
The possible complications associated with the halo device are discussed with emphasis on associated head injuries and preexisting neurological diseases, as well as indications for the halo, clinical symptoms of pin-track infections, necessary diagnostic measurements and the appropriate treatment.	0.716026957543877
The attempt was made to explain dysfunctions of the motor system - analogical to electronic data processing systems - as a speciality of the regulation part of the motor system.	0.6208516132285676
Thereby dysfunctions can be seen as misplaced variables in the regulation software with not defined or unknown values of afferences or combination of afferences.	0.5098807004220748
This leads to a failure of the corresponding software modul that results in the loss of function which is regulated through this modul.	0.6676474151267292
Especially with changing of afference through manual treatment or through needling, a replacement of the variables can be reached and this leads to normal function.	0.5491172862792243
With this hypothesis all phenomens of dysfunctions can be explained.	0.39109383061839204
Empirical data on costs of care for chronically mentally ill patients in Germany are rare.	0.5111879334224223
There is a lack of cross-sectional studies as well as of any analysis of the long-term course of mental health care costs.	0.7124107328931525
This study combines data from two cost-studies on patients with schizophrenia, conducted in the same catchment area at an interval of 15 years, to draw conclusions about the long-term course of these costs.	0.6641462691960685
The direct costs of comprehensive community based mental health care had increased by 77.0% during 15 years, while the costs of a permanents stay in a long-term ward of a psychiatric hospital had increased by 78.5% in the same period.	0.6910285692677932
This increase was 27 and 28.5 per cent higher than the general rise in cost of living in Germany during the interval between the two studies.	0.6607490667878465
This higher-than-average increase in mental health care costs was accompanied by a much higher cost-effectiveness.	0.5229293512124578
Thus, this rise of costs must be seen as a consequence of the great deficits and the resulting basic improvement of care for chronically mentally ill patients in Germany, which was demanded by an expert-commission of the government in the mid-seventies.	0.7381006701529342
Background: The usefulness of Holter monitoring to detect rarely occuring symptoms seems to be limited.	0.5237817727921287
In adults the event recorder has already been a precise diagnostic tool in evaluating palpitations and syncopes.	0.5049932759334783
There have been few reports of the implementation of cardiac monitoring with an event recorder in children.	0.4983417702687023
The immunomodulating effect of primary surgical intervention was investigated in 33 patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, pharynx and larynx.	0.5646277463385492
An operation time longer than 7 h was significantly associated with a decrease in lymphocytes, CD4+ T-lymphocytes and CD8+ T-lymphocytes.	0.5632930022875687
The CD4/CD8-ratio as a marker for the down-regulation of the cellular immune response was slightly decreased but was still in the normal range.	0.5953073638612341
CD4-lymphocyte counts increased 7 days after operation while CD8 lymphocytes were found elevated 4 weeks after sugery.	0.45837470668456753
The in vitro stimulation of the lymphocytes was impaired for 1 to 4 weeks.	0.5948462201062731
Interleukins, interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor did not show any changes after surgery.	0.5339393003959697
Decreases of lymphocytes, especially CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, were significantly associated with the time of operation and the volume of blood loss.	0.9305859310449025
Extensive trauma, age, different kinds of anesthesia and intensive care interventions were not associated with specific immunomodulating effects, although these factors might be responsible for suppressing cytokine responses.	0.608942743247788
Both preclinical and clinical evidence support the usefulness of antidepressants in chronic pain treatment.	0.5902060102820251
Monoamine uptake inhibitors influence the neurotransmissions of noradrenaline (NA) and/or serotonin (5-HT); their effect on nociception is thought to take place predominantly within the spinal cord.	0.6063715607974256
Antidepressant drugs seem to differ in their properties as analgesics and as thymoleptics.	0.4423663714960386
The present work is aimed at correlating the special mechanism of action of antidepressants in diminishing nocicepetion with the pharmacological profile of these drugs in clinical pain treatment.	0.5633187818526153
From a preclinical, experimental point of view, it can be expected, that mixed type uptake blockers should be superior to selective NA or 5-HT uptake inhibitors.	0.618522123950846
The analgesic profile of antidepressants was established by a metaanalysis of clinical trials on the effect of these drugs, given alone or in combination with other analgetics, in chronic pain syndromes.	0.8023157741804962
57 Clinical trials were separated into 5 groups according to their scientific quality: [1] placebo-controlled double-blind studies with high power; [2] placebo-controlled double-blind studies with low power; [3-4] open controlled studies or studies with historical controls; [5] case reports.	0.7335954695988436
A study was positive if the tested antidepressant was more effective than placebo or the compared drug or seemed beneficial with respect to the interval of its previous absence.	0.5260977029640439
The most effective antidepressants in chronic pain treatment only included unselective monoamine reuptake inhibitors in the following rank order: amitriptyline > clomipramine >= desipramine >= imipramine >= doxepin.	0.7040838542843292
A statement about the appropriate dosage of these drugs in chronic pain treatment, however, must wait for properly conducted dose finding studies which include the measurement of plasma concentrations.	0.6013457902093052
Intensive care medicine for both surgical and medical patients has a common scientific and clinical basis.	0.6273700309442923
In critically ill patients the medical conditions are complex and can be managed only by specialists thoroughly trained in intensive care medicine.	0.5747932524318493
Therefore, surgeons as well as anesthesiologists must have a detailed theoretical and clinical knowledge of intensive care medicine.	0.5104897011784404
Surgical training places the emphasis on operative skills, while intraoperative management of the patient by the anesthesiologist calls for skills involved in intensive care medicine.	0.617234264800404
Interdisciplinary cooperation between specialists is essential to improve the quality of intensive care medicine further.	0.6916647314064679
The cooperation that already exists between surgeons and anesthesiologists makes closer collaboration in the future a logical step.	0.46384729757470283
In this review article data of retrospective studies on the therapeutic effects of oxygen are summarized and possible indications for this therapy suggested.	0.7189068778936979
Studies in infants with chronic lung disease (CLD) showed that (i) if SaO2 was kept >= 93 % via generous prescription of home oxygen, rates of sudden death were much lower than in studies where this was less generously prescribed, (ii) weight gain was significantly better with O2 therapy than without it, (iii) increasing SaO2 from 82 to 93 % by providing low-flow oxygen resulted in a 50 % reduction of pulmonary artery pressure, (iv) hypoxia could cause a significant increase in airway resistance, and (v) low-flow oxygen reduced the frequency of intermittent falls in SaO2 to < 85 % even in infants who had values of >= 90 % at rest.	0.7743906606817703
These data suggest that oxygen therapy should be considered in CLD infants if baseline SaO2 is < 93 %.	0.6116608534438756
For older infants, particularly with CF, only few data are available.	0.7641781866202323
In these patients oxygen may only be given if SaO2 is < 90 % unless there are clinical symptoms related to hypoxaemia, e. g. pulmonary hypertension.	0.6243001101603785
Regarding the practical aspects of home oxygen therapy, provision of liquid oxygen via nasal cannulae appears to be the method of choice.	0.5937607351734939
Side effects include the risk of CO2 retention, which occurs occasionally in children with CF or sleep-related upper airway obstruction, but has not been reported for infants with CLD.	0.7549317580772674
To identify this potential side effect and to determine the exact amount of oxygen required, performance of a sleep recording of SaO2 and CO2 with and without oxygen is suggested.	0.5012881230839445
In infants with CLD, home monitoring of oxygenation should also be considered.	0.6012554392995298
Fractures of the distal radius represent one of the most common fractures and do have high social-economic relevance.	0.7463181056076639
For treatement they need practicable classification and therapeutic standards.	0.27853497056339704
The demand for stable osteosynthesis of A3-, B2-B3 and C1-C2-fractures is connected to dorsal or volar internal fixation with plate and practical autogenous cancellous bone grafting, even for the elder patient.	0.4818435811813089
The isolated external fixation with K-wires represent special situation.	0.4317808198048379
Supply of implants and biodegradable materials will support this development.	0.30377111161314957
Introduction: Pheochromocytoma during pregnancy is rare and represents a high risk for mother and fetus.	0.6336650985461156
Due to the variable clinical presentation it may be mistaken for preeclampsia.	0.5491504734827063
Case: A 34-year-old primiapara with hypertension up to 240/120 mmHg.	0.4475486728446995
After diagnosis of a pheochromocytoma its resection together with lymph node metastasis in the 17th week of gestation was performed.	0.5729912839615836
Conclusion: The definitive diagnosis is confirmed by elevation of serum catecholamines and their metabolites in a 24-h urine collection.	0.6030729165066685
Localization during pregnancy can be made by ultrasound and MRI.	0.6769490844617653
The definitive treatment is surgical removal after administration of adrenergic blockers.	0.4022726472067881
If discovered later in pregnancy, delivery by elective caesarean section followed by tumor resection is recommended.	0.3547617606224585
Since about 10 % of pheochromocytomas are malignant, postpartum screening is required to detect and treat extraadrenal or metastatic tumors by MIBG scintigraphy, chemotherapy or surgical procedures.	0.6050219902832694
Ionizing radiation from natural or man-made sources may affect human health.	0.29084155168159065
The main consequence of low and moderate radiation doses is the induction of cancer.	0.4249474296479195
To quantify these effects both epidemiological studies and experimental radiobiological research are needed.	0.3370420857977238
The ensuing results of the studies are used to establish radiation protection principles and dose limits to protect the public from the effects of ionizing radiation.	0.6053435872766294
Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is associated with premature atherosclerosis and early cardiovascular death if untreated.	0.36109712195731375
In an asymptomatic 13-year-old girl we discovered an extensive hypoplasia of the abdominal aorta and the Aa.	0.631270244520306
iliacae, a combination which so far has not been described, that has not been reported before.	0.8540325367957302
The vascular hypoplasia was asymptomatic.	0.2299747121473553
Angiography additionally showed severe atherosclerosis of the Aa.	0.2596087977054143
After 13 months of low-density-lipoprotein(LDL)-apheresis angiographically there was no pregression, but even slight improvement of vascular the disease.	0.688940847802985
Discussion: Since severe atheromatous changes of systemic arteries may be missed by clinical examination, we strongly recommend complete imaging of all major systemic arteries in children with homozygous familial hypercholesterinemia.	0.5870620612945593
LDL-apheresis is the treatment of choice in these patients.	0.6546613555537687
Since 1993 almost 400 patients with port wine stains have been treated with the flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser.	0.4985350097413315
The therapeutic effect on 61 adult patients was evaluated.	0.49536814826345826
After a mean of 2.16 treatments the colour lightened by between 33% and 100% in 70% of these patients.	0.98684449164796
The best results were obtained in patients with plain pink port wine stains.	0.650542398983844
In this kind of port wine stains the argon laser has proved to be far less successful.	0.41331992002613704
The rate of adverse effects amounted to only 5%.	0.5453756419686565
The results are expected to be improved by further laser sessions.	0.8129954782308745
The flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser is an important advance in the treatment of port wine stains.	0.4476505423015976
Most craniofacial malformations result from a premature fusion of skull sutures.	0.39216822807938384
Depending on the scope of the sutures affected, the results are more or less distinct deformations of the facial and cranial skull with substantial negative effects on functional as well as esthetic aspects.	0.6677191772657284
The etiopathology is still unclear.	0.22336130637527649
Various therapies have been developed over the past 100 years.	0.6045916485261947
However, Tessier's technique of fronto-orbital advancement has been an important milestone in the treatment of these malformations.	0.6174835764684686
Numerous adjustments have since perfected this operational technique.	0.17706232871990216
It is now possible to treat practically all skull malformations with the surgical techniques available today.	0.5198392309302047
At the same time, these techniques have also aided the advancements in tumor surgery and traumatology.	0.6101356794721466
Injuries of the flexor tendon are usually open injuries.	0.48201939516052955
In most cases primary treatment is therefore seldom performed by orthopaedic surgeons.	0.4524813819925996
This is different for injuries of the extensor tendon.	0.35235706863904875
Three quarters of injuries of the extensor tendon are closed injuries.	0.40502879883794485
Therefore we do go into primary and secondary reconstruction of the flexor tendon, but focus on primary and secondary reconstruction of the extensor tendon in the most common zones (1, Th I, 3, Th III).	0.7716437790620243
The Shouldice operation has evolved to become the classic procedure for open pure tissue repair for inguinal hernias.	0.4176188557517939
The operation is an important part of a surgeon's repertoire as he may need to perform the procedure at some critical time, especially when faced with strangulation, when tension-free prosthetic repairs and laparoscopic approaches fail.	0.6647377866333637
When properly done, the Shouldice repair yields results that have set standards for all other techniques to emulate.	0.4932462172244527
Other particular advantages of the technique are: safety, the use of local anaesthesia, benign postoperative complications and the cost, which is the most reasonable of all surgical techniques.	0.8704662150996287
Acute occlusive mesenteric ischemia is caused by a local impairment of splanchnic blood flow and poses a particular surgical challenge.	0.5261560708092072
Acute superior mesenteric occlusion is a medical/surgical emergency mandating prompt diagnosis (clinical awareness, angiography) and therapy (exploratory laparotomy with possible arterial reconstruction; embolectomy, thrombectomy; and/or bowel resection).	0.5366185392828645
The difficulty of early diagnosis is probably the most important cause of the high mortality which varies from 70 % to 90 % in arterial and functional mesenteric ischemia and from 20 % to 70 % in an acute thrombosis of the mesenteric veins.	0.9792511346397585
Improved survival from nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia is dependent upon the identification of high-risk groups and on aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic measures (intra-arterial infusion of papaverine through the angiographic catheter with or without bowel resection).	0.60860261769868
For assessment of bowel viability, the clinical judgement during first- or second-look exploration is still the most reliable parameter.	0.8227161726482767
The surgical management of chronic mesenteric ischemia includes aortomesenteric grafting and transaortic endarterectomy in the majority of patients with comorbidity of cardiovascular arteriosclerotic diseases and results in a high rate of symptom-free patients.	0.6450196514289039
Prophylactic reconstruction of visceral arteries is indicated only in certain limited circumstances.	0.41097911341159354
Thirty-nine of 63 patients undergoing deep anterior rectal resection received a straight coloanal anastomosis (CAA); the remaining 24 patients additionally had a colon-j-pouch (CPA) constructed.	0.47395574065333324
After pouch-anal anastomosis, local septic complications occurred in 12.5 % of patients compared to 20.5 % after coloanal anastomosis.	0.7897577013116233
Stool frequency after pouch-anal anastomosis was 3.3 per 24 h compared to 5.2 per 24 h after straight anastomosis within the first year after ileostomy closure (P = 0.053).	0.6866376541313807
Continence was slightly better in the pouch group (n. s.), and anal manometry showed a significant postoperative decrease only in resting pressure after straight coloanal anastomosis (P < 0.001).	0.6148742527643146
This study supports the construction of a colon-j-pouch after deep rectal resection, as the pouch-anal anastomosis has fewer local septic complications and seems to improve functional outcome.	0.6146744225448484
The introduction of flow-directed pulmonary artery (PA) catheters has helped to improve our knowledge of cardiovascular physiology.	0.48827000645484303
There have been several developments of this equipment in recent years, including continuous monitoring of mixed-venous O2 saturation (Sv\=O2) and cardiac output (CO).	0.5891929109184856
The high purchase price, however, is an obstacle to its use in the critically ill.	0.7017526396382723
The aim of the present study was to analyse the actual costs of these devices in comparison to standardly used intermittent monitoring of Sv\=O2 and CO.	0.5692354607028444
Purpose: Persistent hypotony with maculo-pathy is a severe complication of mitomycin C when used during filtration surgery.	0.4143801228446949
We wanted to know whether this complication can be controlled by a surgical reintervention yielding tight closure of the initial sclerostomy.	0.5937687493945738
The detection of cytokines may elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms that produce early systemic complications in acute interstitial (i) or necrotizing (n) pancreatitis (AP).	0.5958379133571962
The increase in the level of cytokines in the blood of patients with AP may correlate with the severity of the disease.	0.8551777512738681
In a prospective clinical trial from October 1992 to August 1993, 23 patients with AP were recruited and blood samples taken for cytokine detection by commercially available Elisa kits and C-reactive protein (CRP) by laser nephelometry.	0.5753382530481178
Six of 11 patients with nAP died either early (n = 1) or of late septic complications.	0.5890113208152136
The peak of cytokine and CRP level in the first 3 days of hospitalization was used for calculation.	0.7910360004468431
The IL-6 concentration in the blood reached up to 2600 pg/ml in the 1st few days, depending on the severity of AP, and dropped to almost zero in the next days, independently of the clinical course.	0.646932292016433
The differentiation of i- versus nAP, using a cutoff line of 600 pg/ml, was correct in 20 patients [87 %, sensitivity (SE): 82 %, specificity (SP): 91 %, P < 0.001].	0.7144327448855052
The blood levels of IL-8 reached a maximum of 1381 pg/ml in the 1st few days, depending on the severity of AP, and showed a correlation with the clinical course in the following days.	0.7203306678558097
The peak of IL-8 blood levels indicated correctly the severity of AP in 18 out of 23 patients using a cutoff level of 200 pg/ml (accuracy: 78 %, SE: 82 %, SP: 75 %, P < 0.01).	0.5700277478104083
The CRP levels increased up to a maximum of 535 mg/l and indicated the course of AP correctly in 18 out of 22 patients (SE and SP 82 %, P < 0.01).	0.5485510122472594
There was no correlation between cytokine blood levels and mortality.	0.5260729358822321
In the blood samples of five patients with i- or nAP, no TNF- was detectable.	0.8808721095676281
The blood levels of IL-6, and to a lesser extent of IL-8 and CRP, can predict the severity and early systemic complications of AP.	0.8267976549768501
The excessive rise in cytokines can be explained by the stimulation of immunological cells (macrophages, lymphocytes and endothelial cells) in the course of AP, inducing early systemic complications.	0.5730517792681841
The surface area and the microporosity of bone regeneration materials influence their chemical and biological properties.	0.41570812093648046
Therefore, the size of the specific surface area and the distribution of the pore diameters (pores < 1 µm) of bone regeneration materials were analyzed within this study.	0.6957524522204476
The analyzed hydroxyapatites were of synthetic, bovine, and phytotroph origin.	0.4786583036156746
The tricalcium phosphates and the bioglasses included only synthetic materials.	0.2237411221366833
The gas adsorption of each specimen was analyzed using a volumetric N2/Kr system (ASAP 2010, Micromeritics).	0.34031626630501444
Additionally, for materials with a specific surface area (> 2 m2/g) the pore size distribution was evaluated by the BJH-method.	0.8057719743888377
Two of the materials evaluated astonishingly large dimensions of the specific surface area (BioOss 79.7 m2/g, Algipore new 14.6 m2/g).	0.4619981268522549
A medium surface area was found for Algipore old (4.9 m2/g) and Interpore200 (2.64 m2/g).	0.8045310242066875
All other included materials showed only small sizes of the specific surface area (Ceros80 1.8 m2/g, Ceros82 1.31 m2/g, Cerasorb 1.2 m2/g, Biobase 0.7 m2/g, Endobone 0.7 m2/g, Perioglas 0.6 m2/g, Allotropat50 0.23 m2/g, Biogran 0.2 m2/g).	0.520919348061038
The materials with large and medium sizes of the specific surface area evaluated the following pore diameters: BioOss 2-50 nm, Algipore new 2-100 nm, Algipore old 5-50 nm, Interpore200 2-100 nm.	0.4692508998236045
Pore sizes less than 2 nm were not found in relevant numbers.	0.5137951075374694
The materials BioOss, old and new Algipore, and Interpore200 contain a large interconnecting mesopore system (diameter < 1 µm).	0.5644785957485338
For the materials Biobase, Endobone, Perioglas, Allotropat 50, and Biogran this cannot be assumed.	0.48490789213041163
The materials Ceros80, Ceros82, and Cerasorb evaluated a specific surface area between those and might include only a small part of these interconnecting pores.	0.5426453302530312
An influence of the interconnecting porosity and the different sizes of the specific surface areas on the biological behavior of the bone regeneration materials can be suggested.	0.6805213983518605
The literature on the psychosocial aspects of head and neck cancer surgery from 1950 to 1995 was reviewed in four parts.	0.3480447957724949
In the present Part 4 ten possibly useful targets for future research are formulated:...	0.5830270378473625
Radiotherapy unequivocally has to be regarded as standard therapy in stage I and IIA/B testicular seminoma.	0.5598717938698989
Using low dose abdominal irradiation tumour control rates of 95-98 % in stage I disease and 80-95 % in stage IIA/B can be achieved.	0.7679390699505351
Disease specific survival reaches 100 %.	0.31456430167545535
Likewise, radiotherapy is treatment of first choice in case of testicular intraepithelial neoplasia (TIN) in a solitary testis or in case of a double-sided TIN yielding safe eradication of the in-situ carcinoma of the testis.	0.6987670553538318
Objectives of further clinical research in radiotherapy of testicular malignancies aim at reduction of treatment intensity in order to minimize acute and late side effects of irradiation without compromising tumour control rates.	0.5425792904963735
A forty year old healthy adult man was admitted to our out-patient department because of a highly elevanted rheumatoid factor.	0.5755754266848975
Since the person was planning an extended stay in Africa, we performed an extensive history, clinical and laboratory examination to rule out oligosymptomatic inflammatory diseases.	0.7069938675464157
We further analyzed if the person presented genetic risk factors to develop rheumatic diseases in the future or if the presence of the rheumatoid factor could be a reaction to multiple immunizations.	0.6312677861849234
Possible explanations for an elevated rheumatoid factor including the genetic risk factors are discussed.	0.5141272954337669
A multifactorial etiology underlies the  majority of cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD).	0.4574792581897479
Both ill-defined environmental and genetic factors contribute to the development of the disease.	0.5127825295982762
Allele 4 of ApoE is a genetic risk factor.	0.368005970056165
Its presence increases the risk of developing AD.	0.5763636341743886
However, presence of e4 is neither necessary nor sufficient for the disease to arise.	0.538810560357302
Apart from the common multifactorial forms of the disease, there are rare variants which are inherited as Mendelian traits.	0.6114730594425907
To date three genes are known that can be  mutated in these rare forms of AD.	0.4573619570054188
Of these, mutations in the gene presenilin 1 on chromosome 14 are most frequent.	0.47310952857923555
In addition, mutations in the gene presenilin 2 on chromosome 1 and in the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP on chromosome 21) occur in autosomal dominant AD.	0.5127441072468791
This article reviews our present knowledge of the genetics of AD and discusses its relevance for patients with AD and their relatives.	0.6439385229656829
In recent years female psychoanalysts provided fertile approaches to an understanding of the mother-daughter-relationship with the conceptions of the 'lesbian complex' (Poluda-Korte), the 'symbiotic illusion' (Halberstadt-Freud), the 'higher permeability of the ego-boundaries' (Rohde-Dachser), and the 'conflict of separation-individuation which has to be resolved again and again throughout life' (Berger).	0.5395177920044968
In the light of these conceptions it is hypothesized that in analyses with both participants being of equal gender (female-female psychoanalyses) a specific intensity and quality of female aggression may manifest itself when certain threshold situations of the pre-oedipal mother-daughter-relationship are revided.	0.4462678270193846
Case vignettes and a literary example illustrate the risks as well as possible resolutions engendered by these early relationship dynamics, as these are reactivated in the here and now of the analyst's relationship towards her patient.	0.5013331481239431
There has been a marked increase in the incidence of pelvic fractures over the last few years.	0.6913030093553415
Associated injuries to the urogenital and vascular system as well as nerve injuries worsen the prognosis.	0.47120204140033717
Over a five year period 126 patients with severe pelvic trauma were treated.	0.5471656351211583

In type B injuries the anterior pelvic ring was stabilized with a tension band wiring in four cases, in two patients with an external fixator and with plate osteosynthesis in one case.	0.8751645580370331
In type C injuries the external fixator was applied as the only stabilizing procedure in six patients.	0.6627507968006955
In four cases the anterior ring was fixed with tension band wiring or plates and the dorsal aspect of the pelvic ring with sacral bars.	0.5900048627925456
Three patients had their additional acetabular fracture plated through a anterior approach.	0.41386608990706836
All surviving 28 patients were followed up for an average of 18 months (range 7--59 months) after the trauma.	0.8845067148585505
The patients were classified using the pelvic outcome score proposed by the German Society of Trauma Surgery.	0.6995251096976359
53.4% of the type B fractures showed a good clinical outcome, 47.6% a poor outcome.	0.8468450102934144

Seven patients died in the emergency room due to uncontrollable bleeding, four in the intensive care unit from multi-organ failure.	0.5900666246944766
The management of complex pelvic trauma consists of fracture treatment and interdisciplinary treatment of the associated injury.	0.5847503868809948
Lesions of the abdominal organs or of major vessels must be addressed first if hemodynamic instability is present.	0.5235921690891305
Injuries to smaller vessels can be embolized percutaneously.	0.28228356923308856
Urinary bladder ruptures are treated as an emergency, urethral lesions electively after four to six weeks .We recommend external fixation of the pelvis in the acute phase for control of both the osseous instability and control of haemorrhage through external compression.	0.7103148113609177
The treatment of choice for the anterior pelvic ring is tension band wiring or plating.	0.6442087917413608
If this is contraindicated due to an open fracture external fixation is the treatment of choice.	0.6958306168834908
Type C fractures require posterior ring stabilization which should be postponed until four days post admission.	0.38731007482015894
Dysfunction of serotonergic neurotransmission has been associated with two different psychopathological syndromes - impulsive aggressivity resulting form a lack of stimulation of the "behavior inhibition system" on the one hand and the manifestation of clinical depression and compulsive syndromes on the other.	0.58291106518342
The examination of primate behavior provides a model which may reconciliate these seemingly contradictory hypotheses.	0.4139839512100926
According to primate experiments, monoaminergic depletion results in anxious and desperate behavior only if the individual has previously been exposed to social isolation stress, which in turn induces a decrease in the central serotonin turnover rate.	0.5598007104168446
Young non-human primates who experience early social separation stress are anxious and fearful, while as adults they tend to be aggressive, consume excessive amounts of alcohol and are less intoxicated by alcohol intake.	0.4495142155137041
These observation indicate the importance of social separation stress in the pathogenesis of alcoholism and antisocial behavior and may point to prophylactic and pharmacological treatment strategies.	0.44381813182831353
The implantation of transsclerally sutured posterior chamber lenses (PCL) leads to greater trauma to the eye than endocapsular PCL implantation.	0.3866438280012807
Persistent breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier might impair the postoperative long-term prognosis.	0.5350459643104741
Using laser-tyndallometry, we quantified the disorder of the barrier function during the early postoperative phase and in the long-term postoperative course for both surgical procedures.	0.7575074434212447
During the first 3 postoperative days, flare values were three times higher in the group with transsclerally sutured PCL than in the conventional PCL group.	0.804068186464928
Cell counts after transscleral suture fixation (27.7 +/- 18.3/0.075 mm3) decreased slightly during the first 5 postoperative days.	0.6139114639290933
In contrast, the conventional PCL group regained the preoperative level (2.5 +/- 5.1) after 3 days.	0.8550555929646425
After 3 months, no significant differences in flare values and cell counts were seen between the two groups.	0.7023189462071806
After implantation of transsclerally sutured posterior chamber lenses, breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier was initially more pronounced than in conventional PCL implantation.	0.49267288361737294
However, the barrier function was re-established equally in both groups in the long term.	0.7080669346294467
No signs of a persistent disorder of the barrier were found.	0.6299609977313759
There is clear evidence for obstructive sleep apnea as an independent cause of arterial hypertension.	0.5319592842415235
We report a case of intracranial hemorrhage with systemic hypertension resistant to antihypertensive medication, which could only be adjusted after effective treatment of coexisting sleep-disordered breathing.	0.6225840749740928
The 36 year old male (body mass index 31 kg/m2) was admitted to hospital three weeks before for intracranial bleeding at the left external capsule.	0.6110616706025302
Diagnosis of primary hypertension was made after extensive work-up in the acute hospital.	0.8224872130029721
Blood pressure was adjusted with five-fold antihypertensive medication at the time of admission to neurological rehabilitation, but was still elevated with "non-dipping" as determined by long-term measurement despite medications above the recommended dosages.	0.6444599534097286
Polysomnography confirmed the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea.	0.4375161932547495
10 days after initiation of treatment with nasal CPAP blood pressure control was easier with normal dipping at night.	0.4988854439211317
Medication could be reduced during rehabilitation with further reduction after discharge.	0.4475509809353169
Moderate obstructive sleep apnea appears to be the cause of severe hypertension resistant to pharmacological therapy in this patient.	0.6865309793978849
The case underlines the impact of diagnosis and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing for the secondary prevention of stroke.	0.6471192414889858
The possibility of a specific origin of joint infection should be considered in finding the diagnosis.	0.6767931074757219
This is demonstrated in a case of tuberculosis of the hip treated in the Dept.	0.8366444545908864
of Trauma Surgery in collaboration with the Medical Dept.	0.626479805887216
Microbiological and imaging examinations are essential to plan and perform a combined therapy of hip arthroplasty and concomittant medical antituberculous therapy.	0.5161824767576308
In accordance to a literature review, this procedure proved successful for both eliminating the local infection and the functional outcome of the operation.	0.8635213975667146
The purpose of our studies was to investigate experimentally the dose-dependent effects of extracorporeal shock waves on tendon and bone and to unveil therapeutic possibilities in tendopathies and pseudarthroses.	0.662849493549062
From January 1994 to January 1996, 18 patients underwent vitrectomy as a result of endophthalmitis.	0.5988584147215956
All patients received intraocular and systemic antibiotics in accordance with the first group of patients in the Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study.	0.7550196707776337
The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze the visual outcome of surgical treatment.	0.7261700016217416
Tracheostomy is considered the airway management of choice in long-term ventilated ICU patients.	0.6759524455175212
In the last few years, percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) has been established as an attractive and safe alternative to conventional open tracheostomy.	0.7738636680936912
Recently, there is another percutaneous technique according to Fantoni with translaryngeal airway access (TLT) available.	0.44020422347530186
Our study seeks to evaluate TLT in terms of complications and practicability.	0.44147483635716017
In 47 patients of our surgical ICU, elective TLT was performed.	0.46397017334570123
Mean operative time was 9.8 +/- 10.9 (range 6-27) minutes.	0.7889196664447575
Severe complications, such as bleeding, aspiration or infection of the tracheostoma have never been noted.	0.48812557234113096
A slight detoriation of arterial oxygen tension occured in 25 patients intraoperatively, demanding to rise the concentration of inspired oxygen temporarily.	0.4411738891067702
However, no patient became hypoxic during the procedure.Since during the procedure gas exchange may worsen, TLT should not be employed in patients whose inspired oxygen concentration exceeds 80%.	0.6496511062973702
Despite the fact that severe complications associated with TLT have recently not yet been reported, physicians who perform TLT should be well-trained in the technique of conventional open tracheostomy, too.	0.5838283604825215
According to our present data, TLT seems to be an attractive and safe alternative to PDT.	0.7192275289422443
Nevertheless, for a definiteve evaluation of TLT, further investigations in larger groups of patients and in the long term seem to be necessary.	0.9559555028273409
There are no direct associations between testosterone levels and sexual function in the aging male.	0.6069374610082543
A study of 169 patients focusing on the relations of hormone levels and sexual dysfunction did not reveal associations between testosterone levels and the risk of altered sexual functions.	0.5598849737608897
In volunteers, in whom a hypogonadism was generated by the application of GnRH, no alteration in sexual reactions occurred.	0.6836486236894618
It is possible that other testosterone fractions are more meaningful than the total testosterone.	0.5590999894682248
However, all the known fractions correlate closely.	0.6723645769672117
The significance of a normal testosterone level for a normal erection has been rarely considered up to now.	0.6506098798636106
In an animal experiment, the intracavernous pressure, the density of -receptors, and the PDES activity depended on normal testosterone levels.	0.7832913436918931
It is not known whether different testosterone levels influence the effectiveness of treatment procedures for erectile dysfunction in humans.	0.6221334048754563
In a 65 years old male patient 38 cc of a 7.45% potassium chloride-solution was inadvertently infused within 3 hours into an epidural catheter on the first postoperative day.	0.6189717317376636
The epidural potassium chloride administration resulted in a paresis and painful paraesthesia of the patient's legs and a level of sensory blockade to TH 11.	0.5368677449622837
Furthermore vegetative symptoms like hypertension and tachycardia were observed.	0.22401094639067284
For therapy a single bolus of 40 mg dexamethasone was administered intravenously followed by an epidural infusion of sodiumchloride 0,9% 99 cc/h for several hours.	0.4949568207657189
About 6 hours after the start of infusion all symptoms had disappeared.	0.3629490312478905
It is proposed that the use of colour-coded epidural catheter devices and coloured electrolyte solutions as well as infusion-pumps with a larger reservoir that reduce the frequency of syringe changes would be helpful in avoiding such complications.	0.4847509894791992
This paper reviews respiratory muscle/circulation interaction in congestive heart failure.	0.4288207950851691
Respiratory muscle dysfunction consisting of both reduced pressure - generating capacity and reduced endurance is well documented in these patients.	0.49613795271259237
The mechanisms underlying its development and the potential consequences especially in the development of dyspnea are then presented.	0.5524218007688272
Not only are respiratory muscles dysfunctioning in these patients, but under specific circumstances they can impede the circulation, such as during weaning from mechanical ventilation.	0.47241938866883293
The underlying pathophysiology and the theoretical model explaining this interesting interaction is finally discussed.	0.37009387930762083
Traumatic, perilunate dislocations are rare lesions, and one third of them are associated with perilunate dislocation fractures.	0.6982755060344605
Unfortunately, one quarter of all such fractures go unrecognized, although conventional X-rays can allow their diagnosis in as many as 48% of cases, which can be improved by performing CT or bone scan in addition to 62% and 95%, repectively.	0.7572075330919673
Forced extension seems to be the most frequent trauma mechanism.	0.7543562263235875
The treatment consists of open reduction, predominantly of the lunate bone, and internal fixation.	0.7526207053675182
Huge carpal fragments such as the scaphoid and capitatum are ideally fixed by means of compression screws, while smaller fragments can only be aligned with Kirschner wires.	0.5247588548407343
Osteochondral chips are best reinserted into the bone by means of anchoring systems.	0.34201055574379946
In cases of complex carpal instability supplementary stabilization may be achieved with an external fixator.	0.6887228144492004
The best results on the Martini evaluation score were achieved in simple perilunate dislocations that were reset early by open surgical procedures and were accompanied by minimal involvement of/damage to different tissues.	0.494532109694188
Although we had a nonunion rate of approximately 20% in our series of 11 mixed traumatized patients in all, the Martini classification of hand function seems to be a reliable score system for practical clinical follow-ups.	0.7718914470439879
Maternal anxiety in the event of a false positive result is an argument against universal hearing screening in newborns.	0.43353983773918586
The aim of this study was to investigate the mothers' attitudes towards neonatal hearing screening and their anxiety in case of a positive result.	0.6224018322591216
Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon- (IFN-) were both administered subcutaneously (SC) in combination with intravenously (IV) applied 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for the treatment of patients with metastasized renal cell carcinoma (RCC).	0.78009757522548
The therapy protocol consisted of a treatment cycle of 8 weeks, which could be carried out in an outpatient regimen.	0.701653002641364
The IFN- was given in each of the 8 weeks (6-9 MU/m2 once to three times weekly SC) combined sequentially with IL-2 (5-20 MU/m2 three times weekly SC for 4 weeks) and 5-FU (750 mg/m2 IV weekly for 4 weeks).	0.8220364639280754
Among the 30 consecutive patients treated, in 2 cases a complete, and in 9 cases a partial, remission was achieved in patients with mostly lung and skeletal metastases, with an overall objective response rate of 37 %.	0.783040581826857
Mean response duration was 8 months (range 3-18 months).	0.6161456288092317
A stable state of the disease lasting 3-18 months was observed in 10 cases.	0.8973339414483353
The side effects were only slight and corresponded to toxicity grade I (n = 2), grade II (n = 22) and grade III (n = 6), according to the WHO classification.	0.6403371645261587
In conclusion, this triple-drug biochemotherapy demonstrated significant clinical effectiveness comparable with that of an aggressive IL-2 treatment regimen (applied IV), but without its high toxicity.	0.634606202804845
Compression therapy was employed for 4 weeks 20 patients with chronic venous insufficiency stage CVI I and CVI II according to Widmer's classification.	0.6351502626808244
Compression bandaging for 2 weeks was followed by compression stockings for 2 more weeks.	0.3638310995151797
The cutaneous microcirculation was evaluated before therapy, after 2 weeks and after finishing compression therapy after 4 weeks.	0.5965959508502122
Marked improvement in symptoms such as pain and itching was observed after 4 weeks, along with a significant reduction in lower limb volume.	0.5536974166211779
Video capillary microscopy revealed an increase in capillary density associated with a decrease in capillary diameter and pericapillary halo diameter.	0.46644157243716367
Compression treatment achieves at least part of its effect by improving the function of the skin microcirculation.	0.597658500281237
The efficacy of bandaging and stockings was similar.	0.2724441674086175
The splanchnic perfusion is reduced early in the course of any shock.	0.36445180857908094
The mucosa of the gut suffers most as it experiences a high oxygen demand even in the steady state.	0.4844566051022844
The specific arrangement of the micro vessels within the villus of the mucosa exposes the tip of the villus at the highest risk for ischemia, particularly in low flow states.	0.5712623547877371
As a consequence the integrity of the mucosal layer is compromised and dysfunction of the mucosal barrier may allow bacteria and toxins to translocate from the gut lumen.	0.5691526272737257
Activation of leukocytes and stimulation of cytokine synthesis may comprise a sustained inflammatory response syndrome.	0.38817967596715425
So far there is a good body of evidence that the splanchnic region may play an important role in the pathophysiological sequence from shock to organ dysfunction.	0.638348169618441
As pacing impedance is inversely related to pacing current, the increase of pacing impedance additionally decreases pacing current.	0.4655796101113133
Whether the impedance measurement at implantation predicts the outcome during follow-up, was studied in 87 patients who received the VDD-single lead UniPass 425 connected to the pacemaker Unity (Sulzer Intermedics).	0.5071698941772064
The impedance changes between implantation and 6 months follow-up were assessed for each patient.	0.6313674790481523
Similar impedance values were defined, if the two measurements were within a range <= -100 to +100 .	0.7617311437473926
Six-months impedance was lower or higher compared to implantation, if the difference exceeded > -100 or > +100 .	0.7311113505274432
At implantation, impedance was 535  +/-  98  (range: 333-811 ) and significantly increased to 604  +/-  160  (range: 361-1150 ) after 6 months.	0.7459427354941685
Mean difference between the two measurements was 69  +/-  162  (range: -336 bis +560 ).	0.8118513800255978
Similar impedance had 43 (implantation: 527  +/-  75 , 6 months: 531  +/-  87 ), lower values 11 (implantation: 660  +/-  83 , 6 months: 494  +/-  73 ) and higher values 33 patients (implantation: 503  +/-  99 , 6 months: 735  +/-  168 ).	0.6520236569138244
Compared to the patients with similar impedance patients with lower impedance had a significantly higher impedance values at implantation.	0.7259507985040565
Conclusions: Pacing impedance increased significantly within 6 months after implantation.	0.5123881446142202
Pacing impedance changed > 100  in 51% of the patients.	0.7040808814974001
The long-term follow-up of pacing impedance can be predicted generally, but not for the individual patient.	0.8125415819375688
Endothelin has both vasoconstrictor and mitogenic properties and might, therefore, play a role in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes and coronary atherosclerosis.	0.4615123884838189
The aim of the study was to characterize the mechanisms and kinetics of cardiac endothelin-1 (ET-1) release following a local endothelial injury during PTCA (group A) and after sustained myocardial ischemia (group B).	0.7551873883786794
Additionally, the precision of agreement between measurements in coronary sinus and peripheral venous samples should be analyzed.	0.5008343157434834
Since first described in the early 1990s, coronary magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has evolved as a promising noninvasive modality for imaging of the coronary arteries and evaluation of coronary artery disease.	0.8332170138102026
Despite technical limitations, coronary MRA has established value for imaging of anomalous coronary artery and assessment of bypass graft patency.	0.57549368046981
Current research focuses on the development of optimal respiratory compensation strategies, improved spatial and temporal resolution and faster acquisition of image data.	0.44316972579492026
The accurate detection of stenoses and assessment of the severity of coronary atherosclerosis is presently being evaluated with large multicenter studies.	0.5967152691478729
With further technique enhancements and more clinical experience, coronary MRA is likely to become the dominant noninvasive modality in clinical cardiology.	0.5239004614153259
Which consequences can be ascribed to the intraarticular position of devices in the operative treatment of a slipped capital femoral epiphysis?	0.5306580828761034
Which steps are to define as a standard of a careful procedure?	0.5754788935280355
A digitised three-dimensional (3-D) image of the face has many valuable uses.	0.7496573835641956
These include accurate measurements of facial morphology, clinical documentation and objective analyses of surgical procedures.	0.5618801876122644
A new system presented here, based on stereophotogrammetric techniques, instantaneously captures digitised images using high-resolution cameras.	0.4802797418393945
It has an accuracy of more than 0.5 mm RMS and creates the 3-D image from approximately 20,000 points.	0.6475000179667602
The principles of the image capturing are demonstrated and the potential uses discussed.	0.5899191782832001
Surgical changes of the soft tissue in two patients following orthognathic surgery are also illustrated.	0.701287667185709
This new capturing and measurement system provides a simple method of determining 3-D changes in soft tissue following surgery and is a useful tool for clinical purposes.	0.6357276260719213
A potential impact of tricyclic antidepressants on oral anticoagulation is controversial.	0.30423816688869804
Phenprocoumon - the most commonly used anticoagulant in Germany - is rarely considered in clinical trials.	0.950563244355109
In the present study, a potential drug-drug interaction between phenprocoumon and tricyclics, causing an alteration in prothrombinemic effects, has been investigated.	0.646040721353828
To analyse the possible injuries of vertebral segments, especially the disc, after unstable thoracolumbar fractures stabilised with AO internal fixator, we performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the traumatised region after implant removal.	0.6952011229564102
There were two aspects of disc degeneration (DD): (1) biochemical changes and (2) structural damage.	0.6025169202269575
MRI detects biochemical processes as one aspect of DD that is often small even in the presence of greater structural damage of the nucleus pulposus caused by fracture.	0.46750644056755225
None of the patients presented with structural failure of the anulus fibrosus, which is the essential structural component of the vertebral segments with regard to stability.	0.8555588575131599
We observed biochemical changes more often in the lower of the two fracture-adjacent discs and alterations of discal shape more often in the upper of the two, whereas loss of height concerned both discs to approximately the same degree.	0.7583708226365342
The supporters of upper-disc resection in thoracolumbar fractures justify their procedure among other things with the structural disc damage, such as alteration of shape and loss of height (altogether more frequent in the upper disc).	0.5076456461304122
Our observations that a disc with a structurally altered nucleus pulposus can be biochemically intact and can show an intact anulus fibrosus are arguments in favour of disc preservation.	0.388019399735754
With regard to the upper disc, the widespread opinion that complete and regular disc damage requires a resection has to be revised.	0.6714504687159851
The question of whether the lower disc should be resected more often because of its greater biochemical changes cannot be answered by the present study alone.	0.6998948807037997
Besides the excellent static information in all anatomical structures of the vertebral column available by MRI, a repeat examination in a prone position yields dynamic information on the spinal cord in the case of suspected dorsal adhesions.	0.6316925353683899
To study the frequency and clinical aspects of cold urticaria in Central Europe, patient data from a university dermatology clinic and a private dermatology office between 1984-94 were analysed and the patients reexamined if possible.	0.5985971415901826
The incidence of cold urticaria was found to be 0.05%.	0.6377489684350145
Of the 56 patients with cold urticaria (31 women, 25 men), 49 had idiopathic cold urticaria.	0.6010141017846788
The mean age was 41.0 +/- 15.6 year, the mean duration of disease 7.9 +/- 5.8 years.	0.8493525469780668
Atopy was found in 46.5% of patients, and 23.2% of the patients suffered from other types of urticaria (cholinergic, chronic idiopathic, dermographic, aquagenic and heat-induced).	0.7230350269011261
Laboratory examinations were only rarely abnormal.	0.3207332061489856
44 patients were treated with antihistamines, with generally only moderate symptomatic improvement.	0.6589393768886307
Treatment with antibiotics (penicillin, 1-2 mil IU/d over 2-4 weeks, n=18, or tetracyclines, 2 g/d over 2 weeks, n=10) induced full remission in 13 patients and symptomatic improvement in 8.	0.6381812345030422
During an average of 6.5 year-follow-up, 20 of 43 symptomatic patients went into spontaneous remission.	0.6519014477288729
The good therapeutic response to antibiotics in this study underlines the need for a better elucidation of the cause of cold urticaria, in view of possible infectious causes.	0.7372296771852715
Background: Since its first implantation as an eyeball replacement in the United States in 1985, hydroxyapatite has been rarely used as an orbital implant in Germany.	0.5697646722679341
The aim of the study was to collect data on long-term tolerance, postoperative complications and the cosmetic end results.	0.6769565869836235
A 37-year-old woman had intensive care for 105 days and artificial ventilation for 72 days because of a lung transplantation and multiple postoperative complications.	0.5542920997247482
She developed severe heterotopic ossification of both shoulders, the right elbow and both hip joints.	0.5880615323688948
Owing to complete joint stiffness, she was immobilized and unable to eat or drink without help.	0.3752756672446032
Operative treatment was performed in two procedures.	0.6918633632523062
The right shoulder and right elbow were operated on first; the right hip and later the left hip were operated on after recovery from the previous surgical procedures.	0.6201969458909629
After 22 months, there was a good functional result; the patient took part in all activities of daily life and was pain-free.	0.8129645508319117
The present knowledge on heterotopic ossifications is summarized, as well as possible prophylactic measurements.	0.5345662901068858
Background: Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) is one of the most common forms of supraventricular tachycardia in the pediatric population.	0.6375318336741927
Patients and methods: 41 children with a mean age of 9.6 (3.7-16) years with recurrent atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) refractory to medical treatment (n=38) and recurrent syncope (n=3) underwent electrophysiologic (EP) study.	0.7434110655959935
In all patients dual AV-nodal physiology could be demonstrated during EP study and typical form of AVNRT (mean heart rate 220/min) could be induced by programmed atrial stimulation.	0.6566302185905794
A steerable 7 F ablation catheter was placed at the inferoparaseptal region of the tricupid valve annulus close to the orifice of the coronary sinus with the intention to record a late fractionated local atrial electrogram during sinus rhythm.	0.5259858489224698
Starting at this point radiofrequency current (500 kHz) with a target temperature of 70 °C was delivered with the intention to ablate the slow pathway.	0.6133531750015047
If a slowly accelerated junctional rhythm (<120/min) occurred during energy discharge, programmed atrial stimulation was repeated.	0.6006088023970264
Otherwise radiofrequency current was delivered step by step up to a septal position next to the tricuspid valve annulus.	0.4342163488605599
Slow pathway ablation was defined as lack of evidence of dual AV nodal pathways during repeated atrial stimulation.	0.48085609003163393
Slow pathway modulation was defined as maximal one atrial echoimpulse after ablation.	0.36809263403252895
Results: The number of energy applications ranged from 1-19 (median 6).	0.7219643561306166
In 35/41 patients slow pathway ablation could be achieved; in six patients the slow pathway was modulated.	0.5918697313151726
In none of the patients permanent high grade AV block was observed.	0.6153332393541764
During follow-up (mean 4.1 years) two patients had a recurrent episode of AVNRT after slow pathway modulation.	0.8476099816422735
All other patients are still free of AVNRT without medical treatment.	0.5543230953014774
Conclusion: Selective radiofrequency current ablation/modulation of the slow pathway is a safe and curative treatment of AVNRT in young patients.	0.5238922625301469
Since we had the impression that there was an increase in blood loss during mammaplasties after a change in the anesthesiology department responsible, we conducted a study to compare 28 cases from each anesthesiology department.	0.7077852270377295
All operations were carried out by the first author in succession using the same operative technique.	0.6327200909238612
The two groups did not differ in age, BMI, operative time, weight of resected tissue or preoperative laboratory.	0.7476709112796708
Blood loss was calculated from the perioperative drop in hemoglobin and patient's blood volume.	0.5005446506545933
Blood pressure, heart rate, medication and intravenous fluid supply were obtained from the anesthetic protocols.	0.4894430969774163
Results (means and standard deviations): Group I (n = 28) and [Group II (n = 28)]: total resected tissue 1862  +/-  928 g [1912  +/-  791 g]; Hb-preop.	0.5917303955016142
13.6  +/-  0.9 g/dl [13.8  +/-  0.8 g/dl]; Hb-postop.	0.7365252252863468
10.8  +/-  1.3 g/dl [9.7  +/-  1.3 g/dl] P = 0.006; Blood loss 970  +/-  339 ml [1443  +/-  456 ml] P < 0.001.	0.7289699559150981
After exclusion of surgical or biological causes hemodynamic effects of the anesthetic techniques were suspected as the reason for the significant difference in blood loss.	0.6594244689774732
MAP was elevated only initially, while the heart rate was considerably elevated throughout the procedures in group II.	0.773100265562704
During anesthesia with nitrous oxide and enflurane, the dose of enflurane in group I could be limited to 0.3-0.5 % after initial i. v. administration of 60 to 100 µg sufentanil, while in group II without opioids doses of 0.5-2 % were required.	0.9235970543100175
The well-known dose-dependend effect of enflurane on the peripheral vascular tone was not masked by vasoconstrictors at the operative site.	0.4471130546166946
Conclusions: Blood loss during mammaplasties can be affected considerably by the anaesthetic technique - even without deliberate hypotension.	0.645392276929525
Sufentanil can indirectly reduce the blood loss by lowering the necessary dose of enflurane.	0.5342775272969718
Blood transfusions can be avoided at mammaplasties.	0.5456504004751253
Continuous epidural infusion of bupivacaine with the opioid fentanyl represents an effective analgesic method in the therapy of strong postoperative pain after major surgery.	0.5659409183852601
Preparation of the required infusion solution in syringes with a volume of 50 ml immediately prior to administration is routinely performed by nursing staff in Germany.	0.43399761779287793
The effort required for the preparation is associated with logistical and pharmaceutical difficulties.	0.45565308256399295
The preparation of a mixture of bupivacaine hydrochloride 0.06% and fentanyl 0.0002% in 250 ml infusion bags at the pharmacy of the University Hospital Mainz is described.	0.5643302301739924
To determine the physicochemical stability, the concentration of bupivacaine-HCl and fentanyl was assessed using HPLC over a period of 32 days; in addition the pH values were determined.	0.6879304443300291
After 32 days 95% of the bupivacaine hydrochloride and fentanyl baseline values were recorded.	0.4858640850196969
The pH baseline value had decreased from 5.48-5.52 to 0.5-0.7 units.	0.756165861591326
The measured values confirm the physicochemical stability of the mixture of bupivacaine hydrochloride 0.06% and fentanyl 0.0002% over a period of 32 days.	0.46047814818652666
The infusion bag can be stored for 4 weeks at room temperature.	0.4018915532915984
The programming of a cochlear implant speech processor used by young children is often difficult, especially when the stimulus level associated with maximum auditory loudness (MAL) needs to be determined.	0.5664977730460686
Excessively high stimulation should be avoided as this can have a traumatic effect.	0.5687924523923711
The aim of this study was to determine if a relationship exists between the intraoperatively determined electrical stapedius reflex threshold (ESRT) and the postoperatively determined MAL and hearing threshold for 27 patients, each having one of three implant types.	0.6283957486099255
The question of whether the ESRT provides a practical technique to simplify, improve and accelerate speech processor programming was investigated.	0.4645436806338438
For the monopolar stimulation mode used for the Med-El and Clarion implant systems, the average MAL and threshold was expressed as a percentage of the average ESRT across all electrodes.	0.5820591864966612
For the "common ground" stimulation mode used for the Nucleus implant system, a parabolic transformation was used to relate MAL and ESRT to one another.	0.5865471965649972
These transformations between MAL values calculated from the ESRT and the actual MAL values, determined psychoacoustically, diverged considerably from one another.	0.45521103462010604
Therefore, it was not possible to determine the MAL from the ESRT with certainty.	0.8657350146938972
The ESRT does, however, provide a means to estimate an approximate upper boundary for the MAL, apart from its use to control implant function.	0.400322264472367
The determination of the exact MAL will still need to be determined using behavioural techniques.	0.5934057375685228
Movements and vibrations of intraocular structures can be observed during vitrectomy with mechanical cutting systems.	0.45716638630858325

Spontaneous rupture und false aneurysms of the non-arteriosclerotic aorta are rare.	0.30836906061558517
We report on a 53-year-old patient with false aneurysm due to covered rupture of the thoraco abdominal aorta following sarcoidosis initially repaired by semicircumferential aortic end-to-end anastomosis.	0.5091245554470042
After 6 months local recurrence occurred and the afflicted aorta was replaced by autologous arterial graft, transferring the right iliac artery as aortic patch.	0.4749442391250249
The iliac reconstruction was performed by PTFE interposition.	0.5771855907480657
There was no specific therapy for sarcoidosis.	0.5913896677016526
At 1 year follow-up there was no recurrence and the patient is free of symptoms.	0.9027518331031611
In this biomechanical study the implanted Unreamed Humeral Nail (UHN) has been tested concerning bending and torsional stiffnesses.	0.4832079565198381
In literature other intramedullary implants have been critisized for insufficient rotatory stability especially in transverse and short oblique fractures of the humeral shaft.	0.4237484593795469
This study examined, whether the implanted UHN, as well as the UHN implanted with interfragmentary compression through a specific compression device, is able to augment torsional stiffness significantly.	0.6060810909312891
To evaluate bending and torsional stiffnesses, the UHN has been compared biomechanically to the Russell-Taylor humeral nail (RT) in paired mid-shaft osteotomized cadaveric humeri.	0.5127585135365512
Identic paired comparison has been performed with the UHN without and UHN with interfragmentary compression.	0.47294124231145446
In anterior-posterior, as well as medio-lateral direction stiffness under four-point-bending is significantly higher in stabilizing with the RT.	0.429499641857202
Under torsional loading with moments of 4 Nm, 6 Nm and 8 Nm the UHN reached more than the double torsional stiffness.	0.4586883290147357
The RT, which is only dynamically interlocked, owns a high initial "play" between bolts and nail itself.	0.5085176858836855
Through additional interfragmentary compression stiffness of the UHN under four-point-bending in anterior-posterior, as well as medio-lateral direction augments significantly.	0.36020136810276543
Also under torsional loading with moments of 4 Nm, 6 Nm und 8 Nm torsional stiffness increases with interfragmentary compression significantly.	0.39581944677527026
In comparison to other biomechanical studies of different autorship it is clear, that this statically interlocked intramedullary nailing of the humeral shaft is superior to non-statically interlocked types of nailing concerning their stabilizing potency in torsion and serves especially for fracture types, which are critically under rotation, as transverse or short oblique humeral shaft fractures.	0.616478005155984
While the different national health systems merge structurally, cost expansion in health care is a global challenge.	0.4878046054122417
Structural reforms have been developed during recent years in the USA which can be summarized as "managed care".	0.655824790472306
They are characterized by the evolution of an economically orientated system, in which units of medical therapy are generally handled like conventional economical goods.	0.6451713776096939
In managed-care models, patients are deliberately directed to the most economic forms of therapy.	0.6541505838325545
The spectrum of medical interventions as well as diagnostic or therapeutic patterns are predefined by a system of contracted guidelines, which lead to a standardization of processes.	0.6113719800338676
Financing and medical executive responsibilities fuse.	0.218969953572789
The autonomy of medical decisions is clearly reduced to enforce an integrated and economically oriented steering of the health system.	0.4401690281691276
Leadership is no longer primarily confined to doctors or scientists.	0.44884078412459
It is progressively shifting to financing institutions, managing directors or insurance companies.	0.2684769938478864
Structural changes currently are expanding rapidly in the U. S. and have meanwhile led to marked regional reductions of medical costs.	0.43418910388541126
Nevertheless, the US model is still far more expensive compared to the German system.	0.7035952642858719
Historical development, current concepts of US-managed care, its potential influence and general applicability to the German situation are discussed in an overview.	0.6657363217612545
On the subject of natriuretic peptides there is a great deal of controversy, and intensive research efforts have been made studying their effects on electrolyte homeostasis.	0.7604881300597716
In the early 1980s, a peptide that caused diuresis, natriuresis, and had a relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle was discovered independently by several groups.	0.6780028226673076
This was the breakthrough for the identification of natriuretic peptides, followed by the characterisation of the amino-acid sequences of several species.	0.509472778766439
Synthesis of the peptide, cloning of the encoding gene, identification and characterisation of specific receptors, as well as the development of antibodies and radioimmunoassays were rapidly accomplished.	0.5313301970118602
Research on the immunohistochemistry of cardiodilatin/atrial natriuretic peptide (CDD/ANP) and the regulation of CDD/ANP gene expression led to detection of the peptide in extra-atrial tissues.	0.5939737385773199
Later on, two new peptides were discovered brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP).	0.5400677602108406
These peptides share structural features with CDD/ANP with regard to their 17-amino-acid-exhibiting loop bridged by a disulfide bond.	0.40833487584246886
Another recently discovered peptide is urodilatin (URO), a renal-borne new member of A-type natriuretic peptide.	0.4793273489678735
URO was isolated from human urine and consists of the same sequence as CDD/ANP, containing the 17-amino-acid residue loop of the circulating hormone with 4 additional amino acids located at the NH2-terminus of the peptide.	0.5140428173134481
Regarding physiological actions, data strongly support a close association between URO and urinary sodium excretion.	0.40786168827613295
The application of URO in animals revealed a stronger diuresis and natriuresis with a lower influence on arterial blood pressure compared to CDD/ANP-99-126.	0.4656405837321323
These results were encouraging for the use of URO in clinical trials as a tool to prevent acute renal failure (ARF) in patients following heart transplantation and for treatment of incipient ARF in patients following liver transplantation.	0.6961671848712934
Summarising the results of these two studies, URO represents a new approach for not only prevention, but also for treatment of ARF following organ transplantation.	0.8359882312180511
This opens up new possibilities for the treatment of ARF of other origins in intensive care medicine.	0.42144595236227356

Methods: Eleven patients (median age 43.8  +/-  17.2) with bile duct complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy were operatively treated between November 1993 and December 1998.	0.7260272176395426
Nine patients (four type-II lesions, five type-IV lesions) were referred from another hospital; 2 defect lesions out of 410 laparoscopic cholecystectomies (0.5 %) were documented in our own patient group.	0.7192540402774564
Results: Four patients with late strictures were operatively treated with a hepaticocholedochostomy (n = 2) or hepaticojejunostomy (n = 2) after 14.3  +/-  8.4 months and were discharged from hospital after 10.6  +/-  3.8 days.	0.822121230857223
In both cases with type-IV lesion and a short defect, an end-to-end anastomosis was successful (hospital stay 11.6  +/-  1.0 days).	0.7623478299902025
However, a retrocolic Roux-Y end-to-side hepaticojejunostomy was perfomed in all cases with a larger defect (n = 5; hospital stay 14.8  +/-  2.0 days).	0.769014795154708
The two defect lesions in our own group were detected by intraoperative cholangiography and immediately treated after conversion either with hepaticocholedocho-stomy or hepaticojejunostomy (hospital stay 11.2  +/-  0.6 days).	0.6177110874186539
Conclusions: The incidence of bile duct complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy might be kept down by anatomic preparation, selective intraoperative cholangiography and early consideration of conversion to open procedure.	0.4995547363517753
The clinical course after biliary tract injury can be positively influenced only by a standard diagnostic and operative procedure and by an early transfer to a specialized center.	0.5951706111757012
In the last years the incidence of renal cell carcinoma diagnosis increased about 15-20 %.	0.7347142463439489
The main aim of this study was to analyse the reason of the increase of incidence.	0.6073621362969392
In the present autopsy series comprising 23.801 autopsies the percentage of patients who died of renal cell carcinoma is 1,77 % in Jena and 1,55 % in Königgrätz (200.000 inhabitants each).	0.7989798865836795
Over this time the incidence of renal cell carcinoma in autopsies has increased.	0.5550779576042956
With the advent of atypical antipsychotics, quality of life for patients with schizophrenia has improved significantly.	0.6542981590631277
The positive effects are based not only on the compliance-enhancing reduction of extrapyramidal side effects but also due to improved cognitive function and social integration, shorter duration, and overall reduction of hospital treatment.	0.5736547851092539
The mortality of perioperative myocardial infarction is still high and according to recently published data amounts to 17 to 42%.	0.5463467125289067
In the seventies introduction of thrombolytic therapy has led to a dramatic reduction in mortality of non-perioperative myocardial infarction.	0.5553864058812358
However, in the perioperative situation thrombolytic therapy remains to be problematic in most cases because of expected severe bleeding complications.	0.6476256852968918
In the last 4-6 years acute-PTCA has been established in the therapy of acute myocardial infarction.	0.8582644005787937
Up to date no data are available concerning the effect of acute-PTCA on mortality of perioperative myocardial infarction.	0.5629581051737393
Nevertheless it can be assumed, that acute-PTCA will lead to a considerable reduction in mortality of perioperative myocardial infarction.	0.7378839217337001
Therefore, in patients with significant perioperative myocardial infarction immediate coronary angiography and, if indicated, acute-PTCA should be performed.	0.8456391655570163
In principle, thrombolytic therapy is considered to be contraindicated in the intra- or postoperative situation.	0.6743058976208608
However, if coronary angiography and PTCA are not possible, thrombolysis might be taken into consideration, in particular if the expected bleeding complications are small in relation to the expected benefit of thrombolysis.	0.774273821719833
Since acute-PTCA has been shown to remarkably reduce mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock after acute myocardial infarction, this group of patients should be especially considered.	0.6760214736673734
Medical theories and practices concerning illness and health in old age as well as several aspects of society that do influence the aging process are described from a historical perspective integrating classical antiquity, middle ages, and modern times.	0.4903757103263235
From the present state of research it is distinguished between "primary illnesses in old age" and chronical diseases which might principally also begin in younger ages but take a different course in old age.	0.5586534477652216
Even if the frequency of disease and multimorbidity is increasing, negative stereotypes of the aging process have to be invalidated.	0.6739967682924384
Advances in medical sciences are a good pre-condition for increasing physical and mental health in old age.	0.4655893081470783
The analysis of wall motion abnormalities with dobutamine stress echocardiography is an established method for the detection of myocardial ischemia.	0.632057428487172
With ultrafast magnetic resonance tomography, the application of identical stress protocols as used for echocardiography is possible.	0.5043305286855971
Transvaginal ultrasound provides an early and accurate technique to assess first trimester pregnancy.	0.4003306373326407
Beginning with the demonstration of an intrauterine gestational sac, sonography enables further evaluation of normal pregnancy development, such as identification of the embryo, visualization of the yolk sac, and the presence of fetal cardiac activity as a reassurance of fetal viability.	0.6072561496646701
Furthermore it allows closed sonographic monitoring of early intrauterine pregnancy and distinction between normal and abnormal development of pregnancy.	0.40711817524109717
A prediction in terms of pregnancy outcome can be made regarding pregnancy complications or specific risks like vaginal bleeding, the demonstration of intrauterine hematoma, advanced maternal age, early growth delay or fetal bradycardia.	0.5839791454917702
Because of the marked heterogeneity of patient groups and the diverse causes of obstruction, surgical therapy of the small-bowel ileus is difficult to standardize.	0.7887801957441927
A homogeneous strategy of intraoperative handling of the obstructed bowel (decompression, endoluminal splinting) as well as abdominal closure would be desirable.	0.4305715526975079
Adhesiolysis remains the most common procedure.	0.6598288896661698
Small bowel plication is still used by a minority of surgeons with the Noble's technique replaced by the Child-Phillips' technique and its modifications.	0.46173430961391526
However, as a result of the lack of controlled studies, there is no large body of evidence available to support the use of plication, long tubes or any other specific surgical intervention.	0.7239959319651977
This is an important task for the future, especially in view of incidence and economic importance of small bowel-ileus.	0.7603853789256232
Purpose: The purpose of our study was to determine the value of MRI in monitoring laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy (LITT) of cerebral neoplasms.	0.6535490349838062
A 70-year-old woman with severely symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy was unresponsive to drug treatment.	0.4599383785115182
She had recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias and syncope and was at high risk for sudden death; a dual chamber pacemaker defibrillator (DDD-ICS) was implanted.	0.644675268726956
Her initial left ventricular outflow tract gradient was 80 mmHg and fell to 40 mmHg during dual-chamber pacing at an atrial ventricular delay of 140 ms.	0.38198818945762153
In the follow-up over six months she was asymptomatic with respect to angina pectoris; ventricular tachycardias could be successfully terminated by antitachycardia pacing or by shocks.	0.4643822693958933
A dual chamber pacemaker defibrillator is an important therapeutic option for patients with symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and ventricular tachyarrhythmias.	0.6052085216288865
Morbihan's disease was first reported as a distinct entity in 1957 by Degos, describing a chronic persistent erythema and oedema of the upper half of the face.	0.6346503266778115
Such conditions have been noted in the literature designated as chronic lymphoedema or solid persistent facial oedema in acne or rosacea.	0.5151434772823056
The characteristic features are a chronic course, a typical clinical picture, lack of specific laboratory and histological findings and refractoriness to therapeutic measures.	0.6904977692674555
Paediatric cardiac transplantation (pHTX) has gained widespread acceptance as a therapy in end-stage myocardial failure and some forms of congenital heart disease, particularly hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS).	0.5644134987801898
The major problems to the anaesthesiologist in these patients are induction of anaesthesia in infants with HLHS and treatment of pulmonary hypertension in the early post-bypass period.	0.9214503608888893
Objective: Thirty years ago, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was primarily developed for otherwise healthy individuals who experienced sudden cardiac arrest.	0.5363685430901841
Today, CPR is widely viewed as an emergency procedure that can be attempted on any person who undergoes a cessation of cardiorespiratory function.	0.5558417082245373
Therefore, the appropriateness of CPR has been questioned as a matter of the outcome, the patient's preferences, and the cost.	0.9826760866760894
The objective of this article is to analyse ethical issues in prehospital resuscitation.	0.5027324509731418
Arguments: CPR is bound by moral considerations that surround the use of any medical treatment.	0.4208787084086927
According to Beauchamp and Childress, the hierarchy of justification in biomedical ethics consists of ethical theories, principles, rules, and particular judgements and actions.	0.48761180738686927
The decision to start CPR is based on the medical judgement that a person is suffering from circulatory arrest.	0.5387486781554607
The decision is justified by the moral rule that the victim of a cardiac arrest has the right to survive and to receive CPR.	0.5768081949338844
Moral rules are more specific to contexts and are based on ethical principles.	0.42337306073539527
The principle of beneficence means the provision of benefits for the promotion of welfare.	0.33566755236223556
Talking about beneficence in resuscitation means once again reporting stories of success, as many victims of pre- and in-hospital sudden death have been saved in the past.	0.7108234845658904
Nevertheless, resuscitative efforts still remain unsuccessful in the majority of cases, involving the principle of nonmaleficence.	0.5189246876620469
There is potential harm in CPR.	0.20882310851618677
Survivors may recover cardiac function, but sustain severe hypoxic brain damage, at worst surviving without awakening for months or years.	0.5025807488593718
In particular, post-traumatic CPR is associated with an extremely poor outcome, leading to the issue of futility.	0.6357197011080881
However, futility should be defined in a strict fashion, as there might be an individual chance of survival.	0.606218545267272
The principle of respect for autonomy means the right of a patient to accept or reject medical treatment, which continues in emergency conditions and after the patient has lost consciousness.	0.7511923341198424
The time frame in CPR requires medical decision-making within seconds, and CPR is usually initiated without the patient's involvement.	0.5509370303711697
If the patient's wish's can be ascertained later on, life-sustaining therapies might be withdrawn at that time.	0.5413036563640047
Terminally ill but still competent patients should be encouraged to write a no-CPR document, which does not deny patients relief from severe symptoms, but might facilitate withholding resuscitative efforts at the scene.	0.5432658411510679
The principle of justice affects priorities in the allocation of health care resources.	0.4563542508036837
The decision made for a particular patient might delay or prevent emergency treatment in other patients who could receive greater benefit.	0.5258046999725158
Conclusions: The standard of care remains the prompt initiation of CPR.	0.6659198375808979
However, ethical principles such as beneficene, nonmaleficence, autonomy, and justice have to be applied in the unique setting of emergency medicine.	0.6656276087852255
Physicians have to consider the therapeutic efficacy of CPR, the potential risks, and the patient's preferences.	1.0294383349705793
Acting within the context of the therapeutic process is often equated with acting-out.	0.637537466119559
Subtile behaviour, too, as a part of the "complex system of sending and receiving unconscious signals" (Sandler) which serve for the patient to induce behavior of the transference object in the analyst or fulfilling his unconscious wishes is seen as acting-out or microacting-out (Treuniet).	0.6371110548087721
However, this delicate acting has no meaning, it is not symbolic or communicative action.	0.6692765944559291
It is aimed at inducing effects and interactions.	0.31492819517462284
It appears both on the side of the analyst and of the patient and is part of the unconscious communication in the therapeutic process.	0.9064761581769709
Diverse interactive means and ways will be demonstrated, how the analyst is moved to unnoticed acting and to handling the patient in an unnoticed manner in a certain way.	0.5071553735010854
The acting-reactions of the analyst may have the character of interpretations, by which he unintentionally demonstrates, in what a way he understands the patient.	0.5852144319507956
Background: The therapy of phimosis is circumcision.	0.6907646195242847
Since many years it has been discussed, whether phimosis is treatable with local estrogen application analogous to the treatment of labial synechia in girls.	0.5638855697997139
This conservative treatment depends on the presence of estrogen receptors (er-alpha) in male prepuce-cells.	0.5914431209008708
Findings in previous investigations have indicated that contrast-enhanced colour Doppler can be used to improve the demonstration of characteristic features of neovascularization in malignancies.	0.63634794937304
However, the quantification of the increase in colour Doppler signals after Levovist in the cited study relied only on descriptive criteria defined by the investigator, resulting in a subjective scoring system.	0.5586436460216941
A computer-assisted method for quantitative analysis of colour pixel density is a novel approach for objective assessment of colour Doppler signal after contrast media administration.	0.5449999731110869
After microbubble contrast medium injection in 47 patients, carcinomas and benign lesions behaved differently regarding degree, onset and duration of Doppler enhancement.	0.4328402560962016
However, the high interindividual variability and the temporal variations of the Doppler signal still limit the value of these criteria for prospective diagnosis.	0.6763172859295244
Rapid image-acquisition techniques are needed in order to apply the necessary mathematical processing before the contrast kinetics can be used for diagnostic purposes.	0.5896398141567741
Recent studies have shown that increased intraocular pressure following keratoplasty may cause progressive endothelial cell loss and thereby lead to early transplant failure.	0.45613628404736645
This study examined risk groups for development of postoperative glaucoma and thereby transplant failure.	0.4486013892899037
Dysphagia is a common complaint following surgical intervention in the oral cavity and hypopharynx, often leading to prolonged postoperative recovery.	0.657761293421949
Videofluoroscopy allows detailed visualization of deglutition, demonstrating the morphology as well as the functional aspects.	0.49842617636310227
Therefore, videofluoroscopy provides the basis for further therapeutic management.	0.5310048426017394
We discuss the pathology of deglutition in 19 patients recovering from tumor surgery of the oro- and hypopharynx.	0.6608351725655299
In most cases the results demonstrated severe impairment of both the oral and pharyngeal phase of deglutition.	0.6989895346350417
Our data emphasize the importance of the oral phase of deglutition for preparation and initiation of the following phases.	0.746503680501948
People who suffer a stroke most often experience a major crisis in their lives.	0.3655342555544657
This leads to psychological problems which are likely to influence the patient's life satisfaction, long-term rehabilitation outcome, and quality of life as much as the physical consequences caused by the stroke.	0.6966818821895497
The patient's ability to accept the new reality created by a disability as a part of their future life is therefore essential.	0.6030389397635543
This necessitates an individual coping strategy in the center of which is a mourning process, which unfolds in the same way as other experiences of vital threat, e.g.	0.6254452688107432
confrontation with one's own dying.	0.3558864969876691
Different stages of mourning that can also be found in stroke patients are nonacceptance of the facts, erupting emotions, parting with the former and finding of a new self as well as new perspectives for one's future.	0.5849869558882844
Whether a coping process is successful does not depend on the type of the defense mechanisms or stages, but essentially on their persistence.	0.6031658617492315
It is the task of the therapeutical team to support this process by applying a basic therapeutic behavior, stage-consistent interventions and a positive feedback.	0.6122937285900456
A failed process of coping may be one of the causes of the high prevalence of psychological disorders like depression and anxiety disorders in patients having sufferd a stroke.	0.6615392053271917
A 63-year-old woman developed a pruritic exanthema on the extremities after one hour of work in her garden pond in Planegg, Southern Bavaria.	0.4738125359108203
As the appropriate vectors (ducks and snails) were present, we made the tentative diagnosis of cercarial dermatitis (swimmer's itch).	0.5351452100642191
By different serological methods (cercarial fluorescent antibody test, cercarial Hüllen reaction, circumoval precipitin test) antibodies against cercariae could be demonstrated in the serum of the patient 14 days later.	0.5889794904465531
Cercarial dermatitis appears worldwide, but in Central Europe the disease is often not recognized.	0.8871302646691817
The current adjustment of cochlear implant (CI) speech processors is based on a knowledge of the lower and upper limits (T- and C-levels) for electrical stimulus currents.	0.700490548384597
These data are usually acquired from subjective classifications of individual patients.	0.42959888582317934
In cases with non-reliable patient responses, objective methods are necessary.	0.4466194270124789
Especially for the estimation of correct T-levels, auditory evoked potentials (AEP) can be applied, since they allow the determination of response thresholds in a frequency-specific manner.	0.6595247456778787
By determining the AEP of different latencies, late cortical responses can be registered almost without artifact contamination.	0.40879991662096904
These patients have been examined in 20 patients provided with 22- or 8-channel CI-systems (Nucleus or Med-El implants).	0.674301574165564
In all cases, clear responses and clearly discernible threshold transitions could be detected.	0.47574010700120706
By making use of acoustical stimulation in a free sound field, subjective hearing threshold and the T-levels of electrical stimulation could be verified.	0.4991286845761573
Since late responses are generated in the primary auditory cortex, their assessment permits a nearly integral functional control of the aided hearing system.	0.5255882856197984
To date, no problems have occured from maturation or attentional effects in either pediatric or adult patients.	0.4166684211372865
The applicability in very young children remains to be explored.	0.33055695885935565
Laparoscopic gastric banding has become a common procedure in bariatric surgery.	0.48376180535491625
Early as well as late complications are, in comparison to conventional techniques, rare.	0.7398340890373222
Complications arising from the operative technique are: perforation, early pouch dilatation, gastric slippage, infections of the port and the band, erosion and defects of the band tube.	0.6054801538804474
Insufficient weight loss and late pouch dilatation arise from unsatisfactory compliance on the part of the patient.	0.47041019911408366
In 7.5 % of 146 cases, reoperations were necessary.	0.690886929271554
Obstruction of the pouch stoma and a slippage resulted in total food intolerance.	0.44570985918563116
After radiologic diagnosis the band system should be deflated first and a naso-gastric tube applied.	0.30245278199518616
If this does not result in the pouch collapsing, a revision operation is needed.	0.7039828434617715
The significant legal and ecomonic ramifications of a positive drug test produce an incentive among users of illicit drugs to escape detection.	0.3557552877268686
Therefore, being the easiest body fluid to handle for drug screening urine is very often manipulated to test clean.	0.4235295877542066
Methods available to cause a negative result range from substitution of urine, adulteration of the collected specimen by various chemical agents and in-vivo manipulations.	0.48505057822365244
Among these, the preferred strategy is to increase fluid intake and urine flow so as to dilute the concentration of drugs below the threshold of detection.	0.5257915990615649
To determine the extent of possible specimen dilution the urinary creatinine concentration is generally determined.	0.48991621062478174
Based on data from uncontrolled and controlled fluid intake studies in the literature and physiological conditions of urinary excretion, the meaningfulness of creatinine concentration in randomly obtained urine samples is discussed.	0.600348441258272
A low creatinine concentration not clearly proving an intentional dilution of the sample, the application of GC/MS analysis or the concentration of the urine prior to drug screening is recommended for specimens exhibiting a "suspect" urinary creatinine concentration.	0.5731949102906608
Goal: Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring has a key role within the neuromonitoring, although ICP does not monitor processes of the central neuron directly and only with delay.	0.528416560894899
One of the important factors in ICP monitoring is measurement accuracy.	0.5649462631860607
For a better understanding of ICP probes and their differences, the function and principles of intracranial pressure transducers should be evaluated from a technical point of view.	0.6238442893846278
The therapy for spontaneous or artificial perforation of the esophagus remains a controversial matter.	0.5735807953914477
The following case report deals with the medical history of an artificial esophageal perforation after operative treatment of cervical disc disease.	0.6763532735444348
A 68-year-old male patient underwent a C4/C5 and C5/C6 discectomy with interbody fusion of C7-T1 vertebral body, according to Smith-Robinson.	0.3865191198753734
During this operation, a 3-cm-long lesion was made in the posterior wall of the esophagus, which was treated 24 h later with a primary suture.	0.8888281313673531
The clinical follow-up was complicated by mediastinitis with subsequent multiorgan failure.	0.5532467207375147
After recovery from this critical condition the patient complained of severe dysphagia, which was related to a persistent lesion in the posterior esophageal wall with endoscopically demonstrated dislocation of a screw.	0.6564341722521017
After removal of the screw, the lesion was covered by means of sternocleidomastoid myoplasty.	0.6777652672930833
Moderate postoperative dysphagia was successfully treated by bougienage.	0.4641294125313389
Introduction: The loss of functional capacity by peripheral nerve lesion is easy to be estimated: A certain neurologic dysfunction results in a characteristic reduction of the former individual capacity.	0.7401304143920368
In contrast, the effect of accompanying pain to every-day life and working ability is not known exactly.	0.5606811640161556
In this study, we compared the results of judgement in nerve lesions under the circumstances of additional pain syndromes.	0.6887703613055497
The guidelines of the International Union against Cancer are generally used to assess malignancy of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.	0.6628367993101549
Beside TNM-staging, histological grading is performed.	0.4508232643432027
This system has been extended by a selection of histological parameters which were studied with respect to prognosis, based on a review of 184 patients with squamous cell carcinoma.	0.6274405289494139
An increased malignancy was found in carcinomas with the following features: clinical diameter greater than 2 cm, low degree of keratinization, high degree of cellular polymorphism, high mitotic index and high tumor thickness index (metastases only from tumor thickness 2,4 mm and subcutaneous infiltration), desmoplasia and ulceration.	0.585714346504191
Consideration of histological tumor parameters improved prognosis assessment.	0.3276448827848164
Multivariate analyses with large case series are necessary to determine ranks of the prognostic factors.	0.47369374014061943
Therefore, the data analysis of all centers that contribute to the carcinoma registry will make a precise difinition of high- and low-risk carcinomas possible and can thus influence therapy and follow-up procedures.	0.8003366627767999
Surgical closure of atrial septal defects can nowadays be performed without preoperative cardiac catheterization.	0.38557320526581423
For a transcatheter closure, however, x-ray exposure has been indispensable.	0.47688295338731224
We report a closure of an atrial septal defect under transesophageal echocardiography without fluoroscopy.	0.5011608078020241
In field research, training intensity was tested during three different dances by recording the exercise heart rates.	0.44084599915617384
The subjects (twelve women from 59 to 77 years old) were tested once a week three times, over three minutes with a break of three minutes, three weeks in all.	0.5939497178117198
The sequence of the dances changed every week.	0.3403680198169061
Measurement of baroreflex sensitivity is a new method to identify patients after myocardial infarction with a high risk for sudden cardiac death, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.	0.8240984271809347
In this retrospective study the baroreflex sensitivity was obtained noninvasively by measuring the systolic blood pressure with a FINAPRES-device and correlating this with the R-R intervals of the ECG after raising blood pressure with an intravenous dose of Norfenefrinhydrochlorid (Novadral).	0.515668825225802
According to other investigators a correlation of >0.7 with a significance of p<0.05 was recommended for evaluable results with a baroreflex sensitivity <3 ms/mm Hg being judged as decreased.	0.5952448964641212
We investigated 302 patients (mean age 59 +/- 17 years, 224 males, 78 females).	0.6242929428719939
75% of the investigations showed acceptable results.	0.5686860819819743
In 77 cases (25%) reasonable results could not be achieved.	0.5173371005607171
We found premature ventricular beats to be responsible in 18 investigations (6% of all investigations).	0.7874486582967354
41 (13.1%) of all investigations were not evaluable because of bad correlation for unknown reason.	0.6725799956131054
When we looked closely at these nonevaluable results, we found a significantly higher number of patients with impaired left ventricular ejection fraction (<40%), diabetes or inducible sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia in the electrophysiologic study in this group.	0.7571445908935147
Embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas of the female genital tract usually occur during infancy in the vagina.	0.39972035401120387
Only in rare cases can they be found in the cervix, where they are most commonly seen in adolescence.	0.6852006614023913
Their prognosis seems to be good since the introduction of a combination of surgery and chemotherapy.	0.564636236894268
We report a case of cervical embryonal rhabdomysarcoma in IRS stage Ia in a 32-year-old female.	0.5390489191646088
After surgical resection and chemotherapy there has been no evidence of disease for 7 months.	0.7528302684053274
The case is compared with the published literature and prognostically relevant features, and possible problems in the differential diagnosis in biopsies are discussed.	0.7653581580241465
Between 1987 and 1993, 41 grade 3B open tibial shaft fractures were treated with the unreamed tibial nail (URTN n = 22) or an external fixator (FIX n = 19).	0.642566897252606
The method of treatment was left to the choice of the operating surgeon.	0.8404986898419634
Three below the knee amputations were performed, three patients died, and three were lost to follow-up.	0.7069333742806687
In all, 32 patients were followed up to union or at least for 1 year.	0.7069170749104419
There were no significant statistical differences between the two groups (P<0.2, chi-squared, t-test) with respect to fracture type, fracture location, age, gender or accompanying injuries.	0.7572297689938366
The URTN group showed significantly better results regarding time to full weight-bearing (URTN 11 +/- 4 weeks; FIX 20 +/- 11 weeks, P<0.01 M-W) Mann-Whitney Test, number of reoperations (URTN 1.04; FIX 2.89; P<0.01 M-W), isolated bone grafting (URTN 3/22; FIX 8/19; P<0.05 chi-squared), and average Karlström and Olerud score (URTN 30 +/- 4; FIX 26 +/- 5; P<0.05 M-W).	0.6440768451042257
In all, 15/17 URTN patients and only 6/15 FIX patients achieved unlimited walking distance (P<0.01 M-W).	0.5207016876374748
Time to bony union, infection, and nonunion were not significantly different between groups.	0.5128992540398045
By varying the light spectrum, impulse length, impulse sequences and fluences, the PhotoDermVL allows a large choice of individual treatment parameters.	0.5131191635272925
Superficial as well as deeper localized vascular malformations (essential telangiectases, port-wine stains, Poikiloderma of Civatte, hemangiomatous malformations) and cosmetically bothering hypertrichosis can be treated successfully with this high intensity polychromatic pulsed light source.	0.4548503488136902
Catheter ablation is an established method to treat paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.	0.5743753747940404
However, the risks of catheter ablation have to bee weight against antiarrhythmic therapy.	0.5978568919096007
With catheter ablation AV-block III °, pulmonary embolism, pericardial tamponade (in some cases followed by death), arterial embolism as well as other complications have been described.	0.6814699240918879
Especially the long term consequences of prolonged fluoroscopy time are an increased risk for fatal malignancies in young patients.	0.5680282579506621
On the other hand the efficacy of antiarrhythmic therapy in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia has been shown.	0.703226554785109
The risk of proarrhythmia associated with the treatment with class 1 and class 3 antiarrhythmic drugs that has been documented in patients after mayocardial infarction and in heart failure patients cannot be transferred to patients without structural heart disease.	0.6936417043021585
It is concluded that drug therapy is still an important form of treatment in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.	0.7284689621361441
Background: Chloroquine keratopathy is known as a disease with epithelial deposits in the cornea.	0.5687765109536554
The appearance of corneal changes does not seem to be related to dose and duration of treatment.	0.45651074674201403
The purpose of this study was to investigate microscopic changes of corneal morphology in patients treated with chloroquine in vivo.	0.5605215011337614
Dermatological rehabilitation treatment can take different forms: climato-therapy, baths, phototherapy and psychosomatic treatments.	0.3684764078132998
Which of these treatments is of most benefit to any one patient depends on his or her illness.	0.4335658062075194
Accordingly, a psychosomatic approach to dermatological illness is indicated mainly when a psychological disorder and a dermatological disease coincide.	0.46785389531296867
In addtion, dermatoses with psychological triggers or overlays, and also depression, pre-existing emotional disorders and special motivation for psychotherapy should be considered for psychosomatic treatment.	0.6168085374053108
Finally, patients who are having trouble accepting or confronting malignant skin tumours may also benefit.	0.5694073567711553
We report about the possibility of electrophysiological diagnosis and therapy in the treatment of a symptomatic left ventricular tachycardia which could not be treated effectively by oral medical therapy in a 10 year old boy with no obvious structural heart disease.	0.7787545006866496
By right bundle-bloc-like QRS-complexes in the surface-ECG, the diagnosis of the ventricular origin of the tachycardia was confirmed by transesophageal-ECG.	0.6698121677321811
This was followed by the first electrophysiological examination that showed increased leftventricular vulnerability.	0.5573186204316285
During this electrophysiological examination the tachycardia was terminated by stimulated singular premature beats.	0.3247059498453603
An oral medical therapy with sotalol was started.	0.349461439027568
After the phase of saturation the next ventricular stimulation was done, that showed no sufficient protection of sotalol against VT.	0.520747893884255
So the decision was made for ventricular ablation.	0.3422333759195844
After 5 high frequency-applications no furhter ventricular tachycardia could be induced.	0.35963317976246933
Since this intervention the patient lives without symptoms.	0.3135272355795228
The vertebral bodies and vertebral arches show a characteristic distribution of cortical and cancellous bone.	0.4047556509480672
The pedicles are loaded by uniplanar bending that is reflected by the arrangement of the Corticalis.	0.3458828687355177
The ligaments of the vertebral column consist of longitudinal and (with exception of the lig.	0.8059655268102724
longitudinale anterius) horizontal/oblique segmental ligament bundles.	0.2264512723492831
In combination with the anulus fibrosus, the ligaments work as a kind of gear system.	0.5569054240197168
They regulate the process of movements of adjactent vertebral bodies in a very precise manner and control the final phase of motion.	0.5229280120217805
Besides maintaining the necessary amount of pretension the intervertebral disc distributes the loads uniformly onto the adjacent vertebral bodies.	0.3144521631589744
The intervertebral joints are important for guided motion, by restricting the extent in specific planes and directions.	0.5279161563955377
Because of their position, they are able to take up the shear forces and to simultaneously restrict them in different planes.	0.5905088198763394
The integrity of the fascia thoracolumbalis warrants the protective function of the autochthonuos muscles.	0.3601388558963278
Prolonged immobilization or physical inactivity has been shown to produce increased bone resorption due to enhanced osteoclastic activity and diminished bone formation.	0.39648823034635905
These skeletal changes are a typical complication in tetraplegic patients, who are at risk of developing hypocalcemia.	0.6945452688739624
Hypercalciuria is the most characteristic symptom.	0.606806153175887
Risk factors for development of malignant melanoma have been investigated in several case control studies during the last decade, with some variation in results, partly with geographical region.	0.7107327283944452
Four studies have been conducted under the auspices of the Central Malignant Melanoma Registry of the German Dermatological Society; these have yielded consistent results allowing the identification of risk factors for melanoma development.	0.6483586879341952
The numbers of common melanocytic naevi, of atypical melanocytic naevi and the frequency of actinic lentigines were found by multivariate regression analysis to be the most important independent risk factors for melanoma development.	0.6849770160455365
Additional factors were hair colour, skin type and a history of naevus growth.	0.4873548383081233
A classification of relative risks was established by considering the first three risk factors mentioned, without any clear improvement of classification when further additional significant factors were taken into accout.	0.5862707929524286
For example, in individuals with more than 50 common melanocytic naevi, 5 or more atypical melanocytic naevi and simultaneous presence of actinic lentigines the risk of developing melanoma was found to be 100-fold that in persons with 10 common melanocytic naevi or fewer and without atypical melanocytic naevi or actinic lentigines.	0.6387030173945598
Early recognition of melanomas may be substantially improved if these risk factors are considered.	0.4370526990510646
Furthermore, intermittent intensive sun exposure (sunburns as indicator) before the age of 20 induces the development of melanocytic naevi, and after the age of 20 it contributes to the development of actinic lentigines; both factors are associated with an increased risk of melanoma development.	0.6856921527540643
Problem: Clinical and ultrasound data of neonatal hips were analysed to answer the question whether a neonatal screening is necessary or not.	0.6209330261018594
Method: Children born between 1.	0.4535479992092445
1995 were examined clinically and by ultrasound.	0.5433558863616601
The data were analysed by SPSS/PC.	0.531578886294835
Results: 5069 children with 10 138 hips were examined.	0.34118054885008897
85 % were mature (type I), 14 % were physiologically immature (type IIa) and 1.2 % were pathological (IIc, D, IIIa).	0.8792707483947794
The comparison shows, that from 119 hips with pathological ultrasound findings only 44 (37 %) had positive clinical findings.	0.6461098705796138
A screening that is restricted to children with positive risk factors (positive family history or breech position) would result in half of the newborns with pathological hips not being treated in time.	0.49753901115954646
The interpretation of three-dimensional (3D) structures of the coronary tree and the myocardium by a clinician demands a subjective visual integration of two-dimensional (2D) images of cardiac diagnostic procedures like coronary angiography and myocardial scintigraphy.	0.5400152889187083
Although in the conventional analysis of 2D display scintigraphic myocardial perfusion segments are arbitrarily assigned to three major coronary artery systems, the standard myocardial perfusion distribution territories correspond with the individual pathologic-anatomic coronary tree in only 50-60% of the patients.	0.5839599415596229
Hence, the mental integration ob both 2D images of coronary angiography and myocardial scintigraphy does not necessarily allow an accurate assignment of particular myocardial perfusion regions to the corresponding vessels.	0.552078827947331
For an objective assignment of each vessel segment of the coronary tree to the corresponding myocardial regions, we have developed a 3D "fusion image" technique and applied it to patients with coronary artery disease.	0.7072119278396062
Cause-and-effect relationships may be more obvious with 3D data fusion and may enable an easier comparison of anatomy and physiology.	0.43450803288829426
The physician's duty of professional discretion is one of the basic tenets at the heart of the doctor's profession.	0.5974396493175019
It is laid down in the physicians' professional code and determined ultimately by the patient's right to self-determination, which is regulated in §203 of the German Criminal Code.	0.7016994436792712
It is established in the ordinance governing physicians' work and has its origin in the patient's right of self-determination.	0.6531251095830276
It is also regulated in §203 of the German Criminal Code.	0.519823278104454
An exception can be made to the duty of professional secrecy if a patient gives express permission for this or if it is allowed or required by law.	0.5568479390796841
Some such exceptions are also specified in the German Social Code, although the physician's duty of disclosure is then always precisely stated, particularly when medical data in the strictest sense of the phrase are concerned.	0.6510475056175548
Borderline cases are described to illustrate how the rules of professional medical discretion are breached in the course of day-to-day business transacted between the statutory accident insurance firms and the physicians under contract to them, and some hints are given on how this can be avoided.	0.54569571552933
We report on a 56-year-old renal allograft recipient receiving cyclosporin A immunosuppression.	0.46384910543037233
During this therapy he subsequently developed the following cutaneous neoplasms: squamous cell carcinomas, basal cell carcinomas, Bowen's disease, actinic keratosis, sebaceous hyperplasia, a dysplastic naevus and, finally a nodular malignant melanoma.	0.4943731531166346
Adverse effects of the cyclosporin A therapy are discussed, with special reference to dermatologic effects and the implications for patient and doctor.	0.7695719438035469
With Multislice Spiral Computed Tomography (MSCT), existing indications for performing CT of the chest are strengthened and new applications are emerging.	0.5074595711047966
The high speed of MSCT improves efficiency, image quality and patient comfort of "routine"- imaging of the chest.	0.7523727293212121
The ability to cover large volumes with thin slices improves the evaluation of mediastinal lymph nodes and pulmonary nodules and allows for high-quality secondary reconstruction.	0.5655172098572944
If a comprehensive diagnosis of the mediastinal structures and the pulmonary parenchyma is desired, MSCT for the first time allows reconstruction of contiguous and high- resolution (HRCT) sections from the same set of thin-collimation raw data.	0.6285058906132427
This way, contiguous chest images of superior and HRCT sections of equal image quality compared to conventional CT scanning can be obtained.	0.4626494335803942
Vascular protocols greatly benefit from the high speed of MSCT: For imaging the thoracic aorta or pulmonary emboli (PE), the amount of contrast material can be substantially reduced.	0.5949977053834842
Owing to thin collimation, the detection-rate of small peripheral emboli can be significantly increased.	0.5562592568030703
If indicated, the entire subphrenic venous system can be evaluated during the same session, without additional contrast material.	0.6914540651990341
Abstract   Basis of the modern shoulder implants is the Neer II-system, a non constrained total shoulder prosthesis with conforming radii of curvature and improved protection against dislocation.	0.5978199768049346
The second generation of shoulder prosthesis is based on the geometric shaft design of the Neer II prosthesis and offers not only a variety of modular head- and shaft-sizes but also through different radii a physiologic rotation-translation-mechanism.	0.5628796156892589
The third generation of humeral head prosthesis carries the concept of an anatomic reconstruction one step further and enables the surgeon to adjust the inclination and the eccentric offset of the humeral head to restore the centre of rotation.	0.5381044639402082
The latest development in shoulder arthroplasty are humeral head prosthesis with a fully variable 3-dimensional modularity to independently adjust the prosthestic head position regardless of the individual shaft geometry.	0.5085636803020457
This achieves a 3-dimensional adaptability of the prosthetic head about the stem axis in the coronary and in the sagittal plane.	0.6734170457212761
Besides of the humeral shaft prosthesis an alternative concept of shoulder joint replacement is established - the replacement of the humeral head articular surface.	0.6690829870817646
A hemispheric surface prosthesis - cup arthroplasty - is cemented onto the residual humeral head, which eliminates the obligatory humeral head resection and the reaming of the medullary canal.	0.566386902138997
Bipolar shoulder prosthesis are humeral shaft prosthesis with a bi-rotational head system.	0.3837776225819834
Their indication is limited to pre-existing lesions of the rotator cuff and/or the glenoid surface.	0.6721040711227708
The inverse total shoulder prosthesis reverses the articular surface morphology of the humeral head and the glenoid.	0.5497552788200247
The hemispheric glenoid component serves as the centre of rotation for the concave epiphyseal proximal humerus component.	0.3674110929323325
This implant is especially used in cases of massive rotator cuff deficiences.	0.42263441756313835
The role of shoulder prosthesis in treating acute humeral head fractures needs special consideration.	0.45556985346364337
A fracture prosthesis has to restore the exact length of the humerus, the centre of rotation, and the anatomical retroversion.	0.8224240146015201
Positioning of the tubercula and their adequate osteosynthesis is most critical and fundamental to ensure a correct healing process.	0.4297507328463979
A failed consolidation of the tubercula does not lead to a satisfying result.	0.4705256232539265
The shoulder joint replacement can be sufficiently fixated in cemented, cementless or hybrid techniques.	0.46120389368799314
Today several component design variations of cemented glenoid implants exist.	0.24100728461354956
Their main distinction is the fixation system which can be divided into two main groups - the keel - and the peg-shaped glenoid components.	0.8102118132971606
The peg-shaped anchorage system shall guarantee a greater stability against shear-forces.	0.27385607065657913
Cementless glenoid components consist of a polyethylen inlay and a surface treated metal-back with an integrated fixation system.	0.4137460238644201
These fixation systems are object of intensive biomechanical research and range from conventional screw fixation to specialised cone systems and self-cutting cage-screw-systems.	0.40956154650147647
The critical area of cementless glenoid components is the transition zone of the PE-inlay and the metal-back because of high force development.	0.49228987076466374
The question of implanting a hemi- or total shoulder prosthesis is answered by the morphologic changes of the glenoid articular surface, which includes the size of the subchondral defect and the underlying etiology of the shoulder joint disease, and the age of the patient.	0.9393588287061146
Preoperative planning must consist of an adequate radiologic work-up - X-ray, CT or MRI - to accurately assess the glenoid morphology.	0.7396535248942953
G. Walch categorised the different glenoid lesions and developed a very important classification of possible glenoid deformations.	0.46928859139249973
To compare and evaluate the operative results one must consider the different shoulder prosthesis and the discrepancies between a hemi- and a total shoulder prosthetic replacement.	0.6919091174671103
Looking at the loosening and survival rate of the implant the results are related to the type of prosthesis and the preoperative diagnosis.	0.7938115487689741
The Neer total shoulder prosthesis has a 15 year survival rate of 87 %, compared to 74 % of the hemi-prosthesis.	0.648019162053054
The objective for the future has to be to further advance the development of prosthetic components, especially for primary joint replacement in acute humeral head fractures.	0.6819077185380762
Another point of interest is how to reduce the still existing high loosening rates of the glenoid components.	0.5083759020152568
A fairly new research-field is the computer-assisted surgery, e. g. navigation systems and robotics.	0.5227333663289059
The computer-assisted navigation could be of great advantage to accurately find the individual resection plane (inclination and restroversion) of the humeral head.	0.5628117537152115
The use of a surgery-robot could be very helpful to reproducibly achieve the desired conformity of the articular surface when preparing the glenoid.	0.5367896124456464
Two patients with complete paralysis of the axillary nerve are reported on.	0.6263546598246623
One case is well documented.	0.45287122233163474
In both cases there was very good functional adaptation, resulting from hypertrophy of the rotator cuff so that there was only a slight or no loss of movement.	0.6700569336128906
The rotator cuff should therefore be exercised at an early stage when there is isolated axillary nerve damage.	0.511358451043454
The function of the supraspinous muscle is also discussed.	0.38469728832250744
Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach (1792-1847) is generally known as the founder of modern plastic surgery.	0.48458145265680774
One focus of his work, apart from the physiology of transplantation and operative techniques, was reconstructive oral and maxillofacial surgery.	0.5159124578176695
This special aspect of plastic surgery as well as Dieffenbach's biography is presented in this historic article.	0.459041508704727
When a lifeless person is found in a bath tub, the emergency physician is obliged to give medical assistance.	0.618120796150031
If the patient is dead on arrival, the manner of death will in most cases unsettled.	0.6451733525312473
In these cases the physician should inform the police immediately.	0.595929509789053
Any alteration of the scene of death should be avoided.	0.5280885518082965
The purpose of this review is to outline the laparoscopic-endoscopic procedures that we perform for early gastric cancer.	0.5051841721847302
These procedures were applied to 29 patients.	0.475955607046193
Preoperative work-up included gastric endoscopy, barium X-ray examination, endoscopic ultrasonography, and histological examination, and surgery was performed in patients diagnosed as having mucosal gastric cancer for which endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) was difficult.	0.7569965362517784
Laparoscopic wedge resection of the stomach using the lesion-lifting method, by which a wedge resection is made while pulling up the full-thickness gastric wall, was carried out in the 16 patients with lesions of the anterior wall, lesser curvature, and greater curvature of the stomach.	0.7289629796283432
On pathological examination of resected specimens, the surgical margin and lymphatic or venous invasion were negative in all these patients.	0.5853113292399813
The histological depth of the lesions was m (mucosal cancer) in 15 patients and sm1 (slight cancer infiltration into the submucosal layer) in one.	0.7192823251559239
This one patient later underwent gastrectomy but no lymph node metastases were found.	0.4506147325390059
Oral nutrition was resumed for a mean ( +/-  SD) of 2.9  +/-  0.8 days after operation, and the duration of hospitalization after operation was 12.3  +/-  3.4 days.	0.8987791688495463
The 13 patients with lesions of the posterior wall of the stomach and near the cardia or the pylorus received laparoscopic intragastric mucosal resection.	0.5665261600884235
Laparotomy was required in 1 of these patients due to intraoperative hemorrhage.	0.7294849178236352
The surgical margins were negative in all 12 patients in whom laparoscopic intragastric mucosal resection was successful.	0.5062421859446247
Lymphatic or venous invasion was positive in 2, both of whom had sm1 cancer lesions of both of these patients were located in the cardiac region, total gastrectomy was avoided, and careful observation is continued.	0.7383069317097728
Oral nutrition was resumed 4.0  +/-  1.6 days after operation, and the duration of hospitalization after operation was 12.0  +/-  3.5 days.	0.8749952460252464
In addition, no postoperative complication was noted after either procedure, and all patients have been recurrence free for a follow-up period of 460 months.	0.7141956015348252
Selected properly, these laparoscopic endoscopic procedures are considered to be curative and minimally invasive treatments for early gastric cancer.	0.4746581212216098
Between 1988 and 1997, tumor resection was carried out in 18 irradiated patients (group 1: 36-72 Gy, 83 implants) and 22 nonirradiated patients (group 2: 92 implants) in the mandible and floor of the mouth, and these patients subsequently underwent mandibular endosseous implant rehabilitation.	0.7657715823474138
