The only substantial question that has arisen is the legislative basis.	0.39504583609044497
I can go into that in detail if the honourable Member would like but there is no doubt that we are on all fours with the Ombudsman on this important issue.	0.8102861053209297
We will be happy to incorporate Mr Patten' s notes into the bibliography, as another bedside book for the Members to bear in mind.	0.7074978178188592
As the author is not present, Question No 32 lapses.	0.4111197438257537
I apologise to Mr Vitorino for this parliamentary discourtesy. I am sorry.	0.763378101141208
According to the Rules of Procedure, you are not required to reply.	0.8672197031136175
I wish you a good evening.	0.507239420766872
Second Part	-0.0
Questions to Mr Nielson, who is replaced by Mr Patten	0.7317228907244937
Can I first of all emphasise how sorry my colleague, Mr Nielson, was that he could not be here but the honourable Members who are concerned about these development questions will know how important his mission is, trying to ensure that our agreement with South Africa survives.	0.8077127149598086
The Commission is prepared to look at the possibility of making an introduction to gender and development, part of the so-called induction courses for new staff, something that has been done already but not, I admit, on a regular basis.	0.8536624585229957
The training of staff moving to the delegations in the different regions is another entry point.	0.6226288284208481
The training then would be automatically performed without being compulsory.	0.34079377323968535
We also aim to include training in these issues in the basic training that our officials receive in project cycle management.	0.5652277669852593
As far as possible, we want to see this sort of training automatically built into programmes at the outset, instead of having to be tackled separately and later.	0.8166161697282837
My own view as a former development minister is that these issues should be mainstreamed themselves and tackled at the heart of training and not turned into a sort of optional add-on.	0.6043990116855408
The quest for equality should permeate the work of the Directorate-General for Development at all levels.	0.5946481235764516
It is not to be brought in as a "sort of optional add-on" .	0.7862996630897314
This must naturally lead to a reformulation of development goals and strategies, together with a transformation of institutions and processes so that both women' s and men' s priorities and needs are better reflected.	0.6216883632896335
In addition, measures must be taken to combat differences on the grounds of gender.	0.7445404928254694
Equality must permeate not only projects and programmes but also all overarching goals, action plans and strategies.	0.5226924481971438
It would appear that we are in agreement about this.	0.8640704669297807
However, responsibility for ensuring that due attention is given to equality lies with departmental and unit managers.	0.5736999041077853
If the latter do not have the required professional competence, then nothing will happen and gender mainstreaming will no longer be a priority.	0.8558780115930739
Extremely few members of the Directorate-General for Development, that is to say unit managers and more senior managers, have taken part in the gender courses that have been organised.	0.8350885234910964
Only one manager has participated in gender training, and for half a day.	0.7424963382111123
That is naturally unacceptable.	0.2632707285094467
What is the Commission prepared to do to ensure that unit managers and more senior managers go through the necessary gender training?	0.6975087850960284
Gender has in fact been included in the compulsory introductory course for new employees, but then with only one to two hours devoted to it on each course.	0.7535177829656535
This limited training element has, however, been removed from all introductory courses which have taken place in recent times.	0.6223329732538417
As I point out in my question, one to two days, and not one to two hours, need to be devoted to the subject.	0.9684181333913936
My question is this: is the Commission really prepared to comply with the adopted guidelines for gender mainstreaming at the Directorate-General for Development?	0.6807990036752248
Well I certainly take gender mainstreaming seriously and so does my colleague Commissioner Nielson.	0.3511966146018279
I must not go on about books, but I have just been reading the book by David Landis Barnhill on what makes some countries prosperous and some countries less prosperous and it is interesting to see there the importance that he attaches to gender issues, in the economic prosperity and political stability of societies, going back millennia.	0.8202841785991996
Secondly, in my view, while the training that we are talking about should not be compulsory - after all there is no compulsory training on anything in the Commission - it should be essential. And, since it should be essential, I would hope that everybody would make certain that they had adequate gender training.	1.0482277755559868
That goes for everybody at whatever level of seniority.	0.3150012994088275
It is not something which more senior officials can deem appropriate for their juniors but think that they are too grown-up or too senior to receive themselves.	0.6332415134511944
Thirdly, one of the best approaches to this issue is to integrate gender as an important and cross-cutting issue into the most popular courses for development officials and above all perhaps for the project cycle management course which is key to good management of projects on the ground.	0.7874319483338438
So I sympathise very much with what the honourable Member has said.	0.4569205513802385
I hope the approach that we are following both demonstrates practicality and the imperative of giving this the attention which it deserves.	0.6466378446595564
Since 1991, the Community has provided significant financial support to the New Independent States including the countries of central Asia.	0.9790776182838327
The major part of European Union aid has been provided under the TACIS programme.	0.6820786991726927
In 1998 and 1999 Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan received technical assistance of EUR 75 million.	0.3788201735757976
This assistance has delivered benefits in all sectors, in particular agriculture, infrastructure development, the private economy and the strengthening of institutions.	0.8270348802843142
Security considerations have prevented Tajikistan from benefiting fully from TACIS but a rehabilitation programme of EUR 7.2 million has been in place in 1998 and 1999.	0.6003512963190174
In addition to national programmes, the European Union has supported important regional actions in the energy, transport and environmental sectors.	0.904129121937279
Food security programmes in central Asia began in 1996, following two previous years when the European Union provided food aid in kind.	0.6438035437670118
These programmes have benefited Kyrgyzstan and to a more limited extent, Tajikistan.	0.6245047094035289
Funding for NGO programmes in Tajikistan amounted to EUR 7.42 million in 1998 and 1999.	0.39046695034032664
Over the same period, Kyrgyzstan received EUR 17 million.	0.28671454445079564
Since 1993 the Commission's European Community Humanitarian Office, ECHO, has been active in supporting the most vulnerable groups and sectors in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.	0.7176935021422881
In 1998 and 1999 EUR 3.8 million was granted to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan received over EUR 35 million, mainly for food, medical supplies, water and sanitation.	0.6444660502268836
Frequent monitoring and situation assessments have shown that European Union assistance is contributing to the stability of these countries and therefore the ongoing peace process.	0.7205896198048046
Mr President, Commissioner, there is a risk of Central Asia and the Caspian Sea becoming the Balkans of the 21st Century.	0.6311780342493223
That is why it is imperative to stabilise the two major states of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in particular. That is why I would like to ask you what you are actually able to do within your own sphere of competence, how the negotiations with regard to the partnership agreement with these two countries are going, that is, with regard to political relations that is.	0.9490591033864578
Of course, that falls within your remit; my next question falls within Mr Nielson' s remit in that it concerns environmental cooperation, in particular matters pertaining to water and the problems surrounding the cotton monocultures, which are the cause of great aridity.	0.8797037666040061
We were able, at the Istanbul Summit a couple of weeks ago, to meet and have discussions with some of the Central Asian republics.	0.7744525046294074
I am very anxious that we should strengthen our relationship with them.	0.8081521461997626
I can send the honourable Member, if he would like, a detailed breakdown of exactly where we stand on the negotiation of partnership and cooperation agreements with each of the Central Asian republics.	0.7786863309662909
Obviously everyone will hope that his prediction of what may happen in the future is on the gloomy side.	0.6910846398890842
But I have no doubt at all that he is right to point to the strategic importance of Central Asia.	0.9989491556447012
I have heard the honourable Member talk in the past about the Caucasus as well.	0.727793874096291
He is absolutely right to say that a Union which talks about conflict prevention should be looking at what it can do in these particular areas to ensure that there is not the sort of conflict in the future which has caused so much devastation in the Balkans and which has cost us a great deal more than we might have had to spend otherwise, had we taken more pre-emptive measures if those had been possible.	0.8703931647040276
So the honourable Member's remarks about the strategic importance of these regions are extremely well made.	0.5336905559252694
We are contributing to programmes in the region which have some ecological impact.	0.6505554680979042
Our food programmes are directly related to structural reforms in agriculture as well as poverty alleviation.	0.465035832158109
Those programmes themselves are intended to ensure that agriculture has a more soundly based position in those societies and does not consist simply of raping the land.	0.4374965836162037
There is an ecological aspect which we should continue to give priority to.	0.8765993859144654
We also take good note of the fact that the Member who has asked the question has applauded the Commissioner' s answer.	0.7933861097224219
This is not the usual state of affairs.	0.7958674114456618
And furthermore the Commissioner has not quoted from his bibliography this time.	0.4922882426872561
Thank you very much, Mr Patten, for your interventions today.	0.904214604733437
Question No 35 by (H-0778/99):	0.21074042500542314
Subject: Greek action plan for employment According to the findings of the evaluation of Action Plans for Employment, Greece and Italy are the main targets for criticism from the Commission for not properly carrying out employment support measures and policies.	0.7546630919088726
The report states that in Greece and Italy targets for improving ?employability? have not yet been reached and it is doubtful whether the policies to be implemented will enable the guidelines on preventing and dealing with long-term unemployment to be complied with.	0.7424160849115616
The report also comments that in Greece there are no plans for medium to long-term measures aimed at reducing employment tax and insurance charges, or for the satisfactory use of European Social Fund resources to support employment policies, and, in addition, that there are no exact employment figures.	0.9192370018774669
Could the Commission say whether the Greek Government has made any specific commitments on how to tackle the problems of youth and long-term unemployment, and what these commitments are? Has the government legislated for and put into place a suitable system for pinpointing, recording and monitoring fluctuations in unemployment, or are most of the measures perhaps still limited to counting those out of work?	0.7798552683867708
As far as Mr Papayannakis' question is concerned, in the 1999 Action Plan for Employment, the Commission proposed certain recommendations for Greece with a view to improving the efficiency of the Action Plan for Employment.	0.8132817121543126
The most important recommendations related to the need to improve efforts to reform public sector services, where problems exist, improve the statistical monitoring system and apply preventive policies in accordance with guidelines 1 and 2 of the Action Plan for Employment.	0.706037351244841
The Greek Government introduced two specific programmes in 1999 as part of its employment policy: "Yes to Work" and "Back to Work" .	0.7026797270892897
We do not yet have the final results of these programmes and cannot yet tell if the quantitative objectives were achieved.	0.6377505766024529
The Greek Government acknowledges the problem of its being unable to record human resources entering and leaving work and is therefore committed, firstly, to restructuring public sector employment services in Greece, secondly, to setting up efficient employment promotion centres - this programme has already started but has not yet been completed - and, thirdly, to introducing a system of electronic employment cards and using suitable IT systems to monitor all these policies.	0.7549551560081603
In the new programme submitted for the period from 2000 to 2006, which is being financed from the Social Fund, both the resources and the policies should be used, with the Commission' s support, to implement the objectives which I referred to earlier.	1.1274366506584437
The Commission will keep a close watch on the Greek Government in order to ensure that it honours the commitments which it has made.	0.8179893988799191
Thank you, Commissioner for your reply.	0.8120088628049011
However, our current situation is as follows: at 11.3%, we have the second highest unemployment in Europe, which was not previously the case, we have the biggest increase in unemployment, we spend less than anyone else on the unemployed, i.e. less than 1% of GDP, while other countries, such as France, Belgium and Germany spend 3-4%, and it is not clear how the money received from the Social Fund has been used, inter alia, to combat unemployment.	0.9263303777528186
You tell me that you, as the Commission, have made recommendations.	1.130511880092617
I understand and welcome that and I hope that the recommendations will be adhered to.	0.6062548410015536
However, my question for a very long time has been this: what happened with previous policies?	0.8011322725218671
Did anyone find work?	0.1135071303654804
How many people found work?	0.3877687859916636
If you cannot tell us for this year, then last year and the year before.	0.8308985824739591
What has been done about training?	0.7851485933959971
Is the purpose of the famous training centres to provide jobs for instructors or trainees?	0.39128833304886707
Do we have any figures?	0.5471134977598785
In other words, do we have ways of checking what is happening with this government policy in Greece?	0.7466395152373626
Mr Papayannakis, the only answer I can give you is that the Greek Government does indeed need to step up efforts to introduce computerised statistical records and to set up structures so that the programmes implemented have the quantitative results which you mentioned, and so that monitoring can be carried out and used as a basis for formulating policies.	0.8027467331479018
Greece has seen an increase in the employment rate and, as far as I can see, an increase in productivity.	0.9088039756451116
The action which the Commission can take relates to the specific guidelines.	1.0003718034696147
As you know, there are 22 guidelines on which each country is evaluated.	0.6629984264627492
They concern access to training, the ratio of men to women with access to training, and special action for the long-term unemployed.	0.6522753905010127
The Commission will endeavour, for all these specific guidelines, to quantify the data and to obtain specific information based on the implementation of the new Community framework for 2000 to 2006.	1.048364780547265
Question No 36 by (H-0782/99):	0.16073674930136828
Subject: Danish early retirement pension scheme Will the Commission state whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme has been approved in its entirety and whether there are disagreements between Denmark and the Commission in other areas of social policy?	0.7483862163079058
The Danish pension scheme, the Efterløn, only allows people resident in Denmark and people who have completed the required period of employment in Denmark to retire.	0.7369496170690705
Some workers have complained to the European Commission because they do not have the right to retire.	0.9746845159244821
The Danish authorities do not consider that they are obliged under Community law to pay this compensation to workers taking early retirement who do not meet the conditions required under Danish law.	0.5875335702386436
It should be noted that the current regulation on social security systems does not at present refer to the question of early retirement and the Commission has proposed certain amendments to the regulation which are, however, still pending before the Council.	0.9688078090311403
There is, as yet, no European Court case law on Efterløn, but it could validly be argued that the residence requirement is incompatible with general clauses now in force banning discrimination on the grounds of nationality.	0.7283454799049974
The Commission services set up a procedure for joint meetings and discussions with the Danish Government with a view to finding a common language and a common approach.	0.7764364809520979
The last meeting on the subject was held in November 1999 and we are waiting for the Commission services' final proposals on whether or not infringement proceedings will be instituted against Denmark.	0.8607076209755833
I noticed that the Commissioner did not give a direct answer to the question of whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme as a whole has been approved by the Commission, but it was indirectly apparent that the answer was that it has not been.	0.905469119514073
I should like to ask the Commissioner expressly to confirm that the scheme has not been approved by the Commission.	0.8728099218272366
The Commissioner also more than hinted, of course, that a lot of consideration was being given to bringing the whole issue of the Danish early retirement pension scheme before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg, specifically on the grounds that the scheme actually discriminates against non-Danish wage earners who are unable to fulfil the conditions, due to the fact that they have not been in paid work for the period required under the Danish system.	0.779335710216522
I should like to ask the Commissioner if she can provide any approximate deadlines in connection with this matter, for it is a problem which needs clarification in the context of the Danish socio-political debate.	0.8356074838641365
So I should be grateful if the Commissioner could enlarge upon this question.	0.5688576854137758
Honourable Member, I should just like to stress that both Denmark and numerous other Member States are having problems interpreting the directives and transposing them into national law.	0.8201178863798064
This is one such case and discussions are under way between the Danish Government and the Commission in order to find the best possible solution to the matter, to the benefit of the workers who meet the requirements and who, as things stand, have a right to this pension.	1.046453013428511
Briefly, just to follow on from that last point, I invite the Commission to make it absolutely clear that the Commission's objections, such as they are, would not in any way infringe the rights of Danish nationals to benefit from this scheme, but simply that the Commission has a concern, which it has the right to have under Community law, to ensure that the scheme applies to all EU citizens who qualify.	1.1496178111381157
I think that the answer is brief and clear.	0.7503195781074131
Of course it is as you say.	0.6035174694022574
There will be no problem with Danish nationals within Denmark, that is not where the problem lies.	0.888859524942337
The problem is with Danish nationals or other nationals residing outside Denmark.	0.5448215135200261
Question No 37 by (H-0791/99):	0.16799536661647888
Subject: Working time directive Can the Commission say what action it proposes taking to ensure a level of protection, equivalent to that provided by the 1993 working time directive, for non-consultant hospital doctors, who were excluded from that directive and again from the proposal for a Council amending directive (COM(98)0662-C4-0715/98 - 98/0318(SYN))?	0.69326065247058
A proposal has been drafted for a directive to amend the directive on the working time of non-consultant hospital doctors.	0.7332846973333298
The content of the proposal concerns the average 48-hour working week of doctors, with the possibility, following negotiation, of increasing it to 54 hours.	0.8030401244824579
The Council, Commission and Parliament are all agreed on the content but there is disagreement on the transitional period for implementing the directive.	0.7411416708105484
Parliament has proposed 4 years, the Commission 7 and the Council 13.	0.9974581040929155
This proposal is still being discussed by the Council and Parliament on the basis of the codecision procedure.	0.9974261706359479
Although there is this disagreement, I should stress that all three institutions agree on the content and that every effort is being made to find a common approach to this particularly important and sensitive question which concerns an exceptionally large number of working doctors throughout Europe.	0.831360710093139
Question No 38 by (H-0805/99):	0.16979267179345445
Subject: Measures to advance gender equality One of the working groups of Commissioners announced by President Prodi has as its objective the promotion of measures to advance gender equality (gender mainstreaming).	0.6206591308606756
Which Commissioners are members of this group?	0.7351306645198068
How many meetings of the group have been held to date?	0.7276971893669336
What concrete measures have been discussed?	0.5083905493873558
This question covers several individual matters.	0.21706995992703568
It refers to the special Commission working group dealing with questions of equality.	0.46551901445145377
The Commissioners taking part are President Prodi, Vice-President Kinnock, Mr Reding and myself.	0.5718185345368041
The meetings of the working group are open and the first meeting was held on 11 January 2000.	0.7054381357348831
Three serious issues were discussed: the first was the first discussion on the fifth programme for women, of which I gave an initial evaluation, the second issue was the report by Mr Busquin on the investigation into the participation of women in research and science, and the third involved Mr Kinnock, who reported to the working group on efforts being made to take account of the gender equality dimension in the overall reforms currently taking place in the Community.	0.8905795920547318
Thank you very much, Commissioner, for your reply, although I regret the fact that this working group has taken so long to meet, since this matter is of the greatest importance.	1.0088542135047638
We trusted this Commission, from the outset, to begin work on all issues relating to greater equality for men and women.	0.7450845948816831
I hope that, in the future, things will change and meetings will become frequent, because there are many issues which require the attention of the Commission in order to speed up and conclude, as quickly as possible, those measures which will promote greater equality between men and women.	0.9130555349655898
Mrs Avilés-Perea, that was an exhortation rather than a question.	0.729234629762082
But if the Commissioner wishes to offer doctrine or good intentions ...	0.5541568565101793
Allow me to say just one word. I agree that the working group should have met earlier but at least, once it did, important decisions were taken straight away.	0.9235809647873009
Question No 39 by (H-0807/99):	0.16102888685393954
Subject: Community EQUAL initiative On 13 October 1999, the Commission adopted the Community's EQUAL initiative, the aim of which is transnational cooperation to find and develop new means of combating discrimination and inequalities in the labour market with the focus on asylum-seekers.	0.7953446224287769
Under this umbrella, each Member State is to submit proposals in the form of a Community initiative programme for that particular country.	0.8629899924275668
What criteria will the Commission use to approve or reject the Member States' programmes?	0.6738672031024978
Which Community body will control the funding of the steering group and the monitoring committee and verify that the programme is carried out exactly and correctly?	0.6613330065340504
The European Social Fund contribution for the period 2000-2006 will total 2 487 billion euro. As the EQUAL initiative is a joint funding venture with the Member States, what will Greece's contribution amount to?	0.7634893101700381
The EQUAL initiative is not restricted to certain groups of people.	0.5649083528944321
Its purpose is to combat discrimination in the workplace.	0.6167134483758303
The decision on this initiative was taken in Berlin, where it was decided to take account of professional groups of asylum seekers and to include them in its action.	0.8735650300705657
This is an important aspect of this initiative.	0.9923105754878176
The Community initiative programme in each Member State must comply with the regulation. This is the same as the Social Fund regulation, i.e. EQUAL comes under the Social Fund regulation.	1.0051724561646806
It has been submitted to Parliament and we expect Parliament' s opinion next month.	0.8740890554577663
I should like to stress that the EQUAL initiative satisfies national requirements and national plans defined in accordance with agreed European strategy.	0.6660002736876324
The Member States, i.e. the national governments, have primary responsibility for setting up the joint agencies, submitting proposals, selecting the proposals which the programmes will implement and carrying out primary control.	0.7203708143171214
Within the European Commission, the Directorate-General for Employment is responsible for implementation, while financial control is the responsibility of the Directorate-General for Financial Control, the Anti-Fraud Office and the European Court of Auditors.	0.9944294163334497
The last question concerns the amount granted.	0.4122224784145962
Greece has been granted ECU 98 million. The contribution commitment is 80%, rising to an 85% contribution from the initiative for the island regions, especially the remote Greek islands, and a contribution by Greece of 15%.	0.7914351921030908
Mr President, I feel that the guidelines for the Community EQUAL initiative, especially the four actions described in it, will result both in complicated bureaucracy and, paradoxically, a non-transparent structure.	0.9800970843459083
For example, one wonders how a development partnership will prove its cooperative spirit or its representative capacity, as required by action 2 in paragraph 33 of the guidelines.	0.6592312133400169
At the same time, the obligation to engage in transnational cooperation, the complicated demands of the plan and the implementation of a development partnership inevitably require large structures, as these are the only structures which can meet such demands.	0.860963074177672
However, this contradicts the stated aim of the general objectives for decentralised action plans at the level of local authorities and rural areas. However, at the same time, participation by those actually discriminated against, such as asylum seekers, immigrants and so on, is rendered impossible or merely symbolic.	0.7432726424512003
Finally, if you consider the overall amount, which is on the small side, - EUR 2.8 billion for 15 Member States - and how ambitious the objectives are, I am afraid that all we shall succeed in doing is to prove that unemployment is a bad thing.	0.9322999957976633
First let me say that it would be a great help to us, now that we have reached the stage where this is being processed by Parliament, if you could make specific proposals which we could take into account.	1.0213262090660853
Secondly, I have to say that the aim of the EQUAL initiative is not to reduce unemployment, it cannot possibly deal with the issue of reducing unemployment, or to support an increase in employment.	1.1827398825004565
That is the job of the European Strategy for Employment and the Social Fund, which have huge sums of money and exceptionally large resources at their disposal, especially for countries like Greece.	1.061155713191858
The EQUAL initiative has a specific mission. To encourage, to assist promotion, to create statistics, to create studies and agencies to support those sections of the population which suffer discrimination.	0.9527665015697179
So what we are looking for is cooperation between local groups, between local authorities and between countries in order to exchange experiences; that is mainly what we are looking for, and for experience to be transferred from one country to another so that it can be emulated.	0.9740527636819576
This is the philosophy behind the initiative; the budget is commensurate with it and our aim is for development agencies, non-governmental organisations and local authorities to be involved as much as possible, so that it can get as close to the people as possible.	0.9204447971946284
Question No 40 by (H-0808/99):	0.15436906514152016
Subject: Article 13 TEU and Employment The draft Commission Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation gives exemption to religious organisations (Art. 4.2).	0.5199332734665038
Could the Commission please tell Parliament the circumstances and the groups within Article 13 (TEU) likely to be effected by such an exemption?	0.5142342690704399
A month ago, the Commission submitted a proposal on equal treatment in employment, as prescribed in the Treaty, in order to implement Article 13.	0.9682429375473316
The ban on discrimination is the rule in the package of directives and programmes which we submitted.	0.5669940658971283
At the Commission' s proposal and after approximately two years of consultation with social agencies, Member States and the European Parliament, a number of exceptions have been made.	0.8226410074779253
These exceptions relate to professions which must be exercised by persons with a genuine professional qualification.	0.4847333710528469
Allow me to give you a specific example to illustrate this.	0.6595579123118678
In a religious school, it is logical for an exemption to be requested and accepted in order to ensure that the teacher is of the faith to which the religious school in question belongs.	0.7293642487433364
That is the sort of exemption we are talking about.	0.543038265956477
Clearly this is not a general exemption and the different approach which allow Member States to introduce special provisions are only justified in the case of this special professional qualification.	0.7358233588225028
This is a perverse interpretation of ending discrimination.	0.5401932969895851
For instance, religious schools could quite properly say to a Roman Catholic for example: we do not want to employ you because you are a gay man or because you are a lesbian.	0.6024803225939265
Here we have from the Commission a reinforcement of a hierarchy of oppression.	0.7530227464789061
Surely what we should be doing, and I hope you will agree, Commissioner, is engaging the person to do the job on the basis of their capability, and we should not enshrine such bigotry and prejudice, no matter how sincerely held.	0.9932181939687135
I must stress that this exemption is not a refusal of work for any reason, be it the reason which you mentioned, sexual orientation, ethnic discrimination or any other reason.	0.696478879678736
It allows a choice to be made only where special qualifications are needed which relate directly to the activity in question.	0.5482985605871323
In other words, it is positive discrimination.	0.6055677483480291
In the example which you mentioned, it is only logical that the teacher in a Catholic school should be Catholic.	0.6472850515843515
That is the only form of exemption which is acceptable.	0.7731138683849086
Question No 41 by (H-0813/99):	0.1644992637518153
Subject: Promoting jobs for women in severely less-favoured regions Given the enormous difficulties in obtaining work which women face in certain severely less-favoured regions, and given that these women very seldom have any resources to draw on, in terms of either finance, entrepreneurial or cooperative traditions or even training facilities, living as they do in rural districts where 80% of the population is on the poverty line, what measures or actions are planned to help these women overcome the hurdle of their social environment?	0.6701485189195221
Does the Commission intend to put forward lowest common denominator policies which will properly reflect the admittedly extreme but nonetheless real-life situation of these women, or will their plight once again be overlooked by the new employment policies?	0.6590014595037325
Obviously, the cohesion policy exists for less-favoured regions and cooperation and joint action by the Structural Funds, the Social Fund and the Agricultural Fund exist for the cohesion policy.	0.8553120697278425
I should point out that the funds available for regions with problems account for one third of the total budget.	0.6926471461778411
The aim of these regional policies, which, of course, are implemented under the jointly agreed European guidelines in each Member State, i.e. each Member State is responsible for implementing this programme, is to increase opportunities for work for both men and women.	0.8010508318422719
I should point out that 70% of funding for the period 2000-2006, i.e. EUR 195 billion, will go to the less-favoured regions of Europe.	0.6831863785897705
With particular reference now to the question of access by women to the opportunities which are created, I would like to say, first, that there is, via the Social Fund, an entire equal opportunities pillar which the Member States must implement, i.e. special policies for women which must use Social Fund resources.	0.8403692324020465
Secondly, the LEADER initiative currently being studied gives special priority to development strategies which aim to give special support to women in small enterprises in the agricultural sector and in rural tourism, with a view to increasing the involvement of women in agricultural regions.	0.7717319162639812
Commissioner, thank you for giving me a well-intentioned answer, which has been rigorous and well-argued.	0.8465475680858244
However, I can assure you that we do not, with the existing measures - which you have referred to - reach these severely less-favoured regions.	0.9768160599960889
They are areas where there is much need and we have to put them on an equal footing with those areas where we work in cooperation, where almost none exists.	0.9099943397604229
Therefore, my question is whether you could examine the possibility that some of the policies on microcredits, which have brought results in cooperation, could be applied to those women in severely less-favoured regions, who have the odds stacked against them.	0.9382298356136678
I am very familiar with the programmes which you refer to.	0.8920850971415685
I can assure you that we are not reaching the areas where there is most need.	0.9492885221574803
With these forecasts of the structural policy - which I know very well - and the forecasts of LEADER and rural development, we will not promote, as we should, employment amongst women in the severely less-favoured regions.	1.0922742178775233
I would therefore ask you to study the possibility of applying microcredit policies.	0.6407068559620267
Question No 42 by (H-0817/99):	0.16110209395234037
Subject: Commission's plans for presentation of a new social action programme It is important that the Commission present as soon as possible a new social action programme, setting out a specific plan with a timetable for implementation for both the legislative work in the area of social security and initiatives for framework agreements in the context of the 'social dialogue'.	0.7935075428989625
Can the Commission say what its precise intentions are regarding the presentation of a new social action programme?	0.6363427038976248
We estimate that the Commission' s new social action programme for the next five years will be ready at the end of this summer.	0.7474000255969435
In order to complete the programme and be able to present it, we first need to complete our consultations with Parliament, the social partners and non-governmental organisations.	0.881769242430916
These discussions have already started, but we will need to take account of the results in Lisbon.	1.0175196572841774
The Lisbon European Council is trying to take a new approach to the question of social exclusion and the link between social exclusion and the information society, economic policy and reforms.	0.881685669598982
These results will be most important in shaping the Commission' s social programme.	0.5079846540235603
I have already told the European Parliament that a joint meeting will be held in April between Parliament and the Commission, after the Lisbon conference, so that all aspects can be discussed and the social programme for 2000-2006 can finally be drafted.	0.8915133661230868
Clearly, any future social action programme should take account of developments, for example within information technology, and, in time, become a modern social action programme.	0.8717192745089721
But can you also provide confirmation concerning the matter I raise in my question, namely that the programme will be designed in such a way that we shall obtain a concrete timetable for the various types of legislation in the social sphere which the Commission is planning, as well as for those initiatives which the Commission is planning with regard to dialogue between the two sides of industry?	0.9562943961955702
We need to see which concrete alternatives the Commission will adopt during the coming period and which initiatives it will take for the purpose of reaching agreements.	0.7549829804506605
Firstly, I agree with you entirely. Account will be taken of the information society; that was something which I too mentioned.	1.0032127202386218
Social exclusion, the programme for women, the efforts we are making in the social protection area, everything needs to be looked at now in the light of the new reality of the information society.	1.0230910949285477
Secondly, there will obviously be timetables for the initiatives within which systematic monitoring will also have to be implemented.	0.9149882138667689
Where I cannot commit myself is on your reference to legislative work in the social security area which, as you know, is not included in the articles of the Treaty and there is no legal basis for social security questions in the Treaty.	0.9481607819493038
Question No 44 by (H-0819/99):	0.1610288766506922
Subject: Opportunities of the disabled to take advantage of freedom of movement within the EU Under Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty, it should be possible for all EU citizens to take advantage of freedom of movement within the Union.	0.7209799168813117
However, for people with various kinds of physical disability who are in need of special transport and personal assistance, freedom of movement is still highly restricted.	0.8111083939687777
What measures is the Commission taking to facilitate opportunities for the disabled in this area?	0.8243026728495555
On 26 November 1999, the European Commission approved a package of measures to combat discrimination.	1.0329283553045865
As far as the package in question and people with special needs are concerned, there is a directive which concentrates on combating discrimination, especially in the workplace.	0.8642835681872082
The European Commission believes that this initiative to combat discrimination will help to increase the level of employment of people with special needs and, in the end, to promote the freedom of movement of these persons.	1.1216687576069795
Of course, it is particularly important for people with special needs to have access to means of transport, services and all types of installation if they are to exercise their right to freedom of movement.	0.7432675238292371
The European Commission has approved a proposal for a directive on special arrangements in buses, coaches and other vehicles, so that people with special needs with mobility problems and people using wheelchairs have access to them.	0.6680523109197417
In addition, you should know that, on 4 June 1998, the Council approved the recommendation for a pan-European type of parking permit to be introduced for people with special needs, the aim of which is to help them travel in all Member States with a common permit so that they can take advantage of all organised parking areas throughout Europe.	0.9261076871040519
I would thank the Commissioner for her answer.	0.6956560707555296
My question in the first place concerns the opportunities the disabled have to take advantage of freedom of movement in Europe.	0.7148767189788224
It is quite an expensive business if you are to travel from Gothenburg to somewhere else in Europe on holiday or on a study visit if you are in a wheelchair and also need to have a personal assistant or carer with you in order to manage.	0.7419693361533596
I am grateful for the fact that the Commission has adopted an action plan.	0.9478445475779834
It is of course a prerequisite, however, that there be financial resources and means of actually crossing the borders physically if you have a disability.	0.8512634945963929
It would be interesting to hear whether the Commission is also prepared to set aside financial resources for those who have disabilities, so that they too might venture further out into the world than merely to where their wheelchairs take them.	0.8356999029228874
I referred to the directive which the Commission has proposed on compulsory arrangements for means of public transport, so that people with special needs can use them.	0.8569592285397267
It has not yet been passed by the Council; it is at the consultation stage.	1.091229499306718
I think that a strategic decision of this sort can be taken at European level.	0.9346876122745307
I think it is exceptionally difficult for us to specialise in aid programmes for personal transport.	0.5297512864390851
That is dealt with either under special programmes in education, for young people, for women and for exchanges or must be a matter for national policy.	0.8500061615782795
Question No 45 by (H-0006/00):	0.25192590339543214
Subject: Compliance with Directive 96/71/EC concerning the posting of workers The posting of workers directive has still not been implemented in Denmark, even though the deadline has passed.	0.6069031783584116
The draft legislation before the Folketing does not contain any rules governing rights of employed persons under collective agreements.	0.40983622328468305
Pursuant to Article 3(8) of the Directive, terms and conditions of employment must be in keeping with the 'collective agreements which have been concluded by the most representative employers' and labour organisations at national level and which are applied throughout national territory'.	0.7170245809454521
However, such use of an agreement outside its specific scope cannot be imposed on the two sides of industry without a legal basis.	0.7766982344736797
There are therefore two possible solutions: either the Directive is inapplicable in Denmark, or Denmark is required by the Directive to introduce universally applicable agreements.	0.7056632832635862
Can the Commission confirm that the Directive concerning the posting of workers is inapplicable in Denmark as far as 'collective agreements ... declared universally applicable' (cf. Article 3(1)) are concerned, given that such universally applicable agreements do not exist under Danish law?	0.7340821007670943
If not, will it explain how the Directive is to be complied with in this area?	1.1076578276617508
The European Union posting of workers directive stipulates that the compulsory rules concerning the terms and conditions of employment applicable in the host country must also apply to workers posted to that country.	0.6462530538989082
What it says it that one of two things may apply, i.e. either the legislation in the host country or the collective agreements which have been declared to be the rules universally applicable to a specific sector.	0.7309194677343935
Because Denmark does not have a system for declaring collective agreements to be universally applicable rules, provision must be made in the implementing legislation so that, apart from current conditions of employment stipulated in legislation, the hours in universally applicable collective agreements, concluded by the most representative organisations, also apply to posted workers.	0.7207102806277615
In other words, to put it simply, Denmark has a choice: it can either introduce legislation or it can use the legislative process to choose a collective agreement and legally activate it.	0.7868148503391642
Discussions are being held between the European Commission and Denmark, and Denmark is expected to notify the Commission of the transposition of this directive into its national legislation.	0.9132066500321624
The deadline by which it had to answer the Commission' s questions expired on 6 December 1999 and we have not received a reply.	0.8386043440616587
We are waiting to see what the next move will be.	0.6361030912043423
Thank you for a very clear answer, the gist of which - if the interpretation is correct - is that the posting of workers directive entails an obligation on the part of the Danish state to establish a system of universally applicable agreements.	0.9542493678803601
It is a very clear answer, but it is also an answer, may I point out, which puts Danish organisations, the Danish Government and the Danish Parliament in a very, very difficult situation politically, for it is a well-known fact that there are a number of basic problems associated with the relationship between the Danish model, which is based quite obviously upon collective agreements, and the Continental model, which presupposes legislation.	1.0986604866137426
The disagreement and the correspondence to which you refer, Commissioner, concern, first and foremost, another directive, namely the working time directive, but now we can foresee another letter of formal notice and further Treaty infringement proceedings looming because the Danish Government does not intend, or has expressly stated that it does not wish, to implement legislation and establish universally applicable agreements.	0.7345199664151776
Firstly, no attempt is being made to change the system in Denmark or in any other country.	0.8683893907658927
As I said earlier, there are always problems interpreting the directives of the European Commission both because they have a very general framework and because systems are very different from one country to another.	0.8976492988784199
As far as your question is concerned, this problem does not only apply to Denmark. It is not only Denmark which has matters pending.	0.8693016276238916
Five countries have transposed this into national legislation and the rest are at the discussion stage.	0.5890373081766851
What now needs to be done, and this was the reason for the consultations and discussions between the Commission and the Danish Government, and with other governments, is to find the best way forward, so that something which is decided at European level by all the Member States, and which constitutes a general framework, can also include workers posted to Denmark from other countries.	1.0874636524459274
And this is the direction in which we expect the Danish and the other nine governments to move.	0.9220549629130003
Thank you very much, Commissioner, for your dedication.	0.712413886089014
You have fulfilled your objective for today, which is to answer all the questions.	0.8533524831235867
We congratulate you.	0.13977084573716334
Since the time allocated to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions 46 to 68 will be replied to in writing.	0.6276251216579182
That concludes Question Time.	0.08907304895423734

1997 discharge	-0.0
The next item is the report (A5-0004/2000) by Mrs van der Laan, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on giving discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Communities for the 1997 financial year (Section I - Parliament, II - Council, III - Commission, IV - Court of Justice and V - Court of Auditors) [SEC(1998) 520 - C4-0350/1998, SEC(1998) 522 - C4-0351/1998, SEC(1998) 519 - C4-0352/1999]	0.7085289608018878
The Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, is not here yet, but I hope, and expect, that she will arrive in the next few minutes.	1.1936693979795532
Nevertheless, I recommend that we start, in the hope that the Commissioner will be able to follow the debate, and particularly the rapporteur' s speech, from her office, if that is where she still is.	1.087977066598934
Mr President, I am sure that Mrs Schreyer must have a very good reason for not being here because her absence would be inexcusable otherwise.	0.875296932565635
I would like to start by thanking my colleagues for their cooperation on this report, it would not be what it is today without that spirit of cooperation.	0.8803958163359744
Mr President, early last year, the 1997 discharge was postponed because this Parliament could not possibly grant discharge to a resigning Commission which could not enter into any commitments for the future.	0.6390930604658495
In its resolution, this Parliament stated that discharge could not be granted until we had received serious, far-reaching proposals for reform from the new European Commission.	0.8502456826966146
This report, therefore, appears at a crucial time, on the eve of Mr Kinnock' s reforms.	0.615013176764469
It is an excellent opportunity for this Parliament to introduce far-reaching reforms to these plans.	0.9313583223888418
In the period leading up to this, it already appeared, on the basis of the initial drafts, that the Commission had made very important pledges.	0.9816277750567212
We asked for a whistle-blower' s regulation, and this is now in place.	0.8504857178823644
Parliament wanted financial inspection and audit functions to be separated.	0.3496773444074451
This has now been done.	0.4854749260021946
Parliament requires a code of conduct for Commissioners and Cabinets.	0.41474999264044216
This is in place too.	0.8330878312515854
Parliament asked the Commission to waive its excessive privileges.	0.6144277264075753
It did this as well.	0.4203337252639845
The Commission has also entered into commitments to cooperate with Parliament in terms of SEM 2000.	0.7384983161888441
Fundamental changes will also be considered for the technical assistance offices.	0.6030783066758078
These are sound, first steps which illustrate that, if this Parliament so wishes, changes are not only possible but can also be translated into action quickly.	0.874815131642398
We want more than that, however.	0.874677855257699
The Commission should now produce an ambitious and far-reaching reform programme.	0.7287968369625917
This is not only necessary for proper public administration, it is a conditio sine qua non of regaining the trust of the European citizen.	0.9337115465584047
We now demand from the European Commission clear pledges concerning the following points.	0.7981642040546014
Firstly, Parliament must have complete access to all Commission documents.	0.7901542791809081
This, however, presupposes that we set up an internal scheme quickly in order to be able to guarantee the confidentiality of sensitive documents.	0.675285409637272
In the context of providing information, I would like to draw the Commission' s attention to the fact that we are very concerned about the present draft plans on public access to documents.	0.8115140452388222
If the current draft is correct, then this is a huge step backwards in comparison to today.	0.8576614498914805
We must put an end to the situation in which financially powerful organisations with representation in Brussels are able to access information whilst the ordinary citizen is not.	0.6288120274724416
Neither can we tolerate a situation in which a public body holds the copyright to public documents.	0.5765897419732403
We would also like a clear job description for each European official so that an official with conscientious objections can more easily object to tasks which are unethical or unlawful.	0.5636055529888928
Furthermore, it should be the case that, if the Court of Auditors detects a mistake not just one year but two years running, the management should be held responsible for it, and this will have an effect on chances of promotion.	1.0502944520104998
Ultimately, we also need to achieve better cooperation, of course, between the European Court of Auditors and its national counterparts.	0.9845610360792278
This Parliament has also asked the Commission to give an initial outline of the external aid policy reforms on 31 March of this year.	0.8115719701028585
It should no longer be the case that, although Europe is an economic power, we have no political influence because, when the chips are down, we cannot offer effective aid to areas which desperately need it.	1.075515545964652
I would quote Gaza as an example.	0.5231794659903505
It is unacceptable that the Commission completed the construction of a hospital in 1996 and that, as yet, it has been left unused.	1.0599875573249016
Mr President, since 1996, the discharge has acquired a heavy, political significance.	0.8452713595067047
It is one of the most powerful weapons Parliament has and must therefore be deployed with care.	0.7550432687676523
This is why we will most probably grant the discharge tomorrow.	0.6381670480097683
However, we are not surrendering this weapon without placing a time bomb in its place.	0.724498041034699
Indeed, the 1999 discharge will not be given until all financial irregularities highlighted by the Court of Auditors have been cleared up.	0.7781871448630487
Finally, this discharge report is naturally addressed to the Commission. But this does not detract from the fact that the European Parliament should also put its own house in order.	1.0216528672298542
As long as we have no status, we are not credible as a force for reforming the Union. The reforms of the European institutions are necessary in order to be able to continue Europe' s development process.	1.1403803387452436
We cannot have a decisive and fair Europe unless it is also open and democratic.	0.6456332828483229
All institutions must now join forces in order to work together towards building this type of Europe.	0.6830239824249099
Mr President, the Committee on Industry decided to go ahead and draw up a report on the discharge for 1997 although we were not specifically asked to do so.	0.9113657538051049
We went ahead because we felt we should start this Parliament in the way in which we mean to go on, that is, by making sure that we take good care of taxpayers' money in Europe.	0.9152746918977568
During the course of our work on this report it became clear that there are persistent problems in the spending areas under the control of our budget.	0.8708608706856135
They were not unique to 1997 and two strands seem to run through them.	0.4328884950200408
The first is a tendency for the Commission to embark on very ambitious programmes, particularly in third countries, without sufficient assessment of the practicalities of implementation and proper resourcing.	0.871945679145768
The second involves serious managerial shortcomings in the Commission, in particular in relation to coordination across departments and management of external contracts.	0.7844525624433074
I know that all the Institutions bear some responsibility for the increasing workload of the Commission and for some of the lack of resources.	0.998736351381979
That cannot excuse everything that we came across.	0.36046560505877473
Citizens of Europe expect the European institutions to be properly managed and they are right to do so.	0.9970003801862211
That is why I want to echo the comments from my colleague about the importance of the reform process which has been promised to the people of Europe by Mr Prodi and Mr Kinnock.	0.9543575126099269
From what I have seen of the reform process, it looks good.	1.1831478075030482
I saw some of Mr Kinnock's papers today, I heard some of what he had to say.	0.8152601737889252
I have every confidence that if we and the politicians of Europe support him we will see the kind of reform we need.	0.6943541357049193
But we need that reform process.	0.6964956762448287
Many of the general points raised in our committee's report have been covered in Mrs van der Laan's report.	0.6175310225776319
It is an excellent report and we should all congratulate her on it.	1.0946014165079418
It seems to hit on all the right points without just being like some of the old reports, a series of details.	0.7072351633457528
It groups them together and that is very important.	0.8631489547142877
There are two issues I would like to draw your attention to.	0.6325930610225605
One is nuclear safety in Eastern Europe.	0.3822204484021969
We have to get this right.	0.7310748744566432
The Committee of Independent Experts said the Commission was not managing this properly.	0.5986792658672753
We have to remedy that.	0.6901123384266009
The second point is about scrutiny mechanisms.	0.5556680388625928
We need from the Commission material we can use to help us scrutinise spending.	0.745772647382166
We need proper information, given in a proper way and we all have to take this whole process a lot more seriously than in the past.	0.9345938779258648
It has been seen as a bureaucratic process to be done as quickly as possible in as little time as possible.	0.7976585209796891
I hope colleagues in this House will support the grounds for discharge for 1997 and, at the same time, that the Commission will push ahead with the reform process which is long overdue.	0.9950290989802539
Only in this way can we create a new culture in the Commission and at the same time get public confidence restored.	0.9973624149294563
Mr President, I am sure the Commission will be relieved to hear that the 97 discharge is unlikely to have the same impact as the 96 discharge which, as you are all so very well aware, led to the forced resignation of the Santer Commission.	0.9201361333583336
The Socialist Group will be voting to grant discharge.	0.6665220708263284
I am sure you will be relieved to hear that as well.	0.7691079288492157
But that is not to say that we are satisfied, and that everything in the garden is rosy.	1.1482325747359667
It is clear that a radical overhaul of the Commission is long overdue.	0.9227600238114783
It indicates, however, that we acknowledge that steps are being made in the right direction.	0.832208734694154
I just want to outline some of the issues that we, as Socialists, have put down as amendments.	0.87023570399872
We hope these will be carried because they are important in the way that they will impact on future reform.	0.9351262784128326
First of all, the immunity of officials: this should be lifted if and when requested by a national prosecutor.	0.7799018902880036
We need to make it much easier to prosecute officials who are guilty of fraud and corruption.	0.7619339251640821
It is critical to note that the Commission has too often failed to act on the reforms recommended by the Court of Auditors.	0.8266603834188615
The Court's report is there for a reason, our response to it is there for a reason and it is important that it is followed through.	0.9298128971652201
I have just heard now that an audit progress board is going to be set up by the Commission.	0.8792706781854719
Even if we hear nothing else, we know that is going in the right direction in terms of the reforms that we want to see.	0.9638048632865345
Too often we have put forward recommendations and they have not been acted upon even though you have said very often that you will act on them.	0.8451506823511898
We want to see that follow-through to a much greater extent in future.	0.8694072474752332
The other issue is access to confidential documents.	0.2948345800897417
We have had problems in the past in terms of our responsibility in carrying out discharge because we have not had access to the documents we should have had.	1.0980968627169116
We understand that we also have a responsibility here, that if we are given documents we must ensure that confidential documents will indeed be kept confidential.	0.9634272465069756
We have put down an amendment to that effect.	0.6843476623227621
One issue which is referred to in the van der Laan report is the whole question of the Gaza hospital.	0.8050357228081731
The situation there is totally unacceptable.	0.47861477656077195
We will not put up with it for much longer and we are looking for immediate action on that issue.	0.7835489653831031
I would like to congratulate Lousewies van der Laan.	0.6644624887681982
I do not usually bother congratulating people but I think she has produced a very cogent report and deserves our thanks.	0.6493805346800235
Mr President, Commissioner, if we are honest, we find ourselves in a somewhat unusual situation.	0.9169218730214012
We are discussing last year' s discharge, but also the Commission' s responsibility.	0.983726054759593
I would like to raise the problems which are still piled up high on our desks.	0.8020913653503041
The assessment of whether or not the discharge will be granted also depends to some extent on where the emphasis is placed.	0.6590896781335563
It is about a Commission which is no more.	1.0155387123264403
There is now a new Commission.	0.7470583026122413
Then it is logical to grant discharge, because how can the current Commissioner be blamed where 1997 is concerned?	0.742931253165721
The problems remain and this gives rise to doubts.	0.3304121725031329
We have to take a decision now regarding the Commission' s good intentions, but there is still no structural outline for these good intentions.	0.9035853307071823
Mr Kinnock will present his proposal next month.	0.32946024175112165
We are all very much anticipating this, but the facts are still missing at this time when we already have to decide whether or not to grant discharge.	1.0528087515239153
It is clearly a dilemma with which the rapporteur has also struggled.	0.9928319832275392
This dilemma stretches beyond the areas which I have already listed.	0.7346387679224903
Take, for example, the pledges made by the Commission. They look good in themselves.	1.000986907154918
I have read a few documents written by Mr Kinnock and we have every confidence in them.	0.709280539436505
But I will give two examples from which it is not as evident that the good intentions which the Commission has now expressed will lead to a good outcome: the public nature and confidentiality of documents.	0.9896360696399403
The previous speaker already said something about this.	0.5534693761589552
A document is circulating at the moment - not at a low level, but at a high level within the Commission - which, instead of enhancing the public nature of documents, is having the opposite effect.	0.9442965901130138
This is an illustration of empty pledges not necessarily leading to good results.	0.536756185360271
This also applies to whistle-blowers.	0.43581486597508096
Mr Kinnock has also devoted some fine-sounding phrases to this subject but, at the same time, it is entirely unclear, at this moment when we have to make a decision, what, for example, happens with whistle-blowers who want to get something off their chest and cannot do this internally but who want to address the outside world - the press or Parliament.	0.850409067819642
We have still not had a response to crucial questions of this type.	0.5881227731067511
So there is doubt as to whether these pledges of the Commission contain enough substance at this crucial time when decisions need to be made.	0.7601121280888126
This also applies, for example, to the very real projects which the Committee on Industry has introduced.	1.0148289427044548
In my opinion, the Commission and Mr Kinnock should come with good intentions and with sound plans on personnel policy and financial management, but each Commissioner who is now responsible for an area which has had serious shortcomings in the past should come with sound plans in order to improve the situation and not with general, empty proposals.	0.8952659985862728
At the moment, our group still feels sympathy for, and patience with, the Commission because it cannot be held responsible for a large proportion of the mistakes made in the past, but this patience has a limit.	0.9929279538470791
Clear progress must be visible.	0.1383227024316522
At present, we trust that the Commission will produce these sound proposals, but it is not a foregone conclusion that it will do so.	1.1568551562774536
Finally, Mr President, the 1996 discharge was the beginning of the end of the last Commission.	0.9127939417006361
I express the hope that - in fact, I urge the present Commission to ensure that - the 1997 discharge is the beginning of a true reform of financial policy by the Commission. Otherwise this discharge will not have been of any value.	1.039094827079509
In assessing the question of whether or not to grant the Commission discharge, the decision must be based upon what actually occurred during the financial year concerned, in this case in the course of 1997.	0.9337940838399023
In our Group, we find it hard to see how the financial administration for 1997 was in any crucial way better than that for 1996.	0.7758963930667591
In that year, we voted against granting discharge.	0.8568864775672357
As a result, we shall vote against granting discharge for 1997, too.	0.929548057362947
We think that this picture of ours is confirmed by the examination carried out by the Court of Auditors.	0.7606851351594754
It is both good and necessary that reforms have been promised.	0.4288378487102049
So far, the promises which have been made are still, however, to be fulfilled, especially where transparency is concerned.	1.009761360792124
We are therefore going to vote in favour of the demands for reforms which are presented in the resolution, but against the granting of discharge.	0.8142501716924321
Mr President, first of all, I have only positive comments to make on Mrs Van der Laan' s very expert work on this report.	0.7694087817621532
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group cannot vote for approving the accounts for 1997.	0.46432116586498795
The report on so-called discharge contains a comprehensive and extremely critical survey of the accounts.	0.6284248943728847
We support these critical remarks, and I must therefore state that it would seem quite absurd, against this background, to vote in favour of approving the accounts.	0.874123283259796
It has not been possible for the Court of Auditors to issue an auditor' s statement to the effect that the arrangements covered by the accounts are lawful, and we should regard it as extremely problematic if we, as Members of this Parliament, were to vote in favour of accounts without having any guarantee of the legality of the arrangements concerned.	0.8038388417772673
The majority have made their approval of the accounts conditional upon the new Commission' s implementing a series of reforms, so as to ensure that what we are familiar with from the previous Commission' s period of office is not repeated.	0.7304133823864973
Again, I must say that we are concerned here with an extremely unfortunate confusion of the old Commission' s accountability for 1997 and the new Commission' s accountability for the future.	0.9539645924918323
We do not think that the new Commission, under any circumstances, could incur liability for the past.	1.1040298637546697
We think it is wrong to talk about the Commission' s liability as an institution.	0.7983259023491834
The mistakes up until 1999 are attributable to those who had responsibility at that time, and we still have no way of knowing whether the new Commission can do any better.	0.8542186950198984
By means of this extraordinary procedure, Parliament is stopping itself from placing liability for the arrangements in 1997 squarely where it belongs, namely with the previous Commission.	0.7361824517216077
It was the 1996 accounts which led to the downfall of the previous Commission, and the 1997 accounts are just as incriminating.	0.906725477855893
There is no reason why, against this background, we should agree to grant discharge.	0.9148552214153413
As far as the decision to balance the accounts is concerned, we shall abstain from voting, and where, finally, the motion for a resolution is concerned, we shall attach most importance to the many correct instructions contained in this and vote in favour of it.	0.9766481415799737
Mr President, the decision relating to discharge for the 1997 financial year was postponed because the erstwhile Commission, to whom it was to be granted, had stepped down before the appointed time and was only continuing in office in a caretaker capacity.	0.7547277047805034
Mrs van der Laan' s report - on which she has lavished a great deal of hard work, and for which we are indebted to her - proposes that we should grant discharge to the Commission for 1997.	1.0168819010965746
One might ask how it is that the current Commission is to receive the discharge for its predecessor' s budgetary management - Mr Camre just mentioned this - particularly as the discharge for the previous year, 1996, was denied.	0.9185408774147695
That is just the way things are, however.	0.7899995921764595
In taking over the mandate, the new Commission has to assume responsibility not just for the achievements of the past but also for the mistakes made.	1.0279882438634158
Since, on account of the college system, discharge can only be granted to the Commission as a whole or, alternatively, denied or postponed, it is no longer of any consequence that four former Commissioners who belonged to the previous Commission that has yet to be discharged, crop up again as Members of this body.	0.8014673037559158
This question ought to have been asked when the new Commission was appointed.	0.9359706641574354
If Parliament votes in favour of the Committee on Budgetary Control' s proposal this week and grants discharge, then the Commission must not take this to be a blank cheque.	1.036040457672291
For it is the third section of Mrs van der Laan' s report that is the most important, to my mind, namely the motion for a resolution.	0.992510447104962
The comments contained within, under eight headings, are an integral part of the discharge, the implementation of which forms the basis of our decision.	0.8310494333497049
In the course of the discharge procedure for the coming years - that for 1998 is already under way - Parliament will have to examine, as a matter of urgency, whether or not it was too quick to bestow premature praise on the Commission for 1997.	0.9418239944218957
We will be in a position to judge just as soon as the Commission presents its reform programme.	0.8284104807391749
We will be able to use the discharge procedure for 1998 to check whether efficiency, transparency and accountability, and likewise a sincere willingness to provide information, are being displayed vis-à-vis the discharge authority.	0.7708399580644438
Mr President, we all recall that Parliament decided to postpone the discharge for the 1997 financial year pending commitments from the new European Commission regarding internal reform.	0.7462044269063279
In response to this the Commission has entered into various commitments and has certainly adopted many reform measures.	0.7033126604990761
It is fair to say that the new President, Mr Prodi, and his team are certainly committed to implementing the financial control requirements as laid down by this Parliament.	0.9508183510663786
However, the reform of the European Commission must now be taken in the context of the debate that is going to take place in the run-up to the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and the reform of various EU policies and initiatives.	1.0986978940793295
Existing EU treaties will be amended so as to ensure, for example, that the enlargement process can succeed.	0.7704506438134161
I have no doubt further reform of EU institutions will be analysed in this debate.	0.6449052829183421
But from the perspective of small Member States it is important that, as the European Commission is reformed, it must be done in a way that ensures that small Member States continue to have representation on the Commission.	1.005778452027898
Mr President, the Commission is now to obtain its discharge for 1997, but in reality it does not deserve it.	1.0154690539877385
1997 was a matter for the old Commission and, therefore, the new Commission does not think that it can accept liability.	1.0752893670831627
It is true that implementation of the Budget for 1997 fell within the old Commission' s remit. The new Commission has, on the other hand, undertaken to carry out a cleaning up exercise following former scandals, and I must admit that I am not impressed at all.	0.9333712773151602
The old mindset which involved sweeping things under the carpet and protecting one' s friends unfortunately still exists.	0.37598890746052704
There are some who think that it is more in our interests to let bygones be bygones and make a fresh start. I do not, however, think we can make a fresh start if we do not tidy things up properly.	0.8288008086248255
I am referring here especially to the earlier scandals involving ECHO.	0.5370324947303748
I am very indignant about the fact that it is so difficult to get any documents handed over on this matter.	0.7689822307736297
I am the rapporteur for ECHO on the Committee on Budgetary Control, and I shall have a lot of difficulty carrying out my work if the Commission will not give me the necessary information.	1.0254944102865289
From the outside, it looks as if the Commission has something to hide.	1.0583442531652425
My investigations also unfortunately suggest that this could be the case.	0.5427804653255
The Commission is not putting all its cards on the table and is in that way repeating ancient practice on the part of the Commission.	0.7625030196579524
It was this practice which led to the Commission' s downfall.	0.6960224716373684
I can therefore fully support the demand to give Parliament unconditional right of access to documents. Otherwise, we cannot carry out our work.	0.818584957024256
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.	0.7451878499652116
The debate is closed.	0.04146649521247962
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	0.15701726649154044
Response to Second Report of Committee of Independent Experts	0.4475705329908501
The next item is the report (A5-0001/2000) by Mr van Hulten, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on action to be taken on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on reform of the Commission.	0.7433154231286395
Mr President, this time last year the European Parliament set up a committee of independent experts chaired by Mr Middelhoek to investigate allegations of fraud, nepotism and corruption in the European Commission.	0.8813551974193121
On 15 March the committee published its first report concluding that: "It is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of responsibility".	0.6069983190526534
Within a few hours of the presentation of the report President Santer announced the resignation of his entire team.	0.6848431622006722
The resignation marked the end of a bitter struggle between an increasingly confident Parliament and a European Commission mired in allegations of scandal.	0.5640515193248262
Since then the Brussels landscape has changed beyond recognition; a new, reinvigorated Parliament has been elected and a new Commission confirmed in office.	0.6952965673131913
Speaking in this House on 21 July President-designate Prodi undertook to take full account of the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on Commission reform, which contains 90 detailed recommendations and which we are debating today.	0.8415970283230413
The new Commission has already taken important steps to move away from the way it used to function.	0.7978032305688657
A code of conduct for Commissioners and their private offices has been adopted.	0.47027941697773973
In a symbolic but significant gesture Commissioners have voluntarily renounced their entitlement to the tax-free purchase of alcohol, tobacco, petrol and consumer goods.	0.39873976074609274
New rules have been drawn up and implemented governing the appointment of senior officials.	0.5040766778923244
The number of departments has been reduced.	0.4137535603138217
The Commission, in my opinion, has shown a clear and unprecedented commitment to change and for this they are to be congratulated.	0.8790119203607661
The overall aim of the reforms must be to create a strong, honest European public administration equipped to carry out its tasks in an effective and efficient manner; an administration in which officials are provided with the means to carry out their tasks and are held fully accountable at all levels; an administration that recognises and rewards merit and encourages officials to develop their full potential.	0.7625140918441307
In order to achieve this, action is required in four areas.	0.8264909161149196
First, financial management and control within the Commission must be improved.	0.9993486870920726
One of the main problems is the lack of a functioning system of financial control.	0.7040522633522491
The Commission's DGs must be made fully responsible for their own expenditure, including financial control.	0.9476871400981206
A new independent audit system service must be set up.	0.543819722732252
DGs must publish their own annual accounts so as to enable a clear identification of problem areas and set annual targets for reducing fraud and irregularities.	0.47362085728951586
In return for this greater degree of autonomy, managers must be made fully and personally responsible for their actions.	0.5449029278162724
It is clear that the transition to such a new system will take time.	0.7587250628455676
Changes to the Financial Regulation will be required and Parliament must have its say on those changes.	0.8000389794333167
But while the Commission must ensure that it respects the Treaty and the Financial Regulation in the transitional phase, this must not be an excuse for inertia.	1.2190523154313773
Urgent change is required today.	0.3116906404566599
Second, the fight against fraud, mismanagement and nepotism must be strengthened, firstly by creating a culture in which they cannot thrive.	0.822548260542101
This requires a clear example to be set by Commissioners and senior staff as well as adequate training and secondly, by reinforcing the existing mechanisms for dealing with fraud.	0.7084062030152899
OLAF, the Commission agency set up earlier this year must be placed under the direction of an independent European public prosecutor whose job will be to prepare for prosecution by national criminal courts, criminal offences committed against the financial interests of the Union by Members and officials of the European institutions.	0.8758328689328189
A proposal can be made, a proposal should be made, on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty, by the middle of this year.	0.9935547721917901
Third, standards in European public life must be upheld.	0.4832450424608203
The political crisis which led to the downfall of the Commission earlier this year clearly demonstrated the need for unambiguous and enforceable rules of conduct.	0.6855414852968621
A number of codes have since been introduced.	0.35703331997337384
They must be assessed by Parliament and should be made legally binding.	0.8142394246465842
The European institutions should follow the example of a number of countries, most notably the United Kingdom, and institute a committee for standards in public life, with a mandate to give advice on professional ethics and rules of conduct in the European institutions.	0.9175648609499565
Whistle-blowers who act in good faith must be protected.	0.47035240086450125
At the end of last year Mr Kinnock announced new measures for the protection of whistle-blowers.	0.5521810666643386
They must be implemented without delay.	0.5276047583854943
Although such measures can never be an alternative for good management, they must be an escape valve when something goes wrong.	0.7494609902923016
Crucially, reforms must not be limited to the Commission.	0.7667914668311199
Parliament must consider itself the need for improvements to its internal rules, administrative procedures and management practices.	0.49653474675147385
Finally, the Commission's human resource policy must be modernised.	1.1339626431620344
It is clearly no longer suited to the requirements of a modern, multinational organisation.	0.6926880740216255
The social dialogue has often acted as a brake on reform and its overhaul is long overdue.	0.44806079009485866
A career with the European institutions must become more attractive.	0.948918412264793
Too many young, new officials are leaving their jobs after just a few years.	0.6376955811072332
Merit must be recognised and rewarded, specific skills training should be a sine qua non for promotion to a higher grade.	0.6358067988505108
The promotions procedure must be made fairer and more transparent.	0.4823308597302373
Last but not least the pay and benefits package must be reviewed.	0.4232019902845688
It must become more flexible and more responsible to labour market conditions.	0.5449179865938777
It must be rid of some of its more outdated elements; and it must deal with the legitimate concerns of the general public who cannot understand why European civil servants should be paid an expatriation allowance indefinitely in a Europe of open borders, or pay a level of taxes that is often well below that of Member States.	0.8237372430278801
Commissioner Kinnock will, tomorrow, present his communication on reform.	0.5521807927680553
This communication must contain a clear timetable.	0.32486584185543094
With a new Commission and a new Parliament up and running the momentum for reform is now as strong as it ever has been and probably ever will be.	0.6059985566697593
Enlargement of the Union is just a few years away.	1.2290776982348868
Now is the time for Europe to put its own house in order; to instil in its institutions - as the independent experts might have said - a sense of responsibility.	0.8869839877802258
In June of last year Europe's voters gave a clear signal that they are fed up with endless stories about mismanagement and nepotism.	0.4876398296018373
There is a very simple way to deal with those stories.	0.8756422378885427
Let us get rid of mismanagement and nepotism.	0.41867288842404077
Mr President, I do not want to be misunderstood - I sincerely hope this does not happen - and I should therefore like to start by saying that I am, of course, in favour of combating fraud and firmly support the appropriate, necessary reforms.	0.9375320854002283
This is not a straightforward issue and calls for a much more wide-ranging analysis, but I shall restrict myself to raising only a few points, in order to make people more aware, if possible, of what we are talking about.	1.0483976604725056
All the experts can provide information and news, formulate opinions and give advice, but, they have no political or elective responsibility, and rightly so.	0.7969375628453216
I nevertheless believe that politicians should look into what can be gleaned from an expert report and what cannot be taken en masse in a spirit which, on some occasions, I have felt in the past and still feel to be self-destructive.	0.8124762431624536
I believe - and I shall only pick up on a few ideas - that Parliament alone, and no one else, can exert an influence over its Members. If this were not the case, the European Parliament' s authority and representativeness would be seriously undermined in the coming years, and this institution would not move forward, as it should.	1.0624218500958282
It is just as important for no-one to be able to or have to refuse the European Parliament or its committees any documentation.	0.7890766315448783
Members of Parliament must possess the qualities of morality, discipline and discretion over delegated issues innately, and these certainly cannot be imposed on them by anyone else.	0.6116075374500615
I would point out that there is no European legal system, but that a different legal system exists in each Member State.	0.954650177513378
We run the risk of delegating issues relating to the same offences which will then be punished in different ways.	0.6790924403439809
I agree that an investigation system should be introduced, but I am also absolutely convinced that we must recognise the right to equal respect for dignity and, in any case, the equal need for the right to a defence.	1.1031692168035707
I am opposed to European Community officials being accused of criminal acts at the drop of a hat: whistle-blowing is a method that has no place in the third millennium.	0.4855571030331333
In conclusion, Mr President, Parliament must introduce a principle of democracy: we must implement reforms which allow Parliament to grow and expand its powers, not go into reverse.	0.904717040458962
This debate on the van Hulten report brings to a close one of the most traumatic periods for the European institutions since their creation in 1957.	0.8833727062061661
The refusal of the European Parliament to grant discharge and the definitive refusal for the 1996 budget; the motion of censure tabled in this House a year ago for differing reasons; and the first report of the Committee of Independent Experts on the reform of the Commission which led to the mass resignation of the Commission itself, are now part of European folklore.	1.0610494340252623
Those of us involved in these historic events are well aware that none of the upheaval would have been caused had we not acted with parliamentary power to press for changes in the way in which the Commission operated.	0.7611350888860725
Remember that the Council of Ministers, absent again this evening from our debate, approved the 1997 discharge - not the 1996 - on the very day the Commission itself resigned on 15 March.	0.8599600552533372
Now we come to the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts which we already had the opportunity to welcome and briefly debate last September.	0.6914231312572464
Our greatest concern in the EPP is to ensure that public confidence in the European Commission is restored.	0.9772113857081596
Further steps to build a strong Europe will be to no avail if the European peoples perceive that there is no adequate system of democratic accountability for over-zealous officials.	0.7645200952528112
Under no circumstances will we concede ground which we have won over the past few months, which we believe to be in the interests of openness and transparency.	0.8775778775807104
We are therefore concerned to see the flurry of Commission announcements in recent weeks by Commissioner Kinnock suggesting policy proposals of various kinds to be put in a White Paper shortly.	0.6977865115235384
While conveying a desire to proceed rapidly, it also gives the impression that the Commission is in transmission rather than listening mode.	0.8966941230072958
Our concern is strengthened if the rumour reported a few days ago is true - namely that the Commission wants to limit severely the access of Parliament to information.	0.7148828340582262
This was, after all, one of the causes of the downfall of the last Commission.	0.7301335866456582
Have the lessons not been learnt?	0.31964214693952275
The knowledge that the framework relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission still remain to be negotiated led to our disagreement with the rapporteur when we debated his report in committee.	0.9719650069611477
We could, in no way, agree with his view that it would be demeaning for Parliament to set out detailed instructions as to what we wanted the Commission to take up in its reform package.	0.9595229716607797
The less precise, Mr van Hulten, we are in our resolutions, the more room it gives the Commission and your former colleagues in the Council to do what they like.	1.1256636306693248
We believe the vast number of recommendations of the Wise Men' s report should be implemented.	0.6806393393015069
We have, as the EPP-ED group, submitted all the recommendations of the Wise Men' s report in committee and many of them have now been put into the report, entirely changing the nature of the van Hulten report in committee.	0.8392350536187867
We have resubmitted a few amendments which fell in committee, in particular, our desire to see the codes of conduct revised specifically to include the reference to merit and managerial capacity which you, Commissioner, accepted - when we had our hearings last September - should be included in these codes of conduct, particularly when considering appointments and promotion.	0.7958798223262854
Looking to the future, we know that we are at the beginning of a long process of continuing reform in the European Commission.	1.2308498969931014
We want in particular to see the hard-working and highly competent norm for Commission officials acknowledged in the outside world - a reputation that has been darkened by the inappropriate conduct of a few individuals.	0.7197855940120084
Commissioner, you will be aware from your presence in the last Commission why the crisis occurred.	1.016783580980379
In a nutshell: there were programmes being run for which there were insufficient staff resources available.	0.6372064502636396
We urge you to take the opportunity to establish the real staffing needs of the Commission based on the essential activities for which it is responsible.	1.0293574829271415
Our position was made very clear on this topic in the 2000 budget.	0.5075135564045733
We will be vigilant over the next five years to ensure the reforms now being suggested are fully implemented and will support efforts made to modernise institutions.	0.7071091341911055
But, equally, we will not hesitate to withdraw our support financially or otherwise should steps be taken which do not correspond to the openness promised by Commission President Romano Prodi prior to his nomination.	0.6557939247594792
Let us hope that we can avoid institutional upheavals by having an ongoing dialogue which assumes from the outset that Parliament will be an equal partner in deciding the outcome of Commission reform.	0.7727947272552992
Mr President, I must start by apologising that I cannot be nearly as dramatic as Mr Elles in my presentation.	0.7614131518904237
Can I first thank Mr van Hulten for this report.	0.5636606830675869
It is an excellent report.	0.8689541014533848
It would have been wrong for Parliament to have put in willy nilly every single recommendation that came from an external body because Parliament should have its own opinion on these issues.	0.633714342406615
It is right for us to have a focused report which is what Mr van Hulten has produced.	0.9257582077138046
Can I invite Mr Elles not to put the cart before the horse.	0.4674238611591576
Yes, a lot of things were lost by the Socialists but they have not been won in plenary yet, and may I warn him that may not be the case tomorrow.	0.8363887450300698
I should like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for all his efforts so far.	0.6852338544436684
He has been clear that his commitment has been to produce a radical change.	0.7966662923595386
Central to this is the attempt to produce and engender responsibility.	0.7509702304834297
It is clear that this needs to be developed at all levels and it needs to recognise the needs of each level within the Commission.	0.8634754220817915
It is clear that we need to see a change in the Financial Regulation.	1.0565780172950985
That is important.	0.36785357417822145
We need to stop people passing the buck from one to another.	0.4736076207971499
Where failure is occurring within the Commission we need to hold people responsible.	0.6498250361985853
We need to be assured that consistent under-performance must lead to dismissal.	0.5491246247387984
This is natural elsewhere but it seems to be an extremely radical suggestion when it is put to the Commission.	0.9049848070567157
We cannot continue with a situation where incompetence, mismanagement and fraud are costing the European taxpayers money and providing them with a poor service.	0.5489710838400406
I will give you one example of this.	0.6031036797819762
In the 1998 Court of Auditors report an exchange rate miscalculation in relation to Italian wine cost the taxpayers of Europe GBP 8 to 10 million.	0.4426132825262333
It is clear that is not acceptable.	0.9437842318634247
What happened to the person who was responsible for that miscalculation?	0.6260437823848103
We need a system which provides incentives and promotion and we need to see this promotion based on merit.	0.8316103425465735
We recognise that most of the officials within the Commission are extremely hard-working.	0.8403511587623748
But we also recognise that some of the practices are outdated.	0.7176604457971432
We look forward to reading the full Commission proposal on reform and we look forward to working out the detail alongside the Commission because, unlike what Mr Elles has just said, the Commissioner has made a commitment to discuss it with Parliament between now and 1 March.	0.7540242533584846
We also need to recognise that people who live in glasshouses should not throw stones.	0.6688687603595025
The European Parliament has not exactly been clean in its approach to things throughout its history.	0.7643517124182053
We have a long way to go before we are perfect ourselves.	0.9598809833194808
Our own staff policy is outdated.	0.2722044999062684
Some of our working practices need radical reform.	0.5432097120533119
I hope that the European Parliament will be hanging onto the coattails of the Commission in this reform process.	1.0888012521197719
We recognise the proposals on activity-based budgeting.	0.6236762074130479
We recognise that means discipline on the part of Commission officials and we recognise also that we have a responsibility within Parliament on discipline when we talk about negative priorities.	0.8058712234520115
Finally, can I say that the Commission needs to work on its relationships with the public.	1.1137854053338425
European taxpayers need to be re-assured.	0.5071403297596224
The fate of the Commission, of the whole European Union, rests on delivery of this reform.	0.8210729898778476
That is the key issue, delivery of these proposals.	0.9147902805275789
Mr President, I would like to start by extending my compliments to the rapporteur, Mr van Hulten, on his first report.	0.8499146157838904
I very much admire him for keeping his spirits up at a time when he was inundated with so many amendments.	0.49629997369184786
I think that the report drawn up by the Wise Men has been useful and I think that it is also useful for this Parliament - as already stated by Mrs Morgan - that we ourselves should ask for expertise from outside for once to see how our administration is run.	0.9440473446381367
We have submitted an amendment to this effect.	0.6611422848807533
From the many points made by Mr van Hulten in his report, I would like to highlight a few, not necessarily in order of importance but just randomly.	0.8125084048172362
Firstly, I think that the Commission should pay much more attention to the proper storage of documents.	1.115803653619012
The Commission' s records leave a great deal to be desired.	0.550475756631939
We noticed this when we had to investigate the Flechard affair, which, as it happens, has still not been sorted out.	0.9257581489955934
Curiously, very important documents had gone missing from the cabinets, even from those of the President and of various Directorates-General, and this is clearly something which should not happen.	0.9336797856273347
If Parliament want to carry out proper inspections, these documents must be available, and I would like to know what the Commission intends to do to improve this situation.	0.8922674281405808
I would also like to say a few words about ex post financial control.	0.5755053187966069
This has also been partly dealt with in the van Hulten report. I think it would be useful if we were to give report figures per category and per sector on how the budget is implemented.	0.8863099826924046
The general impression at present is that anything budget-related within Europe is bad.	0.46227615544936196
It is clear that, over the past couple of years, we have noticed an upward trend in agriculture and a downward one in structural expenditure.	0.7430634100346155
Is this possible?	0.1692486622759503
I would like to suggest to the Commission that it prescribe a deadline by which the reforms have to be carried out.	0.7775143875999899
If we admit new Member States then we need to put our own House in order first.	0.5393884579001118
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr van Hulten.	0.8525290944811111
It is his first report here in plenary.	0.45638154943647014
This is worth a compliment although I regret, of course, that he did not expound it in his own mother tongue.	0.7072364524197442
It is a report which came about with difficulty and may well be too late.	0.7386418353677031
In my opinion, this is mainly down to the wrangling between the two major groups within our Committee on Budgetary Control.	0.74602907940693
Let us be honest.	0.3833543401113012
The second report of the Wise Men arrived in September.	0.40136224631965456
We are now four months down the line.	0.5902570639376634
Meanwhile, Mr van Hulten has been inundated with amendments, more than 100 amendments in the first round.	1.0044126574781027
He went back to work, rewrote his report and took into account the very many suggestions, but had to face nearly another 100 amendments in the second round.	0.7709108745202184
My fear is that all of this has contributed to a report which is too detailed, too extensive and too late.	0.983617498222206
Moreover, I have been informed that the Commission has approved a report - today of all days - on the reform of the Commission which will be distributed for further consultation to the various institutions and also to our Parliament, I hope.	1.146508145316424
Might Mr Kinnock be able to throw some light on the matter this evening?	0.5594015774008697
Mr van Hulten, my Group of the Greens and regionalists will support the attempts in tomorrow afternoon' s plenary meeting to embellish this report.	0.6789746857395526
After all, it makes no sense to copy the many sound recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men word for word in your report.	0.7747697423355694
So tomorrow, if we vote against some amendments or against specific paragraphs, this is certainly not on account of their content but rather to render your report as a whole more readable.	0.8532181332254849
In any case, it should be clear that my group, of course, fully backs the recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men.	0.8552255743007806
In any event, I look forward to the document which was approved by the Commission today.	0.9908919176952541
I also look forward to the White Paper which will be available in February.	0.879905381705268
I have to inform you, Commissioner, that both the report of the Wise Men and that of Mr van Hulten will become gauges for our group, gauges which should make it clear to us whether we can have confidence in the Prodi Commission or not.	0.9094876572898769
I would like to end on the following point. Just as the White Paper on food safety was approved last week and released to public opinion with a clear deadline stated, we would request the same in connection with the new White Paper on the reform of the Commission.	0.9036822288150271
I think that there is a need for this, as public opinion is looking for change and, in any event, my group would like to see a clear change by the end of 2002.	1.0178690452617896
Mr President, this report is positive but, actually, we need more than this.	1.2378517208349173
Fraud, mismanagement and nepotism do not come from nowhere.	0.539511804106655
They are most likely to occur if there is little democratic control on cash flow.	0.5333411404248879
Via the structural funds, a great deal of the European budget is being pumped around the system.	0.9634982073708471
This is only useful as long as there is a sense of solidarity where rich Member States contribute to both the revenue and development of poorer Member States.	0.75690592130951
But there is also funding which is being pumped via Brussels back to the same rich Member States.	0.8813571403029989
Districts and regional authorities consider this as their own money but they can only get their hands on this by investing vast amounts of money and manpower in lobbying and negotiating.	0.5740897564772187
After each incident of improper use of this money, and certainly after fraud, the call for stricter control is more pronounced.	0.7527386458699904
Even the strictest control cannot solve this problem.	0.2727087334197643
It will, at best, lead to more bureaucracy and less room for local democracy and for people to get involved in choosing and developing projects.	0.636897465861502
It would be preferable if national governments channelled this money directly to their local governments without a European detour.	0.500741673130585
In the next couple of years, we will need to think about the possibility of replacing structural funds by an equalisation fund which is limited to budgetary aid for Member States or their constituent regions with a low income per capita of the population.	0.7673696903776969
This is probably the only way to achieve less fraud, less overheads, more transparency and more democracy.	0.7264344974383655
Mr President, a year has not yet passed, but it is already clear that Parliament is going to evaluate the first and second reports differently.	0.9967396870216079
The first report was widely publicised, formally debated and used - just like the controversy and news leaks which preceded it - to make mincemeat, first of the President of the Commission, and then of the majority of the European Commissioners, even though they had no connection with fraud, mismanagement or nepotism.	0.9575346730113691
Reading now what happened then, not even a year ago, it becomes clear that that first report was intended to do anything but serve the cause of truth or reform, as is maintained today, so much so that this second report - which, on the other hand, could have provided much more salient points - was commissioned with the precise mandate not to address specific cases, since there is no intention to follow up the offences detailed in this report.	0.8799025180398653
It is of no concern to the major groups in Parliament, nor to the majority of the trade unions, who are busy discussing the defence of European public administration, but, in practice, are occupied with the corporate protection of their own members, putting the wide powers afforded to them to dubious use.	0.9130759231904715
Trade union representatives sit on the Disciplinary Board and the Staff Regulations Committee, thereby making it impossible to remove disloyal officials and preserving the Staff Regulations in their fossilised state.	0.6113633859380734
Incomprehensibly, trade union representatives are also members of committees on competition, and I would not be surprised if union members were already members of OLAF, thereby placing this institution which should, at least formally, guarantee its impartiality, at great risk.	0.8326839378672067
I therefore understand why we are meeting at this time, which is usually set aside for other activities and not for debates, discussions and the exchange of information.	0.7590215415696061
Mr President, when it comes to putting its own house in order, the European Commission is in a Catch-22 situation.	0.9439190860915418
There is enormous pressure of expectation following the events that led to the resignation of the previous Commission.	0.6937332546427306
I sometimes have the impression that the more radical the proposals made here in this Chamber sound, the more applause they receive.	0.8780914578852933
There again, it is simply not possible to change situations once and for all with a few strokes of the pen, and the problems begin as soon as we have to start talking about implementation and getting down to brass tacks.	0.8984108134350085
This may explain why we experienced more difficulties than anticipated in the Committee on Budgetary Control as regards this issue.	0.4891809431584309
Nevertheless, the outcome is now on the table and there for all to see, and I would expressly like to thank Mr van Hulten for the work he has done on this report.	0.9470487668637112
Provided this report is not watered-down yet again by the adoption of amendments, it will afford us the opportunity to make clear and unambiguous demands of the Commission on a number of crucial points.	0.9468658962045836
Allow me to start with the most important demand.	0.8724522631017889
We do not want financial control to be abolished.	0.6761237296671341
The financial controller should still be able to make checks before funding commitments or payments are made, not in every case, but wherever uncertainties or risks arise.	0.7498248248939997
The Commission is sending out the wrong signals here, by renaming the Directorate-General for Financial Control as the Directorate-General for Audits, for example.	0.7939582402517766
It may well be easy enough to change the Commission' s organisation chart but it is a different matter when it comes to the legal texts, particularly those relating to budgetary discipline.	0.8076069459428175
I do not have exact figures, but the Community' s budgetary discipline and the associated implementing provisions apply to almost 100 different areas of responsibility of the financial controller, to his or her independence and the tasks assigned to this office.	0.8570358707273164
This cannot be ignored or evaded, certainly not on account of soft law, as was once suggested at a meeting of our Committee.	0.7871891165741715
Irrespective of such legal considerations, it would be an unforgivable mistake, under the circumstances, to scrap financial control in the traditional sense at the very moment when those responsible for such matters in the Commission are, at long last, no longer out on a limb but set to become part of a chain of functioning supervisory and investigatory mechanisms.	0.860479699298247
As we see it, there will be a dovetailing of three mechanisms in the future: a system of independent prior approval by the financial controller, concomitant and follow-up control by the internal audit service - also known as the audit service - which has yet to be set up, and finally, there will be the targeted tracking-down of irregularities by OLAF, the new anti-fraud office.	0.922970799662281
It is to be welcomed that Mr van Hulten' s report makes the connection between all three areas and also makes it clear as to where the crucial shortcomings lie, which must be tackled.	0.8807930508540769
A few salient points: the disciplinary procedures are not taking effect, especially when it comes to calling officials to account for their misdemeanours, including those of a financial nature.	0.7726337071855925
There is a large grey area and a great lack of clarity where criminal sanctions are concerned, and it is precisely in this area that the announcements made by the Commission are rather vague.	0.99968015174998
I can only emphasise that these are the really hard nuts that finally need to be cracked.	0.7464084939341026
Mr President, firstly I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to my colleague, Mr van Hulten.	0.7994315555867118
It is a good feeling to be able to say that he is from our delegation and I am, I think, entitled to feel a little proud of him.	0.927270265601256
I would in any case like to congratulate him on his report.	0.8536897441484458
Mr President, the Commission' s resignation has also created a culture of fear amongst many officials within the hierarchy and large bureaucracy.	0.6264880506386655
The call to make a cultural U-turn and embrace a culture of responsibility seems to me a very fundamental one.	0.7005232307474906
I have witnessed from close up within the Development Committee how thousands of projects stagnate and how sometimes up to 80% of the money is not spent. Sometimes, an enormous reservoir of money is created, not because it is not desperately needed, not because there are no sound proposals, but because the whole system has collapsed.	0.9274184134917356
A lack of responsibility, too much ex ante, not enough ex post and, as a result, far too little in the way of a culture of real effective spending.	0.9577092758627784
It would be marvellous if this report were to give the green light to result-oriented spending of this kind, with all the work organised on that basis.	0.7993633675561239
When the Commission' s first draft report soon becomes the official report on 1 March, I very much hope that our input here will help ensure that we will actually witness this change.	0.8011667274009449
Without any doubt, this will then be a service, Mr President, to the European public and, by means of the results we produce, we will also regain and re-acquire something which we have ostensibly lost over the past couple of years.	1.1465838306356795
This is the best support we can give to European democracy.	0.8539476283432298
If, in this way, we can move away from the culture of the fifties and cross over into the next century, we are witnessing a very special moment indeed.	0.997804736689344
Mr President, first of all, congratulations to Michiel van Hulten for his first report.	0.5285818895689696
It was a baptism of fire but we have a saying in the Netherlands appropriate for this occasion: in at the deep end and you will swim in no time.	0.7769667127857439
Mr van Hulten, I think you deserve a medal for your efforts.	0.8561030095830392
There are two points which, in my opinion, deserve special attention on the part of the ELDR.	0.7386469576601805
Firstly, there is the Commissioners' individual responsibility.	0.7575348671247458
This must be regulated during the IGC.	0.6363306725584719
However, we should not like this important issue to end up entirely in the hands of the Council and we have, therefore, submitted an amendment in which we ask whether an interinstitutional agreement could be reached between the Commission and Parliament in order to ensure that we have a kind of fall-back position and are not placing our fate completely in the hands of the Council.	0.9834455554267252
Secondly, as already mentioned by my colleague, Mr Mulder, the ELDR is of the opinion that the European Parliament should also be investigated by independent experts.	1.0413259854041563
This will contribute hugely towards re-establishing the confidence of the European citizens in this institution.	0.7607730130309682
We at the European Parliament cannot be a credible counterpart to this reformed Commission as long as we do not search our hearts and put our own House in order as well.	0.6928981560223421
Only when all European institutions are reformed will we have the open, democratic and decisive Europe which our citizens now finally deserve.	0.7272879382317007
Mr President, I also wish to congratulate Mr van Hulten on this first piece of work which he is presenting to the House.	0.889647357969573
I am sure that it will serve, amongst other things, to make his second report more flexible and for him to step up efforts to find a consensus amongst the groups.	0.8002781173314972
At this stage, there can be no delay in the process of reforming the Commission, demanded by our citizens.	0.7460633513404397
This Parliament has often heard the desire to reform the Commission expressed, even by its Presidents.	0.8784082954942498
It now appears that this desire is more serious.	0.405566931325429
After the resignation of a Commission and after a Committee of Experts has listed an almost endless number of deficiencies, it makes sense that Mr Prodi should have promised, on 14 September, to present this Parliament with a complete plan for reform by February.	0.8413345029962139
This Parliament anxiously awaits this complete reform programme.	0.21355664904933755
The report that we are debating today intends to give political force to many of the recommendations of the Committee of Experts commissioned by this Parliament.	0.9000535926475903
Mr Prodi said he would act anyway, that he preferred to get things right, but that fear of not getting things right would not prevent him from acting.	0.7776396126093471
We therefore ask that his programme be a bold one and, if it is, I can assure him that he will have the support of this House in the reform process.	1.174344473191624
We want a strong Commission, which can act in an independent and neutral manner, but with political sense.	1.132019823302788
Commissioners should not be considered senior officials but rather politicians in office.	0.4638987750117169
Therefore, the report allows them to be members of political parties and to be members of political bodies affiliated to their parties.	0.9228626360578991
Perhaps the reference to the posts is imprecise.	0.45781528122726445
I do not know your exact view in this respect, Mr Kinnock, but it is clear that we want Commissioners who are politically strong and politically committed.	0.8842507809207126
We want a structure which allows every Euro to be spent effectively, and our accounts demonstrate that this is not happening at present.	0.9197553979995836
Therefore, Commissioner, we ask Mr Prodi to present us with a bold programme, and he will find that he has problems with those bodies who feel that their status quo is under threat, but not with this Parliament, which expects profound and daring changes.	0.9623265610503049
Mr President, the Santer Commission came to grief because financial control failed all down the line.	0.5157259198459495
Therefore, the future of this new Commission will depend in no small measure on the extent to which reforms are swiftly undertaken here and financial control is back in working order.	0.7178164184146035
As far as this is concerned, a number of people have already referred to the fact that the Commission intends to drastically improve and consolidate its follow-up checks and that these checks should be carried out on a completely independent basis, with no sweeping of matters under the carpet in future.	0.8100307201770268
Naturally, this is only to be welcomed.	1.1343703273401191
What I do not understand is why this has to come at a price, as it were, that is, of having to dispense with independent - and I stress, independent - prior approval.	1.0383243777410334
Up until now, the Commission' s payments could only be made when the authorising officer signed the appropriate order and the financial controller gave his approval in the form of a visa.	0.6538419115558616
And so it is the "two key" principle that applies here.	0.705270008090527
A single key is to suffice in future.	0.2948860746847543
The financial controller is no longer to make advance checks, if all goes to plan as regards the reforms currently under discussion within the Commission.	0.7846001854531658
If you will pardon me for saying so, Mr Kinnock, what you are proposing is a little like abolishing the police because they were unable to prevent crimes.	0.9009521540132339
What we really need to focus on, however, is making the checks more effective.	0.7194883054455252
This could be achieved by no longer insisting, in future, that the financial controllers furnish every single payment transaction with their approval stamp.	0.8075903922119622
It is precisely those who feel the need to control everything that end up controlling nothing at all.	0.5995765878211735
Therefore, in future, prior approval should take place in a targeted manner, that is, only in cases of uncertainty or risk.	0.9434389948620574
The officials responsible for financial control should be deployed on a decentralised basis, that is, in the operational Directorates-General, amongst those of their colleagues that spend the money, so that they are immediately available when problems arise and so as to render the checks less ponderous and time-consuming.	0.693683115130047
However, the financial controllers must work independently.	0.947308155990276
That is the crucial difference between our plans and those of the Commission, when it talks in terms of decentralisation.	0.8833386401840473
It is obviously the Commission' s intention to make the financial control officials subordinate to the individual Directorates-General, but this is precisely what we do not want.	1.001751972739862
Surely we have learnt this much from the events surrounding the Leonardo affair, when the internal examiners in the relevant Directorate-General issued warnings, but these were neither heeded nor passed on.	0.7024188078415065
Therefore, independence is prerequisite for effective checks.	0.36181035732756706
That is the position which a clear majority of the Committee on Budgetary Control subscribes to.	0.7878638923492918
Indeed, the new Commission has now declared itself in favour of follow-up checks having this independence, and so would it not make sense for a system of prior approval to enjoy such independence as well?	0.8729608985026416
I believe we should set the seal on this point at tomorrow' s vote.	0.8039400661958092
Mrs Theato has already expressed as much and I am only too willing to support her in this regard.	0.7526840997183055
Mr President, a couple of years ago, the previous Commission tried once and for all to tackle rigid and obsolescent structures.	0.9032350110386729
This led to strikes and smear campaigns by intransigent trade unions, whereupon the proposals were abandoned and replaced by a wishy-washy compromise.	0.375003259220254
This was stupid of the old Commission, and Parliament was of no help on that occasion.	0.8643470106453447
When I read Mr van Hulten' s passage about personnel policy, I am afraid that Parliament may again be failing to tackle the crucial issues and just spouting a lot of hot air.	0.6794650702501717
There are too many rights, too many regulations and too little room for leadership.	0.760736508381584
There is no backbone, and no teeth.	1.0438210033854882
Where is the beef?	0.18082790184572012
And I would also say this to you, Commissioner: please, deliver the beef even if it is British.	0.9671939748588929
Romano Prodi promised a revolution.	0.14743554948342488
You have said some powerful and worthwhile things yourself, but take care now that you do not dodge the crucial issues, the ones where it hurts!	0.8383884751724824
Sort out the tangle of staff allowances.	0.2451755885960456
Stand firm on the demand for mobility, not as a right, as it says here in the report, but as a management tool.	1.0849098069024017
Ensure too, that training becomes a management tool.	0.6635413945761429
Do not listen to the report' s demands that temporary staff should have their employment confirmed.	0.6563590578481865
It is the posts which should possibly be made permanent and not necessarily those employed on a temporary basis.	0.5389966204595843
Finally, Mr President, as a member of the Bureau until six months ago, I would urge you to address this issue in the Bureau so that we here in Parliament at least comply, in our own administration, with the demands we are making on others.	1.1149412047777083
We have not done this so far, and this is something you ought to be instrumental in changing.	0.9499733092098175
Mr President, I want to thank Mr van Hulten for his report and to say that I voted for it.	1.0689267185227767
So I refer to the things I do not agree with.	0.6512468420524244
I do not agree with the paragraphs in relation to Parliament.	0.6181717861388499
This report is about the Commission.	1.0549358740737786
Parliament is a separate subject.	0.6386966276490903
There is no need for us to bring Parliament into the discussion on the Commission.	0.8508320548833787
In addition to that, there is the question of duty-free.	0.8787965996258394
That was a stick used to beat the Commission by the duty-free lobbies who resented the fact that the Commission abolished duty-free in airports.	0.6388967420718047
It is not worthy of being brought into this report either.	0.731857811291463
Most of the report is about financial control.	1.040374592675678
That is reasonable because it comes from the Budgetary Control Committee.	0.4945819100977095
But we should not create the impression that vast amounts of European resources are being put at risk by carelessness in the European Commission.	0.8705474581644442
After all, it is only 1% of GDP, by comparison with national spending.	0.8365681868958263
We have had all that before but some people in this Parliament are young and do not seem to understand how small the financial resources of the European Union are and that 80% of these resources are spent by the Member States.	0.8768821135421093
So carelessness within the Commission in the spending of money is not likely to put at risk vast quantities of money.	0.7434915952395351
We should get it into perspective.	0.4280168476541008
It is important to remember that.	0.6164293300587345
The business of the European Commission is very little about spending money.	1.1428353073538728
They have very little of it.	0.31434895869565854
They have a much wider responsibility.	0.6029843485942143
That wider responsibility concerns the management of the environment, food safety, foreign trade, the internal market and so many other responsibilities we have given them without the resources to deal with them.	0.7680327591410915
I am not one of the people who agrees that there is a vast lack of trust.	0.9078679056473045
If there is, we have generated it in this House in the past year.	1.224226102241561
I have been here for 20 years and found absolute trust between the Council, the Commission and Parliament.	0.9679263401270468
We have had our problems and we recognised difficulties but there was not a situation where this bureaucratic Commission was mistrusted, doubted and feared by the citizens of the European Union because they were mismanaging our affairs.	0.7851808441517488
That is a gross exaggeration of what the difficulties were.	0.7126410373592561
This Commission should not have to live forever in the shadow of the mistakes that caused the resignation of the Commission that went before it.	0.861626918916395
While there were problems - and we have to resolve them in view of enlargement, for instance - we sometimes take the negative side too far.	1.0500558070685087
Mr President, I should very much like to thank the rapporteur for his splendid report.	0.978160448129064
I hope that the Commission will use it in its reform work.	1.0013958346421252
The process of reform has been going on for some time, and something like a state of emergency seems to prevail in the Commission.	0.8526063221814147
The Commission' s administration simply does not function particularly well.	0.36787725119023645
Naturally, there are good, capable employees in the Commission, and they are in the majority. But we need radical reform.	1.1781403333303273
There is too little action and too much unnecessary bureaucracy.	0.5607574792607399
People should have clearly-defined powers to take decisions for which they should also be accountable.	0.6942203690121773
The Financial Regulation should be amended.	0.6535030135778748
We agree that we should have better control of the finances.	0.9638052003628137
It is just a question of how.	0.9296360668594644
The Commission and the Committee of Independent Experts are in favour of completely doing away with ex ante financial control.	0.6413691668011152
We should be careful about this.	0.7675880583069065
We should retain some form of ex ante financial control.	0.3227366590774576
It is not enough simply to carry out spot checks once the money has been spent.	0.6787017050239755
This would allow too many anomalous projects to slip through.	0.43990162034289376
Instead, we should be reforming and decentralising control.	0.9130896819039656
The Commission does not have enough staff.	0.7165894694665436
As Members of the European Parliament, we must have the courage to explain to our governments and people back home that the Commission' s staff resources are not at all adequate for the tasks which have been assigned to it.	0.9174610396929229
And the Commission should be able to refuse new tasks if it does not also get the extra staff it needs.	0.6987458754270746
The staffing system is too rigid.	0.2605727046393262
There should be a more frequent rotation of employees, especially at the top of the hierarchy.	0.7327861030438507
It should also be much easier to sack inefficient and incompetent employees.	0.4701659584202162
I am therefore very pleased that the disciplinary procedure is to be reformed.	0.8457200178977466
After all, the very bad experiences so far with disciplinary proceedings show all too clearly how necessary it is that we carry out reforms.	0.7146432036618575
Mr President, Commissioners, first of all, I cannot help but reflect upon the fact that this is, on the whole, a Dutch-British-Scandinavian debate where the speakers are concerned.	0.8182839904177166
Perhaps this is a little worrying.	0.9634111524256622
I hope, like so many others, that the state of emergency in relations between the Commission and Parliament is on the way to being resolved.	1.1042650513229797
We must get away from the idea that we are rushing to put out a fire in one corner, only then to have to rush again to put out the next one. As Mr Blak said, we must instead establish a system with clear roles.	0.9370086185788715
First of all, we need tough regulations, which can be implemented.	1.1382672710478718
Codes of conduct and ethical committees are not enough.	0.3366725039686937
There need to be tough rules stating, among other things, what may be decentralised, what may be outsourced and what is independent.	0.7370275126327729
I find it a little worrying that people are clamouring for independence in this debate without defining what it is in relation to which there is to be independence and without defining what right of decision-making is to be exercised.	0.8619507983753465
What we need, then, are basic administrative regulations for the EU, for its institutions and for the EU in its relations with the Member States.	1.0749010716779384
These are what are missing.	0.4258997758337045
We have asked for a Public Prosecutor' s Office and criminal law, but we also need administrative law for the EU.	1.0111876100398
We should make a good deal of progress if the Commission were to adopt, as binding regulations, the ombudsman' s proposal of a code of conduct for good administrative practice.	0.9026760339282139
The van Hulten report is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough.	0.7996730375229915
Secondly, we must also clarify our own auditing roles.	0.9511679216325711
The Court of Auditors is to monitor the extent to which actions are incompatible with the regulations, but it should not examine the expediency of a particular action.	0.7920329814035252
It is the European Parliament which is to carry out the political evaluation.	1.290630632532218
We do not hunt down criminals. That is OLAF' s job.	0.6807705679454699
Tell me what national parliament, for example, is handed all preliminary investigation documents.	0.5997593808123755
Obstinate as I am, I also want to say that the regulations governing public access to official records must be clearly better than the draft which has been circulating on the Internet. Otherwise, we shall not get anywhere in this fight.	0.9009460142369639
Mr President, I would like to extend a warm thank you to the rapporteur for his report.	0.8954013692735442
I am pleased that I can address him now in Dutch, now that Mr Van den Berg has just done so. Otherwise I probably would have felt slightly guilty about this.	0.7029012646915553
I would like to say that this report represents a huge improvement, also with its amendments.	0.9288973155656906
I am from the Social Committee and rapporteurs on our committee are always proud to receive 100 amendments because then they know that they have tabled an interesting topic.	0.6151935158688387
I think that this is also the case here, but I think it would be a bit over the top to spend too much time talking about these 100 amendments.	1.082256309537172
I would also point out that our coordinator on the Budgetary Control Committee is Mr Pomés Ruiz, who is Spanish and has hence made a major contribution to this debate from a Spanish perspective.	0.791675321856182
Mr President, one of the key aspects which have been mentioned is, to my mind, the rapporteur' s proposal for the standing committee on standards in public administration.	1.0460826385714261
A very important proposal indeed.	0.6453153047458116
I am only very surprised that the Socialist group would like to subordinate this proposal to one tabled by Mrs Morgan, because she wants to scrap it altogether.	0.7690370180049653
I cannot fully grasp the underlying rationale.	0.2953717635639461
On the one hand, we receive all kinds of words of praise for the rapporteur but, at the same time, Mrs Morgan wants to pursue a sort of scorched earth policy on this point and on other key points as well, as a result of which, in fact, the entire content of this report vanishes.	0.8510207363530595
I do not know whether this is to appease Mr Kinnock, but I happen to know Mr Kinnock.	0.9499547815642861
He is happy to hear what our demands are and is quite prepared to be flexible if he considers it necessary.	0.5858261108070532
In my opinion, such a far-reaching scorched earth policy is really unnecessary.	0.6442479893214845
Finally, the issue of officials.	0.8334276471662111
Actually, I do not entirely share Mr Haarder' s view.	0.7745769443087026
I do agree that the section on officials has, in fact, been completed totally inadequately.	0.7025619512694434
First of all, the importance of a public service in general is not at all emphasised. Secondly, all kinds of proposals are nevertheless being mooted, and we have to ask ourselves whether these are terribly appropriate and whether they would lead to improvement.	0.8856479785571447
For example, we are currently looking into TAOs. This is a key point but, at the same time, we want to abolish temporary staff at the Commission.	0.9761792557903084
These two considerations are diametrically opposed to each other, and I really fail to grasp how such a proposal can end up on the table.	0.7376121130798022
Mr President, ever since Plato' s 'Republic' , the Western world has regularly been tempted to replace government by the people with government by experts.	0.6470939146620872
Our Parliament first asked experts to help it evaluate the performance of the European Commission and they took advantage of this invitation to determine, themselves, what its future should be.	0.7340126149674099
In this second report, the experts have gone a step further and criticised some of the political groups in Parliament, which may have hesitated to remove the European Commission from office, since they shared the political affiliations of some of its members.	0.9479518199729768
The experts think that this problem will be resolved by banning the Commissioners from belonging to political groups.	0.5783925408783355
According to the experts, Parliament should no longer have the power to supervise the European Commission. This task should be taken over by a committee which will guarantee high standards in public life, and this should be a standing committee, not elected, presumably made up of another group of experts.	1.0105045427262347
In this, their second report, the experts tell us that Italy is financed by the Cohesion Fund, that the ERDF and the Social Fund represent two-thirds of the Structural Funds and that the principles of additionality and complementarity in the Structural Funds come to the same thing. They tell us that the farming lobby is forcing us to finance rural development through the EAGGF-Guarantee and that the principle of partnership only applies to the Commission and to the Member States.	0.9387811912111053
This lesson in wisdom is 100% ideology and 0% knowledge.	0.31560731679288995
This will not help us to reform the European institutions whilst fully respecting democratic institutions.	0.8628379675056693
The van Hulten report started out as a brilliant one and I would like to pay deep and sincere tribute here to what Mr van Hulten achieved.	0.5757994871905406
Unfortunately, it was then changed, and changed for the worse, which turned it into a document which in fact, proposes something that we cannot accept.	1.0436037654442116
Mr President, Mr van Hulten, your work is worthy of being qualified as enterprising, arduous and complex, and I believe this is important in a first report.	0.9189716959874867
Please therefore accept what I am about to say as being criticism made in the spirit of honest debate, and I believe that in this way our debate here today will be richer.	0.9307564784499185
This report seems to me to be redundant, long-winded, confused and lacking in accuracy in the terms used.	0.5433124264917523
Perhaps 'redundant' is the most serious epithet, and you are not responsible for this. It is the responsibility of this Parliament.	1.1969472352136914
That is to say, if this Parliament commissions a Committee of Experts - and I am not going to repeat what Mr Casaca has said, but I agree with him to a large extent - to analyse a problem, where is the sense in indulging in the medieval tradition of criticising the critics and so on, ad infinitum.	0.8969728140105157
Clearly we are awaiting this reform from the Commission, we are awaiting the proposals which the Commission is going to make to us and this Parliament will have to express its opinion on them.	1.0930741671714914
Meanwhile, we have to offer the Commission a vote of confidence.	1.0984497320716635
'Long-winded' .	0.1350894154531649
I am not going to mention the length of this report.	0.7724604836506264
I do not know if it breaks the record for all the resolutions presented here, but, for this type of resolution it certainly does.	1.006015436556961
I do not believe that there has ever been a resolution - and in this Parliament we certainly produce complex resolutions - which has had paragraphs of more than 16 lines without a single full stop.	1.0319076074507183
It is also 'confusing' .	0.5893497757950665
I am not going to return to what has been said about the analysis of questions concerning Parliament.	0.7690820504930478
That should be the subject of another report and we will have to carry one out and consider that issue, but not in this report.	1.0451194552635947
And finally, Mr President, frankly, I am not going to give examples, but there are many cases in which legal language is used with an alarming lack of accuracy.	0.8444507488865467
Therefore - in summary - I await, and many of us await, your report, Commissioner Kinnock, so that we can really express our opinion on it, which is the duty of this Parliament.	1.1592216217499034
Mr President, the scope and highly detailed nature of the proposals for necessary reform measures show just how important these reforms are.	0.7303333288207966
When one considers the events that have set these endeavours in motion though, it is only too clear as to why there is a need for them.	0.6873657103097617
Hopes and expectations were raised higher still by the strong messages sent out by Commissioners Prodi and Kinnock in plenary and in the Committee on Budgetary Control.	0.5172529872358191
The concept of transparency stands out in the report.	0.5770228188960442
Securing this is a major priority.	0.8969025389559958
The importance of smooth-running, comprehensible work cannot possibly be emphasised enough.	0.4147791424138087
This is not just about bureaucratic reform, however; rather, it is about showing good will towards the citizens.	0.9683051591631667
We must win back their faith in EU politics.	0.30537897236343986
The citizens demand rapid and open access to the institutions and call for EU provisions to be comprehensible to them.	0.6584386977686868
This is what enables them to understand what is going on.	0.7402536334295293
They want to see the politics of success and believe that this is how any politically mature citizen could expect to be served	0.8238512439169401
Whether or not the reforms succeed depends, to a very large extent, on the Commission' s own initiative.	0.9646769543461491
However, it annoyed me when I heard today that the Commission is now saying that it only wishes to discuss the interim report with Parliament on an informal basis.	0.9096332328118729
However, Mr Kinnock, your presentation to the Committee on Budgetary Control this coming Tuesday must not just be a one-way street; rather, as Parliamentarians, we want, and must, play a part in this and it also goes against my understanding of politics when I find that yet another press conference has taken place this week, before we have had chance to carefully discuss the submission in the competent Committee on Budgetary Control.	0.886161229772471
I believe, Mr Kinnock, that notwithstanding all the success achieved on a personal level, the Commission still has quite a lot to do to satisfy our justifiably high expectations.	0.8805094715358049
Can I begin by stating for the record and for the enlightenment of Mrs Langenhagen that the decision for me not to address the full plenary tomorrow and therefore be available for formal responses on the report is not mine and not the Commission's - it was the decision of this Parliament!	1.0009992864434603
So if she has any lectures to offer they are best contained within this House.	0.39523182623732794
She knows me well enough to understand that at all stages in the five years in which we worked together in this House, there has never been a single occasion on which I have refused to account in full, formally and in detail for everything I have done.	0.8175643245538107
Mr President, may I begin by paying tribute to the painstaking and, from what I hear, the pains-accepting work of Mr van Hulten in preparing his report.	0.750924440407895
Although new to this House he is relatively old in some respects, certainly in his familiarity with the Institutions as a former official - and I think that the value of that is shown by his ability to tackle the complex subject which is of critical importance, as several Members have said, to all of our Institutions.	0.9362676847737278
I thank him and I wish him a long and distinguished career as a representative.	0.621799317256801
Mr President, as you will know, Mr van Hulten's report on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts is necessarily long and, since I want to make a comprehensive reply, particularly on the issues relating to financial management and control, I seek your indulgence.	1.0482201884467803
Naturally I will not take up any more of the time of the House than is absolutely necessary.	0.8950900202988616
When this House considered the second report of the Committee of Experts last September, I pledged on behalf of the incoming Commission that the report would be treated as a fundamental ingredient in the Commission's reform proposals.	0.9656560008063699
Our efforts to completely honour that pledge will be evident to the House when consideration is given to the reform package that was adopted by the Commission today, well within the demanding timetable that we set for ourselves four months ago.	0.6961044161412816
I am sure that Mr Pomes Ruiz is encouraged by that.	0.4322260552871357
The great majority of the paper's proposals are closely akin to those put by Mr van Hulten and that paper includes - I say to him and to Mr Staes - a very explicit timetable of actions to be undertaken in pursuit of reform.	0.8451892545518359
There is nothing therefore that is open-ended or vague about the report which I have had the honour to compile.	0.852458101376591
The considered view of this Parliament in the consultation period over the next four to five weeks will for obvious reasons be of great significance.	0.8103387527915387
I would say to Mr Elles that we are most definitely in listening mode.	0.8273085779515944
But he will appreciate - with his customary generosity I am sure - that for us to be able to listen to the response to what we are proposing, it is first necessary to transmit what we are proposing.	0.9947339276614483
Hence the transmission.	0.1414438777653756
Though time forbids me, Mr President, from commenting in this debate on each element in the resolution before the House, I readily give the assurance that the details will be treated as an important input into our reform proposals throughout this consultation and indeed to our work in other relevant areas.	0.8420902348784032
Turning to the main themes of the resolution I offer the following observations.	0.7404756909247876
The need for transparency is rightly stressed, not least because greater transparency in the way in which the Commission operates will improve the efficiency and will also demystify what the Commission does.	0.9962103066253882
This is essential for an executive administration that must be accountable, not just to this House, but more generally to the European public.	1.0821395011049302
Naturally, sensible safeguards are required to protect specially sensitive information, but the cases where these are needed should be kept to the minimum possible.	0.7481953115346454
I have repeatedly emphasised that, indeed not just as a Commissioner, but in 25 or 30 years of campaigning.	0.8924286342952703
That most certainly is the intention of the Commission.	0.7833201753864281
Financial management and control is obviously a crucial area of reform.	0.6302091650542105
As the House knows and has repeatedly said, the scale and scope of the Union's financial interventions have grown immensely in the past decade without a proportionate increase in staffing or an adjustment in procedures.	0.6608290215676151
Several Members have made that point again in the course of today's debate.	0.6088181752850578
We share the view, forcefully expressed by the Committee of Independent Experts, and repeated in this draft resolution that the time has come for a thorough overhaul of our rules and procedures.	0.8366951109919971
The means of doing that are set out in the reform strategy and the Commission will present its proposals for a radical recasting of the Financial Regulation in April.	1.0976877375404668
Parliamentary support in pursuing that essential course for change will be absolutely vital.	0.38397247017420216
I share the view expressed by Mrs Theato that it would not be acceptable in any way at all for us to seek to operate new arrangements without a change in the law.	0.8760027698537849
Change in the law is fundamental.	0.5501288313045046
There are preparations which can be made and they are specified and set out with the full reassurances in the reform strategy, but enactment of change in the legislation is obviously of fundamental importance to the operation of the new system.	0.9140885997637344
Essentially - and with legal change - the Commission will systematically move away from the current centralised system of prior approval of each financial transaction by the Financial Controller and instead strengthen the internal control systems within spending departments so that Directors-General are better equipped to take responsibility for decisions with an impact on the European Union budget.	0.8614132797585891
In addition, and to achieve better assurances than those provided under the present system, the new system of decentralised controls must be complemented by setting up an internal audit service - "the second key" as Herr Bösch said, established in a way that is closely consistent with the recommendations of the Committee of Experts.	1.0436790898610422
That service will open on 1 May this year.	0.33289797937480975
It will be headed by a professionally qualified member of the audit profession and its independence must and will be guaranteed through a new provision to be added in the financial regulation.	0.7242930295931084
The new service will report to me and it will be accompanied by an Audit Progress Board chaired by my colleague, Mrs Schreyer, who I am delighted to see in the Chamber this evening.	0.8166005286524964
As Budgets Commissioner, here responsibilities already include relations with the Court of Auditors.	0.6926989137735258
This Audit Progress Board will ensure effective and rigorous follow-up to internal audits.	0.5372402903410931
I want to emphasise strongly that changing our control systems will definitely not mean relaxing them.	0.5366162288224554
The proposed change will make the systems more effective, both in terms of inputs and in terms of measured and accountable outcomes.	0.5930325224467187
I can also specifically assure the House that we are not going for what is sometimes called "a big bang approach".	0.8317815772028951
Financial control' s ex ante visa for each spending department will only be relinquished as and when the internal control system in a department is shown to be fully adequate.	0.6479684953275865
I am somewhat surprised that paragraph 10 of the draft resolution does not appear to address the fundamental criticisms of the current centralised financial control function made in both reports of the Committee of Independent Experts.	0.7404862061819029
That committee was very clear about the need to abolish the centralised ex ante visa.	0.6300593756905116
It was clear too on the need to separate internal audit from financial control.	0.48002637547911625
In addition, I do not believe that paragraph 10 fully reflects the opinion of the Court of Auditors in 1997.	0.7729378599555353
Naturally the Court will be able to give its considered opinion on the proposed changes to the Financial Regulation but it is useful to recall Mr Karlsson' s comments to this House last month. "The Commission's internal control" he said "is not forceful enough in preventing incorrect operation.	0.8879192958175512
For instance, the Financial Controller granted a positive a priori visa in most of the cases of mismanagement or irregularities recently uncovered.	0.7124396735878209
At the same time, the internal audit function is carried out in an uncoordinated way by several bodies, notably the same Financial Controller, the Inspectorate General and by some units operating Directorates-General."	0.7256636850006544
The centralised ex ante approval system was doubtlessly originally designed to ensure carefulness but, over the years, it has had the perverse effect of reducing the extent to which managers feel responsible for their decisions.	0.6714387844697772
I do not believe that there is any real disagreement between us on this.	0.7618649699564137
I take it from paragraph 10 that the underlying preoccupation of honourable Members is that there should be a carefully managed transition.	0.5557573109131065
That will most certainly be the character of the change as honourable Members will see when they read the reform strategy document.	0.6312416155762913
Our objective, the committee' s objective, the Court of Auditors' objective is not to abolish financial control, it is to get rid of and improve upon centralised financial control.	0.9695684637446306
Before leaving this area I would add that we agree with the rapporteur that the existing internal audit function must be maintained pending the establishment of the new independent internal audit service in a matter of months.	0.8193199750855458
Turning quickly to the section of the resolution on fighting fraud, corruption, mismanagement and nepotism: the major new proposal of the report concerns reporting by Commission officials of perceived wrong-doing.	0.7392758717954352
As I made clear in the hearings last September and on other occasions, we are at one in the belief that there is value in defining the best possible mechanisms for this purpose although obviously we all hope that it will rarely be needed.	0.8533428528238433
Since June of last year, the OLAF regulation has given better guidance to staff about reporting possible irregularities.	0.4778692608395183
We propose to complement those provisions by defining the rights and obligations for officials to report suspected wrong-doing through internal channels but not exclusively within the same hierarchical line.	0.5059998210025844
The possibility of using specified external channels will also be addressed.	0.5259368054811356
We are seeking to implement best practice.	0.45692197078588004
Serious response to reports, confidentiality at early stages and career protection will be assured for people who report wrong-doing in good faith and in ways that do not compromise investigations by untimely disclosure.	0.4407328554827636
As a corollary, there will be safeguards for officials who are the subject of false allegations.	0.6953004356675583
A communication later this year will give full details.	0.3908908159472133
I do not think Parliament will be disappointed by what we will propose.	0.8597441107619498
I am persuaded, however, by the suggestion in paragraph 34 of the report on using external bodies to enforce existing provisions on financial liability.	0.6719609460159097
We already plan to reform the existing disciplinary procedures to ensure thoroughness, fairness, consistency and professionalism.	0.5781260757294111
And we will propose the establishment of an interinstitutional Disciplinary Board - something else on which we will need the support and understanding of Parliament.	0.9739234511519762
A communication in June will set out the full proposal for change.	0.5193080532394861
Standards in public life is the next main section of the report before the House.	0.8088753640792324
With the introduction of a series of codes of conduct the current Commission has begun to develop an explicit ethical framework.	0.5909465386412108
This will be taken a step further with a proposal in June for an interinstitutional agreement on a committee on standards in public life.	0.8118092134455657
That is in line with the draft resolution.	0.6694344306522306
An important role for the committee will be to give advice on ethics and standards and to supervise common and separate codes of conduct for the institutions.	0.7663177763694431
I welcome Parliament's support for that.	0.3767682665618217
We are also currently examining how we can most effectively implement the proposal for a classification system for documents, made in paragraph 50 of Mr van Hulten's report.	0.6432554679802286
The draft resolution rightly recalls the Commission's accountability to this Parliament.	0.7742560290475036
President Prodi and Vice-President de Palacio and other colleagues have demonstrated the Commission's practical commitment to that.	0.7077520378358573
I hope that we will soon be able to agree a code of conduct on relations between our institutions which will include updated rules on access to documents.	0.7869909266447496
The point was very properly raised by Mr Elles and referred to by Mrs Thors.	0.51565173006573
I am sure they are aware that in mid-December we officially received the draft framework agreement with Parliament.	0.7153468748632882
We are now waiting for Parliament to decide when it wishes to begin negotiations on the text.	0.6654340255445857
We are very happy to proceed as rapidly as possible.	0.6553160352822925
The report rightly emphasises the central importance that human resources policy must have in reform.	0.5062645155146601
I am glad to say to Mr van Hulten and Mr Haarder that the detailed recommendations on recruitment, training, appraisal and the appointment to management positions are very much in line with our own thinking and our own proposals.	0.7834718804316876
I also want to move towards a linear career system because the current category system is no longer adapted to the needs of our institutions.	0.6161875904258852
It certainly blocks the advance and mobility of people with proven capabilities.	0.34611921107930854
Members, who, in the course of this debate, have properly praised Commission officials, who in the great majority and typically are of high integrity, hard-working and of great capability, are absolutely right in the comments that they have made.	0.9201194994023099
While the reform strategy White Paper will clearly outline our ideas on these and other points, detail and precision are obviously essential.	0.4952530412820365
A series of communications will therefore follow in the coming months.	0.4858535398709362
Each of them will be available for reflection and response by this House.	0.6517736784020237
It is, meanwhile, very obvious that we will need to work closely with Parliament, as an institution, on central matters of common interest, notably pay and pensions and the revision of the staff regulations.	0.9332824697035903
On this latter point we are reflecting on whether it might be useful to adopt a framework regulation which makes common provision on leading issues like pay, conditions, staff representation rights and so on, but enables the different institutions to operate implementing rules on other matters.	0.60724123718215
The early thoughts of Parliament on this consultative idea would be especially welcome.	0.45198076860728537
I conclude by referring to paragraph 15 of the resolution before the House relating to the resource requirements of our policies for change.	0.6833709802006739
That is most certainly relevant.	0.3255093274764795
We are sure that there will be an important "reform dividend" as the modernisation measures begin to foster increased efficiency and better management in the use of resources.	0.7405999873295723
It is very clear, however, that parts of the Commission services are already very stretched.	1.0974399192382243
Parliament has frequently made that point.	0.31400506900227015
Secondly, it is also clear that reform will require some new investment in training for skills and in technology.	0.6665339592897314
Thirdly, it is very clear that increased preparations for enlargement must be undertaken.	0.808053963409395
