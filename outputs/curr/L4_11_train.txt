Since mitochondrial diseases lead frequently to severe phenotypes and are often hereditary, there is a need for genetic counselling of the affected families.	0.5911064619317872
The specific features of mitochondrial genetics, however, hamper straightforward definition of recurrence risks as in Mendelian diseases.	0.3925056250096226
Empirical risks were recently provided for MELAS and MERRF syndromes and for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.	0.2957998210951371
In MELAS and MERFF, higher levels of mutant mtDNA in the mothers' blood were associated with an increased frequency of affected offspring.	0.5065777991872226
Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia and Kearns-Sayre syndrome are in general sporadic disorders without increased recurrence risks in the offspring.	0.3801143407346771
As Leigh syndrome is found with maternal, autosomal recessive or X chromosomal transmission, the definition of the molecular defect is crucial for genetic counselling.	0.562050266493944
Prenatal diagnosis was reported only in one case of mitochondrial disease so far, and in our opinion it remains questionable because of the uncertain correlation of the proportion of mutant DNA in chorionic villi and in  clinically relevant tissues such as brain.	0.6959633876169683
An accurate and complete depiction of the halo naevus has been left by Matthias Grünewald in his painting "The Temptation of St. Anthony", which is part of the Isenheim altar piece (1512 - 1516), which is now exhibited in Colmar, Alsace.	0.5822985587848468
In contrast, Sutton in 1916 only described a "leucoderma acquisitum centrifugum", leaving the nature of the central lesion in the dark.	0.5610377284712236
The term Sutton naevus therefore appears less appropriate than the alternative eponymic designation "Grünewald naevus".	0.3192519055886519
In women with breast cancer, staging of the tumor plays an important role and often is considered to be the most prognostic and therapeutic factor.	0.7899866546876957
The most widely used staging system is based on the pathologic TNM classification.	0.5019514808291877
In recent years conservative therapies such as preoperative chemo- or radiotherapy are used more often with limited tissue evaluation resulting in insufficient or even inaccurate staging data.	0.5530306881099695
Tumor size as well as nodal involvement is decisive in selecting a treatment method and assessing the response.	0.4224760242346046
Thus, more accurate preoperative in vivo staging is necessary.	0.5318452210679881
This article therefore gives an overview of the different imaging modalities (mammography, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear medicine) used for breast cancer staging.	0.6084972903275088
Furthermore, results of these methods are compared critically with the pathohistologic staging.	0.6407717194549211
The lack of muscle control in neurological disorders often leads to deformities of the foot.	0.40086897273955086
The equinus (a contracture of the triceps surae muscle), the abduction and clubfoot deformity are the most common ones.	0.637924925626343
The present paper describes the deformities and stresses the functional relevance for the patient.	0.5038112766775414
Therapeutic principles of the conservative orthopaedic means are described with special emphasis on the need of an adequate height of the aide and the foot position.	0.6404328997311245
Casting and the application of Botulinun toxine are described having a major side effect of muscle weakening.	0.4086661222576006
A combination of the different procedures, surgical interventions included, need to be selected for each patient offering the best management for each individual problem.	0.7584676174490296
Still's disease was originally described as one form of rheumatoid arthritis in children beginning with fever and other systemic symptoms.	0.5662584220584426
In rare cases it may also begin in the adult and is then referred to as adult-onset Still's disease.	0.5590481516629777
The diagnostic criteria include typical rash, arthralgias, bouts of fever, and leukocytosis, as well as lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly, liver dysfunctions, non-infectious angina, and absence of rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies.	0.5977520392789009
We report two adult patients with longstanding disease whose exanthema guided us to the correct diagnosis.	0.555401246659566
The rash is a finding with high sensitivity.	0.4189789229970348
It is characterized by red macules with distinct borders and is evanescent.	0.3953517470033879
During an acute flare of the rash, gentle friction induces erythematous, isomorphic (Koebner) phenomena, which, as we describe here for the first time, may persist longer than the remainder of the fleeting rash.	0.5647680957482849
Objective: Patients in a surgical intensive care unit (ICU) have a high incidence of nosocomial infections which often lead to septic shock and death.	0.7672731557989108
Since calculated antibiotic treatment is often difficult, it was recommended to obtain routine nose/throat swabs in order to have a better idea of the causative agent when a systemic inflammatory response occurs in a given patient.	0.7302561644324124
Methods: In 1435 patients of our cardio-surgical ICU, routine nose/throat swabs were taken three times a week and tested for micro-organisms and resistance to antibiotics.	0.5145267029671936
Of these 86 patients developed clinical signs of systemic inflammation, and additional blood cultures were obtained.	0.5989743427240571
Antibiotic treatment was achieved to cover the microbes from the nose/throat swabs, or a calculated dosage was given to patients whose swabs had tested negative.	0.582126705809509
Results: Of the 86 patients with systemic inflammation, 29 had blood cultures positive for microbes.	0.6805158248365103
Of these 29 patients, 18 received a calculated antibiotic coverage based on their positive nose/throat cultures prior to the return of the blood cultures from the lab.	0.6492136666814448
However, in only 11 of the 18 patients were routine swabs and blood cultures positive with the same microbes.	0.7442796482620412
While positive routine swabs are quite specific for sepsis when there is a systemic inflammatory response, routine swabs are not a suitable screening tool due to their low sensitivity.	0.6188715569876355
Conclusions: Routine nose/throat swabs led to earlier specific antibiotic treatment in only 22% of our patients with clinical signs of systemic inflammation.	0.6436490236785918
In addition, in almost 40% of the cases organisms detected in the routine swabs and blood cultures were not identical.	0.8436546507336229
As a result, we feel that routine swabs are only of limited value in instituting earlier, specific antibiotic treatment in septic patients.	0.6358411320363269
The influence of defensivity, measured by validity scales of personality inventories (MMPI-K, FPI-R, GIESSEN-Test) on test results and psychotherapy outcome was studied in 309 patients treated with inpatient client-centered therapy.	0.5106456977861807
In general, psychotherapy patients exhibited low defensivity.	0.38284602718100824
25% of patients, who denied psychopathology at admission, did so at discharge and to some extent at follow-up, demonstrating an "especially good outcome" (means).	0.6223587677657665
Relative improvement (effect sizes), however, was significantly diminished in psychopathology scales and significantly enlarged in validity scales.	0.4893799722608344

In our study we tested 2 different rapid assays for cardiac troponin t (TropT-rapid assay, diagnostic cut-off 0,2 ng/ml and TropTsensitive-rapid assay, diagnostic cut-off 0,1 ng/ml) in 75 chest pain patients.	0.5829787555902397
Additional to the emergency ECG (3-lead) we acquired a 12-lead ECG.	0.7395898430300809
The TropT-rapid assay showed a sensitivity of 11% (specifity 94,3%).	0.4915180400120421
The TropT sensitive-rapid assay showed a sensitivity of 62% (specifity 100%).	0.49003790503626676
Despite the great number of publications during the last 10 years concerning the indication, technique and results of operative treatment of acetabular fractures, conservative treatment still has an important role when considering the therapeutic possibilities.	0.6993771286010096
Because of the modern techniques of radiological imaging and improvement of diagnostic facilities, a more defined indication for treatment becomes possible.	0.6879870682441654
Conventional X-rays, completed by special projections like the Ala and Obturator view, and a CT scan allow determination of the fracture type (the Letournel/Judet classification or the AO classification).	0.7113726368632699
The most suitable treatment can then be adapted to the individual circumstances of the patient, i. e., age, general condition and overall severity of traumatic impairment.	0.6001544148336552
Determination of the intact part of the weight-bearing dome is important in selecting the most adequate therapeutic procedure.	0.554442326435253
The larger the intact roof arc, the better the prognosis.	0.4778130518307032
Together with the X-ray controls following axial and facultative lateral extentions, the indication for conservative treatment can be confirmed.	0.6681668954146462
Early active motion of the injured limb, followed by walking exercises with partial weight-bearing, are important aspects of nonoperative treatment.	0.618668825158223
Conservative treatment is recommended in non-displaced fractures or in fractures with little displacement, transverse fractures of the lower region or severely comminuted acetabular fractures with no possibility of reconstruction.	0.6253372913398781
Our clinical and radiological follow-up of 97 patients with acetabular fractures from the years 1981-1990 showed that the majority were treated conservatively (approx.	0.6707420898624413
The functional result after an average observation period of more than 70 months was good or excellent (based on the Merle d'Aubigné score).	0.6323463315353383
We feel it is important to look at operative and conservative treatment of acetabular fractures as two complementary non-competitive therapeutic methods.	0.5310870213434513
The choice of treatment should be based on an exact diagnosis considering fracture type, the individual circumstances of the patient, and application of the necessary diagnostic facilities.	0.826920784496966
Conservative treatment can lead to excellent long-term results.	0.5763305032088705
Problem There is a great need to expand current knowledge of the various functional capacity measurements used in the rehabilitation of chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients.	0.7238546617463735
The literature on these patients reports that mobility, endurance, trunk strength and lifting capacity decrease during the process of chronicity.	0.5398977205211102
Chronically disabled patients appear to have lower functional capacity than asymptomatic persons.	0.361264064777934
Methods Our study group consisted of 90 disabled CLBP patients (44 female, 46 male; average age 42 years) who underwent a multidisciplinary 8-week daily treatment program of functional restoration with behavioral support (instruction, endurance training, strength exercises, behavioral and treatment to facilitate return to work therapy).	0.6033655289146267
Initially these patients where compared with 107 asymptomatic persons (44 female, 63 male, average age 41 years).	0.5022564928490187
The patients were investigated before and after treatment, and at intervals of 6 and 12 months.	0.9747385580036191
The reliability of the functional measurements was evaluated by interrater comparison.	0.6609071091944325
Physical assessment included a medical examination (mainly diagnosis of radicular or nonradicular pain), changes in the lumbar spine revealed by X-ray studies according to Herron and Turner [50], rating of physical impairment according to Waddell [117], flexibility, length of hamstrings muscles (SLR), test of power and endurance of trunk movement by standardized exercises according to the Swiss group of Spring [102] and isokinetic measurements (LIDO Back), tests of lifting capacity (LIDO Lift), and (in part) of general endurance on a cycle ergometer (CASE 15 Marquette).	0.568561996069253
Results Physical findings showed that mobility was reduced substantially in patients suffering from back pain due to reduced SLR (shortened hamstrings) and decreased spinal mobility.	0.4899945336574857
Patients also demonstrated significant reductions in their ability to perform lifting tasks in comparison to healthy individuals.	0.5012985442723559
The results of trunk flexion showed no significant differences between patients and the control group, whereas the ability to perform trunk extension was much better in the control group.	0.7737198870116294
In principle we found the same results with isokinetic measurements as in the exercises without machines.	0.6165092526492052
Cardiovascular endurance was also much better in the control group than it was in the back pain patients.	0.5261001538095296
At the end of the treatment program all physical deficits were improved significantly.	0.5253490150816641
In many cases performance was comparable with that of the control group.	0.6906102420656247
With time, however, training effects gradually decreased.	0.4413883766344196
The success of treatment (return to work, absence from work, pain reduction, use of medical care) was independent of the functional status of the patients before and after treatment.	0.8899994258390332
Conclusion Study results showed that physical capacity in disabled patients with low back pain is substantially reduced in comparison to persons who do not suffer from back pain.	0.6451629207087772
The only exception was in trunk flexor strength and endurance, in which measurements did not differ between the patients and the control group.	0.8629957745713541
However, even CLBP- patients with long-term pain and severe physical illness can successfully improve their physical condition by participating in an active treatment program.	0.6099586250764287
Back extensor muscle training has to be included in physical therapy.	0.49937510333958385
Because of loss of condition during the time after treatment, regular monitoring of patients and their home training programs is necessary.	0.6647950501487933
Overall, treatment of CLBP has to include physical training and psychosocial treatment to achieve satisfactory results.	0.534022350021344
The dynamic behavior of the ossicular chain is very complex and is frequency-dependent.	0.4601275708554556
To date, this has still not been fully investigated or understood.	0.6146079639859714
There remains a lack of measurement procedures to pick up the motion of the ossicles and ear drum simultaneously with sufficient resolution.	0.4707628085917743
The presented paper reports simultanous measurements with laser-Doppler vibrometry at two points of the ossicular chain of cadaver specimens.	0.4430209379037288
Motions not observed were derived using mechanical simulation models on a computer and then evaluating appropriate mathematical equations.	0.3311170969689267
Using a sound stimulus, the displacement velocities of the umbo and stapes footplate were measured, and the corresponding transfer functions were derived by Fourier transform.	0.5561376945717043
Results were used for verification of the computer models.	0.5558488909370235

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are probably not only unintended, toxic side-products of oxygen metabolism in mammalian cells, they also have several important physiologic functions including antimicrobial killing, regulation of cellular proliferation and growth, and regulation of vascular tone.	0.5900191823352713
ROS are generated within the vessel wall by several mechanisms, including a vascular type of a NAD(P)H oxidase.	0.6101465283359367
ROS formation can be stimulated by mechanical stress, environmental factors, the peptide angiotensin II, cytokines, native low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and in the presence of catalytic metal ions.	0.6372913962515842
Their ability to modify LDL, react with endothelial-derived nitric oxide subsequently forming peroxynitrite, and amplify the expression of various genes important for leukocyte recruitment within the arterial wall are the basis of the oxidant injury theory of atherosclerosis.	0.4735912604030129
In animal studies, antioxidant therapy (probucol, butylated hydroxytoluene, N',N'-diphenylendiamide, vitamin E, superoxide dismutase) have been successfully used to prevent fatty streak formation, and to restore impaired nitric oxide-dependent vasorelaxation.	0.5989272224664894
In man, antioxidant therapy (e.g., supplementation with vitamin E) clearly increased the resistance of LDL to oxidative modification.	0.372237451215677
Case-controlled and prospective clinical studies suggest a relation between baseline antioxidant plasma levels and/or antioxidant supplementation and risk of cardiovascular events.	0.47748243638899174
In one secondary prevention trial (randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled), vitamin E supplementation reduced significantly the risk for non-fatal myocardial infarctions.	0.5358540680726445
Before general recommendations can be made, results of further large-scale trials should be awaited.	0.5790755663652777

At the moment there is no consensus about the pathogenesis of RSD.	0.6513448597149775
In 1942 Paul Sudeck suggested that the signs and symptoms of RSD may be provoked by an exaggerated inflammatory response to injury or operation of an extremity.	0.4907500381128406
His theory found no disciples, as most physicians believe that RSD is initiated by an hyperactive sympathetic system.	0.4923870451606887

The Intended-Dynamic Group Therapy, until the unity almost unknown in West-Germany, represented the most important form of therapy in the former GDR.	0.6122789810539154
Its development, its conception of the relevant relationship between group-dynamic and psychoanalytic concepts and in particular its reception of psychoanalytic concepts are discussed.	0.5544893091431504
This raises the question of defining the position of this therapy form with the focus on the controverse about its proximity to psychoanalytic therapeutical concepts.	0.5671121038023091
Even if we take into account that in the GDR there were very reduced possibilities to articulate psychoanalytic and particularly drive concepts, in our view the Intended-Dynamic Group Therapy cannot be considered as a psychoanalytical form of therapy.	0.6993428424377823
It represents a specific therapeutical development of the former GDR which is strongly oriented at social norms.	0.5638081189687328
It is first of all oriented at the attitude change reached by the group, that means, at the manifest, conscious behaviour of the patient and therefore focusses at the normative level of behaviour regulation in groups in the sense of interactional group therapy.	0.6099084916579238
The authors view this form of therapy as a "historical compromise" in the field of psychotherapy under the circumstances of the former GDR and in this way they take into account both its advantages and its weaknesses.	0.7108802769589788
In a prospective study of central fractures of the talus, radiological data (plain radiography, CT, MRI) were scrutinized in terms of correlation with histological findings (biopsy taken at time of screw removal).	0.7346462179258938
The study looked at nine fractures in eight patients aged 14 - 48 years.	0.5421861021825847
There was one fracture of Hawkins type I, one fracture of type II, four fractures of type III, and three corpus fractures.	0.8167477591336506
All were operated on within 24 h after injury; seven had screw fixation, two had adaptation with K wires.	0.5595343934542912
The patients were kept non-weight-bearing for 14 - 53 weeks.	0.771297356214114
Duration of follow-up was 2 years or more in all but one patient.	0.7728225769248135
In the final radiograph the talus was intact in four patients, while four showed a partial avascular collapse; in one patient, a partial collapse was doubtful.	0.8064645045513138
Histology taken 16 - 52 weeks after injury showed osteocyte-free original bone in all cases, with deposition of new bone varying in extent.	0.5699902441650517
Hawkins sign was partially positive in six patients, positive in one, and negative in one.	0.6251835818092354
Decalcification as well as fracture healing can be better followed by CT than by plain radiography.	0.5158199236416959
MRI appeared normal in five patients, partially pathological in two, and abnormal in one.	0.6415007719218742
A positive Hawkins sign and normal signal behavior can be seen as prognostically favorable signs.	0.4702042928874477
However, in the case of a central talus fracture, even with a favorable course osteonecrosis of at least a part of the talus with gradual replacement by new bone occurred.	0.8233886933305897
Vascularization of the central talus seems to be disturbed more frequently than is reflected radiologically.	0.6494093009632829
Purpose: To assess the value of functional magnetic resonance urography for the noninvasive postoperative evaluation of renal transplants.	0.5410363972544651

Using the IKDC score led to 3 very good and 4 good results, 2 fair and 6 bad results.	0.5452765236226003
Using subjective criteria, 10 patients described results as very good or good, 2 fair and 3 bad.	0.6583801661205945
Posterior cruciate ligament rupture with additional knee injury or fracture of the leg showed bad results in 60 % of cases, and good or fair results in only 40 %.	0.6533050455388665
We think augmented repair of fresh injury of the posterior cruciate ligament can be used as an alternative therapy to reconstruction with autograft.	0.7753135576426097
Through cooperation between the German Contact Dermatitis Research Group (DKG) and the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK), results of standardized patch tests performed by the participating centres are centrally recorded in Germany.	0.5761989696472296
For this study, data from 24 departments of dermatology (19678 patients) were evaluated retrospectively and separately for 1995 and 1996.	0.7075098987340803
With decreasing frequency, nickel, fragrance mix, balsam of peru, and thimerosal yielded positive reactions most often; suprisingly high numbers of positive reactions were also seen with amerchol L-101 and palladium.	0.44044248209474224
Differentiated lists of allergens were compiled for 1995, referring to subgroups of patients (defined by gender, age, localization of eczema, geographical region, occupation, sensitization) and particular problems.	0.5619374625624003
In men, percentages of positive reactions were markedly lower for nickel, fragrance mix and balsam of peru than in women.	0.3663566934997703
Younger patients reacted more often to thimerosal and older ones to topical medical preparations.	0.3003518342002718
Medical allergens were also often positive in patients with leg eczema, whereas occupational allergens were found more frequently in patients with hand eczema.	0.6522947737338362
A comparison of positive reactions obtained in distinct geographical regions was problematic because of differences between test populations.	0.4671139946095046
The spectrum of allergens found in officeworkers was similar to that of the whole test population.	0.6527617244606001
Patients with positive reactions to nickel and fragrance mix had more positive reactions to unrelated allergens than the total test population.	0.517889286198998
Sex- and age-adjusted frequencies of sensitization revealed a decrease in reactions to nickel and an increase in reactions to mercury allergens from 1995 to 1996.	0.5604295493978952
The clinical relevance of mercury reactions was often not apparent.	0.40194032456867307

Intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin (BT) induce a localized, long-lasting paresis of the target muscle that can be graded by the BT dose administered and that is free of major side effects.	0.5641774399821504
With this profile, BT can be used for symptomatic treatment of various disorders caused by pathological muscle hyperactivities.	0.6040553143624767
These disorders occur frequently in patients in institutions for neurological rehabilitation.	0.4932086519192654
They are difficult to treat with conventional methods, can cause major suffering and induce substantial costs for our health care system.	0.6011805293008821
In the present study we therefore sought to delineate the use of BT in rehabilitative neurology.	0.5580473627705631
Regardless of the etiology of the particular muscle hyperactivity syndrome, five main indication groups are identified: (1) improvement of function of the hyperactive muscles; (2) relief of pain in the hyperactive muscles; (3) improvement of patient care; (4) avoidance of sequelae in joints, tendons, ligaments, and teeth; (5) various special indications.	0.6643062424963406
Myocardial infarction shows a circadian pattern with a maximum in the early morning hours.	0.6087254297922248
In patients with sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD), it is assumed that apnea-associated changes of hemodynamics, blood gases, and rheology lead to a higher frequency of myocardial infarction during sleep.	0.737106731117364
This investigation analyzes the circadian pattern of myocardial infarction in patients with and without SRBD.	0.5876116636180502

Persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with shortened action potential duration (APD) and reduced atrial refractoriness.	0.6066378958113648
Remodeling of ion currents responsible for AP morphology has been proposed as a major mechanism in persistent AF.	0.45416843896672093
In the present study we investigated the activity of the cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel and the mRNA transcription of the cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel subunits in patients with persistent AF compared to patients in sinus rhythm (SR).	0.6667859143724268
Right atrial appendages of 10 patients in SR and of 5 patients with AF were used for myocyte isolations to record L-type Ca2+ currents (ICa,L) by the patch-clamp technique.	0.6523313774265911
Right atrial appendages of 16 patients in SR and of 5 patients with AF served as sources for determining the mRNA expression of the L-type Ca2+ channel 1c-, 2/-, a-, and b/c-subunits by semiquantitative RT-PCR.	0.6515180053136114
ICa,L density was reduced by 70% (p < 0.001) in AF patients compared to the sinus rhythm group.	0.6819903590486207
Cell sizes, expressed as cell capacitance, were identical in both groups.	0.5287996612228107
mRNA expressions of the 1c-subunit and the b/c-subunits were reduced in AF patients by 18.9% (p < 0.05) and 77.7% (p < 0.005), respectively, while mRNA transcriptions of the 2/- and the a-subunits were not significantly different between SR and AF patients.	0.6680174007904197
A decrease in the availability of functional L-type Ca2+ channels in AF patients, due to reduced 1c-subunit and substantial lack of b/c-subunit transcription seems to contribute to the shortening pf APD and refractory periods in AF, thereby favoring increased atrial excitation rate and perpetuation of AF.	0.5067564361901679
34 patients aged 3 months to 20years underwent transcatheter-occlusion of their patent ductus arteriosus with detachable coils (Cook).	0.43031120191319105
Eight patients had a residual ductus after previous implantation of a Rashkind-occluder; 7 patients had various other cardiac malformations in addition.	0.5670972031450879
Only 6 patients had a large ductus with a diameter between 3 and 4 mm; all had systolic-diastolic murmurs.	0.6684364170116511
All other patients had ductus-diameters below 3 mm; three of them had systolic-diastolic murmurs, 17 had systolic murmurs, and 8 patients had no murmur at all.	0.6418243937415145
The ductus was closed in 24 patients using artrial access only, in 6 patients via a venous, and in 4 patients both via venous and arterial catheterization.	0.817275611266071
One coil was used in 23 patients, 2 coils in 9, and 3 coils in 2 patients.	0.9063925367977645
There were no complications of the intervention.	0.7777163004474075
Within 24 hours 31 patients (93%) had complete closure of the ductus and 32 patients (94%) after 6 months.	0.6805666864673453
Coil-embolisation of the persistent ductus is a quick, safe and cheap method to close a ductus and has clear advantages compared to an operation.	0.5020008696650242
The volume of preoperative screening investigations for outpatient anaesthesia ranges from few, selectively ordered investigations to extensive routine diagnostic procedures.	0.43297406808991346
It seem appropriate to reevaluate benefit and efficacy of routine preoperative assessment programs.	0.3834154621998033
The purpose of preoperative diagnostic is to assess the risk of anaesthesia and surgery for the patient.	0.8690264967308494
As shown by a number of studies, preoperative screening investigations seldom disclose new pathological findings of clinical relevance.	0.6458118066935475
Abnormal laboratory results in otherwise healthy patients rarely alter the anaesthetic management of the patient and are not related to perioperative complications.	0.7069922503540363
Extensive use of costly diagnostic procedures considerably increases health care budgets.	0.2974823860072927
A more selective approach to order preoperative investigations promises considerable savings.	0.3557505695144292
To achieve costeffective evalulation an efficient organisation of properative assessment must be established to avoid costly delay and on-day-of-surgery-cancellations.	0.45152239473871353
There is no medicolegal obligation to perform routine diagnostic testing.	0.4452169901990662
The anaesthetist must be sufficiently informed in time to assess the perioperative risk of the patient and to alter anaesthetic management as necessary.	0.7684703577156938
According to the presented studies a clinical history and a thorough physical examination represent an effective method of screening for the presence of disease.	0.6699654904311827
Careful medical history evaluation and physical examination can avoid extensive investigations in apparently healthy individuals and the latter should only be ordered if indicated.	0.41440092774477144
The botryoid odontogenic cyst (BOC) is considered a rare multilocular variant of the lateral periodontal cyst.	0.6783792500417387
The origin of the BOC can be seen in aberrant odontogenic tissue.	0.5925125211577692
The BOC is found especially in the premolar region of the mandible, as well as in the frontal region of the maxilla of patients aged between 60 and 70 years.	0.8385577092498296
Most of the 11 published articles of BOC have shown high rates of recurrence.	0.47016143845252234
Histopathologically the BOC is marked by multilocular cysts lined by a thin, nonkeratinized epithelium.	0.37163600764959187
Clusters of glycogen-rich epithelial cells may be noted in nodular thickenings of the cyst lining.	0.438868141985122
For the clinician, the differentiation of the BOC from the keratocyst and ameloblastoma is relevant.	0.6163486119383289
One case of a large BOC (65-year-old male, BOC regio 33-45, diameter 5 cm, radiographically and histologically multilocular) is presented with a review of the literature, including the therapeutic management, and the possible diagnostic criteria are discussed.	0.8551183154953426
The immunohistochemically determined expression of cytokeratin (CK) 13 implicates the histogenetic origin of the BOC from the squamous epithelium of the oral cavity and excludes the origin from the small salivary glands.	0.48491283645659344
The expression of CK 19 and the lack of expression of p53, as well as the higher proliferation rate of the basal epithelial cell layer by the BOC, may be useful for distinction between the keratocyst.	0.6551900085251183
Within the framework of a study on vocational rehabilitation of the mentally ill, we examined 83 schizophrenic outpatients enrolled in a work therapy program.	0.6250109385566096
The course of illness and rehabilitation was documented over a 3-year period by means of annual follow-up examinations.	0.7826170974020729
The sample comprised 44 men and 39 women with an average age of 35 years (SD +/- 8,5).	0.6561107153329682
The majority were chronically ill patients with a history of frequent and long psychiatric hospitalization.	0.5664586701874351
After 3 years, 22% of the patients were integrated into the general labor market, 26% had sheltered employment, 23% were still in work therapy, and 29% were unemployed.	0.9405110916957297
Besides the patients' subjective expectations, early introduction of rehabilitative measures and a favourable course of illness were found to be predictors of a successful rehabilitation leading to vocational integration.	0.641290719091988
Outpatient work therapy is a contemporary, effective organizational form of sociotherapy.	0.519906249757909
It may contribute to improved vocational competence and integration, reduced psychiatric hospitalization and stabilized psychopathology.	0.4996757391397503
Objective: Based on personal observations the neuromuscular blocking potency of atracurium was supposed to be diminished in purulent intrathoracic diseases.	0.422386832244903
This hypothesis was tested in a prospective clinical trial.	0.7796314156713536
Aim of study: Goal of this survey is to give an overview of anaesthesia for caesarean section in Germany.	0.6839725798173524
Ultrasound contrast agent is used in color Doppler flow imaging for signal enhancement in perfused vessels.	0.44684072439958766
We present our experience with its use in the head and neck area and the results obtained.	0.970931071687059
Up until now, 30 patients with carcinomas of the oral cavity or the maxillary sinus, tumors of the mandible and metastatic or inflammatory lymph nodes have been examined.	0.6745683920471934
Conventional B-scan sonography was supplemented by non-contrast color Doppler flow imaging.	0.4130167035143933
Depending on the indication, 2.5 g Levovist in bolus or 4 g fractionated was injected intravenously in a concentration of 300 or 400 mg/ml.	0.5936228781024959
The administration of the contrast agent was tolerated by all patients without any side effects and in all cases led to a remarkable enhancement of the Doppler signals.	0.8046576958448048
About 15 to 30 s after injection, an enhancement in perfused vessels was detected.	0.5048066636839321
The fractioned injection of 4 g led to a lengthening of signal enhancement up to more than 10 min and to the possibility of examining more parts with a single application of contrast agent.	0.6444316498369682
In 64% of the lymph nodes, vessels could only be identified with the administration of Levovist.	0.6150664654264175
The general vessel topography could be better evaluated in 83% of the cases.	0.5179894463134527
The lymph-node-supplying vessels were identified in 8 of 11 patients after the injection of contrast media.	0.7314886505133076
Additional information, which was gained in 17 patients, increased the certainty of diagnosis or of the therapeutic concept.	0.936705847338531
In three cases, the examinations with the signal enhancer resulted in a change in therapy.	0.6897007379547725
By applying signal enhancer in color Doppler sonography the fields of examination in the head and neck areas can be expanded.	0.4649921062227054
Non-syndromic neurosensory recessive deafness (NSRD) is one of the most common human sensory disorders.	0.6378469308891629
Mutations in the connexin 26 gene have been established as a major cause of inherited and sporadic non-syndromic deafness in different populations.	0.5590168287339481
Laser-induced thermotherapy is an in situ ablation method for the local treatment of liver tumors.	0.6641326952592235
The basic prerequisite for induction of adequate treatment volumes for clinical use was the development of a thermostable application system.	0.5258896976042436
In an ex vivo test series, the specially developed application system (diffuser tip) with 5760 J had a higher thermic loading capacity than the Ringmode applicator with 4200 J, thus enabling the induction of significantly larger lesions with a volume of 7.6 cm3.	0.5907620330105451
The results of a further in vivo test series demonstrated that the lesions were subject to a four-phase connective-tissue organization within a 6-month period.	0.7211876968000139
Furthermore, the same laser energy (4200 J) was associated with a significantly lower lesion volume of 2.5 cm3 in the in vivo than in the ex vivo test series.	0.7977901312409387
The influence of liver perfusion on the inducible lesion volume was examined in a further animal experimental study.	0.523947276119887
By temporarily interrupting hepatic blood perfusion (Pringle's maneuver) during laser application, the effective volume could be increased to 50.3 cm3 (P < 0.01) using an optical beam splitter.	0.5949755518097067
These results show that the technical prerequisites for reliable clinical application of laser-induced thermotherapy have been fulfilled.	0.6601394641863867
A total of 222 urogenital specimens were investigated with a commercially available polymerase chain reaction (Amplicor test) for the direct detection of Chlamydia trachomatis.	0.6278561220194935
The results were compared with those yielded by the conventional cell culture technique.	0.6261846999444434
Using cell culture a urogenital C. trachomatis infection could be detected in 72 of 222 patients.	0.5874352543520892
The Amplicor test yielded a positive result in 83.	0.3961802875267354
Referred to the detection rate of the Amplicor test and that of the cell culture, sensitivity was 91.2% for the test sensitivity and 79.1% for the cell culture.	0.8950760372701652
The specificity of both techniques was 100% when the specimens for which neither both nor either one of the tests gave positive results were considered.	0.6414684169059354
In accordance with other studies, this study suggests that tests based on nucleic acid amplification will supersede cell cultures as the gold standard for the detection of C. trachomatis and also become the method of choice in routine diagnosis of urogenital chamydial infections.	0.6525545807771689
Incidence and clinical significance of cardiopulmonary complications of acute cerebral lesions are still unclear.	0.5887796455055884
Neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) is characterized as an acute, protein-rich lung edema occurring shortly after cerebral lesions associated with an acute rise of intracranial pressure.	0.7113511225323045
NPE is infrequently diagnosed, usually in association with head trauma.	0.4925468629031574
Pathophysiological mechanisms include a rise of the pulmonary vascular hydrostatic pressure either due to sympathetic innervation with pulmonary vasoconstriction or increased left-atrial pressure following systemic arterial hypertension or an increase in pulmonary capillary permeability.	0.5316526135654323
In contrast to NPE, cardiac complications are frequently observed, most consistently in patients with subarachoid hemorrhage.	0.6898505392437961
Typical ECG changes are repolarization abnormalities, similar to those observed in coronary heart disease, and cardiac arrhythmias.	0.6552777819031053
The CK-MB may be slightly elevated; echocardiographic findings show a depressed left-ventricular function.	0.36805608344104207
Pathological examination reveals myofibrillar necrosis.	0.18702876198216437
Cardiac complications are explained with overactivity of the sympathetic innervation and high levels of circulating catecholamines.	0.48756947987652355
For adequate treatment, close cardiac monitoring is required in all patients with acute cerebral lesions.	0.9066873893273701
Benign, non-parasitic liver cysts are usually asymptomatic and found incidentally by abdominal ultrasound or CT scan.	0.37495783923871845
We present the case of a 68-year-old patient who showed obstructive jaundice due to a hemorrhagic liver cyst compressing the choledochal duct.	0.5516209293952549
Due to the location of the cyst in the porta hepatis with partial compression of central liver vessels and the meanwhile organized hematoma, operative therapy was preferred in order to prevent secondary complications such as portal vein thrombosis and to exclude a malignant neoplasm.	0.6387888468734126
This review summarizes briefly pathophysiology, clinical definitions, pathogenesis, risk factors, diagnostic procedures and principles of therapy and prophylaxis of ischemic stroke.	0.6972209820785511
Ischemic stroke is defined as a localized lack of cerebral perfusion mainly due to cardioembolic or arterial-embolic occlusion of cerebral arteries or hemodynamic or microangiographic reduction of cerebral blood flow.	0.480575882036646
We focused on pathophysiological mechanisms with potential clinical relevance as the role of oxygen and glucose concentration, the therapeutic time window, the role of excitatory neurotransmitters, Ca2+-influx, free radicals, and the development of ischemic brain edema.	0.6598811633329796
Based on this data the need of an urgent initiation of diagnostic workup and therapy is emphasized.	0.6398712974756136
This includes the early basic management with monitoring of blood pressure, ECG, oxygen and blood glucose concentration, and the balance of the water and electrolyte supply.	0.7043851738122736
Since specific therapeutic and prophylactic interventions are based on an exact diagnosis with respect to the pathogenesis, the need of an urgent diagnostic workup including clinical examination, laboratory baseline, vascular ultrasound, cranial CT-scan, ECG, and echocardiography is emphazised.	0.7583831286690829
Based on these results appropriate management of certain pathogenetic stroke subgroups is discussed.	0.4322481758131791
New data about the effectiveness of basic care, treatment of edema, neuroprotective agents, and thrombolysis is presented.	0.6357075134323833
Indications for the therapy with intravenous heparin, vitamin K-antagonists, antiplatelet drugs, and surgical procedures are summarized.	0.8231014342190928
Longitudinal osteocutaneous defects of the sternal region including the caudal third were reconstructed in 15 patients during a 3-year period by using the "vertical (VRAM)- and transverse rectus abdominis muscle" (TRAM) flap.	0.663074738799043
The majority of the defects resulted from chronic osteomyelitis after previous cardiothoracic surgery or were due to former therapy of breast cancer.	0.5293374882672212
Three VRAM/TRAM flaps were primarily transferred as free flaps with microvascular anastomosis in the axilla region.	0.33024433599531045
Nine out of 12 pedicled VRAM or TRAM flaps required an additional microvascular anastomosis because of imminent venous or arterial insufficency ("supercharging").	0.44158138397123364
Therefore, operative technique and operating time of the pedicled and free flap for reconstruction of longitudinal sternal defects are comparable.	0.6232568548168167
Adequate reconstruction and rehabilitation was achieved in 11 cases.	0.6967251478469171
In 2 patients revision and partial secondary defect coverage was required.	0.4124584473278215
Two male patients died postoperatively due to their preexisting condition.	0.48141613986015114
The introduction of joints in unilateral fixators enables these for multiple deformity corrections.	0.30516524824448304
Lengthening and shortening is achieved by changing the length of the fixator telescope.	0.4920229252767681
Axial corrections are performed by additive or subtractive techniques using uniplanar joints or by angulation procedures.	0.35314862665551777
Translation is done by direct movements of the bone fragments or by metaphyseal "double angulation".	0.5821744589576512
Derotation preferably is done as an acute procedure or in the "ring part" of a hybrid frame.	0.7268411671522602
Unilateral fixators are used to correct and temporarily stabilize until the correction is held by the nintramedullary nail.	0.4402426722225534
Pathomorphology in the preterm infant represents an interaction of morphological organ immaturity and neonatal management with their respective sequelae.	0.38691712162725195
Background: Morphological changes in the corneal surface after PRK may result not only in refraction fluctuations and reduction in visual acuity, but also in changes of contrast sensitivity.	0.6850076409733579
The aim of this study was to investigate whether PRK has an influence on contrast sensitivity with and without glare with a subsequent effect on the ability to drive cars.	0.6077769483145377
Calcifying obliterative atherosclerosis isolated within the descending thoracic aorta causing subtotal vascular occlusion was associated with symptoms such as in aortic coarctation in a 56-year-old patient.	0.46556502961481316
Remarkable in this unique case is the atypical and isolated manifestation of atherosclerotic disease within the thoracic aorta, as well as the tumorous extent of luminal calcification.	0.5171610178289535
Differential diagnostic considerations had to include calcifying tumor of the aorta, remnants after aortitis or secondary calcified aortic dissection.	0.5016679725204657
The osteoplastic frontal sinus surgery with obliteration of the sinus has been established in the therapy of frontal sinus diseases that can not be drainaged permanently or healed through an endonasal access.	0.5853038573706688
The obliteration of the frontal sinus is endangered in cases of multiple fracturing of the posterior frontal sinus wall or if it has been destroyed by an inflammatory process.	0.6591842441858972
In these problematic cases obliteration bears the danger of complications and cranialization of the frontal sinus is therefore the method of choice.	0.6223469663227466
We review 8 patients who were operated on using the cranialization technique.	0.5091423904546242
Indications for surgery were a combined fracture of the anterior and posterior frontal sinus wall (3), a pyocele of the front sinus with extensive destruction of the posterior wall (4) and a large osteoma of the posterior frontal sinus wall (1).	0.7440815572985329
The frontal sinus was exposed through a coronal incision, the mucosa and the posterior wall were completely removed and the frontal sinus obliterated with fat tissue.	0.7381066178139803
The anterior sinus wall was replaced after obliteration of the sinus or reconstructed with calvarian bone transplants.	0.42151003619559657
The follow up period was 1.8 years (11 months to 8 years).	0.8895320145246295
All patients underwent postoperatively a clinical ENT-examination and radiological assessment by CT-scan or MRI.	0.6323380718211443
The overall functional and esthetic outcome was excellent.	0.30453940621565034
There were no serious complications nor any recurrence.	0.523771059474494
The cranialization of the frontal sinus is a reliable and safe variation of the classical osteoplastic frontal sinus surgery with fat obliteration.	0.6676585606707311
We present the case of an infant with Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome, in whom keloids developed at the sites of intracutanous bleeding within 6 months after the illness.	0.7019842495478874
Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) belongs to the category of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA).	0.3980062763137863
The clinical picture is characterised by progressive ataxia and macular degeneration.	0.5200926029889057
Other common signs are slow saccades, external ophthalmoplegia, and pyramidal tract signs.	0.5055766872177211
The disease is caused by the expansion of an unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat in the gene for ataxin 7 on chromosome 3.	0.5974778650338735
SCA7 is a rare disorder.	0.7767750071173095
The first case in Germany was described only recently.	0.6878126935579749
We report two additional patients, father and son, with the molecular genetic diagnosis of SCA7.	0.75696617308948
The father carries a trinucleotide expansion of 42 CAG repeats, the son 51.	0.4070281635293469
Normal alleles range from 7 to 35 CAG repeats.	0.3070283265355647
Both patients show the typical picture with progressive ataxia and macular degeneration.	0.44154510387828105
We found a pronounced anticipation (earlier disease onset in subsequent generations), which is highly characteristic of CAG repeat disorders.	0.5765962536651371
In the following contribution the under-proportional participation rate of older workers in vocational training is analysized.	0.4766218102480775
Regarding the changes concerning the organiszation of vocational training to more job-integrated, self-directed and computerbased learning the consequences for training opportunities, motivation to learn and performance possibilities as well as institutional basic conditions to optimize the participation of elderly workers in further training are discussed.	0.41272099653435634
Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is the most severe arbovirus disease transmitted by ticks.	0.6783710043162743
The mortality of the central European form is 0.7-2%.	0.875107364367112
Active immunisation is recommended for endemic regions.	0.43036542188855664
We report on 4 patients with TBE aquired in Middle-Hessen between 1994 and 1997 (2 in 1997).	0.7475504967029676
After repeated CSF and serum testing the TBE-specific antibodies were found in all 4 cases.	0.5466897849778904
In one case there was also evidence for a prior infection with borrelia burgdorferi.	0.6488597429133657
The results of the initial CSF-analysis were atypical in 2 cases (high cell count of 136 cells/mm3, total protein up to 1.5 g/l).	0.7981891010126331
The endemic region for TBE has expanded in northern direction into Middle-Hessen, a region in which Lyme borreliosis is also endemic.	0.4194693261827861
Thus, true double infections are possible.	0.31966792985836306
This and the initially frequently atypical CSF-findings make the differential diagnosis difficult.	0.4525868841406613
Therefore, repetitive CSF and blood examinations are recommended.	0.4935509228565112
Nedocromil sodium and cromolyn sodium are non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of asthma.	0.49970458119061595
Although they are chemically different, there are many similarities in their mechanism of action.	0.6555083969907285
In provocation tests they have equal efficacy on some tests (allergen, exercise), but nedocromil sodium has greater effect on neuronal mechanisms such as So2 challenge.	0.4423258290985932
Very few studies compared the two drugs.	0.4283646818662584
In children, only one study was done, showing that twice daily nedocromil is as effective as four times daily cromolyn sodium.	0.5834837801381298
Thus twice daily administration is one advantage of nedocromil, the other being proven effect of steroid- sparing, which has not been shown with cromolyn sodium.	0.6636317487791363
Both drugs are recommended as first-line agents in mild persistent asthma.	0.583148645640802
Background: We evaluated in this retrospective study the impact of our diagnostic and therapeutic regimens - as illustrated by typical clinical pictures - on the frequency and prognostic values of postkeratoplasty complications in herpes eyes.	0.7758435055534899
The evaluation of brain tumor recurrence and therapy-induced benign changes following surgery and/or irradiation is a diagnostic challenge for imaging methods based on either morphology (cCT/MRI) or function (SPECT/PET).	0.6010861305609296
Current literature and the present data of our own patients demonstrate the diagnostic efficiency of IMT-SPECT and FDG-PET in the detection of recurrence and in-vivo grading.	0.6198308258549168
Thirty-nine patients suspected of brain tumor recurrence at follow-up were studied by FDG-PET and IMT-SPECT.	0.5971852500740497
Thirty-four of 39 patients showed recurrences; in 12 cases even a change in the grade of malignancy was observed.	0.6835168446207199
All high-grade recurrences could be confirmed by either methods.	0.6183193854711521
IMT-SPECT showed a higher sensitivity in detecting low-grade tumors at recurrence.	0.5885572173990732
In contrast to IMT-SPECT, FDG-PET supports sufficient in-vivo grading.	0.4913364067145484
Both methods can be used to differentiate between tumor recurrence and radionecrosis.	0.7169402310112883
In conclusion the results of our study demonstrate the efficiency of IMT-SPECT and FDG-PET in confirming recurrences and determining the actual tumor grade.	0.6134766935394739
A 22-year-old male presented with a submandibular cystic mass in the ENT Clinic of Berlin-Buch.	0.696605566561483
Histopathology revealed a dystopic papillary carcinoma in a thyroglossal duct cyst.	0.33748301082035637
Worldwide only about 150 cases are known.	0.27579516784041824
We describe our diagnostic and therapeutic procedures employed and included tumor excision, bilateral neck dissections and total thyroidectomy.	0.5615322778736237
No abnormalities in the thyroid gland but a metastatic carcinoma was uncovered in an ipsilateral lymph node in the jugular foramen area.	0.47761333494119346
A preoperative 99 Tc-thyroid scan and MRI study had not shown any evidence for a malignant tumor.	0.4365903855308247
The therapeutic approach advocated in literature is controversial but the intraoperative findings in our patient supported our decision to choose a relatively radical but not mutilating therapy.	0.523200890702776
Transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-1) is a pleiotrophic growth factor in carcinogenesis and regulars multiple cell functions.	0.5971125871928442
We wanted to evaluate the diagnostic meaning of TGF-1 plasma levels in patients with a biopsy proven prostate cancer.	0.6880645388897627
The TGF-1 blood level was analysed in 394 patients.	0.43815812306895446
In 242 patients (group I) the blood was taken before any prostate manipulation and biopsy.	0.7150398217304504
The TGF-1 plasma concentrations were almost similar in the group of patients with a prostate cancer (n = 157) and patients with a benign prostate hyperplasia (n = 85; 14 258 pg/ml versus 14 658 pg/ml, SD 10 516 pg/ml).	0.6923997401326963
In 152 patients the blood was taken 6-12 months after radical prostatectomy (group II).	0.6687289646569593
There was no significant difference between the patients with a PSA-progress and without PSA-progress after.	0.7631437196640376
Our results suggest that TGF-1 plasma levels can not be used to distinguish between patients with prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia.	0.6953982077400966
The aim of this study was to compare the psychological stress of patients with different forms of immediate type hypersensitivity and urticaria.	0.6924139399152027
Moreover, the patients' motivation for different forms of psychological treatment was assessed and an indication for psychosocial support was defined.	0.7865789345164748
228 consecutive inpatients with insect venom allergies (ins), food intolerance (food), drug hypersensitivities (dru) and urticaria (urt) were evaluated by validated questionnaires regarding psychological strain and motivation for psychosocial treatments.	0.6165372691879409
Patients with food intolerance and urticaria showed significantly elevated psychological stress and higher motivation for psychosocial support as compared to those with insect venom allergies and drug intolerance.	0.5380875201318297
Patient education was the favourite technique for the patients (food 78%, urt 57%, dru 24%, ins 17%), followed by relaxation treatment.	0.5241107639709173
The most important predictors for the motivation were the wish for self-responsibility, a feeling of helplessness and social limitations.	0.5531938989010611
If strong indication criteria are applied, psychosocial support is indicated in only small subgroups of each patient group.	0.5854099211171957
In spite of that, the management of allergic disease should consider the potential need for psychosocial support.	0.6219455062701982
The definition of endocrine disrupters is not very sharp.	0.4602407701798662
At present all non-physiologic substances which bind to steroid receptors, are defined as endocrine disrupters of which the best studied are estrogenic in nature.	0.4685137157233634
Many pesticides or insecticides or their metabolites have estrogenic activity and pollute our surface water.	0.2520735517337129
Here they may cause severe estrogenization of aquatic life.	0.41403598780594386
Only traces of these substances are demonstrable in drinking water.	0.4381613099293023
On the other hand, weak estrogens present in plastic ware may be ingested by men and therefore be potentially harmful for human health.	0.3368465881077558
On the other hand, many plants produce socalled'hyto-estrogens', particularly soy products are rich in phyto-estrogens but their high consumption in Asian populations are most likely the reason for reduced occurrence of breast cancer.	0.5041746882205149
Many plant extracts used for human medication also contain phyto-estrogens and are beneficial in the treatment of climacteric complaints.	0.37473004376451063
Hence, not all endocrine disruptors must be harmful to human health, in fact, some of them (clearly phyto-estrogens) may have beneficial effects.	0.6854308220164649
Germany's new Protection against infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz) will take effect on January 1, 2001.	0.4112645163511217
It will result in an increase of notifications on reportable infections.	0.530844135989543
Counties and states have to adjust the infrastructure of their reportable disease notification systems to meet the demands of the new legislation.	0.4498626266256668
An increased demand for human resources at the non-medical staff level is anticipated.	0.4311533649259742
Continuing education programs for medical and non-medical staff at public health offices are mandatory.	0.47124751776732493
Physicians in private practice, hospitals and diagnostic laboratories and leaders of nursing homes are target groups for special information.	0.44736009768173146
A timely review and epidemiological evaluation of all notifications forwarded by county health offices has to be performed at the state level.This is a prerogative for immediate response in case of non-localized increases in reported disease incidence.	0.5873768028191212
The author advocates the development of an epidemiological rapid reaction scheme (epidemiological fire brigade) in which public health physicians at the county, state, and federal level cooperate in a gradual response to outbreak situations according to actual demand.	0.5718330933081789
We report on an 8 year old boy and a 12 year old girl with intermittent peranal loss of blood and mucus, impaired defecation and recurrent abdominal pain.	0.6768205951302136
On endoscopy isolated ulcers were seen in the rectum only, whereas the colonic mucosa appeared to be normal macroscopically and microscopically.	0.5764239869175529
Biopsies from the borders of the ulcers revealed a hyperplasia of the lamina muscularis mucosae and a fibromuscular obliteration of the lamina propria mucosae.	0.5253795696259065
These clinical, endoscopical and histological findings are characteristic for the solitary rectal ulcer syndrome.	0.44911610288685694
Only 26 paediatric cases (age at diagnosis 6-9 years) have been published so far.	0.798832157612668
The interval from first symptoms to final diagnosis (mean: 3,7 years, range: 1 week to 9 years) is remarkably long in childhood cases.	0.8154739930866548
Pathogenetically an internal rectal prolapse with secondary ischemic lesions is assumed.	0.2763589791638094
There is no evidence of an association to inflammatory bowel disease.	0.733859586761367
The ulcers ars often resistant to different medical and surgical options.	0.46900067234546156
Discussion: Pediatricians should be aware of the solitary rectal ulcer syndrome in order to make an earlier diagnosis and to prevent unnecessary diagnostic procedures and concerns of patients and their parents about more severe illnesses.	0.6096654036153017
A typology of chronic illness in childhood and adolescence is developed.	0.4048171942752324
In a comparative analysis of 29 studies, maximal androgen deprivation (MAD) was not found to be superior to partial androgen deprivation.	0.6503995341395886
Thus, MAD cannot be regarded as the new gold standard.	0.5288751225205922
Most trials focus on quality of life which - given the palliative aim of the treatment - deserves special attention.	0.7649191699404295
This aspect has not yet been evaluated, however, in the largest multicenter study, Intergroup study 0105.	0.6042950219007694
In patients with advanced bone metastasis or severe pain, MAD treatment should be begun because of the flare phenomenon.	0.6528136973875673
The synergistic effects of LHRH agonists on the prostate are currently being investigated.	0.43631280836300423
Since no clear prognostic factors exist and reduction of serum-PSA levels under MAD does not delay progression, the patient must help to make the decision of whether or not MAD should be begun.	0.6425031303270159
A case of generalized maculopapular rash and local indurated plaques following s.c. injections of either low-molecular-weight heparin or conventional (high-molecular-weight) heparin to a 75-year-old woman is reported.	0.5528059779587268
This rare reaction is described and the literature to date is reviewed.	0.7971820085095216
Perioperative morbidity and mortality in noncardiac surgery are mainly due to cardiovascular complications.	0.47451007461831846
Therefore, perioperative risk assessment is crucial to avoid these adverse events.	0.6437399486763028
In patients above the age of 40 years, the ECG is a basic investigation, often providing hints for cardiovascular diseases.	0.7002951044555797
Stress testing and, in special cases, stress echocardiography or scintigraphy (the latter only in those patients, in which exercise is impossible) can detect significant coronary artery disease.	0.7958855959194195
The vascularization reduced the perioperative risk in particular in those patients with unstable angina or severe coronary artery disease.	0.7592624361851457
However, prophylactic revascularization the stable patient does not improve overall outcome, because the risk of the revascularizing procedure must be added to the risk of noncardiac surgery.	0.6511810435784695
Other diagnostic procedures like echocardiography, chest roentgenogram, routine scintigraphy, halter ECG or halter blood pressure measurement do not add information to the perioperative risk assessment, although these techniques might be very relevant in evaluating other coexisting diseases (heart failure; valve lesions, in particular aortic stenoses etc.)	0.6430738286222564
and can be useful to improve medical treatment preoperatively (e.g.	0.4866562259342699
normalization of blood pressure).	0.4961871800767213
A verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder (pT4N0M0, G1) developed in a 66-year-old woman who had been suffering from interstitial cystitis with Hunner's ulcer for 10 years.	0.5363399724609534
Up to now, only 7 cases of verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder unassociated with bilharzial cystitis have been reported.	0.606276768810067
Although the development of a verrucous carcinoma as a complication of interstitial cystitis has not been reported so far, the authors regard the chronic irritation of the bladder to be the most important etiologic factor for the malignant transformation.	0.7884269376181714
After conservative management had failed, a radical cystectomy with supravesical urinary diversion was performed.	0.43395961531725424
The characteristics of interstitial cystitis, verrucous carcinoma and surgical management are discussed.	0.43705893110856564
Introduction: Abdominal actinomycosis is an uncommon disease.	0.5507612534044226
Nevertheless it should be considered in case of unclear tumor-like abdominal masses.	0.7170311061646186
Methods: We report a case of a 49-year-old patient with an intrauterine device.	0.8419535710317693
The patient was submitted with a solid and painful tumor in the upper abdomen.	0.7180202756898664
After sonography, computerized tomography, gastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy the preoperative presumptive diagnosis was a carcinoma of the transvers colon invading the abdominal wall.	0.42500382528930003
Pathological examination after a right hemicolectomy surprisingly revealed an actinomycosis.	0.3355745302699049
Results: Based on this case diagnostic tools and therapeutic options of actinomycosis of the colon are discussed.	0.7226147180810818
Conclusions: This case illustrates the importance to consider the possibility of actinomycosis when finding an unclear abdominal mass.	0.5873042044572591
After a surgical excision an abdominal actinomycosis requires antibiotic therapy.	0.3203907644105554
Long-term treatment of patients with chronic schizophrenias requires integration of many therapeutic approaches, co-operation of several professions, and regard for the views of patients and relatives.	0.7281316234666119

Continuous neuroleptic treatment is indispensable in most cases to achieve social integration.	0.4777325926705362
Indications for adding on antidepressants, lithium, carbamazepine, benzodiazepines and other drugs are discussed, as well as treatment of negative symptoms, depression and management of treatment-resistant symptoms.	0.5058861716988977
Psychotherapy needs to regard the possibilities of the patient.	0.531371975471161
In the context of a stable long-term relationship, the patient is supported in experiencing himself as a subject capable of action.	0.7354130384642819
Effectiveness of cognitive treatments to date is limited.	0.37719922947945533
The best results are achieved by social skills training.	0.48172740664455593
Social therapy, which aims at the improvement of functional aspects of the patient, is of paramount importance.	0.8083839271663016
Improved possibilities for work rehabilitation are contrasted by difficulties in financing long-term social rehabilitation.	0.37094781842801483
Interventions based on the EE concept are highly effective, but are rarely used.	0.6756184018938124
Programs that merely convey information without targeting behaviour modification are ineffective.	0.1998030756805127
The functions of facilities of treatment in the community are explained, the integrative role of case-management is stressed.	0.680064259314058
The effect of a locally applied peppermint oil preparation on tension-type headache was examined in the design of a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind crossover study for the first time.	0.5932720274187925
The preparation was tested against both the reference substance acetaminophen and to the corresponding placebo.	0.6226222712560991
The liquid test preparation contained 10 g of peppermint oil and ethanol (90 %) ad 100 (test preparation LI 170, Lichtwer Pharma, Berlin); the placebo was a 90 % ethanol solution to which traces of peppermint oil were added for blinding purposes.	0.5171384082219403
The reference preparation contained 500 mg acetaminophen; the placebo tablet was identical to the verum in size and appearance.	0.49591533384834374
The study included the analysis of 164 headache attacks of 41 patients of both sexes ranging between 18 and 65 years of age, suffering from tension-type headache in accordance with the IHS classification.	0.5778782303911381
Four headache episodes per patient were treated in a double-blind, randomized crossover design.	0.5435890046243403
Each headache attack was treated by the application of 2 capsules of the oral medication (1000 mg of acetaminophen or placebo) and the cutaneous application of the oil preparation (peppermint oil or placebo solution).	0.6799731404772088
The oil was spread largely across forehead and temples which was repeated after 15 and 30 minutes.	0.33592210881932233
Using a headache diary, the headache parameters were assessed after 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes.	0.664626497819029
Compared to the application of placebo, a 10 % peppermint oil in ethanol solution significantly reduced the clinical headache intensity already after 15 minutes (p < 0.01).	0.5329839232245014
This significant clinical reduction of the pain intensity continued over the one hour observation period.	0.5215632275406403
Acetaminophen, too, proved to be efficient compared to placebo (p < 0.01).	0.5263412224468574
There was no significant difference between the efficacy of 1000 mg of acetaminophen and 10 % peppermint oil in ethanol solution.	0.4683764017433858
Simultaneous application of 1000 mg of acetaminophen and 10 % peppermint oil in ethanol solution leads to an additive effect which remains below the significance threshold, however.	0.5240151019446635
The patients reported no adverse events.	0.3676825557427449
This controlled study showed for the first time that a 10 % peppermint oil in ethanol solution efficiently alleviates tension-type headache.	0.521582944934017
Peppermint oil thus proves to be a well-tolerated and cost-effective alternative to usual therapies.	0.6763732050002115
The positive results of several multi-center studies significantly improved the immunomodulatory treatment of multiple sclerosis over the last few years.	0.6352119779129027
It was demonstrated that different compounds are capable to reduce the number of relapses and to modulate the progression of disease.	0.5076826092883742
To improve the transition of results obtained in these studies into daily clinical practice, a consensus group started to prepare a report on the current treatment options for the German-speaking European countries.	0.7950423414048711
The aim of this paper is to summarize the current knowledge, compare the results of recent clinical trials with the experience from other  therapeutic options and assess their clinical evidence.	0.7636868384232526
Dislocated metacarpal V fractures, fixed by percutaneous Kirschner wires or other implants near the metacarpophalangeal joint, often show impaired movement despite excellent radiologic findings.	0.4190833590259654
We therefore chose an alternative method using intramedullary Kirschner wire osteosynthesis according to Foucher.	0.34238592563952525
Twenty-five patients were operated on in a 3-year period and movement of the fingers and complications were examined.	0.8094757242486961
Six weeks after operation all fractures were consolidated in anatomical reduction.	0.5338431968909746
One patient suffering from an early stage of Sudeck's dystrophy was healed, and no other complications appeared.	0.7419862499937123
Three months after treatment all patients achieved free movement of the fingers with anatomical alignment.	0.6795330036173134
We therefore recommend intramedullary Kirschner wire osteosynthesis in distal metacarpal V fractures.	0.4014699347179598
Aspiration of toxic substances, foreign material, bacterially contaminated secretions, or water (near-drowning) either immediately leads to cessation of respiration or to impaired ventilation due to airway obstruction, it causes hypoxia due to surfactant dysfunction, and pulmonary infection might develop.	0.5488154172289283
Respiratory insufficiency is the resulting consequence which needs immediate and appropriate therapy and intervention.	0.3589028421109822
The knowledge of risk factors that promote aspiration injury is important for its prevention and limitation.	0.5866438694126558
Mortality varies between 3 and 70% depending on patients studied, and on the nature and amount of aspirated material.	0.6605977295234278
The major cause of death is acute respiratory failure.	0.45878863434180495
The onset of injury to the lung after aspiration is very rapid.	0.5002645706269605
Therefore, therapeutic interventions like bronchoscopy are often too late.	0.4691737443956776
More importantly, oxygenation should be monitored continuously for timely institution of mechanical ventilation.	0.4379496089560452
Antibiotics should not be given routinely but a calculated regime is neccessary when signs of infection develop.	0.4856045333424787
Prognosis in near-drowning considerably depends on early rescue and successful resuscitation.	0.40130737715313974
A rapid onset of cerebral hypothermia during the accident can help to increase the ischemic tolerance of the brain and makes it neccessary to continue advanced life support until rewarming of the near-drowning victim.	0.5649466580529197
Anticipation of individual outcome in unconscious patients is difficult.	0.3585071404071828
One third of them survive with a moderate to severe neurologic damage.	0.4786023300061021
The overall mortality of near-drowning is about 11%.	0.4770937315102881
Pathophysiological aspects, diagnostic procedures, pratical management and possible prophylaxis of aspiration injuries will be discussed.	0.5047683569996153
Background: Semiquantitative classification of corneal topography after penetrating keratoplasty has the potential for focusing information about the areal dioptric power of the cornea.	0.6021663963103128
The purpose of this study was to objectify the procedure of manual semiquantitative classification using a Fourier transform of corneal topography power data and to correlate both methods.	0.5229864358513379
Recently, professional anaesthesiologists organizations, have set up recommendations for intraoperative monitoring.	0.547131721496635
These recommendations are based upon the assumption that anaesthesia-related deaths are largely preventable and that extensive monitoring will reduce mortality.	0.5257090340081472
Hypoxaemia appears to be an important pathophysiological mechanism, and this is why oxygen monitoring is given a high priority in safety standards in anaesthesia.	0.6926329839605477
However, no reduction in mortality has been definitively shown to follow the use of any monitoring device in randomized, controlled trials.	0.7215880118706453
Four techniques of oxygen monitoring are discussed and evaluated.	0.4499154457850838
Oxygen monitoring during inspiration can be recommended, although its implementation will probably prevent only a few anaesthesia-related deaths.	0.6583539121881818
Pulse oximetry is certainly highly recommended, but also has some deficiencies which are not sufficiently well known considering the popularity of this technique.	0.676514467966225
Transcutaneous PO2 is considered mainly for historical reasons.	0.22448917348636016
Near infrared spectrometry is a new technique offering noninvasive and continuous monitoring of intracerebral oxygenation.	0.5928299617719589
The increasing frequency of stent implantation into coronary arteries is based mainly on assumptions.	0.4638174370377909
One of these assumptions is that stents may prevent restenosis.	0.489838962821459
Stents can prevent restenosis as has been shown in two randomized studies (Stress I and Benestent I), but only in large (> 3.0mm) vessels with short denovo lesions.	0.7368675876461521
Despite the very tight selection of patients suitable for stent implantation in these two studies, the advantage for stents remained small (about 10% less restenosis) and appeared to decrease with time following intervention.	0.6554181294431028
There is increasing concern about the extension of stenting in an "unrestricted strategy".	0.4774743719998375
This concern was expressed in the ACC Expert Consensus Document which was published recently (JACC 28, No 3, September 1996: 782-794.	0.49022097078950116
Based on the lack of data for most of the presently used stent indications the expert group recommended a more selective strategy for the implantation of stents into coronary arteries.	0.5788154509535415
Removal of the arterial sheath immediately after PTCA is desirable for patients, reduces the medical staff's workload, and may decrease hospital costs due to a shortened length of stay.	0.7090475598301622
Although the safety and efficacy of the hemostatic systems used especially for the above purpose have been sufficiently documented, inadvertent intraluminal vascular occlusion is theoretically possible.	0.436826572146113
While partial or complete arterial occlusion in conjunction with the VasoSeal collagen prototype device has been previously reported, similar complications occurring with the Angio-SealTM device were not published.	0.46950335377717617
In this report, we describe a 54-year old female patient (height: 150 cm, weight: 42.5 kg) who was transferred for PTCA following an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction.	0.6947280111828138
Immediately after PTCA, the Angio-SealTM device was deployed utilizing standard technique.	0.5184545993010587
No difficulties were encountered during device deployment, however, immediately following device placement active arterial bleeding occurred.	0.3420437824315059
Due to the inadequacy of hemostasis, heparin was reversed with protamine to avoid further hemorrhagic complications.	0.3888689583060091
Following this, the desired hemostasis quickly occurred, but the patient soon complained about symptoms suggestive of an acute occlusion of the right femoral artery.	0.8415776177854596
Unsatisfactory attempts as lysis resulted in the patient being transferred to vascular surgery.	0.505485968578516
The complete Angio-SealTM system (anchor including collagen) was located intravasculary, and removed during surgery.	0.586656265494266
Deviations in the axes can be physiological or pathological.	0.29903995076547457
During growth, the axes of the lower extremities undergo significant changes.	0.6841785900275991
The femoral neck-shaft-angle decreases from 150 ° on average at birth to 120 ° on average at the end of growth.	0.5506071957159555
The lower leg is bowed in a varus direction at birth.	0.4205468229599633
On the basis of an extensive literature search (DIMDI, MEDLINE - status at June 1992), the causes of contact urticaria so far known are displayed in tables.	0.566112097029875
The contact urticariogens can be divided into (1) chemically defined substances and (2) chemically undefined biological materials.	0.5355530097415818
The causes most frequently encountered in 16 professions are given.	0.4435344605773011
Numerous agents are known for medical professions (physicians, nurses, dentists and dental technicians, veterinary surgeons).	0.3801047477879714
Today, the most frequent single cause of contact urticaria is probably the presence of latex proteins in rubber (gloves, condoms, tubes, balloons, etc.).	0.569351225588896
When testing is performed a stepwise approach is recommended for safety reasons (rub test, prick test, scratch chamber test).	0.4759979559422421
For some contact urticariogens a commercial radioallergosorbent test (RAST) is available.	0.48377404764966214
In the cases reported in the literature it is not always possible to decide definitely whether the pathogenetic mechanism was immunologic (IgE mediated) or non-immunologic (toxic or pseudoallergic).	0.6316577814696642
When there is a high degree of sensitization (e.g.	0.5437718919324704
to latex) professional activities must be severely restricted, or even completely discontinued in rare cases.	0.4817143398551681
Purpose: To find and describe potential MRI criteria of nutrient vessel canals of carpal bones.	0.4260000661157794
2-Agonists are being used increasingly in anaesthesia and intensive care medicine because of their antihypertensive, analgesic and sedative properties.	0.6520067004202038
Platelets bear 2-receptors on the cell surface.	0.33892945115378986
Stimulation of these receptors by agonists induces platelet aggregation.	0.4218396305364075
The present study examined whether in vitro incubation of blood with the 2-agonists clonidine and dexmedetomidine decreases 2-receptor density and hereby influences platelet aggregation.	0.5578423905841646
Prehospital diagnosis and first line therapy of acute chest pain are among the most frequently encountered challenges for general practitioners and emergency physicians.	0.7055815222334371
Acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndromes in general are present in about a third of patients complaining of acute chest pain.	0.6104214807073159
The basis of first line therapy is the understanding of the pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia, the clinical symptoms, the diagnostic tools and the preclinically available therapeutic options.	0.9050110109364837
Time is the most critical factor in myocardial ischemia and subsequent infarction with irreversible injury of subendocardial cells starting within 30-60 minutes of total myocardial ischemia and with transmural infarction becoming complete in 3 to 6 hours.	0.6243963519422635
With 30% of patients dying within the first hour of ischemia mostly due to ventricular arrhyhtmias every effort needs to be made to shorten the delay between symptom onset and start of reperfusion therapy.	0.6870659414347233
The present overview concentrates on the armamentarium of preclincial diagnosis and the options of first line therapy of myocardial infarction with the aim of a short transport time to the hospital and therefore a short delay to more specific therapies like thrombolysis or PTCA.	0.6984478971742731
The aim of surgical intervention in the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is the achievement of normocalcemia and euparathyreosis.	0.7698840599303782
Despite improved diagnostic procedures containing comparatively modified pre- and intraoperative methods to determine the position of the parathyroid glands and the most efficient operative technique including minimal-invasive surgery thereof, success cannot be guaranteed.	0.5811626548854855
Therefore, we should strive to avoid reintervention by ensuring a hemorrhage-free, atraumatic, anatomical-orientated operation and providing positive preconditions for reoperation.	0.5247560106036979
Success is based on the four pillars of the HPT surgery: history, embryology with anatomy, neck surgery and experience.	0.4536681716038075
By means of this principle and the results of surgical treatment in 1634 patients with pHPT from 1982 until 1998, we demonstrate a standardized operative technique of pHPT.	0.6747209548849967
A 67-year-old male patient presented with a nephrotic syndrome.	0.6074111770281921
Biopsy of the kidney revealed the characteristic of fibrillary glo-merulopathy on light and electron micros-copy.	0.41914485667641294
Other non-nephritic causes of a nephrotic syndrome (e.g.	0.3171712870419504
amyloidosis, immunotactoid glomerulopathy, light-chain glomerulopathy, cryoglobulinaemia, collagen-III glomerulopathy, fibronectin glomerulopathy) could be excluded.	0.49760406000465424
Besides the case report, differential diagnosis of fibrillary glomerulopathies is presented.	0.6038811285602194
Two patients were infected with sporotrichosis; one had the fixed cutaneous form, the other the lymphocutaneous form.	0.71237158204007
Sporotrichosis schenckii was identified in both with a culture from a tissue biopsy.	0.39078605064371036
Both patients were successfully treated with itraconazole, one received 100 mg and the other 200 mg itraconazole daily over a 3 months period.	0.6460083267862416
Abstract   Mitoxantrone is an anthracenedione antineoplastic agent that has recently been shown to be effective in ameliorating disease activity in multiple sclerosis (MS) as indicated by clinical and MRI data.	0.5526200125270885
However, the role of mitoxantrone in escalating treatment of patients with frequent and severe relapses and with rapid progression of disability is less clear.	0.5616385800993734
In this retrospective analysis we report on 15 patients with severe relapsing-remitting (9 patients) and secondary progressive MS with superimposed exacerbations (6 patients) treated openlabeled with mitoxantrone in our Clinical Research Group from July 1994 to October 1998.	0.8237775225751586
Eleven of these patients (73%) were treated with azathioprine, interferon-beta-1b or cyclophosphamide before.	0.7469942215196502
The patients received mitoxantrone over a period of at least 12 months (19 +/- 6 months) with a single dose of 10 mg/m2 monthly for the first three months.	0.9336331056116591
Thereafter, infusions were repeated every 3 months (total dose 141 mg +/- 45 mg).	0.5090305849642821
The annual relapse rate could be significantly reduced from 3,0 +/- 1,5 in the year before therapy to 0,5 +/- 0,5 during therapy.	0.7791805312835292
Nine patients (60%) were stabilised, while four patients (27%) showed an improvement of disability.	0.9532370399897245
The treatment was well tolerated with only minor side effects.	0.5268316926556773
These results although retrospectively obtained confirm previous trials showing that mitoxantrone may be useful in MS patients with frequent and severe exacerbations and/or a rapidly progressive course of the disease who have had other immunomodulatory medication.	0.5933181748372213
Interstitial cystitis (IC) represents a rare and complex inflammatory bladder condition in which diagnostics can be challenging.	0.47273281947623985
Strict NIH criteria for its diagnosis were designed for research purposes.	0.3729309837408667
Their routine application would miss large proportions of IC patients.	0.2615737260278129
When IC is suspected, history and physical exam are followed by an evaluation of long-term voiding diaries.	0.5624194437855803
Large voided volumes (functional capacity >250 cc) or longer micturition intervals (>2 h.), absence of nocturia or symptom-free periods reduce the likelihood of IC.	0.6422395236556291
Further exclusion diagnostics include urine tests (infection), cytology (in-situ carcinoma), ultrasound (calculi, bulks, anomalies) and urodynamics in selected cases.	0.5410626918564445
Bladder capacity measurements under sedoanalgesia are of limited value, since functional low-volume bladders can be mechanically extendable.	0.44388667688844485
Cystoscopy under general anesthesia represents the diagnostic standard procedure for IC during which 90% of IC-patients present with characteristic mucosal glomerulations after bladder distension.	0.5050674463510546
Biopsies are recommended for exclusion of malignancy.	0.45604929620927015
Potassium-leak testing plays no relevant role in routine diagnostics due to its poor sensitivity.	0.38152468675558626
Similarly, complex determinations of novel IC markers (histamine, tryptase, cytokines, growth factors, substance P, nitric oxide) are of no relevance in clinical settings and should be restricted to research projects.	0.5533388293650213
According to semiotics, which may be defined as the doctrine of the essential nature and fundamental varieties of signs, objects, and interpretants, pain is considered to be a sign (significant) with very different meanings (significance) either as a naturalistic symptom (of disease) or as a symbol used in a metaphorical context.	0.7361515451476626
When following this methodological perspective it is possible to interpret medical as well as poetic writings on equal terms.	0.41034933106921534
In Graeco-Roman medical texts pain was mostly understood as a result and an indicator of disease, but nonetheless as a symptom which seemed to be actively produced by the affected body.	0.6289752537333391
Especially in the Corpus Hippocraticum dating from the 5th and 4th century B. C. this materialistic and at the same time psychosomatic attitude can be noticed.	0.4931059332918107
Aristotle (4th century B. C.), Celsus (1st century A. D.), and the famous experimental physiologist Galen (2nd century A. D.) agreed that pain was a sign of evil which should be fought without exception.	0.5184156969027458
It was Galen who added the disturbance of function (functio laesa) as the fifth cardinal sign of inflammation to the four well-known cardinal signs of Celsus (rubor, calor, tumor, dolor).	0.5875610737212649
He also coined the term µK to characterize an attack of migraine.	0.2701899167742684
In algotherapy, Galen used a complex pharmacological system which was based upon the four cardinal qualities of humoral pathology.	0.42296791886719626
On the other hand, pain was designed as a multi-dimensional symbol by the famous Graeco-Roman epic poets.	0.4870848870784666
In Homer's Odyssey (8th century B. C.), pain appears transformed into the shape of a scar which is visible and palpable on the hero's leg like an identification tag, whereas in Virgil's Aeneids (1st century B. C.) pain symbolizes weakness and defencelessness which can only be alleviated by the goddess Venus.	0.47167030085984474
In this article current indications and limitations of neuromuscular monitoring are reviewed.	0.6259921379041451
Attention is mainly focused on detection of residual curarisation.	0.34923486492574873
New insights in the pathophysiological consequences of residual neuromuscular blockade and the actual criteria of complete recovery are discussed.	0.5190486124367992
Surprisingly in this context, despite the benefit of neuromuscular monitoring, its utilisation in clinical practice is rather an exception than the routine.	0.6714797235746601
A lack of standardisation of neuromuscular monitoring is probably the major problem on the way to a widespread utilisation of the monitoring.	0.6250847760636558
Three patients presented with an acquired green discoloration of their scalp hair.	0.49634785001429493
History revealed that all of them swam regularly in private swimming pools.	0.39174852811030714
Examination of the hair by atomic emission spectroscopy showed that the green discoloration was caused by an excessively high copper content of the hair.	0.6845041373442922
This exogeneous discoloration is characteristically related to the uptake of copper from private swimming pools.	0.3814944918881584
A 62-year-old female patient presented with bullous, intensely itching cutaneous lesions, which clinically and histopathologically resembled dermatitis herpetiformis (Duhring's disease).	0.49229534860243274
Therapy with DADPS was unsuccessful.	0.19205365203997493
Because of associated cervical lymph node enlargement and splenomegaly, a lymph node biopsy was taken.	0.5454888235999266
Histopathology of a lymph node and of the bone marrow confirmed the diagnosis: angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy (AILD)-type T-cell lymphoma.	0.7250470004070577
Intensely pruritic associated skin eruptions are typical for this peculiar kind of lymphoma.	0.3404093416778601
These skin lesions are due to inflammatory cells and not to neoplastic infiltrations.	0.47391159614590933
This case report is the first report of AILD with bullous skin lesions to appear in the literature.	0.6346377369122993
Background: The procedures for prophylaxis and treatment of keratopathy following facial palsy with lagophthalmos are unsatisfying from the functional point of view.	0.5266839552849426
The purpose of our study was to compare the diagnostic performance of a 0.2-T MRI unit and a 1.0-T MRI unit in the evaluation of the anterior cruciate ligament in patients with clinically suspected lesions of this ligament.	0.7781962298477598
Twenty four patients with clinically suspected lesions of the anterior cruciate ligament underwent MRI of the knee on both 0.2-T and 1.0-T MRI units.	0.832118076138236
Three independent observers evaluated the examinations for primary and secondary signs of a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament.	0.5698895273481434
Frequency of these signs was determined for both modalities, and observer agreement was assessed using the kappa statistic.	0.5935101402852343
Sixteen of 24 patients had signs of tears of the anterior cruciate ligament on the 1.0-T unit; the 0.2-T unit detected primary signs in 15/16 (93 %) patients and secondary signs in 7/12 (43 %) patients.	0.7428964039427964
In 8 patients the 1.0 T unit showed neither primary nor secondary signs for tears of the anterior cruciate ligament; in these patients the 0.2-T unit detected primary signs in 1/8 cases (12 %), and secondary signs in 3/8 cases (37 %).	0.7319185296492513
Observer agreement was very good for the 1.0-T unit and fair for the 0.2-T unit.	0.6248578811869745
There is no substantial difference between 1.0-T units and 0.2-T MRI units in the visualisation of primary signs of tears of the anterior cruciate ligament.	0.709140295934033
In the visualisation of secondary signs, 1.0-T units are superior to 0.2-T units, and there is a surprisingly high rate of false-positive results with the 0.2-T unit.	0.886341586406168
As to the reproducibility of the results, the 1.0-T unit is far superior to the 0.2-T unit.	0.8281237662863251
Purpose of our study was to develop a reliable model to define clinical stage I nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT) being at low risk and at high risk for occult retroperitoneal metastases based on pathohistological and immunohistochemical parameters in order to stratify the therapeutic approach.	0.615077933335073
3-5 paraffin-embedded formalin fixed tissue blocks of 149 clinical stage I NSGCT were available from all patients and were analyzed for histopathological features associated with pathological stage: presence/absence of vascular invasion, presence/absence of tunical invasion, percentage of each histological cell type present in the primary tumor.	0.5892709452256452
Immunohistochemical expression of MIB-1, p53, bcl-2, cathepsin D and e-cadherin was evaluated using a semiquantitative scoring ystem.	0.43613142484660444
Statistical analysis was performed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression models.	0.5410232096633906
Percentage of embryonal carcinoma [%EC (p < 0.001)] and presence of vascular invasion [VI (p < 0.0001)] were the most significant independent risk factors associated with pathological stage II disease.	0.6336841636003475
Combination of %EC and VI allowed correct prediction of final pathological stage in 88 % of patients.	0.6250665385000989
Cut-off values including both variables identified correct pathological stage in 131/149 patients (88 %).	0.478758278294305
Less than 45 % EC and absence of VI correctly identified pathological stage I disease in 91.5 %; more than 80 % EC and presence of VI correctly predicted pathological stage II in 88 % of the patients.	0.6696473204022111
%EC and presence/absence of VI appear to be reliable prognosticators to identify both patients at high risk and at low risk for occult retroperitoneal disease.	0.5788593257710237
P53, bcl-2, MIB-1, cathepsin D and e-cadherin did not appear to be of prognostic value in clinical stage I NSGCT.	0.5417957862959693
In the framework of rheumatic illnesses, the lungs and pleura are often observed to be involved.	0.6592268025274869
Dependent on the basic illness in question, conditions of the bronchoalveolar system, vessels, lymphatic system, and pleura that have developed differently inter- and intraindividually can be diagnosed in toporegionally variable forms and combinations.	0.66208499771193
In the causal pathogenesis, the initial (auto-)immunological alteration of the alveolar septa plays a role.	0.7442867217000031
When the monocytes, macrophages, and fibroblasts are activated, as a result of a chronic inflammatory process there is increasing reparative proliferation, which finally leads to the nonspecific end stage of irreversible interstitial fibrosis.	0.754368078915858
The incidence and manifestation forms of lung changes show certain differences dependent on the underyling illness (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, progressive systemic scleroderma, dermatomyositis and polymyositis, Sjögren syndrome, and mixed connective tissue disease).	0.549742201688141
In addition to vasculitis and granulomatosis of the lung, therapy-induced lung changes must also be considered in the differential diagnosis since almost all basic therapeutic agents can cause this type of lung condition.	0.6385719699238104
Good knowledge of the parameters from the viewpoint of possible therapeutic measures is indispensable, as is close cooperation between the treating physician and the pathologist.	0.622794470046998
Scintigraphic imaging identifies pathophysiological processes; in other words it assesses regional perfusion, permeability, leukocytic accumulation and bone turnover.	0.4409857296049175
These processes precede morphological changes and this accounts for the high sensitivity of nuclear medicine procedures as well as the low specificity for the differential diagnosis of different diseases with similar pathophysiological characteristics.	0.6495158334181348
This review (1) describes and evaluates the currently used scintigraphic procedures, (2) suggests their differential use in certain clinical settings in comparison with alternative radiological methods and (3) addresses new developments in diagnosis using nuclear medicine procedures.	0.577590163138509
In summary, we advise dynamic bone scanning as a primary scintigraphic investigation.	0.5607350220995745
A negative scan excludes osteomyelitis in most cases.	0.3371313841077789
The comparison is made with conventional radiology and clinical history.	0.3992232105983842
In cases with short clinical histories ( = granulocytic inflammation), leukocyte scintigraphy should be the next diagnostic step; in chronic processes (lymphomonocytic inflammation), gallium scintigraphy is advisable.	0.6412956264163628
Other scintigraphic methods might be of additional use in experienced hands.	0.4308250203692496
SPECT is useful for clarifying inconclusive planar scans of the head, spine and large joints.	0.5041407553243283
To assess the clinical effectiveness of glaucoma therapy with diode laser cyclophotocoagulation, 106 eyes (51 eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma, 22 eyes with secondary glaucoma, 10 eyes with narrow-angle glaucoma, 23 eyes with other glaucomas) of 87 patients were treated.	0.6396284625955339
Using a diode laser coupled with a fiberoptic probe, ending in a focusing tip, all eyes were treated with 24-30 spots over 360  ° and 2.8-3.6 J of energy, 1.5 mm posterior to the limbus.	0.7690526705692757
The intraocular pressure was obtained over a period of time until 8-24 months after operation.	0.6449656748953561
Additionally, morphological changes of the ciliary body were observed in 25 eyes by means of ultrasound biomicroscopy.	0.6133544969553852
Our objective was to determine the efficacy of ESWL treatment in children and the extent of auxiliary measures.	0.6805535974938294
In a retrospective analysis we investigated number of auxiliary measures and the stone-free rate in children after ESWL treatment.	0.5717309819178681
We report a 44-year-old female patient who underwent surgery because of a suspected primary tumor of the renal pelvis in imaging procedures.	0.8798824947472202
Histology revealed the diagnosis of mesoblastic nephroma.	0.4208758332235024
This tumor represents a special entity of nephroblastoma that rarely occurs in adults.	0.30897607088000356
There is no unanimous opinion on the biological behavior of mesoblastic nephroma because the tumor behaves differently.	0.48040875040346154
The question of whether nephrectomy is indicated if there are no malignant features is also open.	0.6540397473525633
The decision depends on the given case.	0.4074604353416045
Nephrectomy can only be avoided if the intraoperative situation allows the tumor to be removed with an adequate distance from healthy tissue.	0.5964488649692853
The safety margin is necessary because mesoblastic nephroma shows fingerlike spread into the surrounding tissue.	0.4233906548151305
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) is a non-invasive method of recording quantitative data from gas exchange and ventilation for the evaluation of oxidative metabolism at rest and during exercise.	0.6211356144647516
Determination of oxygen uptake (VO2) and carbon dioxide output (VCO2) describes the activity of anaerobic vs aerobic metabolism.	0.5304900597028006
An incremental exercise test measuring gas exchange, ventilation and lactate release was performed in healthy volunteers and in patients suffering from mitochondrial disorders.	0.5535139712515599
At rest as well as during exercise patients with mitochondrial disorders differ from healthy subjects with regard to gas exchange and ventilation parameters.	0.5539343198379316
During exercise, the decreased oxygen utilization of skeletal muscle and early activation of anaerobic metabolism in these patients are mirrored by a reduced anaerobic threshold, reduced maximal oxygen uptake and reduced oxygen pulse.	0.6382952827545076
Our study shows that CPX is a sensitive and practical clinical screening method of investigating mitochondrial disorders.	0.4800364348260818
Monitoring of pH of the esophagus is a routine diagnostic procedure, whereas until now pH-monitoring of the hypopharynx has been used only for scientific research.	0.7219555499875991
In the present study a critical evaluation scale was used to record the results of 112 patients who underwent pH monitoring to determine possible reflux.	0.7749721963562036
Since high refluxes often remain unnoticed clinically, further study is required in certain cases.	0.5769232755010929
The extent of reflux in the esophagus may not represent pathological changes in the hypopharynx.	0.522342573636362
In such cases 24-h pH monitoring of the hypopharynx can be a useful diagnostic procedure and may also help detect the pathogenesis of "gastric laryngitis".	0.6938244309589049
The occurrence of plasmodial giant cells in the liver is probably a morphological reaction pattern with the most diverse causes.	0.5774848826389397
In babies and infants, these changes occur in particular in neonatal hepatitis and intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct atresia.	0.53497275959779
Viral infections and/or autoimmune reactions are discussed etiologically in giant cell hepatitis in adults (adult giant cell hepatitis, AGCH), which is much rarer.	0.5984142730168678
In some of the cases, there were conspicuously high titers against paramyxoviruses.	0.8744084580818221
Giant cell hepatitis can occur in the course of HIV infection.	0.5923167487809783
These both indicate an infectious cause.	0.16355819720155051
However, the disease cannot be transmitted to chimpanzees.	0.7104271638357842
Apart from our case, only one further case is described in the literature in which a completed hepatitis A infection could be demonstrated serologically.	0.887351936264117
In addition, the titer of antinuclear antibodies was raised in our patient.	0.5677453048311045
This autoimmune phenomenon is probably of crucial pathogenetic significance in our patient, especially since a hepatitis A infection on its own does not afford an adequate etiological explanation for the form of chronic and active hepatitis with consecutive cirrhotic transformation observed here.	0.58662062699947
In patients with a significant elongation of the ACL we propose a new therapeutic regimen.	0.7714741209826134
After mobilisation of the tibial insertion of the ACL we pull the bone block with the attached ACL distally.	0.5236712524174816
Thus the ACL is easily tightened.	0.30437330116870226
In accordance with this method, we describe the treatment of a case of a strictly proximal rupture of the ACL: the tibial insertion is mobilised, the bone block with the attached ACL removed from the joint.	0.8967848318438628
Ex vivo sutures are placed into the ACL, the ligament is pulled back into the joint, and the shortening of the ligament caused by the sutures is compensated by slight proximal dislocation of the bone block.	0.7245829909773309
Purpose: One aspect of biocompatibility of IOLs can be tested using specular microscopy of the anterior and posterior surface of the lens in vivo.	0.514357047940811
Background: The paper focuses on the issues, how couples cope with SIDS and how this can be facilitated by subsequent children, self-help and professional support.	0.5774880532956785
Methods: In a retrospective study, 60 couples, members of a self-help organization, were studied at the average of 5 years (2-215 months) after their loss.	0.8792117131699374
Depression, anxiety, physical complaints and grief were assessed by standardized questionnaires.	0.5090833233924712
A community sample of equal size of men and women of the same age were used as controls.	0.565134209908625
Results: Average scores of depression and physical complaints were elevated compared to the community sample.	0.5277664931128074
Men and women coped differently with the loss: Bereft mothers were more depressed and ruminated more about cause and preventability of the death than fathers.	0.39885784234203453
They expressed their grief more openly and found it more helpful to speak about their loss.	0.27218807940495854
The presence of subsequent children was of prime importance for coping with the loss; an early subsequent pregnancy was fraught with increased anxiety.	0.5378397436053024
Conclusions: The self-help group serves an important function as a coping resource; the pediatrician plays a key role in the psychosocial care of the afflicted families.	0.6564892092600375
A 63-year-old women developed livedo reticularis during treatment with amantadine.	0.472806019685655
This reversible side effect of amantadine has been most often seen in women and is frequently associated with persistent ankle edema.	0.4661050106726128
We discuss the signs and symptoms, pathogenesis and treatment of amantadine-induced livedo reticularis.	0.6355804732885084
Despite the diagnostic criteria of the ICD-10 and DSM-IV, the term borderline has been used in a non-specific way for a long time.	0.8399733136831176
For our investigation we constructed a questionnaire, which contained the ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for the borderline personality disorder (BPD), plus the criteria for the other personality disorders and for the schizotype disorder.	0.6754964749379183
The two additional criteria for the BPD used by the DSM-IV were added.	0.6559024574720034
800 psychiatrists and psychologists were asked to mark all criteria, which they thought were typical for the BPD.	0.5917867631167228
By using the operational diagnostic approach for ICD-10 and DSM-IV a disorder was diagnosed from each of the 162 received questionnaires based on the marked criteria.	0.6186213818319285
92,0% of the questionnaires contained marked criteria for the diagnosis of the BPD by ICD-10 and 96,3% by DSM-IV.	0.7389050525834256
In addition each questionnaire contained up to eight other diagnosis.	0.30469733166089974
This is a sign for the difficulty to separate the BPD from other personalitiy disorders or the schizotype  disorder by using operationalised criteria.	0.5189897759477956
Looking at the lack of specifity of the operational diagnostic systems for personality  disorders, e.g.	0.4227210766642622
for the BPD which has been discussed by many authors for years, modification of the diagnostic systems should be considered.	0.7306140788802982
Neurobiological research has implicated the dopamine and serotonin system in the pathogenesis of self-injurious behavior.	0.46483295676187836
The efficacy of antipsychotic drugs has been questioned.	0.3617215869991687
Opened and controlled investigations have shown risperidone is effective for reducing self-injurious behaviour in mentally retardation.	0.42069776689449995
We report about 3 mentally retarded patients which were given open-label riperidone for 12 weeks.They participated in a detailed assessment of behaviour symptoms at baseline and the repititive behaviour was weekly rated with the disability assessment schedule (DAS).	0.49694526376197795
Purpose: To test the capabilities of vacuum core biopsy (VCB) in the diagnosis of mammographically indeterminate lesions.	0.664512114415647
Materials and Methods: 120 patients (131 lesions) were examined using VCB with 14G or 11G vacuum core.	0.554950127391002
Radiologic information systems (RIS) and picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) are becoming increasingly widespread.	0.6441560560660028
This leads to new demands on the integration of the individual, formerly independent information systems (RIS, modalities, PACS).	0.584196285001148
Possible ways of integrating individual systems are introduced.	0.2841252329036711
Besides the detailed description of different realizations of system communication, its role in the PACS at the university hospital in Freiburg is explained.	0.6088921397534647
The integration of different information systems still requires the use of proprietary interfaces.	0.4541141462900207
An appropriate integration generally has been realized in Freiburg.	0.28455462935921305
In the near future DICOM basic worklist management will standardize system integration and render an interdepartmental workflow concept possible.	0.2812789637334785
Even though an available communication standard exists, not all problems in the RIS-modality interface are solved.	0.47974115118121013
Different data models in the various RI systems and modalities demand certain degrees of freedom in the standard.	0.36210891477660373
Thus a satisfactory workflow cannot be guaranteed even when all involved systems conform with the standard.	0.41769581469343076
Background: Denecke developed 1957 a surgical strategy consisting of three or four operative steps for rehabilitation of patients with unilateral paralysis of IXth and Xth cranial nerve.	0.48467659353578096
These four steps are the following: myotomy of the cricopharyngeal muscle, resection of the paralyzed pharyngeal wall, medialization of the paralyzed vocal cord and fixation of the soft palate to the posterior pharyngeal wall which can be facultative.	0.5945828848369323
Reconstruction of the navel after tumour excision with subsequent navel resection is of great aesthetic importance for the patient.	0.5754294089149155
Methods of navel reconstruction are found in the literature but do not provide an elegant solution to the problem.	0.6885041641931753
Our method permits reconstruction of the navel during wound closure, by creation of two opposing trapezoidal skin flaps at the excision margin in the midline of the body; the umbilical fossa is then restored by jointly anchoring these flaps to the linea alba.	0.5389437415550064
Reconstruction has been successfully carried out in this way after melanoma excision in 7 patients.	0.6308786351087673
Mammography is an established diagnostic procedure for breast cancer.	0.5122158092967943
Data concerning screening mammography are available from nine prospectively controlled trials, the largest series being presented from Sweden.	0.5317047733868856
Mammographic screening leads to a significant reduction of breast cancer of 30 % in women ages 50-59 years.	0.790462195162106
In younger women (40-49 years) the benefit accounts to only 20 % and has not proven to be statistically significant.	0.8760818881515039
Nevertheless, the major advantage of mammographic screening is detection of the non-palpable tumor <= 10 mm in size.	0.7111847935165371
The treatment of these small breast carcinomas leads to long-term survival rates of >= 90 %.	0.8368325946656164
Mammographic screening programs have been introduced in the USA, Canada, Iceland and Sweden for women in their 5th decade of life.	0.4217842540634116
Starting yearly lifelong mammography-screening at the age of 40, the theoretical cancer induction by radiation exposure does not exceed 0.1 %.	0.5388600739379851
Under highly qualified conditions, it should be possible to minimize false-positive and false-negative screening results.	0.671837413176549
In Germany, screening-mammography is only introduced in patients at high risk for breast cancer.	0.5711840512348624
Based on medical data, mammography must be a part of screening for women with an average risk - starting at the age of 40, although there are still open questions needing further clinical research.	0.6881637130769103
Upper lid closure in facial nerve paresis induced lagophthalmos is often improved by implantation of gold weights.	0.3367414165380433
However, the tolerability of gold implants has not always met expectations.	0.5012105027735705
We therefore investigated whether results could be improved by implantation of well-tolerated platinum implants.	0.5452417353364184
Methods to determine the mechanical properties of surgical wounds and sutures are valuable tools in wound healing research.	0.5073906024163508
So far standardized testing procedures have not been defined in the surgical literature, which reduces the comparability of results from different authors.	0.6877191538271643
Therefore we suggest a modified tensile testing procedure which follows German industrial standards (DIN 53 455).	0.35331937069623465
The experimental set-up includes an universal testing machine and special clamps.	0.3347729473280637
The dumbbell-shaped specimen consist of freshly prepared pig skin and the suture which is to be tested.	0.46859948415200375
Well-known mechanical properties of surgical sutures and wounds were used to approve the precision of the experimental set-up.	0.6218507734162779
Reproducible analysis of all tested sutures and wounds (n = 120) was possible.	0.6026360491209883

Abstract  An infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) leads to a large variety of complications affecting almost every organ system.	0.5125238922354929
With the increasing numbers of HIV infections, some authors have reported an occasional association between an infection with HIV and arterial aneurysm.	0.6435508819846997
However, complications affecting the vascular system demanding surgical intervention are rare.	0.591441730837307
Partial nasal obstruction in preterm and term infants increases airway resistance.	0.2959208644652967
It may reduce ventilation and cause disturbances of respiratory regulation.	0.3829467125277123
Although this is well established, nasogastric tubes are commonly used, because orogastric tubes are difficult to secure.	0.6112084966165346
A new technique for fixing orogastric tubes was tested in a prospective study in 11 preterm and term infants over a 4 weeks period.	0.6446583407780396
There was no preterm dislocation of an oral tube in 7 patients.	0.5801989898828563
The orogastric tube had to be reinserted once before regular change in 3 patients and only 1 patiend aged 15 weeks presented with multiple dislocations of the tube.	0.5504179446203764
On the basis of a 3 days period for regular change of the orogastric tube the reliability of this new technique was 86,2% for all patients and 92,5% for patients below 8 weeks of age.	0.8112532428358186
Mesenchymal neoplasms of lipogenic differentiation are the most common soft-tissue neoplasms in adults.	0.5339722346863199
In recent years a number of "new" entities and variants have been described.	0.5789351701308931
Their recognition is important to avoid diagnostic pitfalls and inappropriate therapy.	0.43542114824146516
Chondroid lipoma, myolipoma, and purely cutaneous spindle-cell/pleomorphic lipoma are biologically benign neoplasms which may mimic sarcomas morphologically.	0.44637108947021853
Despite high-grade morphology cutaneous liposarcomas carry a favorable clinical prognosis.	0.4323532380403176
Spindle cell liposarcoma is a rare variant of atypical lipomatous tumour (well-differentiated liposarcoma) and must be distinguished from dedifferentiated liposarcoma with metastatic potential and benign spindle cell lipoma.	0.5844171108218758
The advent of cytogenetic and molecular investigations of lipomatous neoplasms has contributed to a better understanding of the biology of these neoplasms and led to a modification of conventional classification schemes.	0.4701097669947927
The intracranial space is divided into two large compartments by the tentorium.	0.4928629087440116
The hydrostatic pressure of spinal fluid is responsible for buoyancy of the brain within these compartments.	0.5135645582005822
In patients with craniectomy this equilibrium is exposed to atmospheric pressure.	0.4008162750293378
We report on four cases of reversible herniation after either bilateral or unilateral decompressive craniectomy performed for increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and failure of conservative ICP treatment.	0.5432860046277624
All four patients had survived a severe neurological disease (encephalitis, subdural haematoma, stroke) which required craniectomy to control raised ICP.	0.569264391405802
All were successfully weaned from the ventilator and awake and CT scans showed no space-occupying lesion anymore.	0.46987810734168994
The patients showed a typical "sunken pattern" at the trepanation site.	0.6688989681782441
All patients developed clinical signs of transtentorial herniation (i.e.	0.38666876972929326
unilateral dilated pupils, deteriorated alertness, and extensor posturing) shortly after either diagnostic or presumed therapeutic lumbar puncture.	0.41891364285165517
One patient developed herniation a second time while in the typical 30 ° upright position.	0.5159407761249346
After craniectomy, transtentorial herniation is possible even in the absence of increased ICP.	0.4228658866874295
It is related to a negative gradient between atmospheric and intracranial pressure, which is enhanced by changes in the CSF compartment following lumbar puncture.	0.6687339868473984
Lumbar puncture should be avoided if possible and, when necessary, only be performed in the head-down position.	1.0025646525678342
Acute therapy in these cases is quite simple; it requires flat or even head-down positioning and early cranioplasty.	0.5747450399212782
Diseases of the oral cavity, floor of the mouth, and nervous system can be accompanied by disturbances in tongue movement during swallowing.	0.5083406345538394
These disturbances can be diagnosed by videosonography whereby the examiner has to evaluate extensive video documentation of lingual motion.	0.4699936783380719
It was the aim of this study to facilitate this evaluation by the application of a reproducible computer-assisted quantitative analysis procedure.	0.706046413500829
Video sequences of 56 healthy adults and 19 patients with dysphagias of different etiologies were analysed.	0.5078734406836222
A numerical estimation of swallowing movements was carried out in abstraction from the structures imaged (bolus, air, muscles of the tongue, floor of the mouth, hyoid, etc.).	0.4785544675480644
Intensity changes of the pixels within previously defined radial image sectors were quantified in relationship to time and depicted as sector curves.	0.36743805162857257
The healthy adults demonstrated a characteristic pattern of two motion maxima that appeared within almost all sector curves.	0.3752372638489283
These maxima represented bolus transport movements and the reset movement of the tongue.	0.4052847087915977
Patients with diseases of the tongue or neuromuscular changes caused by disturbances of the central nervous system showed pathological deviations on videosonography.	0.5310517267170685
These appeared as local or general reductions in movement, slow speed motions, repetitive swallowing or unsorted additional movements of the tongue during swallowing.	0.4617823213110263
Clinically-used ketamine is a racemic mixture of two isomers, S-(+)- and R-(-)-ketamine.	0.7852383385870056
Previous investigations showed the anaesthetic potency of S-(+)-ketamine to be three times higher than that of R-(-)-ketamine.	0.7748504449437275
It was the aim of this study to compare the effects of S-(+)-ketamine and racemic ketamine on endocrine and cardiovascular parameters, recovery, and side effects in geriatric patients during total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) for orthopaedic surgery.	0.7216684530221927
Forty patients over 60 years of age scheduled for elective hip or knee replacement were investigated in a double-blind, randomised design.	0.5888775232093564
For induction of TIVA, patients received 0.1 mg midazolam, 0.5 mg atropine, 1 mg/kg S(+)-ketamine or 2 mg/kg racemic ketamine, respectively, 2 mg vecuronium, and 1.5 mg/kg suxamethonium.	0.9100858164028955
After intubation and relaxation with a total dose of 0.1 mg/kg vecuronium, a continuous infusion of 2 mg/kg per hour S-(+)- or 4 mg/kg per hour racemic ketamine was administered throughout surgery.	0.7518083877988148
Blood samples were taken through a central venous catheter at seven time-points, before induction as well during and after surgery, until the 1st postoperative morning for analysis of adrenaline, noradrenaline (by high-pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection), anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol (by radioimmunoassay), glucose, and lactate.	0.5817898124667598
In addition, systolic arterial pressure (SAP), heart rate (HR), and arterial oxygen saturation were measured, and the time intervals between the end of ketamine infusion and the return of consciousness and orientation were protocolled.	0.6795330542271765
The incidence and assessment of dreams and other side effects were reported by the patients.	0.7113949726366531
Biometric data of the groups were comparable, the mean age of both groups being 68 years.	0.8338519198159172
Plasma adrenaline, noradrenaline, ADH, ACTH, cortisol, and glucose as well as SAP and HR increased significantly (P<0.05) during the course of anaesthesia.	0.5543060060267018
The influence on lactate levels was not significant.	0.47153970686046076
There were no differences between S-(+)- and racemic ketamine with respect to these parameters.	0.7122920589305661
Three patients in the ketamine-racemate group showed severe arterial hypertension and were withdrawn from the study.	0.5616785850144309
Recovery clearly improved after administration of S-(+)-ketamine compared to the racemate.	0.6334267984304434
Simple orders were followed after 2.0 +/- 3.4 versus 4.9 +/- 6.8 min (P=0.07), orientation with respect to person returned after 5.7 +/- 4.0 versus 14.6 +/- 10.0 min (P<0.001) and spatial orientation after 8.2 +/- 5.4 versus 17.4 +/- 9.7 min (P<0.001).	0.7556283656233052
After racemic ketamine, 1 patient remembered a negative dream and 1 patient a positive dream.	0.6413241688099407
In the S-(+)-group, 1 positive dream was reported.	0.6029508399187323
No intraoperative awareness was reported, and all patients would accept the same anaesthesia again.	0.5640051184476718
Increases in cardiovascular parameters and insufficient reduction of the stress response with respect to ADH, ACTH, and cortisol seem to require a more potent hypnotic element during TIVA with ketamine.	0.5185824977628781
With regard to endocrine and cardiovascular parameters, the pharmacodynamic effects of racemic and S-(+)-ketamine were comparable.	0.6001523979070249
Because of the significant improvement in recovery and the reduced quantitative drug load, S-(+)-ketamine offers a clinical advantage compared with currently used racemic ketamine.	0.5967210547092735
The closure of large circular defects on the scalp is technically difficult and cosmetically often not satisfying, if a free transplant is necessary.	0.5340128490854851
Following the technique of Tillmann described first in 1908, several flaps shaped like a windmill can be combined.	0.4833007020837294
We report on 14 patients (ages 41-88 years) where large defects resulting from the excision of various tumors (5 melanomas, 5 basal cell carcinomas, 1 keratoacanthoma, 1 trichilemmal cyst, 1 squamous cell carcinoma, 1 skin metastasis) were successfully closed by this method.	0.7846664213016205
The diameter of the defect ranged between 4 and 8 cm (mean 5,7 cm).	0.7346089070954552
Size and number of the rotating flaps (3 or 4) was varied according to the size of the defect and the mobility of the surrounding tissue.	0.8089318058582444
The procedure was performed with local anesthesia in all cases.	0.895120484060505
Wound healing occurred without complications except in 3 cases.	0.4579087945581315
2 patients (63 years, 70 years) developed small necrotic areas on the tips of the flaps.	0.5834963662293758
In a 74 year old man with a very large defect of 8 cm diameter, one flap of four underwent total necrosis.	0.6034832725131141
The cosmetic result was rated "very good" in 71,4% and "good" in 14,3%.	0.7475742086155593
The preservation of the terminal hair turned out to be of special advantage.	0.6447788696995447
The "windmill procedure" is an important addition to the surgical approaches for closure of large defects on the scalp, particularly in young patients.	0.8376577965215259
Intimal sarcoma of the pulmonary artery is an extremely rare type of malignant tumor of the large vessels.	0.7263000271774528
Despite systematic diagnostics, distinguishing between pulmonary emboli and tumors is difficult.	0.3547173442210041
We report a patient who was referred because of suspected embolic occlusion of the pulmonary artery.	0.8142139855087067
The operation was started with the intention of performing a pulmonary artery thromboendarterectomy; however, intraoperative histology revealed a malignant mesenchymal tumor.	0.5477487155566206
Therefore, the left lung was resected with the use of extracorporeal circulation, and the pulmonary trunk and right pulmonary artery were reconstructed.	0.8413703271498946
A solitary right lung metastasis was resected 3 months later using stapling devices.	0.3560312565528286
Complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice for patients with sarcoma of the pulmonary arteries.	0.746931574612465
Surgical therapy often includes extensive reconstructive measures.	0.223655726569742
Since, thromboembolic obstruction cannot be excluded preoperatively, patients with this type of disease should be treated at centers experienced with the broad spectrum of pulmonary artery surgery.	0.682546560550563
Abstract  A rare cause of painful swelling of the knee cavity can be an aneurysm of the popliteal vein.	0.7567943496892887
Only 28 cases are reported in the literature.	0.4808657570097829
We treated a 20-year-old male patient who underwent three arthroscopies, one operation and one MRI; finally, phlebography detected a popliteal vein aneurysm and a malformation of the deep venous system of the popliteal and proximal calf veins.	0.6555974606584357
To avoid the threat of pulmonary embolism a resection of the aneurysm with interposition of a venous autograft was performed.	0.6655546750390695
Twelve months after the operation the patient is free of symptoms with a patent autograft.	0.9543480269121501
Hearing aids have fundamental disadvantages: (1) stigmatization of the patient; (2) the sound is often found to be unsatisfactory due to the limited frequency range and undesired distortion; (3) in many patients, the ear canal fitting device generally necessary leads to an occlusion effect; (4) acoustic feedback when amplification is high.	0.7335986051291026
Conventional hearing aids transmit sound into the ear canal via a small microphone.	0.43586353343007744
Sound has the disadvantage of requiring high output sound pressure levels for its transmission.	0.3651328806897968
This along with the necessary miniaturization of the loudspeaker as well as the resonances and reflections in the closed ear canal contribute to the disadvantages mentioned.	0.503188445661421
In contrast, implantable hearing aids do not make sound signals but micromechanical vibrations.	0.4040350263147644
An implantable hearing aid has an electromechanical transducer instead of the loudspeaker of a conventional hearing aid.	0.4944168041199836
The hearing signal does not leave the transducer as sound but as a mechanical vibration which is directly coupled to the auditory system bypassing the air.	0.3935846515794825
This implantable hearing aid is either coupled to the tympanic membrane, the ossicular chain, the perilymph of the inner ear, or the skull.	0.7715974004514983
Corneal cells are known to participate in the regulation of local inflammatory processes by secretion of cytokines.	0.4907137459767293
As the corneal endothelium may be exposed to endotoxin in organ culture and endotoxin is known to trigger inflammatory reactions, we investigated the effect of endotoxin from E. coli on organ cultured donor corneae with respect to autocrine and paracrine functions and the endothelial viability and density.	0.5301834956118913
For the majority of patients with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) many available hearing aids often do not achieve satisfactory results.	0.4767360324932951
For these patients partially implantable hearing devices have been developed, allowing distortion-free hearing and speech intelligibility that may be superior to conventional hearing aids.	0.6348691875682116
The external parts of partial implants, however, may result in a patient's stigmatization.	0.7597707451588555
Furthermore, they do not use the acoustic properties of the external auditory canal.	0.7213767663157524
Recently, we published the successful development of the first totally implantable hearing device for the treatment of SNHL (HNO 46 [1998] 853-863).	0.5969563048934525
Here we report the first implantations of this unique, totally implantable electronic hearing system in patients with SNHL: Implex TICA LZ 3001.	0.5596351652551997
The implant microphone is implanted subcutaneously in the outer ear canal near the ear drum.	0.3806998403614623
The signal is processed by a digitally programmable multichannel audioprocessor located subcutaneously on the bony skull behind the ear.	0.29585202951233824
A piezoelectric transducer is coupled to the body of the incus and drives the ossicular chain by vibratory actions.	0.4460031638439429

Implanted patients describe hearing as being distortion-free and transparent.	0.44075947398323584
Speech intelligibility and the hearing of music are improved.	0.30011809412176405
Patients may achieve better speech discrimination, especially in the presence of background noise.	0.5398433731420028
The aid can be used during sports, including swimming.	0.7865722392832183
To our knowledge, this is the first report of the implantation of a totally implantable electronic hearing system in patients.	0.6434924801768193
