Mr President, Mrs Karamanou' s question is an extremely serious one, and I would not wish to conceal that fact.	1.5392485386499193
We are perfectly aware of the difficult and dramatic humanitarian situation in Kosovo and of the problem of displaced people in that region - and I mean people who originate from Kosovo - and of the particular effect of this on child health and on mortality rates.	1.402229549415855
I think it is well known that the European Union has made a clear contribution to the humanitarian aid effort being made by the international community.	1.3000074478707067
As you know, the European Community has contributed a total of EUR 378 million for the province of Kosovo alone, and this has to be seen in conjunction with the contributions made by Member States at national level.	1.4145190416519844
This contribution covers various projects in the fields of health and health systems and of water purification.	0.9827507892919569
Furthermore, as you know, the European Union makes a contribution to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, which came to EUR 66.3 million in 1999.	1.3474104613550733
I think that Mrs Karamanou is aware that, because of the need for division of labour between the international donors, the task of restoring health care in Kosovo has been entrusted to the World Health Organisation.	1.2634542070339643
The reports produced by the WHO indicate that it is fully aware of the alarming infant mortality situation, and it has focused its efforts on improving basic conditions in maternity and general hospitals.	1.1177623633054736
Nevertheless, we are aware that this situation is far from a satisfactory solution and that there are widespread repercussions in other areas of health care, apart from child health.	1.294909567734366
This is not just a technical situation, it is a political situation, and it goes hand in hand with the need to solve the political situation, because there are aspects to this, and we may as well be open about this, which are associated with the international community' s inability up to now to make a multi-ethnic society function in Kosovo, with tragic effects on attempts to improve health care in that region.	1.532100880735895
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I thank you for your answer which supplements what Commissioner Patten said yesterday on the subject.	1.0372262069337361
Yet, the sum of EUR 378 million you mentioned had been given in 1999, was proved by the facts to be quite insufficient to create even rudimentary civilised conditions in Kosovo, especially where the provision of health services is concerned.	1.2534027165679917
Mr President-in-Office, do you not think that the very fact of increased child mortality is an abomination for the continent of Europe, a shameful thing, which should motivate us all, so that the aid we provide becomes more effective and more generous?	1.2764763226533882
Of course, the situation was not idyllic, even before the bombardments, anything but, I should say. However, since NATO' s intervention, there has been a very clear deterioration in the natural and human environment.	1.5299056921343799
So, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is it not a moral obligation that we should try to create civilised conditions for the long-suffering inhabitants of Kosovo, and above all, keep our promises to them?	1.2403764210417338
Mrs Karamanou, I recognise the fact that all the efforts that have been made in Kosovo in this field have not been enough.	1.6947738762221662
I do not think that any of us has the least doubt about that.	1.0763514057941468
I do not want to link this question with your comments about the period "before" and "after" NATO' s intervention, as we will probably touch on that issue at another point during this Question Time.	1.2096093146635718
Nevertheless, I would like to say that the European Union is aware that the resources it has devoted to Kosovo reflect the financial limitations it has to work within.	1.3722822426715624
We have to remember that we share responsibility in that region with the international community.	1.1645953498054784
The European Union has a certain responsibility in view of that particular role, but we cannot undertake to rapidly rebuild structures that were, as you have said yourself, Mrs Karamanou, not the best before the military action in Kosovo.	1.4854022704800816
What is more, I do not believe, Mrs Karamanou, that the military action in Kosovo resulted in such a significant destruction of public health facilities as to have had a direct impact on the current situation.	1.3976282440091443
The present position is more dramatic in terms of displaced populations, and in terms of a whole raft of economic factors and of the level of satisfaction with basic health facilities resulting from the overall breakdown in organisational structures in Kosovo' s administration.	1.0907866407033027
This is the basic issue underlying the present situation as a whole.	1.3540865152171586
And if we cannot solve the political problem, which must be done in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolution, then we will not solve the problem of child health, nor the various other problems faced by this region.	1.384370943855785
I would like to widen the debate and include the situation in Mitrovica.	1.4104116706573975
In cooperation with Europe, the international community rebuilt the hospital there too, but it is located in the northern part of the city, thus prohibiting access to Albanian Kosovars.	1.2498718440684806
This means that medical aid is still denied to the Albanian Kosovars.	1.0105452644338142
This is also happening elsewhere in the country, causing tension between the Albanian Kosovars and Serbs, making for a situation where nobody trusts anybody anymore and where Albanians do not want to be looked after by Serbs and vice versa.	1.20142953089017
I understand very well what you are saying and you are right: the European Union should work in a wider context of international cooperation.	1.3778845053955953
But where will you place the emphasis?	0.7035785785341916
What will you do to ensure that Albanian Kosovars too can be cared for in a hospital, including that in Mitrovica?	1.1221302215518028
Mr Staes, the situation in Mitrovica is well known.	1.349666770005516
This is a very special situation with a degree of inter-ethnic tension which fortunately is not matched with such severity in others parts of Kosovo.	1.0085973599688205
I perfectly understand Mr Staes' s concerns.	0.6036076356285742
Nevertheless, I would like to say that Bernard Kouchner' s work in this area has aimed to comply with the objectives of the relevant United Nations resolution, in an attempt to create multi-ethnic facilities which can serve the various communities, including the various aspects of the administration.	1.2901180695237395
I believe that we should not jump to conclusions here about who is responsible, because there are various protagonists involved.	1.2510530805907096
The situation in Mitrovica is appalling, and involves very special tensions, and I believe that the measures taken over the last few hours to create safe conditions in that area are to be welcomed.	1.4083335777178758
Nevertheless, I have to say that, regrettably, we do not have the police resources - and this is connected with the Member States' contributions - to guarantee the follow-up action we proposed to the military action, that is to say the establishment of inter-ethnic coordination mechanisms guaranteeing adequate safety for the various communities, and, in particular, access to hospitals.	1.3913762748703267
Question No 3 by (H-0027/00):	0.7626163926206575
Subject: Indictment of NATO before War Crimes Tribunal Human rights organisations, such as the US Human Rights Watch, have already collected significant evidence of NATO crimes in connection with the bombing of Kosovo and Serbia with a view to bringing a case before the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague.	1.1950069295989092
On the basis of this evidence, some of which has already been lodged with the Tribunal, NATO is accused of 'serious violations of international humanitarian law' and 'wilful murder'.	1.1374212697776063
Does the Council consider that such accusations should be put before the War Crimes Tribunal for a thorough judicial investigation?	1.0059223162201858
In the event of a judicial inquiry into the accusations against NATO, what will be done in respect of the High Representative for the CFSP, who was NATO Secretary-General during the crisis?	1.3643130259992307
Is there any procedure for suspending him from office until the judicial investigation into the accusations has been completed?	0.9909275295264607
Mr President, Mr Alavanos' question naturally gives us food for thought on a wide range of issues.	1.1646828624216428
The Council has already, on various occasions, stated its conviction that the severe measures taken by NATO were both necessary and justified to deal with extremist and irresponsible actions involving clear violations of the United Nations Security Council resolutions.	1.1382888544418512
I am aware that there may be different views about NATO' s action and the legitimacy of that action.	1.1068091411919352
Everyone is free to hold such views.	0.6769597493355195
In my own country, the various parliamentary groups had differing views on this matter.	1.0132551979375786
That was how it was.	0.5850271672263284
In any case, the Council' s position is clear in that it considers that the objective of the air campaign carried out by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was to put an end to the humanitarian disaster in Kosovo caused by the Belgrade regime.	1.2155449311497648
This objective was fully and formally expressed in the statement adopted by the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 8 April.	1.0715360407857362
I must say that these NATO measures were not taken lightly and were only carried out as a last resort when it became evident that all avenues for reaching a negotiated solution had been exhausted and that the Belgrade authorities were concentrating their forces in order to expel the Kosovo Albanians from their land.	1.0033116048996096
I am sure you are aware, Mr Alavanos, that, during her recent visit to NATO headquarters, Prosecutor Del Ponte stressed that the International Tribunal was obliged to examine all accusations presented to it, including those made against NATO, in particular by pacifist groups from Canada.	1.26602720407562
This compulsory examination was to be carried out in line with accusations submitted.	0.9475685990570227
In any case, I have with me a statement made by Prosecutor Del Ponte according to which NATO is not at present under any investigation by the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and there is no formal inquiry process concerning NATO' s actions in the Kosovo conflict.	1.3496558142400457
All information received during the past six months, either from individuals or from groups requesting an investigation of NATO' s actions during the Kosovo conflict, have been recorded by the Prosecutor.	1.1475570997616222
Any other information will of course be analysed by the Prosecutor, who will in due course decide whether or not there is cause for action.	1.1645529843779998
Until that time Prosecutor Del Ponte has decided not to examine any of the accusations of criminality made against NATO.	0.8770134450137967
I thank the President-in-Office but I do not agree with him that the purpose of NATO' s intervention was to stop a humanitarian disaster, because we have a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo today, we have the hell of Milosevic, followed by the hell of the KLA and the NATO forces.	1.312324162195724
If the President-in-Office has noticed, almost half the questions he has had to answer today relate to Kosovo.	1.1504037942042142
Despite this, he too accepted that the inquisition procedure of the War Crimes Tribunal against NATO after applications by Canadian and other pacifist organisations is an open question.	1.0441975280945128
My question, which the President-in-Office did not answer, is this: if this inquisition procedure begins, in which the main or, if you will, one of the main people interrogated and probably found guilty will be Mr Solana, who is today the High Representative of the European Union' s Common Foreign and Security Policy, should it not be, if that happens, if the General Prosecutor of the Tribunal is determined to begin the process, that Mr Solana' s status is suspended at least until it is shown that his hands are clean?	1.4453106226143537
Mr Alavanos, if an action of this kind should be brought against NATO and if this action were to be brought against Mr Javier Solana personally, we would have to bear in mind that Mr Javier Solana held one post at that time and is holding a different one today.	1.4211402314512918
The duties that he exercises today have nothing whatsoever to do with the duties that he exercised during his time as Secretary-General of NATO.	0.9537551129875352
In the absence of any corresponding indication from any international judicial body which could justify any personal accusation against Mr Javier Solana - and there is no sign of this whatsoever - the European Union will not of course make any statement at all on this matter.	1.209636287891075
Mr President, I believe Mr Alavanos is getting NATO and Mr Milosevic mixed up.	1.240637075607507
Mr Milosevic should be appearing before the war crimes tribunal and we should be awarding NATO the Sakharov prize.	0.955037851072501
But I have a quite different question for the Council.	1.4546713571513694
How do matters stand in Kosovo with regard to the rebuilding of the administration, the judiciary and, most importantly of all, the police force?	1.4243863948184672
You mentioned before that we are on the brink of catastrophe there and nothing is being done.	1.0245888451801557
Rapid action is called for!	0.6525785343082618
First of all, I would like to say that I agree with the priorities you have identified concerning personal responsibility, Mr Posselt.	1.2159964528713014
With regard to the judicial structure in Kosovo, we have already heard Mr Kouchner, on various occasions, describe the enormous difficulties he is experiencing in setting up administrative machinery and a judicial structure.	1.2752715587308283
As you know, the first steps were taken some months ago.	1.283916656617319
We are all aware of the difficulties, and particularly the financial difficulties, that Mr Kouchner is facing in setting up this administrative machinery, and, in particular, we are aware of the special difficulty involved in recruiting police so as to ensure day-to-day public safety.	1.3670703926336978
This is a responsibility that the European Union takes very seriously, Mr Posselt, and I would like to mention that, at the General Affairs Council held on Monday, this issue was repeatedly stressed when we were discussing Kosovo.	1.5836120623445742
Statements were made and pressure was brought to bear on the various Member States who have undertaken to make police resources available to honour their commitments.	1.0938869399226283
Some Member States are taking refuge in the fact that they have provided military forces and that they cannot send the police forces, to which they committed themselves, as quickly as they would like.	1.488091498472096
We are certainly very much aware that this factor is seriously compromising Mr Kouchner' s work and the normalisation of administrative structures in Kosovo, especially as regards judicial structures and police cover.	1.176445938587177
This is having unfortunate and obvious effects on the scope for controlling inter-ethnic coordination, and we are all conscious that, if measures are not taken in the short term, we may end up with situations involving the kind of tensions that we witnessed just a few hours ago, and that these tensions may be mirrored in other areas of Kosovo.	1.4575630074368906
This is obviously a question which really has to be seen in a NATO context, but, as the European Union shares NATO' s view of these issues, it is not difficult for us to associate ourselves with this. I would like to make this clear on behalf of the Council, so that there can be no doubt.	1.528409988137986
Mr Marset Campos, you will be aware, first of all, of how difficult it is to select targets during a military operation, particularly an air-based one, and you will also be aware that there is a category of targets that, whilst they are not military targets as such, are infrastructure targets selected with a view to hindering the smooth running of the military machine.	1.410592533579264
We are of course entering a grey area here, and you may say, Mr Marset Campos, that these are civilian targets, such as bridges and road and rail infrastructure, whilst others will tell me that they are military targets, because they are targets which support military structures in aggressive campaigns such as those carried out by Mr Milosevic' s forces in Kosovo.	1.345548744456801
So we do not see eye to eye on how we view certain targets.	1.061760040355093
Unfortunately, and as everyone recognised during the military action in Kosovo, there were civilian sectors, and in particular infrastructural sectors directly affecting the general public, and even inhabited areas, which were directly affected by NATO air attacks.	1.5613502395295986
This is generally recognised and this happens in all wars, and the Kosovo war was not a clean war, nor a model war, but a war based on the art of the possible.	1.4358846759694992
And, above all, it was a necessary war, and it was not only about what was possible, it was necessary to put an end to an absolutely unacceptable form of aggression which was utterly rejected by the entire international community.	1.4546938569720649
Mr Marset Campos, regardless of how we may see things with hindsight - and it is easy to see things with the benefit of hindsight, if you take no action yourself - I believe that, if we look at what happened in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and at the impunity that the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina led to, and the continuation of that impunity, then we might perhaps see the NATO military action in Kosovo in a somewhat less catastrophic light.	1.4071213472754294
Question No 4 by (H-0028/00):	0.7753425151220945
Subject: Turkish blockade of Armenia Given that the European Union is actively promoting social, economic and political relations with Armenia through the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, signed on 12 October 1999, what steps is the Council taking to persuade the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia?	0.9057724330010885
Has the time come for the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia?	0.5841436848913565
Mr President, I would like to thank the Representative of the Council Presidency for his answer.	1.3210820617567276
Nevertheless, I am a little disappointed that this is viewed from a bilateral angle first and foremost when, ultimately, there is in fact a major tripartite relationship.	1.4323957467545865
We provide partnership funding and there are cooperation agreements in place, in order to help Armenia, and still the aid cannot come into play because Turkey has imposed an economic blockade, and so many things cannot get through to the Armenians at all.	1.3109819129285682
We are negotiating with Turkey as to the possibility of its acceding to the Union and so it is in the interests of all of us that every state that wishes to become a Member should cultivate friendly relations with its neighbours.	1.2780496616807795
Can you not exert greater influence over Turkey, so as to enable there to be peaceful developments in this region, and so as to enable Armenians themselves to develop in the way they need to for there to be progress on the cooperation front?	1.3464837040183861
- (PT) Mrs Schleicher, you are quite right to say that we should use our relationship with Turkey to ensure that that country can play a constructive role in this situation and, particularly, that it becomes part of the solution rather than part of the problem.	1.4284956252661973
We feel that precisely because Turkey has embarked on a new type of relationship with the European Union, and also because Turkey now has to respond to the European Union' s positions on common foreign and security policy issues, we will, to be frank, be testing Turkey' s will as regards the European Union' s priorities in its foreign relations.	1.4655995213611872
Our relationship with Armenia, as evinced by the agreement we signed with that country last year, is of course one element in these foreign relations.	1.2956282099541268
We also feel that, if Turkey wishes to move towards sharing the fundamental values of the European Union and the general framework of the European Union' s relations, regardless of whatever special bilateral conditions may apply to its own relations with any other country, it must in general act in accordance with the basic standards demonstrated by the European Union in its foreign relations.	1.4602489148924684
We are, moreover, convinced that this issue will be one of the priorities of the bilateral relations between the European Union and Turkey in the near future.	1.2042240566483315
Question No 6 by (H-0122/00):	0.6870635923179379
Subject: Ethnic cleansing of Serbs in Kosovo Since the end of the bombing of Yugoslavia by NATO and the EU aimed at preventing the ethnic cleansing of Kosovar Albanians by Serbia, and since the arrival of KFOR on 12 June 1999, 200 000 Serbs living in Kosovo have been expelled and 768 murdered, constituting ethnic cleansing on a larger scale than that carried out by the Serbs themselves.	1.137260683705431
During the last few days we have seen Serbs murdered by Kosovar Albanian Mafia-type groups, also with impunity.	1.2020908149210217
What decision will the Council adopt to put an end, once and for all, to this ethnic cleansing and to guarantee respect for the human rights of the whole population of Kosovo, irrespective of race or creed?	1.394830056348309
I thank the Minister for his response, but I would also like to point out that, statistically, there is now more violence in Kosovo than there was before the NATO bombing.	1.3599266498936131
It is worrying that the bombing has aggravated the situation, and we should recognise that it was a mistake on the part of NATO and the European Union to take such action.	1.388681545953074
I agree with what the Minister very rightly said about the culpability of Belgrade, but we should also remember that the secret services of the USA, Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom have been supplying arms and money to the KLA, a mafia, which has contributed to the problems in the area.	1.4176252697514855
We are therefore all to blame.	1.155160990470217
I would like to ask him a supplementary question in a wider context.	1.1797346296879605
Do you not think that it would be beneficial to lift the embargo on Serbia in order to normalise the area economically and also to benefit Kosovo as a province of Serbia?	1.1308488449152665
Mr President, I am no friend of Milosevic or his government.	1.148039204034837
Nevertheless I have the gravest doubts about the legitimacy of Nato's action against Yugoslavia over Kosovo, both in terms of the lack of authority from the UN Security Council and because it could have been avoided by not imposing unacceptable terms on Serbia's sovereignty at Rambouillet.	1.1673994400151522
The current situation in Kosovo, which is now ethnically cleansed of Serbs and Roma, speaks for itself.	1.20460794361395
Should Nato not at the very least acknowledge fault for its deliberate targeting of the Belgrade TV tower and killing over 20 civilian journalists, which remains a severe moral blemish on the conduct of the war and now opens the embarrassment of a possible indictment for war crimes against our Western leaders?	1.106179382524293
Mr Tannock, with regard to the position adopted by the European Union, we do not have selective interpretations and analyses of what were military objectives, and in particular of the initiatives taken against certain types of infrastructure that were propping up Mr Milosevic' s political system and acting as propaganda for him.	1.2227681160194963
I cannot therefore tell you whether we agreed or not on a specific action carried out by NATO, but it was part of an overall plan with which we do agree.	1.3574626911255516
Some of these actions might have been questionable, and some were regarded as unfortunate by NATO itself, but others were justified for tactical reasons, with the aim of preventing Mr Milosevic from continuing his propaganda campaign within the former Yugoslavia.	1.258823771060356
In any event, I, on behalf of the Council, do not wish to make a value judgement about any specific military action carried out by NATO.	1.211226182784248
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, since I know the history of the Balkans, I should like to remind you that, for many decades, the peoples of Yugoslavia lived in peace.	1.2595695404167158
Destabilisation began around ten years ago with the break-up of Yugoslavia, in which the European Union played a decisive part.	1.1975842064943523
Yugoslavia' s crime was that it was the only Balkan country that did not ask to become a member either of NATO or of the European Union.	1.232017095931657
So whatever remained standing after the air attacks is now being destroyed by the supposedly disarmed KLA, under the very nose of KFOR, whose role as an occupying force is becoming increasingly apparent.	1.0991994429748517
Every day, new crimes come to light against non-Albanian speakers and against the cultural heritage of Kosovo, and there are hundreds of violations of the UN' s Resolution 1244.	1.2622804709034665
In my opinion, the best thing the Council could do would be to cease occupying that part of Yugoslavia and search for a solution acceptable to all sides, with respect for the various national characteristics in the area and especially respect for the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of another, independent country.	1.3402759868745224
I respect your understanding and knowledge of the Balkan region, Mr Alyssandrakis, but I find it difficult, quite frankly, to understand how respecting the characteristics of the region can, in terms of political stability, be a solution to the problem.	1.5209649328048314
If we look at the democratic stability of the region, it could perhaps be said that it was the break-up of Yugoslavia that caused the current situation, but let us not get involved in interpreting an international development.	1.3671042041826829
Nevertheless, I would like to say that Yugoslavia was what it was, in the sense that the state managed to harmonise some of its people' s ethnic differences to a degree. It must be pointed out that it did this at a time when its political framework was far from ideal in terms of being democratically representative.	1.350999916618082
The division of Yugoslavia is probably a historical fact that we shall have to accept, regardless of the mistakes that may have been made along the way.	1.2687771929480298
We do not feel that withdrawing international forces now would be any kind of solution. Quite the contrary, it would be a solution leading to calamity.	1.1646317701584852
Mr President, I was a little disappointed with the answer given by the President-in-Office to my colleague.	1.4113139493063904
It is very important, if we stress that Europe is to be a Europe of values, that we do not go down the road of saying that means justify ends.	1.5840069651538877
If civilian targets were targeted and destroyed, killing civilians is illegal by anyone's standards.	0.7562409324339388
It should not be defended even by those of us who deeply deplore the Milosevic regime.	0.9360916931973859
That, however, is not my question.	1.377676975147099
My question is about political prisoners held in Serbia now.	0.9437044813624064
There are, I believe, around 5 000 Kosovar political prisoners held in Serbia at the moment.	0.9708882909324275
My question to the President-in-Office is twofold.	1.0764114140675736
Firstly, is the Council fully aware of and concerned about the fate of these prisoners?	1.4535143775442718
Secondly, what does it propose to do about them?	1.5954297091029002
Mr MacCormick, first of all, I would like to answer your comments.	1.0189009971543697
I did not defend attacks on civilians.	0.7395366370605643
What I said and what I explained in a previous answer is that there are civilian targets linked with structures which are objects for military action, and you know as well as I do that some military actions not only go for military targets, but also for civilian targets and structures which are connected with military action.	1.2899552404512429
What is a legitimate target is obviously a grey area.	0.9425085981591198
As I said, we are not making value judgements about specific actions.	1.1402226907372897
We are making an overall value judgement about NATO' s action, and this overall value judgement is positive. We agree with the general view of NATO' s action.	1.3773735809375771
With regard to political prisoners in Serbia, Mr MacCormick, it is obvious that, when I say that in Serbia today Mr Milosevic is not acting in accordance with the rules of a decent society at international level, I am referring specifically, not just to the way he acts towards his fellow citizens. I am also referring to the way Mr Milosevic treats political prisoners, and the way he attacks democratic rights and the opposition' s rights of access to the media, and to his attacks on the facilities that should be granted to non-governmental organisations, particularly those protecting human rights.	1.522472855695248
In spite of everything, all this represents only one of many kinds of highly pernicious action perpetrated by Mr Milosevic on Yugoslavian society, and the European Union is of course inevitably concerned about this situation.	1.3277379917577323
This is precisely why the European Union is maintaining all its sanctions until Yugoslavia' s behaviour on the international stage reflects the values that we have to defend.	1.3682194453615417
Question No 7 by (H-0035/00):	0.7674277838253011
Subject: Drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights The general public welcomes the fact that a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be drawn up. It is also to be hoped that it will meet the challenges of Europe in the 21st century.	1.0159392149804263
What are the Council's views on the substance of the Charter? What type of rights will the Charter set out (economic, social and cultural)?	0.6850199870107877
Which citizens will it cover (those of the European Union or the citizens of all European countries with a view to enlargement? Will it cover immigrants etc.?)?	0.9128498302866469
Will it set out established social rights in the European Union or will it set a broader agenda?	0.7550903031848539
What means will the Charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantees equality between the sexes?	0.6081512802432385
What are the Council's views on incorporating the Charter into the Treaty on European Union?	0.6834370251050784
I thank the President-in-Office for the concerns and certainties he has expressed about the progress of the work.	1.0965007529326074
You will understand, Mr President-in-Office, that there was a point to my question, because the Council is a political body of the European Union and the citizens of Europe, men and women, want to know how it views the democratic and social model of Europe in the twenty-first century.	1.2435649419508772
As a supplementary question, I should like to ask you whether, as the Portuguese Presidency, you have made provision for the rights of children, as such, to be included in future deliberations and the rights to be incorporated in the Charter.	1.5652898170267968
As I said, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, we are not in control of the procedure for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	1.1170236257375978
This procedure falls within the competence of the members of the group, and the matter will only be submitted to the Council if and when consensus is reached on the terms of this charter.	1.4078801717079565
I would nevertheless like to say, with regard to the rights of the child, that we consider this to be an extremely topical issue, particularly for the Council of Europe and in view of the existence of a set of relevant international texts to which we have signed up.	1.4270346997400076
This matter should form part of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	0.6112981757348745
This will certainly be the guideline that my government for one will advocate for the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	0.8818878222736416
Furthermore, we will see if we can do this for a range of other proposals that we have on this issue.	1.5272666103019399
I do not know whether these proposals will meet with a favourable reception or not.	1.1319172592662894
I presume, however, that this is not a particularly controversial matter and we think that it would simply involve bringing together the currently agreed corpus of rights, which even the most elementary justice would suggest should be included in the charter and be shared by the Union as a whole.	1.2671149442653056
I would remind Members that, according to the guidelines for these sittings, questions must be concise and be worded in a way which will allow a brief answer.	1.2654391917884962
You know that there is a Parliamentary delegation chaired by Mr Méndez de Vigo and a Committee on Constitutional Affairs where these issues can be debated at great length.	1.1638934330201816
I therefore ask that both questions and answers be very brief.	1.084989872273747
Otherwise, we would be in a way undermining the whole process of drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	1.4091046228192954
I am sure that the President-in-Office of the Council is prepared to answer everything, but I must ensure that this sitting consists of questions and answers.	1.2381481581861313
Mr Rübig has the floor.	0.8215756831469078
Mr President, fourteen Member States have imposed bilateral sanctions on another Member State, because a democratically elected government was formed there.	1.300069707483966
Both parties were once part of the government.	0.9187489477259897
So far there have been no infringements of the law.	0.9196850056652782
Are preventive sanctions reconcilable with the Charter of Human Rights?	0.8725342248048961
Would a right of veto on the part of the President-in-Office of the Council, in respect of the formation of national governments, be reconcilable with the Charter of Fundamental Rights?	1.028456381388823
Is the call for violent demonstrations reconcilable with the Charter of Fundamental Rights?	0.6506100694377708
Mr Rübig, as President-in-Office, I cannot give you an answer for the simple reason that the statement by the Portuguese Prime Minister on behalf of the fourteen Heads of State and Government of the Member States of the European Union was adopted bilaterally and not by him in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union.	1.3014338327395913
Nevertheless, I would like to say that the various preventive actions taken on a strictly bilateral basis by these Member States was actually a set of actions of what I would call preventive political action at diplomatic level. We feel that they were perfectly justified and seemed to be reasonable in the face of the actions and personalities of a party which, although it has become part of a European Union government, does not strike us as being able to guarantee that it can meet the Union' s aims.	1.344742368326354
I do not wish to dwell on this subject on behalf of the Council presidency, because my government intervened at the request of, and in conjunction with, fourteen Member States and not in its presidency capacity.	1.4564554009483468
Mr President, I have the honour of being a member of the Convention drafting the Charter so I am not going to ask the presidency to speculate on the contents or whether it thinks the Convention should be declaratory or whether it should have judicial force.	1.264042975303909
What I would like to know is what will happen to the draft Charter that the Convention draws up?	1.3190183815481649
Will the Council treat it as a document that it has to accept as it stands, or will the Council feel free to amend that document?	1.4174312858394644
Will the Council say just simply yes or no to it or will it be in a position to actually then redraft that draft Charter?	1.111675806277844
- (PT) The answer is neither yes nor no.	1.0415697790540028
I do not know, Mr Martin. It will depend on the decision taken by the Council.	1.5901202703473545
Question No 8 by (H-0042/00):	0.6187148405039865
Subject: Granting of export credit guarantees and its implications for the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey The G8 meeting in Cologne called on the OECD to set up a process for the establishment of common standards for the granting of export credits.	1.0703412319034988
These can be used to distort competition and support questionable projects.	0.9117826011223027
Will the EU take the lead in advancing this process?	0.7410089849144188
The need was demonstrated recently by the statement from the British Government that it is 'minded to grant' an export credit licence to a company involved in the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey.	0.9684906273548226
The World Bank has decided not to fund the project, which will displace 20 000 Kurds, potentially limit the fresh water supply to Syria and Iraq and cause ecological damage.	1.1375813277246931
What is the Council's view of the involvement of European governments and companies in this project?	1.3118152302774033
The process of agreeing these common standards may have started as long ago as 1978 but clearly the fact that the British Government appears to be going ahead with a massively environmentally damaging project suggests that it has not been very successful so far.	1.0970545609202973
I wonder if you would answer a question concerning investment by EU companies in the EU applicant countries.	1.1616232900640444
I ask this because of the issue of coherence, the subject of this morning' s discussion.	1.278053932894284
On the one hand we ask applicant countries to take on board the environmental acquis and yet, at the very same time, the EU Member States are supporting and encouraging investment in those countries which is itself hugely environmentally damaging.	1.3667177497544927
Can you say whether or not the specific issue of investment in applicant countries has featured in any of the discussions to date to which you have been referring?	1.241782234999553
- (PT) Mrs Lucas, I was not present at the debate you are referring to.	1.2879827157003896
I would like to say that the Council will only be able to respond to that part of your question in writing, at a later date.	1.2634936909160668
Question No 9 by (H-0044/00):	0.6195952257521357
Subject: Environmental problems caused by the Drogheda Port Company development project, and the role of the Court of Auditors A major conflict between environmental conservation and structural development interests has arisen in the area of the Boyne Estuary, Ireland, following a development project of the Drogheda Port Company.	1.2891212170196102
The affected area is designated a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the Wild Birds Directive and is under consideration for a Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive, as it is an area of international importance. Many local and European associations have strongly criticised the project.	0.9184599010835969
Similar cases occur in other regions of the Union, where EU development funding conflicts with environmental unsustainability of the beneficiary measures.	1.0507435956092823
Is not the Council of the opinion that the Court of Auditors should be given more resources in order to investigate or review similar development measures where environmental conflicts arise?	1.3610685165925536
What kind of measures does the Council plan to take in order to strengthen the review and evaluation powers of the European institutions in similar cases?	1.1755605421562965
. (PT) In response to your question, Mrs McKenna, I would first of all like to highlight the fact that the role of the Court of Auditors was laid down in the Treaty establishing the European Community.	1.3161096622245807
In accordance with Article 246 of the Treaty, the auditing of accounts is carried out by the Court of Auditors which, to this end, studies the accounts of all revenue and expenditure of the Community as well as the regularity and the legality of the underlying transactions. The Court also guarantees proper financial management.	1.3081292982335497
This is indeed also stipulated in Article 248.	0.8997074821702115
The Court of Auditors, therefore, already has all the instruments necessary to carry out its role.	1.227488098635505
With regard to your suggestion for increasing the Court' s resources, the Council considers that all of the Union' s institutions have, under the Community budget, the necessary financial means for them to be able to properly carry out their respective remits.	1.4610340346496724
In some cases, it would probably be desirable for their financial resources to be increased, but there are budgetary restraints of which I am sure you are aware.	1.3695696441413454
I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that the Budget of the European Union is approved by common agreement between the Council and this Parliament.	1.3030636126004422
The Council therefore, has no means of changing the role conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty.	1.3735447857690963
If extra resources were given to the Court of Auditors it would be money well spent, because it would ensure that EU funding was not going to something that conflicted with environmental concerns.	1.257820649322676
For years the Council has been blocking the strategic development impact assessment of plans and programmes.	1.072240126945636
I would ask you, now that you are President of the Council, will you push forward with this extremely important proposal.	1.3961228907589165
Secondly, as there is no mention of Structural Funds in the current draft could you ensure that this would be put back in?	1.6387478250448868
I would like to know what you could do about this as President-in-Office of the Council at the moment because it is the Council that has been blocking this for a long time.	1.3711965521331333
It is extremely important.	0.2902159076307632
If the Court of Auditors were able to assess regularly the potential conflicts between environmental concerns and structural development, it would be very important because the Court of Auditors could do an extremely good job.	1.2578004714053979
Their reports are extremely detailed and very important.	0.7688017053343558
This is the way to ensure that such conflicts are avoided in the future.	1.3901637241854372
- (PT) Mrs McKenna, a large part of the problem you have raised relates to issues which are the responsibility of the Commission.	1.3216211608157074
It is therefore the Commission that must ensure that certain development projects comply with relevant environmental provisions.	1.3019374635340155
The Commission will have to provide specific answers to these questions.	1.082110340165472
I do not think that I can give a more complete answer on the specific case that you quoted.	1.3331381537753642
Question No 10 by (H-0053/00):	0.7768576836821205
Subject: Statute for Members of the European Parliament The Council and Parliament are going to try to reach agreement on a Statute for the Members of the European Parliament.	1.4507346145578046
One of the matters to be settled is whether Members are to receive equal pay, and where they are to pay tax.	1.4555556854541907
According to media reports the Portuguese Presidency considers that all Members should pay the same tax, to the EU. This is in conflict with the view taken by some Member States who wish to have the right to tax their Members in their home countries.	1.4091616874451682
Will the Portuguese Presidency clarify its position on this matter?	1.0639907180045702
. (PT) The Portuguese Presidency is particularly interested in this issue, as I suppose that this is the first time a presidency has made resolving the problem of a Statute for Members of the European Parliament a priority in its programme.	1.4073562433725368
The Portuguese Presidency made reaching an agreement on this statute one of its priorities, as furthermore, did the President of the European Parliament, when she stated this at the Helsinki European Council.	1.451633216594712
We are therefore in perfect and total agreement in our concern to achieve a positive outcome on this matter.	1.178745234484356
We are therefore taking advantage of this political will in an attempt to define the outlines of a compromise, and we have already begun work on this matter.	1.2872759376712115
It is worth pointing out once more that this compromise will require the unanimous support of the Council, in accordance with Article 190, and the assent of this Parliament, to which it falls to approve this statute.	1.4191949652988913
The Presidency has engaged in intensive discussions with a range of Members of this Parliament and with the group to which Parliament entrusted the task of negotiating with the Council.	1.1379510575446137
I myself had an opportunity to meet this group, for the first time, in parallel with the January part-session, and I am trying to arrange to do so again soon in order to continue these discussions.	1.2950756394047338
These discussions have also recommenced more intensively in the relevant bodies of the Council, and I think that I can say, in a spirit of openness and greater flexibility, and because we all recognise the importance that this has, particularly for the general public, that drawing up this statute is a vital factor in ensuring both the dignity of the functions of Members of the European Parliament and the necessary transparency and good management of public funds.	1.4238209259362506
With regard more specifically to your question, I would like to highlight the fact that it only makes sense to have a new statute if it represents progress in comparison with the current situation and if it ensures that holders of identical posts are as far as possible treated in the same way.	1.1895449708265542
This has, from the outset, been the position of the Portuguese Presidency.	1.1615761030643392
Nevertheless, our role as mediator means that we must take account of all current attitudes in the Council and I am sure you are aware, Mr Sjöstedt, that the tax issue poses problems for certain delegations.	1.6201221021236951
As this is the case, whatever solution is found, I think that it will have to respect both democratic law and be acceptable to all Member States, regardless of their national positions on the matter.	1.388733973640054
What I can promise with regard to this issue is that the presidency has the utmost commitment to working, for as long as it is involved with this matter, in an atmosphere of total transparency and openness towards Members of the European Parliament. We will also make the utmost effort with members of the Council, particularly with those who had most difficulty in accepting the proposal suggested last year, so as to reach a reasonable compromise solution, and one which would at the same time guarantee the dignity appropriate for a statute for the members of this House.	1.499620819575601
Mr President, I would thank the Council of Ministers for its answer. I want to ask two follow-up questions connected with the taxation of ourselves as parliamentarians.	1.3642632309770288
My basic view is that one ought to pay tax in the country in which one lives, in which one' s family lives and in which one benefits from public services.	1.3649060654727105
I intended to ask the presidency if there really is an argument for saying that we should not pay tax in our own countries just as other people do.	1.2463999711600688
Is there any argument for our being given a special privilege just because we are parliamentarians?	1.0740697695713999
That is my first question.	1.3314049870183668
My second question is about whether the Portuguese Presidency can accept a solution which involves the tax issue' s being solved in different ways for Members of different nationalities, or whether you want a solution which is identical for members of all nationalities.	1.311673115811595
- (PT) Without wishing to show any lack of respect towards this House and particularly because of the respect that your questions deserve, I would rather not answer the questions you have raised immediately.	1.348789716693611
We are in the midst of rather sensitive negotiations.	0.9080438790389893
This sensitivity is reflected in the way in which the Presidency of the Council of the European Union expresses itself in a specific context in relation to particular situations.	1.1870839648703244
This has an impact of course, because it is read by other members of the Council.	1.279490552209524
At this stage in the discussion, please forgive me if I cannot give a direct answer to the specific questions that have been put to me. I would ask that we be judged on our results, when we endeavour to reach a more concrete solution in the near future.	1.2939571906136345
I will be happy to come back to Parliament to respond to and clarify the problems which may conceivably occur if a result is not reached, or to congratulate all of you if this result is achieved.	1.2729636359221748
I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council, after his few hours working in this Chamber with these Members of the European Parliament, whether he has come to any assessment of what they are worth in terms of pay?	1.2813568303055554
Mr Purvis, as this discussion of salaries in the European Parliament does not relate exclusively to your country and even affects my country, I have a precise idea of what the salaries of the Members of the European Parliament are worth.	1.4725799640086168
I am therefore perfectly aware of this problem.	1.1416336104364422
Mr President, I want to thank you for your answer. I want to ask a follow-up question which bears some resemblance to the one Mr Sjöstedt asked.	1.179568686617121
We both come from Sweden. In our country, we pay our tax in the form of local taxes because the services concerned are local.	1.2480306252358246
We have extensive services, too. We have problems stemming from the lack of confidence in politicians and, not least, in European politicians here in Parliament.	1.4397725948882314
How do you think that public confidence in ourselves as politicians would be affected if a situation were to arise in which we obtained the right to use services where we live - education, health care etc - but, at the same time, did not pay any tax and did not contribute?	1.1696919629545985
How do you think a system like that would affect people' s confidence in ourselves as politicians?	1.0436810209520295
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I do not know whether you are obliged to answer this question since it is really a philosophical question.	0.9777530304307992
However, if you wish to enter into the realms of philosophy, go ahead!	1.1257273236370078
. Mr President, I have no desire to enter into the realms of philosophy.	1.0831436055228663
These are fundamental issues which concern the very shape of the Statute for Members and of its role in the context of political society.	1.154035993461848
I do not want to enter into this type of discussion because I think that it might, to use a French expression, préjuger the Portuguese Presidency' s views in the course of the negotiations in which it is involved on the Statute for Members.	1.4273937644818724
I would ask you to allow me to refrain from commenting on this matter.	0.8555633099945303
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 11 to 35 will be replied to in writing.	0.9425525214281578
That concludes Questions to the Council.	0.5392710792590588
(The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)	0.47658044788114623
Address by Mr Vaclav Havel, President of the Czech Republic	0.5118038482212212
Mr President in office, ladies and gentlemen, I have great honour in extending a warm welcome, on behalf of the House, to the President of the Czech Republic, Mr Vaclav Havel.	1.3388992163531743
I should also like to welcome Mrs Havel, who is sitting in the gallery.	1.350722746996292
You are most welcome.	0.5332254619516974
(Applause)	-0.0
This is not your first visit to our Parliament, Mr President.	1.3038657296374911
You addressed plenary in Strasbourg nearly six years ago, in March 1994, and many of us, who were already European Members of Parliament at that time, still have a vivid recollection of your speech.	1.4542956117891082
In fact, shortly after the Maastricht Treaty was ratified, you spoke in favour of strengthening European values, creating a European ethical dimension and opening the Union to the countries of central and eastern Europe.	1.1070535096099772
In other words, for many citizens, and not just in your country, you personify the European values to which we constantly voice our attachment.	1.4946496851921933
There have been extremely dynamic developments in relations between the Union and the Czech Republic following two European elections and a major new reform of the European Treaties.	1.3272240193861244
An association agreement has been signed and a joint parliamentary committee has been set up by the European Parliament and the Czech Parliament.	1.2801446540562826
Your country filed an official application to join the Union in 1996 and accession negotiations were finally officially opened in 1998.	1.016481573439875
The process of European integration and enlargement has speeded up impressively since the fall of the iron curtain.	0.961240606266274
The end of this artificial separation of Europe marked the start of a new era.	1.2759668627713672
We now face an historical challenge with multiple prospects for all the citizens of Europe.	0.788765535170485
Mr President, you are a symbol of these changes.	1.4727088984394747
You founded and signed Charter 77, the human rights movement which represented and called for fundamental values during a dark period in the history of your people.	1.0319016994880175
A Communist regime sentenced you to five years in prison for defending human freedom and dignity.	0.8500929340785499
But you never lost hope and history proved you right.	0.6867286168705224
Ten years ago, the "velvet revolution" proclaimed Havel na HRAD.	0.911785326883698
For ten years you represented democratic Czechoslovakia and, later, the Czech Republic, as its president.	1.2232201565069614
Reconciliation with your neighbours was, and still is, a basic objective which you have defended with vigour and perseverance.	1.4077702069609905
You are a first class European.	0.8866848944637772
Today, the Czech Republic is preparing to join our Union.	1.0895684876981038
I am sure that you will agree, Mr President, and experience has shown us, that the process of enlargement of the Union is not without its pitfalls for both parties and the Czech Republic will need to make a great deal of effort in order to meet the accession criteria.	1.4573583256943168
The European Union, for its part, will need to adapt its institutions and policies in order to prepare for enlargement.	1.3360858551857515
It has already taken a big step forward with Agenda 2000.	1.0467420750302512
The next step, i.e. institutional reform, will be taken following the inauguration of the new Intergovernmental Conference, in which the European Parliament will be fully involved.	1.4770565405623184
Our responsibility as members of the European Parliament is to ensure that the process of enlargement takes place in an climate of optimum openness and transparency so that, when the time comes, the citizens of the European Union and the citizens of the Czech Republic will approve the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union through their elected representatives.	1.344970936543334
Mr President, it gives me great pleasure to give you the floor.	1.4788008997274396
(Applause)	-0.0
Mr President, allow me, on behalf of the European Parliament, to extend our warmest thanks for the clear message which you have brought and of which the members have already shown their appreciation.	1.3927902945552904
Thank you. You are right to remind us that a national identity is perfectly compatible with a European identity.	1.1824403619797519
And you have used your personal experience to show us that your European identity was not decreed; it was a spontaneous and natural move.	1.1948013544605607
I have taken note of your words; this is something which we all feel very deeply.	1.1691055126294447
We find you faithful to the principles which have always guided you, which have always guided your actions; your attachment to fundamental values.	1.2017641639592977
You reminded us of your speech in 1994, which you yourself qualify as slightly provocative, but there is such a thing as creative utopia and we have been able to gauge together how far we have come.	1.272592396901993
And you very opportunely highlighted the role of the civil society, the importance of the civil society, not just in the candidate countries, but in all the countries in the European Union, in restoring our citizens' confidence, in restoring confidence in the social solidarity which we need.	1.4307660629122776
To summarise, perhaps what struck me most in your speech; above all, you wished to remind us that, beyond its economic aspects, the task of constructing Europe is a spiritual one.	1.2738589821138968
We of course look forward most keenly to continuing this task with you.	0.8251332713374607
Thank you, Mr President.	0.8100041392944094
(The formal sitting was closed at 12.40 p.m.)	0.73863058836541
ACP-EU Joint Assembly	0.12884729365340947
The next item is the annual report (A5-0032/2000) by Mr Corrie, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the results of the activities of the ACS-EU Joint Assembly in 1999.	1.0673449142388576
, rapporteur.- Mr President, I had hoped to be rising at 9 a.m., not 9 p.m., to present this report.	1.4724887120483687
I hope the number of Members in this Chamber is not an indication of the interest in overseas development work.	1.3662283300453755
However, it is normal practice that the report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly is put before Members of this Parliament and I have the pleasant task of doing that tonight.	1.4942829357905076
Once again, I can report two highly successful Assemblies having taken place, one in Strasbourg and one in Nassau.	1.3813291332550763
In many ways this was the end of an old era and the start of a new one.	1.2972894229257526
The ACP-EU Joint Assembly is a unique organisation in world politics.	0.9096085262300274
Where else do 86 nations come together to discuss matters of mutual concern?	0.8911942840059078
The Strasbourg Assembly was the last chaired by Lord Plumb.	0.7423919759938541
In honour of the tremendous work he carried out over a difficult period the Joint Bureau in Nassau made him an honorary president, and we wish him well in his retirement.	1.3132966895638531
The two Assemblies have been dominated by the negotiations on renewal of the Lomé Convention and I look forward to the signature of a new Convention and its rapid ratification by all the countries concerned.	1.0855975459692744
I remember that at the last mid-term review, when I was rapporteur, the then Commissioner Marin said that review would be the last.	1.3682245604085104
Well, he was wrong, and I pay tribute to Philip Lowe and his team who have worked so successfully behind the scenes to conclude a new Convention in very difficult circumstances.	1.320089659254563
I was also delighted to hear the report this morning from Commissioner Nielson who has worked untiringly to get the right outcome to the negotiations.	1.142414870618145
I pay special tribute to him for his success.	0.8114746803865192
I also pay tribute to Mrs Kinnock and her working group for the huge amount of work they put in on the future of Lomé.	1.1046685545968307
I am quite sure that Mrs Kinnock' s report and the one on regional cooperation and integration had a major bearing on the outcome of these negotiations.	1.341400834318234
I also thank the Working Groups on the small island states and climate change and the Follow-up Group on Fisheries for their excellent reports.	1.0265410639841985
We have had question times to the Council and the Commission and to the ACP Council, and I would like to thank those institutions for their interest in our work.	1.430247581514385
The main thrust of our work in both Assemblies was poverty eradication.	0.9424846687358455
The resolution passed went so far as to say that poverty amounted to a violation of human rights.	1.081298502234594
It also emphasised the importance of abolishing gender inequalities and as I travel through Africa and see the work done by women I only wish there were more women in senior government positions and in presidential posts.	0.9770234028977697
We might then see an end to some of the fraud, corruption and mismanagement that seem endemic in some countries and that have to be stopped.	1.1614333617681318
We had, as usual, many debates on countries where there are war situations.	1.3177324303070446
I visited Ethiopia and Eritrea to gain first-hand knowledge.	0.735097189854366
The OAU is doing its best to broker a peace deal there.	0.7952146690035964
But Ethiopia is still calling for clarification on certain issues and the humanitarian situation in both countries is serious.	0.9717717237521152
We were delighted to hear in Nassau that a trade agreement was being reached with South Africa after four years of negotiations.	0.9700709494408783
This highlights the problems of coherence between the EU and the developing nations, which came to a head at the WTO talks in Seattle.	1.3059256644469845
Much work has to be done to convince the developing nations of the advantages of globalisation and world free-trade agreements.	1.1822417597013564
In Nassau, we had two interesting debates on East Timor and Cuba.	1.102892000211974
Cuba has observer status but I understand has now shown a wish to join the ACP.	1.0728194066195205
All nations from within the confines of the ACP territory who can live up to the requirements of democracy, human rights, governance and an independent judiciary are, I am sure, welcome.	1.2016774202438638
I await with interest developments in Cuba.	0.6433861963645607
When Mr Dalmau, the Cuban Junior Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed the Assembly, he did not hesitate to let his feelings be known.	1.0772028759691425
On East Timor, Mr Da Costa, from the Timorese National Resistance Council, gave a very moving address indicating that East Timor would also like to join the ACP when it becomes a state with a government.	1.264507420154356
We must give them all our support to reach that goal.	1.001377371757035
Human rights is such an important issue within the ACP-EU Assembly that Joint Vice-Presidents have been appointed with special responsibilities for monitoring human rights closely and reporting to the Assembly.	1.0892336933891293
A number of cases have been highlighted, including the child soldier issue in Sudan, where many children have been abducted from neighbouring states.	1.1728743137947546
I had the honour of being elected the European Co-President at the beginning of this fifth term and Mr Clair from Mauritius is the new ACP Co-President.	1.1234293966871103
I would like to see a number of changes to our Assembly, particularly after the signing of the new Convention in May.	1.4637945263253984
We must have more equality between our ACP partners and our European members and I want to get rid of the "them and us" syndrome.	1.072087844439018
Firstly, I would like to see a Joint Parliamentary Assembly of elected members from ACP countries and not ambassadors or government ministers sitting there as delegates.	1.1085198135393708
This I think is the new Convention.	1.2714713072712451
Secondly, the new Convention allows for regional assemblies in the six regions, which would allow us to be much more specific in our work.	1.4387810288932028
These assemblies would report back to the Joint Assembly.	0.8158547132401678
We had a regional debate in Nassau in the Caribbean and this was extremely productive.	1.3028105792056581
We are going to have one in Abuja in West Africa too.	0.9282938206681907
I want the Assembly to stop being just a talk-shop and become a work-shop for the betterment of all the people in developing countries.	1.1065786239515747
I want to see civil society given a louder voice.	1.146734513665769
But to do that we have to see an end to corruption and we have to face this head-on.	1.473440150576851
We must reward those nations which are making the effort to live by the rules of good governance.	1.0350340869067622
Equally, we should come down hard on those who are corrupt or whose constitutions do not allow the pluralist governments that we demand.	1.2465105141220172
I am delighted to see the result in Zimbabwe.	0.9497186463053315
European taxpayers will no longer accept their taxes being fraudulently used.	0.8049809918114706
A new wind of change must blow through Africa and new standards must be set and lived up to.	0.8970767653062677
The Joint Assembly should play a leading role in monitoring the enactment of good governance, human rights and democracy in cooperation with the Commission.	0.9808879873221378
I believe that as equal partners the EU- and ACP-elected delegates are up to that task.	1.428646307572492
I beg to move acceptance of this report.	0.7734739444434879
Mr President, let me begin by congratulating Mr Corrie on his excellent and comprehensive report.	1.3145472630022823
Our approach to development policy must always be based on respect for human rights and the fight against poverty.	1.075715353587658
But there is a crass contradiction between fighting poverty and the cuts in development aid appropriations in many Member States and in the EU.	1.1048657830390758
With regard to financing, we must look to the future and provide the Joint Assembly with additional funds so that, for instance, we can send delegations to the ACP states to oversee electoral processes, at their invitation.	1.5268893406610875
In future, the EU must take a far more multilateral approach when it agrees development projects and, furthermore, must coordinate more closely with the individual states in order to improve efficiency and use the funding more effectively.	1.3646615049614612
An example here could be the field of education, which will deserve and need special support in the ACP states in future.	1.3926298702956972
For instance, the very rapidly growing educational and technological potential of the Internet offers entirely new means of helping the developing countries, which at present still have modest resources, to move towards a global approach, as opposed to globalisation.	1.324401881675996
I see it as a future task of the EU to contribute in this way to the establishment of small and medium-sized enterprises in the ACP states, which can promote self-help.	1.5077800806027628
An example here is the problem in Nigeria, which imports industrial finished products from all over the world and then has to spend substantial resources on product maintenance by foreign workers.	1.2374116216582531
One way forward to promote the setting up of SMEs could be to train the Nigerian population adequately.	0.9832997678480994
It will be easier to take account of the developing countries' very diverse problems, and EU aid could be prepared and implemented in a more targeted manner if, as the report makes quite clear, we take the urgently needed step of optimising our working methods, by introducing the proposed regional assemblies.	1.3915244776559446
Thank you, Mr Zimmerling: If I am informed correctly, this is the first time you are addressing this House.	1.4508993574049984
Congratulations on your maiden speech: It went really well.	0.8613402378728559
Mr President, it cannot be repeated often enough: since 1975, the Lomé Convention has constituted an important pillar of European development cooperation and has a pilot role to play in many respects.	1.3267913145257735
Based as it is on the principle of partnership and equality, and on parliamentary control by the Joint Assembly, it is an example to the world.	1.5350596555382388
Most appropriately, given that this year we are celebrating 25 years of cooperation under Lomé, we will shortly be signing a new and more advanced partnership agreement, which also upgrades the Joint Assembly into a genuine parliamentary assembly on both sides.	1.2878484830758143
So I do not want to look back only to the year 1999.	1.3684497773354583
The rapporteur, Mr Corrie, has already done so most expertly.	1.2607830255220775
Much of what concerns us today is the outcome of fundamental processes of transformation in all parts of the world since the late 1980s.	1.1314288115452427
They also had strong repercussions in the developing countries.	0.6999987603208858
The after-shocks can still be felt.	0.7053576644018124
ACP cooperation is a dynamic process.	0.643342199536444
The content of the agreements has progressed steadily between Lomé I and Lomé VI.	0.9172637325212205
At the same time the number of partner states has increased considerably, now standing at 71.	1.1851526922852496
All those involved were particularly moved by the enlargement to Namibia and South Africa.	0.9325460637281385
Cuba has just knocked at the door, and, if Cuba is also accepted into the ACP-EU community, that will be a momentous step and will bring in its wake processes of change in Cuba itself.	1.3515004619695101
So ACP cooperation remains very exciting, and not only because of the new emphases introduced in the new Convention.	1.5036315027343201
Fighting poverty and promoting sustained economic, cultural and social development are important objectives in the endeavour to build up democratic societies, based on respect for human rights, in the ACP states.	1.1959528249998264
That also means strengthening the democratic institutions.	0.7331614100248616
The history of the Joint Assembly provides impressive evidence of a positive trend in that direction.	0.9510379121821233
In the past, the representatives of the ACP countries tended to be government members, government officials or ambassadors; but today at least three quarters of the ACP delegates are elected members of parliament.	1.220207796564652
We ought to throw a big party when the figure reaches 100% in the near future, which is indeed what the new Convention is aiming at.	1.3705317480236667
Unfortunately there is far too little appreciation of the steady advance of processes of democratisation which, unlike the various crises that arise, largely pass unnoticed.	1.0667358469037793
One special aspect of multilateral cooperation with the ACP states is regional cooperation and integration.	1.1035688135495083
There is one wish on the European Parliament' s long wish list that will be fulfilled: as we have already heard, the Joint Assembly will soon also be able to hold regional assemblies.	1.3765812786917133
Enhanced regional cooperation can help prevent the outbreak of conflicts based on ethnic, economic, social or religious factors, i.e. have a preventive effect.	1.1554931978939447
For the same reason the European Parliament has always called for civil society to be involved in the decision-making processes and in cooperation management, and emphasised the importance of decentralised cooperation.	1.264991515515748
The enhanced contacts between the Joint Assembly and the social partners provided for in the new Convention are another step in the right direction.	1.1905876725795823
But I am a little sad that the European Development Fund has still not been incorporated in the Community budget.	1.4423602943011558
I hope it does not take another 25 years before we finally achieve that too.	0.9594522619973729
Mr President, I congratulate Mr Corrie on his report.	1.1701516820498605
The Lomé Convention has been an expression of a real partnership between the EU and the ACP countries for over 25 years.	1.1384721242904852
That it has continued at all in the face of overwhelming pressure against it from many quarters, including the WTO, is a triumph of sorts.	1.3391172534287785
But of course the new Convention must be measured not by the fact that it exists but by the extent to which it can contribute to the EU commitment to poverty eradication and the achievement of the international development targets.	1.4449105660595964
Measured by this yardstick there are a number of serious shortcomings in the new arrangements. For example, the agreement is particularly disappointing for those ACP countries suffering from short-term fluctuations in export earnings.	1.1269077811684078
During a marathon negotiating session in December a compromise was reached which provided that, in respect of least-developed, landlocked and island states, assistance would be provided in the event of a minimum 2% loss of export earnings rather than the level of 10% for the other ACP states.	1.2732070581823889
But at the final negotiating session the EU claimed that it had never actually agreed to the inclusion of islands and landlocked states among those which would qualify for the support on the basis of the 2% threshold.	1.1184375677743885
This change has been devastating for the Windward Islands in particular which may be the only ACP state which will actually lose massively from the new arrangements.	1.0130299167011776
This seems a particularly perverse outcome since the Windward Islands are one of the smallest and most vulnerable of the ACP states and they are now going to have to pay the highest price for this new Lomé arrangement.	1.2397309316592857
Meanwhile, on the trade side, pressure from the WTO to ensure that any Lomé Convention is WTO-compatible has meant that there is a huge momentum behind the idea of the so-called regional economic partnership arrangements or free-trade agreements.	1.1620753098741468
Non-least-developed countries are likely to face considerable pressure to accept these arrangements.	0.9480138806875582
Yet it is quite clear that even after a transitional period a number of countries will simply be unable to open their markets yet to the chill winds of free trade without wrecking their own domestic economy.	1.0615127948144931
We therefore need to be particularly vigilant to ensure that genuine options are open to those countries which are not yet ready for free-trade arrangements.	1.2264794880099827
We need to ensure that strategies for promoting regional integration within the ACP are pursued in their own right.	1.0840436166632976
Finally, during any new trade round the EU and the ACP states should press jointly for a reform of GATT Article 24 in order to explicitly provide regional non-reciprocal trade agreements between structurally and economically dissimilar groups of countries.	1.1825049765410431
The Lomé Convention is a unique partnership; but if it is to be truly effective it needs to extend beyond the discussions within the context of Lomé and involve a participation of the WTO and a partnership in all other international negotiating fora.	1.3102702190811966
Mr President, what I want to do in this debate is condemn the fate reserved for the poor countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.	1.4471857709011966
People have the gall to say they benefit from the Lomé Convention, but even looking at trading relations alone, the Lomé Convention has done nothing to protect those countries; their already feeble share in trade with Europe has been halved.	1.1878276506578793
That reflects the growth of inequality between EU and ACP countries.	0.6576084535782145
The Lomé Convention essentially benefits a few large industrial or financial conglomerates, which continue to pillage those countries and perpetuate their economic dependence, notably on the former colonial powers.	1.1157389980384032
When it comes to so-called development aid, given that underdevelopment in the majority of these countries is getting worse rather than better, development is clearly not what the aid is for, even when it is not just a disguised export subsidy for European manufacturers.	1.4314706063986167
The aid is primarily a windfall for incumbent regimes, and the poor majority does not benefit at all.	1.2554785905678651
Even if it were properly redirected this aid would not be enough to finance the most basic infrastructure for health care, education or drinking water supply.	1.2762566059276133
For some years now the great powers have been reducing the amount of this already derisory aid, and it is the height of cynicism when this is done on the pretext of human rights violations or corruption.	1.2379706260560912
After all, who protects these deeply corrupt regimes, if not the governments of the rich countries?	1.3678199407518346
They turn a blind eye to the masters of corruption, the big groups controlling oil, water supply, or public works. They could clamp down on them since their head offices are here in Europe.	1.2562891880917153
The debate about either extending the Lomé Convention with its quotas and protectionism, or, instead, gradually winding down the special relationship between the European Union and the ACP countries in the name of free trade, is a warped debate between two ways of perpetuating the pillage and impoverishment of those countries.	1.2711999512517993
I protest against an ignoble and inhuman organisation which literally condemns hundreds of millions of human beings to a wretched death to enrich a minority.	0.823715550513739
A mere fraction of the fantastic wealth accumulated by the big groups could lift these poor countries out of extreme poverty, but, until we have the courage to take on those big capitalist groups, we are just covering up the real problems.	1.2472094933609539
Mr President, I want to thank the Co-President of the Joint ACP-EU Assembly, Mr Corrie. It was no easy task to draw up a report on a complicated forum like the ACP-EU Assembly.	1.49792128787945
In this speech, I will confine myself to addressing certain points I consider fundamental.	1.0783996609241335
I believe the European Parliament should call for the Assembly to become truly parliamentary, urging all ACP countries to send members of their national parliaments as their representatives, so as to strengthen their own democratic fabric.	1.286270862779397
My next contribution to the debate is to turn my attention to globalisation and the WTO, which is seen by the ACP countries as an enormous danger to their development.	1.491884733008307
I do believe the ACP countries need a transition period, but they also need support in the context of the new logic of regionalisation of aid, not only in agriculture and fisheries, but also in the exploitation of mineral and underground resources, some of which are being exploited, with slim economic returns to the ACP countries themselves.	1.404341386928415
Thirdly, the European Parliament - through a joint working group within the Joint Assembly - must make a major effort to achieve stability in ACP countries' budgets through the selection of budgetary items to permit economic and, above all, social development, and by monitoring income and fiscal policies in force in the ACP countries.	1.3918911553527944
We must put the people of the ACP countries first in our relationship with their rulers, who need to be fully aware that development aid from the European Union is intended for the people and not for the oligarchies that handle all the internal and external resources in some countries.	1.4162805479281166
Fourthly, and finally, the prevention of inter-ethnic conflicts between States must be our constant concern and to some extent this can be achieved either through a strong and authoritative diplomatic offensive or with the proposals I have set out.	1.2649994843360581
Mr President, I agree with the positive evaluation Mrs Junker has just made and I want to add that Mr Corrie has started his term as Co-President of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly with effective and impartial work deserving of our full appreciation.	1.13508735127823
I shall restrict my speech to one particular act which took place a few days ago, partly as a consequence of events alluded to in the report we are debating here.	1.2128963078822215
I refer to Cuba' s expression of intent, of 2 February, to become a full member of the ACP group of countries.	1.4549600334579043
A Cuban delegation attended the last meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in Nassau, and Vice-Chancellor Dalmau spoke in the plenary session, engaging in a lively debate, and afterwards held conversations with many of us.	1.164526493263823
Following Nassau, a delegation from Parliament led by Mr Corrie and the Chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, Joaquín Miranda, visited Havana and a series of very illuminating exchanges of opinion took place.	1.0091417314656213
It is my impression that this mission from the European Parliament was the final push which convinced our Cuban friends that the time had come to move forward on mechanisms of cooperation with the European Union.	1.259783316576972
We are witnessing events of great political significance and I hope that we in the European Parliament can promote the appropriate favourable view and a generous attitude on the part of the Union, so that Cuba' s aspirations can meet with a positive response as soon as possible.	1.3013577944214243
That is important, for at least three reasons.	1.1972461408648285
First, it is important for Cuba, to bring its people development and prosperity and finally break the United States blockade, which has been repeatedly condemned by the European Parliament and the United Nations.	1.4596744343675037
Secondly, we must bear in mind that Cuba' s application has the support of all the ACP countries.	1.3154716115539242
If the European Union responds positively to the recommendation of our associates, we will be proving our respect and consideration for those associates and this will have positive effects on the whole framework of our cooperation with them.	1.2847018574228017
Nor can we ignore the value of such a decision in demonstrating the consistency and autonomy of the European Union and the fact that it does not bow to pressure from any quarter.	1.1803877296740382
By accepting Cuba into the ACP community we will be demonstrating that our Europe is not involved in the shameful process of 'playing but not paying' , and that, when we get indignant about absurdities like the Helms-Burton Act, we are not being hypocritical but are ready to act and take all the consequences.	1.2671118636192935
The ACP-EU Joint Assembly meets again in a few weeks time and I am sure this subject will be dealt with there.	1.299542567409743
Ideally the European Parliament' s representatives should be able to support Cuba' s intent at those proceedings, as our parliamentary colleagues from the ACP countries will no doubt be doing.	1.2561566975119143
Of course, Cuba must meet all the standard conditions, just like any other member.	1.2873852919907545
The Cubans know that and I am sure they accept it.	1.2143734220369269
It must also be made clear that Cuba is not going to be asked for more than has been asked of our other partners.	1.1884463662116906
Cuba' s wish to join is welcome and Cuba will be welcome in our circle.	1.0175712928255467
I say that wholeheartedly, but also with the deep conviction that, just as the blockade has produced nothing but poverty and, as a consequence of that, extreme tension and a hardening of the Cuban position, the integration we are supporting here, and the prosperity it will produce, will translate into the détente and openness we all seek and from which all of us, especially the Cuban people, will benefit.	1.4576189729445843
Mr President, I also want to begin by thanking and congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Corrie, for an excellent report which I think very well describes and summarises the work which has been done in the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in the course of 1999.	1.3854698626636361
I do not have very long in which to speak, and I really only want to take up two questions.	1.5885634396415522
The first is about the fight against poverty, which I think is becoming an embarrassment both for the EU and the Member States.	1.522370309768746
In spite of the fact that, both in the Treaty and at the UN' s meetings in Rio and Copenhagen, there was an undertaking to work to eradicate poverty in the world, the budget for development aid is, in actual fact, being cut back, when the express desire was that exactly the opposite should happen.	1.4806081542348664
We must put a stop to this trend.	0.9646709129606426
We must begin by writing off debts. We must follow up words with action.	1.0873724259700743
I should like us to take a leading role in this work.	1.1970413568543894
My second question concerns the fact that, in many contexts, we talk about the ACP countries having to learn the principles of democracy.	1.4289878152239628
Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the resolution demand, within the context of the new agreement, that working methods should be developed and optimised.	1.4843491126998387
The ACP countries are to be urged to allow a whole range of political opinions to come up for discussion.	1.13404592624312
I think that is a very good idea indeed, and I fully subscribe to it.	1.8503257817031569
However, we must also ask ourselves about our own democratic arrangements.	1.3595119046518749
How do these operate within the European Parliament' s delegation to the ACP-EU' s Joint Assembly?	1.3522513700936765
In contrast to how things are done here in the European Parliament and in Parliament' s committees, where rapporteurs are nominated and appointed to produce reports, there are no regulations whatsoever applied within this delegation to the Joint Assembly. The two large groups share all the reports and consultative documents etc between themselves.	1.3246275075927607
In order to change this undemocratic arrangement, we, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, have tabled Amendment No 6 in which we request that the rapporteurs appointed to produce reports and consultative documents, together with the members of working parties, should be appointed in accordance with clear, democratic rules.	1.2566639440603058
In this context, account ought to be taken of the smaller groups, and consideration given to introducing more representative arrangements.	1.1660125324935005
Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I too would like to congratulate Mr Corrie on the quality of his report, which appropriately reflects the tenor of the debates in the Joint Assembly he so effectively co-chaired.	1.1374431199185742
The eradication of poverty was central to our work and many speakers highlighted the need to preserve an essential tool for achieving that ambitious aim, to whit, preferential agreements between the European Union and the ACP countries within the framework of the Lomé Conventions.	1.2054825825977118
The challenge was immense.	0.4415088619441869
Globalisation, free trade, and the hegemony of the WTO with its internationalist philosophy, were imperilling the very essence of the North-South dialogue.	1.2623514533369136
So we can only applaud the conclusion of a new partnership agreement for development, and personally I am convinced that the work of the last Joint Assembly did have a decisive influence on breaking the deadlock in the negotiations, as did the new climate created by the events at Seattle.	1.3648821310498884
However, while I welcome the renewal of the agreements, what I find most interesting is the new wind blowing through our relationships and finding expression in the balanced nature of the negotiations now drawing to a close.	1.3620755699942229
The European Union seems to me to have finally emerged from the old paternalist, or frankly neo-colonialist, logic where those giving aid are all too eager to start giving lessons, following a formula our friend Michel Rocard is so keen on.	1.1696029865652298
The Union has finally accepted the idea that dialogue cannot be genuine or effective unless it is the expression of a contract which respects the dignity of the partners.	1.2006552164588966
By refusing to allow the idea of good governance to become a tool, in the hands of technocrats, for imposing new sets of conditions, the European Union is demonstrating wisdom and modesty.	1.4667421334854909
We have spent two centuries laying the foundations of a democracy whose fragility is constantly brought home to us by events.	0.9825243424583685
What right have we to try to impose our model on people whose history, values and identity are sometimes so profoundly different from our own?	0.9310806978953379
Personally, I prefer the willingness that is clearly flagged up in these agreements to extend the partnership to new agents - local authorities, non-governmental organisations - which seems to me to represent the only possible way the people of these countries can progressively achieve ownership cooperation.	1.3863025334554306
In short, this is the only way they can emerge from humiliating and childlike dependence on aid and take responsibility for themselves, the proof of success.	1.2233912141833074
Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I too would like to congratulate Mr Corrie on the accuracy and rigour of the summary in his report.	1.0873848131955197
The European Parliament' s opinion on the activities of the ACP-European Union Joint Assembly has always had a major impact, undeniably contributing to a consistent policy and role for the European Union in development and cooperation.	1.3302517279198813
The important role of the increasingly parliamentary Joint Assembly in strengthening relations between the European Union and the ACP countries needs to be stressed.	1.199260982173729
In view of this positive action, there is every advantage to be gained from according the Joint Assembly a budget compatible with improving the quality of its work.	1.222269195805221
We back the rapporteur' s proposal to introduce regional parliamentary assemblies, under the aegis of the Joint Assembly, in the six regions of the Convention: the Caribbean, the Pacific and four African regions.	1.3865536262520561
These regional assemblies would monitor action in their respective areas.	0.9378003030292764
Poverty has been the common denominator of all the debates in the Joint Assembly and its eradication is the priority for the European Union' s development policy.	1.1365808263638923
In line with the resolution at the Nassau meeting, we must concentrate on meeting the poverty reduction targets agreed by the international community.	1.142534707927259
Consistency and action are needed.	0.550028778177207
The next Lomé Convention must specify the investment in education and stimulate regional cooperation and the participation of local bodies.	1.0115825597350458
The participation of local bodies is absolutely essential.	0.7361489456553846
In a wider context, the priorities, as I see it, are to convert poor countries' debt into programmes for poverty eradication and sustainable development, as well as control of fraud and corruption.	1.194448547741784
We need to make progress with concrete and consistent action.	1.2766208214563424
People in the poor countries are beginning to despair.	0.9372343188307332
I call on the Commission to act on the rapid accession of East Timor to the Lomé Convention as one means, amongst others, of promoting the eradication of poverty and accelerating its economic, cultural and social development, in order to strengthen its internal democratisation.	1.20100531452985
Finally, I must congratulate the Council Presidency on the coming Europe-Africa Summit and call on all the participants to contribute to solid practical action to promote the development of peace, democracy and the eradication of poverty in the underdeveloped countries of Africa.	1.29341407863813
. (DA) Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report and also to thank the Joint Assembly for its work in 1999.	1.201814366620385
I am also delighted to be able to confirm that I shall be participating in the Joint Assembly' s next meeting, which takes place in March in Nigeria.	1.2968373920364904
The Commission is pleased to see the Joint Assembly playing a larger role, especially in connection with promoting a more extensive political dialogue with our partners in development.	1.2530048437904773
The Commission agrees with the rapporteur that combating poverty continues to be the central objective for development policy and will always play a key role.	1.1430427601868345
In order to be able to develop, the countries concerned must, however, become actively involved in the global economic system.	1.3714284573955349
With regard to trade with our partners in development, the Commission is quite prepared to guarantee that any new arrangement will take account of the ACP countries' special economic and social limitations.	1.2972727597639897
Mrs Lucas mentioned that the Stabex and Sysmin system ought to be continued with.	0.7515838334108157
I do not agree.	1.266309860256299
That system has proved itself to be inappropriate because it is, in actual fact, of use only to relatively few of the 71 countries concerned.	1.3103581610547286
It operates too slowly, and it therefore stands to reason that the developing countries should have said yes to the new system of the future, because this will operate more flexibly.	1.5481487666027316
Regarding the future accession of countries such as East Timor to the Lomé Convention, I can only repeat what I recently said to the European Parliament' s Committee on Development and Cooperation, namely, that the door is open.	1.1745467556727534
It is the applicants themselves who are to decide whether they want to knock on the door.	1.1693181716993162
Once they have done so, we shall adopt a position on the matter.	1.2680430327403382
With regard to Cuba' s application for accession to the Lomé Convention, the Commission notes that, according to their recent declaration, the ACP States support Cuba' s application.	1.364729126540401
The EU has always called for a constructive attitude to be adopted towards Cuba, as outlined in the EU' s common position, but it has to be recognised that the discussions will be complex.	1.3464453642979537
With regard to the Côte d' Ivoire, I can inform you that the whole of the EUR 28 million has been paid back in accordance with what was agreed following examination of the financial irregularities.	1.5328538461836199
With regard to financing the European Development Fund by an amount in excess of the budget, I can say that this is being considered.	1.4467138628495977
For its part, the Commission supports this, but we cannot at this point produce new reports on the whys and wherefores.	1.4378922112579562
Concerning Article 366A, I can say that, during the negotiations for a new partnership agreement, a new procedure was established for dealing with instances where human rights and the principles of democracy and the rule of law are infringed.	1.3204602932699137
It is now the case, following adoption of the Amsterdam Treaty, that Parliament wishes, on the basis of Article 300, to be kept fully informed of all decisions, and the Commission will continue to take account of Parliament' s decisions on this subject.	1.597946653107704
There are no plans to follow the procedure involving concurrent statements in Parliament in connection with such decisions.	1.093719876910867
This would in fact demand a change to the recently adopted Amsterdam Treaty.	0.8296091881962248
Finally, I would refer to the South Africa agreement, which the rapporteur also touched upon.	1.5342829291801134
In this regard, I am simply pleased - delighted, in fact - here this evening, as a conclusion to this debate, to be able, very appropriately, to inform you that South Africa' s President has today said yes to the solution which the EU' s Council of Foreign Ministers last Monday agreed unanimously to propose with regard to the outstanding problems regarding South Africa.	1.499208397685335
So the "Grappa War" is over.	0.8893554290299067
Peace has broken out, and we can now look forward to cooperation with South Africa in accordance with the common dreams and values which ought to have underpinned the whole business from the start.	1.3574435128582427
I think this rather nicely puts the finishing touches to a debate which has, on the whole, been quite positive, and I would repeat my thanks to the rapporteur and to Parliament for the cooperation which has gone into our relations with the Third World on precisely the work in question.	1.4323220808530321
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6737777542510281
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	0.1800861409464389
Stabilisation and association agreement with FYROM	0.48465110390120497
The next item is the report (A5-0031/2000) by Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the recommendation for a Council Decision authorising the Commission to negotiate a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with FYROM (SEC(1999)1279 - C5-0166/1999 -1999/2121(COS)).	0.9027141154053979
Mr President, Commissioner Patten, today we are discussing a country that really has suffered hard times, a country that is, however, moving in a very promising direction, thanks to its own efforts and resolve and certainly also thanks to the support of the international community.	1.3761628093675253
So if the European Union, the Council and the Commission are proposing - and I assume that Parliament will support that proposal tomorrow - the first stabilisation and association agreement in south-eastern Europe, in the Balkan region - I am quite happy to use that term - it is primarily in gratitude for or acknowledgement of the fact that FYROM itself has worked its way into a good position, in economic and, of course, mainly in political terms, in face of the war in the neighbouring region and also in relation to its own minority.	1.5915976815838144
For it is no small thing to have a minority of 33% or even 35% in one' s own country.	1.545438367322562
That country and its politicians - no doubt with some differences here and there - have always done very good work, and we should recognise that.	1.3485920770133484
The Commission is proposing that we should conclude an agreement jointly with the Council.	1.2719685224068222
Let me make a few comments on aspects on which views may differ somewhat, although, even in this regard, I want to strongly emphasise and acknowledge Commissioner Patten' s activities and interest in relation to FYROM and the region as a whole.	1.2393490378386702
Firstly, there is the regional approach.	1.4245643527275393
I believe that if it is understood properly, the regional approach is both important and necessary.	1.4498384786370637
There has to be a willingness to cooperate.	1.0180444758008105
Provided it is not seen as some kind of constraint but as a willingness to cooperate, as an opportunity that each country should grasp, then this is the right approach.	1.5420422566266694
The problem is that, when we look at FYROM, we can see how very difficult it is to cooperate economically with some neighbouring countries, such as Kosovo and Albania, or to cooperate politically with, for instance, Yugoslavia.	1.443901260586895
On the other hand, cooperation with Bulgaria, and in particular with Greece, has made good progress and I think we should acknowledge that too.	1.4081178533171663
In this context, the European Union must consider, as it began to do early this week, how to include the neighbouring Yugoslavia in regional cooperation in spite of everything, i.e. without taking back any of our criticism of this terrible regime.	1.3987846476806116
Tomorrow morning I will therefore table an amendment urging that we concentrate the sanctions on the regime itself while easing them somewhat for the people and for the economy in a spirit of economic cooperation.	1.107351245699072
In that regard allow me to say, since I come from a country through which the Danube flows, that I am grateful that the Commission, i.e. Commissioner Patten and also Vice-President Palacio, with whom I was recently in Budapest, is considering opening the Danube to shipping again. That would provide for a modicum of economic recovery in this region too, which, of course, would be of particular importance to Romania.	1.5359848863418792
In my view, this regional approach, provided it is understood correctly, i.e. as a method of contributing to economic recovery in the region itself, is in fact the right one to adopt.	1.5205977840841196
As I said, it must not be perceived as a constraint nor must it be set as a precondition.	1.102961641609129
Secondly, let me say quite clearly and plainly that we want to open the way to and offer FYROM accession to the European Union.	1.2779096733139863
In our view, it would be an illusion to think there was any point in FYROM applying for accession right now, but it would also be wrong to delay discussing it until some later date.	1.2064050465064469
FYROM wants to be told here and now that, in principle, accession will be possible when the time is right.	1.2879351763657931
This country is afraid it will be in a sense sidelined.	1.4176511801331586
It sees, in the whole readjustment of aid instruments, a risk that it will no longer be the last carriage of a train heading towards Europe but that this train will continue through Europe while leaving FYROM on a siding.	1.3044484664857638
I think Commissioner Patten understands that too.	0.6417771502723293
So I very strongly urge him to make it clear in the appropriate talks.	1.2112589172869268
Thirdly, I believe that, so far at least, FYROM has shown that it is capable of using the various instruments properly.	1.3706223222058187
Even though there will of course be readjustments here, FYROM will continue to show that many of the tasks that are still being dealt with in Brussels today can in future be handled in Skopje, in the country itself.	1.321757694739103
I hope that the honourable Members will agree to support these proposals as a sign of goodwill towards FYROM.	1.26765096443116
Mr President, since the start of the Yugoslav wars, the Republic of Macedonia - I prefer to use this abbreviation - has behaved as a constructive peace-keeper.	1.6044983366934833
We would remind you of the proposals made by the governments of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time, which had non-violent liberalisation and a non-violent separation from the Yugoslav federal structure in view.	1.2506892700605985
As you can see, our Macedonian friends have always played a very positive role and it is for this reason that it should be pointed out at this stage that Macedonia is not just a pawn in our so-called strive towards stability, but actually took the initiative.	1.3075926172257935
The former President, Mr Gligorov, can take special credit for this, and the current President too has already adopted the profile of President of all Macedonian citizens, so much so that the European Union should only be grateful to have him as interlocutor in the Balkans.	1.3776287276750085
Despite the obvious reasons for any internal tension, both population groups have struck a reasonable modus vivendi and the outlook for reaching a sound solution to the remaining problems is good.	1.0782503665189032
It was, in fact, in Macedonia that I heard at the time about the Roma population actually not having too bad a time there.	1.2395993050911256
I was unaccustomed to hearing this type of comment about the Roma in Europe.	0.808274634182995
With regard to the problems afflicting Macedonia, higher education for the Albanian-speaking citizens deserves our special attention.	1.1399272280231445
Accessible higher education, with which you have a certain affinity, is an important instrument in the emancipation of population groups. I am speaking from personal experience as someone who attended the Protestant university in Amsterdam.	1.4155566097728087
I might never have studied otherwise.	0.6108243958524938
Such an affinity and this type of higher education is also important in the development of the constitutional state and for the aptly termed mainstream society which needs to be strengthened in countries like this.	1.1365113062466945
The agreement with Macedonia should partly compensate for the damage which this country incurred following the boycott we instituted against Serbia, which is at no cost to us but costs Serbia' s neighbouring states all the more.	1.205585874883265
It would be beneficial if we could reorganise this, especially vis-à-vis the neighbouring states.	1.21715062374662
It is only fair that we should regulate aid to Macedonia properly now.	1.173886127391567
We are therefore quite prepared to support the liberals' amendment to keep aid independent from the donor states' interests, for we need to give industry in Macedonia and the region the best possible opportunities with the aid money available for reconstruction.	1.3348810527271815
I am more than happy to include Bulgaria and Romania in this, as it seems to me a tactical and psychological error only to talk about the five countries of former Yugoslavia, plus Albania.	1.1668024575321065
It is important to us that the economies in the region can stand on their own two feet again, which can quite easily be done with the aid money.	1.4514454903918945
The agreement with Macedonia should be seen as a door opening to the European Union, allowing this country to join, even though this will not be the case in the foreseeable future.	1.2973278891666602
In the meantime, we constantly need to start from the premise in our policy that it is desirable for Macedonian legislation to resemble that of the Member States, and our policy should reflect this, even in the naming of aid programmes for Macedonia.	1.350549483360435
I would quote the PHARE programme as an example.	0.8876238205636247
Mr President, the name of the republic is still a problem on account of the Greek sensitivities surrounding it.	1.4230840195537209
I assume that the Member States will feel increasingly freer to use the name in their own language which fits the republic.	1.1552112139940756
If certain countries wish to use the words "former Yugoslavia" , then that is their business; others need not feel obliged to copy them.	1.155054914331507
It will not do to keep us under constant pressure.	1.0243612255773715
Hence my support for the sound report by Mr Swoboda; we have come to expect nothing less of him, and hence also my words of appreciation for the respected Republic of Macedonia.	1.4062462658298112
Mr President, let me begin by expressing my personal appreciation of the quality of Mr Swoboda' s work as rapporteur.	1.1951908871019652
Today we are expressing a positive opinion on the opening of negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Macedonia.	1.1226973671940559
We do so in the awareness that this decision, the very first relating to that area, is actually set in the context of an entirely new phase of our relations with the Balkans.	1.3869920287338509
This new phase, or rather policy, identifies the prospect of integrating the region into Europe as the only option for settling its conflicts peacefully.	1.0865123247109802
Our agreement to the negotiations, as set out in the rapporteur' s explanatory statement, is born of the conviction that it is right for Union policy to combine both a regional dimension and a more precise assessment of efforts made and results achieved by individual countries in moving towards the acquis communautaire.	1.225561794831623
This is the dual objective which I believe should be pursued. On the one hand, we must maintain programmes on, for example, infrastructure, preparations - still premature - for free trade, and encouragement of economic and commercial cooperation between the countries in the area, and on the other, it is now appropriate to create a model of closer integration with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as an example of the policy.	1.4246107624902047
And there are several reasons why our opinion can only be positive.	1.056871933487409
As we were able to ascertain during our missions to Skopje, there has been considerable progress in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as regards the economy, movement towards democracy and - an area which is difficult and contentious enough in the Balkans - multi-ethnic coexistence.	1.1882678497015353
On the other hand, the price Macedonia has been paying for the war in neighbouring Kosovo is very high, both in terms of logistic availability of NATO forces and in terms of reduced exports to Northern Europe.	1.0710332032076797
I conclude, Mr President, by affirming that this progress is indeed difficult, fragile, and uncertain and it calls for constant vigilance on our part during the various stages of close and precise inspection that have long been advocated.	1.1611818923119792
Mr President, Commissioner, I rise to express the warmth and optimism with which the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party welcomes the start of negotiations with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.	0.9938237890104579
We are extremely hopeful that, along the lines set out by the rapporteur, Mr Swoboda, this agreement can represent an example to be rapidly extended to the other countries, especially Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and Kosovo and, as soon as possible, Serbia.	1.2674973170151382
We are convinced a rapid start to these negotiations and their speedy conclusion is the only way to achieve peace in the region - peace which did not automatically come with the end of the Kosovo war - thus avoiding the recurrence of further disintegration and a return to chaos and violence, with all the consequences of that in terms of continental, if not world, instability.	1.3423765042584375
If the maintenance of peace and security is the basic motivation of the current courageous process of enlargement of the Union to the countries of Eastern Europe, that motivation must be present even more strongly in relations with Albania and the countries of former Yugoslavia. And that means decisively pursuing the kind of parallel enlargement to south-east Europe that the agreements we are discussing represent.	1.3974317927040312
It is in that quasi-provocative spirit that we have presented an amendment suggesting the transfer of responsibility for south-east Europe from Foreign Affairs to Enlargement.	1.2536837363838134
Very rapid and direct involvement of south-east Europe in the life of the European institutions has also led us to suggest that a limited number of observers invited from the national parliaments should be accepted into the European Parliament, and that staff from those countries could work in the Court of Justice and the Commission.	1.4497587444494398
But if the development in the region of a more democratic society and largely market-based economy is to be encouraged, we are convinced that immediate and concrete steps must be taken to intensify the struggle against corruption and to make international aid more effective for reconstruction and development.	1.333338202875928
With this in mind, we have presented some amendments which I hope Parliament will accept.	1.403303425285654
First, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be offered a customs tariff equal to zero for their exports to the European Union and compensation for the progressive reduction of customs duties applied by Macedonia to European products, on condition that the principle of joint customs control at the frontiers of Macedonia is accepted.	1.153097213786214
Secondly, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be encouraged, with adequate financial support, to gradually link its currency to the euro as the first step towards the Europeanisation of the whole Macedonian economy, with the additional aim of eliminating any possible corruption in the banking system.	1.3166994797854972
Thirdly, world aid and assistance coming into the region, and hence into Macedonia as well, should be clearly multilateral, and should not subject the beneficiary country to direct obligations towards the donor country.	1.3472745741545864
Mr President, Commissioner, we hope the agreement can achieve all its objectives but we cannot delude ourselves that peace, stability and prosperity in south-east Europe can be achieved without dealing with the very wide-ranging problems we are trying to eliminate.	1.2532661383071744
I am referring to the future constitutional state of Kosovo, the need to involve Serbia in the region' s reconciliation process and - why not? - new discussions on relations between the European Union, NATO and the UN, in the light of the new balance that needs to be found between humanitarian intervention and state sovereignty, which I think calls for a change in the existing UN Charter.	1.3357838489848592
Mr President, Commissioner, the war in Kosovo has knocked everything off balance.	1.089549866646479
This is certainly true for the relations between the European Union and the western Balkans.	1.131572383338031
Since then, expectations have been high.	0.8499163191854804
This applies to them and us.	1.1725463013979582
This is true on their part because - whether we like it or not - they are asking us for direct aid and they are wondering what Europe wants from them at the end of the day?	1.207987699824734
Is there any prospect of membership?	0.7553078405262826
This is very much on their minds.	1.0133466229305161
But here too, within the European Union, expectations are high.	1.1934176038293853
If we do things properly, this may well be a first taster of a genuine common foreign and security policy.	1.2247867994685506
Will the Union manage to display a united front and develop a common policy, for the first time, concerning such a difficult regulation?	1.2242800290477958
It also remains to be seen whether the European Union has learnt any lessons from the bad experiences in Bosnia when it comes to providing aid and the slightly better experiences in Kosovo.	1.2024183610812944
Can we, based on the experiences in Macedonia and in four other countries, improve on this?	0.9969767743997348
Against this background of extremely high expectations, I do not think that I am exaggerating if I say that this first step, namely the stability and association agreement with Macedonia, is vitally important.	1.3927356756940517
This is not the Union' s only contribution.	1.4710905418426465
The debate on the Stability Pact, the debate on the CARA programme and the financing arrangements in the short term are all pending.	1.1756989282880799
We are now dealing with the stabilisation and association agreements, that is to say a medium-term issue.	1.317822480328893
This is why I think that this first agreement with Macedonia is so crucial, because it serves as a model.	1.408045635569536
I am convinced that the four other countries are wondering what is going to happen.	0.9598509646645375
What does the European Union intend to do with Macedonia?	1.486325328794411
Will it do the same to us?	0.7653836135741826
This first step is so important because of this model function.	1.1563269333733992
Macedonia also serves as a model for another reason.	0.7437262615648923
The rapporteur has already hinted at this in no uncertain terms, namely, the issue of interethnic relations.	1.098570707526626
There is no need to paint too much of an idealistic picture.	1.1320165052382438
During the presidential elections, it appeared that things were not running too smoothly, but compared to the rest of the region, Macedonia could serve as a model.	1.192294648191594
We would gain a great deal if we managed to export this model to the rest of the western Balkans with the help of the Macedonians.	1.0581976130799249
This model function also applies to regional cooperation.	0.8948424525022022
I could not agree more with the rapporteur: a balance must be struck between promoting regional cooperation on the one hand and maintaining the openness towards Bulgaria and Greece, and not cutting them off on the other.	1.3018573730821434
Mr President, Commissioner, if we manage this first step successfully, we will have gained a great deal.	1.434634742607038
If we mess it up, then we will have lost a great deal more.	1.1475102934250276
Mr President, let me begin by saying that I have no problem with approving this very sound report in principle.	1.351564122192353
I just want to point to one issue which in my view is not considered in the report and which raises a major problem in relation to Macedonia and the effectiveness of EU financial and other support.	1.4052176610092886
I am referring to the sanctions against Yugoslavia.	0.6854819524940113
Do not misunderstand me: I too believe that we need to take effective action against the Milosevic regime.	1.1597392005724676
But firstly, these sanctions have a far-reaching and adverse impact on many of the neighbouring states too, including Macedonia, which find themselves in an extremely difficult economic situation as it is.	1.4302209760648865
Secondly, the entire population of Yugoslavia is being held accountable for the actions of Milosevic and his circle, which is wrong on humanitarian grounds and politically counterproductive.	1.4356619597385267
So I believe that we should take today' s debate as an opportunity to call for a rapid end to the policy of sanctions, as stated in Amendment No 10.	1.3596381229355192
Mr President, we did not need to witness the end the Kosovo conflict to reach the conclusion that, after various wars in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, with their untold negative effects on the stability of the Balkans, a global and durable strategy for the whole region is needed, aimed at guaranteeing peace and stability in south-east Europe.	1.3482704336805118
This strategy, which took shape in the Stability Pact adopted on 10 June 1999 in Cologne, considers south-east Europe as a whole, but simultaneously recognises the diversity and unequal development of the various countries that compose the region.	1.2964038886391418
The European Union' s contribution under the Stability Pact, now converted into what is called the "stabilisation and association process" , represents a development in the regional concept the European Community drew up in 1996 for the five countries of the region: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania. Its most significant aspect was the establishment of political and economic conditions intended to support the implementation of the Dayton peace agreement, and it should therefore contribute to regional stability.	1.3152560547369008
So establishing relations between the European Union and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on a completely new basis, and offering that country the prospect of full integration into the structures of the European Union through the mechanism of the stabilisation and association process, constitutes an important contribution to stability in the Balkans.	1.1569107313826694
The assumption is that the countries are prepared to accept a certain set of conditions.	1.1365867515522081
The expectation is that we send them a politically relevant signal that it is possible for them to join us one day, maintaining respect for their sovereignty of course.	1.3169099262654114
We are not deluding ourselves by believing that, once agreement is obtained, the mandate we are giving the Commission today could constitute a first major step towards peace and stability in that long-suffering region, where the people have already shown they have the right to seek membership of our area of freedom and development.	1.442819049120247
They have suffered enough, first under the Soviet yoke and then from the high price they paid for being forced to become part of the communist bloc.	1.0794604956718195
The evidence is that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is politically and economically capable of establishing new contractual relations with the European Union, going beyond the cooperation agreement in force since 1 June 1998, which in practice targets respect for the acquis communautaire, especially in key areas of the internal market.	1.2096129106047755
It is true that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia still has a long way to go, but, given the political and economic reforms already made in the context of the cooperation agreement, and with transitional periods accepted for certain domains, the country will be able to fulfil the conditions for a stabilisation and association agreement.	1.3475922488411052
We share the view that its development is a factor for stability in the region, we approve the terms of the negotiating mandate as proposed, emphasising that what is involved is a bilateral agreement with the European Union, and we agree with the rapporteur when he stresses that this is the first concrete application of an integrated long term strategy for south-east Europe, and that the issue is how the Balkans can be structured in the long term in order to guarantee peace and stability.	1.440326291172856
The various references made to regional cooperation with the neighbouring countries in fact become politically relevant in this context.	1.0133045254548567
This agreement can and must become an example to the other countries in the region.	1.0977209129759893
That is why it is so important.	0.9094941530326349
The point is that underlying this whole process is an effective political will on the part of the European Union to draw closer to these countries.	1.2571329544746508
We are aware that some of them are already undergoing processes of democratic stabilisation, that others still need to affirm the democratic authority of their governments, and that equilibrium in others depends on the military presence in the zone, but they are all countries which now know that, once they have overcome their difficulties, a bridge is available to provide an effective link with the European Union.	1.3716930376668857
Mr President, Commissioner, I am not going to join in the unanimous chorus from my fellow Members.	1.0638770382179634
I think this report is a small masterpiece of hypocrisy.	1.3361739960895433
Paragraph 5 holds up this agreement as an example.	0.8674607496274728
We know there are 13 applicant countries, from Lithuania to Turkey, and just one black hole in Europe, the Balkans, but because these countries are denied the opportunity to become applicants, we want to make them believe that this agreement is a miracle.	1.5956584322471121
Paragraph 11 indicates that symbolic measures can replace the shared political outlook represented by applicant status.	0.752791613181729
But this is not just a masterpiece of hypocrisy, it is also an aberration, because, if negotiations begin tomorrow, this agreement will be signed in a year and will come into force in three years.	1.544175242649989
And I defy you to imagine that there will not be membership applications in due form from Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia, amongst the Balkan countries, three years hence.	1.0815959857026511
A few days ago Mr Racan announced that Croatia' s formal membership application would be presented at the end of 2000.	0.9459515618045262
There are bound to be other applications and this great work, this fine intellectual architecture, will crumble, left behind by events just as we have been left behind by everything that has been happening in the former Yugoslavia for the past 20 years.	1.291442632386543
This would not be so serious if this region of Europe were not so beset by the problems we are all aware of, problems which are being addressed, but which have not yet been resolved, by the new government of Macedonia. There are the problems of coexistence between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority, the connected problems of Kosovo, the notorious economic problems, the problems of being neighbour to a particularly developed mafia in Serbia, and then there is the problem of the Greek veto which must be condemned for what it is.	1.4932158931186332
After nearly 10 years, Greece continues to prevent this country being called by its own name, and I hope the interpreters have not used the term FYROM when I have been saying Macedonia.	1.3619201308798632
It is absolutely absurd. Apart from anything else it is offensive, in my opinion, to the Greek MEPs and the citizens of Greece.	1.4335269768472516
This question needs to be resolved urgently.	1.0360230480272938
Finally, by happy chance, a letter from Mr Georgievski, President of Macedonia to Mr Fischler, dated 8 March, has come into my hands. In it, referring to Article O, now Article 49 of the Treaty, he asks if Macedonia can join the European Union.	1.4096484335583548
Why has the Council not informed us of this?	0.97091252667974
Why has the Commission not informed us of this formal request from Macedonia?	1.053337322317545
Mr President, Commissioner, the Balkans are not purely a dark cave, politically speaking.	1.1895613027387086
The decidedly positive developments in the Republic of Macedonia over the past critical years speak for themselves.	1.0014644848101122
The gruesome escalation of ethnic violence in neighbouring Kosovo did not reach its territory.	0.785721892634512
Paradoxically, but truly, the war in Kosovo Polje generated exactly the opposite effect: the perilous gap of confidence between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority became decidedly smaller.	1.105962960125237
From the point of view of the Macedonian majority, the Albanian minority behaved loyally towards the common state during the international explosion of the Kosovo conflict.	1.0385682684365594
In the eyes of the Albanian minority, the Macedonians and the Macedonian state have more than met their neighbourly obligations in respect of Kosovo' s Albanian majority who were persecuted to the extreme.	1.0274092362787457
This remarkable upshot of the Kosovar war negotiations can therefore justifiably be seen as the internal, political establishment of the Republic of Macedonia the second time round.	1.2321279762234996
Mr Swoboda' s well-balanced and laudable report fits in with this unexpected and delightful upshot on a very practical level.	0.952029851211297
In brief, the European Union knows what to do in Macedonia: to help this local port of refuge - recently used by scores of war refugees - to fulfil its role properly as a catalyst for the planned Stability Pact in the Balkans.	1.324385844695693
Mr President, as one who has been concerned with Macedonia for eight years, I have to contradict Mr Dupuis.	1.4606962945514992
What we are doing here is not hypocritical.	0.9637610956182024
We have reached a propitious moment and I think the Macedonians are glad about it.	1.1575726923918963
Please stop being so unpleasant and pouring cold water on everything.	0.6837796287232699
I think we should take a more positive approach here.	1.1823985358492068
Macedonia did not go through a war.	0.8446720029624835
But it suffered from the war in its vicinity and from the sanctions, as it is still suffering from the sanctions that were rightly imposed on the neighbouring countries.	1.2054050618562893
It suffered enormously from the influx of refugees during the Kosovo war.	0.7143867101164247
So we must admit that developments in Macedonia have followed surprisingly continuous democratic lines.	0.8355517514331139
This is a country that has difficult inter-ethnic problems to deal with at home, and is resolving them with increasing success.	1.38331974586064
Let me emphasise that we can congratulate Macedonia on its exemplary legislation on ethnic minorities and the way it applies it and that the consistent policy of integrating the 30% of ethnic Albanians in government activity, in government policy and in society, is a precondition for peaceful coexistence in Macedonia.	1.369129080722215
I am glad to see that the hope Mr Swoboda expressed in his report will be fulfilled early in March, i.e. that we will finally have an EU delegation there and that we, as the European Union, will finally have a greater role to play there.	1.3942964634403634
I believe that the opening of these negotiations on the stability and association process is the logical conclusion of a salutary and positive trend in that country.	1.3402566563464693
As a sign of our political commitment, we must finally show Macedonia in practice that we are indeed rewarding its own welcome regional cooperation by genuinely embarking on regional projects.	1.182772137527334
Let me name just two small ones: the rapid resolution of the problem of the frontier crossing with Kosovo in Blace and the creation of Corridor 8, from Albania via Macedonia to Bulgaria.	1.1185273885892983
I think Mr Swoboda has drafted an excellent report, and it has my wholehearted support.	1.2474977767049933
Mr President, I too would like to compliment Mr Swoboda on his report.	1.1284463036837942
I think it is a good thing that so many of us are expressing support for the approach he has adopted in it.	1.3120035148270575
The report tackles stability in the region in a structural manner. This is also the purpose of the pending agreement with the Republic of Macedonia which we are debating today.	1.4221859188936459
Although the actual implementation of the Stability Pact has not yet started, the Commission has already developed the new instrument, entitled the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.	1.2580544588011084
This marks the beginning of the treaty-based stabilising process for the countries of the former Yugoslavia.	1.3274265383178925
These countries do not yet qualify for a pre-accession agreement.	0.9279315890898777
The present agreement is a kind of pre-pre-agreement, but with a view to joining in future.	1.2680944441011925
The instrument of joining countries together by means of active treaties is excellent, provided that the agreements stipulated in them are implemented dynamically, so that the required stabilisation can actually be attained.	1.051894569879287
Macedonia remains a potential minefield and has a history to match.	0.8826597450849225
It does, however, have the ambition to break free from this image.	1.1468579679161655
This requires internal stability.	0.4409590843366402
The new government would like to tackle this matter and the agreement could be an agenda for reforms, including a direct role and equality for the Albanian minority.	1.4387052776200815
More than anything, the country needs peace and quiet now, in order to put its internal house in order and to find the road to greater prosperity.	1.393361851650258
We, the social democrats, would urge the opposition to back these ideas.	1.3668109118783485
They need to help support the much-praised Macedonian model.	0.8421822839241639
But the country also - and especially - needs external stability.	1.4274067559738692
What is the point of having internal stability if the surrounding environment is unstable?	1.0803413094546412
This stability is required in the relations with Yugoslavia, Kosovo, Albania and Bulgaria.	1.162370720007252
The region should recognise that Macedonia exists and that it will continue to exist.	1.081765310352908
External stability also means open borders and regional cooperation.	0.8265278386516354
Minorities and majorities need to be given room for human and cultural exchange.	1.1015734957991288
Macedonia' s stability is very much linked with the developments in the neighbouring countries.	0.9606385945416663
The Kosovo problem is well-known and the international community is present there on a massive scale.	1.1478725583326324
It seems that the Albania factor is being underestimated.	0.8838254891413856
The Union considers it untimely to reach a stability and association agreement with this country.	1.046806085254647
But what then instead?	0.44243957143623813
It is the very argument to conclude an agreement with Macedonia and not yet with Albania that cause us so much concern, so much so that a passive stance from the Union vis-à-vis Albania is really not acceptable.	1.2286417335443949
What does the Commission intend to do regarding this issue?	0.6665558416828723
Yugoslavia is just as much a weak link in the stability process and, as such, a threat to Macedonia' s stability.	1.322552782398678
We need to wait and see what happens there.	1.1379547031463264
The mood in Belgrade is becoming less predictable by the day.	0.7895884388142306
We, however, second the Council' s decision to give the sanctions a different focus.	1.3902659064619254
In this way, at least a serious attempt is being made to give the opposition, which is preparing for a new round of demonstrations, a shot in the arm.	1.4026889300340768
What else will the Union undertake in this respect if the demand from the opposition - bringing forward elections - is met?	1.345571729243547
What else can we do to support this opposition?	1.0295388676644064
Mr President, Commissioner, Kosovo was hopefully the last occasion on which international law could be interpreted as saying that dictators could persecute minorities in the most repellent way on the grounds that "it is happening within their own nation" .	1.1234195220751197
When the USA and NATO and, finally, also the EU, reacted, it was already late, in fact very late.	1.6495346697997424
A great deal of suffering could have been avoided if the EU, among others, has acted earlier and more decisively.	1.26181811555471
We, the European Union, therefore have a special responsibility to help, support and rebuild the Balkans now.	1.4691134633534773
Our absolute objective must be to create the prior conditions for all countries in south-east Europe to be integrated with other countries in the EU - economically, politically and in terms of trade.	1.2841291168077593
Fertile soil for the growth of democracy in this war-ravaged part of Europe is best provided through trade and economic integration.	1.0842551596029628
We Liberals are prepared to go a long way and to do so quickly, just as Paolo Costa reported.	1.2179856915003333
It is therefore with great satisfaction that we welcome the proposal that is now being made for a stabilisation and association agreement with Macedonia, and we thank Mr Swoboda for a very good report.	1.530827431988069
Macedonia deserves our support, especially in view of the self-sacrificial, disinterested work which the people and leaders of Macedonia undertook during the Kosovo war.	1.0451655250923562
Now that Macedonia is prising itself loose from the crushing embrace of Communism and nationalism, it is our duty to act and provide support in no uncertain terms.	1.014805487355828
We should do exactly the same for the other countries in the Balkans.	1.1689831805982471
This is an urgent duty for the EU.	1.2664134990817755
Mr President, allow me in this context to remind MEPs - especially in view of a discussion earlier this evening - of the fact that the man who is mainly responsible for war, human degradation, murder and driving innocent people from their homes is still governing what remains of Yugoslavia, namely Serbia.	1.394176389991295
The man who is accused of genocide and who ought to be brought before the war crimes tribunal in the Hague still goes free.	0.8142301304148282
I am talking about Milosevic.	0.6984800201000332
As long as Milosevic is still there and Serbia is not pursuing a democratic path, Serbia constitutes a constant threat to peace throughout the Balkans, including in Macedonia.	1.1862006419881268
Mr President, the agreement being promoted will be the first application of the Stability Pact in south-eastern Europe,	1.345265514866489
Its terms, which the Swoboda report accepts, are certainly not directed towards peace, but towards greater political and economic dominance of the country, and towards controlling its natural wealth, overexploiting its workforce and continuing to use that country as a springboard against the countries and peoples in the area who are resisting the new order.	1.354038481837538
All this, in exchange for the promise of future accession to the European Union.	1.061339343031635
The report accepts these attitudes along with the more general policy of the European Union on south-eastern Europe.	1.2370415252342815
It is characteristic that the report congratulates FYROM on the constructive stance it maintained during the NATO attack, eulogises its pacifist role because it allowed its territory to be used as a base for NATO forces, but, of course, remains silent about the indignation of its people, which was manifested by mass demonstrations during the NATO bombardments.	1.1878312161001345
Finally, because we consider that both the stability pact and the stabilisation and association process the European Union is implementing in countries in that area, will create new problems there, new tribulations for their peoples, and will reinforce the dominant role of the American and European imperialists, we will be voting against the report in an expression of our solidarity with the people of FYROM.	1.5711939564314197
Mr President, Commissioner, one of the most basic aims of the European Union' s stability and association agreement with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is to establish stability and peace in the area, and this, of course, presupposes developing and maintaining good neighbourly relations between the countries involved.	1.4017285846468466
I shall not bother you with details of the problem concerning the name FYROM, which as you must know, is the subject of a difference of opinion with Greece and of negotiations between the two countries lasting over four years, under the aegis of the Secretary General of the UN in the context of related Security Council resolutions, but also the conventional obligation of the respective parties pursuant to Article 5 of the so-termed Intermediate Agreement of 1995.	1.423313083415076
I do, however, think it appropriate to say that, at the forthcoming negotiations and with the conclusion of the association agreement, the European side must point out to the Skopje government the need for it to show appropriate constructive political will, so that it may contribute positively to a successful outcome of the talks in New York.	1.3878976405209682
I should like to hope that such an appeal from Europe, with parallel emphasis on the difficulties that any further indecision would create for completing and implementing the association agreement, would be duly heeded and appraised accordingly by the Skopje government, so that it can respond appropriately, on the one hand, to Greece' s demonstrably conciliatory attitude concerning the specific issue, and, on the other hand, to the more general practical, declared intention and disposition of all the partners in the European Union, including Greece, to facilitate and support FYROM' s progress towards a United Europe.	1.3255604743434997
Mr President, this is because I do not think that the harmonious day to day relations, contacts and communication between FYROM and Greece that have actually been achieved at both bipartite and multipartite level, and this mainly thanks to the practical arrangements of the intermediate agreement, I repeat, I do not think these sufficiently cover the conditions and criteria of good neighbourliness necessary, inter alia, for negotiating and concluding an association agreement.	1.3095633044563155
On the contrary, I think that this demand can only be considered satisfied by a de jure full normalisation of FYROM' s relations with all its neighbours.	1.1294980606715737
That, combined with the essential improvement of certain aspects of the internal situation in that country, in the area of minorities and democratic institutions, would round off the image of political maturity which FYROM has, in fact, presented in other respects and which has made our European family welcome closer relations with it.	1.3893440199688192
Mr President, the agreement we are debating today, as analysed by Mr Swoboda, which I hope we will adopt tomorrow, constitutes the second politically positive step, after the stability pact for the area.	1.5904078029521225
There is another small step, which is related to the recent partial lifting of the embargo decided by our 15 governments for Yugoslavia.	1.1979163173943146
For about 10 years, the situation in the area has been fluid.	1.4065468030417798
Both as an historical period and, in particular, as a political period, 10 years is a very long time.	1.5727614047243286
Under those conditions, then, there has been a real failure.	1.0795215318072897
In that sense, the agreement we will be voting on tomorrow, which contributes towards stability in the area, is de facto a move in the right direction.	1.3756443276121417
In essence, FYROM is a miniature version of the former Yugoslavia, regardless of where one or another minority holds supremacy.	1.0056062086285602
From that standpoint, the fact that so far it has resisted any influences from its wider environment is a very positive element and under no circumstances should any of us, any State, any policy or any view, impel that small republic towards external, disruptive movements in an effort to solve other problems, granted - let it be noted - that it has institutions which it can build upon still further and so become a real democracy.	1.3407484225486088
In that area, there have been various policies from time to time, and what the European Union should guard against is the risk that, for ultimately superficial reasons, it may help to create banana republics elsewhere.	1.5638946045653064
We must be sure that, in seeking allies in the area, we must not always choose anyone who offers.	1.48405161656864
We must choose those which are moderate, which have breadth of vision and which have a perception of peace and stability in the area.	1.2857657430143983
I hope and wish, and am indeed certain, that the European Union, with maturity and with the measures it has begun to adopt, will little by little construct, in the wider area, the necessary environment which it needs itself.	1.5438965311949775
Let us not deceive ourselves: a Europe, one part of which is being held back because of frictions, misinterpretations and conflicts, and because of nationalistic clashes, will never be a Europe that has brought its own house to the level it wants.	1.5665277324657105
In any event, speaking now as a Greek, I want to tell some of the speakers I listened to earlier that much of what was said is fixated on other times and places.	1.1855118173108727
They have quite failed to grasp the new conditions created in the area; the new and positive conditions which have been created, in very many cases on Greece' s initiative.	1.441012249485681
You should know that the country which cooperates most with FYROM and has the best relations with it, in the entire area, is Greece, and this has contributed greatly to the stability of the area.	1.4239374362285528
I say this just so that we know where we stand.	1.3863079214320573
. This has been a very interesting general debate about the Balkans as a whole.	1.2446768141339157
It was none the worse for that, but perhaps I will be forgiven for concentrating very largely on the report because there are some extremely important issues that I want to touch on.	1.3928023877374347
I am delighted to be able to be able to set out the Commission's position on the report.	1.3767195423233995
It is very helpful.	1.1589604880767628
It is an excellent contribution by Mr Swoboda and his colleagues.	1.3441797446529378
We are very grateful for his leadership on this issue and for that of some of his colleagues, a number of whom are in the House this evening - Mrs Pack, Mr Lagendijk and others.	1.4567147562433491
I am very pleased that at our overall relations with FYROM are in such a good state.	1.1016648794829547
Perhaps Mr Dupuis will forgive me for using that expression - both he and his interpreter - in the spirit of entente cordiale.	1.1878336972099697
That has been helped by our excellent European Union representative in the country.	0.9810139353907253
He has been a great friend to Parliament and a great servant of the Commission.	1.2623865126749847
The imminent commencement of negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement is the most powerful example of our good relations.	1.1651840470488795
So to is the cooperation of FYROM in the rebuilding of Kosovo.	0.8942796067495068
I am grateful to the authorities in Macedonia for their assistance in recent weeks in helping to cope with the considerable difficulties with the power supply in Kosovo.	1.0688620021902837
Like honourable Members I recognise the stabilising role that this country has played during the Balkan tragedy, in particular when it comes to integrating the Albanian minority into the political and social life of the country.	1.4048060859859728
I saw the newly-elected President Georgievski a few weeks ago and I was extremely impressed, as others have been, by his commitment to multi-ethnicity and pluralism.	1.2392686697424633
Let me set out where matters now stand on these negotiations to which - as Mr Lagendijk said - other countries in the region are looking with very considerable interest.	1.2541225246359666
The Council adopted on 24 January this year its negotiating directives for a stabilisation and association agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.	0.6584900890206714
This represents the most important step forward in the stabilisation and association process of the western Balkans region initiated by the Commission in May 1999.	1.288677272137977
Let me make clear the main elements of those draft directives.	0.9345938398000254
They cover the inclusion in the agreement of arrangements establishing a political dialogue with FYROM.	0.9540278340492069
They cover provisions for enhanced regional cooperation including the prospect of establishing free trade areas between the countries of the region, though I must make it clear that there is no question of any attempt to recreate the state of Yugoslavia.	1.1240351975697673
They cover the prospect of the establishment of a free trade area between the European Union and them within ten years of the entry into force of the agreement.	1.173901742360249
They cover provisions on the movement of workers, freedom of establishment, supply of services, current payments and movement of capital.	0.9423707316178179
They cover a commitment by FYROM to approximate its legislation to that of the European Community, notably in key areas of the internal market; and they cover provisions on cooperation with FYROM in a wide range of fields, including justice and home affairs.	1.2685553951549742
We are now making in the Commission the necessary preparations so that negotiations can start in March.	1.3213795894865632
I am due to visit FYROM in the second week in March.	0.9658362354849941
I hope to be able to set the process in motion then, although the formal negotiations will start very shortly thereafter.	1.2567194165191522
At the time of that visit I will also, as recommended by honourable Members and others, be upgrading our representation in FYROM.	1.2977744818048638
The target date for concluding the negotiations is December this year but this will depend to a very large extent on the goodwill and determination of the negotiators.	1.0098890206027784
The agreement could enter into force in three to four years from now, given the time needed for ratification in Member States' parliaments.	1.2073465042283273
I should like to comment very briefly on a number of other points in the draft resolution.	1.263510403853101
We accept that the agreement should to a certain extent serve as an example for other such agreements, although obviously we will also want to take account of the fact that we are dealing with different countries, each of which has its own identity and its own concerns.	1.3404649612935988
I share the wide-spread concern that we should treat each country on its merits and not shackle everyone to the pace of the slowest in the development of relations with the Union.	1.0983978550169027
That has never been the intention.	0.792242128211712
The very fact that negotiations are beginning first with FYROM, before all the others, is evidence that we can and do differentiate.	1.404392888325007
On the provision of regional aid referred to in the report we agree that our technical and financial assistance should go in part to projects having a cross-border or regional dimension.	1.167770807751595
We agree that there should be an evolutionary clause on the prospect of EU membership contained in the stabilisation and association agreement.	0.9534033273146826
It will reflect the European Union's position on its relations with the countries of the western Balkans as set out in the Cologne European Council conclusions.	1.1992917264579248
We strongly agree on the need to decentralise our assistance programmes to the maximum possible extent.	0.8521463778788789
As for the arrangements covering European Union assistance to the western Balkans, Members will be aware that we are drawing up a new regulation to simplify and streamline their management and to put everything under one regulation.	1.2965109938797847
I am aware that there is concern in FYROM and elsewhere at the end of the PHARE programme in these countries and, especially, at the loss of association with the PHARE name.	1.2512665022550558
I note with considerable concern what Members say on this score.	0.8279372144374996
I will take another look at the issue, although I should point out that having two PHARE programmes up and running risks real confusion.	1.165305116274042
I want to stress, however, that whatever the programme is called, our commitment to the integration of FYROM and its neighbours into the European family is stronger than ever.	1.3774688469443441
In general I trust that Members of this House will share my pleasure that Macedonia has reached this stage relatively rapidly.	1.0698445172908182
I hope that the other countries of the region will redouble their efforts to make similar progress.	1.2968073661651032
I look forward to many similar debates to this over the next few years marking, I hope, the success of what we are trying to do in the Balkans which, for me, remains the single most important litmus-test of what Europe is able to do on its own doorstep.	1.36770374141945
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.	0.618741388554918
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.	0.251962532894286
Agreement on comitology	-0.0
The next item is the report (A5-0021/2000) by Mrs Frassoni, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on the implementation of the new Council decision of 28 June 1999 on comitology (1999/468/EC).	0.9883075457211369
. (IT) Mr President, the approval of this agreement with the Commission on procedures for implementing the Council decision on comitology marks the end of a saga which has kept Parliament busy for two years, along with a few enthusiasts scattered among the various institutions of the Union, whom many people do not hesitate to call masochists.	1.2675667916254727
Until 1993, the way the Commission exercised its executive powers, and in particular the mysterious and even suspect committee arrangements, was creating conflict and mistrust between the institutions, and threatening to have serious consequences on the legislative procedure.	1.3280410593144192
That is why, in accordance with Declaration No 31, annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Union institutions have undertaken a complex task of negotiation and consultation, resulting in the new Council decision, which revises the old system quite substantially, although we are not entirely satisfied with it.	1.318701110075556
In particular, the decision outlines a form of parliamentary control whereby Parliament can sound the alarm if an implementing measure, deriving from an act adopted under the codecision procedure, oversteps the implementing powers delegated to the Commission.	1.0045437686162302
During the protracted interinstitutional negotiations - which saw Parliament actively involved, thanks to the work of the rapporteur, Adelaide Aglietta - it was understood that the European Parliament and Commission would conclude an interinstitutional agreement on the procedures for implementing certain aspects of the new decision. On the one hand, certain points which the Council did not intend to incorporate into the decision were to be made explicit and, on the other, the system for providing information about implementing measures and monitoring them was to be organised more precisely.	1.4114156632852195
During the trialogue held on 6 October 1999 in Strasbourg, the Presidents of the European Parliament and the Commission approved the idea of concluding this agreement soon.	1.2185426900872303
We believe we have respected that commitment, and indeed this was made relatively easy by the climate of trust and mutual respect evident throughout the negotiations with the Commission.	1.135168134711951
Essentially, the agreement deals with two points: one is the right of the European Parliament to be informed, which is the sine qua non for the genuine exercise of its right to intervene pursuant to Article 8 of the decision.	1.370633514310733
Hitherto, such information had been supplied on paper and unsystematically, and was of no use to our services; and indeed this was often the fault of Parliament itself.	1.288576349722164
From now on, the information will be provided by means of an electronic system called CIRCA, to which the European Parliament will have access. This represents a real innovation, not only for us, but also - I am sure - for the Commission.	1.5667235109391575
The other point is that Article 8 of the Council decision does not specify either the method by which the European Parliament is to sound the alarm, or the time limit within which it must exercise its restricted power of control.	1.3789354820522364
Paragraphs 6 and 7 of the agreement confirm that, as a general rule, the European Parliament will adopt its resolution, stating its reasons, at a plenary sitting and has one month to exercise its right of intervention before the Commission adopts the draft implementing measure.	1.3682619999077295
But we all realise that it is not always possible to wait a month before implementing a measure.	1.3182009904846899
Therefore, the agreement contains explicit provisions on urgent procedure, including possible action by the committee responsible.	1.530000154710527
I want to end by stressing that we cannot assess whether this is a good agreement or not, we must wait and see how it works in practice.	1.4603246708709632
The European Parliament needs to acquire the resources, which it currently lacks, to ensure efficient monitoring of implementing measures, and the Commission must accept that some of its practices need reorganising to provide proper information to Parliament and ensure that control can be effective.	1.5028360136800822
Finally, it needs to be borne in mind that - whatever happens - the real solution to the problems of comitology for the European Parliament is still to change the procedure for implementing legislation laid down in the Treaties, and gradually to dismantle the committees whose existence represents an anomaly that severely restricts the Commission' s executive power and may prejudice the European Parliament' s legislative powers.	1.402291736078658
Mr President, comitology is a concept most people do not know how to handle and hardly anyone knows what it means.	1.24772553249717
It makes them think of secret societies and conspiracies, which is the way things used to be.	1.2170536645015704
In fact, it implies nothing other than fixing the procedures for the exercise of the implementing powers conferred on the Commission.	1.0874853892861596
The procedures for exercising these implementing powers take the form of a limited number of committee procedures.	0.9297160373078823
Up until the Amsterdam Treaty, there were about 20 variations of these committee procedures, which created neither clarity in the implementation of legislation nor transparency for the citizens.	1.277438365496939
On the contrary, for a long time even the European Parliament was not informed.	1.681821071553051
For the European Parliament, the first step in the struggle for more transparency in this jungle of committees was to be informed, at least, of all that the European Commission intended to regulate in the context of these various committees.	1.5622438979289897
Agreement was reached in 1988 in the form of an exchange of letters between Lord Plumb and Mr Delors.	0.9098349152014832
A further step towards transparency and the involvement of the European Parliament came with what is known as the modus vivendi of 20 September 1994, which granted Parliament the right not only to be informed but also to intervene in certain cases.	1.347475655376032
It also gave it the possibility of scrutiny.	0.7509952444700824
With the Amsterdam Treaty, the situation improved decidedly when the number of committee procedures was drastically reduced - as the European Parliament had long wanted - to three procedures, the administrative procedure, the regulatory procedure and the advisory procedure.	1.468098859372836
Now, following the Amsterdam Treaty, the rights of information and control granted to the European Parliament in the past need to be enshrined anew in an interinstitutional agreement.	1.440602299435737
Mrs Frassoni, our rapporteur, has done very careful work and identified the questions that have to be clarified in the context of that interinstitutional agreement and the administrative procedures that may have to be changed within Parliament.	1.4559731385822636
A key problem is the time factor.	1.077093069475444
When the European Parliament is informed, it generally has to adopt a position within the very short timeframe of four weeks, should it so wish.	1.4637893953796801
In matters relating to the health and safety of the people of the European Union, the European Commission, as guardian of the Treaties and the only institution with the right of initiative, must be in a position to react very rapidly, if necessary within a few hours or days.	1.4792357074924676
Nevertheless, the European Parliament must retain the right to be informed and where appropriate also to react.	1.429747835335617
Our rapporteur identifies very useful solutions to these difficulties, which I and my group can only support in full.	1.210001800908123
I just have one more request.	0.8373033851905962
In the German version, paragraph 2 of the resolution has been translated rather misleadingly and I urgently ask for clarification, which I would also like to see in the printed version later.	1.2797136810973597
In my view, instead of "weitergeführt werden müssen" the wording should be "erhalten bleiben müssen" .	0.8340531769952404
The German version is not very clear here.	1.0784301611511609
I would ask for that to be checked again.	1.279302381063666
For the rest, I warmly thank our rapporteur.	1.219143178992517
It is a difficult subject and I hope we have managed to make it somewhat easier to deal with now.	1.5083971615232596
Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on her report.	1.1594898175638373
I must add that it is a welcome change to see Mrs Frassoni in such a conciliatory mood and willing to reach compromises with the other institutions.	1.1820427306484582
When it comes to the IGC, she is one of what the French call "les pures et dures" : no compromise, no deals with the other institutions; we would rather see the whole thing blocked than compromise our positions.	1.2840445516328605
Yet here she is willing to accept the steps forward that have been achieved, which are far from matching Parliament' s original position on the issue of comitology.	1.2293012495433766
Let us remember what is at stake here.	0.8915238876340896
Parliament had four main criticisms of the comitology system as it existed prior to the new Council decision supplemented by this interinstitutional agreement.	1.0092666066633436
Firstly, the whole system is obscure.	1.6123887510101913
It is not transparent with hundreds of committees meeting with secret agendas and nobody knowing who is on the committees.	1.1192444145248763
Here is a real step forward, in the new system that has been agreed.	1.6556907171021285
We are to know who is on each committee.	1.2825271883860456
We are to know when they meet.	1.101898138585999
We are to get the agendas.	1.0232725907832303
We are to get the documents that are sent to them.	1.049402168134552
The whole system will be more open and transparent - if still rather complex.	1.3408633869667355
So that is at least a step forward.	1.205990397206274
Our second criticism is that the system was very restrictive of the Commission.	0.991689163640164
We adopt legislation in the European Union.	0.6582810304879244
We expect the Commission to implement it.	0.9227472215566941
And then we have a system designed to hinder the Commission and make it more difficult - especially what was called the "contre-filet" system, under which the Council could block the Commission by a simple majority even when the Council was not capable of finding an alternative to the implementing measure concerned.	1.325335025338603
Here too there is at least some progress.	1.0143838941636922
The Council will no longer be able to block implementing measures indefinitely beyond the three-month period unless it has a qualified majority to block it, in other words, unless there is substantial opposition among the Member States represented in the Council.	1.220066827547357
That is a more reasonable system.	1.164349393472366
That, too, is a step forward.	1.2594112130345392
But on our other two criticisms, we are less satisfied.	1.2480433462587344
The first criticism is of the system whereby the Commission is monitored, scrutinised, controlled if you like, only by a committee appointed by Member States or the Council not by Parliament.	1.4001097544746823
The legislative authority, Council and Parliament, should be equal.	1.0203497475607752
We confer implementing powers on the Commission, but then it is only a Council or Member State appointed body that can blow the whistle and say no to the Commission and stop the implementing measure.	1.398515468882517
Parliament has no equivalent power.	0.698388717370586
True, we are now given the beginning of such a power in this new system.	1.526603842462385
We are to receive all the draft implementing measures forwarded to a committee at the same time as it is sent to the committee.	1.4525626997090335
We will have the chance to scrutinise, to debate, to question.	1.5477682969528954
But we will only have the right to formally challenge the Commission if we think it has gone beyond the delegation that we have given to the Commission in the legislation.	1.4543337870714592
In other words, we can challenge the measure for being ultra-vires but not on its content.	1.1208477894263036
And in a democracy, Parliament should be able to challenge the content.	1.2958203482443333
Not that we do so every week.	1.2702794754562017
We are not seeking to immerse ourselves in implementing decisions, but it is a democratic safeguard that we should be able to do so on those few occasions when it really would be necessary.	1.4515971002569756
That is lacking in this new system, or at least is only there in embryonic form.	1.1122870260985052
Finally, our fourth criticism is that if an implementing measure is blocked through the comitology system it is referred back, not to both branches of the legislative authority, but to the Council alone, which has the right possibly to take an alternative measure.	1.508139150897845
That is not correct.	0.9725596981148759
Both branches adopt the legislation - Council and Parliament - that confers implementing powers on the Commission.	1.1643469252547358
If such implementing measures are referred back, it should be to both branches, not to one branch alone.	1.3493004436506257
Overall we have a system which has made some progress.	1.4016307188522104
The supplementary aspects that arise from the interinstitutional agreement with the Commission are welcome, but that could not change the basic decision of the Council.	1.3854641032682262
Even here, we have renounced voluntarily - because this did not happen automatically - the Plumb-Delors agreement as part of the overall compromise.	1.542179849158043
We have been willing to relinquish the provisions in that.	0.9651541771316733
We shall have to be very vigilant on what used to be covered by that agreement and is not fully covered by the new decision.	1.3253311902106724
We must be very vigilant.	1.0975792321234101
So it is a step forward.	1.0487785686935334
My group reluctantly accepts it as a step forward.	0.8493111413650348
We are not as enthusiastic about compromising as Mrs Frassoni.	1.0426305322828262
We recognise that there are limitations and the issue will no doubt come back in a few years' time.	1.1795497347262665
If we want a Union that is democratic and transparent to the fullest degree we will have to revisit this subject.	1.1585263845326015
Mr President, first I want to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Frassoni, for her work.	1.4490958114151196
It is never easy working on comitology.	0.6815663808513623
Mrs Schleicher referred to a kind of committee magic, something we have long talked about.	1.054204618538924
Certainly the process has always been very complex, as a result of historical decisions, and these must eventually be rationalised.	1.3658465512494522
In my opinion, the agreement reached between Commission and Parliament is a clear rationalisation of the process.	1.378695815767551
From our point of view, it satisfies the fundamental interests of Parliament.	1.1596842999445554
Mr Corbett set out Parliament' s concerns.	0.7125591566498668
He says some of them have been satisfied and others have not.	1.16961924780261
I would say the ones the Commission was able to satisfy have been satisfied.	1.3089399254327847
Mr Corbett is raising issues the Council decision does not cover, and unfortunately we can go no further on those.	1.2388995930928939
So how far have we come?	0.7056132692142649
There is no doubt that we have reached a fundamental point, highlighted by Mrs Frassoni, given that we now have an automatic information system.	1.2824563924976426
This will facilitate two activities Parliament is especially interested in.	0.8406277240550936
One is knowing how the committees operate, about their composition, agendas, descriptions, and so on, and the other is the right of scrutiny over actual decisions.	1.295695327654792
I think this is a good agreement.	1.1855073095250452
It is a good agreement which undoubtedly improves the transparency of the process.	1.0854555908423758
From here on things are going to be easier.	1.0152529971014572
But the agreement we are reaching today should not be regarded as a backward step compared with the Plumb/Delors Agreement.	0.9110806762028265
Mr Corbett referred to that, but the new model is certainly much more complex, different because the situation is now different, and, in our opinion, much more coherent.	1.3798737055259638
We have made a start, and we hope the work will produce some excellent results.	1.430009419363462
We think there are other positive advances too.	0.9515342260036389
To a certain extent we have gone beyond agreements which are already dated and, by realigning old procedures with the new situation, we aim to clear up everything still outstanding from the past.	1.3635171088639069
From the Commission' s point of view, our conclusion is that this is a good agreement, and we want to thank the Members of Parliament who worked on it - especially Mrs Frassoni.	1.5849510412470404
We hope that this new climate means we have achieved the result we were seeking, which is greater transparency and better information about the decisions of the Commission as an executive.	1.4906537266225464
Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira.	0.7098551447841881
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.	0.251962532894286
Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure	0.11878342076023396
The next item is the report (A5-0013/2000) by Mr Knörr Borràs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on a proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (COM(1999) 444 - C5-0174/1999 - 1999/0196(CNS))	0.7015578762562982
Mr President, I am also pleased to welcome the Spanish Commissioner, Mr Solbes Mira, whom I have congratulated more than once, inside and outside this Parliament, on the excellent work he did in Spain on the subject of European convergence.	1.416149817151765
The proposal for an amendment to this regulation on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure, annexed to the Treaty of Maastricht, raises fundamental issues concerning the switch to the 1995 European system of accounts, which, as you know, replaced the previous System of Accounts adopted in 1979, and in particular the emergence of new financial product categories, consistency in the calculation of the ratios of government deficit to gross domestic product on the basis of ESA 95 and, finally, recognising the importance of calculating interest expenditure and the consistency of the latter with this new methodology.	1.138720284024994
In our view, the main purpose of the proposal for a regulation is to update the definitions and the assessments of some of the economic operations involved in the calculation of deficits, as reflected in the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Treaty of Maastricht, which lays down the maximum percentages which the government deficit must not exceed as a ratio of GDP at market prices in the various Member States.	1.2621540471034245
To date, the Member States have calculated this GDP in accordance with the criteria laid down in ESA 79.	1.2522541109251426
The most recent estimate of the deficit was submitted in September 1999 and it relates to the 1998 financial year.	1.0388327701732556
Therefore, if the regulation is adopted, the estimate which is due to appear in March 2000, the first estimate of the deficit for the 1999 accounting year, will be made using the new system.	1.4193185540133955
We know the Member States have done their duty - if I can use that expression - doing their calculations and preparing their national accounts in line with ESA 95, and they have already published their corresponding estimates.	1.4289108188576023
In addition to incorporating a new methodology, this has meant making slight changes to most accounting aggregates and operations, on account of the aforesaid methodological changes, and also the improved statistical information included in the estimates.	1.29236717320967
These changes may of course alter the government deficits in terms of the Member States' national accounting.	1.1803494308555909
I will now describe, very briefly, the five areas where the most important changes may occur.	1.4476799839120262
First, the adjustments to the scope of what is meant by 'government institutional sector' under ESA 95.	1.1352023256964137
This is important, since government deficit means the deficit accumulated by all forms of government.	1.109145398715866
The non-availability of precise criteria for the definition of government deficit would produce distortions in the estimates of the Member States' government deficits.	1.092361598521023
Secondly, the deficit - or, if applicable, the surplus - means the ESA 95 government sector' s net borrowing requirement or lending ability respectively	1.299472374494814
Thirdly, government investment means the gross fixed capital formation of the general government sector, as defined in ESA 95.	1.4586431611389274
Fourthly, government debt is defined in accordance with ESA 95, as are the flows or interest stemming from assets/liabilities.	1.161415093782775
Fifthly and finally, the aggregate to which government debt will relate will be gross domestic product at current market prices, estimated in accordance with the 1995 European System of Accounts' definitions.	1.0424441550769035
To summarise, I consider that this proposal constitutes a satisfactory adaptation of the criteria laid down in the 1995 European System of Accounts, and I therefore approve it in full, as did the committee.	1.3779534918611738
Mr President, Commissioner, let me say at the outset that my group welcomes this proposal because it makes the basic statistical data for an economic and monetary union directed at stability and real growth more harmonised, directly comparable and more accurate.	1.239185081718334
We have already heard about the various aspects involved.	1.1559922741020061
What I think is crucial is that henceforth the statistical data will be more reliable and comparable.	0.9430618808424615
