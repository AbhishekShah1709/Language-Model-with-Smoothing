Introduction: Avoidance of extracorporeal circulation during beating heart surgery (OP CAB = Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery) for aortocoronary bypass grafting (ACBG) is gaining increasing importance in modern cardiac surgery.	1.211533386395995
With the development of new mechanical stabilization devices, the revascularization of the posterior wall of the heart and the distal rith coronary artery became feasable.	1.0300731076132872
Especially high-risk patients with multiple risk factors for open heart surgery will profit from this approach, because the negative effects of the extracorporeal circulation are avoided.	1.2348418610266116
Although dementia is described as one of the constituent characteristics of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), alongside gait disturbances and urinary incontinence, there is a rather limited number of controlled studies concerning neuropsychological deficits in the disease.	1.1282472888744959
A wide range of psychopathologically relevant symptoms have been described, but the common features of most cases include mental and motor slowing, apathy, emotional indifference, anosognosia, memory and attentional impairment.	1.0766994582049194
A number of other functional deficits such as dyslexia, dysgraphia, acalculia, apraxia can also frequently be found.	0.8479342600864185
Some emphasis is put on the work of J. de Mol (Brussels) which appears to be most important for the study of neuropsychological symptoms in NPH patients.	1.0280508518288398
The methodological standard of a number of studies has been found to be rather low, and yet a sound neuropsychological investigation may be of utmost importance for the diagnosis and neurosurgical outcome assessment.	1.2037663304618884
Concerning morphological correlates of the functional deficits in NPH, various hypotheses have been formulated, but it is argued that symptoms can neither be described as predominantly "diffuse" in nature, nor can they be reduced to unilocular dysfunctions.	1.1618592268538765
Recommendations for future research strategies are formulated.	0.7161087840949213
Up to now there are no published results of therapy of paraphilia (Pedophilia, Sadism) and sexual aggressive impulsiveness with LHRH-(luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone) Agonists in the Germanspeaking countries.	1.095753606253554
In this report we describe 11 patients which were treated with the LHRH-Agonist Leuprolide Acetate in a period of 12 months.	1.0499801257383974
The patients showed no tendency of sexuell aggressive behaviour and reported an evident reduction of penile erection, ejaculation, masturbation, sexual deviant impulsiveness and phantasies.	0.9171778126941209
One patient died from suicide.	0.9890185122483174
In combination with other treatments LHRH-Agonist seem to be a very promising alternative to cyproterone acetate and its possible carcinogene effects.	1.034222529951761
Aim of the study: To investigate the long-term effect of TNFR55-IgG1 in patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis refractory to multiple previous DMARD treatments.	1.0651562445326594
Methods: Between 1994 and 1995 we recruited 80 patients for two double blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trials.	1.0873260675727487
All patients were treated for 2-30 months with a glycosylated fused protein consisting of two human p55 TNF receptors linked to a human IgG1-Fc.	1.0322686994963535
The dose range was 2.5-100mg/month given i.v.	0.9202186824222444
with cumulative doses from 40-940mg.	0.6705576329048425
All patients were followed-up prospectively for 24-36 months after initiation of therapy.	1.0073190777612095
The evaluations included a 48 swollen and tender joint count, ESR, CRP, RF, ANA, ENA, and safety parameters at 6 month intervals.	0.8143904293382958
In addition, pharmacokinetics, TNF, and anti-TNFR55-IgG1 antibody levels were available after the first and third injection.	1.0516872390645202
Results: Data from 80 patients are available representing an experience of more than 170 patient years;  11 patients are still being treated.	1.2679796305744269
Predominant reasons for treatment withdrawal were restrictions in treatment protocol.	0.7814427412510583
Six patients died  (1 during treatment, 5 in the post-treatment follow-up).	1.331629636421894
All deaths were related to preexisting cardiovascular disease except one post-surgery septic arthritis 6 months after the last dosing (during vacation in another country).	0.9315663081106496
Anti-TNFR55-IgG1 antibodies correlated with a decrease in drug half-time.	0.6911932827886763
Shifts in the TNFR55-IgG1 glycosylation pattern affected pharmacokinetics and efficacy.	0.6967302297563774
A lupus nephritis occurred 18 months after the last dosing in one patient with erosive RA (ANA and dsDNS positive already before TNFR55-IgG1 initiation).	0.9161830239735587
Continued treatment for 3 years in 11 patients resulted in an 81% reduction in swollen joint count, less morning stiffness, less pain, and a reduction in steroids.	1.2346379813300017
Conclusion: Treatment with TNFR55-IgG1 is safe and efficacious over the long-term in patients with severe refractory RA.	1.14016390719189
For both VFR and as IFR flight, visual assessment is the major source of information for the pilot.	1.006407123708777
The new possibilities for change of refraction by means of corneal refractive surgery have led to an increasing demand from pilots for these new methods.	0.9521297991737204
Can these methods successfully be applied for aviation purposes?	0.7840193372638324
The valid regulations for medical standards of pilots, as well as the future international regulations such as JAR and ICAO, are explained in this respect.	1.053760723831019
A report is given on the work of the Advisory Board of the German Federal Government Air Traffic Authority and on the cases treated so far and their outcome, and recommendations are expressed.	1.0961200185142908
Concerning the legal situation and clinical experience, advice for pilots, aviation medical examiners and ophthalmologists is given.	0.7793306558741645
Persistent remnants of the caudal müllerian ducts can manifest in several forms and are often associated with other urogenital disorders, especially hypospadias.	1.033514125306843
Inadequate activity of the müllerian inhibiting factor, in addition to fetal testosterone deficiency, is responsible for this syndrome.	1.1106064982729245
The etiology, diagnosis and management of müllerian duct remnants are discussed.	0.7850111400332089
A complex case of penile-scrotal hypospadia, hypoplastic prostate gland, testicular ectopia and retrovesical cyst is presented.	0.775471184922298
The official German guidelines for prevention of nosocomial pneumonia were published by the Bundesgesundheitsamt, now called Robert-Koch-Institut, twelve years ago.	0.6895470322781384
The recently published official "guidelines for prevention of nosocomial pneumonia" of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are categorized according to scientific evidence.	0.6625400416433402
The American guidelines are very detailed and differ in some aspects from the official German guidelines.	0.5631740160273515
The purpose of the present paper is to inform the German anaesthesiologist about the official CDC guidelines and to provide a renewed background for the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia.	0.9110920328931436
At present, the importation into Germany of life-threatening and highly contagious diseases such as pneumonic plague and Ebola is unlikely, but cannot be ruled out.	0.9000586276773199
In spite of the extreme rarity of these diseases, guidelines are necessary to prevent the spread of these agents in case of their importation.	1.1457402080902919
In Germany, marked regional differences exist with respect to the development of emergency regulations and the availability of specialized centers for diagnostics and therapy.	0.9957917841965932
A federal framework is missing.	0.4992897839232073
A concept is presented here in which the capacity to respond is substantially augmented with limited additional cost through inter-regional cooperation using existing infrastructure and federally standardized procedures.	0.8856719861724666
The therapeutic effect and the side effects of fumaric acid derivatives used in treatment of psoriasis vulgaris have been subjects of controversy for more than 30 years.	1.0750900175599223
A total of 83 patients with severe psoriasis vulgaris were investigated in as ingle-centre, long-term open (12 months) clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of the fumaric acid ester preparations Fumaderm initial and Fumaderm.	1.133470356572032
The antipsoriatic effect of the fumaric acid derivatives was clear, with a mean reduction of 76% in PASI.	1.2133790329842793
Adverse events in were noted in 62% of the patients (mainly flushing and gastrointestinal complaints).	0.9423390087773842
These were dose-dependent and decreased in frequency in the course of the study.	1.1460181274310037
No severe adverse events occurred.	0.555649746301062
We believe that of fumaric acid derivatives are indicated in cases of severe therapy-resistant psoriasis to and can be used even for long-term application.	1.0433647751690733
Background: Because retinal necrosis syndrome seldom occurs, we present our results of silicone oil tamponade for associated retinal detachment.	1.383262410861301
The eyelids are the site of many different pathological conditions.	0.9364030041426195
Swelling - often oedematous - is a frequent symptom.	1.5575591555272468
This publication deals with the pathophysiological and anatomical basis of eyelid swelling and mainly provides a practical approach for differential diagnosis with the help of flow and short characterisations of possible causes.	0.9945825990575734
The subjective complaints of the patient charts (pain, pruritus) are shown to be important criteria for orientation.	1.271804556756645
Special interest is focussed on allergic diseases and atrophic conditions as causes of eyelid swelling.	0.7362217165157154
A 74-year-old man suffered from symptoms of a left upper lobe pneumonia.	1.101700079433465
Additional retrosternal masses were proved.	0.45717499875674394
Progression in the left upper lobe occurred in spite of antibiotic therapy; infiltrations of the right lower lobe were seen.	1.126176423649583
No germs could be identified.	0.5019157561305375
Bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy showed no pathological findings.	0.560103912937593
His general health became worse, and the patient died under the clinical diagnosis of "wandering pneumonia" with finally suspicion of fulminant pulmonary artery embolism.	1.2465673083325366
Autopsy findings revealed an advanced stage of pulmonary artery sarcoma with myocardial infiltration and metastases in both kidneys and thyroid gland.	0.9113787660892414
General manifestation of pulmonary artery sarcoma usually are symptoms similar to those caused by pulmonary artery embolism with obstruction of pulmonary arterial flow.	0.9845039491188602
The unusual constellation of clinical findings similar to colliquating pneumonia results in secondary infection due to tumorous pulmonary infarction.	0.7938912725014309
The difficulties in diagnosis by biopsy are caused by primary intravascular growth of the neoplasms.	0.9728216749464149
Therefore early diagnosis in an operable tumor stage by means of CT, MR, and angiography is very important.	1.129691209893659
Definition of the problem: Is it the brain that makes a human being a person?	0.898737529579861
This anthropological question has been raised because of the findings of modern human brain research, and there are severe ethical consequences anew: If the appropriate anthropological answer is yes, then all invasive research would be problematic, because one would touch the basis of human essence.	1.195610178279244
The problem is that the two major philosophical paradigms that offer an answer to the anthropological question, dualism and monism, have opposing concepts.	1.0510010734880082
Arguments: This paper argues that the error of these two paradigms is that they understand the human body and the human mind as 'res' - as things.	1.3010409745691451
The explanation of the human being as an interactive unit of body and mind is impossible in both paradigms.	0.9939221330365207
A third anthropological view that tries to make that understandable is the anthropology of the Hebrew Bible.	0.7503917649490213
It does assume the category 'thing' while speaking about humans, it presumes the category 'aspect'.	0.9082725869087604
There is no Hebrew word for 'mind' in contrast to 'body' or vice versa.	0.9576276223687491
The biblical language only knows terms for the unity of human beings seen under a certain aspect.	0.8535337569112852
Conclusion: Here, the body and thus the brain are important and necessary condition for human essence, but this is not a sufficient explanation for the human personality.	1.3595069998783857
Invasive research on the human brain is here neither generally forbidden nor tolerated - one has to demonstrate in every single case whether the planned operation touches regions that are crucial for the personality of the human subject.	1.1135423221740324
Introduction: In recent studies we identified two morphological phenomena in the facial nucleus of the brainstem that play an important role in the recovery of facial movement: hyperinnervation and misdirected reinnervation.	1.1022124056911495
While the hyperinnervation could easily be quantified by cell counting, the extent of misdirected reinnervation could not be estimated accurately.	0.8987252758437626
In the present study we developed a method for accurate quantification of this misdirected reinnervation.	1.0838099030384647
A 50 year old female patient received anaesthesia of the arm by the vertical infraclavicular blockade of the plexus brachialis (VIP).	1.0423778205970162
Postoperatively an ipsilateral pneumothorax occured complicated by pleural effusion and a contralateral bronchopneumonia, which resolved completely after treatment.	0.9458475867935551
The blockade of the plexus was performed correctly, failures in determining the correct point of needle insertion could be excluded.	0.9276642356253623
Therefore a pneumothorax has to be regarded as a specific complication of the VIP, which might occur despite correct technique, and requires that the patient be informed of this eventuality.	1.1864043099542447
Nevertheless, the VIP is an important method due to its high success rate concerning blockade of the musculocutaneous nerve and tolerance of tourniquet.	1.1231806874228132
The risk of a pneumothorax is about 0.2 to 0.7%.	1.0935477891724399
The routine application of ultrasound in pregnancy has had an important impact on perinatal medicine.	0.9179761294690086
New trends in perinatal medicine, aiming at more individual and self-determined pregnancy and delivery, are realizable because of the safety provided by ultrasound.	0.9282260090215566
Often prenatal ultrasound is regarded as only being able to detect fetal malformations, but ultrasound provides many more benefits for a safe pregnancy: early detection of fetal viability; intrauterine localization of the pregnancy; exact determination of the gestational age in early pregnancy; later in pregnancy, confirmation of appropriate fetal growth, position and localization of placenta site.	1.016969769057472
In addition, the development of close mother-child bonding by visualizing the fetus could be of positive impact.	0.9218105084742411
These aspects are contributions of ultrasound to a gentle and safe pregnancy and delivery for mother and child.	0.9124169032643387
For routine evaluation of ureteropelvic junction obstruction in children, sonography, voiding cystogram, IV pyelogram and a renal scan in combination with administration of furosemide are available.	0.9419103395474027
Furthermore, often preoperative antegrade or retrograde ureteropyelography is performed.	1.2364832137575348
However, the significance of retrograde ureteropyelography in the world literature remains controversial.	1.0188438452718847
Therefore, we reviewed the records of 41 children who underwent a pyeloplasty in our department.	1.2134968591479542
In 9 children the ureter was visualized by IV pyelogram, voiding cystogram or antegrade ureteropyelography; a retrograde examination of the ureter was performed in 21 children before pyeloplasty in the OR.	0.9637310827572816
In 11 children the ureter was not visualized preoperatively.	0.5513230357379463
Retrograde ureterography neither gave additional information in any patient nor did it change the operative technique.	0.9516876364142047
In the children where the ureter was not visualized preoperatively, no ureteric abnormality was found in association with ureteropelvic junction obstruction.	0.9332653905243182
Hence, we conclude that retrograde ureteropyelography before pyeloplasty in children is not necessary, provided that sonography does not show ureteral dilatation.	1.1856218463344939
We report on a patient with multicentric juvenile xanthogranuloma, whose unusual clinical and histological pattern initially obscured the diagnosis.	1.019370619204248
Spontaneous remission of the tumour, which has now been maintained for over 2 years, the change from the primary monomorphological fibrocytic appearance to a polymorphological histiocytic picture with multiple fat-storing giant cells, and the lacking demonstration of specific cell organelles finally allowed the nature of the disease to the definitely diagnosed.	1.1747530344544803
In children with horseshoe kidneys Wilms' tumors can be observed 2 to 8-times more often.	0.9990914411401841
Wilms' tumors are malignant mixed tissue tumors that seldom show large parts of fatty tissue.	0.8040969291420383
We report about a 28-month-old girl with an unusual Wilms' tumor in a horseshoe kidney which according to radiological criteria could have been a teratoma because of its large lipomatous part with internal calcifications.	1.0672736701674472
The radiological characteristics of these differential diagnoses are presented in different cross-section imagings.	0.9683438400300725
Both differential diagnostic considerations correlated with the histologic diagnosis of a teratoid Wilms'tumor.	1.0084124896477884
Gene therapy in orthopedic surgery is a new technic based on the idea of biological tissue healing.	1.0401506817444748
External gene segments are transferred to cells that overexpress growth factors locally to achieve this effect.	0.8865831729022742
The influence of growth factors on fracture healing is very well documented in the literature.	0.9788816524574374
Experimental data demonstrate that defect healing in bone can be accelerated by the application of different cytokines in vivo.	0.8805499739363201
Gene transfer is a promising, new technic of in situ tissue engineering that will enter clinics within the next decade.	1.1040535694106446
Biomechanical investigations of the mandible are difficult to perform due to a variety of conditions involved.	0.9959636063597063
For the appropriate reconstruction of biomechanical properties, a geometrically correct body model has to be established which fits to complex in vivo conditions.	1.0803792966033903
The aim of our study was to evaluate the use of finite-element models (FEM) for the assessment of mandibular deformation under mechanical loading.	0.9263227755271941
Explanted human mandibles (n = 5) were investigated by strain gauges to determine the individual strain distribution under mechanical loading.	1.1211314109105688
FEM analysis based on a computed tomograph (CT) was performed and the results were matched with the test data.	1.1913452961964235
Our study demonstrates only minor interindividual differences in the strain distribution for each load studied.	0.8683684059964708
The mechanical response in terms of deformation was found to depend mainly on gross geometrical properties and to a minor extent on the various other variables.	1.045390122995342
At all positions the maximum principal strain was tensile, the minimum principal strain was compressive, and the absolute strain values were correlated with the magnitude of the applied force.	1.1199294517014384
CT-based FEM analysis revealed the utility of mathematical models to approximate simulated data our experimental results.	0.8302714517293611
Hence, FEM analysis is a non-invasive tool in the prediction of biomechanical behaviour of individual mandibles and therefore may help in trauma reconstruction and treatment planning.	1.051434042279973
Acrodysostosis is a rare syndrome characterized by growth retardation and peripheral dysostosis.	1.035344715580925
70% of affected patients exhibit mental retardation.	1.0870454755866235
Inheritance occurs in an autosomal-dominant pattern.	0.7379554912117724
The genetic defect is not known.	0.782086754149916
Therapeutic strategies in the treatment of pancreatic carcinoma are based on the high number of non-resectable cancers, the high relative radioresistance and the high distant metastases rate.	1.1097035949232004
Even in curatively resected carcinomas, a locally effective treatment modality is needed because of the risk of microscopical residual disease in the peripancreatic tissue.	0.8646136605743253
The efficacy of radiotherapy is dose dependent.	0.6964894593455865
Based on an analysis of published data a dose of more than 50 Gy is recommended, resulting in a high morbidity rate with external beam radiotherapy alone.	1.0712147034184911
The use of intraoperative radiotherapy allows locally restricted dose escalation without increased perioperative morbidity.	0.8608434667068624
In adjuvant and in primary treatment, local tumor contol was improved (70-90 %).	1.0116964828102943
With palliative intent, pain relief was obtained rapidly in over 60 % of patients and led to improved patient performance.	1.2593600159616196
As a result of the high distant metastases rate, even in curatively resected carcinomas, the overall prognosis could not be significantly improved.	1.143914237990675
Further dose escalation is limited by the increasing incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (20-30 %).	0.8514459295469153
Malignant tumors of the head and neck region are amongst the six most often occurring tumors of the body.	0.9257952040418207
They can be associated with the different anatomical compartments as well as different histologic types.	1.0954589119194709
The way of tumor spread of these malignancies depends on their histologic type and on the region.	1.006779388392328
These compartments can be separated into the nasopharynx, the oropharynx, and the hypopharynx.	1.2832247690198675
Most of the malignant tumors belong to the squamous cell carcinomas, other histologic types are depicted less frequently.	1.0065394015120734
The histologic types of the other groups which are seen more often comprise of lymphomas and adenoidcystic carcinomas.	1.020101693417075
The undifferentiated carcinoma of the nasopharynx is supposed to be a special type of tumor.	1.0804863105049334
The malignant tumors of the pharynx can also involve all three compartments.	0.9061468869118718
Beside these tumors, malignancies of mesenchymal origin can also be delineated.	0.7377210316983682
While there are quite a number of reports on vascular injuries complicating hip arthropasty by acetabular component screw fixation, retractor tip pressure or extruding bone cement, the incidence of deep femoral vessel injuries in operative fixation of proximal femoral fractures is comparatively seldom described.	0.9883364391891158
We report on two patients with per- and subtrochanteric femoral fractures who sustained injuries of deep femoral artery branches during the implantation of a dynamic hip screw (DHS) and a dynamic condylar screw (DCS), which resulted in a massive thigh hematoma and a fist-size pseudoaneurysm respectively and necessitated surgical intervention in either case.	1.120865778763633
We blame these vascular injuries on the pressure of Hohmann retractors exposing the femoral bone or on the drilling of boreholes for plate attachement.	0.8703888477878294
After discussing various operative procedures, we conclude that intramedullar implants are safer than plates with regard to potential vascular complications.	1.0143853593405148
Cleft lip and palates (CLP) are caused by a variety of factors.	0.8335396342600927
Ionizing radiation is only one of these factors.	1.0903026952549093
The meltdown of the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl on April 26, 1986, and the subsequent radioactive fallout did not cause any acute radiation sickness in Germany.	1.0480758803925123
Nevertheless, in West Berlin a significant increase of trisomy-21 cases was reported in births 9 months after the Chernobyl reactor accident.	1.1292122421079158
In our study we analyzed the influence of the radioactive fallout after the Chernobyl disaster on the rate and regional distribution of CLP newborns in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR).	1.0762587093968168
In contrast to the Federal Republic of Germany an ongoing malformation register for CLP newborns had existed in the former GDR since 4 July 1967.	0.9991338123686153
Environmental data were collected from national and international environmental authorities and atomic energy agencies.	0.8403136214634114
Population statistics were taken from the statistical yearbook of the former GDR.	0.8077007743858535
During a 10-year period from 1980 to 1989, the average number of CLP newborns in the GDR was 1.88 per 1,000 live births.	1.1816920817865142
A significant prevalence increase was recorded in 1983, 1987 und 1988.	0.874011266058308
In comparison to the mean rate in the period from 1980 until 1986, 1987 demonstrated an increase of 9.4%.	1.1114011580667555
Regional prevalence increases were seen in the three northern districts of Schwerin, Rostock and Neubrandenburg, where the radioactivity measurements in general showed higher levels of the radionuclides caesium-137 und strontium-90 than in other districts.	0.9789473236939151
Owing to the comprehensive malformation register for CLP patients in the GDR, this is the first study for Germany, analyzing the CLP rate before and after the fallout in Chernobyl.	1.1148862744293297
The results support the allegation of the influence of radiation-induced increase of CLP newborns after the Chernobyl reactor accident.	0.816415994293089
The median survival time for patients with disseminated malignant melanoma is 5-7 months; it is still not really known whether therapeutic measures prolong survival.	1.1945618096421007
The aim of the present investigation was to identify patients with prolonged survival in stage IV disease and to analyse the possible impact of therapy on the course of the disease.	1.0710544570128575
in the Department of Dermatology, Benjamin Franklin University Medical Centre at the Free University of Berlin, 263 patients with were diagnosed as having stage IV melanoma and enrolled in a computer-based registry between 1970 and 1993.	0.8586436278090703
In 89 cases systemic medical mentous treatment was given and 111 patients underwent surgery and/or radiation therapy.	0.8652082667747232
There were 48 patients who received both systemic and local therapy.	0.9093216507804257
On the other hand, 111 patients received no treatment.	0.6767410920945954
Twenty two patients were identified survived longer than 24 months (median survival time 33 months).	1.122477148013441
None of the patients who had received no treatment survived for 2 years or longer.	1.2725150850088094
The 22 patients with prolonged survival were treated by multimodality included 16 who had received both systemic treatment and surgery and/or radiation, while 3 had had only systemic drug therapy and another 3, only local treatment.	1.175781639264756
Twelve of the 22 patients became tumour free after their initial surgery or radiation.	0.9303249527848992
Active therapy in disseminated melanoma with reduction of tumour mass by surgery and radiation and with systemic medical treatment may lead to prolonged survival in a considerable percentage of patients.	1.0234666166345545
Background: The use of intravenous heparin is essential for the treatment of unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction.	1.1499786020138787
A significant rebound of thrombin generation within 6 to 10 hours after termination of heparin infusion has been reported.	0.9115881756705069
This time window is clinically critical as the incidence of recurrent ischemia peaks in this period.	0.8802733379641247
It has therefore been recommended to gradually taper heparin infusion continously rather than to discontinue it abruptly.	0.8704460653721777
However, it is not known which dosing procedure is useful and whether it definitly reduces thrombin rebound.	1.1804431168227094
The use of porcine skin as a biomedical model for the human integument is discussed with reference to the literature.	1.008910197806441
The epidermis and dermis can be used as a model as there are clear structural, functional and biochemical similarities with human skin layers.	1.0468287234827487
The actual utilization of porcine skin in dermatological research is reviewed.	0.7744460887657642
Practical difficulties are emphasized: in particular, the conditions required for use of porcine skin in experimental research, the most suitable breeds, and restrictions on biological interpretation of the results.	1.2384033493839748
Laparoscopic procedures have attained increasing importance in the diagnosis and therapy of carcinoma of the cervix in recent years (Table 1) [34].	1.2830152866699234
Laparoscopic pelvic and para-aortal lymphadenectomies are therefore performed to assess the operability of carcinoma of the cervix and for its staging.	0.9837053825760701
In the case of primarily operable tumours, paraortal and pelvic lymphadenectomy is carried out by a laparoscopic procedure, and when the lymph nodes are negative nodes and there is no intra-abdominal metastasis the lymphadenectomy is combined with laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy.	1.0785860034440085
If laparoscopy discloses positive lymph nodes, debulking can be carried out and the patient can be referred for radiotherapy.	0.9749881300022302
In addition, laparoscopic procedures, even in combination with radical cervicectomy for early invasive carcinoma of the cervix, can mean conservation of the patient's fertility.	1.2580615264521668
In the case of primarily inoperable tumours laparoscopy can be used to assess the lymph node status and the intra-abdominal tumour spread and to classify the patient's condition as potentially secondarily operable or inoperable.	1.1705454479425308
In addition, in the case of primarily undertreated patients whose carcinoma of the cervix has been diagnosed incidentally in preparations of tissue examined following hysterectomy, posttreatment in the form of laparoscopic lymphadenectomy and laparoscopically assisted colpectomy can be performed.	1.081523804505836
The efficacy of buprenorphine in opioid dependent patients (n=20) was compared to methadone maintained subjects (n=20) in a randomized comparison trial.	1.1844891139443736
Sublingual application of buprenorphine as an alternative synthetical opioid is being compared to methadone during a 24 week study period.	0.9799700966797114
A trend (p=0.06) could be found in the retention rate of investigated patients being maintained on a mean dosage of 63 mg oral applicable methadone (racemat of L- and D-methadone) in comparison to the group on a mean dosage of 7,3 mg buprenorphine (sublingual tablets).	1.046826229475751
The dropout-rate of 11 subjects at the end of the study in the buprenorphine group was higher when compared to the dropout-rate of 5 in the methadone group.	1.015504788043965
There was no significant difference between the two groups over the treatment period in respect to additional consumption of opiates, benzodiazepines and cocaine as evaluated through urine toxicology.	0.9389674265296675
The result in regard to compliance over the study period demonstrates that methadone appears to be the more successful oral opioid (p=0,04).	1.1612697323917833
Nevertheless, efficacy of buprenorphine in maintenance could be demonstrated in the remaining subjects, and further studies with higher daily doses and a higher number of subjects have to be performed.	1.3276693991397834
In patients with pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma, surgery is a technically difficult procedure.	0.9938183827390017
Whereas those rare forms of localized pleural mesotheliomy are being detected incidentally and can be cured by complete resection, most patients with diffuse malignant mesothelioma present with an advanced stage of disease.	0.9915295648571765
Most of these patients survive less than 12 months irrespective of the treatment modality.	1.2278643898616657
For diffuse pleural mesothelioma, some favorable prognostic factors were identified: IMIG (International Mesothelioma Interest Group), stages I and II, epithelial type, age under 50, female gender.	1.0914125721751644
In IMIG stages I and II, extended pleuropneumonectomy followed by chemo- and/or radiotherapy is recommended.	0.8122977673959259
For this subset of patients, a median survival time of between 20 and 30 months is reported.	1.0512926661636421
Pleurectomy and decortication are recommended as palliative surgical strategies against pleural effusion.	0.8064291409822855
In patients with technically inoperable infiltration of the thoracic wall, irradiation is helpful; sometimes partial remission and relief of pain can be achieved by chemotherapy.	0.9657696412729442
Fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG) registers the magnetic field generated by the fetal heart.	0.7945127795116772
In contrast to the fetal elctrocardiogram, fECG permits non-invasive registration of fetal heart activity and documentation of all parts of the PQRST-wave-forms from the second trimenon onwards.	1.0602615986493733
This facilitates the determination of cardiac time intervals and establishment of reference values for different stages of pregnancy.	0.9167764230480104
We examined 53 women in 104 recordings from the 10th week of gestation onwards (1 to 10 recordings per individual).	1.000652791173547
The fMCG (37 magnetic channels, sampling rate 1024 Hz, bandwidth 1-200Hz) was recorded non-invasively over the mother's abdomen in a magnetically shielded room.	0.9875176702934035
Registration of fetal heart beats was generally successful from the 20/21th week of gestation onwards.	0.886556255096647
In a few cases, fetal heart beats could be registered as early as in the 16th week.	1.093724312991744
Cardiac time intervals and amplitudes of fMCG increased concordantly with fetal growth.	0.6667835581381791
Mean P wave duration increased from 31 to 49 ms (p < 0.05), PQ interval from 95 to 107 ms (n. s.) and QRS duration from 36 to 52 ms (p < 0.01).	0.8832955057030649
The mean amplitudes of the P and R waves also increased.	0.7738984721336455
To demonstrate imaging findings in inflammatory diseases of the pharynx and possible complications.	0.9400116370987276
The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyse the complications of our arthroscopic procedures at the ankle joint.	1.1134098133818109
In all patients we evaluated the treatment protocols and in 111 patients (79,3%) we also evaluated the clinical and radiologic results.	1.3310023022490836
All in all we have found complications in 14 patients.	0.8323187401861976
In 4 cases we have seen a delayed wound healing, in 2 cases a superficial infection, in 3 cases a deep infection, in 3 cases a neural damage and in 2 cases a phlebothrombosis.	1.2972790831848136
Our study show, that the complication rate could be minimized by detailed knowledge of the anatomy, exact preoperative diagnostic and planing of the operation and careful preparation of the portals.	1.1733819643174512
The use of a laser also shows a tendency to a lower complication rate.	1.0752280598652688
Airbag inflation is associated with a loud noise.	0.7471887536048631
This very short noise has a peak amplitude of 170 dB sound pressure level and can make otologic injuries.	0.8662738382591131
We report a case of acoustic trauma after airbag inflation.	0.8245331097914229
The 24-year-old man has hearing loss both side in the 3000- to 6000-Hz range and in the deep-frequency.	1.1570824626369491
The possibility of acoustic trauma from airbag noise are probably much more common and need more attention in the clinic.	0.9130292923420305
The incidence of primary malignant neoplasms of the pleura, the pericardium and the peritoneum in Germany has been rising since about the mid-1980 s. A continuing rise is expected until about 2020, predominantly due to the peak of asbestos processing in Germany between 1965 and 1980.	1.1147987228280982
About 90 % of the mesotheliomas stored in the files of the German Mesothelioma Registry in Bochum are asbestos related and therefore possibly due to occupational exposure that may be compensated by the professional associations.	1.064479860949104
More than 500 mesotheliomas annually can be diagnosed in the German Mesothelioma Registry.	1.1035007220963988
In this first part of the series on mesotheliomas, current concepts on etiology and pathogenesis as well as diagnostic procedures and standards are discussed.	1.0796255993090549
At the present, specific chromosomal or genetic defects that constantly give rise to a mesothelioma are not known.	1.008638764699915
The initiation and progression of malignant mesotheliomas is a highly complex mechanism that is based on individual genetic alterations.	0.9716101410247155
A reliable diagnosis is the basis for therapeutic, prognostic and medicolegal conseques; in general, it can be achieved by thoracoscopic inspection with selected biopsy.	1.1957309674160974
Surgery may gain a more important role in the therapy of malignant tumors of serosal membranes not only in palliative, but also in potential curative approaches if the diagnosis can be made at earlier tumor stages.	1.2124104287538013
Acute gastrointestinal bleeding is a life threatening disease with a mortality rate of 10%.	1.1491841162150316
Upper gastrointestinal bleeding occurs more frequent (85%) and more severe compared to lower gastrointestinal bleeding.	1.0942114381437178
The medical history may be helpful in the diagnosis of the bleeding source.	1.180756199743825
Prognosis and mortality are dependent on intensity of bleeding, reflected by clinical signs such as shock, hemoglobin level, transfused blood units, hematemesis, presence of comorbidity and age of the patient.	0.9413939590223177
Furthermore rebleeding is associated with an increased mortality.	1.0315015990730514
Therefore one major goal in the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding is to avoid rebleeding.	0.9618512938986459
Joints are innervated by nociceptive nerve fibres (nociceptors), which are only activated by tissue-damaging stimuli.	1.1184379629523058
This activation causes pain in conscious humans.	0.6445127937744735
The sensory terminals of many nociceptors in the tissue are sensitized by inflammatory processes.	0.8582094930216854
Under these conditions, normally innocuous and non-painful stimuli are sufficient to activate nociceptors and to elicit pain.	0.8138769802504726
The effect of inflammatory mediators such as bradykinin and prostaglandins is important for the process of sensitization.	0.8214104546199004
In addition to their sensory function, many nociceptors have an efferent function.	1.1125828778542952
They evoke a neurogenic inflammation by the release of neuropeptides such as substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide into the tissue.	0.8070155640223278
The efferent function of nociceptors contributes to the generation of inflammatory lesions of the tissue.	0.7748694375196885
Autolyzed, antigen-extracted, allogeneic bone (AAA bone) is prepared from cortical bones of human organ donors.	0.8272372617244366
AAA bone possesses osteoinductive properties as it delivers BMPs from its bone matrix.	0.6929215851247631
Within a prospective study, 37 cranial defects were reconstructed using AAA bone implants over a period of more than 7 years.	1.0326392088542118
The patients were followed-up at standardized intervals.	0.9617474492640771
Roentgenographic assessments and bone scintigraphies revealed osseous integration and remodelling of the AAA bone implants.	0.7411982231973282
In one quarter of the cases re-entry was performed 10 to 18 months after the cranioplasty (removal of osteosynthesis material, recurrence of tumor).	1.0274287825455461
All nine AAA bone reconstructions showed bleeding surfaces and bony integrations.	0.6864083774947537
A bone biopsy was taken from the center of one of these AAA bone implants and this showed new bone formation originating from the surface of the implant.	1.0463185543022735
In one case an AAA bone implant was lost due to infection.	0.8939503725378534
This is noteworthy as in approximately one third of the cases the bone implants were in direct contact with the frontal sinus.	1.1176021144960422
The clinical results clearly emphasize the therapeutical benefit of AAA bone for cranioplasties.	0.8713270136310214
Large AAA bone chips from human skull bones facilitate the reconstruction of the skull's convexity, especially when sterolithography-based operation planning is performed.	1.0193232353816635
Saphenous vein harvesting remains a 20 % source of morbidity in patients who require lower extremity bypass or coronary artery bypass grafting.	1.124240148833209
In an attempt to reduce the complications associated with this procedure, minimally invasive video-assisted vein harvesting is propagated.	0.9179486442252923
The technique uses currently available endoscopic equipment with mechanical retraction to dissect the great saphenous vein with two limited incisions.	0.7973120403184262
The dissection is visualized on the video monitor to isolate and control side branches by clips.	0.7913681876693008
The vein is removed for reverse arterial bypass grafting or dissection is completed for an in situ bypass procedure.	0.9619350782804638
Initial experience with ten patients undergoing peripheral bypass procedures showed a mean vein-preparation time of 60 min.	0.9247158494783875
Two of seven in situ bypass procedures were complicated by side branch damage controlled through longer skin incision.	0.8582533621743312
After a mean follow-up of 12 months, all bypasses are patent.	1.1190115804748966
Taking our own experience as well as that reported in the literature into consideration, aspects of cost-effectiveness are discussed.	1.1376228909869603
Obstructions of the nasolacrimal duct occur frequently (70%) in term newborns and are symptomatic in 6%.	1.096631688975514
The reason is an incomplete canalization and differentiation of the lacrimal duct during the fetal period.	1.0075246188837286
A persisting membran between the duct and the nasal cavity at the level of the valve of Hasner in combination with a proximal valvelike obstruction at the junction of the lacrimal canal and sac may cause a dacryocystocele by fluid accumulation.	0.9999566949705857
We describe a term newborn with a bilateral dacryocystocele and respiratory distress.	0.9676766177833381
The recognition of a medical discipline on a European level as an independent specialty depends on its registration in the medical directives of the European Union.	1.071061082844074
With supreme effort, the oral and maxillofacial surgeons of the EU reached this goal in 1989.	1.110054313408485
The UEMS - Section of Stomatology and Oromaxillofacial Surgery - became the forum for discussion of the relevant problems with representatives of the member states and officials of the European Commission.	1.0294296483364196
Thanks to its activities, oral and maxillofacial surgery is now recognized as an independent specialty with about 3800 specialists in 11 European countries.	0.9797000479921064
A biatrial pacemaker was inserted in a 68-year-old female with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter refractory to antiarrhythmic drugs based on a sick-sinus-syndrome and concomitant interatrial conduction delay.	1.0459086808239146
One electrode positioned in the right atrium and another electrode located in the coronary sinus were connected to a dual-chamber pacemaker.	0.9995126955484901
The electrode in the right atrium was connected to the atrial channel, the electrode in the coronary sinus to the ventricular channel.	1.141386485625797
The pacemaker was programmed in DDD-mode with an AV-delay of 30 ms.	0.879275783320043
Under a chronic antiarrhythmic medication with 160 mg sotalol per day there was no evidence for recurrent episodes of atrial tachyarrhythmias in the patient's history, 24-h-Holter-ECG, nor in the memory of the pacemaker during a follow-up of 8 months.	1.1671564783257167
The AB0 blood types, first discovered by Karl Landsteiner in 1901, can be genotyped with the PCR method of Lee and Chang [6].	0.8488223995833433
Using two primer pairs, allele-specific sequences can be amplified and, after digestion with restriction endonucleases, visualized by silver staining on a polyacrylamide gel.	0.9163561837672641
In a southwest German population the allele frequencies were: Allele A = 0.2704, allele B = 0.0741 and allele 0 = 0.6556.	0.9550733966974149
With the method of Lee and Chang [6] only the nucleotide positions 261 and 703 are considered so that out of 280 individuals 10 (3.57%) showed differences between the AB0 genotype and phenotype, because it was not possible to differentiate between A and 02 alleles.	1.1515828471332912
Based on the one experience and the information that is available in the literature indications for ankle arthroscopy are given, surgical equipment, patient placement and surgical technique of different procedures are described.	1.3228605787030607
Finally the results and possible complications are presented.	1.06863646964578
Removal of loose bodies as well as synovectomies in case of an acute infection or rheumatoid arthritis are good indication.	1.0105183878901367
Arthroscopic treatment of anterior pathology in the athletic ankle need a thorough diagnostic work-up; the results of the treatment do not always meet the expectations of this especially demanding population.	1.0610400501488306
Cartilage treatment is technically possible, however, long term results are still missing.	1.247949193543554
This is also true for the treatment on osteochondritis dissecans.	1.2047061367746503
In patients with degenerative joint disease arthroscopic debridement can only lead to a temporary benefit.	0.9407296561642383
Arthroscopic assisted arthrodeses (AAA) is technically demanding, but can serve as an excellent alternative to conventional open techniques.	1.23007442162693
The complication rate in ankle arthroscopy is high compared to other joints, which is especially true for neurologic complications and postoperative infections.	1.180277736928712
This should be addressed when performing the informed consent.	0.8157211856981401
Recent prospective randomised trials dealed with the optimal extent of surgical resection as well as with preoperative therapy modalities in pancreatic, rectal and breast cancer.	1.0416223584714304
In pancreatic cancer extended lymphadenectomy did not improve overall survival.	0.7902089349280318
Total mesorectal excision remarkably changed surgery for rectal cancer.	0.6446056141187693
Rate of local recurrence of rectal cancer could be significantly reduced by preoperative irradiation.	0.9817383781187239
In advanced rectal cancers curative resection and sphincter preservation seems possible due to multimodal preoperative therapy.	0.757253156126983
It has been demonstrated that in appropriate cases breastpreserving resection is comparable to mastectomy with respect to overall survival.	1.013627023928647
Up to now it is not quite clear if sentinel node sampling is equivalent to routine lymphadenectomy.	0.8640210063226186
Following neoadjuvant chemotherapy breastpreservation rate is significantly higher, but survival is not significantly increased.	1.0989557242203385
Introduction and Methods: A 0.5 T open-configuration MR system allows free access to the patient via a 58-cm-wide opening on both sides of the machine.	1.1721625827658404
A newly developed system for needle guidance enables the examiner to perform biopsies in combination with real-time imaging and to position laser fibers in the human body.	0.9836631650039079
For imaging, a 2D gradient echo sequence is used (TR 19 ms, TE 9 ms, flip angle 30  °, FOV 24 x 24 cm, slice thickness 10 mm matrix 256 x 128).	0.9029985804567718
The acquired images are displayed on two LCD screens localized within the MR system, thus allowing an interactive needle guidance.	0.9573339092681554
This procedure is illustrated by a case report.	0.8825357895991686
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are established drugs for the treatment of patients with heart failure and hypertension.	0.912581861816145
There is mounting evidence to suggest that ACE inhibitors may be used for different indications as well.	0.8911369512779354
The rational for the use of ACE inhibitors is to block the vasoconstrictive effects mediated by angiotensin II.	0.8495774384542658
The hemodynamic profile of ACE inhibitors is modified by additional effects such as interference with the degredation of bradykinin and accumulation of prostaglandin and nitric oxide (NO).	0.7543546068078876
Thus ACE inhibitors may be successful in preventing the negative effects of vasoconstriction on regional circulation.	0.9486111469495784
Since vasoconstriction, particularly of the mesenteric vasculature appears to be largely mediated by the renin-angiotensin-axis, ACE inhibitors are assumed to be effective in treating or avoiding gut mucosal hypoperfusion.	1.0171871180493957
The critically ill intensive care patient at risk of developing multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is still a major therapeutic challenge.	1.1488439678106
Intravenous preparations of ACE inhibitors may broaden our therapeutic armamentarium for these patients.	0.815346168995209
However, several questions about the exact mechanisms of ACE inhibitors, such as the ideal substance and the optimal dose, are still open.	1.3259919982230248
Moreover, further work needs to be done to definitely determine whether ACE inhibitors may be helpful to prevent or treat (micro-) circulatory catastrophe in these patients.	1.2268637346731528
The pharmacologic properties of ACE inhibitors provide an exciting stepping stone for future research in this field.	0.8157681892252431
Hypoparathyroidism (HP) results from deficient parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, pseudohypoparathyreoidism (PHP) results form decreased PTH action on its target organs.	0.9349702661103235
Between May 1996 and 1999, a total of 186 endoscopic spinal operations were performed to treat unstable injuries and pathologic fractures.	1.0098216082942537
The operative spinal interventions followed the classic sequence of excision of part of a vertebral body, partial replacement of the vertebral body with bone harvested from the iliac crest, and implantation of a titanium plate to stabilize the part to be fused.	1.0622403024069984
In 62% of these cases we performed primary dorsal straightening with a fixateur interne.	1.2597264772818473
The serious complications were aortic leakage and deep infection in the area of the graft and the implant, each of which occurred in 1 case.	1.1110510893791057
Comparisons with the literature showed approximately the same rate of spinal complications as with open surgery, while the rate of morbidity connected with the surgical approach was reduced to a third in the patient population treated endoscopically, with correspondingly positive implications for the postoperative analgesic requirement and for convalescence.	1.2603597040192651
Various risk scores have been developed for the assessment of operative risk in cardiac surgery.	1.0580809630409027
Although risk stratification has been acknowledged as a useful tool to analyze trends in therapy and changes in patient populations, its relevance in assessing the indication for surgery has been questioned.	1.1132663340921922
It was the goal of this prospective study to compare 6 common risk scores with regard to the predictive value for mortality in individual patients.	1.215346308931291
Between September 1998 and February 1999 all adult patients undergoing heart surgery were prospectively scored according to the following scores: initial Parsonnet, Cleveland Clinic, French, Euro, Pons, and the Ontario Province Risk score.	1.064515303771882
Early lethality was assessed within 30 days postoperatively.	0.7375093149723071
Follow-up was completed in 504 patients.	1.118121973778483
With the exception of the Ontario Province Risk score, lethality in the high risk group was overestimated by all scores, whereas lethality in low to moderate risk groups was underestimated by several scores.	1.07884459661019
Mean scores of surviving and deceased patients showed a broad overlap with high standard deviations.	0.8803557002238613
Preoperative risk scores are effective tools for stratification of patient populations and the analysis of surgical outcome.	0.9246345704763395
With the aid of risk scores, operative risk can be sufficiently predicted for patient populations or subpopulations.	1.0826859617339717
The Euro score best predicted the outcome of our patients.	0.8636992828003041
However, when the indication for surgery is to be determined in an individual patient, risk scores should be only considered as an orientation in the decision process.	1.5157355263200234
Background and objective: A complicated course of erysipelas is not uncommon.	1.0910462738467683
Bullous, haemorrhagic, necrotic and purulent lesions may be encountered.	0.6749300728418574
Today no reliable data exist as to which constitutional factors renders a patient at risk for developing complicated erysipelas though several risk factors, particularly diabetes mellitus, are often suggested.	1.0619467314146993
Based on the analysis of patients with erysipelas at the Department of Dermatology in Graz, factors determining the risk for complicated erysipelas should be identified.	1.1243563164513413
Patients/Methods: In a retrospective case-control study clinical data sheets of 766 in- patients treated at the department were evaluated with respect to the course of the erysipelas and with respect to potential risk factors.	1.2983920933214945
Results: General risk factors for local complications were location at the lower extremities, pre-existing hepatic or renal disease, hyperuricaemia, and diabetes mellitus.	1.2132407226790844
Hepatic and renal disease and - to a lesser extent - diabetes particularly predisposed for bullous and haemorrhagic lesions, while vascular occlusive disease enhanced the risk for ne- crotic lesions.	1.1274079957708938
Conclusions: Location and hepatic and renal disease are the most important risk factors, while diabetes is probably of less significance than previously suggested.	1.2846218702810397
Patients with end-stage liver disease frequently develop combined coagulopathies due to increased procoagulant and fibrinolytic turnover as well as thrombocytopenia.	0.8122413277568212
The onset of clinical symptoms of a haemorrhagic diathesis requires balanced substitution of coagulation factors, since fresh frozen plasma alone does not always maintain a sufficient haemostatic potential in these patients.	0.9843407037715715
This substitution commonly follows standard rules based on the assumption that 0.5 - 1 IU of a coagulation factor or inhibitor concentrate given per kg body weight will increase its endogenous activity by 1%.	1.104591805146368
We set out to investigate the validity of this standard regime in patients with end-stage liver disease scheduled for orthotopic liver transplantation.	0.8693332327373132
Fifty-one adult patients were prospectively studied.	0.8846053860653499
In 37 patients with antithrombin III (AT III) activity <70%, an AT III preparation (Kybernin, Behring, Marburg, Germany) was given preoperatively (mean dose 2616 +/- 207 IU) following standard calculations in order to increase endogenous activity to 80%.	1.1319739395934194
Twenty-seven of the patients had chronic hepatic failure (CHF group) with histologically proven cirrhosis and 10 had acute hepatic failure (AHF group).	1.144617424213499
Blood samples were drawn prior to a 15-min infusion of AT III concentrate and 30 min thereafter.	1.035642780411425
In 14 patients with prothrombin time (PT) <40%, AT III levels had been corrected earlier during the clinical course to achieve activities >70%.	1.2634187538867554
Prothrombin complex (PPSB, Beriplex, Behring, Marburg, Germany) was substituted (mean dose 2304 +/- 289 IU) to increase procoagulant activity to PT >60%.	1.0082402302663012
Blood samples were drawn in the same fashion as in the AT III group.	1.1472891906162481
The amounts of AT III and PPSB concentrates ( AT III, [IU/kg];  PPSB [IU/kg]) required to increase AT III activity and PT, respectively, by 1% were calculated.	1.4101056988407317
Standard calculations for AT III substitution indicated AT III recovery in all 37 patients who received AT III concentrate.	1.0482437325518796
However, there was a statistically significant difference between patients with CLF and ALF.	1.2244281613891457
In patients with CLF,  AT III was found to be 0.8 IU/kg ( +/- 0.1 SEM) and in those with ALF it was 1.5 IU/kg ( +/- 0.1 SEM) (P<0.05,  t-test).	1.2225663136071128
In patients treated with PPSB concentrate,  PPSB was 1.6 U/kg ( +/- 0.2 SEM) for both CLF and ALF groups.	1.2240611115723679
In patients with end stage liver disease standard rules for substitution with AT III-concentrate are adequate only for patients with CLF.	1.0500175056239194
In patients with ALF higher AT III doses are required to achieve the expected effect on endogenous AT III activity.	1.0172126004733575
Procoagulant activity, as reflected by PT, can be increased by 1% when 1.6 IU/kg PPSB concentrate is given.	1.1593226362393718
However, this study shows the effects of coagulation concentrates only 30 min after administration.	1.2432642499402373
An increased volume of distribution and increased turnover may explain the poor recovery of AT III activity in the ALF group, indicating that the dose of coagulation concentrate should be estimated against the background of the patient's clinical symptoms and diagnosis.	1.133813351608772
Fatigue is a common symptom in patients with multiple sclerosis.	1.1202572706997354
Rapid exhaustion and reduced exercise tolerance leads to difficulties in maintaining a normal daily life for many patients.	0.7832956529762768
Regular resting and short breaks can help to compensate this to a  certain degree.	0.9041497973465966
A sixteen year old girl with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis suffered two episodes of toxic shock syndrome within a short period of time.	0.9213109409662202
Both occasions were associated with menstruation.	0.5080081402934835
Mycoplasma hominis was isolated in the tracheal secretions once.	0.8449990288731097
Discussion: The etiology of the toxic shock syndrome has been extensively described.	0.9587390171573401
The toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 acts as a superantigen in toxic shock syndrome and interestingly a similar mechanism is discussed in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.	0.8938217126954817
This case report demonstrates the possibility of a close relationship between toxic shock syndrome and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and raises the suspicion of a similar immunopathogenetic process.	1.0212860523913891
Porokeratos of Mibelli is a rare inherited disorder of epidermal keratinization, whose pathogenesis is not fully understood.	0.9632203743731059
The common clinical feature is a erythematous plaque surrounded by a hyperkeratotic border.	0.77912123553079
The histopathologic hallmark is a parakeratotic cornoid lamella.	0.582371788911741
An unusual case of porokeratosis gigantea, a morphological variant of classical porokeratosis of Mibelli, is reported.	1.054290232359266
The pathogenesis, taking in account especially the clonal hypothesis and premalignant nature of porokeratosis, is discussed.	0.9992650998180421
With the introduction of the non-benzodiazepine hypnotics zopiclone and zolpidem it was expected to have hypnotics without side effects and risks characteristically seen with benzodiazepines.	0.9593792330028332
We report two cases with high-dose usage and dependency of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics.	0.8500268483636261
Both patients were prescribed the drugs to treat sleep disturbances occuring during a depressive episode.	0.9619910274347401
While one patient had a polysubstance abuse there was no evidence for an abuse history in the other patient.	1.0525808205799714
To reduce withdrawal symptoms long-acting benzodiazepines were given to both patients.	0.8941297863145744
Thus, it seems that not only patients with a history of substance abuse but also patients with a psychiatric disorder are at risk for abuse of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics.	1.21446055145843
Considering the increasing number of case reports with abuse and dependence of zopiclone and zolpidem it seems necessary to reevaluate the dependency risk of the currently available non-benzodiazepine hypnotics.	0.8991214940920467
Fractures of the proximal radius in children may lead to deformities of the radial head and functional disturbance of pro- and supination.	1.1488587927799176
However, traumatization is not only caused by the injury itself, but may also occur secondary to surgical reduction, manipulation of fracture fragments and excessive physiotherapy.	1.2454486583387288
In a prospective long-term follow-study (2-20 years after trauma) of 38 children with displaced proximal radius fractures we found functional disturbances in 11 % of children only.	1.3773908323411193
These were not caused by radial head deformities, which were present on 83 % of follow-up radiographs.	1.298879759109748
Functional impairment was mainly seen after open reduction or secondary growth disturbances.	0.8625186942520909
On follow-up radiographs all conservatively treated fracture angulations up to 60  ° had corrected themselves spontaneously.	0.954765364069635
In view of the high complication rates after open reduction and the poor functional results, as well as the inconvenience for the pediatric patient and the economic aspects, we recommend a primary conservative treatment concept of proximal radius fractures in children.	1.2347776520097424
Patients who have undergone cardiac surgery with use of extracorporeal circulation frequently reveal marked hypovolaemia in spite of a highly positive fluid balance.	0.9959998831954019
This is thought to be due to transient microvascular damage and extravascular fluid shift.	0.7438892495822174
Further volume replacement to achieve haemodynamic stability in the postoperative period may cause fluid overload and congestive heart failure.	0.8852125016550868
The present study was designed to investigate whether this fluid overload could be avoided by using a hypertonic-hyperoncotic solution (group I: HHL, 10% hydroxyethylstarch 200/0.5 in 7.2% saline) instead of two different standard colloid solutions (group II: HA, 5% albumin; group III: HES, 6% hydroxyethylstarch in 0.9% saline).	1.2305543469613471
Purpose: The temporomandibular joint is a place of motion where release of proinflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1 (IL-1) induces cartilage destruction via production of nitric oxide (NO).	0.8793755037579071
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of continuous passive motion in the form of cyclic stretch on the synthesis of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).	0.7968392464218127
Methods: Articular chondrocytes were harvested from rabbit cartilage slices and cultured in F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.	0.9918472206439359
Subsequently, cells (105/ml per well) were transferred to Flexercell plates, grown to 90% confluency, and subjected to one of the following regimens: (1) no mechanical strain (10 Hz, 20% elongation rate); (2) rhIL-1 (1 ng/ml); (3) mechanical strain; (4) mechanical strain and rhIL-1.	1.183773714082954
The cells were exposed to cyclic stretch for 24 h. Thereafter, cells were trypsinized and centrifuged on microscope slides in a cytospin centrifuge.	0.8667999982765149
The presence of iNOS was determined by indirect immunoperoxidase staining using polyclonal rabbit anti-iNOS as primary antibodies, and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as secondary antibodies.	0.9930994462795381
Diaminobenzidine was used as substrate for HRP.	0.8170901391259024
Total NO production was spectrophotometrically measured in the supernatants of cultures using Greiss reaction.	0.7333554209487013
All experiments were done in triplicates and the statistical significance was analyzed by Student's t-test.	0.9216777570936521
Results: Cells with treatment 1 and 3 did not exhibit presence of iNOS.	1.154376763446029
IL-1-treated cells in group 2 exhibited intense peroxidase staining.	1.2353565441845087
Cells in group 4 exposed to IL-1 and mechanical stress showed staining with considerably less intensity.	0.9453214064173305
Control cells treated with normal rabbit IgG as a primary antibody did not exhibit peroxidase staining.	0.9421486429306952
The data were further confirmed by measurement of statistically significant differences of NO levels in supernatants assessed in the four different treatment groups.	1.050131760581004
Conclusion: Our findings suggest that continuous passive motion exerts anti-inflammatory effects on chondrocytes, downregulating the quantity of iNOS -positive cells.	1.0037844374335991
Since NO acts as an intracellular, transcellular, and cytotoxic molecule, it has a basic importance for proper post-traumatic and postoperative TMJ function as well as the course and therapy of inflammatory TMJ diseases.	1.3256861703214808
Recently, we presented an implantable piezoelectrical hearing aid transducer.	1.1347436466264087
Its characteristics make it suitable for implantation in patients with sensorineural hearing loss.	0.7199169984124095
The transducer transmits micromechanical vibrations instead of sound into the hearing organ.	0.6441799925301118
Efficiency of the transducer implant was investigated in ten cat ears.	1.0366672661202414
After determining preoperative (acoustical) BERA threshold, the middle ear was opened and the piezoelectrical transducer coupled to various ossicles or the perilymph.	0.9895662008195091
BERA responses were recorded following stimulation of umbo, long incus process, stapes head, stapes foot plate, and vestibulum.	1.0382138211730805
By comparing the acoustical and mechanical threshold, a correlation was found between the stimulus level of acoustical and mechanical stimulation.	0.9124978438175164
An electrical transducer voltage of 1 Vrms* was equivalent to sound-pressure levels between 100 and 128 dB SPL at the tympanic membrane.	0.8635922091619771
To judge hearing impression, stimulus-dependent latencies of the early acoustically and mechanically evoked potentials (waves P1 to P5) and their thresholds were analyzed.	1.0051140812713266
After coupling the piezoelectrical transducer to the long incus process, latencies corresponded well to stimulation.	0.7743101696269635
They were almost completely similar when the equivalent sound-pressure level of 100 dB SPL was achieved by the transducer voltage level.	0.9348934562428974
Pyoderma gangrenosum was first described in 1930 by Brunsting, Goeckermann and O'Leary.	0.7406739694874407
Nevertheless we found some illustrations in an atlas on dermatology, published by Marie-Nicolas Devergie in the first half of the 19th century, which appear to be pyoderma gangrenosum.	0.9505372778826632
In addition to discussions of typical syphilitic affections of the skin, Devergie's "Clinique de la Maladie Syphilitique" includes illustrations of gangrenous ulcers, which appeared unexpectedly after local and systemic therapy with mercury.	0.994208335709072
Devergie interpreted those enlarging ulcers as a side effect of mercury therapy.	0.7395033230815518
Thus we were able to find evidence of pyoderma gangrenosum more than 100 years before first description in 1930.	0.8894873379433671
The etiology of this clinical picture is still unsettled.	1.0202326060817113
The favorite postulate has been a bacterial genesis which was the subject of numerous publications until the 1960s.	0.9586330122253955
Multiple-system atrophy (MSA) is characterized by progressive autonomic failure with cerebellar, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs.	0.9160273216101462
In MSA patients laryngoscopy often reveals unilateral or bilateral abductor vocal fold palsies.	0.6897900431896716
However, assessment of sites of obstruction and their severity is needed.	1.1377742234109576
We report our clinical experience in managing a 56-year-old, obese male MSA patient (1.76 m height, 100 kg weight, BMI 32.3 kg/m2) who was admitted for evaluation of snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness.	1.212136246761975
Endoscopy while awake demonstrated an incomplete abductor vocal fold palsy.	0.6882394626296947
Polysomnography confirmed heavy snoring with arousals (11.1/h) and an RDI of 1.4/h.	1.2883109964071726
Sleep efficiency was low (51.9%) due to long intermittent awake periods.	1.0710981001447768
Sleep videoendoscopy of the upper airway proved the entire pharynx to be open during REM and non-REM sleep.	0.9942237037584208
During inspiration fluttering movements of the vocal cords caused the snoring.	0.7446760955547966
This was regularly terminated by arousals.	0.5541464767486263
The further treatment is discussed.	0.7031945732246202
In general, glottic snoring without daytime stridor is rare and has only been described in MSA patients.	0.9912633190820058
However, certain of these patients will also be pharyngeal snorers.	1.439216430070716
The source of the sound and site of obstruction can only be diagnosed by sleep videoendoscopy.	0.9672220950127465
Introduction: Homografts for valve replacement are indicated in acute valve endocarditis.	1.0687803337614112
It is assumed that they possess anti-infective properties.	0.7743709794561201
Homografts are an established indication in aortic valve replacement.	0.8136353899663986
We present our early results with homografts for mitral valve replacement in acute endocarditis.	0.9498026698921556
The surgical management of enlarged inferior turbinates has been actively debated for more than a century.	0.7997560019564683
The second part of this review decribes the following techniques: laterofracture, submucous turbinectomy, concho-antropexy, partial turbinectomy, anterior turbinectomy, inferior turbinoplasty, total turbinectomy, and vidian neurectomy.	1.051195725878634
Indications, advantages, disadvantages, complications, and controversies of each treatment modalitiy are reviewed and discussed.	0.9560973772938546
Partial or submucosal resection should be prefered, because there are moderate side effects and the amount of turbinate excised can be altered according the degree of symptomatology.	0.9136328185393724
Total turbinectomy or vidian neurectomy are indicated if all other treatment attemps do not succeed.	0.7794163889425155
Acute oxalosis is an important disorder causing serious abnormalities.	0.8286937975884914
Acute oxalosis may come about by ethylene glycol poisoning; in recent years iatrogenic cases of acute oxalosis have also been described following iv treatments of naftidrofuryl, a vasodilator.	1.0565123931913578
Furthermore, chronic asymptomatic intestinal oxalosis may turn symptomatic by a superimposed major load of oxalate.	1.13650251261251
Acute oxalosis results in acute renal failure; in addition oxalate-induced angiopathy may be associated with necrosis of affected tissue.	1.0294772992943424
The diagnosis of acute oxalosis requires a demonstration of oxalate crystals in the urine and in other affected tissues.	1.109993267892507
In terms of therapy, hemodialysis should be used promptly in cases of ethylene glycol poisoning and a worsening of the renal function.	0.9178034813340092
In cases of a secondary chronic intestinal oxalosis prophylactic measures such as maintaining an elevated urinary flow rate and prescribing oral calcium supplements will be helpful.	0.9269214600036646
Generalized granuloma annulare is a rare variant of granuloma annulare affecting the trunk and extremities with a multitude of lesions.	0.9510838857082023
In contrast to localized granuloma annulare, generalized granuloma annulare occurs in older patients, shows a stronger association with diabetes, and is characteristically chronic.	1.1607741548678336
Like our 55-year-old patient, most patients present with papules and annular plaques; less often, macular or non-annular lesions may be encountered.	0.9384523427540261
Histology often fails to show necrobiotic or necrotic connective tissue changes demarcated by a palisading granuloma.	0.7691535941507025
Instead, there are diffuse dermal, band-like or nodular aggregations of histiocytes intermingled with some multinucleated giant cells and a predominantly lymphocytic infiltrate in the periphery.	1.026924751299058
Because of its special characteristics, it has been suggested that generalized granuloma annulare might constitute a separate disease entity and that it should be classed among the primary cutaneous histiocytoses as a diffuse dermal histiocytosis.	1.0675264598792196
Using immunohistochemistry to determine the macrophage phenotype of the lesional histiocytes, we have shown that generalized granuloma annulare is not a cutaneous histiocytosis.	1.1508816213179456
Neither MS-1 high-molecular-weight protein, a new specific marker for cutaneous non-Langerhans cell histiocytoses, nor CD1a, the well-known marker for Langerhans cells and Langerhans cell histiocytoses, is expressed by the lesional histiocytes of our patient.	1.1160470775671212
In contrast, the antigen expression pattern was diagnostic for non-infectious granulomas and was highly similar to that in localized granuloma annulare.	0.9885211149997116
In contrast to the successful treatment of localized granuloma annulare reported with intralesional interferon -1, systemic treatment with interferon -2b (9x106 units three times a week) was ineffective.	1.2065928592224822
The aims of the study were: (1) to predict reversal time from intensive atracurium blockade; and (2) to determine the optimal time of neostigmine administration during recovery from atracurium blockade, i.e., the time at which the administration of neostigmine results in the shortest total recovery time (time from administration of last supplemental dose of atracurium to train-of-four [TOF] ratio 0.70), and at the same time results in the shortest time from administration of neostigmine to TOF ratio 0.70.	1.1857348747454097
The spontaneous and neostigmine-facilitated recovery in 52 healthy women anaesthetised with thiopentone, fentanyl, droperidol, and nitrous oxide was followed.	0.8616473658615139
Post-tetanic count (PTC) of TOF stimulation of the ulnar nerve and mechanomyography were used for monitoring neuromuscular transmission.	1.0148571613633781
The neuromuscular blockade was induced with atracurium 0.6 mg/kg and supplemental doses of 0.15 mg/kg were given when the first twitch response in the TOF (TH1) had recovered to 20%.	1.1773311515160128
Neostigmine 0.036 mg/kg body weight was given at different levels of neuromuscular blockade to 37 of the patients.	1.0310307679698927
Multiple regression analyses including pre-reversal time (time from administration of the last atracurium dose to neostigmine administration), PTC, weight, and age of the patients suggest that pre-reversal time is the best predictor of reversal time: reversal time=27.3 min-(0.89xpre-reversal time [min]; (SEE=6.0 min).	1.1604228960048213
If pre-reversal time is unknown, PTC can be used: reversal time=24 min-(4.5xln PTC) at time of reversal); (SEE=6.8 min).	1.2170176252823408
Total recovery time was 47 min (SEM=2.0 min, n=15) in the patients allowed to recover spontaneously, and 29 min (SEM=1.2 min, n=29) in the patients reversed by neostigmine; the difference of 18 min (SE diff 2.0 min) was significant (P<0.0005).	1.296709343924325
The level of blockade indicated by PTC (1 - 24) at the time of reversal had no influence on the total recovery time.	1.13049359253375
The spontaneous recovery times from reappearance of TH1 and TH1=10% to TOF ratio 0.70 were 29.2 min (SEM=1.7 min) and 24.4 min (SEM=2.6 min), respectively.	1.0913543853498406
The results suggest that pre-reversal time is the strongest predictor of reversal time when neostigmine is administered during intense atracurium blockade.	0.8330075091533963
To achieve the optimal time-saving effect, neostigmine must be given 18 min (the time saved by giving neostigmine) plus 7 to 11 min (needed for neostigmine to reach its peak effect), giving a total of 25 to 29 min before TOF ratio 0.70.	1.0746155255363057
As TH1 is between 1% and 10% 25 to 29 min before TOF ratio 0.70 is reached during spontaneous recovery, the optimal level of neuromuscular blockade for neostigmine administration in atracurium blockade is when TH1 is between 1% and 10%.	0.9887653354233585
Reversal time can be predicted as 27.3 min-(0.89xpre-reversal time (min), and the optimal time of neostigmine administration in atracurium blockade appears to be when TH1 is 1% - 10%.	1.1876154171620028
A seminar for hospital physicians in management positions (Württembergische Verwaltungs- und Wirtschaftsakademie, Stuttgart) in October 1994 illustrated the immediate relevance of W. R. Bion's book Experiences in Groups and Other Papers, published in 1961.	0.9862547433962047
The aim of this article, recalling Bion's experiences in groups by presenting in seminar's leadership principles, is to show how these experiences can be applied to an understanding of the individual.	1.1227562073015296
If continuous seizure activity lasts longer than 5 minutes generalized tonic-clonic seizures require prompt treatment, if significant morbidity and mortality are to be avoided.	1.0002242776727972
The mortality varies (mean: 20%) depending on patient age and etiology.	1.2915109946680536
Control of status epilepticus is achieved by benzodiazepines in about 80% of cases: Lorazepam is recommended due to its longer-acting effects on the central nervous system.	1.0957932927829275
To maintain the anticonvulsive effect phenytoin is usually administered intravenously.	0.7410443696248824
Fosphenytoin (not approved in Germany) has advantages over phenytoin, because it can be given three times more rapidly and produces fewer side effects.	1.1772214517629231
The IV use of valproic acid in status epilepticus seems to be promising, but needs further evaluation.	0.9417077664837569
There is no generally accepted treatment protocol for the therapy of persistent seizure activity lasting more than 60 minutes (i. e., refractory status epilepticus).	1.090446445581185
Usually phenobarbital, or general anesthesia with thiopental or pentobarbital are treatment recommendations.	0.9273902502335145
In recent reports, the administration of midazolam or propofol proved to be effective and well-tolerated.	1.162546945886925
Since the life span of our society is increasing and the expectation of high functional demands is growing more and more older people take part in sports activities emphasises the necessity of early diagnosis of rotator cuff lesions and their correct treatment.	0.9820248461076732
The goal of any diagnostic means should be a proper treatment of rotator cuff lesions according to the detected pathology.	1.0523426620524656
New arthroscopic techniques to surgically reconstruct rotator cuff tears have brought the operative repair techniques another step further.	0.8550287742663327
In cases of large and complex cuff tears the surgeon can individually select an adequate reconstruction procedure which includes anatomical-, partial-, tendon-transfer and muscle-transfer repairs.	1.2093309542752517
In cases of irreparable tears with cuff-tear arthropathy and consecutive superior migration of the humeral head hemiarthroplasty or the inverse deltoid prosthesis have to be considered.	0.8564506236289107
Based on clinical, radiological and arthroscopic findings we developed algorithms that will lead to the best suited procedure for a given lesion.	1.0831497295998256
Almost all patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) experience symptoms of nocturnal hypoventilation during the course of the illness.	0.907849606999553
These symptoms can develop  years before death and may severely affect quality of life.	0.8723027392014658
Non-invasive intermittent home mechanical ventilation (HMV) via mask is a possible palliative measure for  these symptoms, which is not often used in  Germany.	1.169179937452117
We report on our experience with HMV in 24 patients with ALS.	1.142666247262458
Our data show a good palliative effect in 17 of 24 treated patients.	1.0065394470258306
Severe complications did not occur.	0.30366679646785516
The mean ventilation time at present is  14 months.	0.8875416928537659
Available options and their  consequences need to be discussed in detail with patients and relatives before HMV is  initiated.	1.0953669847269245
Many clinical studies have been performed investigating corneal endothelial cell loss after penetrating keratoplasty using different preservation methods.	0.9950179320327768
Most studies, however, included variable follow-up intervals, neglecting the dynamic cell loss over the course of time.	1.0939465766766956
The aim of this study was to perform endothelial cell evaluation 5 years after penetrating keratoplasty using two different storage methods.	0.9264415147263719
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is generally associated with ulcerative colitis (UC).	1.0309490581312637
The disease typically progresses slowly, but ultimately, and leads to cirrhosis, liver failure or bile duct cancer.	1.078361348963469
PSC patients with simultanous ulcerative colitis are also at higher risk for colorectal cancer.	0.715221300308157
At the present time, there is no effective treatment for PSC, although preliminary data show encouraging results after treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid.	1.0519895204120429
However, there are no data concerning the delay or prevention of progress of the disease with this drug, because follow-up time is not yet long enough.	1.4610577644575518
Isolated bile duct strictures should be treated endoscopically.	0.8607143646404527
The possible effect of proctocolectomy on the course of PSC is controversial.	0.7698922129509422
Liver transplantation is the therapy of choice for PSC in its final stage.	0.9089923064702327
The 5-year survival rate (89 %) is significantly better than after transplantation for other indications.	1.2068093857526694
Patients with ulcerative colitis have to be followed up by lifelong colonoscopy.	0.8401721638823514
Although the course of UC after transplantation is mostly asymptomatic, these patients are at higher risk for colorectal cancer.	1.1016870208123406
On 3 June 1998 a high-speed train (Inter City Express, ICE) collided with a bridge at a speed of 200 km/h.	0.90493698078933
The bridge collapsed and the rear wagons of the train were pushed into it with the power of the rear engine.	0.8314108029191657
The accident caused 101 deaths and 103 injuries.	0.623335337380304
Four minutes after the accident the alarm was raised, and 16 minutes after the accident the first doctor was on the scene, arriving from Celle, approx.	1.0510552152763961
Severe complications after chiropractic treatments rarely occur.	0.6058360912104059
They happen mostly when manipulating the atlantoaxial and the craniovertebral articulations or when not attending to the contraindications like partial dislocation and hemivertebra.	0.7758927859030411
Therefore, x-ray pictures from the part of the vertebral region to be treated are inevitable and likewise the medical scientific associations demand them uniformly to minimize the risks.	1.1397673357855826
Nevertheless, our case-report shows also inconspicuous radiological findings do not exclude local tumor infestation of the bones with possible deleterious results for the patient treated by the chiropractor.	1.194119951007803
In patients with painful, possibly hemorrhagic vesicles or black crusts, especially on hands/fingers or face/neck with typical history (contact to cows or feral/cats) the possibility of a cowpox/catpox infection has to be considered.	0.9810056885470089
The clinical diagnosis can be confirmed with the electron microscopy; cytoplasmic inclusions may be detected histologically.	0.9994999692661881
Further useful diagnostic tools are the identification of the cowpox/catpox virus by PCR or in cell culture as well as serological tests to detect virus specific antibodies.	0.9719053322046939
We report the development of typical skin lesions of a cowpox/catpox infection in two female patients who had contact with cows or cats.	1.157103241964653
Recent diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are also discussed.	1.0159762246982167
The laboratory findings of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets are signs of an acute pregnancy complication often associated with abdominal pain and intrauterine growth retardation.	1.0325962672095486
A high coincidence with symptoms of preeclampsia is observed.	0.7594186202506508
The high rate of complications and the restitution of laboratory findings to normal values following cessation of pregnancy have led to the general recommendation of immediate delivery for about a decade.	1.0414320197860971
However, the fact that HELLP syndrome can also occur for up to 1 week post-partum and the results of studies on prolongation of pregnancy call this former concept of management into question, in particular, since there is a high rate of hemostasiological complications after cesarean section in acute HELLP syndrome.	1.1359795414289466
Because of the correlation of complications of HELLP syndrome with those of severe preeclampsia, the indication for delivery should be based on the signs of preeclampsia and additional clinical features.	1.0423501601703467
The results of studies on prolongation of pregnancies in HELLP syndrome and severe preeclampsia support this concept.	0.8506546857085474
Innervation of the head and neck differs from other regions of the body in certain respects.	1.0103156435733909
In particular, besides the external cuneate nucleus, thick-calibre neck muscle afferents project directly, to the vestibular nuclear complex.	0.9981398570188392
This projection is most prominent in segments C2 and 3 and is sparse or absent in more caudal segments.	0.8995845443523013
Thus, proprioceptive neck muscle afferents gain direct access to vestibulospinal, vestibulooculomotor and other secondary or even higher order vestibular neurons that receive labyrinthine input.	0.9189658780405308
Proprioceptive input via indirect spinovestibular pathways is also most prominent from C2 and 3 compared to more caudal levels.	0.8250527104027496
Likewise, thin calibre, mainly nociceptive afferents from cervical segments are channelled via the parabrachial nuclei in the rostral pons to limbic structures different from the targets of thoracolumbar afferents.	0.9370730696441979
It is tempting to consider these neuroantomical peculiarities relevant for the pathogenesis of the puzzling symptoms after whiplash injury.	0.8920383842750642
In some recent German textbooks of pain management there is maintained that psychological dependence to opioids in pain patients is not a real problem.	0.9818808320809331
The evidence for this statement is reviewed.	0.9544612507118322
Real bone tumors are rarely encountered in the daily routine of radiological practice.	0.9260707322914072
Therefore, for a general radiologist there is no need for a specialist knowledge on this field.	1.502952610015716
However, he should be able to distinguish benign from malignant lesions in order to avoid unnecessary biopsies.	1.3755288514587767
A systematic approach towards osteolytic lesions, e. g. according to the classification of Lodwick, is mandatory.	0.9695861328932144
CT and MRI are indicated to clear up the anatomy in areas of superposition artefacts in conventional radiology and to determine the inner structure of a lesion, e. g. fatty tissue, liquid/solid.	0.9657146981993076
This paper highlights the advantages and disadvantages and the cost-effective use of the imaging modalities including scintigraphy in the diagnosis of bone tumors and tumor-like lesions.	1.2482756518686837
Guidelines for the management of bony lesions will be given in detail.	0.9260893036477427
The option and necessity for a specialist second opinion is emphasized.	0.8651572104649077
During routine middle ear surgery prototypes of implantable piezoelectric hearing aid transducers were coupled to the ossicular chain of 28 patients.	0.8673794435039773
Pure tone thresholds in a broad frequency range (250 Hz-8 kHz) and perception of music were the basis of psychoacoustic evaluation of the transfer properties of the prototypes in this human study.	1.1344935240162373
The piezoelectric transducer reached an equivalent transducer sound-pressure level of up to 145 dB SPL and frequencies of 10 kHz.	0.8389790031968466
The dynamics for music reached 32 dB, which was identical with the results of the preoperative investigations using hi-fi headsets (33 dB).	1.2093256770438086
The low nonlinear distortions of around 0.1% and the frequency range up to 10 kHz are reflected in the positive evaluation of sound quality by 84% of the patients involved.	1.278536689600494
The study is the basis for realizing a piezoelectric transducer designed for routine clinical implantations.	1.0399736938918138
The transducer is thought to be part of a totally implantable future hearing aid for rehabilitation of moderate and severe sensory neural hearing loss predominantly in the middle and high frequency range.	1.0349198314249337
Background: Baker et al.	1.268831984741259
used a CO2 laser for blepharoplasty for the first time.	0.757461504542598
The ultrapulse CO2 laser provides a sophisticated instrument that makes more application alternatives possible in ophthalmology.	0.7856089306229577
Several investigations prove that monaural acoustic deprivation induces detrimental changes in the auditory pathway.	0.8221827114323933
So far the major interest focused on degenerative processes on the deprived side, while effects on the contralateral untreated side were not taken into consideration.	1.0041459811296847
This ontogenetic study investigates effects of early monaural acoustic deprivation on the functional development of the acoustically evoked auditory brainstem response (ABR) in the Mongolian gerbil.	1.066174556616106
Young gerbils were deafened by a single intracochlear application of neomycin sulfate.	0.756373863620201
The ABR development on the contralateral side differed in a late developmental period from that of normally hearing animals.	0.889537256560906
These changes persisted until adulthood.	0.49679885026549625
Between day 55 and day 90 a significant 5 dB decrease of the ABR thresholds and a significant shortening of the interpeak latency II-V occured.	0.9355927599987234
The results confirm that a complete monaural deprivation during the sensible or critical period leads on the contralateral side to plastic or compensatory changes in the auditory brainstem.	0.9752359887650749
There are estimated to be 20 million people blinded by cataracts, 80-90 % of whom live in rural areas of developing countries where expert surgical resources are scarce.	0.9510426237794602
The majority of all cataract operations are still intracapsular extractions (ICCE).	0.92371673777442
Aphakic correction using spectacles is problematical in developing countries.	0.6115467823552186
This study was undertaken to evaluate the safety of multiflex open loop anterior chamber intraocular lenses (AC IOLs).	1.0534978673463273
Dorsal fusion with the internal fixator has become the standard treatment of instabilities and deformities of the thoracolumbar spine.	0.9637171403195893
With our new device, the modular spine fixator (MSF), which has been specially designed for short-distance instrumentations, we have increasingly been treating unstable injuries of the thoracolumbar spine by one-level stabilization.	1.1674737852539685
Prerequisite is an accurate evaluation of the indication, including CT and MRI to assess the involvement of the intervertebral disc and the ligamental structures.	1.1641440474316722
The operative technique differs in some details from the procedure in moremulti-level instrumentations, especially concerning the application of the pedicle screws.	1.103855500024286
The instrumentation is always combined with posterior allogenic bone grafting.	0.7292462510683273
Since the beginning of 1993 we also perform anterior autogenic transpedicular bone grafting.	0.8006201612491298
Between Januar 1991 and July 1995, 57 one-level stabilizations with the MSF were performed.	0.882228056384825
Of the 57 patients operated on 39, 27 men and 12 women, with an average age of 41 years, have had a clinical and radiographic follow-up examination so far, on average, 27 months after the accident.	1.3051660353042431
Seventeen patients were completely free of pain and 17 patients (were only) sensivite to weather changes or had minor pain during great physical stress.	0.9609141447380642
Five patients had pain even during slight physical stress or at rest.	0.8593418474227975
The preoperatively measured Cobb angle was 15.1  ° on average, after the operation 5.2  °, and at the time of the follow-up examination amounted to 8.1  °.	1.3041017545423612
The patients' range of motion was normal.	1.1266606476875323
Only five minor complications have been seen.	0.7229709105015383
No implant fatigue failure has been noted in this series.	0.7607003382686919
We derive from these results that, for correct indications, one-level stabilization can be performed successfully and should be firmly established in the operative treatment of unstable fractures of the thoracolumbar spine.	1.1605750587776327
Between May 1995 and March 1996 we were able to diagnose and remove glomus tumors of the left nasal cavity from three female patients.	1.0157370540954296
Ages of the patients were 9, 36 and 74 years.	1.3002217187707659
All patients suffered from a frequent epistaxis and all were extremely sensitive to the slightest nasal touch.	0.9302870806937553
One patient reported breathing difficulties due to nasal congestion.	0.6825330250904201
Examination revealed a tumor that filled the entire nasal cavity.	0.8667293043731511
The method of choice in treatment of these tumors is surgical removal.	1.2004370927278447
Hemangiopericytoma, non-chromaffin paraganglioma,  hidradenoma, cavernous hemangioma and nevus cell nevi have to be excluded by histology and immunohistochemical techniques.	1.057800085482327
From a clinical perspective the bleeding  septal polyp (granuloma telangiectaticum sive pyogenicum sive pediculatum) has to be considered because it often comes from Kieselbachi's plexus, has a mushroom-like appearance and bleeds slightly.	1.0563988600860714
Background: Gynaecological surgery including laparoscopy is frequently associated with PONV.	1.16000914419864
Therefore, choosing an anaesthetic with only little side effects in operations eligible for outpatient surgery is at least as important as applying anaesthetics that enable fast-tracking.	1.1152578570491962
The reliability of continuous fibreoptic oximetry in cerebral venous blood and its correlation with intracranial and cerebral perfusion pressures (pressure-volume curve) were examined in an experimental porcine study.	1.1343449790483153
In a population-based study of 110 women between 53 and 82 years of age (mean age 64.5 +/- 7.9 years) static posturography data were compared to functional items of gait and balance in common geriatric mobility scales.	1.0050870198357589
Posturographic data of double-stance with eyes open and eyes closed (DSEO; DSEC) did not differ from those of a group of healthy women previously tested for intact nervous system function.	0.9505989749991867
The total neuromuscular score - roughly corresponding to the well-known Tinetti score - did not correlate to the posturographic measures.	1.0534493658949424
DSEC correlated with the items "rapid walking" and "single-stance left leg".	0.7867868743004884
Age, vision, and neuropsychologic test results correlated with DSEO, "rapid walking", "single-stance right leg", "single-stance left leg", and "walking a figure eight".	1.1138387772164322
Multiple linear regression confirmed the impact of age, vision, DSEO, and DSEC on "rapid walking" with a 34% variance explanation.	0.9710584415549711
Posturographic parameters did predict other selected gait and balance items.	0.7306617628120488
When used in older women living independently in the community, parameters of static posturography reflect to some extent the functional disabilities of gait and balance.	0.9720679909516032
The ocular surface epithelia with the tear film as a unit provide clear vision and comfort and serve as the first line of defense.	0.887038702907881
It is important to understand how ocular surface health is maintained and how ocular surface failure occurs.	0.8592687772225786
Furthermore, it is timely to summarize new information concerning action mechanisms and clinical uses of amniotic membrane transplantation for ocular surface reconstruction.	1.0985215468609528
When appropriately processed and preserved, amniotic membrane as a native matrix can be used as a graft to restore conjunctival surfaces following removal of lesions such as pterygium, tumor, scar, symblepharon, and conjunctivochalasis.	0.9453085816050588
It can also be used as a graft to restore corneal surfaces suffering from limbal stem-cell deficiency.	0.881700528760071
For partial limbal deficiency, amniotic membrane alone is frequently sufficient, while for total limbal deficiency it needs to be combined with limbal stem-cell transplantation with or without corneal transplantation.	0.9193900189200112
When used as a graft or patch, amniotic membrane can facilitate healing of persistent corneal ulcers and recurrent corneal erosion and reduce corneal haze following keratectomy.	0.9004104148144039
Reported data indicate that amniotic membrane transplantation facilitates rapid healing with recovery of a normal epithelial phenotype in the epithelium and reduces inflammation, vascularization, and scarring in the stroma.	0.9798675361749559

According to the recommendations of the German Ophthalmological Sociaty (DOG), PRK in myopic patients between -1.0 dpt and -6.0 dpt is a scientific acknowled treatment.	1.3392840854997357
The risks of the treatment, however, increase in myopia above -6.0 dpt.	1.3265891675099386
Introduction: Improved socio-economic conditions have led to an increase of adult height during the last century.	1.2435320168129156
If excessive height is regarded as a serious psychological handicap, final height can be reduced by early and high doses treatment with sexual steroids.	1.032368405487964
This therapy influences pubertal development and growth of healthy adolescents.	0.7871003555818832
For that reason patients should be carefully selected, taking into account the benefits and possible side effects.	0.9768404527030772
Colour measurements were performed on powdery substances of whitish to slightly yellow colouring (cocaine samples of different composition) in order to give an unequivocal optical description of the samples and relate them to control samples.	1.0159534822841096
The measurements were carried out with a spectrophotometer (Carl-Zeiss-Jena GmbH, MCS 400) using a halogen bulb as light source (standard illuminant D65).	0.9739568835561456
Colorimetric classification was made on the basis of the CIE-L*a*b*-values.	0.7135752809913856
The examination showed that specimens of similar or different chemical composition which could not be distinguished macroscopically revealed characteristic differences in the CIE-L*a*b*-measures.	0.7753756663274034
The method gives a first clue for orientation within a few minutes when comparing substances in specimens of different origin.	1.000045790532515
Eighty-five patients with grade 2 or grade 3 sprains of the acromioclavicular (AC) joint were evaluated clinically and radiographically 32 months after injury.	1.0741412047412604
Group I included 34 patients with grade 2 sprains (Tossy II) and group II included 51 patients with grade 3 injuries (Tossy III).	1.150925899144126
In group I, 15 patients were treated surgically (group I a) and 19 patients were treated conservatively (group I b), while in group II, 41 patients were treated surgically (group II a) and 10 patients were treated conservatively (group II b).	1.3843476987851395
At surgery open reduction and transarticular fixation of the AC joint with Kirschner wires was performed.	0.8311400133024008
Conservative treatment included the initial use of a sling or a knapsack bandage and early performance of range-of-motion exercises.	1.0082357706604614
Shoulder function was assessed according to the score devised by Constant and Murley.	0.8939621209244013
In both groups, 97 of 100 possible points (minimum 72, maximum 100) were obtained after conservative and after surgical treatment.	1.0948324800352913
Nine of 10 patients (90%) with grade 3 sprains (group IIb) had more pronounced displacement and increased mobility of the lateral end of the clavicle after conservating treatment.	1.2633073160023547
After surgery, dislocation and increased horizontal, mobility of the lateral end of the clavicle occurred in 18 (44%) of 41 patients with grade 3 sprains (group II a P<0.0001).	1.1375495387215755
However, these findings did not correlate with the functional outcome.	1.1062925647313475
At follow-up there was a significant increase in degenerative changes seen on radio-graphs (P<0.035) in all patients.	1.1985427834545261
Again these findings did not correlate with the functional outcome.	0.5519076702698463
More degenerative radiological changes were observed in patients who had undergone surgery (P<0.003).	1.1438896546896444
Patients with grade 2 sprains were more frequently restricted in sporting activity after surgery (P<0.05).	0.7070259353688991
Patients with grade 3 sprains who were treated surgically complained of pain more frequently (P<0.01), and they returned to work later than patients who were treated conservatively after grade 3 sprains.	1.1351534153883047
An additional rehabilitation program guided by a physiotherapist seemed to have no impact on the functional outcome.	0.9105484639953533
A total of 56 patients were treated by surgery.	1.0596612758156367
Among these patients 11 complications occurred, requiring five additional surgical procedures.	0.8325687948310984
Among 29 conservatively treated patients, only in 1 patient did subacromially located arthritic changes of the AC joint have to be removed.	1.1106718412179242
Macular amyloidosis (MA) and lichen amyloidosus (LA) are the two major variants of the primary cutaneous amyloidoses which present with severe and therapy resistent itching.	1.2645837273404774
Various therapeutic modalities such as antihistamines, intralesional injection or topical application of corticosteroids, etretinate, UVB irradiation and dermoabrasion have been employed with variable success.	0.8586415886750649
Recently, in a few case reports authors have observed encouraging beneficial clinical effects by using topical dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO).	1.2324858007427826
In our study 10 patients with either MA or LA or biphasic amyloidosis were treated with a 50% solution of DMSO in water.	1.1797871655041265
9 of them showed marked clinical improvement at the end of 6-20 weeks of treatment.	0.9938961731762149
Degranulation and depletion of the mast cells by DMSO is the most probable explanation for the rapid improvement of itching beginning within the first week of therapy.	1.0840737680252854
Remarkable flattening of the lichenoid papules which was obtained within 11 weeks of treatment is interpreted as a result of the improvement of itching and the related scratch effect.	1.090973772705263
Histological examination after treatment revealed no disappearance of amyloid deposits in the papillary dermis.	0.8471585920255685
In the follow-up period relapses of itching and papules were observed.	0.9741477410878817
Therefore further studies are needed to find out the optimal procedure of therapy.	0.9063862072983352
As early as 1974, Brian advocated the prone position for ventilated patients [5].	0.8975387715451607
He suggested that this position might enhance ventilation of the dorsal parts of the lungs, thereby improving oxygenation.	1.1322022257229511
These considerations have been confirmed by several experimental and clinical studies [1, 6, 13, 17].	0.9790682990829528
Better secretion removal, decreased intrapulmonary shunting, and an increased FRC are thought to be responsible for the observed improvement of oxygenation.	1.1047457407776025
However, the prone position never became very popular in the clinical treatment of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).	0.9720996763816647
Routine performance of thoracic CT scans in ARDS patients demonstrated preferential distribution of pathological densities in the dependent lung areas.	0.842767113548302
The prone position therefore could possibly benefit these patients, as shown by two recent studies [8, 11].	1.0600769313615483
The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of repeatedly turning the patient to the prone position on gas exchange and thoracic CT findings in multiple-trauma patients.	0.8855310689745506
Seven ventilated intensive care patients with severe ARDS (Murray Score >2.5 [9], Quotient >0.7 [4], mean airway pressure >18 cm H2O, thoracic CT scan showing dorsal atelectases) were included in the study.	1.4116244125822757
Patients were turned from the supine to the prone position at 12-h intervals using an air-cushion bed (Mediscus, Austria).	0.8809079978616169
Redistribution of dystelectatic or atelectatic dependent lung areas was verified by means of repeated thoracic CT scans (Figs.	0.7201071431522333
The patients were intermittently turned for 6.5  +/-  1.1 days.	1.2069912384901336
The course of gas exchange is shown in Figs.	0.971586803897595
Initially, improvement of the respiratory quotient could only be achieved during prone positioning, from the 2nd day in the supine position as well.	1.1824976907059574
Intrapulmonary shunting showed a similar trend (Figs.	0.6035439124437041
No significant changes in cardiovascular parameters could be observed.	0.7043877177510114
Control thoracic CT scans showed uniform reduction of atelectases in dependent lung areas (Figs.	0.7700267378142609
The inspiratory fraction of oxygen could be reduced significantly as of the 2nd day (Fig.	0.9347000183285918
Constant levels of positive end-expiratory pressure and tidal volume were associated with decreasing mean and plateau airway pressures (Fig.	0.8193775417652539
Repeatedly turning the patient to the prone position produced long-lasting improvement of arterial oxygenation, which persists up to the end of the weaning process.	1.0961313992861865
This is in good accordance with other studies [1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 13, 17], however, this is the first study to report an observation period of more than 6 days of repeatedly turning the patient.	1.1253202757146177
These positive effects on gas exchange can be attributed to sudden improvement of the ventilation-perfusion ratio within the lung areas that become dependent after turning to the prone position.	0.7928580699206359
Due to reduced hydrostatic pressure [11] and relative hyperventilation [7, 16], previously collapsed alveoli are recruited in the lung areas that become non-dependent after turning to the prone position.	0.9514914979242484
After a gynecological operation under therapy with unfractionated and low molecular weight heparin, a 63 year old patient developed right-sided ascending pelvic thrombosis with multiple pulmonary embolism and infarction pneumonia, septic-toxic circulatory failure, and thrombocytopenia.	1.0764602537792394
Heparin-associated thrombocytopenia (HAT) type II was diagnosed.	0.8984265120141733
Because of contraindications against thrombolysis a cava-filter was implanted, heparin therapy was stopped, and anticoagulation with recombinant hirudin was started.	0.9740529699881295
Inspite of this, an arterial thrombosis of the A. femoralis superficialis developed and had to be treated surgically.	1.0515948228850664
From this time on, no further thromboembolic complications were noticed.	0.9768188270394732
Overlapping coumarin therapy was begun.	0.5803840659111102
Due to ubiquitous coumarin-necrosis, rapid progressive toxic circulatory failure with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) developed two days after terminating hirudin therapy necessitating high dose catecholamine therapy.	0.8208968027031057
A second course of hirudin resulted in complete restitution of the coumarin-necrosis without the need for re-operation.	0.780799297793071
Subsequent coumarin-therapy, which was gradually increased over two weeks, was without further complications.	1.1947914419989663
Thus, hirudin appears to be a new and safe alternative to a therapy with the heparinoid danaparoid in HAT type II with fulminant thromboembolic complications and especially in coumarin-necrosis with critical septic-toxic circulatory failure and DIC.	1.097709552140986
A prospective process-analysis evaluating organizational, medical and medical-technical alterations and real-time-documentation during out-of-hospital resuscitations (n=71) was performed due to the definitions of the "Utstein-Style".	1.0594337194545067
The gaseous radical nitric oxide (NO) is catalyzed by conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline by one cytokine inducible form (iNOS), which becomes active only within hours after the inducing event, and by two constitutively expressed forms, endothelial (eNOS) and neuronal (nNOS), which are regulated by the cytosolic concentration of free Ca2+.	1.1329686176758604
Brain nNOS is physiologically present in discrete populations of neurons, which are all excited by glutamate via the ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, which controls a Ca2+ channel.	0.9332103676925508
After its diffusion into the extraneuronal space, NO may activate in neurons, which as a rule do not stain for NOS, soluble guanylyl cyclase and formation of cGMP as an intracellular messenger.	0.9775297639590464
Beyond that, NO is important as a feedback regulator of glutamatergic excitation.	0.8930662198506912
NO as a nitrosylating agent enhances disulfide bonding of vicinal sulfhydryl (thiol) groups of the redox modulatory site of the NMDA receptor complex and thereby down-regulates its Ca2+ channel activity.	0.8159691571271926
Histochemically studies have revealed the presence of large number of NOS containing neurons in the magnocellular and parvocellular subdivisions of hypothalamic nuclei.	0.8806688067816504
Numerous studies conform to the view that NO participates in the control of many different neurosecretory processes, especially of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurosecretory system.	0.9338362164319784
The redox-modulatory site of the NMDA receptor appears, therefore, as a critical structure in the control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis.	0.8906751219845854
Moreover, glucocorticoids augment neuronal excitotoxicity by increasing the expression of glutamate receptors and inhibition of glutamate reuptake.	0.9235887663500918
In attempting to explain the many conflicting results obtained in studies with NO, it may be worthwhile to consider that the actual redox-environment of distinct loci of the brain may determine the final function of NO, acting either as a transmitter or neuromodulator or, in the worst case, causing neurodestruction.	1.1265114600280186
It seems likely that any kind of stress by altering the ratio of reduced vs oxidized thiols within the central nervous system influences neuronal excitability, with NO working either as an amplifier or as a feedback regulator of neuronal excitation or inhibition, which may alter acutely or chronically, among others, the homeostasis of a given neurosecretory system.	1.0811364245287671
Purpose: To study early and late findings of macular retinal thickness in patients with hypotony following filtering procedures.	1.0478189152922965
Even in the era of coronary stenting, acute coronary artery occlusion continues to represent a significant limitation of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA).	0.873429494795946
Despite application of heparin and aspirin, abrupt vessel closure still occurs in 2-8%, depending on the definition applied.	1.0717383881455038
Especially patients receiving PTCA for acute coronary syndromes are at high risk for abrupt vessel closure.	0.9288812725197501
The formation of an intracoronary thrombus plays a central role in the pathogenesis of abrupt vessel closure.	0.8087281534343244
Dipyridamole induces dilatation of coronary arteries and prevents platelet aggregation by a mechanism that differs from that of aspirin.	0.8889461130523545
The primary purpose of the study was to evaluate whether adjunctive local intracoronary therapy with dipyridamole could reduce the incidence of coronary artery occlusion following PTCA.	1.0456194840849542
Secondary endpoints were defined as myocardial infarction, necessity for bypass grafting, and death.	1.0192799243649981
The intravesical instillation of BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) in cases of relapsed superficial bladder cancer is an acknowledged kind of prophylaxis.	0.882478105156718
It is uncertainly up to now whether a verification of the immune systems competence is necessary.	0.9647745101183877
The recommendations in this problem are very different.	0.8167988130801594
In conclusion to the recent literature we think that a verification of the immune system before BCG installation in the urinary bladder has not a prognostic value.	0.9838596772850764
Additionally, the legal obligingness of this immunotest is doubtful.	0.893897511775399
Discoid meniscus is one of the commonest anatomical variations of the meniscus.	0.8399160553864058
There is at the moment no consensus on the aetiology of discoid meniscus.	0.9226401037712751
According to Watanabe three types can be differentiated: the complete form, the incomplete form and the hypermobile Wrisberg form.	1.0695735503734507
Discoid meniscus frequently remains asymptomatic and thus requires no treatment.	0.7203683734654328
Partial meniscectomy is recommended for treatment of the stable form, while for the unstable forms total meniscectomy is generally regarded as the treatment of choice, since the instability means that rupture of residual meniscus would be possible.	1.2821088857241218
A fourteen years old girl showed the classic signs of acrocephalosyndactyly I: dysostosis craniofacialis with hypertelorism, exophthalmus, strabism, amblyopia and cleft palate as well as syndactyly of the fingers and toes.	0.8981215022870469
The feet showed on both side a 6  cm long horny band.	0.8479431918883035
Since the twelfth year of life, she had suffered from papulo-pustular acne with many comedomes.	0.842197860950453
Her menstruation started one year later.	0.7063861929982328
At time of her birth, her father was 54 years old, and her mother 36 years old.	0.9567716556368975
Two elder siblings are healthy.	0.4497496912673216
The inheritance of acrocephalosyndactyly I is usually autosomal dominant, but sporadic cases are frequent.	1.0348502182624042
Objective: Cognitive dysfunction is a known problem after operations and may be especially relevant in the elderly.	1.1170218322909702
The aim of this international multicentre study was to investigate short- and long-term cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients and to elucidate the relevance of hypoxaemia and hypotension as causative factors.	1.1959738646848888
Autosomal recessive inheritance, intrauterine growth retardation, short stature, microcephaly, distinct facial dysmorphism, psychomotoric retardation, and often uncharacterized eczematous skin lesions distinguish the rare Dubowitz syndrome.	0.9432580960928149
Here a pair of monozygotic twins with Dubowitz syndrome and clear-cut atopic eczema is presented.	0.7798342985603579
Humeral shaft fractures can be treated either conservatively or operatively.	0.8670670094557678
Plating of the humerus is the established operative method, but recently interest has also been focussed on intramedullary nailing.	1.0855286770867894
Fifty-nine cases of humeral fractures treated with intramedullary nailing (Seidel/Marchetti-Vicenzi/Prévot) from January 1991 to December 1995 (44 fractures after trauma, 11 pathological fractures, 3 pseudarthroses, 1 re-fracture).	1.130065782630485
Closed reduction in 55/59 cases.	0.6830747229515641
One infection (soft tissue); 2/48 pseudarthrosis (indication for nailing: pseudarthrosis!).	0.9783679099714898
No iatrogenic palsy of the radial nerve.	0.7579630414596514
Functional postoperative treatment in all 44 cases of humeral fractures after adequate trauma.	0.9271538479747992
One poor functional result: periarticular ossification after retrograde nailing, possibly connected with long-term respiratory treatment after trauma.	0.9337213592943073
Treatment of humeral shaft fractures by intramedullary nailing is favoured in our clinic (low complication rates, excellent or good functional results, limited approaches, small scars).	1.136580908612332
Proximal fractures should be treated by the Seidel nail (stable interlocking of the proximal fragment); very distal fractures need Prévot nailing (reaming of condylar canals).	1.024696586330328
All other fractures of the humeral shaft can be treated by each of the implants used in our clinic.	1.2497142957279292
Pathological fractures are an excellent indication for intramedullary stabilization.	0.8671443539413627
These patients benefit from stable fixation without intense surgical trauma.	0.6849021990751204
Pseudarthrosis, according to our limited experience, seems to require plating plus bone grafting.	0.886902388603116
Plating is also recommended if revision of the radial nerve becomes necessary.	0.8698504046552791
2-4 % of vascular injuries need operative reconstruktion.	1.1718000905792345
In polytraumatized patients the rate is even 10 %.	0.8882567095730484
Arterial vascular repair should precede venous reconstruction and orthopaedic stabilization due to limb threatening ischemia.	0.7575856664074986
Penetration or blunt vascular trauma result either in acute blood loss, ischemia or compartmental compression.	0.9318681204181382
Reperfusion syndrom leads to vital threat of patient.	0.6132349804505465
Clinical assessment, measurement of limb pressures using a Doppler device and use of duplex ultrasonography are reliable adjuncts in the rapid evaluation.	0.8525998962858092
Arteriography is rarely indicated and should be spared for patients with abnormal physical examination.	0.8448792333112898
Minimizing ischemia (6-8 h) is an important factor in maximizing limb salvage.	1.2502536735334508
Vascular repair include direct anastomosis or lateral suture repair mostly combined with primary shortening of the extremity.	0.8746696739307257
In most cases autogenous vein graft is required.	0.7600134622154213
Rethrombosis, arteriovenous fistula and pseudoaneurysms are possible complications.	0.7470706266266379
Stabilisation of the fracture has priority over vascular reconstruction.	0.9025902404582569
The initial steps to success are surgical debridement, adequate bony stabilization mostly by external fixation, revascularisation of vascular injury, immediate fascial decompression and early soft-tissue reconstruction.	0.9051977311251587
The best results are obtained when a multidiciplinary approach is used combining expertise in orthopedic surgery, vascular surgery and plastic surgery.	0.9885747067213592
In secondary prevention, statins are cost-effective and even more cost-effective than other lipid lowering drugs.	0.9567763517971938
Statins are especially favorable in patients with previous myocardial infarction compared to those with angina pectoris.	0.9977636748909724
For secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, statins should be administered generously.	0.8245043193075599
In primary prevention, statins are effective but not cost-efficient.	0.8506243608586201
Unfavorable results have to be expected especially in premenopausal women, younger patients, and in those with a low risk factor profile.	1.2001331503665715
For population based primary prevention, only dietary measures can be advocated; however, apart from a serious lack of compliance their efficiency has not yet been proven.	1.1277557370307496
Preventive measures have their own prize; in general they are considered not to prevent coronary heart disease but retard it.	1.0558974102333425
Therefore, such therapeutic interventions can be assumed not to reduce but rather to increase the "direct" medical costs.	1.3731501662579961
Furthermore, successful prevention of coronary heart disease leads, due to life-prolongation, to an increase in people out of work and in disabled patients due to age and/or disease.	1.1599977656476896
Therefore, an increase especially of the "indirect" costs for unemployment, pension, nursing homes, etc.	1.1013226172884285
Background: There are three fields where the the biochemical cardiac markers creatine kinase (CK), its isoenzyme MB (CK-MB), myoglobin, and troponin can play an important role: (1) the primary diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), (2) identification of patients suffering from unstable angina with minor myocardial damage (MMD) and consecutively increased risk for major cardiovascular events, and (3) assessment of coronary reperfusion after intravenous thrombolysis.	1.2735017483127842
MRSA/MRSE infections are a major problem in hospitals and although in orthopaedic units the incidence is low awareness of this problem is necessary.	1.0311745583286884
Once a MRSA strain has been isolated the strict use of the hygiene precautions has to be applied to avoid epidemic spread of the strain.	0.9984404102072804
The patient has to be isolated.	0.6624289517782167
The staff has to use gloves and gowns whilst treating the patient.	0.7480500112849627
A antimicrobiel hand wash solution has to be used after taking off the gloves and before leaving the isolation room.	0.9234771354082189
Patient and staff have to be informed about the pathogenity and the way of infection spread so that infection precaution rules are fulfilled.	0.9959501796509302
Antibiotics should only be used in clinically well defined cases and the overall use of antibiotics should be reduced to lower the incidence of MRSA/E isolates.	1.1605704693898053
The problems of an MRSA case and its successful treatment are demonstrated.	0.9003292533182488
A microphone constructed for implantation in the posterior wall of the auditory canal and a piezoelectric transducer serving as the main components of an implantable hearing aid were temporally implanted in five patients during middle ear surgery under local anesthesia.	1.0031058564017208
The microphone was positioned beneath the skin of the auditory canal such that it completely covered the microphone membrane.	0.8845206913407448
The vibratory element of the transducer was coupled to the malleus in four patients with normal ossicular chains and directly to the stapes in one patient with missing incus.	1.0781259247921602
The microphone and transducer were electrically connected with an external battery-driven signal amplifier.	0.8806687304217692
Speech material and music were presented in the operation room at a sound level of 65 dB SPL under free-field conditions.	0.9579557115026871
The patients had to estimate the quality of speech, music, and their own voice as well as the effects of bone-conducting noises.	1.3712093980005267
All patients were able to hear with the system.	0.7830732278992361
An intraoperative talk without vision contact was possible without any problems, as was understanding of numerals ("Freiburger Zahlentest").	1.1179296329740585
Perception of music was judged as "clear and undistorted with all broadband component."	0.8362358337178981
The estimation was also valid for one patient with a sensorineural hearing loss.	1.0532134680326863
One patient declared the music to be "a little of unnatural."	0.9004229977876778
Bone-conducted sound was estimated as normal in two patients, better than without an implant in one patient with sensorineural hearing loss, and "somewhat metallic" in another patient.	1.1966019681782738
Hearing the own voice was considered "normal" in two cases "monotonous" in one case, and "a little bit roaring" in another case.	1.2395055034241205
An amplification factor that can be technically realized in an implantable hearing aid was necessary for one of the patients with sensorineural hearing loss to perceive music at a pleasant volume.	1.0531056219597619
On the basis of this study, essential requirements for the construction of a fully implantable hearing aid are fulfilled.	1.265969451680173
We report a patient with metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) with a first manifestation of homicide.	1.2103335184164463
On admission the patient showed a hebephrenia-like syndrom with inappropriate affect, thought disorder and  behavioral changes.	0.8954242613609278
Magnetic resonance  tomography (MRT) findings suggested a  diagnosis of MLD, which was confirmed by a decreased activity of leucocyte arylsulfatase A and an excessive urinary sulfatide excretion.	1.1252955947062828
The cervical spondylotic myelopathy is the most frequent spinal dysfunction.	0.9464859536037286
Its spontaneous course is very variable, from progress to stagnation.	0.9719224642521783
This makes prognosis and decision-making difficult for conservative or operative treatment.	0.7965223722536449
The authors attempt to provide some basis for decision-making by observing the individual course of neural dysfunction, consideration of morphometric data and the use of functional scores.	0.9325248585712596
To advise a patient, the outcome of conservative and operative treatment as described in the literature has to be considered, as well as the possible complications.	1.291490983374396
The advantages and disadvantages of surgery from the anterior and posterior approach are discussed.	0.8762739172697439
Operative planning according to the individual condition is suggested.	1.0094933132559343
Operative techniques of anterior decompression and fusion are contrasted to laminoplasties.	0.7881339457627945
Subject: In a 7;11 year old boy with trichotillomania (ICD-10 F63.3), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (ICD-10 F90.1), and subclinical minimal cerebral dysfunction, Methylphenidate (Ritalin) medication resulted in a remarkable improvement: unexspected interruption of trichotillomania with regrowth of hair.	1.1176759396593194
An essential feature of the known procedures for the analysis of the ECG signal is the splitting of the ECG into individual parameters which are subsequently processed in defined decision trees, neuronal networks or statistical procedures to diagnostic information.	0.995257768737803
The correctness of the diagnostic statements thus substantially depends on the suitable selection and the exact determination of the individual criteria.	1.0691152858562287
The analysis algorithm and the expert knowledge are closely linked due to the procedure.	0.8633109043866476
This paper presents a new procedure or the evaluation of signals of medical sensor systems by the example of the ECG.	1.0816281787332434
Unlike the methods used up to now, this procedure is not based on an ever more profound splitting of the ECG signal into individual features.	1.118002560910993
Furthermore, analysis algorithm and knowledge base are separated from each other.	1.2021871072278363
The consideration underlying the procedure is that two ECGs whose leads show identical or very similar signal patterns indicate identical or at least very similar cardiological diagnoses.	0.9321657869977924
As this assumption is the basis of medical experience, it should be possible to compare the signal patterns of the leads of an unknown ECG with those of the leads of the reference ECGs from a database and to draw conclusions for the diagnosis of the unknown ECG.	1.1610983990332087
For this purpose, those ECGs are searched in an ECG database whose leads show greatest agreement with the signal pattern of the unknown ECG.	0.8801439713331617
The function of the method was established with the aid of the ECG signal database CARDIODAT with 249 ECGs for the diagnostic groups: infarcts and healthy reference persons from a data inventory of 550 ECGs.	1.0261324184998113
It can be seen from the results that the presented procedure which is based on signal pattern recognition is a new approach to deriving diagnostic information from the ECG signal at least for the diagnostic group of myocardial infarcts.	1.2156401133789179
Purpose: The technical conditions, the optimized scanning protocols and the facilities of virtual endoscopy (VE) are presented in an overview.	1.1565953877200836
During a 4-week ambulatory cardiacc rehabilitation program, 262 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), 235 men and 27 women, 53.6+/-10.2 years, performed 30.5+/-2,9 exercise units.	1.1808809856812008
Before and after the rehabilitation program exercise, capacity was assessed by bicycle ergometry.	0.920910718896166
There was a significant (p<0.001) increase in the maximum exercise capacity at the end of the program (105.3+/-32.3 vs. 121.9+/-37.3 W).	1.1354868725153142
Physical work capacity on the 2.0 mmol lactate level improved (p<0.001) from 72.2+/-23.5 to 86.4+/-25.8 W, on the 2.5 mmol/l level (p<0.001) from 83.5+/-23.2 to 97.4+/-26.4 W, and on the 3.0 mmol/l level (p<0.001) from 93.1+/-23.0 to 106.6+/-26.1 W. Despite enhanced performance, heart rate remained unaltered on the 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 mmol/l lactate level.	1.1820983854640332
Furthermore, ergometric performance on predefined heart rate levels was significantly (p<0.001) increased: 85/min: from 56.0+/-24.1 to 65.8+/-24.5 W; 90/min: from 62.0+/-27.3 to 71.2+/-26 W; 95/min: from 67.2+/-26.4 to 77.5+/-27.6 W; 100/min: from 71.1+/-29.6 to 80.6+/-28.1 W; 105/min: from 69.8+/-26.2 to 81.9+/-28.2 W and 110/min: from 73.6+/-28.9 to 90.4+/-29.4 W. The results demonstrate that physical performance in patients with CAD was improved by our novel ambulatory cardiac rehabilitation program.	1.211613281157969
This improvement included an increase in maximum as well as endurance work capacity; furthermore, this increase was accompanied by a decrease in resting and exercise heart rates.	1.0171029022015776
The results demonstrate an absolute increase of physical performance, more importantly an increase of physical performance at defined lactate levels in the presence of unchanged heart rates mediated by the rehabilitation program.	1.0863921533663177
Thus, this increase was independent of motivational factors in the patients and/or the investigators during the re-exercise test.	1.261260318229625
On the contrary, our data demonstrate that it is based on an improvement of aerobic endurance capacity associated with a therapeutically beneficial significant decrease of heart rate for a defined workload.	1.1271883832956366
The effects were independent of pharmacological influences (e.g., -receptor antagonists).	1.0906146523854832
These findings are of clinical importance with respect to reduction of myocardial oxygen consumption in patients with CAD.	1.0844496506754493
Newborn screening programs for inborn errors of metabolism are well established in industrialized countries.	0.855144763067248
Missed cases may be not only due to errors in specimen collection and laboratory errors but also to failures in adequate follow up.	0.9052759152023366
We report the case of a now 4-year-old girl whose classical phenylketonuria was diagnostically missed in the course of follow-up procedures of a pathological screening result 1067 µmol/l 17,6 mg% phenylalanine.	1.0666227270043802
The separation of whole blood into components is the state-of-the-art in transfusion of allogeneic blood.	0.9377885655715353
The main reasons are the negative effects of the buffy coat and the need for FFP.	0.9293424391839868
Nevertheless, especially in Germany whole blood is being rejected more and more even as autologous blood.	1.2647672615781267
However, most of the negative effects of the buffy coat do not apply to autologous blood.	1.0074011995547096
Additionally, these patients usually do not develop coagulation disorders and therefore do not need plasma as a hemostatic component.	1.1174344683851005
On the other hand, separation into components of autologous blood leads to an increase of costs and to logistic problems that restrict autologous blood predeposit to a few institutions.	0.9319825193859622
Therefore, we have reviewed the literature in order to find a scientific basis for this.	1.3643185057106573
We analysed all articles listed by MEDLINE during the last 12 years that dealt with the quality of whole blood or red cell concentrates.	0.9576750466272036
In addition, all references were included that contributed relevant information to the topic.	1.1768699893907089
A total of 135 original articles, abstracts, reviews, letters or editorials were analysed that referred to standard preparations and storage media.	0.8775777962865032
In 48 papers the in vivo red cell survival was studied.	0.8144749370560483
28 of which fulfilled the prerequisites to be included into a meta-analysis.	0.9939840966294761
The following in vitro parameters were also evaluated: pH, potassium load of the units, ATP and DPG concentration of the red cells.	1.037404066525304
Whole blood (resuspended in CPDA-1) and red cell units (stabilized in CPDA-1 or additive solutions) with a different buffy coat or leucocyte content have comparable pH values and red cell 2,3-DPG and ATP concentrations at the end of the approved storage time.	0.9936735200566326
The potassium load of a whole blood unit appears to be higher than red cell concentrates, but this is to some extent caused by the higher plasma content of whole blood and is not thought to be a clinically relevant problem for patients receiving only a few units.	1.2236695248711165
A number of studies demonstrate that dependent upon the leucocyte content of a red cell unit, leucocyte metabolites and enzymes are released and accumulate during storage.	0.8548762310178383
A detrimental influence on the integrity of the red cell membrane was found in several in vitro studies.	1.1334004741672292
Nevertheless, a significant improvement in red cell survival by leucocyte reduction was detected by only one group.	1.3213095436246123
Undoubtedly, non-hemolytic febrile transfusion reactions (NHFTR) are generally caused by an antibody-antigen interaction due to the transfusion of allogeneic buffy coat.	0.995662320143024
On the other hand, there is some evidence that non-specific immunological mechanisms such as the release of histamine or cytokines are also capable of causing NHFTR.	1.0273489736593788
Thus, these reactions are expected to occur in autologous blood transfusion.	1.265963330109738
However, so far, there are no data about the frequency and severity of these reactions and whether they are more likely to emerge after transfusion of blood units with a particular preparation.	1.34044607978258
Blood transfusions can cause septic complications due to bacterial contamination of the transfused units.	0.7957040268236769
These fatal but rare complications may be reduced by pre-storage filtration of blood, but there is no indication that buffy coat reduction is effective.	1.0459027447264573
Three cases with septic complications have been reported after autologous transfusion, in two of which red cell concentrates (at least one was free of buffy coat) had been used.	1.318472176714893
Thus, there is no justification for the conclusion that the risk of septic complications is increased by transfusion of whole blood.	1.1689436914530915
After all, whole blood and red cell concentrates exhibit only minor differences in relevant in vitro parameters.	0.9593985915452967
Hence, a higher incidence of adverse effects following the transfusion of autologous whole blood compared to autologous red cell concentrations is unlikely.	1.0551681288923562
Therefore, the 24 h in vivo recovery is considered to be the most valid criterion to assess the quality of red cell preparations.	1.112844528422395
Physical therapy can support geriatric rehabilitation in contributing to better health status, mobility, and quality of life.	0.8329169387585135
However, the central focus of this contribution is not on illness-specific aspects of physical therapy but on power and stamina training.	1.0935608943827284
These two training methods are of special importance for geriatric rehabilitation since most patients are admitted due to related problems and these two methods do imply specific risk factors for the rehabilitation process.	1.1129381067049904
The spectrum of physical adaptation processes supported by power and stamina training is described and scientifically evaluated.	0.8809417294472437
Even in higher age groups positive training effects are possible.	0.7410125287547559
Adequate usage of these training methods contributes to increased competence and a minimization of risks in daily life.	0.8608000455183609
The arthroscopic extraarticular Bankart procedure tries to imitate the open Bankart procedure.	0.6380855255862828
An anterior-inferior transmuscular approach through the subscapular muscle permits to implant self-locking tacks into the anterior inferior third of the glenoid rim.	0.8859143849467122
The extraarticular location of the implants makes a superomedial capsular shift possible, if required.	1.05534981461301
A total of 257 arthroscopic repairs following traumatic recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation have been carried out between 1992 and 1996.	0.879118220462197
177 patients were treated only with bioabsorbable Suretac device.	0.9030240933226332
Clinical and radiological follow up was possible in 165 patients.	0.9896833854727585
According to the Rowe score 69,7 % were classified as excellent, 10,9 % as good, 9,7 % fair and 9,7 % poor.	1.2150415347184207
Postoperative complications: the recurrence rate was 9,7 %, allergic reactions representing a foreign body reaction to the synthetic material were seen in 5 cases (3 %) and a frozen shoulder in 6 cases 3,6 %).	1.186375759534691
61 % of the patients involved in overhead or contact sports returned to their preoperative sport activities.	1.0062102298169164
Contrast-enhanced 3D MR angiography permits comprehensive assessment of the arterial system in the chest, abdomen und lower extremities.	1.0140626971777593
The method combines intravenous bolus application of a non-nephrotoxic, paramagnetic, extracellular contrast agent with the acquisition of a fast 3D data set.	0.9260900986670468
High contrast between the vascular lumen and surrounding tissues, inherent three-dimensionality and the ability to collect image data in the chest and abdomen under apnea conditions all contribute to excellent image quality.	0.9768275551632731
Contrast-enhanced 3D MRA is being employed in many centers throughout the world for the evaluation of various arterial pathologies.	0.946175719516711
This review provides a technical overview and critically discusses the clinical applications in the chest, abdomen and lower extremities based upon the available literature and several clincial examples.	1.0289239719434038
The indications for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on prosthetic heart valve recipients remain critical.	0.8236573178733106
A generalized contraindication for MRI is doubtful.	0.6457453122266608
Some diagnostic questions such as interests in pathologies of the posterior cranial fossa, spinal abscesses, and internal derangements for the knee, strongly recommend the advantages of MRI versus all other radiological diagnostic techniques.	1.103827260818809
MRI can directly affect patients with prosthetic valves in three ways by: 1) movement or dislodgment of the prosthesis, 2) heating, and 3) arrhythmias induced by electric currents, and indirectly by distortion of the image and its subsequent misinterpretation.	1.1969734324315813
Present literature that concerns the safety considerations of current values appears to be incomplete.	0.7869778589395812
Therefore, a survey of twenty-five valve manufacturers with regard to compatibility, safety or contraindication for MRI on their respective prosthetic heart valves was performed in 1998.	1.1856656894902196
Those manufacturers who distribute most of the valves in Europe confirmed the safety of MRI.	0.9106996496658535
However, some gave their assurances based on inadequate data, or assigned all responsibility to the physician.	1.2135477860842883
Some companies did not give any assurance for MRI safety or failed to respond to our enquiry.	0.8363571570792617
Two valve manufacturers warned against performing MRI on certain prostheses.	0.6824553472218899
Based on our 1998 questionnaire, the technical issues, the clinical circumstances, the prerequisites and criteria for and the definition of safety standards for MRI on prosthetic heart valve recipients are presented in this paper.	1.2621457343582938
Argyrophilic grain disease (AGD) is a frequently occurring degenerative illness of the aging human brain.	1.1055936035554204
It is accompanied by progressive pathological alterations of the cytsokeleton which are traceable to an abnormal phosphorylation of the microtubule associated tau protein.	0.8081872585702272
Histologically, it is possible with the help of suitable staining techniques to identify pathognomonic spindle-shaped cellular inclusions (argyrophilic grains).	1.1356479056299338
These cellular inclusions display a typical cortical as well as subcortical distribution pattern.	0.8165917227750795
The goal of the present study is the retrospective evaluation of the clinical findings from 53 individuals with neuropathologically demonstrable AGD-related changes of the brain.	1.2253318585000879
Nearly one-half of the cases (49%) was classifiable as demented in accordance with DSM IV-criteria.	1.045299334769122
Moreover, the frequency of the dementia increased significantly in relation to the growing severity of the AGD-associated pathological cytoskeletal degeneration.	1.091208026957518
These results confirm the assumption that AGD can cause degenerative changes ranging from cognitive impairment all the way to dementia.	0.9100826196643736
They also underscore the necessity of further prospective studies pertaining to the clinical aspects of this still enigmatic disease.	0.9495416459476624
The major problems in the treatment of open fractures with high blood loss are hypothermia acidosis and coagulopathy.	0.9611329145446142
By improving the standards of polytrauma management and using massive transfusion systems, which should help to avoid those complications, the indication for primary limb salvage under hypovolemic shock conditions is greatly increased.	1.070064254986048
The following case of an grade 3 open fracture of the femur with severe soft-tissue damage, including vascular lesions, with consecutive massive transfusion, should demonstrate that the cardiac-respiratory system can still be stabilized, even if a surgical solution seems impossible.	1.2374564975731963
Annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma is mostly found in middle aged women in skin areas exposed to sunlight.	0.8123343940504719
Our 17-year-old female patient had a widespread reddish-brown lesion on the abdomen that met the histological criteria for annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma.	0.9653958225012963
However, the clinical findings and the localization were uncommon.	1.33171917250562
UV light was excluded as a trigger.	0.739525812189091
Other, still unknown, factors that might change antigenicity of elastic fibres must be considered.	0.9633243233039697
Spontaneous resolution suggests a transient influence of such factors.	0.7819493092733799
Differential diagnosis includes skin disorders with elastolysis; discrimination especially from mid-dermal elastolysis is not well defined.	0.8880810013909507
Traumatic instability of the sternoclavicular joint is a rare diagnosis.	0.9168653484397232
It is usually treated by different bandaging techniques without the possibility of early functional aftercare.	0.9150664808274406
In the period betweeen 1 January 1996 and 31 December 1998, a total of eight patients with unstable sternoclavicular joints requiring surgical treatment were treated with Balser plates.	1.109511044451797
The population comprised sevenanterior and one posterior dislocations.	0.636274806332368
A 81-year-old man presented with massive hemoptysis and dyspnea.	0.8195699620088627
Results of chest radiography and computer tomography were highly suspicious for a large right-sided tumor of the bronchus with impression of the right main bronchus.	1.0990992644389945
Because of clinical worsening the patient was transferred to our department of pulmonology.	1.0308764014470968
The patient died of unappeasable hemoptysis the next day.	0.8058600831950347
At autopsy we found a 2-cm-diameter tumor of the proximal trachea as the source of massive bleeding and blood aspiration.	1.1359827879532722
Histological examination confirmed the tumor to be an epithelioid angiosarcoma of the trachea, which was a primary as no other tumor manifestation was detected.	1.2253016371045693
The entity of epithelioid angiosarcoma as a primary tumor of the trachea, to our knowledge, has not yet been reported.	1.0734341377699286
The benefits of epidural analgesia are well known, but it is not well understood which types of urologic surgery benefit most from epidural analgesia.	1.0710179536137279
In this study, the effects and side effects of prolonged epidural analgesia are prospectively examined and analysed on 172 adult patients in three different operation groups.	1.058068479019849
An epidural infusion of local anaesthetic combined with an opioid and adrenaline was given for a period of 5-7 days.	1.2110185271587388
There was no difference between the groups with respect to the effectiveness of the analgesia and patients' perception of the treatment.	1.1688145600090223
Mobilization differed, as expected, between the groups, however even after the most major surgery (e. g. cystectomy with bladder substitution), mobilization was impressively unproblematic.	1.339291023821715
Retarded return of regular intestinal function after the transperitoneal operation and partly after lumbotomy compared with the extraperitoneal operation depended on which operation was performed and the amount of analgesia given.	0.9799321766205553
The side effects such as sedation, nausea and pruritis were conditional partly on the opiate and partly on the intervention.	0.8232032378732594
Up to 11 % showed slight muscular weakness of the lower limbs as a specific side effect of the local anaesthetic.	1.3405137743491888
Complications: One patient died of cerebral hypoxy due to an initially undetected subdural catheter placement complicated by severe pre-existent carotid stenosis.	1.0068452189413333
In four patients, the epidural analgesia had to be stopped because of catheter migration.	1.0802697341329022
There was no clinical evidence of hematoma, abscess or permanent neurological damage.	0.9120159266925562
Epidural analgesia works well in terms of analgesia, mobilization and patient satisfaction, bearing in mind the potential side effects and complications.	0.9365927359895221
It can be recommended for lumbotomy and long transperitoneal operations however not for extraperitoneal interventions in the lower abdomen such as radical prostatectomy.	1.0279390921162326
High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) provides excellent contrast between osseous structures, air and soft tissue in conjunction with high spatial resolution.	0.8635305937880088
Therefore, thin-section HRCT with bone window setting is the method of choice for the examination of the middle ear structures.	1.1388444997440246
The indications are acute and chronic inflammatory changes, cholesteatoma and tumor, the "postoperative middle ear", and malformations.	1.10133598454854
In most cases, HRCT enables differentiation between inflammatory changes, cholesteatoma, and tumor.	0.8160881186921177
The excellent depiction of subtle osseous details enables the identification of erosions of the ossicles or of the bony walls of the mastoid cells, of osseous defects of the tegmen, of the bony labyrinth, and of the tympanic course of the facial canal.	1.257576787147281
In addition, HRCT enables excellent depiction of reconstructions of the ossicles or prosthesis of the ossicles.	1.0669749906622183
Although HRCT is the first method of choice, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may provide additional information and lead to a more accurate diagnosis in some cases.	1.1104443079841433
This is explained by the excellent soft tissue contrast provided by MRI.	0.9008415177862267
In addition, MRI offers the possibility of using various pulse sequences and the administration of IV contrast material.	0.9921667406216812
Therefore, MRI may allow the differentiation between inflammatory changes, cholesteatoma, and tumor in those cases in which accurate diagnosis cannot be made by HRCT.	1.1812500974024875
The differentiation between a meningocele or meningoencephalocele and other entities such as tumors or cholesteatoma can be established by MRI.	0.8749165866715567
Furthermore, MRI can accurately depict cases of labyrinthitis or of neuritis of the facial nerve or of intracranial disease caused by middle ear processes, while this is not always possible by HRCT.	1.2549632069789138
Morbidity and mortality after emergency procedures in 105 patients with perforated colonic diverticulitis were evaluated in a retrospective study.	1.0276749156079088
In different stages of diverticulitis (Hinchey classification: I, 8.6 %; II, 14.3 %; III, 57.1 %; IV, 20.0 %) mortality was 12.4 %.	1.238275284103406
Preoperative sepsis syndrome with leucopenia and disturbed liver function, cardiac risk factors and obesity were independent prognostic factors in multiple logistic regression.	1.0432305975983907
Accompanied by immunosuppression the mortality rate remarkably increased to 33 %.	0.8189715092305748
The stage of peritonitis showed no influence on the prognosis.	0.8531060368106949
In multivariate analysis, surgical procedure (primary resection 12.4 %, Hartmann's procedure 61.9 %, non-resection procedures 25.7 %) showed influence only on increased general complications.	1.2003984438076274
The role of laparoscopic cholecystectomy on patients with histologically confirmed acute cholecystitis is still controversial.	0.9437251839708268
From January 1992 to December 1996, 228 cholecystectomies were performed for acute cholecystitis and a total of 104 patients were operated on conventionally and 124 patients underwent laparoscopic surgery.	0.966396322437458
In a prospective study we compared the conventional with the laparoscopic technique.	0.9560997212521107
The results indicated that in 19 patients (15.3 %) treated initially with the laparoscopic technique, a switch to laparotomy was required.	1.1634062206927394
The operating duration was lower for conventional cholecystectomy (75 min versus 95 min).	0.9661126020799559
However, surgical and nonsurgical complication rates were similar in both groups.	1.3069292411757762
The period of hospitalization was shorter in laparoscopic operations.	0.8842080937624004
According to these results we believe that laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with acute cholecystitis is a safe and effective procedure.	1.0269045525970024
The patients will benefit from the advantages of laparoscopic surgery without increased morbidity.	0.8830659748924035
The sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) is one of the most striking developments in the treatment of melanoma.	1.118199117497319
Since the first report by Morton et al.	0.9867458973054273
in 1992, the method has been refined, and its use has increased.	1.3010878784352797
Introduced as an alternative to elective lymph node dissection (ELND), it has rapidly made its way into clinical practice.	1.115535081075017
SLND allows precise pathologic staging through removal and analysis of a limited number of nodes (false-negative rate < 2 %).	1.0215349211918403
It distinguishes patients with clinically occult nodal disease from those with tumor-free regional basin who would not benefit from radical dissection.	0.9529935387180913
However, the SLND is still an experimental procedure with yet unproven utility.	1.0679632028612085
Although children are injured everyday through accidents, road traffic, leisure or sports activities, internal lesions of the knee joint due to the trauma are rare.	0.98922363786066
Diagnose and therapy follow rather empirical than analytical patterns.	0.6793057486598583
A retrospective, controlled study evaluates and recommends ways of treatment.	0.9083170774618898
Traumatic internal lesions of the knee where analysed in 76 children up to age 16.	0.9669683464985619
The pattern of injury changed with increasing age, the trauma remaining the same.	0.9849861605932184
Most common where injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).	0.6534030076798206
Main cause where sports activities.	0.5045729772561781
Operative treatment seems to be the appropriate treatment.	1.027659143967871
Osseous avulsions of the cruciates and collateral ligaments showed good results after transosseous refixation with a suture.	0.8356659756994956
Suturing of intraligamentous ACL-ruptures as well as patellar ligaments plasty showed unsatisfactory results.	0.7754384772023513
Secondary lesions due to instability of the knee where also observed in children.	1.0259504242666109
