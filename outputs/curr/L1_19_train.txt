In the Commission, systems and structures have built up over forty years in which successive enlargements have occurred.	1.0156482835192537
The treaties have been revised, new managerial tasks have been attributed by this Parliament and by the Council to the Commission, and many other changes of great significance have occurred in our Union, in our continent and in the world.	1.520334278408754
Those realities, together with the approach of further enlargements, all counsel strongly for modernisation of the Commission, so that this essential institution can fulfil its primary tasks of policy conception and development, of treaty application and of management of the public resources and do so with maximum effectiveness, maximum responsibility and maximum accountability.	1.2701931230236663
The sustained independence and strength of the Commission are, of course, basic to that mission as this House has repeatedly recognised.	1.2759524283168688
Reform and renewal are essential for that purpose too.	0.8999956626715878
The Commission is not and will not be a secretariat of any kind, and that is clear to all of the institutions - it is well understood everywhere.	1.7397907306134295
But the Commission does exist to serve the Union and its peoples with high standards of performance.	1.384646299787017
That is what the public has the right to expect and it is what the people who work for the Commission want to provide and will provide.	1.4024176623836921
The House will be aware, of course, that the Commission cannot fulfil these objectives alone.	1.2589229519330472
All institutions in the European Union will have to face up to the issues posed by the reform and face up to them honestly and responsibly.	1.1392599801860341
I know that my colleagues and I can count on the support of many Members of this House across the spectrum.	1.3241459054822806
One of the biggest challenges that may come from the essential efforts to match the tasks of the Commission with the resources of the Commission will confront this House.	1.538315633971823
Last month, as Romano Prodi has just said, we launched a thorough evaluation of activities and resources throughout the Commission and we will fully report on that in September.	1.3742443842587948
Our aim is to focus the Commission on essential policy priorities and on core activities in line with our strategic policy objectives for the next five years.	1.1278022248542707
Inevitably, that will mean identifying activities that could and should be reduced or ended.	1.3825855264526474
It means taking a very hard look at how the use of internal and external resources can be most effectively balanced in the interest of the Union.	1.0286002524347642
It means allocating staff to areas of high-policy importance within departments and across the Commission.	0.8592673736077135
And when that assessment is complete, we will be able to establish whether the resources at our disposal are commensurate with the tasks attributed to us.	1.1953952540958466
If they are proven not to be, we will put the case for more resources to the budgetary authority.	1.467351185625201
If that does not meet with a positive response, the difficult issue of which of our lower-priority activities should be discontinued will then have to be addressed, not just by the Commission, but by this Parliament and by the Council too.	1.3819480299628983
I do not make this point because of any desire in the Prodi Commission to retreat from activities or responsibilities.	1.1849097777264266
On the contrary, as many in this House understand, I am setting out these considerations because we want to meet our responsibilities and meet them with full effectiveness and full accountability.	1.4839940094201496
That means closing any significant gap between obligations and operational resources either by reducing activities or by increasing means or by a combination of both.	0.8674742634891884
In each of the three pillars of reform, the active support and cooperation of this House will be absolutely vital.	1.2767485227222068
The new activity-based management system, that the President just mentioned, will link political priorities to the availability of resources and consequently to the budget for the first time.	1.4316545864450625
The role of the budgetary authority in the operation of ABM will, therefore, be vital.	1.1778364447503167
Attempts to micro-manage the Commission' s operations are clearly in no one' s interest.	1.0479936890338966
A resilient and practical interinstitutional agreement will, therefore, be a prerequisite for the efficient operation of activity-based management.	1.0437427559696983
In human resources policy, the involvement of Parliament will unavoidably have to be as an employer of civil servants as well as a democratic institution to which the Commission is accountable.	1.4448282196785407
Again, that will be a very demanding challenge.	1.4566558012753958
And finally, in the crucial area of financial management where the Court of Auditors, the Committee of Independent Experts and other external and internal analyses have strongly advised radical change, the support of this House in implementing the recommendations for full security of money and value for money will be of prime importance.	1.3550390645638828
In the limited time available for this statement, it is obviously impossible to go into the full details of our proposals.	1.2208811824461263
I have no doubt that we will do that on several occasions in the coming months and years, and I certainly look forward to the questions of honourable Members this afternoon.	1.432482935650692
It is clear, of course, that in many ways the really hard work starts now, with the implementation of our proposals.	1.5266537325095908
I look forward to working with this Parliament, with the Council and with the staff of the institutions to ensure that the reform strategy is put fully into effect for the benefit of the Union and for the advantage of all of its peoples.	1.549015565339618
Thank you, Commissioner Kinnock.	0.9727683663971937
We shall now move on to Question Time.	0.9055197217122346
Madam President, the Commission proposals include the waiver of immunity of officials.	1.350196197673631
Recently, the immunity of a former Commissioner was lifted and proceedings are currently pending before a judge in Brussels on the basis that Brussels is the seat of the Community institutions.	1.138848452726178
Yet these institutions have other seats and, given that the Community' s actions affect the whole Community territory, there are in fact thousands of courts which could judge officials, Commissioners and so on.	1.307682294343882
Is the Commission aware that, in order to lift immunity, it would be necessary to adopt a new legal instrument to regulate the procedure for holding Commission officials accountable, including former and current Commissioners?	1.2998770348013768
There is effective legal precaution.	0.7232433128311104
In the particular case that the honourable Member has in mind, not only did the Commission easily and quickly come to a decision to waive the immunity of a former Commissioner, but the former Commissioner herself advised the Commission of her desire that the immunity should be lifted.	1.3666965902841945
I can see the complexities that concern the honourable Member, but I say to him that in the last five years there have been ten cases in which there have been requests from national legal authorities for the immunity of 26 officials to be lifted, and every single one of those requests has been met, and met with alacrity.	1.4075032564451047
I think that the House can therefore be confident that not only are the civil rights of individuals who may be accused or required to produce evidence safeguarded, but so is the interest of the properly constituted legal bodies of every Member State in seeking to get information, or the right to interview or investigate anybody associated with the Commission.	1.2587675726319116
As the Parliament' s rapporteur on the staff elements of your report, Mr Kinnock, I very much welcome the fact that we are now starting the process, and if I may say to all colleagues here, we have a very important task to do, which will be absolutely central to the future of the Commission and its effectiveness.	1.5952309591408516
And I make the point, before I move to my questions, that what happens concerning the Staff Regulations in the Commission has a fundamental role on our responsibility also as employers of staff because, of course, the European Parliament staff operate under the same conditions.	1.4344686351453422
That will form part of the work that we will have to do and I sure that all of you today will want to engage in that process.	1.321566533379783
Now there were two points I wanted to pick up with Mr Kinnock, if I may.	1.1696320419044532
The first one concerns the timescale of these important reforms.	0.8647358127809404
Mr Prodi said in his very important opening statement that he had identified severe problems in the Commission about low morale and low motivation, and clearly that is a major concern.	1.4856996595432694
Big expectations are built up for these reforms both within the Commission and outside.	1.2441532165737692
And if we are to move forward, I suggest to you that the reforms on the personnel side, early evidence of change of culture, empowerment and motivation of staff have to happen sooner rather than later.	1.2156928932588709
And if we look at the original proposals - and I suspect that we will see the same in the new ones - it was not until 2002 that we were going to complete overall reform of the Staff Regulations.	1.4650727585868661
Indeed, it was not until 2001 that some of the key elements of appraisal were going to be introduced.	1.341605691059508
I suggest that is too long, and we really must move forward much more quickly than that.	1.3964783321799523
The second point that I want to make concerns information technology.	1.2636845986986174
Have you really taken into account the changes in staff structure that new information technology will bring about, because those will be fundamental in the new direction of these reforms.	1.3130662033021194
On the second part of Mr Harbour' s question, he will see in the course of this year how with greater precision we will be showing how the application more extensively of information technology will facilitate change, not only in terms of the working practices and conditions of the staff but in the operation of the Commission, as the President briefly outlined in his statement.	1.4030959387678406
Could I thank Mr Harbour for the energetic commitment that he has shown to the issue on which he is rapporteur and respond to him by saying that we firmly believe that the morale, the motivation and the professional commitment of Commission officials, which is already very strong, will be enhanced by the introduction of comprehensive training, the allocation of responsibility, the upgrading of management and a number of other changes which we will be introducing.	1.366579071635188
Cultures are products of structures and systems, and the structures and systems have become old.	1.171195598131927
By renovating those structures and systems, in some cases very radically, we will assist the people of the Commission who are strongly committed to the European ideal and have high quality of capability to release talents and manifest themselves as never before.	1.3845099287538563
I would like to make one last point in answer to Mr Harbour.	1.1765599931096598
I share his impatience to secure the full implementation of the mechanisms of reform and change practices.	1.0617863403743946
I wish I could honestly say to him that we will be compiling and providing in the form of proposals communications before 2001 and certainly be putting them into effect before 2002, but he will be aware there are legally required consultation procedures and periods which we must respect.	1.2502728392970008
I do not use those as an excuse.	1.281083925485963
We indeed take huge encouragement from the very positive and constructive response offered in the consultation over the last month and I believe therefore that although there may be a slight delay in the compilation and application of reforms, these reforms will nevertheless be strengthened by the extent of understanding and commitment that will be produced by the consultation which we will undertake assiduously.	1.250802682384578
I would like everything to happen much more quickly.	1.3490686413517072
It is better to do it absolutely properly.	1.0800523399593698
Madam President, we admire Mr Kinnock' s vision and sense of realism. For he is holding up visions of a well-oiled and effective administration and is, at the same time, drawing our attention to the difficulties which will arise and which can already be anticipated.	1.13666778123784
Mr Prodi has pointed out that he would like to give up a few of his responsibilities.	1.6271670885971214
We will therefore need to focus on policy priorities first.	1.0968776562292086
I think it is more important to bring into focus what we want to achieve before we give up responsibilities, because I can imagine we could meet with a great deal of protest otherwise.	1.347858944706449
Enlargement - that is enlargement of the Union - is one of the key challenges in this context.	1.4868202545367135
I would also like to point out that when it comes to keeping the peace, it will require a much greater effort to get a great many more people on board.	1.3615668406431083
We must resolutely switch from our present, rather bureaucratic approach which we are all familiar with - it pervades our development cooperation for example - to a cooperation for peace.	1.3823603992624918
Could Mr Kinnock say what timeframe he is expecting the Council and Parliament to come up with for these priorities?	1.1293425769630692
I am grateful to Mrs Maes for not only the comments that she has made now but the sustained commitment that she has shown to change ever since she came into this House.	1.183200992761372
Can I assure her that our attitude is not guided by any motivation to farm out.	0.8764987963999126
We are concentrating on core tasks and we are concentrating on priorities, not in order to evade any obligations but to absolutely guarantee that we can totally fulfil the central obligations that we have.	1.1884733023743401
One of those obligations very clearly - and I am at one with Mrs Maes in this - is in the preparation for effective, smooth, calm enlargement that will work to the mutual benefit both of the people of the incoming countries and of the citizens of the current Union.	1.4546422299508284
One of the reasons for having to ensure that we focus very strongly and sharply on our priorities is to be able to guarantee that we can fulfil that absolutely critical role of being the agents of enlargement to maximum effect.	1.2529222365696273
Can I say to her that the mechanisms that we are going to introduce of strategic planning and programming facilitated by activity-based management may sound to be immensely dry and completely bereft of any idealism.	1.085606435873081
Since I was brought up to believe that the victory of ideals needs to be organised, I may be able to make an appeal to her to understand and support our mechanistic view of this because it is for the great and central purposes of the Union and its enlargement.	1.477731118863733
I hope that, in terms of the degree of cooperation and partnership that we can enjoy in all aspects of this policy with the Council and with Parliament, not only will we get rapid implementation of policy development in the most effective way, but that we will be able to do it by coordination at the right time which will produce the maximum benefit for the Union.	1.4886762464277006
I do believe that reform with all it implies, including the new mechanisms, will very strongly facilitate changes of that kind.	1.2640387812364604
I would like to take the opportunity firstly to congratulate the Commission on unanimously bringing forward this timely and substantial White Paper with the accompanying action plan and I think when the President of the Commission described his Vice-President as acting with intelligence, enthusiasm and energy that indeed that is a fair and valid description with regard to this procedure.	1.3613762867734869
Two questions if I may.	0.5820944958601671
We anticipate, if I understand correctly, a report in September on core activities.	1.426216084680126
Will that already begin to impact possibly in some form of amendment to the budget exercise which the Parliament will have to close in the last quarter of this year in respect of the budget for 2001 and can you already say whether the Commission anticipates such a procedure?	1.2712505004844639
Secondly, on the question of ex ante and ex post auditing and procedures, do I understand correctly - and I have not had the opportunity to wade into the detail of the paper - that the unanimous decision of the Commission is indeed to empower the Directorates-General to liberate them from the ex ante visae system but to put in their place a strong ex post and independent and centralised audit system?	1.3718191187077085
If that is the case I can say at least that after prolonged and at times engaging discussion each way in my own Group, I believe that if we have demanded in this House as we have done that we have responsibility at each level in the Commission, its necessary counterpart is that we free people up to be managers.	1.5073579662852161
Let the managers manage.	0.44184164245424873
I want to thank Mr Cox and indeed his group for the way in which several Members have strongly engaged themselves and interested themselves in the detail of reform which can sometimes be rather trying but is always, as he indicated, worthwhile.	1.249754936265465
So far as the September communication is concerned, it is unprecedented.	1.5654703454751326
It will not be just one of the screenings that the Commission has periodically undertaken but a very thorough and sharp review within Directorates-General and across the Commission for which we have established a mechanism for reviewing the demands on us and the means that we have to meet those demands.	1.3695574592650546
It is conceivable therefore - I cannot say with absolute certainty at this stage - that at that stage in the budgetary procedure and in the cycle in which Parliament is engaged we may have to - I emphasise very strongly the conditional - we may have to come to Parliament with some conclusions and discuss the possibility of revision.	1.4437588906413121
That is a sensible forecast to make, it is not an ambition that we have but it is a possibility that we may have to entertain.	1.542399639661568
Can I thank Mr Cox for underlining the virtue of following absolutely the recommendation of the Committee of Independent Experts and introducing a system which will end definitely with the revision of the financial regulation and the end of centralised ex ante control.	1.225575165723023
I would emphasise, too, that the intention is not only to liberate the personnel of the Commission - that is certainly an objective - but it is simultaneously to "responsibilise" - it is an appalling word but we all know what it means.	1.5735662140666948
In undertaking such a development in our organisation I am certain that we can match or even advance upon the success and increase in job motivation which has come as a consequence of similar developments in several administrations, both in the public sector and in the private sector, in the last decade or so.	1.255403169177642
I think that the end of the centralised system will certainly not result in any relaxation of effective financial control but will increase its effectiveness and its relationship to operational tasks.	1.20481248377757
Financial control will be absolutely secured, both because of the way in which we will introduce the changes, and because we will introduce a completely professional, independent internal audit service.	1.3861756599267294
As I said earlier, our ambition is total security for money and value for money.	0.9726644746718635
We are also interested in value for the people who work for us.	1.233371430655941
The changes in financial management and control will greatly enhance the possibility of doing all of that.	0.9917882153195756
I am also grateful, at the risk of being repetitive, to Mrs Theato for the consistent attention that she has given to these matters and indeed the way in which, if she will allow me to say so, she played midwife to many of the changes which we are now contemplating.	1.52143808013236
I hope that she will come to take pride in the child for which she has at least part parentage.	1.1844897959121425
First of all, I am not sure if I got the interpretation properly, but I do not think it would be possible for someone as expert as Mrs Theato to talk about the abolition of independent financial control.	1.3377166213225151
There is a degree of independence obviously allocated to the current Financial Controller by the financial regulation.	1.1730872716643197
However, because of the mixture of roles of both financial management and control, and audit under the present terms, it is very difficult to think of this as an uncompromised role, no matter how great the integrity of the person actually holding it.	1.3040327167374561
So, the changes that we seek to make - as I say consistent with the very strong and clear recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts - are not negative in any way at all.	1.4580445846206924
Coherence, consistency and universally good standards in a decentralised system of financial control are guaranteed by a series of measures.	1.0174692917849841
One is to ensure high quality training, another is to ensure that no Directorate-General can take over financial control responsibilities unless and until the auditor service is absolutely certain of the robustness of the system, another is the establishment of a central financial service, as honourable Members will see from the White Paper, to ensure that those standards are set and supervised, and there is also the additional belt and braces and boilersuit approach of having an effective and independent internal audit service.	1.2262748781858948
	-0.0
I will not go into all the details in the course of a parliamentary answer of this kind but I am certain that on examination Mrs Theato will be able to see that in the details of the White Paper, there are very strong assurances.	1.3571257262276593
There will also be evidence of the fact that we have taken heed of the representations made in this House particularly in the Committee on Budgetary Control, and that is significant in respect of the use of ex ante visas in Directorates-General.	1.2441225649765928
If that is felt in a Directorate-General to be a relevant and effective way of enhancing financial control, the ex ante system can be used.	1.2439670588437173
Naturally, there are diverse requirements across the Commission depending on the number and nature of the financial transactions in which particular Directorates-General have to engage.	1.3219695103157854
Account is taken of that too in the White Paper but where there is a desire and a demonstrated need for the use of such a system, it most certainly can be used.	1.2672218115963345
Lastly on transition, I share the reservations of Mrs Theato over so-called "soft law" .	1.0176298786337508
We have had this discussion before and she knows I make a distinction between various forms of codes which can have a very positive effect and eventually be turned into what I suppose we could call "hard law" .	1.078165367608121
But, on this issue, I do not see any room for soft law which is why in the transition period there will be total adherence to the current financial regulation until that law is changed by due democratic process in this House and in the Council.	1.412999001289213
There are absolute assurances of that and provisions made for it in the White Paper.	0.9144500004804698
In addition, however, and very importantly, because it is a transition period, there will be training, there will be advice, there will be support, there will be assurances.	1.5109002964228708
The new head of the audit unit will be in place by 1 May and with that and an accumulation of other assurances I think that we can be as certain as human beings can be that there will be a totally secure system even during the period of transition.	1.2843858969917268
Two other points I must make, because this is an essential question central to reform.	1.5490756914649724
The first one is that people feel - for reasons I well understand - that in that transition there is a danger either of irresponsibility or of inertia.	1.5548518717474318
Irresponsibility because the feeling exists in some quarters that there will not be sufficient control and discipline.	1.055304250289951
I completely reject that simply because of the standards of Commission officials, the responsibility of directors-general and the assurances that we have built into the system.	1.2081279017567301
Inertia would only be born of anxiety and we are doing everything we can in terms of support and training to diminish the possibility of that occurring.	1.2070787614297303
Lastly, the system we currently have - as the Committee of Independent Experts asserted very strongly - is now unsustainable.	1.6400795079544153
Indeed the Court of Auditors has called it fiction.	1.0111622523275512
Change will have to come in any case, change would imply a transition period because there is no possibility of any system being invented that could enable us to move from one Friday to the next Monday from one system to another.	1.1955407272369283
In so far as it is at all possible with all of the advice at our disposal and all of the design capability that we have, I am certain that we have installed, or that we will install on the basis of our proposals, a system that will provide the Union, its taxpayers and this House with complete security.	1.6489456785542862
Madam President, great importance has been attached to the reform process, which deserves to be acknowledged, although this may be somewhat premature.	1.4493641400900723
My question is this: there is a need for reform, due not least to the accession of new countries, and thus to the enlargement of the Union.	1.3615039287398434
How can we - the Commission, Parliament and also the national parliaments of the applicant countries - meet this challenge more effectively, taking into account the ideas and considerations of the applicant countries?	1.2985189348596669
The delegations are actively engaged - as am I in my delegation for relations with the Czech Republic - but it is clear that there is often a pronounced schoolmasterish tone to our dealings with one another.	1.2495530161521005
How can the reform process help make the relationship and cooperation between the European Parliament, the national parliaments and also the Commission, and the work they perform together, more effective?	1.6814042814980488
I am grateful to the honourable Member for underlining the fact that, apart from its own inherent merits, reform will be made necessary by accession, the enlargements, and particularly the kind of enlargements that our Union will shortly be engaging in.	1.198213084086784
It is essential that we have that reform, both for the sake of the current Union, and certainly to facilitate accessions.	1.5474978911095223
In the course of the coming years I will be continuing the practice I have already started, together with several of my Commission colleagues obviously, of very profound discussions with the administrations of the incoming new Member States.	1.3187419730328405
We are doing it in order to try to explain in the fullest terms the system into which they will be entering.	1.2626068317327381
I would also like to see the enrichment of the training effort undertaken both by current Member States and by the Union generally to ensure that as new officials come in to the Commission and officials and administrators in the Member States have to deal with the realities, the complex realities of membership of the Union and the single market, it will be difficult to see the joins.	1.469854189633301
That is the level of sophistication and provision I would like to see.	1.1401167802503778
All I can do now is to promise to strive for it.	0.9299638374086128
Can I start by wishing the Commissioner a very happy St David' s Day.	0.9405200012227785
Thank you for the presentation.	1.049935623142678
It is important that the Commission never loses sight of the fact that the reform process will be a complete waste of time unless it reconnects with the European public.	1.3525728328489734
That really has to be the sharp focus the whole time.	1.1588643327837211
It has to give a service to them and certainly the recommendations on cutting down on payment delays I am sure will be very welcome, but the other major complaint we get from the people we represent is paperwork. Excessive paperwork.	1.4014855703951714
Is there a reference to cutting down paperwork and bureaucracy for applicants to European funding whilst ensuring financial control?	0.9080351833082714
That is a clear complaint that we get.	1.380325394111493
That needs to be addressed.	0.3945565148784815
The other question I would like to ask is on the audit progress committee.	1.2554999117927295
This, of course, is welcome, but it is essential it include a reference to the monitoring of recommendations that come from the European Parliament within our discharge procedure.	1.457423057885163
Will you be adding that into your audit progress committee' s work?	0.9724731314943116
Finally, the Socialist Group agrees with activity-based budgeting and with responsibilisation and you will be judged, as Mr Prodi says, by your actions, not your words.	1.5704514550217188
The mission of reconnecting with the European public is critical as Mrs Morgan says and that can only be done on the basis of action not words.	1.3324212373277573
I say that with some deference in the European Parliament where there are so many experts in words, but we will try to lead by example.	1.4054811617974916
As far as excessive paper is concerned, the dilemma is spelt out by Mrs Morgan.	1.1612098675462912
We detest the excess of paper, but given the requirements that we have to check and re-check and double check in order to guarantee effective financial control, sometimes the requirements of administration, which some call bureaucracy, are unavoidable.	1.344611844737305
In order however to strip back those obligations to their minimum, we are not just talking about it; we will be appointing in the very near future a deputy secretary-general, an additional deputy secretary-general with the specific mandate and mission of identifying best practices and spreading them throughout the Commission and of ensuring a radical reduction in the procedures which generate so much paper, so much bureaucracy and I must say so much frustration, not only for the citizens and businesses of the Union but for the people who work for the Commission too.	1.3909261693299833
We shall certainly strive in order to do that and I think that the effect over the next few years will start to become apparent.	1.3389233815542771
One of our difficulties is always going to be of course that the better we are at reform, the less anybody is going to know about it so we will be relying on our friends and partners in the European Parliament to explain with their customary generosity the full efforts being made by the Commission to properly serve the people of Europe.	1.429539216912972
I know I can rely on everyone here.	0.6486175375635245
That concludes Question Time.	0.17283601513432983
I should like to thank President Prodi and Commissioner Kinnock.	1.316779297734987
Statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy	0.3949262442784289
The next item is the statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy.	0.5821450820660803
Please give a very warm welcome to Mr Javier Solana to whom I shall hand over without further delay.	0.9337426751498039
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure for me to appear before you again, here in the European Parliament.	1.14218364131751
Much has happened since the last time I was here to talk about foreign and security policy issues in our continent.	1.1324124934039916
Sometimes we may feel that too much has happened.	0.9081018140634548
This afternoon I should like to share with you some ideas, particularly on the Common Foreign and Security Policy.	1.0927086114453992
The world has certainly moved on significantly in recent months and many events have occurred. However, I will wait for question time to give specific answers to any questions you may have for me.	1.210239946049937
In recent months, since the last time I appeared before you, important events have occurred in this House and also in the European Union. I would remind you of two of these events, one of which is very dear to you all as members of this Parliament, and particularly to the President.	1.5653208374686631
These are the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference and the starting of negotiations with the future members of the European Union.	1.0279171154486788
The events in Kosovo and the Balkans in general have certainly stirred our hearts and minds. There are also important issues at stake in the Middle East in which the President of this House played a major role on her recent trip.	1.360105749126266
Certain important steps have been taken to secure progress in the summit between Europe and Africa in which I was pleased to participate in cooperation with the Portuguese presidency. A vital meeting has also taken place in Portugal, in Vilamoura, with the eighteen countries of Latin America to try and develop a deeper relationship between the European Union and Latin America.	1.3439316677512734
Chechnya has also been one of our main concerns and I will speak briefly on this at the end, in the light of an important conversation which I had this morning with the Council of Europe representative, Mr Álvaro Gil-Robles, on his recent visit to the region.	1.545445761880142
However, I realise that you asked me here to talk to you more specifically about foreign policy and particularly security policy in Europe since Helsinki.	1.2693294394801342
I will speak of this briefly. If you wish to ask questions at the appropriate time, I will be pleased to answer them.	1.343199809955418
The Helsinki Summit under the Finnish presidency took place a little over two months ago.	0.9943108588712823
Decisions were taken at this summit which are fundamental for foreign and security policy in our continent.	1.1535316287311361
These were essentially of three types which I will describe.	0.9663967590910034
The first was the decision to establish within the European Union three committees for decision making relating to crisis management.	1.1398901513668942
The first is a political and security committee, the second is a military committee representing the Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen Member States and the third committee is to make decisions on the European Union' s relations with third countries and other organisations.	1.4144950536099634
This basically involves relations between the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance and relations between the European Union and those countries which, although geographically in Europe, are not part of the European Union, or at least not at the moment.	1.4005888049159976
I will restrict myself to these three points in order to bring you up to date with events.	1.1045856700853938
Firstly, with regard to the decision-making bodies, the Political and Security Committee met for the first time this morning, 1 March 2000. This committee was established by the last General Affairs Council.	1.4244018836319186
Therefore, two months after the Helsinki declaration and decision, a Political and Security Committee meeting has taken place for the first time within the European Union.	1.3999457131189714
I was able to attend this meeting this morning and met with the representatives at lunch.	1.0250104327595384
You can be satisfied with the progress made.	0.8743002203795622
The fifteen countries have appointed diplomatic experts at ambassador level in order to tackle one of the most important issues which we will face in the coming months.	1.180870169104187
Secondly, the Military Committee, which represents the various Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen countries, will hold its first meeting on 7 March which will be just over two months after the Helsinki declaration.	1.3340538547337069
This Military Committee, as you can imagine, will have various duties.	1.4077953377944132
In the interim stage, its basic duty will be to advise the Council and myself and to take initial decisions on how to set up the final bodies which we will, of course, try to have in place by the end of this year or the beginning of next.	1.4232793694504642
Thirdly, the Military Staff will represent senior military personnel from the fifteen countries. Together with myself, this staff will form the civil and military secretariat whose task will be to prepare, with the assistance of the Military Committee, any operation needing to be organised in due course in the context of crisis management within the European Union.	1.3792413962880241
This crisis management will not be a strictly military affair but the military representatives and the Military Committee will be responsible for advising on the logistics of any humanitarian operations which may require the involvement of military forces.	1.0655769326580666
Mozambique is surely an excellent current example of how intervention may be required in terms of military logistics, not for military purposes, but with strictly humanitarian ends.	1.318614222333901
We are therefore working diligently in this respect. Madam President, if, a few months ago when I had the pleasure of appearing before you for the first time, I had told you that I would be able to announce on 1 March 2000 that the first meeting of the Political Committee had been held today, that the Military Committee would be up and running within a week after that and that tomorrow the first members of the Military Staff would start to arrive at the building which we are to use, many of you would surely have thought that the High Representative was going mad.	1.5510941805211444
We are not mad. What we have done is to work long and hard, with determination and, without a shadow of a doubt, with the support not only of yourselves but also of the Heads of State and Government of the countries which you represent.	1.4896239612278763
Few initiatives within the European Union can have been progressed with such determination, drive and commitment as has been achieved in crisis management since Helsinki.	1.2487545308919399
In less than two months we have established the mechanics for cooperation with the Commission.	1.0204044953888602
I must thank Commissioner Patten who is here today for his support and the tremendous energy that he has also invested in trying to ensure that all these issues could be settled in such a short time.	1.1639978995247275
I will now move on to the second issue which I should like to discuss with you. We have already looked at the bodies which we have set up but we also have a fundamental obligation in terms of our credibility.	1.5467240513775309
Europe must be able to provide the military capacity to act in times of crisis. I must repeat that the European Union will not be using this military capacity to make war but to bring peace.	1.4956265945597318
It will participate in crisis management in order to help where there is war or situations of conflict, to re-establish calm and to take the heat out of these situations and also to avoid them. As you may recall, it was in this respect that the Helsinki Summit intelligently agreed to form a force of 60 000 soldiers from all the Member States.	1.38759161805556
It will be possible for this force to be deployed at any given moment within 60 days, or two months, to prevent a crisis and for it to remain in action to prevent conflict for a period of one year. This is a major operation and an important objective but I can say that we are in a position to meet this challenge which the Heads of State and Government posed in Helsinki.	1.4044586272289845
On Monday, just two days ago, in Sintra, a beautiful city very close to Lisbon, the Defence Ministers of the fifteen Member States met and took some important decisions towards implementing this Headline Goal defined in Helsinki.	1.2594572254734882
The proposed timetable is tight but essential and will require great determination from all of us, including this House.	1.1013018767265157
I will set this out in five points.	0.8525194652958952
Firstly, before the next General Affairs Council which will take place this month, we shall be able to define precisely the detailed and specific meaning of the Headline Goal, bearing in mind the views that the military planners may consider appropriate.	1.3836291839406092
To say that we will deploy 60 000 soldiers in a peacekeeping operation is not the same thing as organising an operation to achieve peace.	1.3881582049988228
We must therefore have considered all possible scenarios so that we can do this job and do it well.	1.0908624682748738
Before 24 March we will therefore have established this timetable so that the General Affairs Council can, on this date, do its job and do it well.	1.285195026769565
Secondly, we must look at the capacity which each country has so that this total force of 60 000 soldiers is distributed in an orderly and efficient manner between the fifteen countries.	1.1917539092935048
Thirdly, we must look at the differences between the Headline Goal and what each country can provide.	1.164930014657282
We may not have enough between the fifteen countries which will have to make an additional effort to meet the proposed needs.	1.341045124326646
How can we do this?	1.0898032591565414
This should be decided by a Conference of the fifteen countries to look at the gap between what we want and what we have and to see how to distribute what we need among the fifteen Member States.	1.358596948659536
Madam President, the timetable must ensure that, by December of this year during the French presidency, the process can be completed with a major conference of forces from all the countries to ensure that the needs and capacities match. We will then be able to say truthfully that we have a plan of what we must do between the end of the year 2000 and the year 2003 which is the date we have set for having this capacity available.	1.6038077180066208
This is what we are doing and we are committed to this.	1.2079234088162154
We have worked hard in recent months and weeks and will continue to do so for the rest of this year during the Portuguese presidency, which is clearly carrying out excellent work, and during the French presidency which will undoubtedly continue working with the same speed and skill as it has demonstrated on other occasions.	1.3104083140008553
I would like to say that in the meantime there will be at least four European Councils, those in Lisbon and Feira and two during the French presidency.	1.4032932601361454
On these four occasions, the Heads of Government will also be ready to continue examining these issues so that we do not lose the momentum and so that, by the year 2003, we are able to deploy what we have agreed, if necessary.	1.5419987202743857
Madam President, we are therefore working on this issue with determination, energy and the full support of all the governments and all the Heads of Government.	1.450424461560898
I have two further points to make on this process.	1.108166969052531
The European Union must carry out this whole operation in collaboration with the third countries to which I have referred which, although geographically in Europe, are not members of the European Union.	1.407593921936412
We have to work with these countries and involve them so that if such a crisis arises, which I hope will not be the case, all forces and all countries will be more than welcome.	1.5204917687629496
Secondly, we have to be able to establish a smooth and transparent relationship with NATO. The operations to be carried out in the future will be of three types.	1.4449095033874868
The first type will be operations in which European forces are involved within the framework of NATO. The second will be operations involving European forces and directed by them, but using the means and infrastructure of NATO.	1.3124880399805114
The third will be operations in which the European forces act alone. In the first and second types we will need to cooperate with NATO and must therefore establish a transparent, positive and confident relationship between ourselves and NATO, as appropriate, which will be good for both the Alliance and ourselves.	1.4065605111116006
Madam President, I have talked about the military capacity which we are ready to provide, the timetable which we want to apply and what has been achieved in recent months.	1.5735788576505614
However, we must not forget that these crisis operations must be tackled from a civilian front as well.	1.1851621130877201
As far as possible, we are also providing or trying to provide solutions to any humanitarian crises and public order crises such as those which are currently unfortunately occurring in Kosovo and the Balkans.	1.220719112553184
We are working in this direction with the Commission and Commissioner Patten.	1.634942393767556
On Saturday morning I will meet with all the Ministers for Home Affairs of the fifteen Member States to try and make them see the need to mobilise a police force as well.	1.122747709724579
There are times when a crisis which started out with a military need develops so that, after a few months, a police force is needed rather than a military force. Then, in the final moments of the crisis, it is perhaps courts or bodies to create democratic institutions which a country may need more than police.	1.3592352067543843
In this respect we are also working closely and positively with the Commission.	1.3471779243927613
I am not going to say much more on these issues.	1.032194960040988
Many other events have taken place in recent weeks which I should like to mention, such as in Kosovo, the Middle East and Chechnya. There are also many other issues which I should like to discuss with you.	1.4055172957509074
However, I would prefer, Madam President, to stop at this point and allow questions to be asked so that I have time to answer them.	1.5538232989499208
However, before this happens, I must tell you about a telephone conversation which I had a few hours ago with the Council of Europe representative on the subject of Chechnya.	1.5005298941136134
Mr Gil-Robles returned this morning from Chechnya where he visited Grozny. When we spoke he gave me his initial impressions which are not good, as you can imagine.	1.2375733303373995
The situation in the refugee camps in Ingushetia is poor and deteriorating.	0.8618261541588741
In most cases there is no hot food during the day as the Russian authorities are failing to provide this and are leaving this work to the non-governmental organisations.	1.1416736050427851
In Grozny, there are now approximately 20 000 people in a desperate situation who have to walk miles and miles to get something to eat.	1.149698699684738
Yet there is one positive point which I must share with you.	1.1440928654933098
Mr Gil-Robles told me that, when talking with the Acting President and the Foreign Affairs Minister last night, the Russian authorities had agreed to allow Council of Europe representatives to be involved in the humanitarian mission which is in Grozny at the moment and which is being directed by the Russian authorities. The latter were also in negotiation with the Chairman-in-Office of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe to allow OSCE representatives to be involved as well, if feasible.	1.3840198589067338
These are the only positive aspects which I can tell you about at the moment.	1.3369385326962866
I hope that in the next few hours we will have more information from Commissioner Gil-Robles and, in particular, better news from the Russian authorities.	1.4497798476119743
Madam President, this brings me to the end of my speech.	1.4565841050161532
I would just like to repeat what I said at the beginning.	0.97205536440584
I am delighted to be participating in the work of this House and to be informing you about the work which is being carried out collectively by all the countries and with the Commission. This work has one clear objective of allowing our European Union to participate as effectively as possible in the international sphere in peacekeeping operations.	1.457139304890166
Europe does not want to make war anywhere but rather to cooperate so that peace and stability can be achieved throughout the world.	1.26683522395739
Thank you very much indeed, Mr Solana. I shall now give the floor to Mr Poettering, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.	1.207543738118112
Thank you, Mr Poettering.	0.9021209512086343
Mr Poettering, it goes without saying that Commissioner Patten' s participation in this debate is most opportune, and we have agreed that I will allow him to speak when he so wishes.	1.394394406860655
Commissioner, would you like to speak now or a little later?	1.4407462541916232
(The Commissioner indicated that he would speak later) Very well, thank you.	0.9817196837811544
Madam President, Commissioner Patten, Mr Javier Solana, usted no es una persona loca, todo lo contrario (you are not mad, quite the opposite).	1.1856187792102657
We are delighted about the rapid progress which has been made following the Helsinki Summit.	1.1272395599294693
We know that you have an important role in this.	1.209768274105237
I am also very pleased that you have mentioned Mozambique today, and in this context, and that a major humanitarian effort can be made using the resources in question.	1.6285368495788857
We cannot, of course, talk about foreign policy without mentioning Chechnya.	1.0053834920984606
My friend Jacques Poos will be talking about this on behalf of my Group.	0.929818519827195
I want to concentrate on Kosovo.	0.8521212936652692
It is now quite clear that the situation in Kosovo shows that a lasting solution to the crisis there cannot be provided by military means.	1.253395447041784
The KFOR forces have made, and are making, an invaluable contribution, but tanks and fire trenches cannot deal with political problems and ethnic conflicts in the longer term.	1.302335966300331
It has now reached the point where the Pentagon has prohibited American forces from returning to northern Mitrovica.	0.8948621994008059
They have now been replaced by robust Danish, Finnish and Swedish troops.	0.8215766025889828
It is easy to despair in the face of the violence and the hatred, but it is important for the sake of Kosovo, the Balkans and Europe that we do not fail.	1.3893874642105692
Through the Stability Pact, we have taken major steps which place us under an obligation.	1.2194218083040493
This is therefore a test of credibility for the Union' s common foreign and security policy.	1.0466804363676088
At the moment, there is a huge shortage of suitable personnel in Kosovo.	1.0762612731989074
Last autumn, we already heard Mr Bernard Kouchner call for a civilian police force.	1.20556888805061
I am now delighted to hear that, this weekend, Mr Javier Solana is to call the interior ministers together to discuss the question of policing.	1.3286122937875853
I hope that this discussion will, in the first place, concentrate upon Kosovo so that the desperate situation there might be remedied.	1.2408982313196228
When it comes to the Balkans and Kosovo, I also hope that the Council will comply with Parliament' s and, as I understand it, also the Commission' s demands for a multiannual budget for operations in Kosovo.	1.5263854987309884
The situation in Kosovo has taught us a lot, for example that we should provide ourselves with a military capacity for crisis management, an idea which has already been translated into practical action.	1.444798533979541
Another, at least as important, lesson of our experience, however, is that it is better to prevent a crisis than to have to take emergency action subsequently.	1.3442919550013364
Therefore, the EU must also have an independent, credible conflict-prevention capacity.	1.3572816610279148
On behalf of the Commission, Commissioner Patten has taken a number of praiseworthy initiatives in this direction.	1.3183320524152962
I am thinking of the proposal to set up a rapid reaction facility and a rapid reaction force for non-military operations and to introduce headline goals for non-military operations, together with a Commission Crisis Centre.	1.2040465215457266
My last question to Mr Solana is this: what concrete preparations are being made for conflict prevention of this kind?	1.3262331620463956
How have these been organised by Mr Solana' s office and how has the initiative been coordinated with the Commission?	1.1523504708361296
Mr President, Mr Solana, you have the full support and confidence of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, but we would remind you of the huge responsibility which now rests upon your shoulders.	1.1693643073587907
I am thinking partly of the forthcoming and important humanitarian, peace-keeping and peace-making tasks.	1.2053120070152155
But I am also thinking of the responsibility you now have for ensuring that the new European cooperation on defence does not give rise to any kind of split between NATO and the EU or between the United States and Europe.	1.3053836043962486
Such a split would only delight the despots and rogue States which threaten freedom and human rights.	0.7358818247584957
I believe you heard the concerns which some members of the American Congress expressed last week here in Parliament.	1.1031642347588
You must lay these concerns to rest for, as you yourself have said, when we are able to present a united transatlantic front, we are in a position to do something.	1.4575960265061936
When we are divided, we are weakened, and the suffering of the oppressed is prolonged.	1.5134025646139702
So, maintain as close contact as possible with our American allies and do not forget Norway, Turkey and Canada, either.	1.200624030687518
You also share a heavy degree of responsibility for ensuring that we do not end up as paper tigers.	1.022754109537442
As George Robertson has said so often, we have two million soldiers but could not even put 40 000 soldiers into Kosovo.	1.1703282613047723
It may have been our weakness and lack of credibility which led to the war.	0.9502230260854463
Diplomatic pressure is only successful when it is backed up by credible economic and military threats.	0.9669160429307678
Everything else is wishful thinking.	0.5053846526137632
That is why the Member States must either authorise more expenditure or rearrange their priorities in favour of modern mobile units so that our soldiers are protected by the best equipment. We are therefore delighted about the decisions which were taken last Monday in Sintra.	1.3271694446500009
The third heavy burden on your shoulders is the responsibility for ensuring parliamentary scrutiny.	1.078493056161894
This should be exercised first and foremost in the Member States.	0.9805759691887822
No soldier can, of course, be despatched without the approval of the relevant national parliament.	1.1819304673226478
It is therefore wrong for people to talk about a European army.	1.3277435882985524
It will be a force comprised of various national units.	1.1202137702150983
What is new is that it will be well prepared and able to act quickly under effective common leadership and using modern equipment.	1.1342053863918649
However, there is, of course, also room for a certain amount of parliamentary scrutiny and control by the European Parliament.	1.417793304366746
As someone who both speaks and listens, we are glad to see you as a frequent guest both here in plenary and in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.	0.9905970700492158
Finally, I should like to join you in expressing my pleasure at the incredible unity and speed with which this new form of cooperation is being set in motion.	1.1217831070799822
Yesterday, a few of us met the Portuguese Defence Minister.	1.314642785846354
He was just as pleased and pleasantly surprised as yourself at the fact that it had been possible to agree about so much.	1.1605979832356832
Bear in mind that there are also non-aligned countries at the negotiating table.	1.0733403001530173
We share your delight, as long as we do not race ahead so quickly that transatlantic cooperation is impaired.	1.046177405780127
There is one thing I shall again finally emphasise: that the purpose of all this is, of course, that we should acquire such credibility when we exercise economic and military pressure that military force is not used at all.	1.2304017316159972
That is the purpose of all this, and it is therefore also important that you should cooperate with Mr Patten, for it is military, economic and diplomatic pressure which together will put a stop to atrocities in neighbouring countries.	1.3044828182730601
Mr President, Mr Solana, we are all behaving like children.	1.351599033692605
You are building castles in the air and your route map up to the year 2003 calls for 60 000 soldiers.	1.037642875981632
It is extraordinary what decisions we took in Sintra concerning 2004, 2005, 2006.	0.8559192037215474
But what about Kosovo in the year 2000?	0.8983231870595456
You have spoken to Mr Gil-Robles. I have received an e-mail from a former colleague, Pierre Pradier, who is in Pristina at the moment.	1.3266822134210423
He tells the story of a Serbian doctor who has just been murdered in Pristina.	0.8664333530506225
He treated Roma, Albanians and Serbs and that is something unforgivable in Kosovo.	1.0704736209514178
A man with three children and he was murdered.	0.7492379993358029
We need policemen in Kosovo right now!	0.6446944173159741
We need soldiers who do not have a doctrine to put into practice.	0.9248954148213303
I am not a warmonger, but if we do not have soldiers to stop the criminals in Kosovo, then what is the point in having soldiers at all?	1.51718141823456
People may have to risk their lives in Kosovo, but that is the price of freedom at the moment.	1.403799046715631
If we allow what is happening today in Kosovo to continue - border provocation, Serbian provocation, Albanian provocation, etc. we are heading for war.	1.2695685198922244
Tell me, what civilian forces are being mobilised, Mr Patten?	1.4345704035567137
We need a civilian task force in Kosovo now to monitor what is happening, and to tell the military and the police what they must do, otherwise everything we did in Bosnia and everything we did in Kosovo will be negated by the reality of a country that is sinking deeper and deeper into violence.	1.3500511586701787
(Interruption from the extreme right by Mr Martinez) We have a major problem, because we are providing travel warrants for the people, but we are incapable of acting when there is an enormous humanitarian crisis, as in Chechnya.	1.5508884496448643
Mr Poettering is right - when he is right you have to tell him so.	1.33606064615624
He is not always right, but in this case he is.	1.7564183274660918
I am in favour of a hardline policy against Austria, but we shall then have a responsibility towards Russia.	1.3430749007721585
I do not like foreign ministers who say nothing - whether they are German and from my party, whether they are French from the broad left or whether they are Italians from any party!	1.1664491710996763
In the current situation, we should say to the Russians "If you want money, if you want us to reduce your debts, you must allow a civilian peacekeeping force into Russia" .	1.4577565081263584
If not, we are not prepared to pay for their war, since, by reducing the debt, by giving them money, we are paying their soldiers to carry out the massacres.	1.4469239531094804
We are accomplices in the massacres in Chechnya if we continue to give money to the butchers.	0.9877019649627586
It is not enough just to say, "You, the murderers, please stop the slaughter!"	1.400044367945791
They know full well that they should not commit these acts.	1.016832666935744
Do you think that Mr Putin does not know that what he is doing in Chechnya is not good?	1.2881824393482506
But that is his strategy, he instigated this war.	1.1718195615128855
From the beginning, he wanted this war in order to become president.	1.2563095286822161
So that is the world as it is today.	1.2806512338079314
For that reason I say to you: my Group is not entirely in agreement, but I am in favour of European defence.	1.4527222463127396
I believe that European defence should be scrutinised by the European Parliament and by the national parliaments.	1.37162671708011
First of all, the European Parliament must give the green light to something and then the national parliaments will decide whether or not to send their soldiers.	1.268434385882208
If a civilian task force can, at the same time, intervene before and during a conflict and if we fail to take that step, we are behaving like children who like to play at sending in soldiers, but who are incapable of sending in civilians.	1.1399470248089445
As long as we do not have a balance between the military and the civilian elements, we shall not be credible.	1.2931244096956085
Mr President, Mr Solana, we are very uneasy about replying to you because, in our view, you are responsible for an area that does not really exist.	1.4523490658166147
We believe that poor old Europe can only speak with one voice to say nothing or, and this is possibly more serious, that it can only resolve its diplomatic contradictions by simply tagging along with American politics.	1.2292247349083592
In the lyrical mode of illusion and evasion that they are so fond of, at Sintra, the Fifteen decided to equip themselves with an action force that is 'pretentiously' called autonomous.	1.1564794569247858
Now, the Union can certainly call the body an 'action force' even though for the moment it is only the mobilisation of a few funds and the mustering - on paper - of men, weapons and logistics.	1.4898087128185946
But to believe that this muddle can be autonomous is another matter altogether.	1.0599635639048495
What interests will this so-called force defend, in view of the fact that the countries of Europe do not have the same interests?	1.3286795984021649
Let us just consider for a moment.	0.7049704163628778
What is the basis of armed action?	1.2854225665640253
It is the defence of a territory, the protection of a country and in general of interests considered to be vital?	1.4118456575671632
Just what is an army in the absence of a home country, in the absence of territory - because Europe is incapable of clearly defining its borders - and in the absence of clearly identified vital interests, which the Fifteen have, for good reason, never dared to discuss.	1.4004115679835962
In short, what purpose can an armed force have in the absence of any policy?	1.1218584616233622
We fall back on a kind of ersatz army based on humanitarian rights, a kind of army in the service of vague ideas, of an ideal, the dangers of which have many times been shown in history.	1.2620711113594327
A foreign policy presupposes that one has a clear definition of oneself and of one' s own interests.	0.9603053865665195
But the CFSP will never be anything else other than a cover for the national interests that already manage to dominate the system.	0.9851794538137554
Who cannot see that in this case we are dealing with the twosome formed by London and Berlin, escorted by their respective henchmen, and who have no concept of their own diplomacy as being distinct from that of Washington, seeing themselves at best as bit-part players.	1.1727968076107165
Mr Solana, you yourself are a perfect illustration of this, as it were, structural complicity, passing smoothly from NATO to the CFSP as if they were one and the same. Of course, in reality, they are the same thing.	1.272659258602988
It is still the old imperial service.	1.005223195032218
It is not without some amusement that we have seen you, in your pathetic rivalry with Mr Patten, present this delightful and most charming argument: one day you told a German newspaper, "I am the one that the Americans phone up" .	1.3801638044484539
You might have added, Mr Solana, 'to give me their instructions' , because that is what we see, in fact.	1.458451476482808
In the case of the Balkans, just like everywhere else, one day the United States wants us to destroy the place and the next day they are asking us to rebuild it.	1.2790847781744596
Yes, Jean-Claude Martinez was indeed right to interrupt you, Daniel Cohn-Bendit. In every case, it is follow-my-leader syndrome.	1.2391081055497712
Do you think I am going over the top?	1.3140452891258962
Every day the news brings more proof of our subservience.	0.7843865020953846
Echelon is one of many examples of this, giving an image of Europe that is quite different to the one we like to envisage here.	1.355354856018826
The experts speak of a cultural problem, I think they might be right!	1.4257196480434713
On behalf of the combined European right, I must say to you, Mr Solana, as High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, we do not have confidence in you.	1.3851281811518847
You say that you are against war, but as Secretary-General of NATO you started a war.	1.1210845360541426
A war of aggression, slavishly carrying out American military policy, in a sphere that was not that of the North Atlantic Treaty, against a state that had never been a member, that was not threatening any international borders and in violation of the rules of international law that establish the principle of non-interference as well as those governing the declaration of war.	1.3493702306946733
Today, even Mr Cohn-Bendit - and that is saying something - can gauge the results of the disastrous policy that he so wished for.	1.427069796833023
We also have several questions to ask you that show our concern, that is the least one can say.	1.4217528249985405
First of all, in your view, does the common foreign and security policy aim to protect the security of the Member States of the Union, as one might think, or do you recognise their right to intervene anywhere in the world?	1.5198816566970295
Secondly, if you do recognise this right, then what standards of international law and political morality are you going to base your decisions on?	1.499061050743777
I can already hear your reply: humanitarian standards.	0.8029064970274598
In Kosovo, it was for humanitarian reasons that we systematically destroyed all the civilian infrastructure in Serbia.	1.1725307173448634
When the US killed 2 000 people in Panama, it was not to impose their politics, it was to combat drug trafficking.	1.3641794975858275
When they landed in Somalia, before having to withdraw in disarray, it was not to guarantee their takeover of the oil route, it was to restore hope.	1.3722985670971768
'Restore hope' , do you remember?	1.1196958546292561
In a nutshell, can you not see that nowadays all these evil deeds are committed for humanitarian reasons.	1.043040122934441
Finally, you spoke about using the great resources of crisis management.	1.3081868099620695
Not to make war, of course, but to protect peace.	1.4625352971298529
But these are always the words that those who conduct preventative wars use to justify their actions.	0.9930046956328433
Can you assure us that there will not be a preventative war against any State you care to mention, particularly those which, in their elections, do not ratify the policy adopted by the other Member States of the Union?	1.3279508418238388
Mr Solana, these questions convey our concern.	1.1938517226925718
You say that you are against war, but you would not be the first warmonger to swear that.	1.2995858094988835
May God spare us the disastrous consequences of the bombastic principles that you have just put forward.	1.0690363200679278
Mr President, it goes without saying that the development of a European security and defence identity will have a huge impact on the three countries which joined NATO last year: Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.	1.2310531547983592
As candidate countries of the European Union, they therefore wish to fully participate in this interesting initiative from the very beginning, that is to say as of now.	1.3698348486272653
This request, however, was not honoured by the Council at its Helsinki Summit at the end of last year. In the Finnish capital only vague pledges were made regarding consultation and cooperation.	1.4127306148991228
This is why I would like to ask the High Representative, Mr Solana, to what extent Prague, Warsaw and Budapest are, or will be, involved in European military crisis management plans.	1.2850402672114147
Given Poland' s rather critical stance, this question is all the more pressing.	1.1791736316596861
Its reservation is captured in the following, rather blunt wording: avoid American isolationism and European separatism.	0.9965953624954549
As one might expect, the Polish Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Bronislaw Geremek, has expressed this concern in more diplomatic terms: "The development of a European defence identity should not be at the expense of NATO' s unity.	1.3992390450318604
If anything, the European defence identity should serve to strengthen NATO" .	1.157431804281229
We all very much share this opinion.	0.7558250372017574
Minister Geremek is certainly not the only leader among the new NATO Members from central and eastern Europe who feels excluded from this crucial process today.	1.0702974196856356
The Czech Defence Minister, for example, shares this opinion. In the autumn of last year, the latter stated: "Security within Europe is not divisible.	1.3752433106560444
It cannot be restricted to a small number of countries, with others only being allowed to observe or execute decisions" .	1.104008584280386
These opinions add substance to my question addressed to Mr Solana.	1.0057945587820785
Poles only need five words for this: nothing about us without us!	0.8802346915627081
What do the current EU Member States intend to do about this fair request submitted by candidate countries?	0.9358756830643626
Mr President, I too welcome the presence of the High Representative and his availability to answer Members' questions this time round. On his first appearance in November this was not possible, although this was not Mr Solana' s fault.	1.4075196938162151
It should be acknowledged, however, that he noted down and undertook to answer as quickly as possible the questions asked by Members.	1.3089577155578098
We should also acknowledge the efforts which Mr Solana is making towards achieving a more effective, visible and coherent Common Foreign and Security Policy for the European Union.	1.2323136611553533
In this respect, I agree with the previous speakers about the need to have a comprehensive policy which includes not only military elements but also civilian, diplomatic, humanitarian and police elements, to which Mr Solana referred.	1.3127143129171162
The Portuguese presidency has made great progress in establishing a series of provisional or interim bodies.	1.0692601918847833
In record time it has organised this Informal Meeting of Defence Ministers and has highlighted a whole series of milestones on the long road towards this Common Foreign and Security Policy.	0.9198207033028812
One of these milestones was the meeting in Sintra which I would like to ask Mr Solana about.	1.3317777065576963
This meeting was based on two documents, one being a British document on the Headline Goals and the other a document on the permanent military bodies of the European Union.	1.0882908080789881
Mr Solana, would you be prepared, at your next appearance before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to explain at length to the committee members the content of these documents discussed at the summit? I should like to ask Mr Patten and, through you, the President-in-Office to also attend and answer the same question.	1.3179914794575585
Secondly, to what extent do you support the comments and statements made by the French Defence Minister that the Member States had to allocate 0.7% of GDP to defence expenditure?	1.3019139381086255
I would like to hear your opinion. Do you share this view or do you feel a more significant contribution is needed from the Member States in this respect?	1.4169727520919557
Thirdly, what assessment would you make of the 'Crisex 2000' exercises which have just ended in which, for the first time, the European Union took part in a series of initiatives with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation?	1.371922435729759
Fourthly and finally, if the Member States asked for this, would you be prepared to chair the Political and Security Committee? In this way you could contribute all your experience as Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers, High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, Secretary-General of the Western European Union and a former Secretary-General of NATO.	1.237584309168505
Mr Solana, as the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I shall limit my speech to those subjects.	1.1082822359784061
You have, Mr Solana, heard the force of the criticisms made by the Members of Parliament who do not accept the appalling situations in Kosovo, Chechnya and elsewhere.	1.1961578514931681
For my part, I do not wish to give up hope.	1.1651492715741918
And today, as far as you are concerned, I acknowledge your efforts to build a European security and defence policy that is worthy of the name and which has not hitherto existed.	1.3699101323811376
Indeed, we are still a long way from having achieved the desired objective, in any case, the objective that I wish to achieve.	1.5083218618457201
But I do give you credit for your intense work, the number of meetings held, your efforts to create a rapid intervention force, your specific efforts to prevent crises, to manage them or stop them through civilian means and, if necessary, by military means.	1.309034713498093
I should like to take advantage of your presence here today to ask you two questions of the "what is to be done" variety.	1.3567550282969265
The first concerns the forthcoming European Councils in June and December, without counting the extraordinary Council meeting in Lisbon.	1.0557477765961907
What are the main priorities that you hope to achieve at the next summit meetings?	1.2681066992336651
And finally, what do you most need at these next summits?	1.4744719582051313
My second question is different, although it is not unconnected with the previous one.	1.3143303590818498
It concerns the next IGC.	0.9122506839239323
Do you not think that the agenda of the IGC should include the question of European security and defence policy in order to supplement the treaties, if it appeared that, as the texts of the treaties stand at the moment, they do not allow for a real defence policy to be established?	1.5329893745980678
I believe that the Italian President of the Council mentioned this point at your meeting on 24 February.	1.406977094244803
Can you tell us your position on this subject?	1.0023062137955319
Mr President, Bosnia and Kosovo have shaken Europe.	1.137304396153739
At long last, the European Union realises that it cannot afford to always give the Americans the political and military initiative.	1.2731661633632263
The decision to set up our own peace force is excellent.	1.008828317017351
However, if Europe wants to take military action at crucial times, the Treaty must include a flexibility clause.	1.5090688122501772
Mr Solana can play an important role in this.	0.8032438632071603
He is not stupid. Certainly not!	0.9267330858191956
He is a driven man, a competent man.	1.0982030593467458
But the question remains as to whether this accumulation of responsibilities exceeds even his level of competence.	0.974512666779805
In addition to being Secretary-General of the Council, Mr Solana is also Secretary-General of the WEU, as well as High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. He also heads the Unity Policy Planning and the New Early Warning Unit.	1.361018240002903
One wonders whether he gets any time to sleep, Mr President.	0.9809287656672891
From a democratic point of view, I actually find this accumulation of responsibilities unacceptable. This is exacerbated by the fact that Mr Solana is, of course, not a democratically elected politician, but a high official who is not accountable to any parliament.	1.472477264912625
His position threatens to eclipse that of Commissioner Patten, as has been illustrated again today, in fact.	1.2724005905576123
It appears that, as European security and defence policy takes shape, the Commission and Parliament are increasingly being left out in the cold.	1.4185369484017663
This too is unacceptable in my view.	0.955854354966023
Naturally, every attempt should be made to make European policy more efficient, but this should not lead to unwished-for concentrations of power.	1.3669632132512382
Mr Solana must keep Europe awake without nodding off himself.	0.6420379631842893
Mr President, peace is the European Union' s very raison d' être. I am pleased about the fact that Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana have already underlined this repeatedly.	1.4103973049600664
We have also opted for a common and joint development along the road of democracy, cultural diversity and tolerance.	1.2337244375031653
But look at us now! We are observing the misery in Chechnya in a position of powerlessness, and regard the wars in Africa with indifference, despite the fact that we have close ties with so many of these countries, given that they are ex-colonies.	1.3546488009216333
Some of them are our ACP partners.	0.8566275407293237
The war is an extension of degenerated underdevelopment.	0.914156579368965
In Kosovo, we stepped in with military means, having been unable to prevent the war in ex-Yugoslavia.	1.2878825565636571
We are now unable to guide the peace.	0.99238022995736
This is why Europe is not credible as a Union.	1.3143221992880731
I do not believe, Mr Solana, that we can restore this credibility by military means.	1.3981839083329528
As representatives from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we all come from nations and regions which have never gone out to war with foreign countries, but we always needed to fight those who came to oppress us.	1.1334548893875147
We are very sceptical about your current plans to form a military capability in the short term. This is not because we are against European defence, but European defence can and may only be the outcome of a sound, democratically-based decision process in respect of foreign affairs.	1.2920678316157308
At the moment, Europe does not have a foreign policy to speak of.	1.4472278843937125
I can hardly believe that we will ever achieve this at intergovernmental level.	1.1686238281399273
In my opinion, it is far too easy to sit down with the military and gather up all the military equipment, which are such nice toys, after all.	1.3452332020223317
I am very sceptical about the fact that Commissioner Patten cannot inform us in an equally credible way that he has drafted a prevention plan to stave off further degeneration, underdevelopment and conflicts in Europe and outside.	1.1300075650910109
Because our borders do not stop at the Mediterranean Sea.	0.777030056209764
Mr President, allow me to start with the conquest of Kosovo.	1.002392944219056
It is obvious since the NATO bombing stopped eight months ago that the purpose of the bombing was not to stop ethnic cleansing, not to promote peace and order but to drive a wedge even further into Yugoslavia, to change the borders and to promote the New Order.	1.2864265000531483
Today, we are turning a blind eye to the involvement of NATO occupation forces in the savage ethnic cleansing of the Serbs and non-Albanian speaking minorities.	1.111201159877176
All the signs point towards a second round of attacks on Yugoslavia and this is confirmed by the KLA attacks on Serbs in Mitrovica, the attempt to annex three towns in southern Serbia to Kosovo, the promotion of the independence of Kosovo, the fact that two thousand men have been channelled into Kosovo via Greece, despite the objections of the Greek people and, at the same time, intense efforts by NATO and the European Union to overturn the legitimate government of Yugoslavia.	1.1983923538047239
On the other hand, despite his declarations on humanity and peace, it is clear from what Mr Solana has told us that, according to the Helsinki resolutions, we intend to set up a terrorist army, starting with 60 000 men, in order to strike at anyone who raises their head above the parapet.	1.2748228874457603
Mr Solana has confirmed our view that, in a militarised European Union, NATO will have the upper hand.	1.4657891132517795
That is why this job went to Mr Solana, the Secretary-General of NATO, who is also guilty of the crimes committed against Yugoslavia; the right man for the right job, against whom charges have been filed, calling for him to be tried as a war criminal.	1.2872620254846658
Commissioner, Mr Solana, there is no doubt that you are acting quickly and forcefully and that you have made great progress in certain areas.	1.357859271337616
I wonder, and here I do not entirely agree with the positive interpretations of a number of press bodies and fellow Members, about the direction in which we are going.	1.4361947294469222
I think that contrary to the great process of Economic and Monetary Union, which was an integrated process within the Community structures, today, unfortunately, the common foreign and security policy is entirely an intergovernmental procedure.	1.4043024284503114
My first question, Mr Solana and Commissioner, is to establish whether, together, you have framed strategies that will, at least gradually, lead to the creation of a process that integrates the common foreign and security policy within the Community process.	1.5293364925278934
We have taken fifteen years to achieve Economic and Monetary Union.	1.037003218823992
We can take fifteen years for the defence and security policy and foreign policy, but the process must be clear.	1.442630675467525
I also believe that we should not underestimate, and this is a question that I put to you, the stranglehold and the force of the lobbies of the foreign ministries.	1.4861448040234284
We know the strength that they have acquired over these forty years of building the Community.	1.0755306401911156
Today, they would have everything to lose from the communitarisation of foreign policy, and I believe that they are working with that in mind.	1.4085997368487142
Finally, with regard to Kosovo - Mr Cohn-Bendit was right to emphasise this point - I believe that it is urgent that the European Union raise the question of the status of Kosovo.	1.3504794314409427
Without this status, there will only be instability, murders, provocation by Belgrade and it is a matter of urgency that the European Union should come to a decision on this matter.	1.3791959826076143
Finally, I should like to thank Mr Poettering because I believe that the Belgian initiatives, as we say in common parlance, are getting a bit much.	1.5382829749841753
I think many Member States among the fourteen other Member States would have many reasons not to cooperate in European Union meetings on justice, for example.	1.1851378085687083
Four years after the arrest of Mr Dutroux and his associates, we have still not had a trial, and we still do not know what is happening.	1.2422601542589393
As far as tourism is concerned, there will be many people in these fourteen Member States who could consider discouraging parents of young children from taking holidays in Belgium, for example.	1.2001948381146963
So the time has come and I would ask Mr Solana and Mr Patten to tell Mr Michel that perhaps he is going a bit too far and that finally it may backfire on him, which is what I hope will happen.	1.3446263926210364
Mr President, first of all, I would like to warmly congratulate Mr Solana on this first day of March, for a number of frameworks have been put in place today which have a bearing on European security and defence policy.	1.2398079603058705
But I do wonder what his own view is on this.	1.2279882257761134
According to the documents, cooperation with the High Representative was fruitful.	1.1589439138404771
You said yourself just now that you talked to them over lunch. You have to admit, it would be a rather odd if you were not on speaking terms with them and if there was a lack of cooperation between you and the new frameworks.	1.3470160264018562
But do you not regret the fact that you do not preside over them yourself and are not their leading light?	1.1624768884980352
I - and I believe many with me in Parliament - would like you to be the driving force behind them and would not want you to run the risk of being sidelined to some extent.	1.2695275256177858
Over the past couple of months, High Representative Solana and Commissioner Patten have, during discussions, among other things, with members of the NATO Assembly, tried to separate the defence policies of the EU and NATO.	1.3024711013063257
One gets the impression in fact that they both think that the Petersberg tasks are ideally suited for inclusion in the EU defence policy in due course.	1.1220480662876349
The Treaties also point in that direction, although they allow for a more general defence policy which ties in more with the traditional line of thought of incorporating our policy into a European pillar.	1.2426037721304142
We would then have a voice in NATO through this European pillar.	0.9708025844585223
Actually, I hear less and less about this.	1.268314399644366
I am under the impression that the European Union has pared its ambitions down to the Petersberg tasks, with Mr Patten taking responsibility for civil affairs, which would include a police and diplomatic corps capable of being swiftly deployed, about which he has talked with enthusiasm, and rightly so, and Mr Solana taking care of the deployment of military troops and military equipment.	1.3588225462723849
It seems evident that they would do this in joint cooperation, which would work very well.	1.3522103102288758
But is there not more to it than that?	0.8848455474658907
I cannot shake off the impression that in terms of defence policy, NATO' s role is actually very much emphasised with regard to collective defence.	1.0446830768598852
The European pillar does not really function any more as such. Europe is not venturing beyond the Petersberg tasks.	1.085293107487147
Is this actually how we want things done?	0.7290053384301023
Moreover, whilst there may be talk of integrating the Western European Union into the European Union, there is no longer any mention of Article V, which is, of course, of direct concern to us. Article V touches upon the wider defence tasks and not just Petersberg.	1.498811349284539
Will it be omitted?	0.688255604283879
At the same time, an appeal has also been made in broad terms to increase the defence budgets.	1.1834876140982233
I think that this is to be welcomed, but this appeal does not really distinguish very clearly between Petersberg tasks and wider, collective defence tasks.	1.34615464503151
I wonder how this will develop.	0.692399898928325
I would like to ask both gentlemen how they view the long-term future.	1.1485421326128002
Is it necessary to give further attention to this during the IGC or will the Treaties inevitably set the ball rolling?	1.023010373577254
I am pleased that this has opened a few matters up in relation to defence policy.	1.230357282545043
I do wonder, if Turkey were to bring in a brigade, would we also have to grant it codecision rights concerning that policy?	1.3421879657535114
The fabric of Turkey' s government contains a few Haider-type personalities.	0.9224291848110262
That would seem odd to me.	0.5847877657167179
Secondly, the Baltic States are also knocking on our door.	1.1596170091604416
Will they also take part in our defence policy?	0.8903754286044337
It is a very interesting position to be in, to say the least.	1.6005985435737509
High Representative, you have efficiently drawn our attention to the progress we made in this field between Amsterdam and Helsinki and to certain decisions which have already been taken since Helsinki, such as the establishment of the three committees and, of course, the decision to provide for the deployment of a 50-60 000-strong military force.	1.2325750984345878
However, this increase in pace accentuates the lack of coordination between these decisions and the on-going Intergovernmental Conference even further.	1.2052491554343856
I believe that we will have to reach a compromise in this area between those who, rightly, are pushing for the communitisation of this policy and those who think that such advances should be the responsibility of the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.329453758806192
A word of warning to the latter: this policy needs substantial democratic legitimisation.	1.156891874017595
We are aware of the importance of public opinion when we intervene in matters of foreign and security policy, and I would therefore ask you, in general terms, of course, whether you feel that the reform could tackle any of the following issues: the new, two-level Commission-High Representative structure; a clear, practical distinction between civilian and military crisis management.	1.255866108768907
At this stage, this could include, for example, collaboration between the Commission and the Political Committee, the consolidation of Community responsibility for non-military crisis management, the creation of a Council of Ministers for Defence, coordination of the Treaty on European Union, the NATO Charter and the WEU, the legal personality of the European Union, reinforced cooperation in this area as well, parliamentary control and, lastly, financing.	1.4314237688680942
Do you think that any of these issues could be included, at least in the agenda of the current Conference?	1.3739642749302805
Mr Solana, I am sitting quite close to you, close enough to see your face.	1.3391851448835268
I think that you have aged, your face is quite lined.	1.3645335442995414
It pains me to look at you and I despair on listening to you; that applies both to what you say about games with little soldiers, as Mrs Maes just put it, and what you do not say.	1.337063297654609
You bear a huge responsibility because the pretext of ethnic cleansing is being used to spill blood in another bout of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and yet you have stood up here, while blood is being spilled in Kosovo, and you have not said a word about it.	1.2595105118003809
You are Spanish; you are from a large country, Mr Solana.	1.2939623277987564
Spain and Franco were not one and the same.	0.754964627369344
Spain maintained its unity, it kept the Basque country and Andalucia and Catalonia and it did well to do so, because no one identified Spain with Franco and no one played around with Spain' s unity in the name of a Fascist dictator.	1.2200465760512007
Today, you are identifying Yugoslavia with Milosevic and you are playing with Voivodina, with Montenegro and with southern Serbia. It is you who has created this mess.	1.3252542513149086
Which is why, unless they are accompanied by clear political solutions which respect borders and autonomy and all the democratic guarantees, all these plans on paper will lead to new blood-letting in the Balkans.	1.134920189724682
Mr Solana, the war in Kosovo and the continuing crisis, have served to reveal a European public opinion that is aware that defending the fundamental values that gave rise to the European Union, throughout the world, should no longer continue to rest solely on the shoulders of the President of the United States of America and that the time has come to share the burden, which our American friends have constantly been demanding since Europe became a world economic power.	1.3300733734885668
Over the last year, the Member States of the Union have, naturally, decided to implement specific measures designed to strengthen the operational capability of their armed forces and the informal summit in Sintra, held the day before yesterday in your presence, has just confirmed the main trends.	1.2514227912200715
I have two questions on this subject to which your knowledge of the subjects concerned and the parties involved should make it possible to provide enlightening replies for our further debates and our work.	1.1657867446865513
The first question concerns the training of this rapid intervention force of 60 000 men, which, as you have said, is likely to be deployed to perform peace-keeping and peace-building missions and be capable of maintaining them on a long-term basis, if necessary.	1.1365175181059939
For the information of our colleagues, I must say here that the corresponding contingents should be divided into three parts: one third to prepare the mission, one third to carry it out and one third for rehabilitation, following often difficult ordeals for personnel and equipment.	1.2413687154448536
This explains why the initial figures given in the press, setting the volume of the forces to be built up at around 200 000 men, is close to reality, which has certainly surprised the uninitiated.	1.1849620769620504
My first question, Mr Solana, will be simple and more direct, perhaps, than those of my colleagues who have spoken before me.	1.204715585150468
You know the French proverb, 'Nothing for nothing' .	1.0696499018798904
Do you really think that the governments of the Union are prepared to pay the corresponding price at a time when many of them, apparently at least, have decided to continue to reap what ten years ago were called the peace dividends.	1.2946361286045407
My second question is of a more technical nature, but it is important for the responsibilities of the Atlantic Alliance and the Western European Union to be transferred to the European Union as harmoniously as possible.	1.3681688967952332
You have told us, in this regard, that three committees are being set up, a political committee and a security committee, which started up today, and a military committee.	1.5987403773478819
You then spoke of their relations with the third country members of the Atlantic Alliance or associate members of the Western European Union but which are not members of the European Union.	1.2356394237076969
In the operation of the temporary institutions, whose establishment has just been decided, can you tell us, Mr Solana, what status you intend to confer on the members of the Alliance and on the associate States of the WEU which, I repeat, are not yet members of the European Union?	1.4689450821012837
Could they, for example, have a place, at least as observers, in the different political and security committees or in the military committee?	1.634428667973895
You know that they are concerned about the risk of being isolated and I should like to say that I understand their wish to participate with you in bringing this to a successful conclusion.	1.344903502131886
Mr President, Secretary-General, as you can tell, the Members of this House have listened with great interest to your information on the result of the Informal Meeting of Defence Ministers in Sintra and its significance in the European integration process in terms of security and defence.	1.5113644809999345
Thank you too for sharing with us your telephone conversation with Mr Gil-Robles.	0.7614469568451828
However, in terms of foreign policy, I am not sure whether we can advance at the rate needed to meet requirements, as some Members have said this afternoon, without ignoring the problems which you are coming up against.	1.4025942044378152
I will give you an example.	0.7541905984383183
During the recent trip by the President of the European Parliament to the Middle East, which you mentioned, the various conflicting parties were in agreement about asking for a more active presence from the European Union in the on-going peace process in the region.	1.353685502930492
Do you believe that representatives of Community institutions and Member State governments are acting with the coordination and balance required of those who, like us, hope to mediate between two opposing parties?	1.122505572432336
This House is rather doubtful about this and I am not sure whether you share this doubt.	1.2801057711185801
In this respect, as you will know, the European Parliament is working on an initiative to form a common diplomatic corps of the Community. This is clearly not intended to replace the diplomatic services of the Member States but to complement these and possibly improve their coordination.	1.41500640909842
Could you give us an initial reaction to this initiative, without compromising the more detailed reaction which you may be able to give us in the Foreign Affairs Committee?	1.273629384268786
Mr Solana, it has been said many times in this House that prevention is better than cure.	1.3977752040176987
Of course it is, but there is no reason why Europe cannot equip itself with the means to intervene when prevention proves unsuccessful.	1.175551932353777
In any case, it is prevention that I would like to discuss today.	1.376027666458974
War is threatening to break out again in the Gulf.	0.8281722745468474
As you know, the Iraqi Government has refused to abide by United Nations Resolution 1284, and this is likely to lead, within the next six or seven weeks, to a refusal to issue entrance visas to the committee monitoring the destruction of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.	1.244320022695505
If this happens, the United States' Government and the British Government have given it to be understood that they will resort to military intervention.	1.36177378009187
A visit to Iraq and meetings with the Iraqi leaders and leading figures, particularly Mr Tarek Aziz, convinced me that there is actually a possibility of persuading the Iraqi Government to cooperate in enforcing Resolution 1284.	1.1373859155675627
However, the responsible authorities of the Western countries need to make it clear that, once the mission of the United Nations committee has been successfully completed, the embargo will be lifted and normal trade relations will be able to be resumed.	1.3959171674974564
I would like to know what you and Europe are doing, Mr Solana, or what you intend to do in the near future, to stave off this threat of war.	1.4427030707670638
Today, we have the chance to prevent it; tomorrow it may be too late.	1.1549821087829686
I would also like to know whether, in this context, it would not be possible to do something to induce the Iraqi Government to take a humanitarian step and to release some information regarding the 615 missing Kuwaitis, or to set them free if this is within their power.	1.3529377097481279
As we sit here, hundreds of thousands of people are in enormous peril from the floods in Mozambique.	0.8158861944999488
This has not just happened.	0.7972329733995451
The flooding has been going for weeks, and yet only now it seems there is an assessment of need.	1.3274200691507836
The level of practical assistance from the Community and from the Member States has been pathetic.	1.2261365324972902
For a long time, many of us have sounded a warning that the European Union was spending too much time on its potentially damaging and essentially political project of establishing military decision-making structures, when instead it should have been concentrating its efforts on the improvement of its civil instruments, particularly for humanitarian intervention.	1.3600325530036785
I acknowledge Mr Patten' s efforts in this direction, but what a pity that the governments of the Member States had not devoted as much time to sorting out their capacity for disaster relief and humanitarian assistance as they have in the dangerous business of creating military structures that will ultimately duplicate and undermine those of NATO.	1.1515734770115726
Of course, there is a relationship between military resources and humanitarian assistance, and there are serious military deficiencies in the armed forces of many European countries.	1.2589690715033683
These are of long standing, but are being addressed already within NATO.	1.3488032482257322
I have not yet heard a convincing security-policy explanation of why the European Union needs to establish autonomous, decision-making capabilities for the use of military forces outside of the NATO structures unless it is to create bodies which will rival NATO.	1.2609145979646719
After all, the EU Member States are either full members of NATO or sit around the Euro Atlantic Partnership Council table.	1.153018558450164
NATO is largely European.	0.5133834998084759
Finally, Mr Solana, I would just like to ask you what point there is in having the much heralded policy planning and early warning cell in the Council Secretariat if still we are taken by surprise by yet another humanitarian catastrophe.	1.286998166361435
Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, with regard to the war in Chechnya, we have all noted the particularly restrained and almost accommodating reaction of the international community in general and of the European Union in particular.	1.466259405190866
Now, what has happened and what is still happening in Chechnya is similar to genocide.	1.2701264073520118
How else can we describe the complete annihilation of a regional capital of 400 000 inhabitants, the unremitting and inordinate bombing of towns, villages and districts where, in amongst the whole of the civilian population, there are perhaps a handful of Chechen fighters?	1.1839908685471932
How should we describe the sinister filtration camps, which are comparable to concentration camps, in which the population is suffering the most dreadful humiliation and from which able-bodied men between 15 and 65 years old rarely get out alive?	1.1079800650032283
How can we describe the rapes, the looting, the deliberate fires, the deportations, which are called "cleansing" , that recall the worst episodes of the Middle Ages in Europe?	1.4409681309356073
And what can we say about the leaden shroud that is crashing down on Russian and international journalists and with the banishment of the humanitarian organisations and any international commission of inquiry at the sites of the massacres?	1.0400791285490254
If that is realpolitik, if we really do not have any means, Mr Solana, as High Representative of the CFSP, and Commissioner, I put this question to you both, let us at least use the means that we do have, namely, the aid programmes to Russia.	1.5796523094230268
The war in Chechnya proves, if proof were necessary, that the duty or the right to intervene stops at the borders of the great powers.	1.4226569275710708
Let us therefore ensure that in future any euro spent in the Russian Federation is spent to alleviate the suffering of the people who are the victims of war, to the exclusion of any other objective.	1.1517302626468735
Mr High Representative, you have spoken to us of the progress made to date in relation to the decisions taken at Helsinki.	1.2911291134393386
Some of us here are passionately in favour of creating a distinctly European security organisation to defend peace in the world.	1.0688929631463642
Of course we recognise the role of the Security Council, as the Helsinki resolutions clearly state, in maintaining international peace and security.	1.4902031499488513
However, we note that you have said nothing to us about the fact that the role of the Security Council, as referred to at Helsinki, was contested recently.	1.459405653012412
The point is: does the political will exist to grant real administrative autonomy to this mechanism, which will cover the entire spectrum of Petersberg decisions?	1.2894816743613136
What about the infrastructures?	0.5140768088448848
Is there some sort of provision which will allow the system as a whole to have this administrative autonomy?	1.1625866823406206
Secondly, what will happen to the European defence industry which, after all, comes under the more general activities relating to this system?	1.4571042653121824
Will current programmes continue to be implemented?	1.1072404582746547
Finally, if the Treaty needs to be amended, how do you think this amendment will be implemented, following the report to be submitted in Feira? How will it be incorporated into the more general procedure for amending the institutional framework of the Treaty and how do you think this will fit in with the possibility of a system of qualified majority voting?	1.3997520244555497
Has any thought been given to the matter?	0.9475449213944143
Has it been discussed?	0.4422446655932041
And to what extent has collaboration between you and the relevant Commissioner brought about concrete results and created some sort of framework strategy as to how you and the Commissioner hope this system will prove truly efficient?	1.136900991909804
Mr President, I seem to recall from my study of European history, that the 1809 Convention of Sintra was a controversial peace agreement which probably lengthened rather than shortened the Napoleonic wars and nearly cost the Duke of Wellington his job.	1.0750034152193042
I hope this is not an omen for this Sintra Agreement.	1.3120646111854946
That said, I would like to congratulate the high representative on the progress that has been made so far.	1.263686761090411
But it has to be admitted that much of what he said is the progress in institutional matters, and the real test of the European defence identity will be in its ability to produce capability and capacity, rather than nicely formulated institutions.	1.363101816649896
And, to that end, I am not clear as to the extent to which we have progressed on developing heavy lift capacity to be able to get these 60 000 troops into operation, or what progress we have made on autonomous intelligence capacity, particularly given the American statements that they are not giving intelligence to Europeans until they can deal with security.	1.3847807429844765
We have all heard some of the tales emanating from the Council of Ministers building in Brussels.	1.113219926812645
To what extent are we going to get some form of convergence on defence expenditure, because some Member States spend considerably more than others.	1.1930729537486482
And indeed, some Member States are not geared for mobility.	1.3954299798888337
They are very static in their military forces, and unsuitable for this sort of warfare.	1.13203250672243
Can I perhaps also turn to Mr Patten as well and ask, in terms of the conflict prevention work we are going to be doing, to what extent will it be possible for us to look at long-term conflict-causing situations such as environmental degradation and shortage of water and then incorporate them into mainstream EU policies, particularly in development, because there is no point trying to rapidly respond to something we have had years to put right.	1.3281923967282216
And finally, can I also endorse Mrs Schroedter' s comments that we do need to have a Parliamentary dimension in this defence development.	1.4519292171957983
We cannot leave it simply to governments.	0.7024251712088058
I strongly support the decisions taken at Sintra.	0.7606722975281908
They constitute a significant step towards establishing an effective European Security and Defence Policy.	0.9256488311887833
The creation of the interim structures and the plans that are now being put into place to provide the military capacity for achieving EU policy objectives are positive steps in the right direction.	1.1756764049855009
The recognition that the 60 000 strong military force will be involved in both peacemaking and peacekeeping is also appropriate.	0.8793548914255984
However, while all these developments are indeed welcome, I would like to address a matter which I have raised in this House on previous occasions.	1.7200346339310328
I am anxious to know how effective the EU' s policy planning and early warning unit has been.	1.0282044110491546
While Commissioner Patten' s statement later this evening on the unfolding tragedy in Mozambique will be opportune, I would like to know if the policy planning and early warning unit provided advance information.	1.0735048900861979
Would the High Representative be prepared to say to what extent this unit, which has been strongly supported by the committee of which I and Mr Titley are members, assisted in providing early information, analysis and an indication of the policy planning options open to yourselves?	1.351806842807558
I would also like to support Mr Titley' s comments on an effective role for the Parliament in this whole area.	1.1798452296505064
If we are to realise our ambitions in the field of foreign policy, then effective anticipation and preparation for all sorts of crises, particularly humanitarian ones, are essential prerequisites.	1.346183645105785
When Mr Solana last spoke to this Parliament I was highly critical of the fact that he hardly mentioned at all the idea of conflict prevention; and today we have him mentioning quite a lot about conflict prevention, but no proposal whatsoever about taking it on board on a serious way.	1.2494736388358156
We have a lot of proud talk about 60 000 troops being prepared in 60 days to be available for a whole year, but we currently have crises in Europe and on the borders of Europe and elsewhere which this Union is failing abjectly to deal with.	1.2896768740886628
What we need are 60 000 civilian policemen and women in order to try and deal with these situations.	1.214804193924608
We have not heard any information from Mr Solana about what leverage is going to be used in relation to Russia and Chechnya.	1.1854758546669375
We have not heard anything from Mr Solana about what diplomatic intervention he or the European Union is making in a serious way - serious diplomatic interventions - to stop the slaughter in Chechnya.	1.423803192153304
We have large gaps in what we are arguing for, in principle, in relation to human rights.	1.1949487256889932
We mustered the capacity to intervene in relation to Kosovo, and we are now making a complete mess of Kosovo by failing to put adequate resources and staff and people in there to deal with a situation and demonstrating our inability to deal significantly with conflict prevention.	1.1721398257404239
So, I would ask Mr Solana to explain to this House the position of the European Union in relation to Chechnya.	1.542366088725805
What are we going to do seriously to bring that appalling situation to an end?	1.1397265173827782
We have levers we can use with Russia if we choose to use them, but we are choosing not to use them.	1.2671101107964196
Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, I have two questions for you, Mr Solana. How, with credibility, are you going to be able to continue promoting closer cooperation on defence and military issues if the Member States are not prepared to comply with common commitments?	1.4526185870352362
Meetings are all very well, but it is the result that counts.	1.5467978592757476
I also wonder what kind of plans you have to induce governments to ensure that a force of 60 000 troops becomes a reality and not merely figures on a piece of paper.	1.0974308585883867
If we look around, the reality is that the CFSP is in danger of becoming nothing more than talk. Take, for example, Germany' s defence savings.	1.217271360492611
These are not only of concern to the defence minister, Mr Scharping. Instead, they also affect the whole of Europe.	1.4949013475303856
In my own country, Sweden, the objective, and the commitment towards playing our part, is to supply 2 500 men for EU operations.	1.2763402247608764
In the present situation, the national defence can only supply approximately 1 500 men, due to reduced defence spending.	1.161642610773
If we translate this number into figures for the EU countries as a whole, which is not an unreasonable thing to do if no review is to take place, we shall not have 60 000 men but, at best, 35 000 to 40 000 by the year 2003.	1.4055614650946682
My second question concerns the following matter. Some weeks ago, you were evidently misquoted in the German-speaking media, whereupon your press service put out a statement correcting matters.	1.1148206365567093
I should like, however, to know the background to this, namely whether, as High Representative, you have been toying at all with the idea of giving Austria special treatment in the context of your assignment and, if so, on whose mandate and with how much leeway.	1.493050848405615
I am very grateful to have this opportunity of contributing to the debate on the statement made by the High Representative.	1.0994939275130469
I will not detain the Parliament for long but perhaps I could make one or two points and begin, which is sometimes rather dangerous in any Parliament, by drawing attention to the relationship between rhetoric and reality.	1.293517565933385
Mrs Pack did that in her remarks and anywhere that she is prepared to blaze a trail I think the rest of us should be courageous enough to follow.	1.0988071471661323
I would just like to say a word or two myself on that particular subject.	1.0265126227109567
I spoke last week at the extremely interesting session that was organised between members of the NATO parliamentary assembly and Members of this Parliament.	1.0301468774073528
Many of you were there on that occasion and I think that it is fair to say that you could have cut the scepticism with a knife among many of the NATO parliamentary delegates when we spoke about Europe' s ambitions in the area of CFSP.	1.2133696765812927
This was particularly true with some of the American delegates who were there but one or two of the others as well.	1.1330877496840437
As I said in my remarks, I felt when I was speaking to some of them that they did not know whether to laugh or to cry and it is a reminder to all of us of the tests we have set ourselves and the tests which it is imperative that we meet over the coming months and years and in that context the High Representative' s remarks today were extremely encouraging.	1.4830635116678577
	-0.0
We have come a remarkably long way in a remarkably short time, but there is still a very considerable distance to travel and over the next few months and years we are going to find ourselves, for example, facing up to difficult questions about resources.	1.2718327579621074
Many people will argue that of course all that is required in Europe is for us to make better use of our existing resources but I suspect there will be a growing debate in our own countries in the Member States about whether that really is enough, about whether that is going to secure the sort of security policy which we wish to be more responsible for in our own Union.	1.3898062737543928
I would just like to say a word about the non-military aspects of our security policy, of conflict prevention and crisis management.	1.2645808249288264
Rightly, the concentration today has been on the military side but we have not forgotten about the non-military side either and Mozambique reminds us of the importance of remembering that.	1.183659471417911
We will be bringing forward to the Council before Lisbon our proposals on a rapid reaction facility so that we can provide assistance where it is required, not in months or years, but in days or weeks.	1.4051033243193194
We are establishing a Commission crisis centre as the operational interface with the situation centre in the high representative' s policy unit.	1.0047523253167527
Additionally, and this is for me the most important area of all, an area where we are breaking new ground, we will, soon after we have put forward our proposals on a rapid reaction facility, be bringing forward proposals as well on non-military headline goals.	1.4331088058208634
It is, I repeat, breaking new ground but it is very important that we do it for a number of reasons and policing in Kosovo, policing elsewhere, is the most dramatic and obvious example.	1.3972000302829153
It is not just the sort of policing that we identify with community policemen on the street corner.	1.1251665108380713
I grew up as a kid hoping I would be allowed to stay up on Saturday evenings in order to see a television programme about a community policeman called Dixon of Dock Green.	1.120715386273368
I have just been writing a report before I came to this job, and writing a very good report, just to respond to my honourable friend, on policing in part of my own country.	1.450131928853002
I remember talking about community policing to some American police experts and saying 'What in your view is the ideal community police officer' and the reply was 'a black grandmother' .	0.9994661218303398
But that sort of approach to policing alas is not what is required in Kosovo.	1.0837369522824496
We have armed forces, we have all got experience of training community police officers.	1.1749351374007069
What is actually needed in those circumstances is something between the armed forces and community policing.	1.0411634432097798
We need somebody who has the ability to detect crime but who also has an enhanced ability to deal with really difficult public order situations as well.	0.939538098197761
That is the sort of thing that we have to develop in the European Union and we have to face up to the fact that there are resource consequences.	1.4047438842526936
So again, rhetoric and reality.	0.7136657914805886
Now Mr Titley referred to conflict prevention in the broadest sense and asked what intellectual contribution we were going to make to this debate.	1.026849807321297
One thing I would advise him to do is to listen to Radio 4 at the end of March to the first Reith lecture where he will hear the Commissioner for External Relations giving an extremely moving and convincing lecture on this whole subject.	1.1607586939176588
But perhaps I could just say one or two things this afternoon.	0.9187520952926799
I think there is an umbilical cord between neglecting human rights, between neglecting habeas corpus, between neglecting all the usual rules of good governance, between tyranny and between environmental degradation.	1.1695604074172548
All those things come together.	0.542367015696087
We talk about the complexities of our eco-system but there is an eco-system of values and political institutions which is just as important and absolutely crucial if we are going to make life better for people in countries like Mozambique and make life better for people rather closer to home in the Balkans as well.	1.2354891010960283
So, in the coming months, we will be producing communications from the Commission, for example, which have a direct bearing on the whole question of preventing conflict or managing crises.	1.585217051915214
We will be producing a communication shortly on an issue which this Parliament feels passionately about, that is, how we can ensure that election observation is conducted as comprehensively and sensibly as possible without diminishing the integrity of the institutions which do it.	1.1090094842893752
We will be producing a communication on anti-personnel landmines, actually the use of sensor equipment.	1.130340043165957
The work that has been done in dealing with landmines has been a success story in Mozambique.	1.201578704212821
They have managed to clear tracks from the villages to the wells, they have managed to clear tracks from villages to the primary schools.	0.8392409581188548
What does one suppose has been the consequence of all that flooding over the last few days, moving those anti-personnel mines around?	1.1648187737832623
We are again going to have to go through the same sort of exercise.	1.004001445819032
What we have to be looking at is the way an issue like that connects with our policies elsewhere.	1.2404601823997405
We have to be looking at what we do with the stocks of anti-personnel landmines in Ukraine, in Moldova, the ecological consequences of dealing with those stocks, the financial consequences of dealing with those stocks, the political consequences of dealing with those stocks.	1.3123987180468064
So the point I want to make is that all these things are intimately related.	1.1978307826059966
We have all the instruments, we have all the instruments that we require but we have to pull them together much more effectively than we have in the past and that is the challenge which the High Representative and I face in the next four or five years.	1.5744832688375836
Now, I hope that in facing those challenges we will have support which consists of adequate resources as well as spectacular rhetoric.	1.3276602611674775
We all know that there are a number of reasons for the development of a common foreign and security policy and I will tell you three of them - Bosnia, Albania, Kosovo.	1.2483653050767485
	-0.0
Those are three reasons for a common foreign and security policy and we will be tested on how successful a common foreign and security policy we develop above all by how we handle things in the Balkans and do not lose sight of the fact that there are quite a few of our critics, quite a few American politicians, quite a few senators and congressmen who say 'How can we possibly take you seriously in developing a common foreign and security policy when you cannot even handle problems on your own back doorstep?' .	1.1334612591880457
So the big test for us is going to be in the Balkans. I hope that all those heads of government, all those prominent politicians in our Member States who promised the earth in the Balkans, who promised Marshall plans and who make all the other promises in the Balkans will be around when the budgetary authority decides how much we have got to spend in the Balkans.	1.4203706599255872
I would very much hope that we can all live on a planet which is also inhabited by the European Council, the General Affairs Council and Ecofin.	1.4374975978371103
All on the same political planet together and making sure that there is some harmony between what we promised the world and what we can actually deliver.	1.3050049603984424
In the last few months in this job I have heard promises that we will do more in Latin America, I have heard promises that if there is a Middle East peace settlement, we will be there to pay for it.	1.408399241085759
I have heard promises that we will establish a stability pact in the southern Caucuses.	1.0329896360810804
I have heard promises that we will secure democracy in Indonesia by giving more assistance to Indonesia	0.8738283700501662
Where is the beef?	0.3112466502145991
And that is not a contribution to any recent political controversy.	1.2607775972806967
That is the question that we have to address again and again in the coming weeks and months in my view.	1.6478007535048895
One reason why I am so passionately keen on carrying through an effective reform of our external assistance programmes is that I do not want to continue to be put in the situation where whenever one puts a question like that about the gulf between rhetoric and reality, the response is 'Oh but we know you are not running things efficiently, we know that you have not spent all your commitments, we know there is some money in your back pocket' .	1.3709037080957842
I want us to be in a position in which we can say: 'It is not like that any more. We are running things as efficiently and competently as we can' .	1.5763036714877732
So, Member States, we think that it is time that common foreign and security policy had a bridge between Council conclusions, between yards of communiqués and what we can actually deliver on the ground and I think that if we can achieve that the job of the High Representative will have been made a lot easier and the conditions of life for an awful lot of people around the world will have been made a lot better.	1.446908186056881
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.	0.618741388554918
I would also like to thank you for allowing us to sample your British sense of humour in the course of our dealings with this very difficult issue, for it makes things a little more interesting.	1.2251748938157785
Women in the decision-making process	0.2168665062204142
The next item is the declarations by the Council and the Commission on women in the decision-making process.	1.1345132396393618
Mr President, two centuries ago, during the French Revolution, a very famous woman, Olympe de Gouges, was executed and proclaimed mad because she had supported equal rights for men and women.	1.291132328102425
Two centuries later, we have achieved a great deal in Europe.	1.4682142461251948
The last century was marked by three periods.	0.7948543673650067
The first period was a period of institutional change, change in the legislative framework and huge constitutional victories in all the Member States as a result of the fight by the women' s movement, as a result of major decisions by progressive parties and as the result of action by enlightened men and women.	1.2923721150735774
This was followed by a second period, in which the worth of female models was recognised.	1.0296337672606222
There were women everywhere.	0.4387769478309426
Prime ministers, members of parliament, ministers, in the professional arena, doctors, lawyers, pilots, generals.	1.127767121107677
We are now in a third period: in this third period, the composition of the bodies which wield political and economic power needs to be changed.	1.3222409696449602
The composition, or rather the change in composition, will also bring about changes in policies - policies which need to take account of the merits and experience of both sexes.	1.2466791201124874
Ladies and gentlemen, the first few months of the new millennium have been marked by two important events: the first was the election of the President of Finland, Mrs Halïnen.	1.4981166970948914
For the first time in Finland, the women candidates outnumbered the men.	1.1243290029475326
And a woman was elected.	0.5777856473209587
The second event took place in France, which passed a law on the equal representation of men and women as a result of the declaration made in April 1999 at the 'Women and Men in Power' conference, at which the ministers responsible undertook to implement specific measures and policies to change the power ratio.	1.3152842386720411
We must congratulate Prime Minister Jospin for ratifying this commitment in the clearest and most categorical manner.	0.887805941306517
A great deal has been said and numerous policies have been implemented in the Member States.	1.2628055393547917
But the figures tell the true story.	0.7365052191808024
And the figures still give Europe cause for concern.	0.6614846084383387
24% of members of government are women and there are an average of 22% in parliament, although this fluctuates from 6% in some Member States to as many as 40% in others.	1.4322771867729136
The number of women on committees who wield power and frame policies is very small.	0.9891060481180509
Even in countries such as Germany and Belgium, which have specific legal commitments on the representation of the two sexes, the involvement of women on various committees is no more than 18%.	1.3338607644131646
What we need, therefore, is to promote specific policies.	1.4568171943156154
We need a policy mix which includes long-term political commitments, as in Sweden and Finland; they now have governments in which women account for 56% and 44% of members respectively.	1.3401464078628391
We need organisation and statistical monitoring.	0.5993815490343064
We need controls and suitable structures which reflect the culture, mentality and specific problems of each area.	0.8319682815471099
And, of course, these policies need a budget, they need to be given financial teeth.	1.3725086803104865
Increasing the number of women or, as the French prime minister put it, increasing the influence of women in the decision-making centres, is the best way of renewing the policy, of reshaping the approach to the question, of injecting political thought with new ideas and new experience: the new ideas and experience which women can inject by reason of the different way in which they live and grow up.	1.421930665134442
The recent initiative by the Finnish presidency to develop indicators recording and reflecting the representation of women in the decision-making centres is extremely important.	0.8866131480960362
These indicators include national parliaments, regional councils and town councils and give a complete picture of the degree of representation of women in every Member State.	1.007164488255951
I think that creating and supporting statistics is a very important political issue and that the facility to set targets, compare performances and bolster our efforts is an important political tool.	1.2385289754469848
The programme which I shall present for the fifth women' s programme includes a similar initiative for systematic monitoring.	1.1757979532681635
Although legislative measures and institutional intervention by Member States have been effective as far as the decision-making centres of the parties in power is concerned, the same cannot be said for the private sector.	1.3859376910209258
My contacts with large European and multinational companies in Europe have brought tragic results to light.	0.910894184873583
There are companies at European level which employ thousands of workers, sometimes hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the world and yet fewer than 2% of the directors and managers are women.	1.1946274914546655
Nor must we underestimate the representation of women in economic decision-making centres.	0.955714269348045
Here too, specific efforts will be made of course; naturally they cannot be of a legislative nature, but they can operate on the basis of an exchange of best practices; in all cases, my initial contact with the chairmen and directors of these large companies has had positive results.	1.3595714156022745
As you know, Europe is endeavouring to solve the problem from within.	1.0162832262610073
A decision has already been taken on quotas of 40% for each sex on all teams and on all research and technological development programmes.	1.1021593082987353
It was approved by the House in May 1999, when the need for women in research and technology was stressed.	1.3081296016823942
We in the Commission are obliged to set a specific and clear example and all the Commissioners are working together, as can be seen from the reform of the Commission, to achieve 40% representation of women on all the committees of the European Commission.	1.5200692688436368
Ladies and gentlemen, there are often objections, crypto-progressive objections, as to whether there should be a binding undertaking on the representation of women at the centres of power.	1.1649274555280635
No one ever asks in a federal state if all the members of the federation should have their say.	0.9789964443493371
And at the level of the European Union, the question of whether the 15 Member States need to be represented on every committee will never be asked.	1.2290529780270856
Why then is it curious and why do we have reservations when it comes to a legislative commitment on the representation of half the population.	1.0524503429181506
I should like to be absolutely categorical.	1.5314132372790974
There should be no reservation, no reservation whatsoever about a legislative commitment on the representation of women at the centres of power.	0.8749169289752363
(Applause)	-0.0
Women make up half the population, half the strength of the planet.	0.8832963655641758
Excluding women from the centres of power means, first, democratic failure and, secondly, under-exploitation of human resources.	1.3375682696702544
We face a unique challenge and the time is ripe for combining economic and political expediency with respect for basic democratic principles.	1.1149215457334218
I am optimistic that we shall succeed.	1.2877219428883997
The bet before us is a bet with time.	0.8055262023191805
Future generations of women must not be sidelined.	0.8556998400838336
If need be, we must use all possible means to force the situation.	1.24458078297508
(Applause)	-0.0
Mr President, firstly I must thank Mrs Belém Roseira for taking part in this debate and for her interesting speech on the subject.	1.3779994389879109
I must also thank the Commissioner for being here and for her words.	1.2384851270219737
The various political groups generally agree on the easily verifiable observation that women are under-represented in the decision-making process, in both the political and the economic and social spheres.	1.2228912001761763
Nobody nowadays disputes that women should participate in political life, in the parties and in the institutions but it is not easy to agree on how this participation should be achieved.	1.3774893176210108
The equality between men and women which most affects the lives of women and therefore society in general is equality in work. This involves both equality in accessing work, which implies equality in training, and equal pay for the same work, so often defended and yet far from being achieved.	1.3752171980388248
We are convinced that the participation of women in the decision-making process will be beneficial to society as a whole.	0.8606715421068979
Women always have a different viewpoint from men. This serves to enrich and complete the picture of the best solutions to the problems in daily life which people like us, who are dedicated to active politics, undertake to solve.	1.1977386793595646
The difficulty lies in finding the right solution to allow women to have a greater presence in positions of responsibility and therefore in decision making.	1.1536720354728336
In some countries of the European Union a compulsory quota formula has been adopted which immediately produces a more equal presence of women.	1.176533695334827
However, this is not always the best solution as there are not always enough women ready to enter a difficult and competitive world which they regard as essentially masculine because it has traditionally been reserved for men.	1.2825589875797776
Women are not participating in political parties and in the working and social world at a level of fifty per cent.	1.0942154244839792
The real percentage is much lower and it is this participation at the grassroots which we must promote in order to ensure a greater presence of women.	1.3565145689195484
There must also be a clear and real will to allow more women, who are ready and able, to assume responsibilities and commitments in political life and therefore in the decision-making process.	1.347245218427956
There is no clear agreement within the PPE-DE Group in support of the compulsory quota system.	1.1374016934384346
Some Members have even come out against this.	0.798451782098749
Personally, I would not want to feel like a quota, to think that I was in a particular job because I was a woman.	1.6885633948120216
This is a feeling which men will never have and it is an important difference.	1.3634494607213994
Mr President, I should also like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner for good speeches on their part which I think provide hope for real optimism, especially given the will and commitment radiated by both women.	1.1648070209014687
I think it was an excellent example the Commissioner gave when she said that no one would have dreamed of having a situation in which the fifteen countries of the European Union were not equally represented but that it was a different matter when it came to equal representation for women.	1.3626124659024808
It could hardly have been made more abundantly clear, what we are concerned with here.	1.2883677606692219
I do hope that the Commissioner will have the necessary perseverance to also produce the necessary reforms within the Commission - but then, of course, she is young and full of energy.	1.4021987262876736
I am convinced that it will be hard work, when all is said and done.	1.054448510639061
If the Commissioner asks for support from Parliament, she can in any case count upon the support of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.	1.1150626455885726
We have a very strong interest in seeing equality introduced to the Commission and in seeing the necessary basis for decision making secured so that the Commissioner can implement her views on equality.	1.3181266705539691
I would say to the Portuguese minister that I completely agree with her that what is at issue here is the fact that you cannot obtain equal rights without equal power.	1.3156836549056592
That is absolutely crucial.	0.9139962897367864
It should also be remembered, however, that no one voluntarily relinquishes power, and that applies to both men and women.	1.2870295098302569
Men have never wished to surrender positions of power when they had them, but there are also very few women who have been willing to give up their positions of power, and I am thinking here, in particular, of positions of power in relation to children.	1.4619427038236148
Moreover, I would also say that this may also be one of the reasons why there are so few men here today.	1.4876385609690193
Inevitably, we should like, for the same reasons of power politics, to be allowed to have this debate more or less to ourselves.	1.5867966936041638
What I want to emphasise by saying this is that it is a matter of both sides' surrendering power.	1.3635158036549417
The Commissioner emphasised that what is needed is a very broadly-based political mix, and she specifically mentioned Finland and Sweden.	1.1698846319379639
Just for the record, I would say that she might well also have mentioned Denmark.	1.2427228124305196
And I say that, of course, because I come from Denmark.	1.431083872889499
In fact, 45% of the Danish government is made up of women, and that is, in reality, a touch more than in Finland.	1.4794755451908914
We still do not have a female president but, on the other hand, we have a queen, and that must no doubt, in certain contexts, amount to the same thing.	1.429871213122964
I should like to broach some of the points the Commissioner mentioned, notably the question of financial resources.	1.3065601567151515
It is crucial we accept that there is a price to pay if women are to have equality in the short term.	1.309665523416182
In the short term, we also need to invest in making sure that children are properly cared for and, of course, also properly educated.	1.124757354724358
The issue is therefore one of appropriate structures.	1.0102118997459206
One might well wonder if traditional industrial culture has been a particularly good thing, and I am therefore very happy that the Portuguese ministers are to participate very actively in the Lisbon Summit, which is, of course, to be partly concerned with IT developments.	1.3269835839993247
I think that this field offers some quite distinctive opportunities for women, specifically because it is characterised by flat, rather than hierarchical, structures.	1.1933732240769757
In Denmark, we have, in any case, seen developments to suggest that quite a lot of women entrepreneurs are on the way up.	1.1892178010382077
There are two points which have not been seriously mentioned and which I should just like to mention here finally.	1.2937845619987867
The first is the issue of the media' s influence.	1.1399599166657237
I think it is very important that we should investigate what kind of stereotypes the media establish.	1.016532123403008
Do we have a special problem in this regard?	1.7025423281757468
I have to say that I do not know the precise answer to that question.	1.021588680055621
I have a suspicion that this is the case, but I am not certain.	1.7871974159605646
The second point is the enlargement of the Union.	0.9121723266072668
I think it very important that we should emphasise straight away that a number of demands are to be made in connection with enlargement as well, specifically that the new Member States should arrange to be represented by both men and women so that in that way they are improving the status of women in the countries concerned.	1.4081983973146601
I would also like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their statements and I agree with the Commissioner' s statement; it is time that fine words were translated into action.	1.2309338668614251
We all know to what extent women are under-represented in decision making at all levels because we have the statistics and they speak for themselves.	1.237611737641999
I agree that accurate statistics too are essential because it is only when we see the figures changing that we will know we are beginning to overcome the problems.	1.2561397185024634
It is systematic monitoring which will reveal this.	0.699417586745257
Mainstreaming is a long-term commitment and process.	0.8808506801593907
In the meantime, we need positive action and this means the use of quotas and other measures.	1.4078260379834493
We can learn from the successes mentioned, not only by looking at the actual numbers of women that were elected, but the effect that has had on the nature of government to illustrate that everyone benefits from a truly representative system.	1.3498630561052611
I am pleased to say that in Wales, which I represent, 40% of our national assembly members are women as the result of positive action by the political parties but, on the other hand, we have only 4 women MPs from Wales in the House of Commons which is only 10% of the total; so statements of principle, of support in principle, are not enough because they have not worked.	1.4467482183512603
If we believe in the principle of equal representation of women and men in decision making we need to commit ourselves to the actions that are necessary to make it happen.	1.3441209293887182
Mr President, at the Second International Conference of Socialist Women held in Copenhagen in 1910, it was decided that the main demand of the time, that of a woman' s right to vote, should be linked to the women' s question as a whole and that (as also stated in the relevant resolution) Women' s Day must be accorded an international dimension and be thoroughly prepared for.	1.3991612123262251
It is also worth noting that International Women' s Day has since been banned in all those countries in which fascism and racism came to power during and between the war years.	1.1772029009303158
In 1910, a woman' s right to vote was on the agenda.	1.0778626034523597
Today, we are focusing upon the ways in which more women might be able to participate in the decision-making process.	1.120589484040191
Women are no homogenous collective.	0.5891778098173522
Women belong to different social classes.	0.6543723795121025
Women have different individual needs and interests.	0.6841573585574595
Irrespective of where we are and notwithstanding our class, race or religion and whether we stay at home or go out to work, it is nonetheless a fact that, in all areas of society, the structures are such that we are thoroughly subordinate to men (albeit with a few individual exceptions, it is perhaps best to add).	1.3446803076252387
In my own country, Sweden, a number of political parties have, in recent years, voluntarily introduced quota allocation by gender as a feature governing the ways in which political assemblies are constituted and run.	1.013213282975432
This has led to an increase in the number of women involved in political decision making which, in turn, has provided opportunities for further research.	1.0975731332633591
What happens when more women take an active and equal part in political decision making?	0.9001862959786917
What has so far emerged is that the agenda has changed - and when the agenda changes, so too of course do the types of decisions made.	1.4409351748131294
When the talk turns to quota allocation by gender, the word "qualifications" also crops up.	1.0709895539074539
What is interesting is that the qualifications demanded are rarely defined.	0.8635658928170519
It often looks as if men today, as in the past, always have the least defined qualifications.	1.236388834269817
Being a man therefore seems, in itself, to be synonymous with maximum competence.	1.2552606534440494
This way of seeing things I consider to be proof of spectacular incompetence on the part of many of today' s decision makers.	1.163400963693716
Earlier this year, we requested, here in this Chamber, that 8 March be made into an international holiday.	1.3501251262276097
In anticipation of this request being met, I now want to take the opportunity of wishing all socialist women success with the "Women' s World Marches" which are to begin this spring on International Women' s Day.	1.348889322386673
This is a world-wide activity which will focus upon violence against women and female poverty throughout the world.	1.0105697880908235
Finally, I want to say, as Commissioner Patten said when he drew the previous debate to a close, that the ideal police officer would be a black grandmother.	1.4098675430996954
We do not have any such officers, but black grandmothers are in fact to be found.	1.4452511384846078
Mr President, the place of women in politics is an important matter that is worthy of more than our trying to outbid each other in terms of political correctness.	1.2518690774059165
Undoubtedly there are too few women involved in politics.	0.6571426712738162
It is not absolutely certain that the predominance of men in the party machinery alone is responsible.	1.1357443113179913
In France, 95% of elected representatives are town councillors.	0.8997522072120182
The vast majority of them are not members of any party.	1.039886193374845
In the authorities of the French departments, the leading French party is that of independent elected representatives, in right-wing or left-wing categories.	1.3273128324097583
In order to be elected as a local councillor, you just have to want to be elected.	1.5100293896416415
But access to national responsibilities often depends upon the introduction to politics provided by such local mandates.	0.9007339810245468
Our Group wants to encourage the fair representation of men and women in the institutions of the European Union.	1.0103500573226405
That is why we reject the policy of quotas and positive discrimination, whether it is in favour of women or supposed social minorities.	1.341051286375502
The policy of minorities, while neglecting the deep-seated unity of the human family, to establish superficial divisions, is a dangerous threat to the cohesion of the social fabric and the equilibrium of our democratic system.	1.4289633757935478
On the one hand, if we establish quotas for women, why do we also not create quotas according to age or ethnic group, quotas of Catholics, of workers, of those who wear glasses.	1.3165909565839993
The establishment of social quotas in favour of the very smallest categories would be no more ludicrous than establishing quotas of women.	1.2521377914584761
With such a philosophy it would no longer be necessary to organise elections or administrative competitions.	1.0447031365213257
It would be sufficient to determine the composition of the ministries and assemblies by means of a statistical calculation.	1.103291780612564
The policy of quotas can only increase the disaffection of the voters with regard to politics by once again giving them the feeling that everything takes place behind their backs.	1.025461244646616
On the other hand, such a policy shows a deep contempt for women.	1.1046691548814578
A woman must not attain political or administrative responsibilities automatically thanks to the implementation of the quota but by having her own merits and skills recognised.	0.9438728308614872
Ladies, have you so little pride that you would be prepared to hold a ministerial office or wear the sash of an elected representative by virtue of the mathematical odds of the quota?	1.120581161807394
Women deserve more than a quota.	0.8485634043221341
It is by reviving the principle of meritocracy that we shall improve in quantity and quality the presence of women in the decision-making process in quantity and quality.	1.1066138549950795
Minister, Commissioner, everything you have just said has been very well expressed, even if a few male colleagues, if there are still any in the Chamber, perhaps gnashed their teeth.	1.4842017757874277
I know that there are also some women who do not wish to hear of quotas or even of positive action, because they believe that this positive discrimination humiliates them and marks them forever in their careers.	1.2633743314376824
But the statistics prove it: the positive action, even the quotas, - if they are not applied blindly, without distinction - have increased the number of women in the decision-making process.	1.416182160783283
That is why we are justified in stating that the use of quotas, as a transitional measure, contributes to balancing out the participation of men and women, particularly in political life.	1.1881424700242906
I should like to take this opportunity to remind the Commissioner of some requests and initiatives of this Parliament which her predecessor did not follow up and which are closer to our hearts than the quotas.	1.2373254558950593
First of all it concerns our report, which was adopted last year on the occasion of International Women' s Day in Strasbourg, which requests the Commission to submit to us a new proposal to amend the 1976 directive on the implementation of the principle of the equal treatment of men and women.	1.4610618266150033
According to the Treaty of Amsterdam, there was no longer any reason to maintain the positive action as a tolerated departure from the principle of equal treatment which only recognises an individual right, and not a right that belongs to the society that wishes to achieve this equality democratically.	1.3013297201666334
Things being what they are, nobody should dare any longer to dispute that the right of equality of men and women is a fundamental right of a democratic society, requiring equal treatment and equal opportunity be achieved by a package of active measures, including positive action.	1.2654114970260384
Therefore, Commissioner, you can go ahead.	1.5642577450643615
You do not need to wait for a new amendment to the Treaty.	1.261361087906879
May I just remind you once again of our request for an amendment to the 1976 directive which has been watered down and misapplied with regard to the equal treatment of self-employed people, including assistant spouses.	1.1725013004770128
No action has been taken on our report which unanimously proposed a European framework status for assistant spouses.	1.0755757966763344
Here again, Commissioner, the ball is in your court.	1.189853959468331
Do not take too long to send it back.	0.9900287805114377
I would like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their speeches and for committing themselves before the European Parliament on the crucial matter we are discussing today.	1.354040315217067
The presence of women in decision-making bodies, in particular, is a question of democracy.	1.2821662271076089
All citizens, both men and women, should be able to see, to feel that they are genuinely represented by those they have elected and those who rule.	1.338311036781495
If we consider the fact that more than half the population is made up of women but that that there are many more men than women present in these decision-making bodies, it is clear that we are still far from true democracy.	1.3704257806100275
However, it is also a question of political agendas.	1.3953356330439484
In addition to making up the majority of the population, women are also the most dynamic element in society: it is women who have made the greatest contribution to the creation of new enterprises in Europe in recent years; a greater percentage of young women obtain irregular work contracts than men, and in many of our regions, they are the main feature of the innovation, training, performance and flexibility development model.	1.3373207823215032
Out of a sample of women who work in and around Milan, where I live, 90% said that they do not have enough time to do all they need to in a day.	1.2518484496434499
Women work an average of 60 hours a week, which is 20 hours longer than men.	1.1828878715714926
The price paid by women for following their desire to be protagonists in all spheres is that they never have enough time.	0.9666188047401146
If this is true, and it is, any appropriate policy which aims to find positive solutions to these problems must start from this point.	1.24445073142472
Laws, programmes and interventions must be implemented which are well-constructed, coordinated and audacious, in order to encourage the formation of new cultural, economic, social, institutional and political ruling classes whose modernity is characterised by the involvement of women.	1.0691532718113226
Much has been achieved on many issues in Europe, but we are still far from resolving the question of equal representation.	1.295483749836515
I agree with the Commissioner that it is time for the European political sphere - the entire European political sphere - to represent women and men on an equal footing, and for decisive action to be taken in this matter.	1.5714397692057638
Mr President, before I came here for today' s sitting, I was watching Finnish television.	1.4752403392681521
In Finland, an honorary company of the Finnish army was saluting the new President of the Republic, with the words "Good morning, Madam President."	1.4200094728338872
You perhaps know that, in Finland, the president is not just the leading public figure or political leader, but she is also commander-in-chief of the armed forces, so this was quite an interesting and historic occasion.	1.4720645950482878
During the Finnish presidential term, a report was produced that reveals an image of the whole decision-making process, and, on the basis of this report, I hope that the Commissioner proposes legally binding ways of improving the position of women in decision making.	1.388222056228817
I urge you all, women of the Right, to listen to Mrs Lulling, because she told us why quotas were needed and, if any of us has sufficient experience of political life, it is she.	1.5223647240619158
Finally, I would like to say that it is now essential that we also raise this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.183912309683165
I appeal to you, ladies and gentlemen, not to vote in favour of the proposal tomorrow to moderate the contents of point 4, to prevent gender democracy from being discussed at the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.2372278480261083
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, despite the progress made in terms of legislation and despite the complaints that we all utter from time to time on the subject of sexual inequality and sexual discrimination, the causes of these practices are still present in the amendments that have been tabled to this resolution. This means that we need to amend policies in various areas if we are to guarantee that women can participate on equal terms in the decision-making process.	1.2812491154301868
We know that this area is proving more difficult to resolve, both because women still bear the main responsibilities in family life and because there is still prejudice and personal interest standing in the way of genuine participation by women in various areas which involve greater responsibility.	1.3066991667850052
The truth is that the scant participation of women in centres of political representation and decision making demonstrates a democratic deficit which is incompatible with genuine democracy.	0.9694524492716089
It is therefore essential for the various directives on equality to be complied with and for the Council, the Commission and each Member State strictly to respect the commitments they have made, particularly at the Beijing Conference.	1.476277461241064
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I am a right-wing Member of Parliament but I have the same battles as my colleagues in supporting and assisting fellow citizens in my country to gain power and access to decision-making posts, which should be feasible not only in the political arena but clearly also in all sectors of society.	1.3380893523594528
Quite simply, I would say that there are several ways in which to attain positions of power and I am particularly against the system of quotas, because I believe it is especially contemptuous of women and I come from a country where parity has just been achieved.	1.4646203423589481
It is quite logical, it is consistent!	1.5225274217466942
It should have existed for a long time because women represent more than half of society and it seems quite clear to me that it is natural for them to represent at least 50%, if not more, of those within decision-making bodies and, inter alia, in the political arena.	1.4233699354638043
So, there should be no positive discrimination to include women.	1.2265421556695582
Woman are capable of getting themselves included because they are pragmatic and full of common sense.	0.8092198934043102
When I see that we are asking for training for women in politics, I want to say - no, definitely not.	1.4347653777338054
Let us impose training for male and female candidates in politics - but why especially compel women to undergo training?	1.0744409816981517
That simply amounts to acknowledging their inferiority.	0.5607803729357587
But I do know that we have never felt inferior to men, particularly in politics.	1.402988870672761
So I believe that we are conducting this battle to assist our fellow countrywomen to achieve decision-making power, to gain responsible posts in the political arena, but I believe that it will only be achieved if we completely change the way people think.	1.408133176782014
We shall all have to be sufficiently strong to force our political leaders to voluntarily impose women' s participation in the political decision-making process.	1.0183641222515505
Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, "Women are half of heaven" , a successful man once said.	1.3807686263644428
But when it comes to important decisions and priorities, there is a lack of women' s voices.	1.0947642582056263
Women, who constitute more than half of the population, are heavily under-represented within political, economic and social fields.	1.3082085575051026
That is unacceptable in a democracy.	0.9875657701796773
Where equality is concerned, the gulf between the actual and the ideal is nowhere more apparent than in the area of decision making.	1.1080320408332243
If we are to achieve a balance, a concrete action plan with a definite timetable is required.	1.2907660860384804
An important part of such a plan would be a benchmarking system to guarantee women' s full participation in power structures and decision making.	1.1025025787940903
I am therefore delighted that the Commissioner is well disposed towards a system of this kind.	1.2298736654011042
I propose that the EU' s objectives for women in the area of decision making should be based upon the averaged-out achievements of the three most successful Member States within each area, with the Member States each submitting a report annually which will then have to be evaluated.	1.361330868388622
Women are the foremost victims of human rights abuses such as rape, sexual offences, domestic violence and the trade in women, but they are under-represented on the legal and legislative bodies which pronounce upon these crimes.	1.182881193611108
The latter are consequently accorded low priority, and the perpetrators are often not prosecuted.	1.2182410544232078
Women are the prime victims of armed conflicts but are under-represented in peace-keeping efforts, conflict resolution and reconstruction work.	0.9667092274104918
In the resolution, we therefore urge the Member States to increase the proportion of women involved in all aspects of conflict resolution and peace-keeping.	1.3385550554176078
The call for women' s participation in decision making on an equal footing with men is not only a demand for social justice and democracy; it is also essential if women' s experience and knowledge are to be utilised to the full.	1.239209660519491
Not to use women' s talents in decision making is an unacceptable waste.	1.052473813141069
Women should not only be "half of heaven" but should also be entitled to take their share of responsibility for decisions which affect our entire planet.	1.150367720478598
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Diamantopoulou on the excellent speeches they have made today.	1.0942832160614642
We have high hopes for what you will achieve.	0.8365818210404287
We are at the start of a millennium and a century which we hope will be decisive for women and for their opportunity to occupy decision-making positions.	1.1530800479838568
We want this opportunity to bring substantial changes to our lives in society at large, we want democracy to be synonymous with equality between men and women, and we do not want women to be excluded socially or economically as is still happening today.	1.2903211729579493
Furthermore, we want values that women consider important, such as peace, fraternity, equality, justice, security and environmental protection, to be the guiding spirit for life in the European Union and, if possible, throughout the world.	1.5655813587218683
In order to achieve this, women must be given the opportunity to combat the inertia of a society which has, until now, been essentially imbued with masculine values.	1.215314551764385
We know from our own experience that freedom and the ability to decide are not given freely but must be fought for.	1.0232654574880307
Let us continue to fight and ensure that this century brings us victory: not over men, not over anyone, but the victory of equality between men and women.	1.3308763589050663
We therefore cannot afford to miss any more opportunities, and the great challenge confronting all Europeans now, and particularly women, concerns the new economy and the new information technologies.	1.4058226894231476
The Lisbon Summit to be held at the end of this month is very much geared towards women.	1.231417950227782
The rate of employment in Europe, which is much lower than in the United States and Japan, must be increased.	1.3443000234985483
We must therefore have many more women in work, and working in the new jobs in which the EU has a shortfall.	1.694174439844929
I would therefore like to ask the Council and the Commission what proposals they will be presenting at the forthcoming Lisbon Summit to ensure that the new economy and the new Europe we want to build will definitely include equality between men and women.	1.3123786517459473
Mr President, Commissioner, the reason why I was so pleased with your intervention was that you had the courage to list the Member States where the political representation of women is a success, such as, for example, in Finland, France and Sweden, and equally, you had the courage to list the Member States where things in this respect are not going so well, such as, for example, my own country and Greece too, which you forgot to mention.	1.4402693385728944
Moreover, I have heard that for the next elections, it appears that very few women will feature on the electoral lists in Greece.	1.5274332003944402
I think this is a very sad state of affairs.	1.0959313471043417
I appreciate your courage because I think that it is high time that we in the European institutions started to offer concrete instruments to help put more women on the political agenda.	1.2740024655136908
This is why I think it is important that this Parliament continues to press for quotas and that this is openly included in the resolution.	1.4487323533917935
I myself, Commissioner, am a product of quotas. I do not believe that any of the MEPs will be able to prove that I am any less competent as a result.	1.3527014750020727
It appears that the meritocracy in a number of our European countries is still so biased in favour of males that women simply do not stand a chance.	1.101111460964108
It is true that a number of countries in the European Union have already introduced quotas, and you yourself made reference to Belgium, Commissioner, where it has not really taken off.	1.5700482977156611
Hardly surprising, would you not agree, Mrs Avilés Perea, not because we failed to find the necessary candidates, but because recent scientific research, instigated by the Commission, has shown that quotas are, in fact, only useful if women are placed in the appropriate safe seats.	1.4842425730837423
This is why we need to be sensible about applying quotas.	1.1219937627675864
Indeed, Minister, we should strive for a democracy based on equal representation as a new social contract.	1.427987765937904
But we should draw the necessary conclusions from this.	1.0353729592810619
The electoral system which corresponds most closely to this model is the one-for-one system, as is being applied in Sweden on a voluntary basis.	1.281352506868653
I would suggest the following: where possible, apply it on a voluntary basis, where there is reluctance, impose it.	1.123442391779766
I hope that in the fifth action programme, Minister and Commissioner, benchmarking will enable the best practices of those countries to be carried through, for it is time that our groups gained an understanding of this.	1.4417106633072525
Mr President, I too should like to congratulate the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council for their solid recommendations and, above all, for their proposals.	1.3421534217233948
Because it has been said that men do not usually get involved in discussions on women' s rights, I thought I might contribute the views of a contemporary politician and intellectual, Francis Fukuyama, to today' s debate.	1.3026340866225725
In an article entitled "If women ruled the world" , he maintains that if women were more involved in politics, the world would certainly not be so wedded to violence.	1.26096118340808
Athena, the goddess of wisdom and war, may have been a female model in Ancient Greece, but the influence exercised by women today can act as a catalyst to stop militarisation and promote peace.	1.2876211642706976
There are, therefore, serious grounds, over and above justice between the sexes, for distributing public offices and political and economic power fairly and evenly between men and women.	1.1175739870439734
Women devote their entire lives to the endeavour to protect life and the environment through dialogue, reconciliation, an understanding of different views and resolving differences by peaceful means.	1.059087129307272
These female virtues can offer an alternative to today' s culture of violence and institute a new political culture and a fairer and more prosperous society for everyone.	1.0157784328570596
That is why the Intergovernmental Conference must introduce into the Treaty the principle of balanced representation of women and men in all the institutions of the European Union and in all democratic institutions and political decision-making centres throughout the Community.	1.4513480469971864
Mr President, why do women need their rightful share in political decision making?	1.1799404730206666
And how should we achieve this?	0.7893448902455368
We all agree on the fact that it needs to be done and why it is necessary.	1.5508888471041375
It is a demand for simple justice and for democracy and, as such, a condition for political legitimacy.	1.406891334209561
But if we look into how to achieve this, the opinions are greatly divided.	1.2719846551424734
Is it sufficient to provide information and training and to create practical conditions or should we give preferential treatment, much like the quota system for the electoral lists of the political parties?	1.2687099828592001
And is it then up to the state, in other words the legislative, to impose such measures on political parties?	1.392213826183005
Or should we even consider a system in which 50% of seats are reserved for women in elected bodies?	1.0429586769231278
This discussion, which is being held in some parts of Europe and here too under the French banner of parité, touches the very core of democracy, and is also about the political significance which we are prepared to accord to being a woman.	1.3034495342750156
In my opinion, the political battle should be fought at a political concept level rather than at a gender level.	1.0809467538967936
I am a great fan of voluntary quotas on electoral lists, without which, in fact, I would not be here today.	1.4215180881967888
Like Mrs Van Lancker, I am a product of such a measure.	1.253621295981734
In my opinion, though, the state should not and must not use coercion to interfere in the internal affairs of political parties, at the risk of jeopardising democracy itself.	1.1726791339789135
In other words, the means which we employ to give women their rightful place within the political democracy should not lead to a system of gender apartheid.	1.027344686714123
We would, in this way, violate democracy.	0.9040188385113147
Mr President, today' s debate is devoted to the subject of the composition of decision-making bodies and changes to the decision-making system in Europe.	1.2115503864221255
We have entered a new period in which there is a fairly full institutional framework and in which women are well represented in all sectors, education, work, culture.	1.2060084601807002
The problem which we have to deal with is how to change the composition of the decision-making centres.	1.2661606113266854
The debate is a deeply political one.	1.1645976951698396
There are two approaches.	0.9878287876758682
The first is a policy of persuasion.	1.1849207112747047
Gradually everyone will be persuaded that women can become involved.	0.838258242568369
Three comments: the first is based on the fact that women are able. I can, therefore all women can.	1.587682449215452
How do we respond therefore to the fact that women are excluded?	1.0468581971817976
