Spreading depression is a fascinating phenomenon that can be provoked by chemical, electrical or mechanical stimuli of the cortex.	0.4732535799260516
Spreading depression-like transient depolarizations are observed in the periinfarct tissue after focal ischemia.	0.4484583814003471
The reduction in electrical activity and a negative direct current potential shift propagating over the cortex with a rate of 2-5 mm/minute are the physiological hallmarks.	0.5994985311657985
It is thought that spreading depression and peri-infarct depolarizations might play a role in the pathogenesis of migraine and stroke.	0.43259742931667977
However, these events have never been detected in humans.	0.6334715327299366
This paper reviews the physiological characteristics of spreading depression and peri-infarct depolarizations and discusses their potential role in migraine and stroke.	0.37706546458630164

The results of 13 single-stage reconstructions of large and complex defects in the head and neck by using eight free radial forearm flaps as well as five pectoralis major myocutaneous flaps were analyzed.	0.5126223186354939
No complete flap loss occurred in any case.	0.27798406393614905
The results with radial forearm flap reconstructions proved to be better functionally and aesthetically.	0.5430520750573185
Due to the time needed for the microvascular anastomoses, the length of the operations was sometimes prolonged.	0.6745013009243277
Pectoralis major flaps were found to be more difficult to handle and were used in those cases in which the application of free radial forearm flaps was expected to produce higher risks.	0.6965744181820701
Psychotherapists have the alternative, to design quality assurance within certain boundaries by themselves, or otherwise leave this important task to external instances.	0.5175763651313249

This paper discusses the question, how far quality assurance in the field of analytic psychotherapy has to accept the definitions and concepts from other fields such as industry or somatic medicine, without changing or deteriorating the quality that in the end should be improved.	0.5527702365051741
Differentiation is necessary between the use of the Psy-BaDo for individual quality assurance of the individual psychotherapist and for quality- and psychotherapy-research.	0.6279459130308396
This paper points out new approaches to modifying the present concept of quality assurance for the purposes of analytic psychotherapy.	0.49352960662573214
Cicatrical pemphigoid (CP) comprises a groupf of patients with a chronic subepidermal blistering disease which primarily involves mucous membranes; lesions characteristically heal with scarring.	0.47004239431111866
Immunofluorescence investigations typically demonstrate deposits of tissue bound and circulating immunoreactants of the IgG and less frequently of the IgA class in a linear pattern along the basement membrane zone.	0.3395359354107837
These autoantibodies are thought to play an important role in the blister formation of CP.	0.44580983586780615
Most patients show binding to the bullous pemphigoid antigen 2 (BPag2), collagen type XVII, with a molecularweight of 180 kD.	0.6427661998510285
A smaller group of patients with CP have autoantibodies to laminin 5.	0.5001905385496481
Animal models confirm that autoantibodies binding to these two adhesion molecules (BPag2 and laminin 5) are important in blister formation.	0.6112269551837236
There are other autoantigens described in CP; however, they are only found in small groups of CP patients and most of them are not further characterised.	0.6034972839021073
The described molecules are part of the hemidesmosomal adhesion complex.	0.36462395431870614
Impaired function of any component of this complex may lead to a separation of the epidermis from the dermis; better knowledge about the single molecules and the exact localisation of epitopes within these molecules may lead to further understanding of the clinical picture.	0.6723050318096844
Study objective: The clinical effect of ketoprofen is based not only on the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.	0.6577429316225099
Ketoprofen also acts through kynurenic acid as a central antagonist on the NMDA receptor.	0.31324950052600303
Due to this central analgesic mechanism of ketoprofen, we expected an analgesic preemptive effect.	0.551816518503693
This study was carried out following the Breivik/Stubhaug preemptive effect study design.	0.4560825918748072
Dystopies of the bony orbit are caused mainly by craniosynostosis, facial clefts and encephaloceles.	0.4537476447497833
This article presents the results of the surgical correction of orbital hypertelorism in 24 patients.	0.720383370506881
Using this operation technique, the bony interorbital distance was decreased from an average of 47.6 mm to 22.8 mm.	0.6969613210648732
However, the distance between the soft tissues was not reduced by the same amount as the distance between the bony orbits.	0.612776752637889
The intercanthal distance decreased from an average of 58.5 mm to 44.5 mm, whereby an additional refixation of the medial palpebral ligament resulted in a reduction of the intercanthal distance to 40.8 mm.	0.7609970216659235
A strabismus divergens was seen preoperatively in 18 patients, postoperatively only in 8 patients.	0.5290098730426576
Four of the latter had to undergo operative correction of the diplopia.	0.6077395934603655
We conclude that the operative technique is not reserved only for complex cases of hypertelorism because it shows satisfactory functional and aesthetic results with a low complication rate.	0.6430267201140026
Four years after extensive pneumonectomy on the left side with resection of the aortic wall and patch reconstruction for a T4 carcinoma, 2 years after adjuvant radiation and 10 months after drainage therapy of late intrathoracic empyema, destruction of the infected Dacron patch led to rupture of the aorta descendens.	0.6734929065717999
Successful primary emergency reconstruction of the aorta descendens was followed by venetian blind plasty (Heller) and transposition of the omentum majus for omentoplasty of the aortal wall and reduction of the pneumonectomy cavity.	0.5456894972054274
The rate of prosthetic infections is between 0.3 and 2.5% and must be taken into consideration even in cases of intrathoracic vascular reconstruction with alloplastic prostheses.	0.8141890891124207
After lung resection it is necessary to cover up the prosthetic graft by using autogenous material to obtain prosthetic incorporation into the protective tissue.	0.42682313065632116
In intrathoracic infectious complications, extra-anatomic bypass grafting or autogenous vascular graft implantation should be considered.	0.47612067051785345
If there is no possibility of carrying out these procedures, first aggressive local debridement of the infected vascular wall and afterwards coverage with alloplastic prosthetics with omentum transposition and thoracoplasty are essential to minimize postoperative infection and obtain solid anchorage in the surrounding tissue.	0.5105969627346593
The evaluation of melanocytic tumors represents one of the most intriguing and challenging aspects of the daily practice in dermatohistopathology.	0.6572468989118243
For the diagnosis of malignant melanoma and melanocytic nevi, standardized and reproducible criteria are required.	0.5908235809526674
In case of the diagnosis of melanoma, the histopathological report must include all important data relevant for the prognosis which may also influence the therapeutic procedure.	0.6897544662108056
The following paper summarizes the recommendations of the study group on malignant melanoma formed by the Deutsche Dermatologische Gesellschaft.	0.6036627582552487
Recent studies have shown that acute infections, especially of the respiratory tract, are an important risk factor for cerebral ischemia.	0.8447305542400528
Additionally we know that chronic dental infections may be a risk for myocardial infarction and artherosclerosis.	0.6397372208696752
However, the connection between stroke and dental infections has hardly been examined so far.	0.5586068202185326
Therefore we performed a case-control study using a standardized questionaire and examination.	0.6087751342646459
We investigated 66 patients consecutive to a acute cerebral ischemia/stroke and 60 age- and sex-matched nonstroke neurological patients as a control group.	0.5326899315953356
Dental status was determined by a so called total dental index (TDI) which reflects primarily caries, periodontitis, periapical lesions, devital and missing teeth as well as by a panoramic index (PI).	0.530089009702191
Specifically, older patients with cerebrovascular ischemia tended to have a significantly worse dental status and had more severe periodontitis and periapical lesions than control subjects.	0.5480658985144095
A predefined poor dental status was associated with cerebrovascular ischemia independent from other vascular risk factors and social status.	0.5452799399150308
In conclusion, poor dental health, mainly resulting from chronic dental infections, may be associated with an increased risk for cerebrovascular ischemia.	0.6834060001851922
The results must now be verified in larger studies.	0.3438245891306519
As chronic dental infections are a common and also easily treatable factor, their identification as a risk factor for stroke would be quite important in the field of preventive medicine.	0.6535015449969361
Adjuvant basic therapy plays a central role  in the therapeutic approach to atopic eczema in childhood.	0.7392288164688936
It involves the regular use of emollients and oil baths according to the clinical picture.	0.5326915984790372
Emollients containing urea may cause problems when used in younger children due to their stinging effect.	0.43566295034787145
Glucocorticosteroids still form the mainstay  of anti-inflammatory therapy and are superior to other topical drugs with anti-inflammatory effects.	0.5904509291988932
Antihistamines preferably of the sedative type can be used successfully  during periods of exacerbation.	0.5366765865906862
Systemic use of antibiotics is essential in cases of impetiginized atopic eczema.	0.573647946155684
In cases of bacterial-triggered eczema, the topical use of antibiotics in cases of limited or of antiseptics in generalized disease may be helpful.	0.6427113085098153
The present paper presents data obtained over a 12 year period, on the matrix synthesis and turnover in some 650 arthritic and 180 non-arthritic (N) human cartilages using a standardised in vitro method.	0.676261500103771
When the relative metabolic (synthetic/repair activity) of these human cartilages was compared, it was demonstrated that in osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) cartilages synthetic activity was diminished by approximately 50% as compared with N cartilages.	0.6931385862589294
However, the turnover rate of matrix was not significantly different between Non-arthritic and OA, but was very substantially increased in RA cartilages compatible with the activity of inflammatory cells and proteolytic enzymes released from pannus.	0.6515839993894803
The action of 13 NSAIDs was compared in terms of their effect on cartilage GAG synthesis.	0.45100588904699157
3 of these NSAIDs were also studied in terms of their effect on cartilage collagen synthesis.	0.42000840987132865
Consideration of the results in this study and from published material, led to the suggestion that NSAIDs may be divided into 3 categories in respect of their in vitro action on the extracellular matrix of human arthritic cartilages:   1.	0.7256980144363517
Those such as Aceclofenac, Tenidap and Tolmetin which can stimulate matrix synthesis 2.	0.33313066813681735
Those such as Piroxicam, Tiaprofenic Acid and Aspirin which appear to be without significant effect on matrix synthesis and, 3.	0.5008430819635442
Those like Naproxen, Ibuprofen, Indomethacin, Nimezulide which significantly inhibit matrix synthesis.	0.2847928088745244
It is suggested that the stimulatory action of group 1 NSAID is due to inhibition of locally produced IL1 and consequent expression of growth factor activity.	0.44869985466640544
Other NSAIDs may also inhibit IL1 synthesis or release, but probably do not have a beneficial effect on chondrocyte synthetic activity as they have toxic effects on cartilage metabolism.	0.5275701593522758
These experiments led to the suggestion that NSAIDs such as Aceclofenac would be appropriate for long-term treatment of arthritic conditions provided that one is prepared to extrapolate between in vitro experiments on human cartilage and what may be happening in vivo.	0.45154110254684027
The article begins with a general introduction to the problems of pre-operative anxiety and its impact on the post-operative course development.	0.632524195567293
Then the treatment of a patient who developed an anxiety-syndrome before a necessary heart operation is described.	0.7834322789132807
The treatment lasted 6 hours and included psychotherapy by guided affective imagery.	0.3232271863350414
One and a half years later a follow-up interview was carried out by a colleague of the original therapist.	0.6074856374030777
The interview was based on the assumption that patients are able to give a competent statement about their previous treatment.	0.6100308134037364
The results are discussed under the aspect of therapeutic factors of psychotherapy.	0.5839148303949309
Physiologically, angiogenesis in adults is a controlled process which plays a role, for example, in wound healing.	0.6305860590059532
Pathological angiogenesis is observed in tumor formation and represents a multifactorial process, in which specific angiogenic factors, as well as growth factors, extracellular matrix proteins and cell adhesion molecules are involved.	0.6009687620256571
Tumor growth is characterized by an imbalance in favor of angiogenic over angiogenesis-inhibiting factors.	0.45017812438732724
Some of the most frequently examined angiogenic factors are vascular endothelial growth factor, acidic/basic fibroblast growth factors and the platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor.	0.6240195791986962
The most important angiogenesis inhibitors are angiostatin and thrombospondin.	0.4422916312578898
To date, the clinical relevance of tumor angiogenesis has been shown for several human tumors.	0.8256030965886532
For most urological tumors, the grade of tumor vessel formation, measured as microvessel density, has been associated with metastases, tumor growth and clinical course.	0.6569913524677068
The prognostic value of this feature of malignant growth seems to be higher than that of most of the classical and newer prognostic factors.	0.6269892068928755
Systematic investigations of tumor angiogenesis are becoming increasingly relevant for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies and offer opportunities for the development of new specific therapeutic approaches in clinical oncology.	0.7056985657848531
Introduction: CPR is an essential part of resuscitation.	0.571699669712166
German medical students must take part in at least two low-level basic life support courses, one for a driver's license and one for admission to medical school.	0.5980130039585774
The knowledge and skill of German medical students in CPR performance were studied.	0.39031817863218354
Psychoanalysis is regarded to be mainly disorderoriented.	0.2597952861928181
Indeed, since its beginning, it was characterised by the two-sided orientation towards disorder and resources.	0.7664155720240488
Contemporary concepts of the psychoanalytic encounter, especially actualgenetic conceptions of the analysis of transference, lay the ground for better integrating both aspects.	0.5124190843441414
This development implies new approaches to the psychoanalytic process and technique, and especially to interpretation.	0.7468323643981409
More than before, contemporary psychoanalytic interpretation refers to progressive coping strategies within and outside transferential processes.	0.36736364952526623
During the last few decades, traumatic injuries of the hip joint have significantly increased in number, and traffic accidents have also increased.	0.8045230676384868
Depending on the speed, direction of the forces and the position of the femur at the moment of impact, different patterns of injury occur.	0.6523207127691577
Basically, they are classified as hip dislocations, dislocation fractures and acetabular fractures.	0.545870336153814
These injuries have in common a high rate of concomitant lesions.	0.4260746607750927
Several classification systems have been developed for these injuries.	0.6395600172689415
Commonly, Stewart and Milford's or Levin's classification is used for dislocations and dislocation fractures.	0.37956692264285313
For acetabular fractures, Judet and Letournel's classification and its newer version developed by Helfet (AO classification) are generally accepted.	0.46868439824071395
Fractures of the femoral head, though included in these classifications, are typically described by separate classifications like the one presented in 1957 by Pipkin.	0.6162478570169452
The multitude of injuries occuring in the hip joint requires vast knowledge of various operative approaches.	0.4616478506836916
No single approach exists that would permit the treatment of all injuries in an ideal fashion.	0.4908097435834394
Approaches are either considered limited (Kocher-Langenbeck, ilioinguinal iliofemoral) when they permit access only to a restricted segment of the joint, or extended (extended iliofemoral, Maryland, Ruedi) when they allow all-around visualization of the hip joint.	0.5542186195680453
The choice of the best approach for an individual patient depends on the type of injury and also on patient variables like age, preexisting disease, and concomitant injuries.	0.7018254105778433
The decision is further influenced by the timing of surgery, the kind of fracture stabilization intended and by complications typically seen with certain approaches.	0.554421792051248
The indication for extended procedures is only seen in patients with complex injury patterns involving both the anterior and the posterior column or in delayed cases undergoing surgery more than 3 weeks after trauma.	0.6259321590390752
Extended approaches permit excellent visualization of the fracture, but the extent of the soft tissue trauma is reflected in a high rate of postoperative complications.	0.9140550703619194
After a phase in which extended procedures were favored, recently a trend towards more limited approaches can be recognized because of their lower complication rate.	0.5002755538192282
This is facilitated by modern fracture-reduction methods using indirect techniques.	0.320778547118189
A relation between myocardial ischemia and induction of ventricular arrhythmias can be demonstrated in patients with coronary heart disease - in contrast to patients with primary non ischemic cardiac diseases - using a combined metabolic-electrophysiological investigation protocol consisting of programmed atrial and ventricular stimulation with simultaneous measurement of the arterio/coronary venous difference for lactate, pyruvate, free fatty acids and amino acids.	0.6684582841914154
There are significant metabolic distinctions between both ischemic and non ischemic heart disease under pacing stress conditions as well as at rest.	0.4152936414544457
A 52 year old female with Parry-Romberg syndrome presented with gradual atrophy of the subcutaneous fat and muscle on her chest and back.	0.4838996793841996
The disease process was limited to the C3 to T2 dermatomes on the right side.	0.5467651132570893
In addition, there was muscle atrophy of the right arm and extending down the back to T10, als well as right sided paralysis of the diaphragm.	0.6339430186982434
Sympathetic nerve blockage reduced pain and hyperesthesia; no progression was seen over several months using NMR to monitor the patient.	0.4426526616472136
The Parry-Romberg syndrome has been defined in many ways; in view of this unusual case, we review the literature, attempting to provide a more accurate case definition.	0.6789005173479311
Between 1990 and 1996, 129 children (mean age 4.8 years) with hip pain were examined consecutively.	0.7883048183890851
In group I (n = 100, mean age 4.14  +/-  2.2), transient synovitis of the hip was diagnosed; group II (n = 29, mean age 7.3  +/-  2.1) showed the following diagnoses: Perthes' disease (n = 12), early slipped capital femoral epiphysis (n = 5), Meyer's dysplasia (n = 2), septic arthritis of the hip (n = 2), osteomyelitis of the acetabulum (n = 1), abscess of the psoas (n = 1), chondromatosis of the hip joint (n = 1), Ewing's sarcoma of the os pubis (n = 1), hip dysplasia (n = 1).	0.6648497863793178
Three patients who had synovitis developed Perthes' disease and were assigned to group II.	0.5766770771257477
The efficiency of ultrasound, scintigraphy and MRI as diagnostic tools was tested in the examination of painful hip.	0.6063483507972701
A capsular distension was present in 73 cases and showed a significant statistical difference (t-test, P < 0.001) in group I between affected and unaffected hips.	0.6966312405845907
There were no differences in the measurements of the epiphyseal and metaphyseal width in group I between the affected and the non-affected side (t-test, P = 0.91, P = 0.57) and between the first sonographic evaluation at presentation and at the follow-up (t-test, P = 0.053, P = 0.75).	0.7057621351991319
MRI was performed, because of persistent joint effusion, in 10 cases in group I, and Perthes' disease was excluded.	0.829260783240334
In group II the use of an MRI allowed the diagnosis in 89 % of the cases.	0.7902868572429212
Sonographic examination, together with X-ray examination and serological testing, represent the first choices in the evaluation of a painful hip at presentation and in the follow-up of transient synovitis.	0.6398384680937564
MRI should always be performed when abnormalities are present at the clinical and sonographic examination, and when the X-ray does not allow a clear diagnosis.	0.6767523725341814
A 36-year old woman was presented to our hospital with congenital ventricular septal defect and one-vessel coronary artery disease (75% proximal left main coronary artery) for CABG and repair of the VSD.	0.7353772858750014
After induction, a transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) baseline examination was performed, showing a severely dilated coronary sinus (CS) measuring approximately 3 cm (abnormal >1 cm).	0.5069334991239322
We suggested a persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC) draining into the CS.	0.3727225265547684
PLSVC is a common venous congenital anomaly, with a reported incidence of 0.5% in general population and in 3-5 % of patients with congenital heart defect.	1.0468700842766345
Injection of echo-contrast solution in a left arm vein, visualizing microbubbles passing through the PLSVC into the CS confirmed our suspicion.	0.3984381096389046
The diagnosis of a PLSVC and dilated CS is a contraindication for retrograde cardioplegia because of the loss of cardioplegia into the PLSVC resulting in a inadequate myocardial protection.	0.5514040901946984
It may be difficult to pass a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) through a left internal or left subclavian vein and it may be associated with arrythmias.	0.5729224949282233
A chest radiograph shows the anomalous course of the PAC along the left heart.	0.5239599210614334
Teleradiologysystems can differ considerably in their features.	0.2379253187813779
The most important differences lie in the mode of image data acquisition, data transfer, data safety aspects and the possibilities of interaction between seperate teleradiology units.	0.687663711468478
A selection of commercially available teleradiologysystems is presented and compared.	0.48254231242377105

Over the following weeks his visus improved to  0.5, while the chiasm edema disappeared.	0.7460536748903097
Electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) allows viszalization and quantification of calcium in the coronary arteries.	0.4731128262391605
This has been demonstrated to correlate well with the overall plaque burden in the coronary arteries.	0.6450887076566827
EBCT is, therefore, well suited for the detection of early stages of coronary atherosclerosis.	0.5655301614701571
Especially in asymptomatic patients with several risk factors, staging coronary artery disease by coronary calcium, scanning may allow prognostic assessment and guide preventive and therapeutic interventions.	0.48392012691857794
We report an unusual complication in a 53-year-old woman following ileostomy for Crohn's disease 22 years previously.	0.5687803353124472
A stenosis of the distal colonic segment was the reason for the formation and subsequent rupture of a huge colonic mucocele.	0.6600321971589894

Estrogens have protective and trophic effects on neural systems and modulate the activity of several neurotransmitter systems.	0.3632065657829525
Initial studies support the hypothesis that estrogen therapy in menopause may have protective effects toward the development of dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease.	0.5431882043802658
Furthermore, estrogens may improve verbal fluency, memory, and mood in elderly women.	0.5173813108183632
Still, the available evidence is not sufficient to support general treatment recommendations with respect to estrogens and the therapeutic targets dementia and depression.	0.6380961038240056
A 38-year-old male patient presented with circumscribed scleroderma (10x12 cm) in the left pectoral area.	0.6613934076925041
Hyperaemia of the skin in the area of the lilac ring (morphoea) was quantified by means of Laser-Doppler flux (LDF).	0.6598510453713569
At the lilac border of the morphoea LDF was increased to 420% of the reference value recorded for the unaffected skin of the contralateral side.	0.6161049589341322
Immediately after 13 days of antibiotic therapy (3x10 Mega penicillin G per day, i.v.)	0.5480802800772537
LDF normalized, though clinical changes were hardly apparent at this stage.	0.43935272904682315
By 6 months later, LDF was still in the normal range, and clinical signs, such as induration and hyperaemic redness, had also significantly improved.	0.5492263892931449
LDF measurements allow assessment of the therapeutic response to antibiotic therapy at a very early stage while the clinical situation is still unchanged.	0.6240359866418258
It is generally accepted that the progression of an idiopathic scoliotic deformity with a Cobb angle of between 25  ° and 40  ° can be stopped by brace treatment alone provided that the generally acknowledged criteria for the treatment concerning skeletal growth of the individual are respected.	0.681401016019835
The total costs for a department of anaesthesia amount to a fraction of the total hospital budget that is proportional to the overall number of hospital departments; this means anaesthetic departments are in general not cost drivers.	0.5495132828032548
The medical treatment of erectile dysfunction includes the systemic (oral, epidermal, intramuscular) as well as the local (intracavernosal, intraurethral) application of pharma cological agents.	0.514355724617271
Up to now only yohimbine, a well-known alpha-receptor blocking agent, and sildenafil, a newly introduced phosphodiesterase V inhibitor with predominant peripheral action, have been approved and listed in Germany.	0.6932342922967215
Other oral agents under investigation are trazodone and apomorphine (central action) as well as phentolamine (peripheral action).	0.4035934267921058
For the small group of patients with an established testosterone deficit, the epidermal or intramuscular substitution of testosterone seems to be a reasonable alternative to other therapeutic options.	0.7923605508826114
For the local application of pharmacological agents, intracavernosal injection therapy and intraurethral application ("medicated urethral system for erection", MUSE) are available.	0.5717275835349417
Currently, several promising pharmacological agents with different modes of action and routes of administration are under investigation.	0.5341469638664498
The ultimate goal of these basic and clinical research efforts is to develop a specific and "tailored" therapy for each individual patient.	0.7062183547446058
While the pharmacological therapy of erectile dysfunction will most likely continue to be the therapeutic standard for most patients, it will certainly be augmented by devices (i. e. vacuum erection devices, "functional electromyostimulation of the corpus cavernosum", FEMCC) and surgical treatment options (vascular and prosthetic surgery).	0.7205685746818054
We treated a large superficial basal cell carcinoma (ca.	0.49778421892648234
10x6 cm) on the right breast in a 48-year old woman with photodynamic terapy (PDT).	0.6790338304685989
Fractionated PDT was performed by topical application of -aminolevulinic acid (-ALA, 20%) with subsequent red light (570-750 nm; 180 J/cm2) in three sessions.	0.7516366196630099
Nearly total remission of the tumor resulted; however, a few residual neoplastic islands partly infiltrating the nipple-areola complex could be detected by photodynamic diagnosis (PDD).	0.5867844607202388
These fluorescent areas were marked, excised, and the defect was closed by a rotation advancement flap.	0.6040682283924577
Total excision of the tumor was verified histologically.	0.8565040246855343
By combining PDT and surgery, this large tumor was treated with excellent cosmetic results.	0.5641614420277953
This case demonstrates the efficiency of topical PDT with adjunctive plastic surgery controlled by PDD even in large tumors.	0.409592814982906
In a prospective trial patients were interviewed in two periods, from 1988 to 1990 and from 1993 to 1995.	0.73637789925757
Ninety out of 189 patients (47,6%) with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of malignant melanoma who noted morphological changes in a pigmented lesion reported the mole had been present at least 10 years.	0.6439072499758403
20,7% stated it was present since birth.	0.49016460353243657
156 out of 189 patients (82,5%) noticed changes in the lesion over the time.	0.5344961021791199
Growth, discolouration and elevation were the most frequent changes but no significant early sign of disease was found.	0.5635735963764985
Bleeding and crusting were found with tumor thickness >1,5 mm and thus be signs of an advanced stage.	0.6883944789204762
Almost 6 months passed until half of the patients visited a physician, either because of changes in the mole or in the lesion was detected during other medical examinations.	0.7380265992384044
In the second period of the survey from 1993 to 1995 the physician was frequently consulted earlier.	0.6199373527646589
The main reasons for the delay between identification by the patient and seeking medical cedure were lack of symptoms and the notion that the lesion was harmless.	0.7347049451507128
Only 72 out of 189 patients (38,1%) visited the physician on their own initiative.	0.5442215767464564
The primary evaluation of the "pigmental lesion" was done by a primary care physician in 57%, by a dermatologist in 32% and by others in 11% of our cases.	0.8208349323481395
A diagnosis of a non-melanoma was made and no further steps were initiated by 27% of the primary care physicians and 22,7% of the surgeons, gynecologists or internists.	0.7286640791570332
Only 5% of the dermatologists misdiagnosed the lesions.	0.5500333479026297
In the second trial period from 1993 to 1995 in all physician groups the rate of misdiagnosis increased due to changes in heathcare services in the context of privatisation in our health care system in East Germany.	0.5434589027951706
Whereas 83,2% of the patients first evaluated by dermatologists had a surgical removal of the mole within the first 2 months after consultation, the proportion for those diagnosed by non-dermatologists was only 58,5%.	0.7043977470561689
The rate of primary treatment by surgeons, often with a small safety margin, also increased.	0.695679710784788
In 45 patients with Parkinson's disease, we investigated coping behavior and its correlations to demographic and disease-related data, locus of control, depression, and psychosocial adaptation.	0.677682078322373
Active, problem oriented, and self-reorganizing strategies were predominantly used and regarded as especially helpful by the 27 men and 18 women (age: 56 years; duration of illness: 9 years).	0.6105706457607221
While age and sex were not associated with coping, external locus of control correlated positively to "depressive coping" and duration of illness correlated negatively to "distraction and self-affirmation."	0.588924139111845
Coping strategies regarded as maladaptive and a small degree of internal locus of control correlated to unfavourable results for depression and satisfaction.	0.43688819050036753
The Internet has become a powerful, international source for information, and it has shown an exponential growth because of the ease of access and the immediate availability of information.	0.6114236279585062

The Giessen Ophthalmological Picture Atlas can be reached in the Internet.	0.40331757140303687
It allows a fast search free of charge from all over the world and, therefore, offers an additional option to obtain specific ophthalmological information for various purposes.	0.5084054462920297
Even though the function of the myometrium is vital for the existence of all mammals, there is little knowledge about its ultrastructure.	0.5953146824156925
So far, only the contractile filaments actin and myosin have been identified.	0.6091963234189468
There is no evidence for the existence of other filament systems, either my means of electron microscopy or histochemically.	0.6806221216354622
The indications, operative procedure, postoperative complications and advantages of laparoscopic ileostomy and colostomy as compared with "open" enterostomy are described and demonstrated in our own patients with Crohn's disease.	0.6926705581282205
Major indications for laparoscopic enterostomy in patients with Crohn's disease are stenosis, fecal incontinence and complex anal fistulas in those with severe Crohn's proctitis.	0.46176873193221546
Most Crohn patients tolerate laparoscopic enterostomy and an increasing number demand this minimally invasive technique.	0.4146095215781616
The period of convalescence is much shorter and complications in connection with laparotomy are minimized.	0.5387369248901513
We report on a complete longitudinal rupture of the urethra in combination with a rupture of the pubic symphysis and pelvic fracture during spontaneous vaginal delivery.	0.6212539134184814
Only after stabilisation of the pelvic fracture by external skeletal fixation adaptation of the urethra was possible.	0.5956108455413468
Three weeks later after removing of the transurethral catheter a mild stress incontinence could be observed.	0.4116391678817606
In the follow up one year later the patient was completely continent.	0.9167884155389479
The cosmetic result was satisfactory.	0.3618779308768458
An unclear haematuria after delivery needs a meticulous urological examination.	0.2772492910465221
Early repair of urethral disruption minimize the risk of severe incontinence.	0.4095903174391822
Coordinated care between the trauma surgeon and urologist is required for successful treatment of this rare combined injury after birth.	0.544289176295513
The increased consumption of "ecstasy" (MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine) has also increased the number of life-threatening intoxications.	0.7333909493112104
From a Medline search of the years 1992-1996, reports were registered and evaluated.	0.5238370203249487
Besides cerebral, cardiorespiratory, renal, and hepatic symptoms, hyperthermia syndromes such as malignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, or the serotonin syndrome were common.	0.6202566686429435
In addition to a discussion of the intoxication symptoms and their acute and intensive-care therapy, the psychological and physiological effects of "ecstasy" will be described.	0.6466463128169263
Some historical considerations of the topic are included in this review.	0.5952551636940181
The goal of this prospective, randomised and double-blind pilot-study was to investigate the analgesic potency and the side-effects of tramadol enantiomers in clinical practice.	0.7213153524388403
One hundred patients recovering from orthopaedic surgery with a postoperative pain intensity of more than 50 on a visual analogue scale 0-100 mm (Table 1) were recruited for the study.	0.715224998317952
They were treated in a randomised, double-blind way with a maximal dose of 150 mg i.v.	0.5394580030993907
(+)-, (-)-tramadol, racemate, or 15 mg i.v.	0.8314950904954416
morphine or saline in the placebo group (5 groups, 20 patients each).	0.6757404684491158
The primary criterium of efficacy was the number of responders defined as patients with a pain reduction of at least 20 on VAS after 40 min.	0.5782976587945272
In case of pain, responders were allowed to continue with the double-blind drug up to six hours.	0.5389232501249985
The non-responders were treated with morphine as the rescue analgesic.	0.578984455297298
The secondary criterium was the incidence and severity of side-effects.	0.6004149733845373
Six patients terminated the study prematurely.	0.26373975842622677
One patient was excluded because of an allergic reaction to morphine, one patient could not be treated sufficiently with morphine, four were excluded because of protocol violations.	0.7739861816757426
There were 8 responders in the (+)-tramadol-, 6 in the (-)-tramadol- and 6 in the racemate group, 16* (P<0,05) in the morphine group, and 5 in the placebo group.	0.9242653689639349
Pain intensity after 40 min was reduced by 20 (p<0,05), 17 (p<0,05), 17 (p<0,05), 36 (p<0,01 vs placebo, p<0,05 vs (+)-, (-)-tramadol, and racemate group) and 5 mm on the VAS in the (+)-, (-)-, (+/-)-tramadol-, morphine- and placebo-group, respectively.	0.8857778836690349
Thirty eight adverse events like nausea, vomiting, PCO2-increase, and urinary retention occurred in 20 patients, most frequently in the (+)-tramadol- and morphine group.	0.7197480904420804
Sedation was significantly less profound in the (-)-tramadol group 1-4 h postoperatively.	0.8461880915762745
There were no side-effect in the tramadol racemate group.	0.6786369000764565
The enantiomers were equal to the racemate in analgesic potency, but inferior by far to morphine.	0.5764540055157282
They showed more adverse events and, hence, can not be preferred to the racemate in postoperative pain therapy.	0.6345298739657813
A 36-year-old man known as chronic alcohol abuser presently suffered from arthralgia and showed bilateral petriefied kidneys by sonography and computed tomography.	0.46162164077317047
Because of an unclear renal failure a kidney biopsy was performed and presented typical chronic renal oxalosis with massive oxalate crystal deposits, tubular atrophy and interstitital fibrosis.	0.5271739521662107
Since the man had never shown signs of hyperoxaluria in his life before, a secondary oxalosis was supposed.	0.478368501180061
The subsequently prompted exploration established a three to four times abuse of rocket fuel with cola lemonade 12 years before during the patient's army time as a marine soldier.	0.425727272696
Such fuels contain ethylene glycol (glysantin) as antifreeze commonly known to cause in toxic doses acute renal tubular necrosis with hyperoxaluria.	0.49024066739907457
The presented case, however, suggests a rare sublethal ethylene glycol poisoning with initial renal tubular damage, oxalate crystal deposition and subsequent chronic interstitial oxalate nephritis with tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis and chronic renal failure.	0.4840760587299515
Undergoing chronic hemodialysis, the patient died 5 months after the kidney biopsy diagnosis by acute heart failure.	0.7939113717645236
At autopsy, progressed chronic renal oxalosis could be confirmed.	0.42374250384073814
Decompensated oxalate cardiomyopathy with disseminated myocardial oxalate crystal deposits caused acute heart failure promoted by myocardial hypertrophy in renal hypertension.	0.36253959610898445
Insulinomas are rare tumors and account for 90 % of all endocrine pancreatic tumors.	0.7116823104833655
They typically present as a solitary tumor, but may occur in multiple sites (e.g.	0.6193557448681584
multiple endocrine neoplasia type I) or as a malignant disease in 10 % of cases and rarely as nesidioblastosis or islet cell adenomatosis.	0.7025743431679004
Neuroglucopenic symptoms lead to the diagnosis; inadequate high insulin and C-peptide secretion with hypoglycemia in the fasting test confirm the diagnosis.	0.4813284219812865
Preoperative localization is not necessary prior to the first operation.	0.6985654015731254
The standard operation is enucleation or, depending on size and location, resection.	0.5450550126064049
The treatment of multiple tumors and islet cell hyperplasia with a high risk of recurrence is problematic.	0.7284967185931926
Subtotal resection plus enucleation seems to be better than selective tumor resection.	0.4762817954525904
In malignant insulinomas, mostly presenting with liver metastases, aggressive surgical therapy with hepatectomy and debulking, chemoembolization and systemic chemotherapy are the modalities of choice.	0.518485543637652
MR spectroscopy is the only method for non-invasive detection of various aspects of cardiac metabolism in humans.	0.6614490913148524
While the 1H nucleus of water and fat molecules is the signal source for MR imaging, the MR spectroscopic technique allows for the study of a number of other nuclei, such as 13C, 19F, 23Na, 31P, 39K and 87Rb.	0.5175440446986651
Clinical applications presently are confined to the 31P nucleus.	0.32664027719913324
31P-MR spectroscopy allows the non-invasive study of cardiac high-energy phosphate metabolites ATP and phosphocreatine.	0.5012957419632066
The phosphocreatine/ATP ratio is considered an index of the energetic state of the heart.	0.5453639220680456
Possible clinical indications include heart failure, valve disease and coronary artery disease.	0.44496970500792904
In heart failure, the phosphocreatine/ATP ratio is reduced and correlates with clinical severity, ejection fraction and prognosis.	0.5382177024187843
In mitral and aortic valve disease, a reduced phosphocreatine/ATP ratio may indicate the optimum timing for valve replacement.	0.5513885801464896
In coronary artery disease, a regional decrease of phosphocreatine during stress ("biochemical ergometry") may indicate local ischemia.	0.6669155102114213
Furthermore, absolute quantification of high-energy phosphates may allow diagnosis of myocardial viability.	0.5930665313847254
Major technical developments, leading to improved spatial and temporal resolution will be necessary to establish MR spectroscopy as a routine clinical tool.	0.5767964389158255
A retrospective and partly prospective study was conducted to analyse both clinically and cephalometrically the craniofacial growth pattern of patients with isolated and syndrome-related premature craniosynostosis after standardized fronto-orbital and midface advancement.	0.5150097732877168
The file data of 293 children with fronto-orbital advancement were evaluated over an average period of 4.4 years.	0.6239118227520037
In addition, lateral teleradiographies of 117 patients from this group were cephalometrically analysed.	0.41446915490439756
Moreover, late results of 36 children and  8 adults with midface-advancement with an average follow-up period of 4.5 years were assessed.	0.7973361660582566
In contrast to linear craniectomy and so-called lateral canthal advancement, in only 8.2% of cases (24 out of 293 patients) were relapses requiring reoperation found in this study after fronto-orbital advancement.	0.7991406842663548
The evaluations indicate that with simple forms of craniosynostosis such as trigonocephaly and plagiocephaly predominantly very good or good growth can be observed.	0.4059235259108396
Cephalometric evaluation confirmed the limited potential of growth in the area of the anterior skull base and in the midface in the presence of syndrome-related faciocraniosynostoses.	0.6501497467501937
In such cases the cephalometrically confirmed maxillary hypoplasia, which increases in severity in the following order of syndromes `Saethre-Chotzen-Crouzon-Apert-Pfeiffer', could be influenced only to a limited degree by fronto-orbital advancement.	0.5612743308637748
For this reason midface advancement is of secondary importance in children with very severe anomalies.	0.636676113036372
In the present evaluation, a high rate of relapse of midfacial hypoplasia was to be found in children and adolescents after this operation in accordance with other references.	0.81265053970583
Therefore, the indication for Le Fort III osteotomy in the growth period should be limited.	0.6164893207059606
The introduction of Perfluorochemicals into medicine and especially into the treatment of severe lung injury is a fascinating scientific task.	0.5823827459568377
Many recall the famous experiments from Clark et al.	0.2418627738680445
in 1966 when he demonstrated "liquidventilation with perfluorocarbons" in the mammal species for the first time.	0.5140503222438619
After this hallmark, perfluorocarbons were subsequently introduced in research of acute lung injury by the techniques of Total- and Partial-Liquid-Ventilation (TLV; PLV).	0.49938963603387876
Perfluorocarbons (saturated organofluorids) have unique chemical and physical properties which made them attractive substances for intraalveolar application.	0.41332609746452836
The strong C-F bindings in the perfluorocarbon molecules are responsible for their chemical stability, biochemical inertness, high capacity to dissolve respiratory gases, low surface tension and high vapor pressures.	0.5160699718580938
Furthermore, the high density of the PFC lead to radio-opacity and their distribution to dependent lung areas.	0.5372870283649381
The efficacy of PFC liquid, applied by TLV/PLV has been demonstrated in numerous animal studies using different models of acute lung injury.	0.5176851155644924
Currently, several mechanisms of action of perfluorocarbon fluids in acute lung injury are discussed: recruitment of atelectatic alveoli, prevention of endexpiratory collapse of alveoli ("liquid PEEP"), redistribution of perfusion, oxygen transport, surfactant like effects and decrease of inflammation.	0.5855853574615755
Since total liquid ventilation has been used only in experimental models of lung injury, partial liquid ventilation has been introduced successfully into clinical trials (phase I-II).	0.616337485611855
However, the results of the first randomised, controlled study of PLV in 90 adult patients suffering from severe respiratory failure (ALI/ARDS) showed no differences between PLV and conventional treatment.	0.821260649789737
Furthermore, the instillation of relatively large amounts of liquid into the lungs poses several technical challenges and may be associated with complications such as liquithoraces, pneumothoraces and hypoxia.	0.48071845731978297
Since mammal lungs are evolutionary specialised to gas exchange using atmospheric oxygen, the application of liquids, even if they transport respiratory gases very well is not physiologic.	0.5056535746337565
To overcome these unwanted side effects, we developed a technique of perfluorocarbon vaporisation in analogy to the application of inhalation anaesthetic agents.	0.5125471613261654
After resolving some technical issues, this application technique was used successfully in an animal model of acute lung injury.	0.5703488824776444
Vaporisation of perfluorohexane in a concentration of 18 Vol.% of inspired gas improved significantly oxygenation and lung compliance.	0.5033399182836508
Though these results are promising, mechanisms of action, dose-efficacy relation, surfactant-perfluorocarbon interaction or anti-inflammatory effects of vaporised perfluorohexane are still unclear.	0.5649635499121848
These questions need to be clarified before this technique can be applied clinically.	0.5725007080785981
However, the inhalation of vapor, a technique already familiar to anaesthesiologists should avoid risks of large amounts of fluids in the bronchoalveolar space.	0.5374184911927296
Furthermore, this technique can be administered by established anaesthetic equipment with the advantage of exact dosing, continuous monitoring, and demand application in a way near to clinical routine.	0.6512845697761168
VDD pacing using a single pass lead for complete heart block is well described in adults but there are few reports of its use in children.	0.515104975034991
We have used 6 different standard adult size single pass leads and 5 different pacemaker generators in 21 children and adolescents aged 3.7-17.2 years (mean 9.9 years) and weighing 13.5 to 76 kg (mean 34.3 kg).	0.7727773199816523
Congenital complete heart block was present in 14 patients (with associated heart disease in 2 of them), surgical complete heart block in 6 patients and 2:1 AV block of uncertain cause in 1 patient.	0.7322222723496249
In 10 patients, the VDD system was their first pacing system.	0.6315765880489256
In 11 of the patients, 1-6 previous systems had been used and simultaneous extraction of ventricular leads (10) and/or atrial leads (5) was performed.	0.8578699410134146
All leads were introduced via a subclavian vein puncture (using the extraction sheath when present) and the atrial dipole was placed low in the right atrium to provide slack for further growth while maintaining atrial sensing.	0.6069077197907174
Ventricular thresholds ranged from 0.2 to 0.8 V. The minimal atrial amplitude was 0.7 to 4 mV and the maximum amplitude was 2.5 to 8 mV.	0.865316845462426
There was one early micro-displacement and the lead was repositioned.	0.43030756341208043
Over a follow-up period of 2-64 months (mean 32 months), all but 1 of the patients have maintained low ventricular pacing thresholds and adequate atrial signals for reliable pacing at rest and with exercise.	0.7865996552290195
During this time some have undergone considerable growth.	0.4060452566468706
In 1 patient, atrial sensing was lost after cardiopulmonary bypass for additional cardiac surgery at 24 months and the pacemaker was programmed into VVIR mode.	0.5542592513256183
One patient with coexisting congenital heart disease died suddenly at 3 years but the pacing system had no fault at autopsy.	0.45967825951306646
The standard adult size single pass lead provides a simple means to enable reliable atrial synchronous ventricular pacing in growing children with complete heart block.	0.43348330408447144
Open reduction with internal stabilization is considered to be the standard therapy for the treatment of displaced acetabular fractures.	0.7142238417080197
The internal fixation is routinely achieved by the use of plates and screws.	0.6116426219527258
The use of cerclage wires and cables as a reduction aid and definitive implant for stabilization has only occasionally been reported in the literature.	0.47226544533300924
The indication was mostly limited to use in elderly patients with insufficient bone stock.	0.5871504348144356
A newly instrument developed on the basis of a standard bone elevator is presented.	0.45226741748588106
It allows a safe, semiclosed application of a cerclage wire around the greater ischiatic notch through use of the second window of the ilioinguinal approach.	0.5462915446127903
A wide dissection at the "outside" of the pelvis is not necessary.	0.6686432721089952
A 35 year old patient developed swellings in the red colored areas of his tattoo.	0.5398989347753348
Histological examination revealed a lichenoid, pseudolymphomatous infiltrative pattern, that could be distinguished from frank lymphoma by means of electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry and molecular biology.	0.6122598203086633
The presence of dermal dendritic cells suggests a dermal-allergic pathogenesis of non-granulomatous tattoo reactions.	0.371283635096549
Therapy of choice is an excision of the inflamed areas.	0.6887495020254784
Interventional duct occlusion is increasingly performed with detachable coils.	0.310585331882569
In a series of 33 patients (34 procedures), we consistently used Gianturco-coils which were the initially employed coils.	0.604095480047657
They are not securable but can be implanted in a simple manner.	0.694747355540559
The rate of embolization was high (28 %) in the first 14 procedures; however, it declined to 5 % in the last 20 patients.	0.9023743550374664
We modified the technique by partially blocking the duct, when necessary, with a catheter which was advanced from the pulmonary artery and by implanting up to three coils.	0.6811953053894353
There was only one embolization and one small residual shunt in the last 20 patients.	0.5735244767015988
The mean fluoroscopy time in these patients was 11.0  +/-  5.8 minutes and decreased to 7.0  +/-  3.2 minutes in the last 10 patients with successful closure.	0.8785941424291375
Considering our experience, we continue to recommend the use of Gianturco-coils especially in the small duct which can be closed quickliy at low cost.	0.5758461282132924
This review presents data supporting the involvement of the dopaminergic system in depressive illness.	0.5199933543624724
Neuroanatomical research, animal research and clinical studies have shown that a dysfunction of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system could be associated with depressive symptoms.	0.5906102719669863
Furthermore, the chronic administration of antidepressants in animals provokes a sensitisation and enhanced expression of dopaminergic receptors.	0.5127631586571654
Although the dopaminergic system has received little attention in biological research on depression in the last decades, current research on the dopaminergic system is about to change this situation.	0.6143294345632767
Athletes who need high endurance capacity often use training at moderately high altitude (1500-3000 m) to improve oxygen delivery and utilization because of a hypoxia-induced increase of the red blood cell volume and adaptations at the muscular level.	0.5599525865117287
As maximal heart rates decrease at high altitude and plasma lactate levels for a given workload change during prolonged exposure to high altitude, it can be difficult to control and adapt the intensity and duration of the work-outs.	0.6185718022394787
Furthermore, maximal performance capacity decreases and therefore training intensity at high altitude is usually reduced compared to training at sea level.	0.45497094326321713
To avoid these disadvantages at high altitude a concept of living at moderately high altitude and training at lower elevations, termed "live high - train low" evolved, opposing the conventional concept of "live high - train high".	0.5484022095128132
A third option using a hypobaric chamber ("live low - train low") is hardly used anymore for training athletes.	0.6601593361436054
Studies on the effects of conventional high-altitude training for the improvement of athletic performance often lack a rigorous controlled design and yield controversial results.	0.4496476606110062
Regarding the new concept of "live high - train low" there is only one controlled study on college athletes and it shows a minor advantage of this new approach compared to conventional high-altitude training.	0.6471380861889862
However, training concepts are especially important for elite competitive athletes, and controlled studies with such individuals are very difficult to perform.	0.6654016207792725
Therefore, it appears that today we cannot answer the question of whether altitude-specific physiologic factors or non-altitude-related benefits of training camps account for the success of individual athletes.	0.6656745108130782
Purpose: To answer the following questions: whether reliable detection of lesions is possible in low-field-MRI-system (Magnetom Open 0.2 T) equipped with currently available hard- and software components in comparison to high field system (Magnetom Impact 1.0 T).	0.6682667476357166
Furthermore, whether localization of lesions suspect in MR-mammography can be realized in MR system of low field (Magnetom Open 0.2 T).	0.6081322780013717
Patients and Methods: In 11 patients, suspect lesions were diagnosed in diagnostic MR-mammography acquired with high field system (Magnetom Impact 1.0 T) and were compared to low field MR-mammographies of 0.2 T (Magnetom Open 0.2 T).	0.6950486045655171
In six of the 11 patients a suspect lesion was localized using wire marking.	0.47227685745125403
Results: All lesions considered suspect in diagnostic MR-mammography (Magnetom Impact 1.0 T) were also clearly identified in the 0.2 T system (Magnetom Open).	0.6901393544698335
In six cases wire marking was performed without any complications and with an accuracy of K 0.5 cm distance to the lesion.	0.6439227914904664
Conclusion: Although studies in the 0.2 T system clearly showed inferior SNR (34.6 vs. 83.1) and CNR (14.6 vs. 43.5) compared to studies with the high field system, all lesions considered suspect in diagnostic MR-mammography were reliably identified also in 0.2 T studies.	0.7280856806371612
Due to its open construction permitting permanent access to the breast and due to sufficient image quality, the Magnetom Open is suitable for interventions on the breast.	0.5751153607647826
Children with limb deficiencies or amputations of the lower extremities should be enabled to stand or to walk according to their state of development, because just standing and walking are among the most important preconditions for the best possible integration.	0.6471802455617788
Supply them with a prosthesis, orthesis and orthoprosthesis is therefore indispensable for rehabilitation.	0.4194335393792634
While a prosthesis replaces parts of the extremities, orthesis stabilizes the existing extremity.	0.48848351984993543
Orthoprostheses compensate longitudinal malformations, have a supporting effect, allow growth to be controlled and compensate for shortening.	0.578944650084093
Just as important as the remedy is early medical treatment.	0.3396018678399573
The sooner the treatment starts, the better the results.	0.48152406770990397

HIV remains infectious at room temperature for about six to twelve hours under sterile conditions, the time is shorter in the presence of bacteria and when clotting occurs.	0.5448995897819736
HIV infectivity is easily destroyed by disinfectants.	0.22198492423664343
The human infectious dose of HIV is around 100 to 1000 particles, dependent on the virus and the site of entry into the host.	0.46502811023734403
After inoculation new HIV is produced after 24 hours, and HIV has spread over the whole organism by the end of one or two weeks.	0.6990047804595091
HIV infection may be detected after four to twelve weeks by antibody assays, and after eleven days by nucleic acid based assays.	0.6016628477678471
Anti-HIV production might be slowed down under initial therapy.	0.25650388673125885
In addition to psychiatric outpatient treatment, the detoxification of alcoholics in psychiatric hospitals is an important link between medical detoxification and psychosocial inpatient treatment aiming at abstinence.	0.5762871725106706
Integrated models of inpatient detoxification and motivation therapy focus on improvement of the motivation of patients towards further treatment of their alcoholism and towards abstinence.	0.49294138838455315
In our study 529 alcoholics underwent such treatment lasting between 2 to 3 weeks.	0.5134093596532161
A total of 469 patients (89%) were followed up after 8  months; 242 alcoholics (52% of the follow-up sample; 46% of the whole sample) achieved the treatment goal and started further treatment, mainly as inpatients.	0.7371826951127292
Fifty-four of these patients relapsed before they started further alcoholism treatment, but achieved abstinence afterwards; 60 (25%) of these 242 patients relapsed after the specific alcoholism therapy; 227 alcoholics did not start further treatment after the initial detoxification and motivation therapy.	0.6516627739693645
In this subpopulation, 113 (50%) relapsed during the follow-up period.	0.5495335352860437
Although this is not a controlled study, it can be concluded that integrated inpatient detoxification and motivation therapy has positive effects on the treatment behavior of alcoholic patients and enhances the probability of further abstinence.	0.6799047905918986
In this article we report a very rare case of simultaneous and bilateral rupture of the quadriceps tendon in a 38-year-old patient.	0.7170757589039203
The initial diagnosis was "herniated vertebral disk".	0.4824163969161987
Although there was an extensive neurological and psychiatric examination in combination with several operations, it took almost 3 months until the real reason was found.	0.6353168346694316
In this case report we describe our postoperative treatment of early mobilization and compare it with other therapies.	0.6556974332615461
Neuroendocrine tumors of the thymus, also known as thymic carcinoids, are rare tumors of the anterior mediastinum.	0.8354897139446991
They occur sporadically or in association with the MEN I syndrome.	0.39206999920018276
We present five patients (four male, one female; age of first manifestation 19-53 years) who were operated on at our hospital between 1984 and 1995 for neuroendocrine thymic tumors.	0.6982662218045552
A hormone-producing tumor presented with Cushing's syndrome in two patients.	0.44040840960101146
Two patients had MEN I syndrome.	0.38746263336174785
Only in the female patient the primary tumor was confined to the thymus.	0.7410595191750369
We found lymph node metastases in three patients and a distant metastasis in one.	0.6571295858620855
The neuroendocrine tumors have a high rate of local recurrences and thus we performed 11 operations using a transthoracic or transsternal approach.	0.5182301955887562
Since there was no operative mortality and adjuvant therapies are of limited value, we recommend surgery even in case of recurrence.	0.6740131866786854
Korsakoff's psychosis (Wernicke-Korsakoff-Syndrome) following severe, long-term  alcoholism is considered to be widely resistent to treatment.	0.4786508410403105
We report two cases with beneficial effects of treatment by a combination of clonidine and fluvoxamine.	0.5943651501039495
The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia was based on the neuroleptical blockade of central dopamine D2 receptors.	0.45218097222432985
Brain imaging studies, however, generally failed to demonstrate a significant increase in central D2 receptors among schizophrenic patients.	0.508100958991542
Using a novel approach, the group of Laruelle and Abi-Dargham was now able to demonstrate that schizophrenic patients have increased synaptic dopamine concentrations in the striatum.	0.5900617537701649
Endogenous dopamine competes with a radioligand for binding at dopamine D2 receptors; compared to healthy control subjects, blockade of dopamine production in neuroleptic-naive schizophrenic patients induced a significantly higher increase in D2 binding of the infused radioligand, indicating higher endogenous synaptic dopamine.	0.4451540723210191
A similar increase in D2 binding was also observed in drug-free schizophrenics who had previously been treated with neuroleptics; these patients also showed an increased density of striatal D2 receptors, most likely due to counteradaptive upregulation of D2 receptors during neuroleptic medication.	0.585130992225337
The Columbia study provides an important indication of hyperdopaminergic function in schizophrenia.	0.41468569432432767
Multiple and bilateral oncocytomas are rare.	0.2691664285303096
There are only ten cases that have been previously described.	0.5933706739094274
Three of these displayed multiple and bilateral oncocytomas and microoncocytomas, a so-called oncocytomatosis.	0.5240988536838397
This report describes a case of renal oncocytomatosis found at autopsy.	0.5543730864789368
In addition, we found an adrenal adenoma, a pheochromocytoma and thoracic cicatrices 4 years after curatively resected large cell carcinoma of the lung.	0.7502054004887656
In the distal renal tubules we found oncocytic epithelial cells, with partial transition into microoncocytomas.	0.5593900299588117
Immunhistochemically, these and the main oncocytomas were CD 10 negative.	0.5277839852106889
These findings support the origin of oncocytoma from oncocytically transformed distal tubular epithelium.	0.3580617470933579

Malignant bone tumors require the same careful staging as, for example, lung cancer.	0.6216789697055111
However, well-established staging systems for non-osseous tumors are not suitable for bone tumors.	0.6251283129541123
Therefore we present Enneking's staging system for malign bone tumors here, which is better adapted to the special problems of these entities because it integrates clinical, radiological and histological findings.	0.6321120802825894
The weak points of Enneking's staging system (e.g.	0.24927548077648545
inflexibility, changes in radiological modalities in the past 20 years) are discussed.	0.7650472883223627
Efficient analgesia may be the major objective in the cardiovascular risk patient following myocardial infarction, acute occlusion of peripheral vessels, or dissection/perforation of major abdominal vessels.	0.6161819062134491
It was the purpose of the study to investigate the haemodynamic and respiratory side effects of eight different opioids in 57 circulatory risk patients prior to major vascular surgery.	0.8172523020676328
Patients were randomly allocated to eight groups, each receiving a different opioid within a clinical, equipotent dose range (buprenorphine, fentanyl, morphine, nalbuphine, pentazocine, pethidine, tramadol, alfentanil).	0.4779816412542791
A complete haemodynamic and blood gas status was obtained prior to as well as 5, 10, 15, and 20 min following opioid administration.	0.7029087336902109
Monitoring included a complete invasive haemodynamic and blood gas status.	0.34091933767403987
Statistical evaluation was performed by 1- and 2-factorial ANOVA (P<0.05).	0.7308526808385988
Significant time effects (changes from baseline at the time of measurement) were observed for heart rate and total peripheral resistance, while significant group (group-specific differences in the course of values at the different times of measurements) and time effects were noted for mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, stroke volume index, and PaO2.	0.776380759332812
No major effects were observed following morphine, fentanyl, alfentanil, tramadol, and nalbuphine.	0.532599151702397
Buprenorphine caused distinct respiratory depression accompanied by an increase in pulmonary vascular tone.	0.4598606869194288
Pentazocine and pethidine caused a significant increase in MPAP and peripheral vascular resistance while pethidine also produced marked respiratory depression.	0.3754327230856435
For interpretation of the results, factors such as respiratory depression, histamine release, secretion of endogenous catecholamines, and hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction have to be discussed.	0.6147035980009312
Tramadol, an opioid with moderate potency, seems to offer some advantages due to its minor cardiovascular and respiratory side effects.	0.5969407992174564
In this article we report a case of an early postoperative compartment syndrome of the anterior tibial compartment with complete sensomotoric palsy of the peroneal nerve after arthroscopic-assisted replacement of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) of the knee.	0.7349858635089715
The tourniquet pressure was 360 mm Hg and operation time was 1.75 h. After the operation the leg was bandaged to avoid swelling of the leg and as antithrombotic prophylaxis.	0.6567350228593546
Analgesic therapy was by continuous epidural bupivacaine infusion.	0.330678180444345
Increasing pain of the lower leg was suppressed by additional analgesia.	0.6927038259104082
Due to persistent pain despite regular analgesia, the patient was sent to a main hospital on the 3rd postoperative day, where an extremely painful and swollen anterior tibial compartment with intracompartimental pressure of over 100 mm Hg was found.	0.6365878649795036
The compartment was released immediately.	0.23843562346896482
Despite the appearance of severe muscle damage, no extensive débridement was done.	0.5829501194271403
At the second examination, at 48 h, there was minimal perfusion of the muscles without contraction and islands of ischemic necrosis.	0.6801500395251112
Clinically, there was complete palsy of the dorsiflexors of the foot.	0.6474783950859575
The case shows the danger of a compartment syndrome when tourniquet of the limb, arthroscopy and a firm bandage are combined.	0.48111591242844215

The influence of biomechanics in surgery of the locomotor apparatus has been constantly increasing over the last few decades.	0.5466436234115641
The purpose of this study was to determine wether biomechanical studies can significantly influence therapy and treatment of shoulder injuries, especially shoulder instability.	0.7275190318453828
The investigation was performed on 23 fresh human specimens with intact capsular ligaments of the glenohumeral joint.	0.4561442622043961
A Bankart lesion from 3 o'clock to 6 o'clock was repaired, and a Bankart repair and anterior inferior capsular shift, as described by Neer, were performed.	0.7103693424327183
The measurement was done on six clinically relevant positions of instability: superior, anterior, anterior-inferior, inferior, posterior-inferior, posterior.	0.5465840509034279
Measurement was done using a specially developed strain-gauge system.	0.389645290088036
It was demonstrated that both instability and too much stability of the shoulder joint lead to a significant change in shoulder biomechanics.	0.6323115870258131
The anatomical 0-position of the glenohumeral joint in 110  ° of abduction is a position of about 60  ° of external rotation compared to the 0-position for clinical measurement.	0.6740051809372376
From the therapy point of view, one has to ask for anatomical reconstruction instead of tight repair in soft-tissue repair in the glenohumeral joint.	0.5094594333653574

A case of atrial ectopic tachycardia in an infant probably caused by a small tumor in the interatrial septum is presented.	0.5506011707302086
The arrhythmia was successfully treated with amiodarone.	0.40454405458595494
Several histologic abnormalities are known to cause AET, but an intracardiac tumor detectable by two-dimensional echocardiography is extremely rare.	0.6118588086236242
AET - especially in childhood - as well as cardiac tumors show a tendency to regression, so that even in this case medical treatment should be the first therapeutic choice.	0.8734752549133792
Interventional or surgical treatment is required just for those patients with AET that is resistant to medical treatment or reoccurs after finishing the medical treatment.	0.6066667825364637
Tonsure trichotillomania is a subtype of trichotillomania in which the scalp exhibits a tonsural pattern of alopecia over the crown, extending to the frontal margin and sparing the lateral margins and the nape of the neck.	0.5000370360362437
It differs from to the more common form of childhood trichotillomania in that predominantly female adolescents are affected and its incidence is related to quite severely pathologic psychodynamics, often with a disturbed relationship to female sexuality.	0.48334431611112305
The treating physician should be more guarded in assessing the prognosis; hair plucking often continues for years.	0.4123882676978547
Two patients with tonsure alopecia, associated in one case with trichotillomania of the pubic hair and in the other with enuresis, are presented.	0.8105822519313463
The aim of the following study was to develop an osteoporotic model by means of ovariectomy.	0.8805873194336701
Bone mineral density of the upper and lower jaw was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DPX) before and after ovariectomy.	0.568361147466029
Histomorphometric measurements were done by a microtomography system.	0.4660563687623294
Bone mineral density decreased significantly after ovariectomy in the upper and lower jaw.	0.5580040875117069
There is evidence for the community effectiveness of preventive geriatric intervention programs prior to the need for help or long-term care from a couple of prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs).	0.6240181256370224
For geriatric rehabilitation programs tailored to older people with imminent or manifest need for long-term care analogous - evidence is still lacking.	0.5484289525723012
The nation-wide leading boards of the FRG's Sickness Insurance Administration in conjunction with its Central Medical Service have formulated guidelines for the formation of a nation-wide ambulatory geriatric rehabilitation service to realize the postulate of the long-term care insurance legislation "rehabilitation prior to long-term care".	0.5596567160185894
These guidelines must be proven empirically.	0.23629231323704797
To prove the effectiveness and efficiency of the foreseen ambulatory geriatric rehabilitation service, the RCT design would be highly desirable.	0.5937099068415413
Unfortunately, the prerequisites in the field of methodology are poor since valid, reproducible and feasible criteria for the selection of suitable patients and measurement criteria which meet the requirement of proven medium-term sensitivity to change do not yet exist.	0.5591542616225764
Nevertheless, there is a great and urgent need, for the first time, to investigate the cost-effectiveness ratio for this ambulatory geriatric rehabilitation service to be established in the FRG, leaving aside the methodologic desiderata of randomized control-groups.	0.7740487118926027
"Idiopathic" ventricular tachycardia is an exclusion diagnosis.	0.34214104534119066
The underlying reasons and mechanisms of "idiopathic" ventricular tachycardias are still not completely understood.	0.591075217395642
Recent investigations showed a high prevalence of morphological abnormalities in the right ventricle of patients with "idiopathic" ventricular tachycardia out of the right ventricular outflow tract, which could often be correlated with the origin of the ventricular tachycardia.	0.8708722002319729
These described abnormalities were not uniform.	0.2592061265749027
Here we report about a patient suffering from drug-refractory "idiopathic" ventricular tachycardia for 10 years.	0.49911243068709366
This is the first report in which the origin of an "idiopathic" ventricular tachycardia could be localized by right-ventricular angiography, magnetic resonance tomography and electrophysiological study in the area of an interventricular septal thickening of the right ventricular outflow tract and cured by radiofrequency catheter ablation.	0.6507303063919486
Fetal teratomas are extra- or intracorporal congenital malformations with different localization.	0.5584322720532401
Although they are rare, they may provoke severe obstetrical complications if they are not prenatally diagnosed.	0.6656142887659466
If sonographic examination of fetal teratomas is performed, it is necessary to evaluate the further development of pregnancy for fetal outcome and pregnancy aspects in relationship to the localization, size and ultrasound criteria of the tumor.	0.6552085992744823
Sonographic findings reveal the criteria and conditions for conservative or invasive management or reasons for continuing or terminating the pregnancy.	0.38978123252151003
Prenatal ultrasound examination is the only possibility to reduce perinatal morbidity and mortality, as exemplified by 8 prenatally examined fetal teratomas.	0.6658861227912719
We report on a 62-year-old female patient with melena in which polypoid lesions of the cecum were discovered endoscopically.	0.5854789743688332
Histological examination of mucosal biopsies revealed an inflammatory process with lots of histiocytes and so-called Michaelis-Gutmann bodies, leading to the diagnosis of a malakoplakia of the colon.	0.5664298471211925
No other organs were found affected.	0.335261575157262
In the course of an antibiotic therapy, there was no melena detectable over a period of six months.	0.6387354709972829
Malakoplakia, an inflammation usually affecting the urogenital tract, is rarely found in the colon, with only 35 cases published until now.	0.7597230776373339
It is frequently associated with other diseases like neoplastic or inflammatory disorders, immune defect syndromes or heroin abuse.	0.4077356278103968
This spectrum is expanded by our report in which a long-standing alcohol abuse was found as an attendant disease.	0.6296765334881157
Unilateral laterothoracic exanthem a (ULE) is a self-limited, probably infectious-allergic skin disease predominately affecting small children.	0.5770143823606712
We describe five such cases.	0.2060054608823048
The typical unilaterally located or at least unilaterally dominant exanthem usually starts in the axillary region and is characterized by red, partly confluent papules and fine scales.	0.48381182198390477
Two of the children presented with atypical manifestations of ULE.	0.5922139535720716
Due to its asymptomatic course, therapy is not necessary in the majority of cases.	0.9511135082352846
Minimally invasive adrenalectomy is now an accepted alternative to conventional adrenalectomy.	0.4808511770908817
As in open surgery, several different endoscopic approaches to the adrenal glands have been described.	0.5902296551122059
In principle, one must distinguish between the laparoscopic and the retroperitoneoscopic access.	0.5208184965544713
All adrenal tumors - pheochromocytomas included - except adrenal carcinomas can be removed endoscopically.	0.5076572156048099
However, the use of these techniques is limited in patients with particularly large tumors.	0.7821286356825665
The results reported to date are convincing.	0.43300672103719184
Only limited data are available as yet to compare conventional and endoscopic adrenalectomy.	0.48957516066234963
Because adrenal diseases requiring surgery are rare, endoscopic adrenalectomy is an operation that, for the present, will be limited to centers with a particular interest in laparoscopic and endocrine surgery.	0.6856372773589338
Economic evaluations have become more and more important in the somatotherapeutic field.	0.5231756053277755
This survey's objective was to examine if the current economic evaluation techniques can be applied to psychotherapy.	0.609509234624452
8 data banks, 17 key words from the psychotherapeutic field and 14 economic key words were used, the identified original studies were classified in accordance with Drummond, the methodical quality of each study was assessed at a score between 0 and 10 points.	0.5729584823475434
21 studies were found: 16 cost- benefit analyses, 4 cost-effectiveness analyses and one cost-utility analysis.	0.5826333992462192
The quality of the representation of the clinical results (mean value 8.6) was better than that of the economic results (mean value 6.1).	1.0199453414633384
It was perfectly possible to evaluate psychotherapeutic interventions with regard to economic aspects by means of the current techniques but in most cases there was a considerable lack of quality in both representation and calculation.	0.6441407313677294
Furthermore the evaluation type of cost-utility analysis, which is the only one that takes quality of life aspects into consideration and therewith seems to be the most appropriate approach regarding the psychotherapeutic field, has been greatly ignored.	0.7783911708263536
As a net effect of ACE-inhibitors and AT1-receptor antagonists on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) cardioprotection due to vasodilative (reduction of blood pressure, afterload reduction), antiproliferative (reduced cell growth, reduction of "vascular" andor "ventricular remodeling", reduced formation of extracellular matrix), as well as antiadrenergic actions and due to the stimulating effect on natriuresis, reduction of blood pressure, preload reduction can be expected.	0.5447852735759211
These aims of therapy have mostly been confirmed for the action of ACE-inhibitors by experimental and clinical studies but except for the treatment of arterial hypertension and few preliminary reports concerning the treatment of cardiac dysfunction, no comparable data are available for AT1-receptor antagonists.	0.6961155657270638
To date, an antithrombotic and profibrinolytic action could only be demonstrated for ACE-inhibitors.	0.5331787309334702
This effect has been discussed to be responsible for the improvement of long-term prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease.	0.7257941845440463
Despite the similar spectrum of action there exist important differences between ACE-inhibitors and AT1-receptor antagonists that might underline the need of an individual use of these drugs: the dual action of ACE-inhibitors on the RAS and the kinin system bears many benefits but has been also shown to be accompanied by side-effects, mainly chronic dry cough, in a relatively high percentage of patients thus leading to discontinuation of therapy in 8-14%.	0.6716557232965186
This respective side-effect can be prevented by the use of AT1-receptor antagonists.	0.5493088240164068
It has been discussed whether the incomplete action of ACE-inhibitors on AT1-receptor-mediated effects is at least in part responsible for the efficacy of this drug which is relatively high (75-80%) as compared to other substances.	0.8043586413103399
Due to their direct action, AT1-receptor-blockers might also be of high effectiveness for the treatment of severe heart failure.	0.6369871118203707
A combination of the ACE-inhibitor-mediated activation of the kinin-system with the more specific blockade of AT1-receptors by AT1-receptor antagonists might be of benefit and is currently under investigation.	0.5997706803452606
Finally, it has been discussed that the incresed AT II concentration in case of AT1-receptor-blockade activates AT2-receptor-mediated mechanisms thus leading to an additive vasoprotective effect.	0.6831016912493831
An isomorphic response is defined as a nonspecific skin stimulus eliciting a disease-specific skin reaction.	0.46508663677480006
We report on the development of the Koebner phenomenon in a 32 year old patient with psoriasis after skin testing with UVB at a dose above 0,055 J/cm2.	0.6586213662723797
In addition we describe a 28 years old patient who developed new psoriatic plaques in the areas affected by the virus after a varicella infection.	0.6360686526906635
The presence of nicotine in sweat obtained from smokers and one non-smoker exposed to tobacco smoke after 4 h to 8 days of nicotine-free time was investigated.	0.41037357602337665
Following stimulation of the eccrine glands, sweat samples were taken every hour for 6 h.The total nicotine concentrations, i.e.	0.47700749847072244
the sum of nicotine and its metabolites, were determined by radioimmunoassay.	0.6552415480967083
The presence of unchanged nicotine was revealed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.	0.36840694803923213
Up to now there is no specific treatment targeting the ultimate cause of interstitial cystitis (IC), since its pathogenesis and etiology are still unknown.	0.6212464298834379
Most studies focussing on oral medication have not been randomized, double-blinded or placebo-controlled.	0.5387412982810266
Numerous case reports and intent-to-treat trials are lacking a systematic approach and do not meet evidence-based medicine criteria.	0.538531083411908
Consequently there is as yet no standard oral therapy available for the treatment of IC.	0.4613454190129379
Differential radiomodification induced by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) is proving to be a feasible modality for optimizing tumor radiotherapy.	0.8111606537905164
Our earlier work on Ehrlich ascites tumor cells has shown that pretreatment with hematoporphyrin derivatives increases the uptake and phosphorylation of 2-DG.	0.4573445317564677
Moreover, the alteration induced in bioenergetic profile was more drastic and less reversible.	0.466630642653025
The promising combination of hematoporphyrin derivatives and 2-DG has been further evaluated in the Ehrlich ascites tumor bearing mice for determining the effects on radiotherapeutic response.	0.5499219764693115
Solid tumors (average volume = 0.9 +/- 0.1 cm3) implanted in Swiss-albino strain "A" mice were focally irradiated (10 Gy) using 60Co teletherapy.	0.6975463111998925
Tumor bioenergetics was assessed by 31P MR spectroscopy.	0.3670090643291278
The uptake and phosphorylation of 2-DG was observed to be increased following pretreatment with hematoporphyrin derivatives.	0.5844467256837489
Upon hematoporphyrin derivatives + 2-DG treatment followed by irridiation, the intracellular pH reduced and a remarkable increase in glycerophosphorylcholine and inorganic phosphate levels was observed.	0.48307173542969484
The present study demonstrates the potential of hematoporphyrin derivative pretreatment in increasing the bioavailability of 2-DG in a mice Ehrlich ascites tumor model.	0.5881116804745518
The finding may have interesting clinical implications in the form of increased manifestation of the radiation-induced damage in the case of use of these drugs as a potential adjuvant in radiotherapy of tumors.	0.6394671127238304
The novel Lenz (1835) by the German author, social revolutionist and physician Georg Büchner (1813-1837) can be regarded as a prominent document in the history of medicine.	0.575310345294221
On the one hand, Büchner's description of a schizophrenic disorder meets recent criteria; on the other, he hints at the physician's modern general attitude toward the patient.	0.6029678233089835
The latter is derived from his philosophy of art and political motives.	0.4279440524639898
The hypothesis is discussed that a dysfunction of the descending antinociceptive system may underly the pain of fibromyalgia.	0.4881850504546592
Data from animal experimentation show that an interruption of the system by spinal cord cooling leads to (1) increase in ongoing activity,  (2) lowering in stimulation threshold, and (3) increase in response magnitude in nociceptive dorsal horn neurons.	0.6682849620508104
The influence of the descending system was stronger on the responses to input from deep nociceptors than to input from cutaneous nociceptors.	0.506368590147186
If similar changes occur also in patients, an impairment of the tonicly active descending system should be followed by (1) spontaneous pain (ongoing activity), (2) tenderness (lowering in mechanical threshold), and (3) hyperalgesia (increased responses to noxious stimuli).	0.614880855953519
These changes should affect mainly deep pain, because the antinociceptive system influences predominantly input from deep nociceptors.	0.47216016702796465
Animal experiments with microbiologic examinations and studies in cell cultures have shown that ionomer cement is a biocompatible and biostable bone replacement material in the head and neck region.	0.43593627825500525
Clinical and functional results of its use in the human middle ear have proven to be satisfactory during a maximal period of 2.5 years observation.	0.79406370683023
The present trial was continued in order to determine the long-term behavior of ionomer cement (Ionos partial and total ossicles) after reconstruction of the ossicular chain.	0.5857771475664684
The ossicular chain was reconstructed in 343 cases and included various losses of one or more of the ossicles (i.e., incus, incus and malleus, incus and stapes superstructure, and malleus, incus and stapes superstructure).	0.5385646313925698
Follow-up extended over a maximum period of 5.5 years.	0.7715125879749036
Patients were examined under a surgical microscope and a pure-tone audiogram was performed at regular intervals.	0.6036639246610704
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is not presently performed in Germany.	0.6282166446355045
According to PGD's opponents there, existing laws for the protection of embryos forbid this type of diagnostics.	0.4173104170824849
Proponents feel that these laws do not stand in the way of PGD, depending on legal viewpoint.	0.43036673969792166
This controversy has hindered PGD's application in Germany.	0.24145486543105968
The nature of this longstanding, emotional discussion is not easy to describe to scientists abroad.	0.48887607103006264
This retrospective study investigated the stability of the small AO external fixator in a radioradial configuration used in the treatment of 42 mostly unstable distal radius fractures (types A-3.2, C-1.2 and C-2.1 according to the AO classification).	0.7782678378016026
No bone grafting was performed.	0.3306743255046277
All cases were documented with antero-posterior and lateral X-rays preoperatively, 0, 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively and after consolidation.	0.84520210276639
Early functional aftertreatment was started one week after surgery.	0.3937474585634658
Thirty-six fractures showed a dorsal comminution, combined with osteopenia in 18 cases.	0.6053094815754103
The mean preoperative radial angle of 17 ° was normalized to 25 ° postoperatively.	0.39282151614482436
The mean preoperative volar angle of minus 30 ° was reduced to 12 ° postoperatively.	0.4802592416136987
None of these mean angles changed until consolidation.	0.3712475026188764
The external fixator was removed on average after 7 weeks (range 6-10 weeks) depending on the radiological fracture healing.	0.6422012277673588
The small AO external fixator in a radioradial configuration proved to be stable enough for early functional aftertreatment of the wrist.	0.42080621282277275
Its stability is related to a proper operative technique and correct indication (unstable Colles type with one or two distal fragments).	0.5419308489457183
Bone grafting is unnecessary if the external fixator is left in situ until bony consolidation.	0.46529325891902845
Purpose: To develop and implement a method to obtain digital subtraction (DS) spiral computed tomography angiograms (SCTA) in order to avoid superimposition of bony structures and vascular calcifications on SCTA maximum intensity projections (MIPs) and shaded surface display (SSD).	0.5445034911214568
The concept of small-volume resuscitation, the rapid infusion of a small volume (4 ml/kg BW) of hyperosmolar 7.2-7.5% saline solution for the initial therapy of severe hypovolemia and shock was advocated more than a decade ago.	0.8801373516475155
Numerous publications have established that hyperosmolar saline solution can restore arterial blood pressure, cardiac index and oxygen delivery as well as organ perfusion to pre-shock values.	0.5173559587117768
Most prehospital studies failed to yield conclusive results with respect to a reduction in overall mortality.	0.43541743360076907
A meta-analysis of preclinical studies from North and South America, however, has indicated an increase in survival rate by 5.1% following small-volume resuscitation when compared to standard of care.	0.5921076267688717
Moreover, small-volume resuscitation appears to be of specific impact in patients suffering from head injuries with increased ICP and in severest trauma requiring immediate surgical intervention.	0.5654905944762474
The utility of electron beam computed tomography (EBT) to estimate cerebral blood volume (CBV) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) was evaluated.	0.666188844976437
Eleven patients with suspected acute cerebral ischemia were investigated.	0.5825038309586187
The EBT was performed with an acquisition time of 50 ms per slice at eight parallel levels.	0.4813908107830771
To compare signal/noise and contrast/ noise ratios the data from the EBT investigation were compared to a similar examination on a spiral CT.	0.5712735488456084
The signal/noise ratio with EBT was about 30%, the contrast/noise ratio 25% of that with spiral CT.	0.6746640683319148
The absolute values of CBV were 4.9 +/- 1.2 ml/100 g (EBT); CBF was 50.5 +/- 7.0 ml/100 g/min in normal contralateral brain tissue.	0.6272203399659532
In four patients with proven infarcts on follow-up, the ischemic areas had a CBV ranging from 1.7 to 3.8 ml/100 g, while CBF ranged from 9.4 to 24.5 ml/100 g/min.	0.8025294826627668
Using a bolus injection of contrast material, calculation of absolute CBV and CBF is feasible using EBT.	0.4202584153356537
Advantages of EBT are the absolute measurements possible and it's multislice capability.	0.43280796488317863
Disadvantages, however, are caused by the high image noise, limiting the demarcation of ischemic tissue.	0.5300922098233908
The report, in two parts, sums up the findings of a survey covering 52 cities in Central Europe.	0.704476727988757
Most administrations have imposed a ban on feeding street pigeons, but this has been more or less unsuccessful.	0.5464459408293594
Information campaigns were used on a large scale, along with more controversial methods such as catching the birds or shooting them down, providing pigeon houses, administering hormone preparations, chemosterilization, and exclusion from buildings.	0.4376589989254084
Few attempts were made to reduce the number of breeding places.	0.4527299378745968
Population reduction by poisons or natural enemies seems to be negligible.	0.3208446543348533
We report a rare case of an accident during which a pedestrian was hit by a car and was thrown through the windscreen into the front seat.	0.5452038264586425
Apart from the high speed (100 km/h or more) the traumatic amputation of both lower legs and the resulting reduced angular momentum mainly contributed to the final position of the pedestrian in the vehicle.	0.652502750158985
In addition, the low height of the person standing in front of the vehicle is deemed to have been a supporting factor for the course of the accident.	0.6822266021829126
A 41-year-old woman with severe juvenile diabetes mellitus suffered from profund hypothermia after loss of thermoregulation in diabetic ketoacidosis.	0.43234379981672744
She was found unconscious, without measurable blood pressure; the electrocardiogram (ECG) showed bradycardia of 30/min and the rectal temperature was 23.7  °C.	0.6768799775853743
The patient received mechanical ventilation, fluid therapy, warmed gastric lavage, and, unfortunately, inotropic medication.	0.6065479633001056
She was transferred to a department of cardiac surgery in order to continue the therapy with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).	0.5136254889722415
On arrival, the patient had a rectal temperature of 27.3  °C, the ECG showed an absolute arrhythmia with a frequency of 70/min, and the blood pressure was 63/43 mm Hg.	0.921731385693829
We decided to use a rapidly available but not highly invasive venovenous hemofiltration technique for slowly rewarming the patient.	0.38932027855838325

The hemofiltration system (Gambro AK-10, Gambro AB, Sweden) was instituted with a blood flow rate of 200 ml/min.	0.5681886065497289
The hemofiltration monitor controls the pumps for filtering and substituting fluid volumes and allows the infusion solutions to be heated up to 40  °C.	0.34711085173376655
Sinus rhythm resumed without antiarrhythmic medications at a temperature of 29.5  °C, and within 8 h the patient was rewarmed to 35.5  °C.	0.7871180893641232
After treatment of the adult respiratory distress syndrome caused by pneumonia, she was discharged from the intensive care unit to complete treatment with no evidence of any permanent organ damage.	0.7110515645556432
We conclude that hemofiltration may be the method of choice for rewarming deeply hypothermic patients when their circulation is preserved.	0.5392749527257409
Under these circumstances, it is preferable to external rewarming techniques, as it avoids the disadvantages of temperature afterdrop and rewarming shock.	0.6563252045596584
Rewarming rates of 1.5  °C/h seem to be adequate.	0.8551109990451276
Hemofiltration systems are more widespread, less invasive, and easier to handle compared to CPB techniques, which should be preferred in situations of prolonged unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation with cardiac arrest and deep core temperatures.	0.6629617626698098
We report an unusual injury of the face caused by the spoke of an automatic telescoping umbrella that come loose when the umbrella was opened.	0.5576082504816332

The original reason for using the German "Habilitation" degree to mean that a candidade had qualified and could conduct research and teach at a university is no longer really valid, as this is being threatened by its importance to further careers.	0.5269502527330014
Medical faculties must discuss how this development can be curtailed.	0.3378401391907035
In order to check the current situation, the Habilitation degree systems of 36 medical faculties of German universities were compared with the aid of a scoring system.	0.6270021777347068
Conformity existed only in the demand for a doctoral dissertation, scientific publications and a lecture on approval.	0.48086411315840555
Concerning other criteria for qualification there was decreasing consensus in the following order: Habilitation thesis, commitment to teaching, further professional education, participation in congresses, inaugural lecture, qualification to teach, scientific activity, broad background in the discipline, and introduction to the faculty.	0.5178882050177017
Application of the scoring system with a maximum of 33 score points resulted in a mean value of 15.2 points and a range from 6 to 29 points.	0.7023997523734995
A significant decrease in the score values occurred with increasing age of the Habilitation degree (P = 0.002).	0.6177268990465165
Even if scoring systems are ambiguous and unfair, our analysis revealed serious differences in the quality of the Habilitation degree.	0.5610054061343136
Presuming that the German Habilitation degree should be maintained as a high-level qualification, we developed proposals that might be used to standardize this academic examination.	0.6969314432286461
Chronic reduction in uteroplacental blood flow causes intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR).	0.32337752037762746
In an animal model fetal umbilical perfusion in experimentally induced IUGR was examined.	0.38463801406716813
Pregnant sheep were instrumented with externally adjustable occluders on the common internal iliac artery to regulate uterine blood flow in the last third of gestation.	0.5246383270638847
Flow probes on the uterine arteries and the common umbilical artery provided blood flow measurements.	0.4242009773700458
Uterine blood flow was restricted in the group destined to become growth retarded whereas uterine blood flow in the equally instrumented controls was allowed to rise normally.	0.5268391609575327
When the experiment was terminated and morphometric data were obtained, uterine blood flow in controls was significantly higher than in restricted animals.	0.5846184542677586
Body weight and ponderal index in fetuses of flow-restricted mothers was significantly lower than in controls.	0.517270841631295

Prognostic assessment of acute global cerebral anoxia following cardiorespiratory arrest requiresa high level of clinical and technical diagnostic skills.	0.46480985974393896
Statements regarding prognosis of this form of coma can be made only with reference toa large number of clinical, neurophysiological, biochemical, and cerebral imaging data.	0.5828930009817304
Previous research in this field has usually been restricted to only one or a few parameters such as clinical data, EEG findings, evoked potentials or biochemical markers.	0.5439461539054786
The present compilation of the various aspects regarding diagnosis and prognosis is intended to define the present state of the art in diagnosis and prognosis of anoxic coma, and also serve as a basis for a multicenter prospective study including all of the relevant data to improve diagnosis and arrive at guidelines for effective prognostication of anoxic coma.	0.7446355048299227
In 96 patients (ductal pancreatic carcinoma, n = 34; periampullary carcinoma, n = 43; chronic pancreatitis, n = 19) the role of CA 19-9 in the diagnosis of lesions of the head of the pancreas were evaluated.	0.6438226887478613
The sensitivity for ductal pancreatic carcinoma was 73.3 %, for periampullary carcinoma 48.8 %, and specificity was 63.2 %.	0.6784906529141573
Carcinoembryonic antigen was elevated only in every fifth patient.	0.3629932510912589
Even when combining the two tumor markers no increase in sensitivity could be observed.	0.3578378242713763
The low specificity of 63 %, which decreased to 33 % in the case of obstructive jaundice, does not allow adequate preoperative differentiation between cancer patients and those with chronic pancreatitis.	0.7263911746264976
In cases of postoperatively elevated CA 19-9 level the prognosis is worse than in patients with normal tumor markers.	0.5950916853903723

The basic principles of management can be described as correction of deformity, stabilization of unstable joints and balance of muscle power.	0.5821579253447277
This study was carried out from 1986 to 1996 to evaluate the technique of translaminal epidural endoscopic discectomy in lumbar hernias occupying over 50% of the radicular canal, foraminal hernias, and hernias invading it entirely.	0.6180441106396566
This minimally invasive arthroscopic technique was applied in patients suffering from degenerative lumbar stenosis between L3 and S1.	0.36945142272265924
The first part of the study dealt with lumbar hernias.	0.6173025054632323
Of a total of 222 patients, 175 (78.82%) showed radicular canal invasion ranging between 50 and 90%.	0.6366887298915301
The disc level was L4-L5 in 59%, L5-S1 in 39%, and L3-L4 in 4%.	0.4651503978650402
Most of these hernias were lateral extrusions.	0.4375849753030685
However, the study also included protrusions and foraminal hernias, since they were large and technically difficult to operate on.	0.6761697542085573
In terms of distribution,  25 patients (14.28%) had protrusions and 120 (68.57%) extrusions, and in 30 patients (17.14%) hernias had migrated.	0.8882751680475067

A possible intraoperative complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy is opening of the gallbladder with subsequent loss of gallstones.	0.5756186464107645
We report on a 61-year-old woman who was hospitalised with an obscure subhepatic tumor.	0.5370165812832955
Intraoperatively an abscess was found that had been caused by lost gallstones following after laparoscopic cholecystectomy 3 years previously.	0.5168915219047419
There is a low incidence of late abscesses caused by loss of gallstones, but because of the long latency and unspecific symptoms there may be problems in diagnosis.	0.7249238148543491
Taking into consideration possible complications caused by intraoperative loss of gallstones, all concrements should be retrieved, even though there is no indication for changing to an open procedure.	0.6534542250544614
Since squamous cell carinoma of the penis is rare, prospective trials do not exist.	0.5152549830318748

The findings included different stages of proliferation of the superficial layer, uncharacteristic inflammatory reactions of the stratum synoviale and fibrosis of the stroma, vascular proliferation and pseudopolypoid thickening of the synovial membrane.	0.5870256704272682
The histomorphological findings can only be interpreted reliably and a pathogenetic classification obtained, e.g., detritus synovialitis, rheumatoid arthritis or post-traumatic changes, if the arthroscopic findings conclude an exact documentation of the biopsy site and the clinical findings.	0.5908259406346429
The aim of this study was to determine the impact of prolonged single lung ventilation and intrathoracic insufflation of CO2 during computer-enhanced totally endoscopic bypass grafting on biventricular myocardial function.	0.49541902802443044
Methods: Transesophageal echocardiography was performed intraoperatively in 20 patients undergoing the above mentioned operation.	0.59297101429918
At distinct time points during the intervention, a cine-loop of both ventricles was registered employing a mid short axis view.	0.4471909234552911
Simultaneously, oxygenation parameters as well as electrocardiographic data and intrathoracic CO2 pressure were taken.	0.47887490066140803
Wall motion analysis was done postoperatively.	0.4511510244551973
Results: With increasing duration of single lung ventilation, significant regional and global biventricular hypokinesia was detected.	0.5960094487468115
This was accompanied by a decrease in PaO2 and a marked increase in intrathoracic CO2 pressure.	0.5031555125939399
These alterations disappeared after weaning from extracorporeal circulation and reconstitution of double lung ventilation.	0.355604426012898
Conclusion: These results show that computer-enhanced coronary artery bypass grafting leads to significant alterations in intraoperative biventricular myocardial function.	0.5644236110803328
This can be due to either an impact on oxygenation during single lung ventilation or due to intrathoracic CO2 insufflation.	0.4487682628475995
However, in our group, these alteration showed only small clinical relevance.	0.8311817050913949
During the last few years the fast development of different laser and laser-like systems for photoepilation and their one-sided representation in media has led to confusion among pysicians and patients.	0.5037729048525188
The object of this review is to give a structured report of different pulsed laser and laser-like systems (Epilight, Photoderm, long-pulsed ruby-, alexandrite- and diodelaser) that are available in Germany, including their side effects and complications.The current status of scientific investigation in this field is discussed.	0.717937408688099
The purpose of the present study was to increase the free range of motion in conventional trust-plate prosthesis design and to optimize the trust-plate contact as well as the osteointegration area below the trust-plate.	0.6329111432234995
Although familial occurrence of fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) has been commonly observed, data on a genetic role in this condition are limited.	0.6319270466361363
A few studies have reported familial aggregation and association with HLA.	0.48332650848389197
We have studied genetic linkage of FMS with HLA in multicase families, and found a rather weak linkage of FMS with HLA (P<0.029).	0.49624696469099816
Malformations of the urinary tract are one of the most common types of anomalies in the neonatal period.	0.642169343653116
Approximately 15-20% of all prenatally detected malformations  require acute postnatal imaging.	0.6557953334151787
Sonography is the primary imaging modality in the evaluation of nephro-urologic problems in infancy.	0.45800870034208246
Hydronephrosis represents the most common pathology, followed by multicystic-dysplastic kidney.	0.5119230060640161
Discussion: The result of the sonographic examination directs further imaging.	0.7323380981669716
An adequate diagnostic algorithm is decisive  for accurate diagnosis, for the appropriate therapeutic regimen and for the prognosis  of the patients.	0.8460166573438764
Calcification is one of the main causes of failure of porcine bioprosthetic heart valves, a problem which has not been satisfactorily solved to date.	0.627608241508588
Previous studies have shown that calcification is decreased in porcine heart valves that have undergone treatment for lipid extraction.	0.468735666346464
The relation between lipid distribution and calcification of seven new commercially available porcine bioprosthetic heart valves (St. Jude Medical, Bioimplant) is assessed by Sudan red III staining to show preexisting lipids.	0.4706428407537455
All porcine bioprosthetic valves contained lipids to different degrees.	0.2886513212234784
Five valves were subjected to the pulsatile accelerated calcification process for 4 weeks.	0.33802336454437293
Distribution and level of calcification were evaluated by radiography and compared to the Sudan red-stained fatty areas.	0.5630223672928707
Comparison of the calcifications detected by radiography and the macroscopically detected lipids showed a coincidence of 57-66%.	0.4630497905890277
Two porcine bioprosthetic valves were histologically prepared and stained with Hematoxylin and von Kossa's stain, respectively.	0.30144481436269693
By light microscopy, the von Kossa staining revealed microcalcifications and polarizing microscopic investigation showed birefractive substances in areas with lipid deposits.	0.4247695673881941
These preexisting substances in porcine valve tissue may play a determinative role in the calcification of the tissue.	0.48988921991680784
Substantial studies are necessary to further determine the role of preexisting lipids in calcification.	0.4785336041934306
Therapy for hip dysplasia and DDH by means of sonography.	0.4000654608357139
Numerous methods are available for treating "congenital" dysplasia of the hip (CDH).	0.6081980908474447
The important point seems to be the differentiation between dysplastic hip joints with and without displaced femoral heads.	0.6329056761840032
A historical review of the diagnosis of so-called "congenital dysplasia" and dislocation of the hip and different indications for therapeutic maneuvers is given.	0.7089944301290105
Generally, a three-step plan of treatment is recommended: dislocated heads must be reduced, after which retention is needed until the hip joint is stable.	0.7154577639882777
This is followed by maturation period, until the nonossified hyalin cartilagineous performed acetabular roof is ossified.	0.34128569768279854
All hip joints, regardless of age, can be assigned to one of these phases.	0.628990669692799
In all cases, measures are taken to prevent ischemic necrosis of the femoral head.	0.5385281220786604
To prevent the residual dysplasia of the acetabulum roof and femoral head necrosis, the reduction-retention position should be more than 90  ° flexion in the hip joint, but not more than 45-50  ° abduction.	0.8303664260573381
In each therapeutic phase there is a different biomechanical situation in the hip joint.	0.5283668112027041
The appropriate orthosis for treatment is chosen according to the particular biomechanical situation.	0.4411654274453826
Each sonographic type can be set up according to the our classification in the three-phase treatment system.	0.5889972110307012
In this way the adequate orthosis for treatment in each treatment-phase can be chosen.	0.6048868304538804
A case of a patient with malignant acanthosis nigricans in association with carcinoma of the lung is reported, documenting successful palliative treatment of the warty papillomatous thickening of the lips with electrocautery.	0.6888500493438313
Molecular atmospheric oxygen contains two unpaired electrons in the unreactive triplet state and thus has to be activated in order to react with other biological molecules in the singlet ground state.	0.3837863289758955
These processes of activation include very reactive intermediates.	0.25188150306407137
Therefore, aerobic cells must cope with - and to some extent also adapt to - oxidative stress provoked for example by infection or intoxication, where reactive intermediates of oxygen activation accumulate.	0.7144299389429491
Depending on the strength of these impacts, several symptoms indicate the deviation from normal, steady-state metabolism.	0.4917174019420477
Most of these visible or measurable symptoms are connected with oxygen activation where principally a transition from heterolytic reactions (two-electron transitions) to increased homolytic reactions (one-electron transitions) is observed.	0.5763248007464421
Homolytic reactions produce free radicals, which are generally counteracted by a parallel increase of intrinsic radical scavenging processes or by compounds administered with food, thus warranting metabolic control within certain limits.	0.5354507880808946
At advanced states of stress, control may be gradually lost and chaotic radical processes dominate.	0.3694961020028221
Finally, cellular decompartmentalizations yield apoptotic, lytic and/or necrotic processes.	0.3520126761285579
Every episode during this cascade is characterizable by the balance between pro- and antioxidative capacities.	0.45084666490048647
Antioxidants, which in many cases are free radical scavengers or quenchers of activated states, comprise a wealth of classes of organic molecules including phenolics, probably as the most prominent ones.	0.6382060739590761
In this article, mechanisms of oxygen activation and protection from oxidative damage are discussed.	0.4599227087491862
Furthermore, examples of antioxidative functions of a few important natural products are reported.	0.421076295256769
In a monocenter prospective randomized double-blind clinical trial the efficacy of homeopathic treatment was investigated on children with adenoid vegetations justifying an operation.	0.4160320241600475
Patients were treated with either homeopathic remedies such as Nux vomica D200, Okoubaka D3, Tuberculinum D200, Barium jodatum D4 and Barium jodatum D6 or with placebo.	0.4382821684212489
The duration of the study for each patient was 3 months.	0.9819259491950941
Examination of the ears using a microscope, rhinoscopy, stomatoscopy and pharyngoscopy, as well as tympanometry and audiometry were performed after 4, 8 and 12 weeks.	0.5513252675754479
Out of a total of 97 children studied between the ages of 4 to 10 years 82 could be analyzed.	0.5482234328345675
At the end of the study no operation was required in 70.7% of the placebo-treated children and in 78.1% of the children treated with homeopathic preparations.	0.7612494203173893
These results show no statistical significance.	0.5823759554884367
A treatment technique favorable for linacs with asymmetric jaws, which combined cranio-caudal matching fields with fields enclosing the whole target volume, is investigated with respect to field matching and sparing of normal tissue and organs at risk.	0.438589057412871
For a pelvic target volume rapidly varying in cranio-caudal direction a 5-field technique was planned with individually weighted and blocked fields.	0.4479437245456817
Three fields adjoining in cranio-caudal direction were completed by 2 fields enclosing the whole target volume.	0.30647804904047504
The matching line was measured and calculated with Helax TMS©.	0.43010703075533985
Furthermore a 4-field box and opposing fields were planned.	0.3466599289929066
The dose-volume histograms for target, bladder, intestine and soft tissue were exported.	0.5226574513303068
Normal tissue complication probability and tumor control probability, respectively, were calculated for all techniques.	0.5658407890953181
In the region of the matching line the summation of the measured normalized curves resulted in relative dose maxima of 6.0% (caudal) and 4.5% (cranial), respectively.	0.6495570334827688
For fields enclosing the whole target volume the dose maxima in the region of the matching line decreased to 2.0% (caudal) and 1.8% (cranial), respectively.	0.6479073842289327
For the dose profiles calculated with Helax TMS© no overdose was found.	0.30797615978358217
The 5-field technique with adjoining fields results in a better sparing of the organs at risk compared to the other techniques, whereas the tumor control remains the same.	0.7404427196925116
In specific cases a technique with cranio-caudal adjoining fields can be recommended with respect to sparing of normal tissue and organs at risk.	0.47135935585396876
Disseminated Langerhans-cell-histiocytosis (LCH) is most frequent in children at the age of 1-3 years, seldomly seen in adults and extremely rare in the elderly.	0.7247751587685197
The clinical course may be acute, subacute or chronic, progressive or stationary.	0.6660893365017371
Spontaneous remissions are possible, but rare.	0.5805740204057032
In elderly patients often the disease is at first limited to the skin before it becomes systemic.	0.719100074054038
Because of its central location, the elbow joint is considered the most important joint within the upper extremity from the viewpoint of function.	0.7866571630519601
Trauma to osseous and ligamentous structures of the proximal forearm confronts trauma surgeons and orthopedic specialists with numerous diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.	0.5387942780751707
Conditions following elbow trauma are often accompanied by chronic pain and diminished range of motion, leading to functional deficits of the entire arm.	0.5780488346723952
There is now practically no doubt that primary osteosynthesis, anatomical joint reconstruction and early onset of functional treatment are essential for a good final outcome.	0.6180901148194782
With our expanding knowledge of the anatomical and biomechanical condtions in the proximal lower arm in the last few decades the basic principles of therapy have also changed, and current standards of treatment for proximal forearm trauma are presented in this paper with reference to the relevant literature.	0.8026181771777519
The series of five patients with symptomatic isolated right ventricular outflow tract ectopy and no structural heart disease which were successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation of the ectopic focus are reported in order to discuss radiofrequency ablation as an alternative treatment in patients with right ventricular outflow tract ectopy without ventricular tachycardia.	0.6253986635798288
Basic principles for treating patients with chronic pain are presented.	0.6551197577789067
They are the result of a longterm collaboration of collegues from different medical specialties in the pain outpatient unit of the University of Ulm.	0.556341145386374
In contrast to a variety of literature on chronic pain patients, these principles focus on the contribution of the therapists to the development of problems in treatment.	0.6800114222703135
Eight principles, considered especially important for the treatment of chronic pain patients are presented and discussed.	0.8210816597296191
We discuss this entity with the aid of a case report and the existing literature.	0.6493911587519975
The therapy of these tumors includes resection and possible adjuvant radiotherapy.	0.6183769339023114
Rhabdomyosarcomas are an exception, because they also show a good response to chemotherapy.	0.6697109647552248
14 human femurs were scanned by CAT and 3D reconstructed.	0.23552373073154606
In every specimen digital documentation of CCD and antetorsion (AT) angle was performed.	0.3945612961222318
With a special software package (Orthodoc) virtual preoperative planning for implantation of a cementless total hip alloplasty was undertaken.	0.5002013575300625
The specimens were randomised into two groups, one of which had manual and the other one robot implantation of the femoral component.	0.807386283170246
After implantation all specimens were evaluated again by CAT and CCT and AT angle were documented again.	0.37771616865309254
The preoperative CCD angle was 126.7  ° (SD = 4.0) in the manual group and 127.8  ° (SD = 4.3) in the robodoc group.	0.7562572941801128
Postoperatively the angle averaged 131.9  ° (SD = 0.8) in the manual group and 133.2  ° (SD = 1.9) in the robodoc group.	0.7714762773356926
Significant differences were found for the AT angle in both groups.	0.7016584698587255
The preoperative AT angle in the manual group was 31.3  ° (SD = 8.8), decreasing to 20.5  ° (SD = 9.5) after implantation.	0.7398957384990247
In the robodoc group this angle was 30.9  ° (SD = 8.0) before and 31.3  ° (SD = 8.7) after implantation.	0.7323246118757526
The difference between pre- and postoperative AT angle averaged 10.8  ° (SD = 6.4) in the manual group and only 0.4  ° (SD = 0.9) in the robodoc-group.	0.9015681837056174
Conclusion: With the technique used, preoperative planning in hip alloarthroplasty is much more accurate than with the conventional technique with plain X-ray.	0.7269382256942397
The virtual preoperative planning can be transferred to the intraoperative setting with high precision.	0.4743933297953315
These factors may lead to an increase in outcome quality.	0.5349518933542258
1000 drug-related fatalities that were examined in Hamburg from 1990-1996 by the Institute of Legal Medicine were analysed with respect to consumption of substitute drugs such as methadone.	0.5461507108998498
The incidence of methadone-related fatalities has increased in the last two years.	0.8709885074868715
The highest incidence was found in 1995 when methadone was detected in the blood of about 20% of all drug-related fatalities.	0.8822739471579587
Lethal monointoxications or combined intoxications with a dominant role of methadone were experienced rarely (about 1% of all drug-related fatalities).	0.6308545841648495
Of the persons who were enroled since 1990 in a methadone maintenance programme 2% have been registered as drug- related fatalities.	0.533874816617571
The mortality of street addicts without comparable medical help was about 10% in the same period.	0.6590152836944566
There is further need for improved methods of registration, documentation and forensic/sociological analysis of all drug-related fatalities for reliable conclusions concerning mortality rates of drug users who are enroled in methadone maintenance programmes.	0.49185860653201036
Pulmonary infections and tumors are a major cause of death in patients with AIDS.	0.6658427692266216
The combination of clinical, radiological, laboratory, and pathohistological data helps to narrow the spectrum of differential diagnoses or even allows a specific diagnosis in many patients.	0.5858874358820484
Nevertheless, an accurate diagnosis should be obtained as soon as possible during the clinical course of the illness to initiate treatment in time.	0.7140248373463819
Computed tomography (CT) has proven to provide promising results in the diagnosis of AIDS-related thoracic diseases.	0.6722067389731687
The aim of this paper was to demonstrate the diagnostic capacities of CT in the context of particular AIDS-related thoracic pathologies.	0.7139225081507705
Additional information on the spectrum of pathological agents and on differential diagnostic signs is summarized.	0.5220453839170546
This study was designed to provide information to which extend home-based nursing care services for the elderly take part in the care for older people with mental disorders.	0.7026126247403316
Also of interest was the involvement of clinical facilities and services of the geropsychiatric treatment system in the health care for the clients.	0.5181711520150926
A one day data collection in 29 nursing care services in two North Rhine-Westphalian regions could raise informations about 1,246 clients aged 60 years and over 1, 522 persons (41.8%) had a mental disorder, diagnosed by a nursing and/or medical professional.	0.5834040911159378
68% of the mental disordered clients had dementia or a demential disorder, 6% a functional psychoses, and 31% a neurotic, psychogenic disorder or substance abuse (small number of clients with two and more diagnoses).	0.6391806056852057
82% of clients with mental disorders had one or more additional somatic disease(s).	0.5325108772670863
These diseases were mostly the cause for the involvement of home-based nursing care service.	0.5272035703725786
Barely 8% of clients with mental disorders were placed from clinical facilities and services of the geropsychiatric treatment system into the nursing care services.	0.4751664846635353
Beside the home-based care, only 12% of mental disordered received clients outpatient psychiatric treatment.	0.6388575350483134
Systematic cooperation between the nursing care services and the system of (gero-) psychiatric treatemnt was a rare exception.	0.6547984437200384
Acute cerebral nerve paresis can be caused in many different ways.	0.4764994538339406
One of the more rare causes of paresis of one or more neural pathways is dissection of the internal carotid artery.	0.5832710642087853
Early diagnosis is important, even with atypical symptoms, since prompt anticoagulative therapy can hinder stroke from embolism due to the dissection.	0.6789284915829008
We report on two patients with Raeder's syndrome and Collet-Sicard syndrome resulting from dissection of the internal carotid artery.	0.5373841280432935
Besides the cranial and caudal nerves involved in our study, loss of function has also been reported with the sixth to eighth cranial nerves, so that any painful, sudden cranial nerve deficiency can indicate possible carotid dissection.	0.5457726558247726
In hematopoiesis, regulation and differentiation present a very complex functional network in which multiple factors of the microenvironment are involved.	0.4709890841858713
In addition to direct cell-to-cell contacts and the modifying influences of the intercellular matrix, soluble mediators play an important role in intercellular communication.	0.5432848355252102
Cytokines exert their effects by binding with specific receptors that transfer their signals to individual cells.	0.3339479266830459
A common structure shared by subunits of these receptors leads to competitive inhibition in binding the cytokines with different affinity.	0.3777469671030745
By this mechanism specificity is reduced, on the one hand; however, on the other the complexity of interactions in the bone marrow is enhanced.	0.7181781798325805
A flood of in vitro and in vivo studies have established the impact of various cytokines on single hematopoietic cell lineages and their application for clinical use.	0.4975267150714685
However, there is a lack of knowledge concerning the cellular origin of the cytokines.	0.625875180502735
According to the results of our studies elements of the erythro- and megakaryopoiesis are the source of cytokines like IL-1, IL-3, IL-6, and GM-CSF.	0.7668293646500297
Wound healing represents a dynamic process of increasing scientific interest, especially with the detection of the different growth factors.	0.7449626571238629
Economic aspects are also of importance in the investigation of substances used for wound healing.	0.6250371138082268
In Germany 25% of all patients (ca.	0.7620005124447244
1 million) with severe chronic venous insufficiency have crural ulcers.	0.6225933988243144
The influence of bacterial infection of crural ulcers is controversial.	0.4750876298072711
There is no doubt that the quantity of bacteria is of importance.	0.5165070183731334
Local antibiotic treatment is difficult, as most of the substances used are known to inhibit wound healing.	0.8029680728036022
In vivo and in vitro investigations showed, that chiniofon-containing antiseptic has a bacteriostatic function.	0.5754884457512184
Additionally it was shown, using cultures of fibroblasts, that chiniofon-containing antiseptic does not inhibit the growth of fibroblasts, whereas PVP-iodine solution, a widely used antiseptic, clearly reduces the growth of fibroblasts.	0.6689240474266354
The good clinical results in the treatment of acute and chronic radiation damage indicate that chiniofon-containing antiseptic may have antiflammatory activity.	0.6257327976694645
This article presents the heuristics concerning description of individual generative behavior.	0.359687590242785
The aim is to describe the development of the desire for children, the generative action and the dealing with generative decisions for intended and unintended childless women and men as well as parents.	0.5608540317942511
The main emphasis of the existing heuristics is placed on psychological questions.	0.3728415738497954
These heuristics explain patterns and influencing factors of generative action as well as positive and negative influencing factors of the coping process.	0.5466279974712666
It may be helpful to use heuristics which describe development of and coping with generative action as background information to ensure comprehensive consultation and therapy planning.	0.5073104843806535
Morbus Parkinson is a progressive degenerative disease of the human central, peripheral, and enteric nervous systems.	0.6373800983874792
In the course of the disease, not only the substantia nigra, but also extranigral components of the motor system, as well as numerous limbic system and autonomic centers undergo serious damage.	0.6872667120166847
Accordingly, Parkinson's disease is a multisystem disorder.	0.5977494789428902
Only specific types of projection neurons fall victim to it.	0.2476522166173152
The first manifestation of the pathological process which causes the disease are abnormalities of the neuronal cytoskeleton.	0.5967236197493012
Intracytoplasmic inclusions evolving in the form of Lewy bodies in perikarya and Lewy neurites in the neuronal processes result in premature cell death of the affected neurons.	0.40891862989408617
On the basis of this selective neuronal vulnerability, a categorization emerges of the pathological changes within the nervous system and corresponding functional impairments.	0.5658036243398773
