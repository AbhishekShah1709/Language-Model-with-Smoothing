Today, this green position is being threatened under pressure from, in particular, the German and French car industries.	0.8336842557042557
That is why I urge you to vote against Amendments Nos 38 and 45.	0.7099266830244321
We, the Green Group, by and large support the common position.	0.846649689758145
Mr President, the waste from end-of-life vehicles is one of our really major environmental problems in terms both of the quantity of waste and of emissions of environmentally hazardous substances.	0.7085380406755822
We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left therefore want as comprehensive and consistent a set of regulations as is humanly possible in this area.	0.5528258856372481
With this directive, we have the chance to take a big step forward, but this presupposes that the Council' s position is not torn to shreds and weakened in Parliament' s reading of it.	0.9009298423202335
If they were adopted, many of the amendments which have been tabled would considerably weaken the directive.	0.914418035492609
This applies, above all, to amendments from the Group of the European People' s Party but also, unfortunately, to some of the amendments from Mr Lange, as I see it.	0.9235386630023202
It is easy to see that the car industry in certain countries, for example in Germany, went in for some pretty tough lobbying before the present directive was adopted.	0.7646313037855261
For ourselves, it is crucial that the following principles should apply.	0.6879784332023091
The polluter should pay.	0.17271955901054348
This means that it is the manufacturer which should take full responsibility, financial as well as otherwise, for recycling vehicles.	1.0186131807856014
There must be rules governing existing vehicles too.	0.4103050240159834
Where this aspect is concerned, we cannot accept any weakening of the Council' s position regarding the date from which the regulations are to come into force.	0.9014744932832964
There should be no falling-off in the percentages concerned or in the requirements for recycling vehicles from particular years, and it is important to limit the use of dangerous substances such as lead.	0.8078629938994407
We shall vote against any amendments which run counter to these considerations.	0.49581441137295423
If those amendments were adopted which would considerably weaken the directive, this would be very detrimental, not only from an environmental point of view but also for the European Parliament' s credibility on environmental issues.	0.8880140122402073
Reference was made earlier on in the debate to the fact that some thought should be given to the millions of people who work in the car industry in various countries and to those countries which have large car industries, for example my own country, Sweden.	1.0246749597507354
I was myself a car worker before I was elected.	0.39973367523986947
I believe I am one of the few members of this Parliament to have stood beside a production line and assembled cars.	0.8262719981606969
I think that very tough demands should be made of the car industry.	0.8212221904978269
These would, of course, be to the advantage of modern, progressive car manufacturers who think in environmentally friendly terms.	0.6152803045987579
It is precisely this type of car industry which we should be encouraging in the European Union.	0.9811606402708988
Mr President, I am very pleased that environmental protection is now a priority for this Parliament, as indeed it is for the citizens of Europe.	1.1650625748008494
There is no doubt that abandoned cars represent a serious threat to the visual and physical environment.	0.5609931647707393
Our citizens expect us in this regard to protect their interests.	0.7964005560343357
Each year, there are between 8 and 9 million vehicles scrapped within the European Union. This in itself generates a large amount of waste.	0.8442750209365878
Car manufacturers, the suppliers of materials and equipment manufacturers must make an effort to limit the use of hazardous substances and therefore must ensure at the design stage that recycled materials can be used in the manufacture of cars.	0.6300144394692382
We know that in the Netherlands there are authorised treatment centres in place to collect end-of-life vehicles and this process should be extended across the length and breadth of the European Union.	0.6823662199220043
From an Irish perspective, I know that the Irish Department of the Environment is already having consultations with motor industry representatives to ensure that appropriate collection centres are put in place in Ireland in the near future to deal with end-of-life vehicles.	0.8111556207438492
I see no reason why licensing arrangements cannot be organised across Europe for collection centres to scrap the 8 to 9 million vehicles which are disposed of within the European Union on an annual basis.	0.5901807877757679
Car manufacturers will have to provide information on the rate of re-use, recycling and recovery of used cars which will be achieved in the coming years.	0.8892277534118542
In accordance with new provisions included in the Amsterdam Treaty all the 370 million consumers within the European Union have a right to consumer-related information.	0.6589002045062565
I believe EU consumers will support those car manufacturers that incorporate the most environmentally-friendly practices in the coming year.	0.5298307605250319
My final point is that the regulations and the legislation must take into account the special position of the vintage car sector throughout the European Community because of its role in relation to the social sector and its environmental and economic considerations.	0.9013599366731516
Mr President, the directive on end-of-life vehicles is certainly a milestone in the improvement of the environment in Europe.	0.7973176533807194
I also think that a great effort has been made to arrive at intelligent recycling of materials, a reduction of polluting waste and the promotion of technological innovation.	0.8590442565809125
In this regard, we are certainly on the right track, but as some Members have already stressed, the real issue here is the possibility that manufacturers' responsibility will become a shared responsibility.	1.0345456628368905
I would like to say that in Italy, considerable headway has been made in this sector; we are perhaps the first in Europe to have regulations encouraging us to take end-of-life vehicles off the market, but in our country the average age of cars on the road is rather high, and we therefore have serious concerns over the problems that this directive could entail for the market.	0.9802234139101056
We need to conduct a serious analysis of the matter.	0.6171063320390231
In Italy, we have begun to withdraw and recycle around 80% of old cars, but there is a market problem which could trigger a crisis - in terms of unemployment given that in Italy industry often resorts to lay-offs and redundancies - and cause problems for workers in different parts of Italy.	0.7398370814715729
We must therefore try to reconcile the two requirements - Parliament is sometimes a little extremist, adopting positions that are either extremely pro-green or extremely anti-green - and, all things considered, find a way to combine the effort made by Mr Florenz and that of other Members, who are trying to reconcile the two positions as best as possible.	0.818314850236702
These worthwhile amendments are the outcome of this; I think that we will be able to arrive at a solution to the problem, that is, to reconcile environmental requirements with market and labour requirements.	0.8983576550184372
Mr President, this directive deals with the comparatively small but growing problem of abandoned cars and the question of a more structured disposal of all cars at the end of their life.	0.7903135836862804
To that extent, it might be thought desirable, even if it is not a matter of urgent necessity.	1.1028005499414006
The key questions now are who pays the EUR 262 per car for the 9 million cars that are disposed of each year?	0.39831706809996154
Who pays for the collection, the dismantling, the disposal and so on?	0.8321062904276204
And should the directive be retrospective to cover every car that has ever been made?	0.45365925142799324
The proposal from the Council, the common position, is that manufacturers should pay the lot.	1.0232143555543984
That would mean billions of pounds or euros for each of the major companies in each of the countries of the European Union.	0.7189366812634258
That cost would inevitably be passed on to the price and hence to the buyers of new cars.	0.47520753668834526
Because European car manufactures have been operating here for many, many more decades than companies from Japan, Korea and elsewhere, that would be a much greater burden on the older European companies and a competitive gift to their competitors from elsewhere.	0.6520390913392125
I commend Mr Florenz, Mr Lange and others who have sought from both sides of the party divide a compromise based on shared costs.	0.668297026948636
I also commend to you the amendment standing in my name and colleagues from Germany, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Sweden and Britain, to remove the retrospective nature of this measure.	0.6844455366492623
Retrospective law is bad law, it is unfair law and often it is unworkable law.	0.5317963645062382
Most democratic parliaments in the free world reject it on principle unless there is overwhelming public interest, which clearly there is not in this case.	0.9068499043595272
That is why I have called for a roll-call vote on this.	0.7585336452807419
We can see who is prepared to vote for a retrospection which is of doubtful legality, which would be a costly burden to every future car buyer and a devastating blow for the European car industry.	0.8817668470869282
Mr President, once again I would like to briefly outline the economic issues involved in this directive, and reaffirm my support for the amendments tabled by my colleague, Bernd Lange.	0.8283698931327672
These amendments actually have the advantage - and I should like to stress this - of reconciling environmental constraints and economic imperatives.	0.767133588552329
The Council' s common position was to say that car manufacturers should bear all, or a significant part, of the costs of recovery and recycling.	0.9975897950282837
But, as Mr Lange so rightly said, this solution is totally unfair to European car manufacturers.	0.9431890301618915
Coming from a country which does have a car manufacturing industry, I can tell you that it is not possible, retroactively, to impose on them the total financial costs for all vehicles of their makes currently on the road, i.e. effectively making them bear the costs arising from 80% of the total number of cars in Europe.	0.8290214062468615
This solution is unacceptable because these car manufacturers have not had the opportunity to build the environmental demands we are making of them today into their manufacturing procedures and their manufacturing costs.	0.6374564994782257
The common position puts European car manufacturers in a disadvantageous position in relation to manufacturers which have just come to the European market.	0.7930259019219679
Of course, we are not here to defend a particular national interest or a particular industrial lobby. We are here to build a Europe that is competitive on the world market and to safeguard jobs in economic sectors where we are actually competitive.	0.9088039826203868
This is why, I urge you to support the amendments tabled by Bernd Lange. These amendments will be supported by the Group of the Party of European Socialists since they effectively reconcile all the interests involved - economic interests and environmental constraints - while granting Member States the freedom to select the means to implement these constraints, since these amendments envisage that the systems in place in the Members States, and some of them work perfectly well, will be able to continue to operate.	0.9376190745527719
Mr President, Commissioner, the proposed directive on end-of-life vehicles before us today aims firstly to guarantee a high level of environmental protection in the Union, but also to safeguard the proper operation of the internal market in this sector.	0.8499124258020261
Let me briefly say that historic and vintage vehicles must, of course, be exempt from the scope of this directive.	0.6516811875666317
Cars are also part of our cultural heritage. I think we would all agree on that.	1.021552306200534
Having said that, one of the stumbling blocks concerns Article 12, i.e. the date on which the directive will come into force.	0.8021343520727701
Parliament' s proposed solution of 18 months following the directive' s entry into force, for new vehicles, is not terribly realistic.	0.8609189151627147
The European car population amounts to several tens of millions of cars which will have to be recovered even though they were not designed for recycling.	0.7834103474257726
The common position was more feasible since it envisaged 2006 for vehicles already on the road.	0.592581797087685
This would, furthermore, make it possible to allow firms time to make funds available to meet these additional expenses.	0.6128728810740453
Like my group, I shall therefore support this aspect the common position which, I feel, offers a balanced compromise between constraints upon firms and essential advances in environmental protection.	0.864653325282749
Mr President, the European Parliament is today facing an important decision.	1.0235245389431493
Will we give our backing to forward-looking environmental and consumer protection or, as the amendments of Florenz, Lange and others cause me to fear, will we allow ourselves to become a servant of the German car industry?	0.7300146719656887
The credibility of Parliament as a champion of environmental protection is at stake.	0.6826501844308109
It would be shameful to say the least if the European Parliament were to draw back from the professions the governments of the 14 Member States and the European Commission have been making concerning manufacturer responsibility and environmental protection!	0.939237438959989
The intention of Florenz and Lange in their amendments is obvious: to sabotage the directive!	0.4927369994615365
The proposed shared responsibility would undermine the polluter pays principle and detract from product innovation.	0.3963912097295742
In setting up numerous hurdles their sole aim is to hamper an efficient ecological material flow policy and by going down the road of type approvals they seek to delay the implementation of the directives by 12 years or more.	0.5211494368480286
This is totally unacceptable.	0.3796193409419411
I therefore appeal to the German delegates in particular to prevent major political damage occurring today!	0.605855849948957
The red-green federal government has not exactly covered itself with glory in the debate on the End-of-life Vehicles Directive.	0.5272300384996101
Do not continue in this vein!	0.4852281291177279
The whinging about competitive disadvantages is laughable if it only concerns competitive disadvantages sustained by the German car industry.	0.3776978012732093
Start representing your people and not just your car manufacturers!	0.5809766707289555
Vote in favour of environmental and consumer protection and for innovation in the car and recycling industry!	0.6488271759598008
Mr President, this directive has been under discussion since 1997.	0.9800690321955862
It is high time that we reached an agreement.	0.5066321498661961
Since I more or less share the views of my colleague, Mr Sjöstedt and the representative of the Greens, Mr de Roo, I am not going to use the two minutes allotted to me, and I will highlight just two issues.	0.9517068334441146
Firstly, and this is perhaps the basic point of the proposal, the idea, which goes hand in hand with recycling and the use of waste, that we should use materials which will subsequently cause less pollution.	1.0602702475171328
Another point is that waste should not be incinerated or crushed, not only in the case of lead, cadmium and mercury, but also in the case of waste which contains PVC.	0.850938723523188
Parliament is currently discussing this issue in another context.	0.6311616223387736
The other question is who should bear the cost.	0.5366565530940882
I agree with previous speakers who have said that the polluter should pay, and this proposal expresses that idea very well.	0.8361261610346794
Producers must pay - although we all know that the consumer will ultimately suffer the consequences of this - and they must take responsibility for the costs before 2006, as some of the amendments propose.	1.1287012945410493
We are more in agreement with the amendment proposed at first reading.	0.719648670396086
It is also important to set percentages and a date for vehicles to be composed of recyclable materials.	0.6227410977770873
I believe that this proposal relies on very long deadlines.	0.7521472812187774
Lastly, Mr President, I believe we should favour the creation of small and medium-sized businesses which, if subject to rigorous approval and duly authorised, can promote the creation of jobs in this very important area, preventing the emergence of monopolies by large companies.	0.8269319039710974
Mr President, today the European Parliament must face up to real responsibilities.	0.9596514230570635
We have to work out what we are going to do with the millions of vehicles we abandon each year.	0.894531900483685
In some of our Member States, voluntary environmental agreements have already been signed to ensure that our ditches, canals and fields are not filled with these ugly and dangerous wrecks, inhabited occasionally by an alarmed farmyard chicken.	0.5360869965092423
I come, of course, from a country that is proud of its car industry and of its commercial success both in Europe and in third countries.	0.8191936194054152
I can gauge its importance for my country' s international reputation.	0.3845388912397284
I know of the proactive attitude of the European car manufacturing industry which has set up an extensive research programme to outline a national information system for dismantling end-of-life vehicles.	0.705249750762398
I am aware of the difficulties the Council experienced in finding a compromise.	0.6481971040182801
That is why, today, we must be understanding alchemists, concerned for our environment.	0.8790408206123864
This will either be the century of waste management or it will not.	0.612021801863082
As far as I am concerned, at least, the principle of 'polluter pays' must be applied.	0.8054683577192882
The car industry, increasingly more respectful of the environment, has, I am sure, anticipated this kind of increasing awareness.	0.8863145655974333
Indeed it is accepting its responsibilities.	0.3602834128406632
It is the Member States, however, who will have to implement this directive, and let us beware of going into too much detail because the industrial traditions, the demolition and crushing sectors vary according to whether you are in Italy or in Finland.	0.8330780456324055
I am opposed to making the car owners liable.	0.3944221941812172
The men and women on the move throughout Europe pay for their car and their catalytic converter, pay their national taxes and the tax on fuel and are therefore already paying a high price for their magnificent machine and their freedom of movement.	0.5434161677026732
It would certainly be unwise for my fellow Members in the major groups of the federalist tendency to seek to make the European Parliament unpopular in this way by creating a liability shared between the owner and the manufacturer.	0.8368250840163013
How, furthermore, can a fund be created which will pay for vehicle recycling and manage operations within Europe.	0.5358252502608475
Who is to pay for recycling the car I bought in France if I register it in Belgium?	0.5571374898827527
Which national fund will pay for my end-of-life vehicle?	0.48370201400908547
Let us beware, too, of worrying the world of business with the legal uncertainty of an unacceptable retroactive application.	0.7065775561308846
It is not our intention to start a punitive legislative campaign here today, but to continue on our present course, advocating sustainable development.	0.8043239984369305
Mr President, most of the time, the European Parliament, spearheaded by environment committees, does its very best to make a critical assessment of the proposals submitted by the European Commission or the Council, so as to improve on them from an environmental point of view.	0.9527494499454773
Now, a sound common position submitted by the Council is in danger of being changed for the worse from an environmental point of view here in Parliament.	0.8843348614230565
Every year, we discard a huge amount of cars which contain many dangerous substances.	0.6166794664433952
This is why it is important to prevent waste materials.	0.7432420499875781
We should also aim for minimum quantities of heavy metals, as well as of other dangerous substances and materials.	0.6819816441436839
In addition, car manufacturers need to produce and build these cars in such a way as to facilitate simple dismantling and re-use.	0.521162963631816
What is left of the stripped vehicle also requires to be processed adequately.	0.3412147711393758
I therefore welcome with open arms the percentage levels for re-use and recycling which have been proposed by the Council.	0.7346551037865988
These days, the complete dismantling of end-of-life vehicles is economically viable.	0.5571614743984229
This means that we move away from shredding.	0.6173587363107391
The prescribed objectives are most certainly viable and, in the Netherlands, a value of 86% recycling has now already been achieved.	0.7269000954128761
The best way of achieving proper collection is to ensure that the last holder and/or owner can deliver the car to an authorised treatment facility without any cost.	0.608292761716811
The processing cost can then be incorporated in the price of new cars.	0.517472134601791
The proposals made by a few MEPs impact greatly on this system.	0.5174955736238223
The so-called shared liability is very cumbersome and does not stimulate innovation.	0.35176956597540615
If the system of delivering cars to treatment facilities without any cost is applied, it will also transpire that the cost of processing will come down considerably.	0.7862532641882501
Finally, this directive should enter into force at the earliest opportunity.	0.923526562080287
A laborious conciliation procedure would entail an unnecessary delay, at the expense of the environment.	0.5734965078936541
Why cannot we just be satisfied with the common position currently tabled? If we are, then all that remains for us to do is to congratulate the Council on the result achieved.	0.9399572820801431
Mr President, I hold Mr Florenz in high esteem.	0.6678885063210623
He has delivered excellent work under pressure both from his colleagues and from the car industry.	0.6006741220542744
Add to this the fact that he had to do this from his green approach and, against that background, find a compromise. That was not easy.	0.968370921136124
Overall, I am not dissatisfied with the present common position and certainly not with the philosophy underlying that common position.	0.8467237270506053
I would like to comment on two things. Firstly, vintage cars and motorbikes.	0.5228509330783765
These should indeed be excluded from the directive. Secondly, the controversial question as to who bears the responsibility for taking back cars.	0.859488399701668
I do not wish to alter the text of the common position in any way.	0.8531429228344654
The manufacturer is and should be liable and the last holder and/or owner must be able to hand back the car without any cost.	0.5187632727454171
In my opinion, there is too much initial hesitation.	0.6501507962703305
The car lobby has led too many people up the garden path.	0.4956000617560082
I would also like to mention that experience has nonetheless taught us that the processing cost is in fact passed on.	0.7545010943950473
These costs are not very high.	0.6360773806873213
In the Member State where I come from, you are talking about 150 Guilders per car.	0.8479578461564633
If you charge this from day one, you can process the old cars straight away.	0.6292766371832347
A very large industry might then emerge which would ensure that scrapyards, which used to be a common feature in our Member States, would then disappear.	0.8746985268006329
I do not wish to make any changes to this particular aspect of the compromise.	0.7831329592564594
I think it would be a good thing if we were to approve the present legislation together as soon as possible.	0.8429665691577145
This is positive because, in that way, the nine million cars which are introduced each year onto European roads will actually be processed appropriately, and this will benefit us all.	0.8631158291004387
Mr President, the present directive is important in so far as it helps prevent our being faced with hazardous waste from end-of-life vehicles and in so far as it promotes the re-use and recycling of materials from scrapped cars.	0.7283529385634027
I therefore think it is crucial for the environment that the ban on using poisonous heavy metals should be fully implemented and that we should not reduce manufacturers' liability.	0.9488899697420932
If we do reduce it, we remove from manufacturers the incentive to design and produce cars which give rise to less waste.	0.665653383663031
The common position, which was arrived at with great difficulty in the Council, which the Commission has endorsed and which was also maintained in Parliament' s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, complies fully with the environmental requirements. I therefore find it incomprehensible and very curious to see amendments from members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, the objectives of which are to weaken the environmental requirements and significantly reduce car manufacturers' liability.	0.8263072388145986
If these amendments are adopted, I think that we shall cause Parliament seriously to lose credibility on environmental issues.	0.8331272747850593
So far, we here in Parliament have been positive catalysts for environmental protection but now, if the amendments proposed by Mr Florenz and Mr Lange are adopted, we are to become a negative factor for the environment in Europe.	0.9900713068142517
What is more, if we reduce manufacturers' liability on this issue, this will also have serious consequences for subsequent matters in other areas, for example the forthcoming directive on scrap from computers and other electronic equipment.	0.8762409161797851
I would therefore recommend to Members of Parliament that we cut across party lines and vote against all the amendments to the common position which would weaken environmental standards and reduce manufacturers' liability.	0.7253967926831608
We shall then be able to achieve an environmentally respectable result.	0.6259082674357875
Mr President, this excellent directive will end the dumping of old cars, encourage recycling, and above all encourage manufacturers to design cars which can easily be recycled.	0.7113141818783081
Now who should pay the costs?	0.5851069570584269
Whatever system is adopted, ultimately the cost will be passed on to the consumer.	0.6804629884800919
The best way of achieving our environmental objectives is to make the manufacturers our instrument both for collecting the money and for disposing and recycling of the cars.	0.6946927824807266
The manufacturers have tricked Mr Florenz and Mr Lange into tabling amendments here which seriously weaken these proposals.	0.4246360228409182
Do not be fooled by the car manufacturers!	0.33055542347339745
If you want the full benefits of this directive use your vote to throw out these amendments.	0.668271546988813
Mr President, Commissioner, this debate is not a technical debate, contrary to what we may think.	0.9280165680808539
It has become eminently political.	0.4453854203568361
Yesterday we honoured our institution with a political debate.	0.39335941909935934
Today, if 314 Members of Parliament yield to the strength of the lobbying of some car manufacturers, we should be doing ourselves dishonour.	0.8926993614659215
In expecting consumers to bear half the cost of the recovery of end-of-life vehicles, as Amendment No 38 stipulates, even though the common position states that all recovery costs should be borne by the manufacturer, Parliament would, for the first time, not be acting as the defender of the rights of the consumers and citizens of Europe, it would be turning into mere sounding box for different lobbies.	0.8091696494683358
We cannot accept this.	0.5208950336397036
It would be a precedent which would open the door to all sorts of pressure in many other areas.	0.7011926683708177
It would also be the first time that the European Parliament would be weakening a Council position, whereas usually we are complaining that their position is not strong enough.	0.9323519472364775
The free recovery system, for example, for old vehicles and raising the percentage to be recycled will increase recycling activities and the number of jobs this generates accordingly.	0.5987707615896685
Thus, for the consumer, for the environment and for the new jobs to be created in recycling, the Council' s common position definitely must not be amended. It is, as it stands, perfectly acceptable.	1.1774234971219877
Mr President, like so many others here today, I believe this is a good measure.	1.2061145371549615
This is a useful measure and it is one which we all need.	1.0931789061032882
Most of the technical issues have been resolved.	0.4319057583003676
There are some details to be finalised but most of the technical issues have been resolved.	0.6173279553052352
We have arrived at the final question.	0.4711540703438895
In the first reading debate it was only the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee which asked this question and it was only myself as the draftsman of the opinion of that committee who posed that question in Parliament. That is quite simply: Who pays?	1.0555124873085058
The Council common position reached a reasonable compromise in that the manufacturers should pay a significant part of the cost, not all of it as Mr Bowis has mistakenly said.	0.9050245855263174
In fact perhaps as little, the lawyers tell us, as 20% or one-fifth of the cost. That is not unreasonable.	0.9350055707833608
If you look at the UK consumer for example, who buys a Rover, as Mr Lange has indicated or for that matter any other make of car in the UK and who has for years been paying excessive prices for those cars, over and above comparable prices in other parts of Europe, why should they pay?	0.7541921586267769
They have paid already.	0.22440007930736644
Why should the very same people as taxpayers or as future car buyers, pay again to dispose of the vehicle that the manufacturer has made the profit from?	0.5619389468328437
I cannot accept that.	0.5374500217588065
There are amendments here today that are proposing that should be the case.	0.7952492229230591
I cannot accept it and I will not vote for it.	1.0716300811261297
The responsibility for these cars lies with the manufacturer.	0.5933652505333814
It is the manufacturer who has to provide the infrastructure and provide a reasonable part of the cost of disposal.	0.967444739479334
The common position does not preclude the possibility of contributions being made by government.	0.6037429249951546
The common position is a reasonable compromise.	0.9799597027845062
Some of the amendments today are totally unreasonable in that they take away completely the responsibility from the car manufacturer of paying a little if any of the cost of disposal of cars on the road.	0.7559525237573634
I cannot accept that and on behalf of the taxpayers and the consumers of Europe I am voting against those amendments.	0.608038993516172
Mr President, there is agreement that we must give some thought as to how we in Europe will properly deal with end-of-life cars, although in this instance the Council has not provided a model for a suitable European environment policy.	0.9844940565481034
It is disgraceful the way in which the German Presidency handled this matter.	0.5455210229471169
Firstly, Herr Trittin, the Environment Minister, was not in tune with his colleagues in the Cabinet, then Chancellor Schröder blundered in like a bull in a china shop, having no expert knowledge of this process.	0.7244582358190981
Mind you, even the Resolution of the Finnish Council Presidency in June was not the best result that could have been done achieved.	0.9339119988561838
There are certain weaknesses, the greatest of which, in my opinion, is that not enough consideration is being given to the situation of small businesses; after all, the car industry is more than just large companies.	1.0725605573379844
It is in the area of supply that small business plays an important role and we must not fail to also take account of the interests of those employed in small and medium-sized enterprises.	0.8305257119899393
For there are considerably more than two million people employed in this sector.	0.579369017156842
The plight of small businesses is also addressed by numerous amendments from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and also the amendments in question from our group to Article 5 concerning costs.	0.6746502038274766
The common position is also no great shakes from an environmental viewpoint.	0.6535798359842546
It fails to take in the bigger picture and when my fellow delegate from the Greens says that this is the first time that the European Parliament has toned down a common position, I really must object, because quite simply, it is not environmentally meaningful to restrict the use of modern, low-consumption cars such as the 3-litre car, which contain a great deal of plastic, by means of rigid, high recycling quotas!	0.895955011883144
Consequently, we must support an amendment which at least permits exceptions in the case of particularly economical cars.	0.8030865064574689
The objections of the industry in this matter are certainly not without foundation.	0.9142192861680736
However, the arguments of the plastics and car industries would be more persuasive if a commitment were to be given to reducing CO2 levels in Europe in other sectors besides these.	0.8265467054825517
Mr President, we are indeed now in a very rare situation: those who wish to uphold environmental values will take the side of the Council in their common position.	1.0007867241934385
In contrast to what the previous speaker said, I can say I am really proud that a common position was achieved during the Finnish Presidency to uphold environmental values.	0.9275680594982424
If we slide away from the common position and try to divide the recycling costs, we will be creating a loophole: we will not have created a rational, clear system in which the division of responsibilities is in order.	0.9464406137255365
That is why, in my opinion, the manufacturer must take the greatest share of the responsibility.	0.9016156829505252
Only then will we find an adequate solution to the problem, taking into consideration the fact too that the manufacturer should be encouraged to make vehicles whose parts can be recycled at the smallest possible cost in the future.	0.6676881000713442
Mr President, there are two issues of principle in the Council' s draft directive.	0.9677599294523359
The first concerns the manufacturer' s unrestricted liability to take back end-of-life vehicles.	0.43751603959850877
There is the risk of creating a monopoly within the car dismantling trade.	0.7430488174194133
This particularly applies in areas within the EU where distances are great and where a lot of small companies are involved in dismantling vehicles.	0.5835262847403041
I believe that, quite apart from the nature of the issue concerned, the EU' s directives should not treat small companies within the Union unfairly.	0.8540838592076672
Unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers would also be in danger of creating a situation in which the market for used car parts disappears, for manufacturers would have a greater responsibility to sell new parts.	0.799104627744737
Yet the trade in used car parts is important, especially for those who collect and renovate older vehicles.	0.6914657560961583
The principle of unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers is also dubious in terms of the principles governing the market economy.	0.6360764199629632
It should be possible for changes to be made to companies and for the latter to be sold and wound up.	0.9455501550304295
They should be able to establish themselves in new markets, but also to leave old markets.	0.8214884514365856
To bind manufacturers by means of a liability which can extend very far back in time ill accords with a flexible market economy designed to promote development.	0.5377185213712873
The second principle in the Council' s common position is the retroactive element in the draft directive.	0.8346358033079591
It conflicts with established economic and legal principles retroactively to impose upon a manufacturer financial liability for its product.	0.4112340738503969
To do so also changes the owner' s liability retroactively.	0.6585335653298116
Over the years, a consumer may have altered the product in a number of ways.	0.6089110964406159
Every country within the EU now has rules governing the scrapping of cars.	0.5219542674253332
Some may be better than others, and some worse.	0.838640597275704
In anticipation of this EU directive' s being implemented, EU countries ought however to be individually liable for scrapping vehicles in the best way possible so that the retroactive element in the EU legislation is not applied.	0.7263628826873347
This does not conflict with a financing model involving the building up of funds.	0.44013146056387337
Mr President, everyone agrees with the obvious environmental and industrial importance of the instrument in question.	0.7037029764013415
The common position offers an acceptable compromise but its rather delicate and precarious nature somewhat restricts the opportunities for improvement, and puts the whole directive at risk.	0.587936604712614
I therefore maintain that Parliament cannot force the issue and it would be paradoxical for it to do so in the context of redefining the environmental scope of the instrument.	0.7420505269444587
I would remind you that car manufacturers have admitted that they can live with the directive; the costs are not excessive: recycling a car costs less than 1% of the price of a new car.	0.7852698232056922
Moreover, the manufacturers will not be financially accountable until 2006, when a good number of the existing vehicles will no longer be on the market.	0.9466471670227316
As for the remaining vehicles, we could nevertheless provide for some means of sharing costs, as is proposed in Amendments Nos 44 and 45 by Mr Lange, the only ones that seem compatible with the balancing of the common position and with the trials underway in some countries, and we should therefore support them.	1.0242377763900183
Mr President, this is an extremely bad directive.	1.0671151626169937
First of all, as my colleague Mr Bowis has pointed out, it is retrospective and that is wrong in principle.	0.8442645234525422
Secondly, it dumps huge costs on the European motor industry which would damage competitiveness and damage employment.	0.7933046291826873
In this Parliament we constantly talk about the need to promote employment and jobs in Europe and yet we constantly pass measures which will have the effect of reducing employment.	1.0240076302099286
I suggest to you that the directive is bad in another respect, which has not been examined well enough in this debate. It is like so much European legislation.	1.0219745357466417
It is far too prescriptive.	0.5207999184349937
It sets in stone one particular model of recycling.	0.31815881864226475
The production line was invented about a hundred years ago, I believe, by Henry Ford and what we are proposing to do here is to create a sort of nineteenth century production line in reverse - to dismantle vehicles, to take the pieces apart and seek to recycle them.	0.8751295212171628
One thing we should stop and think about is the fact that there is a very uncertain market for recycled plastic bumpers of cars.	0.7232940504988867
The plastics industry for the most part does not want to take these things back and cannot economically do so.	0.6825724679664861
There is already a very successful industry out there which is shredding cars, recovering metals and recovering energy by the incineration of the non-metallic parts.	0.4504682806622266
This is a very environmentally reasonable approach.	0.8314301301081376
It is just as good environmentally to burn old plastic as to burn new oil for energy recovery.	0.45744194244838354
This method of disposal of cars carries no cost and so would eliminate the whole issue of who pays because the "dead" car would actually have a small value going into the recycling and reclamation process.	0.511000381578209
I would oppose this directive on the basis that it is too prescriptive, it ignores what is actually going on in the car recycling market at the moment and it sets in stone methods which are not necessarily the best environmentally, and are certainly very damaging economically.	1.0238792141033122
Mr President, the common position is sound, but it is up to Parliament to improve the common position on end-of-life vehicles.	0.9357253284869984
The Social-Democratic Group has submitted a few important proposals for improvement over the past couple of days.	0.4689120673422079
I would especially draw your attention to Amendment No 45, in which a choice is made in favour of laying the cost of disassembly and recycling at the door of the manufacturer, for new cars at any rate.	0.8482195765486803
Consequently, consideration will also be given to recycling during the conception phase and production.	0.7294944192369179
For the cars currently on the road, it would be reasonable to share the cost, for example by setting up a fund such as that in the Netherlands.	0.9306760387088199
The common position stipulates that manufacturers should not only bear the cost, they should also take back end-of-life vehicles.	0.8200424828505413
This is a big problem in my opinion.	1.0533240364864485
I urge that car manufacturers should most definitely not be given the task of organising the dismantling and recycling of vehicles, as they would gain an excessive hold over the second-hand components market.	0.770880329745137
They would then determine their own prices.	0.33566520371020053
Anyone who has been in an old car knows that this is to the detriment of the consumer and the amateur mechanic.	0.9340413826911123
The European consumer organisation, which has asked us to support the common position on this point, is to my mind letting the consumer down.	1.0462603301645919
A second argument for keeping the dismantling of cars out of the manufacturers' clutches is the cost of transport.	0.5663120293038044
If car manufacturers all set up their own dismantling companies, this will necessitate transporting end-of-life vehicles over long distances.	0.6125216209293523
This is environmentally unfriendly but also expensive and does not benefit the consumer either.	0.43316917623224876
I would therefore appreciate your support for Amendment No 45.	0.6857755494177741
Mr President, Commissioner, I have asked to speak again so that I can say a few more words at the close of this debate.	0.9532948806768057
If you travel to the Netherlands, you will find that every last owner can get rid of his car cost-free.	0.6170036999601861
You will also find that these cars are suitably disposed of, that new material flows have been opened up in order to recycle materials, that 85% of the weight of a car is recycled and that 92% of all cars in the Netherlands are recycled.	0.8125695470612996
This is financed by a fund to which the buyer of a new car contributes.	0.7758649035629622
Should this be condemned ecologically, Frau Breyer?	0.37642922186519245
I do not think so.	0.628295405983
The Netherlands has an exemplary model for disposing of cars as per the wishes of the directive and the issue of whether the buyer of a new car should pay or, in the case of end-of-life vehicles currently driving around, the manufacturer, has nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with ecology; it is a simple question of competition!	0.8747178206637706
The issue here is whether a European manufacturer should pay EUR 250 million or a Korean manufacturer, say, EUR 2 million.	0.5514989188194327
In terms of the people who build cars here in Europe, I am in favour of not making competition unequal but, in terms of environmental protection, I want freedom from costs for the last owner, to be financed by a special fund, and manufacturer responsibility for new cars, which will force them to assume responsibility for building recyclable cars!	1.0078613726274
(Applause from the PSE Group)	0.21280351447521983
Mr President, the proposal we are discussing has a huge amount of advantages, mainly in the interests of preventing waste and encouraging re-use, the recovery and recycling of components and the recovery of materials, etc. I think we have tabled a sound proposal.	0.9053610802688251
The main thread of the discussion is about whether or not the manufacturer, the vendor, or whoever, should take the end-of-life vehicle back without any cost.	0.8212457347963327
I will only give the example of my own country to illustrate how this system functions there without any problems.	0.6855601566248085
We have reached an agreement with all the parties involved.	1.005931237790852
These include car manufacturers, second-hand car dealers, the federation of the car industry, the metal processing firms, shredding firms and the government.	0.6566504538640824
An environmental policy agreement has been signed on a voluntary basis.	0.44754553939722613
The car industry - and Belgium produces a great many cars- did not have any problem with that.	0.8405644400424138
Belgians can deliver their cars back to the vendor without any cost.	0.39669045116805746
In connection with this, we have noticed how - quite contrary to what has been said here to the effect that the scheme would be to the detriment of employment - a number of small businesses have taken the recycling of materials to heart and are doing very well.	0.9346291275353107
Some businesses have become hi-tech businesses, because they managed to recycle certain materials, even materials which are not yet included in the directive.	0.8618327619268148
So this means that we are developing a new sector and new employment and doing the environment a huge favour into the bargain.	0.6704287664985135
I am in favour of collection free of charge.	0.3313539720615597
It worked for us.	0.14847465484376804
Why would it not work elsewhere?	0.4043888557258487
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for an interesting debate in which many important arguments have been presented.	0.6226066921484538
Would you be so kind as to bear with me for a few minutes.	0.5099608823777512
Allow me briefly to comment on some of the assumptions and principles behind the present directive.	0.5742697696688744
Allow me also to begin by commenting on and responding to a couple of the most important arguments in this debate.	0.7480157509580707
First of all, I think I should repeat some of the basic facts which Mr Florenz and others have already mentioned.	0.9477335425860787
What we are discussing here is the fact that close on ten million cars are scrapped every year in the European Union, resulting in approximately as many millions of tons of waste.	0.6852560649558895
This means that almost ten million tons of waste are created by these cars, and approximately seven per cent of the latter are abandoned out in the open.	0.6992418859956505
Moreover, they constitute environmentally hazardous substances of the worst kind.	0.7552687272555793
Approximately ten per cent of lead production is to be found in cars, but also cadmium, chromium, mercury and other very dangerous substances.	0.7506120117784099
This is something you already know, but I would nonetheless also repeat it for the benefit of those who are listening.	1.0201418451054247
Cars are one of the fastest growing sources of waste we have in Europe.	0.5891820397384419
We know that waste from cars exists and we know how we ought to be dealing with it, and there is no excuse for not taking action.	0.8103206898523043
The present directive has three aims. First of all, we want to stop heavy metals from being used in the manufacture of new cars.	0.7442272676004708
Secondly, we want to establish the fact that the manufacturer is liable.	1.1040499953381797
We can no longer take care of these matters at the end of a product' s life-cycle. Instead, we should avoid creating so much waste.	0.7370512321061009
We should see to it that we recycle as much as possible of the various contents of a product.	0.6865164064570066
Thirdly, we wish to achieve the recycling objectives specified in the present directive.	1.0397671757516658
These are the three most important aims of the directive.	0.7770010190798124
This is, of course, because it is a waste of resources for us not to ensure that materials in cars are recycled.	0.7825141670815857
It is, above all, the manufacturer' s resources we are wasting if we do not get to grips with a car' s life-cycle.	0.6112543231345129
Two important questions have arisen in this regard. Yes, there are in fact more than two questions, but I want to mention just two of the most important.	1.0188028527816182
First of all: who should pay?	0.755415749868549
And secondly: are we reducing the European car industry' s competitiveness by means of the present proposal?	0.7672743566965898
The first question, then, is about who should pay.	0.8318381407648422
The directive states that the polluter should pay and that the cost is to be borne mainly by the manufacturer in accordance with the principles to be found in the EU' s treaty concerning the manufacturer' s liability.	0.8219895536870168
It is nonetheless clear that the cost will be borne jointly by manufacturers and consumers.	0.7831685437689893
We have calculated that the cost of recycling cars does not constitute more than one per cent of the price of a new car.	0.7819419388254834
Do we imagine, then, that the cost would disappear if we were not to adopt this directive?	0.9631487657430973
No. Clearly, we shall all have to bear the cost of serious damage to the environment, but it will be very much greater.	1.1650227365415238
Moreover, the cost will have to be borne in the future.	1.121776470100626
The cost will not therefore disappear, but now we are clarifying whose liability it is and how the cost is to be distributed.	0.8592984324388268
Are we therefore talking about a car industry in crisis?	0.5352478755927355
Is it an unprofitable industry which we are discussing and which we really have to help by not imposing more taxes upon it?	0.7417339319217432
Is it the case that the car industry definitely cannot afford these?	0.6120129959183865
Is it the case that the motives behind the proposed measures are in actual fact concerned with reducing the competitiveness of the European car industry?	0.7629193093367775
No, of course not.	0.8763526852430352
It is quite the opposite.	0.7649450078996088
Do you believe that consumer demand for environmentally friendly cars and more fuel-efficient cars is going to decline in the future?	0.5580228986171154
What kind of requirements do you think our children and grandchildren and future legislators are going to make of cars?	0.5607927242636817
Naturally, that they should be environmentally friendly, that they should be recyclable, that they should be fuel-efficient and that they should not pollute our environment.	1.0578312075597252
It is, of course, only in this way that we can create a future for the car industry.	0.9059602650766031
We must create forms of motive power which are not damaging to health and which are of such a kind that we can deal with the relevant waste, recycle materials and compete by means of environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient cars.	0.7762149898508957
The fact that we have a European car industry which has already made great strides more than properly compensates for the fact that there are, in fact, a good many cars on European roads for which they must take responsibility.	0.9454943817109585
The cost is not insurmountable; nor is the task an impossible one.	0.6114432038951604
If we develop motive power of the kind I have described, I am quite certain that market forces and commercial interests in the car industry will ensure that mechanisms develop for dealing with both the cost and the workload.	0.7760349900753784
These will consist of everything from insurance to sensible and effective scrapping and recycling systems.	0.32884487990712413
The industry itself will ensure that these systems are introduced in Europe.	0.5685393481319871
They will not represent an insurmountable cost for the European car industry.	0.7352284482087309
They will instead help industry to be in the vanguard of eventually producing environmentally friendly and more fuel-efficient cars.	0.5490068714580001
We must do this for the sake of the environment.	0.807860229470251
The costs will not disappear. Nor will the waste disappear.	0.52131623872842
But, otherwise, we must all of us, as taxpayers or citizens, foot the bill. What is more, the costs will be higher the longer we wait before taking action.	0.8610414610851829
That is what I should like to say by way of introduction.	0.8952721191389569
I also want to comment on the question as to whether there is to be any retroactive legislation.	0.896117810269403
If we assume that, on average, a car has a life of eleven years, do Members, indeed does anyone, believe that we should wait for eleven years before we get to grips with this problem?	0.8156936285723491
Do you think that, when we legislate about chemicals, we should say that we are ignoring those chemicals which are already on the market and that we are legislating only for what is to be produced in the future?	1.0967304920446836
Clearly, we must consider the problem which exists here and now and the challenge presented by the existing range of cars.	0.9235007790756796
It is still not an insurmountable problem.	0.710804912620134
We can deal with it.	0.22352095519919968
We already have an infrastructure.	0.45882431885843045
We have what we require in order to deal with end-of-life cars.	0.568610654387797
I naturally hope that the result of today' s vote will be a good one.	0.9229892229180179
If I have not already done so, I would also thank Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz for the hard work he has put into this proposal on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.	0.8034229963740378
In fact, it is in many respects pioneering work when it comes to re-use and manufacturer' s liability.	0.7446212966992297
I believe it will have very positive and noticeable effects on the environment.	0.8936273453921283
We cannot continue to close our eyes to these matters.	0.5881023236609688
As I have said, we have both the knowledge and the resources to cope with these issues.	0.8414420828382505
After the first reading in the European Parliament in 1999, the Commission' s proposal ended up in an awkward political situation in the Council.	1.0713984432290986
However, we obtained a well-balanced common position in July during the Finnish Presidency.	0.8353312378527453
Now, we must ensure that the present legislative process is concluded successfully.	0.9487291898421363
A total of 48 amendments have been tabled.	0.6775043141294018
The Commission can adopt 10 amendments in their entirety.	0.7224850833302335
Three amendments can be partially approved, and one can be approved in principle.	0.7774205027042929
Certain amendments concern improvements to the Commission' s proposal which we adopted as early as at the first reading or else they reintroduce into the directive such parts of the original proposal as the Council has removed.	0.8461361542035004
This applies to Amendment No 5, excluding section 1; 8 and 9, section 1; 10 and 12, section 3; 15, 16, 20, 22, 24 and 25.	0.5656547772670747
These amendments can all be approved.	0.4182107118138784
Amendments Nos 6 and 21 are new; the Commission can approve these.	0.9201507220249756
The Commission can also approve Amendment No 26 with certain editorial changes.	0.6203500076513718
I want to emphasise that a number of the other amendments affecting the proposal' s basic components involve a considerable watering-down of the level of environmental protection aimed at by the common position.	0.679757040115551
They cannot therefore be approved.	0.3651730721066879
Parliament has traditionally made a major contribution to strengthening environmental legislation in Europe.	0.464368612589716
It would amaze and depress me if it were not to do so today.	0.7285699827885092
I am very concerned about certain amendments from Parliament which bring the absolutely basic pillars of the present proposal into question.	0.7804862581413107
These concern, for example, the phasing-out of heavy metals, manufacturer' s liability and the requirement for recycling.	0.6358275149190199
I want to deal with these amendments on a group-by-group basis.	0.6417807853670047
Amendments Nos 4, 11, 12, 13, 28, 30, 32, 37, 42 and 48 concern the phasing-out of heavy metals.	0.4357700625717791
Amendment No 12 involves a delay of at least ten years in bringing the provision into force.	0.5905656077370351
Amendments Nos 13, 28, 32, 37, 42 and 48 involve introducing unnecessary conditions and exceptions.	0.34808249234085764
This would mean that the process of replacing dangerous substances would be implemented more slowly.	0.6431915693189565
Amendments Nos 4, 11 and 30 mean that heavy metals have to be separated from the waste before recycling.	0.6606759351959492
The Commission considers that the type of phasing-out proposed in the common position is easier to apply from a technical point of view.	0.6738701248611485
Amendments Nos 17, 18, 27, 34, 36, 38, 44 and 45 relate to the manufacturer' s liability.	0.46514869260980857
The compromise reached by the Council is fair but fragile.	0.8507840418352628
The Commission does not consider that the amendments would improve the balance without, at the same time, creating tensions.	0.6537110357165641
I regret the confusion which arose recently due to internal documents from the Commission being wrongly used, so creating uncertainty about the Commission' s attitude to the issue.	0.7605398516148663
I want to emphasise that, as early as 1997, the Commission proposed a special clause concerning manufacturer' s liability and that the Commission entirely supports the common position.	1.0767817119141831
This does not impose disproportionate costs upon manufacturers. Far from it.	0.39777981907808563
Amendments Nos 39, 40, 46 and 47 concern quantified objectives.	0.3902990814921015
The high level of protection aimed at by the common position would be very much undermined if the recycling objective for the year 2006 were removed.	0.8105677704168485
These amendments would also make the objectives awkward to deal with and difficult to supervise.	0.5326638659390429
Allow me also - listen carefully to what I am saying now, because I have heard this reiterated in the debate - allow me to comment on the issue of vintage and "cherished" cars as mentioned in Amendments Nos 3, 7, and 9, section 2, and 35.	0.904005592147109
Such vehicles are not covered by the definition of waste and are not therefore included under the directive.	0.5822816127085378
So, whatever has been stated in this regard, vintage cars and motorcycles are not included under the directive.	0.5698572777602695
We do not consider that Amendments Nos 2 and 14 add anything to the directive.	0.7420774569005449
Amendment No 23 involves the Commission' s having to adopt quality standards for reusable components.	0.42106783299489847
This is not covered by the directive.	0.847485202359281
An ad hoc directive should therefore be demanded from the European Parliament and the Council.	0.8285190113978497
Amendments Nos 29, 31 and 41 water down the requirements concerning the dismantling of vehicles.	0.5281891488587898
There is a danger of Amendments Nos 31 and 41 reducing the chances of recycling plastic, tyres and glass.	0.5843848638638771
Finally, the Commission cannot approve Amendments Nos 1 and 33 for reasons to do with legal clarity; nor Amendment No 19, which the Commission considers to be unnecessary at this stage.	0.9986734908156399
Furthermore, Amendment No 43 does not fall within the directive' s area of applicability.	0.577821959160196
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	0.4387655520009009
The debate is closed.	0.04146649521247962
We shall now proceed to the vote.	0.17833711581859787
Vote	-0.0
Madam President, as you know, the reason we are voting this report today rather than last week is because of the numerous and serious translation errors, particularly in the French version.	0.8393045946529515
You have received a letter of complaint from me about the number of mistakes in this report and in other reports with which I have had dealings recently.	0.8789522871922049
There is an error which has still not been corrected and that is on Amendment No 4.	0.8465772435889614
In the English version we refer to pharmaceutical and scientific organisations.	0.4375497300619093
In the French version that becomes 'entreprises pharmaceutiques et organisations scientifiques' .	0.34080124387509636
Could you please make sure that French-speaking Members of this House know that the word entreprises is not correct.	0.6957032742110898
It should not be in the amendment.	0.9320294090796957
And, again, I urge you, Madam President, to look at the standard of translation that we are receiving currently.	0.9939173328788161
Madame McNally, in general, I am myself rather concerned at the increasing number of problems we are having with the translations.	0.8587379238212359
I shall consult the parliamentary services to see how we can find a solution.	0.6748785485036549

McNally Report (A5-0082/1999)	0.22889075686101065
- (FR) I am pleased to see the excellent report on the communication from the Commission entitled 'Women and Science' .	0.8163980729065949
In this document, the Commission proposes to stimulate debate with a view to promoting the increased participation of women in research in Europe.	0.813826120767871
This objective deserves our total support.	0.2869558337600201
Expenditure on research and technology actually forms a sizeable part of the budget of the European Union, after agriculture and the Structural Funds.	0.724373540061886
The various framework programmes have enabled not only high quality scientific work to take place but also innovative cooperation between researchers in various Member States.	0.47801410101515807
Relatively few women, however, are active in scientific disciplines despite the excellent results they achieve in their studies.	0.5640775002757694
It is unacceptable for women to continue to be underrepresented.	0.8045418706430474
I am therefore delighted to see the proposals of the European Commission.	1.0972074847334723
The Commission document sets out to focus on the initiatives to be taken at Community level, especially through the fifth framework programme for research and technical development, which is quite obviously something I approve of.	0.8578784449525383
The goal for the years to come is to increase women' s participation to achieve a rate of 40% female participation in the Marie Curie grants, in consultative assemblies and in evaluation panels for the whole of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development.	0.6690009059400398
In order to do so, it will be necessary to improve discussion and the sharing of experience among the various Member States, to set up a coordinating body to implement a 'Women and Science' monitoring system within the fifth framework programme for research and technical development, specially responsible for gathering and disseminating statistics collected in the implementation of the framework programme for research and technical development regarding the rate of women' s participation in research activities.	0.7109073406329092
Furthermore, like the rapporteur, I think that studies must be undertaken to analyse the reasons for the gap between the number of women with science degrees and the number of women who manage to have a career in these fields.	0.8621466534517019
Improved analysis of the obstacles facing women will make it possible to develop a strategy to eliminate those obstacles.	0.5604353573766885
We will have to enlist the support of the many existing networks of women scientists and to obtain their assistance in framing a joint research policy.	0.6287073469809707
The European Parliament will continue to carefully monitor the implementation of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development as regards the promotion of women and to come up with ideas for the course of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development.	0.7081793722267292
We must incorporate the gender factor in science, research and all other European Union policies, in order to put an end to the structural discrimination which prevents women competing on equal terms in the labour market.	0.6318737052941065
In its communication "Women and Science" , the European Commission informs us of its good intentions of enlisting the support of women to enrich research in Europe.	0.8075390966968446
This is very good, and we are pleased to see it.	1.4256476917522942
The fact is there are too few women involved in research work in the European Union.	0.7265357902525914
We know that we can change this situation, in which women are underrepresented in the science sector, only by means of a policy of educational guidance which will systematically encourage a greater range of career choices for girls and, when they have obtained their degrees, by means of positive measures at the professional level.	0.875712573788033
Having said this, some of our fellow Members clearly have qualms because the report by the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities which we have voted on contains one point which may lead to confusion and is interpreted by some as a quota stipulating that there must be 40% female participating in research in Europe.	0.7074456830335377
This is patently not the case, since such a quota would not be realistic.	0.7548984280433977
Indeed the report does not mention the time limit for this quota to be achieved.	0.5868291816030397
To set my fellow Members' minds at ease and to reassure them, I have tabled an amendment to the resolution in which we simply take note of the fact that the Commission, in its communication, undertakes to make significant efforts to increase women' s participation in Community research programmes, which is, after all, a praiseworthy goal.	0.8976394954344517
And why should we not note that the Commission' s communication stipulates specifically that it considers a 40% minimum level to be a crucial goal for women' s participation at all levels in the implementation and management of research programmes?	0.9385617660826108
It is not a quota!	0.9863154263768342
It is a perfectly legitimate declaration of intent from the Commission, insofar as it concerns its own programmes and not those of Member States.	0.6455473518803414
The latter would be well advised, however, to follow the good example of the Commission, for once, and make the same efforts in their own research programmes.	0.9771075874804322
People must realise this!	0.22230180238959524
I am pleased to see that the debate on Mrs McNally' s report with a view to increasing and facilitating women' s participation in professions in research and science, met with a fairly wide consensus.	0.7327792856538412
On this subject, any improvement in bringing the concept of equal opportunities to bear in everyday reality is indeed desirable, and I can only welcome the implementation of a policy which would contribute towards satisfying the legitimate aspirations of women: to enjoy equal access to scientific study, to obtain positions of responsibility truly in line with their results and competence, and to have accompanying measures drawn up rapidly, enabling them to reconcile their family life and their career.	0.8590492188689226
This necessary realistic and pragmatic policy, however, which will have to be associated with the elimination of the practical obstacles identified as unquestionable factors in this inequality must, as far as we are concerned, necessarily be based on the idea of complementarity, which is the only one capable of justifying a proactive policy on the subject.	0.8908738559634659
Our thinking and our future actions must focus on respecting these values, which truly respect gender differences, not on some postulated sexual equality, which has its own intrinsic contradictions. In any event there are no grounds for resorting to the easy option of a quantitative policy, based on the use of quotas, contrary to the idea of citizenship which the Members of Parliament in the UEN Group set great store by, and whose probable consequences would be the opposite of the effect apparently sought by Mrs McNally' s report, namely women' s participation in careers in science and research in proportion with their merit.	0.8205996999832986
By having the opportunity to show their true merit, by eliminating as far as possible the barriers associated to the specifics of their condition as women, and not in the context of a conflict in which women seem to be attacking male privilege, women will demonstrate the benefits to be gained by facilitating a situation where their professional careers may flourish. In this way they will succeed in altering balances which are still not in their favour.	0.8288057472164787
Since the European Parliament chose to vote on a text that expressly resorted to the quota policy which my report for an opinion had attempted to denounce in no uncertain terms, and in spite of the general approach which I approve for the most part, I can do no other than abstain from the vote on Mrs McNally' s report.	0.8827665173669956
Second reading of the Florenz report (A5-0006/2000)	0.33931480063765845
Madam President, today in the second reading we have voted on the amendments to the Directive on end-of-life vehicles.	0.9384671682533459
I have rejected the entire directive, not least because Amendment No 34 to Article 12 and the amendments to Article 5/4 have not received an adequate majority here in the House.	0.768008540517511
I come from a country which manufactures 50% of the cars in the EU and it is precisely the free collection of end-of-life cars which is so financially onerous and unacceptable.	0.9221548139159815
Here, in my opinion, the labour market is also considerably burdened by the costs arising to these companies.	0.7405656599797438
This cannot be a good thing in a European Union where we are ever mindful of employment.	0.9184845027254921
I consider that this is a serious defect and that, in principle, it does not befit our legal system.	0.9412849018838619
In my opinion, this directive is unacceptable for this reason.	1.0739712433600768
Madam President, I would like to comment on the Florenz report.	0.6269205508241871
I think that the vote has shown that although the common position of the Council has been toned down, the major groups here (and above all the German delegates of the major groups) have not, thank God, succeeded in destroying the heart of the directive, namely manufacturer responsibility.	1.0782653418815271
Unfortunately, there has been a toning down of the effective ecological material flow policy, i.e. through the obligatory risk assessment of materials whose harmful effect on health has been known for years.	0.656930956702185
We know that lead, mercury, cadmium and hexavalent chromium present high toxic and health risks and numerous Community directives have succeeded in restricting their usage without any risk assessment being made.	0.4550208340968629
Here, unfortunately, the European Parliament has bowed to the interests of industry.	0.818105613013812
I am nevertheless extremely pleased that there was no majority for the amendments of Florenz, Lange and others who have actually sought to lever out manufacturer responsibility and make consumers solely responsible for the cost of environmentally compatible disposal of end-of-life vehicles.	0.5144326532083139
I found this to be an extremely shameful attempt and I am pleased that it failed, that the attempt by one large government and the delegates of a large Member State did not gain a majority, by which I mean the attempt to dominate the voting process of the European Parliament on grounds of the interests of its national industries.	0.8424601000004662
Madam President, although I too have spent most of my life in fast cars, I agree with my colleague, Mr Florenz, that the directive on scrapping cars must make it clear that vintage cars are not included.	0.959691876796606
These splendid cars do not constitute waste.	0.24952601480533515
That is why I voted in favour of the amendments.	0.8471214717008168
Neither can we fix what the age for a vintage car should be as there are very great differences from one country' s statutes to another' s.	0.5508635024447658
In this way vehicles of historic value can be preserved for future generations.	0.5505398531600457
We cannot forget old car enthusiasts either, of whom there are more than 50 000 in Finland alone.	0.7649370454884654
They are involved in low-profile work of valuable cultural importance.	0.39391187213420553
- (SV) The parliamentary process concerning this question has been confusing, to say the least.	0.7629043165177495
Before the vote at the plenary sitting, new amendments have been tabled such as have already been voted down by the Committee.	0.9180450043120979
In the divided situation which has now arisen, we therefore consider that the Council' s wordings are the best.	0.8437913064957191
We need a directive in this area, and we also therefore want to avoid a complicated conciliation procedure.	0.9331165914874311
The directive concerning end-of-life vehicles will stand as an example for future legislation.	0.5944727121432295
It is therefore important that the manufacturer' s liability should be clear. This should not in any way be jeopardised.	1.0826307403795368
Today, Parliament is examining, for the last time, this text on 'end-of-life' vehicles and what is to be done with them: their destruction, a commendable intention with regard to our environment.	0.9937357212704816
There are, however, two considerations which must certainly be dealt with within this text.	0.5913393703045509
First of all, who is to bear the financial costs of this destruction?	0.8462671888712374
We must all ensure that it is not always the same person, i.e. the vehicle owner, who pays.	1.0161732396546053
He or she already pays enough in taxes for this vehicle, which is a bottomless pit in financial terms.	0.6299737700990892
We have recently had cause to talk about the 'polluter pays' principle. We should apply this principle rationally and calmly, correctly targeted and without ideology.	0.7587752756401476
Another essential point that must be included in this text is the express exclusion of vintage vehicles from its scope.	0.6471481407378109
One might make the claim that there is no need to state it explicitly in writing because it is an obvious point, but I feel that it is a point that should be made in writing because there is every interest in adopting clear texts.	1.0878453088732936
So let us vote for these amendments in order to preserve these gems of the automobile industry.	0.4966320212726172
These old vehicles are testimony to a culture and a passion which should be recognised and respected by Europe, if we are not to water down each of our specific identities.	0.784041055280262
There is no lack of examples amongst European texts, and we all know how much debate and argument is caused by a lack of clarity and precision.	0.8424721766769702
I only need to mention the case of Directives 79/409 and 92/43.	0.592616608718568
The precise wording of texts provides a guarantee and legal certainty for those people who will have to apply or live by these texts on a daily basis.	0.665759662280481
It is not the job of the MEP to generate litigation or legal proceedings for judges in any arena. That would not be fulfilling our mission.	0.7800030023171624
On the contrary, we must adopt crystal-clear texts in order to limit legal disputes.	0.6790081116157662
.	-0.0
(NL) That the Florenz report has caused such a stir has been proven by the powerful lobby machine which has been set in motion by both industry and the environmental movement.	0.7034673117904623
I regret that the manufacturers have harangued the European Parliament and the Council with a whole ream of arguments which either cut no ice or were simply false.	0.7249760829282014
I dare say this because I took the trouble to go into the field and collect information from, among others, scrapyards which already recycle car components successfully.	0.5638063740403776
They made it clear to me that the arguments concerning lack of safety, for example, are nonsense.	0.7675298213442207
The car lobby was unsuccessful today and I am pleased about that.	0.7864103659272601
The directive remains in place.	0.20904869232242898
I expect that we will achieve an excellent result in the reconciliation and that the efforts to achieve a better living environment will triumph over unreasonable industrial requirements.	0.8321824492570113
- My party opposed this measure and the proposed amendments.	0.6247135977362214
There are few things more certain in life than taxes, death and pollution.	0.4376522015993106
However, there is also nothing more certain than EU environmental directives which have laudable intentions but which actually fail to achieve their stated objectives.	0.6105701651413494
When it comes to pollution, like sin, we are all against it, but from there it is a far cry from believing that just because a measure is proposed against this evil it is necessarily good.	0.7750678524858806
In fact, this directive, like so many others addressing environmental issues, is not good.	1.0083039110804326
As is so often the case, it merely provides yet another massive bureaucratic structure to control a problem, which will only serve to create more jobs for officials, and cost the motor industries and consumers a great deal of money.	0.7945442661993091
The one thing it will not do is solve the problem - it is a massive sledgehammer to miss a nut.	0.8102233183520613
No one, not least my party, could begin to disagree that recycling should be encouraged, but the best way to achieve that is to work with the market, not to create another bureaucratic monstrosity.	1.0945401214416663
Thus, a more appropriate way to encourage recycling is to tax manufacturers who do not increase the amounts of recoverable material in their vehicles, to encourage private sector recycling companies, through a package of tax incentives and assistance on complying with environmental requirements, and to incentivise the use of recycled materials.	0.7829074344719275
Of course, these are areas where the EU does not have any jurisdiction and nor should it have such jurisdiction.	0.784865550896163
However, in the absence of these powers, it should not seek to substitute a less effective measure.	0.9378797921347151
Instead, it should leave Member States to develop their own systems, and avoid the tendency to interfere where it is not wanted and can do no good.	1.0490065256433958
Berger Report (A5-0007/2000)	0.16368335724385247
This proposal for a directive attempts to establish conditions for the posting of workers who are third-country nationals, for the provision of cross-border services.	0.7588607909658253
Third-country nationals with a permanent right of residence in one Member State do not enjoy the right to freedom of movement within the European Union.	0.6014522161446992
Until now, the restrictions on the freedom of movement within the Union of non-Community workers have been very harsh.	0.7867366215565599
It is therefore a positive step that the movement of workers within the European Union is being made easier, even when they are nationals of third countries.	1.0233009665510864
Nevertheless, the proposal for a directive merely aims to allow them to move to another Member State when they are posted there by an employer based in their country of normal residence. This means that their scope for movement is limited to the duration of their posting and only to the Member State to which they were posted.	0.885939286695585
This means that this proposal' s fundamental aim is not to resolve the problem of the restricted movement of these workers, but merely to improve the position of the companies providing services.	0.9316163508503504
On the other hand, for the sake of simplifying procedures some highly debatable amendments have been included in the Berger report, one example of which is the establishment of a common information service for cards issued by a body in any Member State.	0.8214538134087684
Berger Report (A5-0007/2000) and Berger Report (A5-0012/2000)	0.4328410425970249
It is with the greatest satisfaction that I welcome the two proposals for directives intended to facilitate the freedom of movement of workers who are nationals of a third country while facilitating the freedom of movement of services.	0.79117622754993
Basically, these proposals introduce the EU service provision card which will in future enable almost 5 million third country nationals legally resident in a European Union Member State to provide services in other Member States, a phenomenon currently obstructed by problems such as the need to obtain visas and work permits.	0.797612258052548
The first proposal for a directive will authorise businesses established in a Member State which employ workers who are third country nationals to assign such employees to another Member State on a temporary basis to provide services there.	0.7760082172675709
According to the terms of the directive, the employer would be simply required to request a service provision card for each employee concerned.	0.6869982530421963
Logically, in order to be given such a card, the employee must be legally resident in a Member States and must be covered by a social security scheme.	0.9820669263592406
The second proposal grants the same rights to self-employed workers who are third country nationals.	0.634005364971606
While, basically, I subscribe to the European Commission proposals, nonetheless there are some conditions which may lead to confusion.	0.9685457434528865
That is why I am voting in favour of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur.	0.9044353395971265
This will make it possible to clarify the terms and thus prevent any misreading!	0.6105084216208899
Other amendments are intended to simplify the administrative procedures, for example by authorising Member States to designate a single authority responsible for issuing cards.	0.7408007768061539
I feel an amendment of this type is essential to prevent the sort of administrative unwieldiness which too often acts as a brake on the proper application of new conditions.	0.695598797176138
I can, therefore, only be delighted at the adoption of these directives thus amended. We could not really tolerate much longer a situation in which people legally resident within the European Union had to face so many problems.	0.781761003666988
This goes against the fundamental principle of non-discrimination enshrined in the founding treaties of this Union.	0.5654330646352294
Marinho Report (A5-0003/2000):	0.36665760239141937
We have serious reservations about the Council' s proposed amendments.	0.45314188939862454
How can we talk of increasing the sphere of competence of the Court of First Instance when we know that we need to increase the number of judges in that Court because it is overstretched?	0.8369884332614204
The first measure would in fact cancel out the effects of the latter.	0.6367518189703265
Some people will say that perfection is not a realistic aim, but a brief look at the background should make our reservations more understandable to them:	0.7879103642832205
On 1 January 1995, the Council went back on the decision to increase the number of judges laid down in Article 17 of the Accession Treaty of 24 June 1994.	0.8785761580687734
In May 1995, during the preparatory phase of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the CFI, concerned about the persistent increase in the volume of cases, was already insisting on the need to take measures 'without which the Court would soon cease to be able to fully satisfy the principle of the proper administration of justice and to fulfil its assigned role ... in conditions likely to compromise the protection of parties subject to trial.'	0.8052905730804588
So what was done at Amsterdam?	0.3469315425289607
In that respect, nothing. On the contrary, extending the Community' s legal competence within the framework of the third pillar has increased the burden.	0.6842406888190132
You will agree, furthermore, that the texts adopted by this House always call for Community jurisdiction, and that includes for the Charter of Fundamental Rights which is currently being drawn up.	0.8670915299660696
The increase in the number of CFI judges from 15 to 21 and the opportunity it has recently been accorded to have a single judge rule on specific cases are not real solutions but mere decoys, grudgingly granted, which we have become aware of after the fact.	0.6165571312207212
Consequently, these proposals do not live up to the issues at stake. They represent a downward spiral which in the long term would require the number of judges to be increased to several hundred.	0.8930472209063347
We cannot agree to this, since such a sidelong shift towards a Europe of the Judges is detrimental to the proper exercise of democracy in our States.	0.698691426731476
The time has come, we feel, for in-depth consideration of how to put the Community system of jurisdiction in order and to guarantee a fitting quality of justice.	0.9584630875075035
This question cannot be dealt with separately from the current thinking on the hierarchy of norms and the better application of the principle of subsidiarity.	0.49873439323563723
Is the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference not the ideal opportunity for this?	0.42617229599042367
Dimitrakopoulos and Leinen Report (A5-0018/2000)	0.20155757824319398
- (SV) The most important task of the approaching Intergovernmental Conference is to reform the EU before the accession of the new Member States.	0.8009320773456146
We therefore, of course, support the European Parliament' s now giving the formal go-ahead to the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.4978855453432531
We nonetheless consider that the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference should be limited to questions which have to be resolved if it is to be possible for enlargement to take place.	0.8277574371007702
We also argued this in November 1999, and we would therefore refer to our explanation of vote of 18 November 1999.	0.7894842598168775
.	-0.0
(FR) In the opinion which it has just adopted on the convening of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, the European Parliament calls for a "constitutional process to be launched" .	0.8676772739873283
This determination to override nations with a legally supranational text is also expressed in the first meetings of the body responsible for drawing up the so-called Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is really a closet constitution.	0.7004135307763538
It is expressed again in the unbelievable excess perpetrated by the European Parliament which today in its vote on a resolution wished to cancel out the result of the free elections in Austria.	0.7521967323509161
The same determination to reduce nations to the level of mere administrative regions is also evident on every page of the opinion issued by the Commission for the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.7307620264760982
The key idea involves making qualified majority voting the general rule while modifying the content of this qualified majority to make it a double simple majority, of States and peoples, in order to increase the Commission' s room for manoeuvre and reduce that of the minority States.	0.7860689703506576
Incidentally, the French will probably be interested to learn that the Commission is asking for Article 67 of the Amsterdam Treaty to be amended in order to establish majority voting and codecision with the European Parliament.	0.8367213457884719
People will remember that this article, dealing with the transfer of immigration policy to the Community level, stipulated that for five years decisions would still be taken by unanimous vote in the Council and thereafter the Council would assess a potential opportunity to amend the system.	0.7956645023712411
In France, both in the National Assembly and in the Senate, when this was being ratified, many members of the French parliament were reassured to hear that, in any case, the Council would remain free to choose and could retain unanimous decision-making.	1.0245175711969436
Well, today, the same Minister of European Affairs who drew up the Treaty of Amsterdam, who has, in the meantime, become a European Commissioner, Mr Barnier, proposes to decide, at the forthcoming IGC, that the Council will operate in these areas by majority decision.	1.0181359882415273
This is the type of mechanism we are continually subjected to when playing the game of European integration with the Brussels institutions.	0.6183309359471718
The French must be made aware not only that the purpose of all these operations is to eliminate their country as a responsible centre for decision making, but that furthermore every means will be used to extract their consent.	0.7934880349769345
If they yield, they are lost.	0.5984796388019635
For it is their very means of defence which are being eliminated one by one.	0.6727647585894534
. (DA) The Danish Social Democrats have today voted against the report on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.6827877668919262
It is crucial for us that it should be possible for this Intergovernmental Conference to be concluded before the end of the year 2000 so that there are no remaining formalities, such as the weighting of votes in the Council of Ministers and the composition of the Commission and the European Parliament, which place obstacles in the way of the enlargement of the EU.	1.0030273292079124
We were therefore also very satisfied with the decisions which were taken on this issue at the Helsinki Summit in December.	0.8401068751608928
An unduly ambitious extension to the agenda at the present time would risk delaying the enlargement process.	0.592891410949844
That is something we do not want to see, and we have therefore voted against any such extension.	1.0931238442659197
We nonetheless very much agree with our colleagues that there is a need for transparency in connection with the Intergovernmental Conference so that people are clear as to how the work is proceeding.	0.7855150867075534
.	-0.0
(SV) We are pleased that a limited agenda has been established for the Intergovernmental Conference at the Helsinki Conference.	0.9160623968456268
Possible future Member States ought to be involved in, and have an influence upon, the shaping of the EU of the future.	0.9620039814332887
The elections to the European Parliament in 1999 showed perfectly clearly that the people of Europe do not fall in with the notion of an ever more federalist EU centred upon Brussels.	0.7629096733524761
With the convening of the forthcoming IGC, the process of European Union is topical once again.	1.020568945506308
Once again the discussion is going to be monopolised by the Heads of State and Government.	0.5907329959688766
In other words, fifteen people are going to have discussions and decide, behind closed doors, on the fate of more than 350 million individuals.	0.6291229510385061
It is therefore easy to understand the public' s lack of interest, given the construction of Europe which is going on behind their back and in areas which are not really of concern to them.	0.8676376653512481
In fact, one only need look at the agenda of the IGC: the institutions, enlargement and European defence.	0.8720016395764547
The fact is that the prime concerns are the strengthening of executive power, the development of closer relations with liberalism in the countries of Eastern Europe and the relaunch of the militarisation of Europe, particularly by increasing military budgets.	0.8346636818126083
Social Europe, used as a foil by the EU, has simply been eliminated from the agenda.	0.666080332954647
All this does is to legitimise the development, on the European scale, of resistance movements anxious to bring in a social charter which would harmonise workers' main claims towards the highest common denominator.	0.697088735783831
This is why I am voting against the report.	0.8846437569445772
I voted for the resolution to adopt an opinion is in favour of convening the IGC. I did so because it sums up the philosophy of the Portuguese Presidency, which is supported by a broad majority in Parliament, of opening up the IGC agenda beyond issues strictly related to redressing the balance of power between Member States, large and small, as was originally stated when the Helsinki Council was convened.	0.8662012298041961
Unfortunately, in the issues covered by the resolutions on future subjects for revisions to the Treaty on European Union, nothing has so far been stated about the need to review Article 7, which deals with suspending a State in the event of a serious and persistent violation of the "founding" principles of the Union, as laid down in Article 6.	0.8407324696832466
As the present crisis involving Austria has demonstrated, the Union has the right to protect itself.	0.9126183213714614
Nevertheless, the legal mechanisms that exist in the Treaty are weak, difficult to apply politically and legally, do not define the powers of the institutions and do not guarantee fair legal treatment for processes of major importance. Suspending a state is just such a process, and is to be condemned.	0.960625183932961
I therefore think that this issue should be included as a matter of urgency in the IGC agenda, and in itself this justifies a thorough revision of the Treaties.	0.9244150212127942
We feel that at present the central issues about convening an Intergovernmental Conference to amend the Treaties are far more important than the controversy taking place here about the size of the agenda. They are also more important than the controversy over the appropriateness or otherwise of formulating proposals for new issues to be covered, and more important than the controversy over the extent of Parliament' s participation in it.	0.8292391702825891
We feel that these issues result from the IGC' s appropriateness and its objectives, as well as from the matters which will inevitably be discussed there.	0.7371271022484417
We have doubts concerning the appropriateness of the IGC because we fear that the objectives actually being addressed may be far removed from the changes required to allow for the enlargement envisaged.	0.6497485243921837
This relates in particular to the intended agenda, particularly as regards the Amsterdam leftovers, which suggests that unacceptable inner cabinets will be created in the future. This also identifies areas relating to the second and third pillars, which tend to be reflected in an undesirable militarisation of the European Union.	0.9130629894010678
These are some of the basic reasons why we do not agree with the aims of the motion for a resolution now before us.	0.7844323593447708
- The European Parliamentary Labour Party has abstained on the final vote on the Leinen Dimitrakopoulos Report.	0.900043870962561
The text is overambitious, and Britain' s Labour MEPs believe that the IGC should primarily deal with the "Amsterdam left-overs" in order to prepare for enlargement, and not expand far beyond these.	0.8081484143508434
There is currently a great deal of work under way in terms of reform and this must be the priority for the moment to allow consolidation and strengthening of the EU institutions.	0.9090805159986466
Expansion of the agenda and drastic revision of the treaties would bring with it a risk of de-stabilisation.	0.7832766169369533
The key factor in this text as it has been amended, is the call for a Charter of Fundamental Rights to be incorporated into the treaties.	0.8885166786915266
In our view, this would bring with it a complex legislative burden, and it would be preferable to have a political and declaratory charter which explains to citizens what their existing rights are.	0.8836869452612622
Our priorities (i.e. the "left-overs" ) must be:	0.7113691598357194
the number and responsibilities of Commissioners	0.3780241106331288
weighting of votes in the Council	0.09140598807716126
extension of QMV in areas where it will benefit the UK and Europe (but not Treaty change, defence matters, border controls or taxation), and extension of codecision wherever QMV is extended	0.6021670836542984
Beyond this, we have concerns that the "flexibility" or enhanced cooperation suggestion is not appropriate at present.	0.6767359399992564
The provisions of Amsterdam are largely untested and allowing more scope for opt-outs could weaken the EU at the time when enlargement is being considered and applicant countries are being asked to sign up to single market and other European legislation.	0.6517556229378797
- (SV) In order to be able to influence developments, the European Parliament must adopt a more constructive attitude towards the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference than emerges from the present resolution, which displays far too much disappointment and negativity about the decision which the European Council made in Helsinki in December 1999.	0.869632032498988
The European Parliament and its Committee on Constitutional Affairs ought instead to have been more specific and concentrated on just a few points in addition to the Council decision in Helsinki, so stating what it considered to be the most pressing matters for discussion, including the question of establishing a public prosecutor to deal with crimes against the institutions of the European Union and their financial interests.	0.9797623500341461
We Swedish Christian Democrats also oppose any threats which have been made to delay the enlargement of the EU to the east if the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference is not extended very considerably to include subjects in addition to those left over from the Intergovernmental Conference in Amsterdam in 1997.	0.7614912123614042
The most important task of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference is to reform the EU before the accession of the new Member States.	0.7782517326252062
I therefore, of course, support the European Parliament' s now giving the formal go-ahead to the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.497918339217789
I nonetheless consider that the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference should be limited to questions which have to be resolved if it is to be possible for the enlargement to take place.	0.8701106310266256
I also refer to my explanation of vote of 18 November 1999 which clarifies my attitude towards supranationalism and common defence.	0.42201677200108656
Joint resolution on Austria	0.34678016561203406
Madam President, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group did not associate itself with the joint PPE/DE-PSE resolution on the political situation in Austria following the formation in that country of a coalition government between the conservatives and Jörg Haider' s Freedom Party.	0.6785452839449929
This PPE/DE-PSE resolution commends the initiative taken by fourteen Member States to apply pressure to Austria by organising a sort of diplomatic boycott.	0.4802085613744696
What we find most shocking is the fact that this joint intervention claims the authority of the Treaty, as if this stated somewhere that henceforth the free and democratic expression of a people could be cancelled by the will of the heads of government of neighbouring countries who in fact, in this instance, have carefully refrained from consulting their own peoples.	0.7947495684410526
Whatever Jörg Haider' s verbal excesses, which we of course deplore, the Austrians have made a democratic choice, and we must respect this.	1.0137586907871163
In our opinion, it is clear that the left wing in the European Parliament, in association with the Austrian left wing which was defeated in the electoral arena, have mounted a petty political campaign resorting to the memory of a sinister but fortunately bygone period.	0.6932620983173626
Although comparing Haider to Hitler is a concept without any credibility whatsoever, it has nonetheless partly achieved its purpose in unsettling some PPE/DE Members of Parliament.	0.5973155689724696
But, going beyond this petty political operation, what the majority in the European Parliament is afraid of most of all is that the threat to the left-right cohabitation in Austria, which caused political life to stagnate and rot, may soon spread to the European system of co-management which is producing equally appalling results.	0.8436289404909196
In order to prevent this threat to the system, it is ready to do anything, including overruling the outcome of free elections, including setting up a thought police, including establishing a new form of totalitarianism.	0.9516904146422939
Madam President, on behalf of the Members of Parliament who represent the Front national, the Vlaams Blok and the Movimento sociale italiano, I should like to ask the question: in this outrageous interference in internal Austrian affairs which the European Union has undertaken in contravention of general international law, in contravention of the Treaties, in contravention of morality, who is pulling the strings?	0.8817537876464542
Is this hysteria spontaneous?	0.1928266888204216
Is it the product of mere foolishness or, more probably, of a deliberate strategy, which is the same throughout the world?	1.0630802501704169
Who is imposing their will on the nations of Europe, daring to stop them choosing their own fate?	0.40447104079853413
Underground networks?	-0.0
The government of the United States, or of Israel?	1.021959725180861
Or their Socialist back-up troops who, in this House, have the cheek to thrust their values down our throats?	0.725654782547436
What, then, are the values of these Socialists who feathered their electoral nest in the last century by painting the idea of greater social justice in glowing colours for the benefit of the underprivileged, and who today are nothing more than the party of protected civil servants, full-time union officials and state capitalism?	0.7719171759978954
What are the values of the Belgian Socialist Party, which only goes from paedophilia scandals to corruption scandals, via Vandam and Agusta?	0.6754707864084316
What are the values of the French Socialist Party, which extorted money from all the town councils under its thumb in the Urba, Sages and Graco scandals?	0.6824515432855169
The party led by François Mitterrand, decorated with the emblem of Marshal Pétain' s Vichy government, the party whose leading lights have just been caught red-handed once again, living a life of luxury on the public funds embezzled from the students' mutual insurance company.	0.49017929390251797
I shall not even mention the instances of corruption in the Italian Socialist Party, because it does not do to kick a man when he is down, still less when he is dead and gone.	0.7841439899180487
I shall, however, mention the Spanish Socialist Party which has just formed an alliance with the butchers of Albacete and which settled its accounts with Basque nationalists by hiring contract killers.	0.48797284126455054
I shall also mention the German Socialist Party which dares to preach to us about the second world war, when it is international socialist in the way that its peers were National Socialists, still goose-stepping, the party of the Waffen SS...	0.7577524999804887
(The President cut the speaker off)	0.07650392215616267
Madam President, I had a major problem with this resolution.	1.0709655379838428
Finally, I abstained on the vote for a number of reasons.	0.9284252401691376
I was in sympathy with the EDD Group amendment, talking about rejecting the interference of the EU in the formation of governments of Members States but I had to abstain because it just followed on the condemnation of xenophobia, racism, etc. and I felt that it might be misinterpreted.	0.7769725386322823
However, I do wonder about the wisdom of this.	1.0118502987193778
Firstly, there is the question of trying to combat intolerance with intolerance and the long-term consequences of that.	0.7676633378516295
I also wonder about the wisdom of the EU and its reaction to the formation of the government in Austria and how that is going to affect public opinion there.	0.7800599261402184
At the moment it seems that the Haider Party is getting more support rather than less from the opposition by outside governments.	0.6329133338665155
Even America has now said that it is considering breaking off diplomatic relations.	0.5024982054023597
We wonder if this is actually feeding the flames of xenophobia and the parties and people that support it.	0.6707922533245941
I really think that people should be extremely cautious.	0.509029253393759
If you want to combat xenophobia and racism, and I believe that we should, we need to look at the root causes.	1.098643033021051
We need to look at the people who vote for these parties, and understand why this situation arises.	0.8781319340110235
It is not a situation that most people in this Parliament want, but we need to be careful about the approach we take, so that we do not in the end up with the opposite of what we are trying to achieve.	1.1463852942370318
Madam President, I strongly refute any statement, demonstration or feeling of xenophobia or racism.	0.5667104659996994
I passionately defend Europe' s heritage of human rights and the rule of law.	0.5446311834132629
I disagree, however, for this very reason, with the senseless actions taken by the Presidency - the Portuguese Presidency unfortunately - which have resulted in a real institutional blunder on behalf of the other fourteen States.	0.9593245096685333
This is not the way to fight extremism.	1.0288904558883496
It may even be a way of doing extremism a great deal of good.	0.7107965444072949
The torrent of confusion and rash actions that has been unleashed over Austria has blown things out of all proportion. It has caused considerable distress to decent citizens and evokes risks that had previously not even been considered.	0.5975286127010607
There is an irreconcilable contradiction between positions adopted in the name of human rights and the rule of law, but which at the same time attack the fundamental rights of the Austrians and ride roughshod over the basic tenets of the rule of law, in this case the standards laid down in the Treaties.	0.8841656166173776
What are we actually seeking to achieve in embarking on an Intergovernmental Conference?	0.5894552069307232
A Europe of 27 States or a Europe of 14, or even fewer?	0.8925508204644047
We support Europe, a Europe which does honour to all the actions that have brought us to this point, a Europe which respects the Treaties and the law and a Europe which needs Austria.	1.0625590354322447
This needs to be said!	0.6141233257099561
Madam President, I am delighted and proud that this Parliament has, by an enormous majority, condemned the formation of the coalition in Austria incorporating Mr Haider' s Freedom Party.	0.8447001928263694
Mr Haider has demonstrated, over the past years by both words and deeds, that he deserves to be excluded from normal democratic discourse.	0.8078161774110607
Not only has he admired Adolf Hitler, praised the Waffen SS, and refused to condemn a terrorist bombing that killed four Roma, but also in Carinthia has been a member of the regional government.	0.7720597252832248
He has led efforts to end provision for Austria' s Slovene-speaking minority and assistance to immigrants.	0.47207478283313886
Some have said it is not right for us to interfere in Austrian politics.	0.7812651036213687
They are wrong.	0.30666600198072913
European Union Treaties make it incumbent on us to protect fundamental rights.	0.4353641402156695
Some have said we have to accept the results of democratic elections.	0.9253130397961737
However, democratic elections do not make democrats of those who have threatened democracy.	0.8060767998768292
There is the tragic monument of the Holocaust, the death of 6 million Jews, to those who argued the same case with respect to Germany in the 1930s.	0.7844245967458955
However, we should not condemn Mr Haider for ambition.	1.009969786426747
Leopards do not change their spots.	0.3613023536329574
The real culprits are Austria' s Christian Democrat acting as Judas goats to resurrect a threat to Europe that we thought had died Berlin in 1945.	0.44412212715647476
Madam President, we have just passed a resolution which condemns the racist and xenophobic record of Jörg Haider' s Freedom Party in Austria, which has welcomed action by our governments to cut off political relations with any government of which he is part, and which sends our support to anti-racist groups within the democratic majority of the Austrian people.	0.9012814654200373
We warn that this coalition, if it is formed today, unacceptably legitimises the extreme right, directly in contradiction with the principles of peace and reconciliation, which bring us together in this European Union.	0.8366743641511578
These are the values which we ask of others who seek to join us.	0.8401644569364507
This European Parliament requires the European Commission to be vigilant of any racist action in Austria, and threatens to suspend Austria from membership of the European Union if this happens.	0.906219258562629
I am proud to support such a resolution.	0.3367848263158547
Though our proposal to withdraw political invitations to any Austrian government representative to this European Parliament has not carried today, I give notice that we will further this proposal to ensure that any action within the powers of this European Parliament to combat the return of neo-Nazis to government in Europe can and will be taken.	0.9205811248893498
I shall take the floor very briefly, Madam President.	0.6017052551737664
I respect Parliament' s wish, as it has been expressed, but I must also say that the self-determination of peoples cannot be called into question, even by the European Parliament.	1.1682732179261708
The document is unfair both to Austrian Members of the European Parliament, and to members of the Austrian national parliament, and it smacks slightly of jealousy and political interests, but also of business.	1.0722828862643925
I do not believe that these signals will change the citizens' indifference to Europe.	0.6933568652050277
The Austrian extreme right has been gifted an unwarranted present.	0.3463772323713381
I very much welcome the position taken by the Italian Radicals; and I say this while making a clear historic and material distinction between Italian liberals and Austrian liberals.	0.6868478396495001
I have for many years, in word and deed, been committed to the anti-fascist struggle and the struggles for equal rights and against xenophobia. However, recent events - firstly, what were really threats by the Council of Ministers, then Mr Prodi' s threats against the Austrian Commissioner and, finally, the present decision - are things I cannot support.	0.7989854753938154
I have not been able to vote in favour of the present decision even though I agree with many of its premises. What we have here, first and foremost, is an incredibly ominous mixture of power, arrogance and impotence on the part of the European Union.	0.849696382228738
Not only do these decisions conflict with the Treaty and apportion to the institutions of the Union more power than that to which they are entitled but, worst of all, their effect will be counter-productive.	0.8208523020558894
They will not weaken Mr Haider and the FPÖ. On the contrary, they will strengthen them.	0.8321232917731878
We shall obtain the very opposite of what we want.	0.8067932295191725
That is not how you combat racism and a swing to the right.	0.6455191218011173
. (DA) The Left' s Members of the European Parliament attach importance to the fact that, with today' s decision, Parliament has NOT supported the fourteen prime ministers' diplomatic sanctions against Austria.	0.8321708843791236
The Left' s Members of Parliament therefore supported the Liberal decision' s powerful rejection of any form of xenophobia in Austria or elsewhere.	0.572797365072553
We attach crucial importance to applying, if necessary, the new provisions under Article 7 of the Amsterdam Treaty so that a country which, by its actions, infringes fundamental citizens' rights by means of discrimination and such like will have its voting rights in the EU' s Council of Ministers removed.	0.8459764235366837
- (EL) The Freedom Party' s participation in the Austrian Government is a dangerous development for the European Union' s political future.	0.8811923228140799
It is a 'Trojan horse' which is unfortunately reappearing in Europe larger than ever since the Second World War.	0.6108531964639083
The European Parliament and the Union' s governments must politically isolate a government that includes admirers of Nazism and advocates of xenophobia.	0.621436626515767
The European Union bears a large measure of responsibility - and along with it the two dominant political movements, the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats - because, by their dogmatic adherence to the harsh financial policies of EMU, their dislocation of the welfare state and their deification of uncontrolled competition, they have pushed broad strata of society to the limits and made it possible for right-wing extremists of the Haider type to recruit support for their neo-Nazi ways.	0.7372748702796038
	-0.0
In view of the fact that the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament do not permit us to table our own resolution condemning Haider' s party, as well as all the parties throughout Europe which disseminate racist slander and which are xenophobic and hostile to immigrant workers, we voted in favour of the compromise resolution. We did so even though we did not agree with some of its recitals or terms, in order to show our solidarity with all those in Austria itself who are opposing the Austrian extreme right and its demagoguery.	0.8805523812057546
Our vote in no way constitutes an endorsement of the signatories to this compromise resolution, their present policy or their future attitude should the threat of the extreme right become more serious.	0.6089970026952813
Some of these parties, despite declaring themselves to be republican and democratic, adopt the demagoguery of the extreme right, either out of connivance or as a vote-winning ploy, if only in openly and hypocritically blaming the immigrant workers in our countries for unemployment, and generally making their lives more difficult.	0.735126446257495
More generally, those signatories who take part in or have taken part in government in the various States of the European Union must take their share of responsibility in the influence which the extreme right has managed to gain since their policy, devoted exclusively to the interests of big business, has not included taking action likely to eradicate unemployment and the poverty it engenders, and has thus facilitated the xenophobic demagoguery of the extreme right.	0.7611963647500675
This week we heard the first political cry of the new-born Europe.	0.6441248824173029
By staunchly and speedily denouncing the participation of Jörg Haider' s xenophobic and anti-European party in the Austrian government, a situation without precedent since the second world war, the European Union has come into its political birthright and has confirmed that it is not merely an economic and financial Community, a large market, a "Europe of shopkeepers" .	0.894575147358217
It is a part of its future which is at stake right now, part of its very essence, its heart and soul.	0.8919231619481457
The European Parliament was the first to speak up.	1.1718849314124455
The appeal by the European Socialists, on the initiative of Olivier Duhamel, raised awareness and enabled there to be a firm and immediate political response to this unheard of and intolerable situation.	0.6871802803137218
A firm attitude which the 14 European States have demonstrated unanimously and promptly, through Mr Guterres, by condemning the risk of the Austrian political situation getting out of control.	0.6962729025490921
This courageous stance turns a new page in the construction of Europe.	0.34929261860149147
A return to the roots, at last, for a Community built on the basis of the determination to turn our backs on a past history marred by hatred and exclusion and of adherence to the humanist values of openness and tolerance.	0.7211249985875854
Europe has managed to stand up to condemn unacceptable events.	0.5088122940308227
However, as it lacks the legal instruments to support this political will, since the sanctions stipulated under Article 7 of the Treaties are virtually impossible to apply, will it be able to keep its head high in the face of the threat of the systematic blocking of its entire institutional structure?	0.8713808650153637
The whole credibility of Europe is at stake today, before we invite the recent and still vulnerable democracies of the former eastern bloc to join us tomorrow.	0.7114367157285445
From now on Europe must put its words into action if it wishes to show the world the scope of its rediscovered ambition.	0.6159767807869982
At this time when we are voting on a joint resolution against the inclusion of neo-Nazis in the government of a European Union Member State, I must express my regrets regarding a compromise text which is particularly lacking in backbone.	0.9170775209219028
I am voting in favour of it because it is inconceivable that the European Parliament, after its excellent political debate yesterday, should not adopt a stance on this matter.	0.7822003984083473
Personally, however, I shall continue to fight against the extreme right, to urge people to sign a petition to demand measures which may go as far as the exclusion of Austria, and to organise a major public demonstration in Lille on Saturday at 3 p.m.	0.82340529736608
Fascism and neo-Nazism are cancers!	0.24892188124759784
The foul monster has been reawakened!	0.19390901347533096
For me there is no question of allowing them to develop and to flourish without fighting with all our might.	0.6434491479343476
Europe was born out of a desire for peace, freedom and tolerance.	0.5880332441312974
There is no question of it allowing xenophobic, racist and anti-Semitic ministers to be tolerated at within it.	0.46558806240261413
Do not count on me to keep quiet, without doing or saying anything.	0.5805400092711538
In yesterday' s debate in the European Parliament some Members of this Parliament expressed worry that we were interfering in the internal affairs of a Member State.	0.9801052495257663
Such a concern is misplaced.	0.3091731277676789
The European Parliament has never been slow to comment on developments in Member States with which they disagree.	0.9229350662933578
We have condemned Basque and Irish terrorism.	0.22476728010778796
We have opposed racism and the infringement of the rights of minorities.	0.4847141183867368
It is our responsibility as a parliament, particularly as the democratically elected voice of the European Union, to comment on current political developments in Austria which are in conflict with the policies of this parliament.	1.0164477704865325
By commenting and making our views known we are not preventing any party in Austria from forming a coalition government.	0.6126095985892727
We are nonetheless, as is our right as well as our responsibility, telling them that if they go ahead then there are consequences arising from such a decision and in fact we are warning them beforehand.	0.799870218995397
Others would argue that we should suspend judgement until we see the detail of such an agreement.	0.662213886482609
Such a view is not only a political cop-out, it is positively dangerous.	0.7634793116558728
In reaching an agreement with Jörg Haider and his party, the Austrian Christian Democrats would at a stroke be confirming political respectability on right wing extremism and also giving them access to power - both of which they will utilise as a launching pad for even greater electoral success.	0.6223813095828641
That is why the European Union must make its position clear regarding the current situation in Austria.	1.0403109329503684
- (SV) We have voted in favour of the common resolution in order to express our solidarity with all those who are exposed to xenophobia and racism.	0.8124539555245239
We have also voted in favour of the resolution in protest against the detestable politics that Jörg Haider stands for.	0.6241253227467194
We are nonetheless very critical of the methods which the 14 Member States have employed on this issue.	0.6621010498420542
The resolution makes no clear reference to respect for the Member States' national identities and constitutional traditions in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty.	0.7610446988613714
What is also missing is a paragraph concerning the EU' s shared responsibility for the social and political developments in Europe and Austria which have been among the prior conditions for Mr Haider' s electoral success.	0.6760413344961977
Today, as previously in the history of Europe, right-wing extremism is the result of insecure social and economic conditions of life.	0.8088480020144534
The policy of cut-backs which has followed in the wake of adjusting to EMU has promoted the successes of right-wing extremism.	0.4181714738542801
A radical policy to promote security and justice in each country is the best guarantee of democratic development in Europe.	0.844991973882922
- (DE) I am making this statement on behalf of the CSU.	0.7872120707860263
It is intolerable that the EU should involve itself in the formation of the government in a Member State.	0.7240307044960174
It has no right to do so.	0.5616279654289406
Instead of prematurely condemning the FPÖ and the Austrian Government which is being formed, there should first be a critical examination and assessment of the governmental declaration and the party programme and policies of the coalition.	0.7849996761322359
Only after such critical appraisal of the future policies of the parties involved in the coalition discussions can a decision be made as to whether this government is contrary to the democratic spirit of Europe.	0.8263668541830661
This does not mean that we sympathise with Haider.	0.5223360028978582
The CSU European delegates have no sympathy whatsoever with the leader of the FPÖ.	0.5581298904176083
However, as politicians we must ask the question why 27% of the Austrian population voted for a party such as the FPÖ at the elections in October 1999.	0.8308988976681535
We must concern ourselves with the reasons for this and try to deal with the reasons behind such results.	0.7490909884388637
Only by tackling the arguments and policies of the FPÖ can we prevent a radicalisation of Austrian politics.	0.4687022858996369
However, the resolution of the European Parliament does not question the reasons for the outcome of the Austrian vote and offers no options for resolving the problem.	0.9356278880772612
For these reasons the CSU European delegates are against this resolution.	0.42029678216669336
"He knew what those jubilant crowds did not know but could have learned from books: that the plague bacillus never dies or disappears for good; that it can lie dormant for years and years in furniture and linen-chests; that it bides its time in bedrooms, cellars, trunks, and bookshelves; and that perhaps the day would come when, for the bane and the enlightening of men, it would rouse up its rats again and send them forth to die in a happy city."	0.697562060961314
It is with these phrases that Albert Camus, at the close of the long allegorical novel describing the difficult fight of the citizens of the town of Oran against the plague, reminds us, at the close of the Second World War, that the fight against Nazism, "the brown plague" as it was termed at the time, could not enjoy a definitive victory.	0.7725984253050475
That because racial hatred, xenophobic violence, fear and rejection of what is different, have deep roots in all that is basest in humanity, they may re-emerge at any moment and take over any group of human beings.	0.6757373616478467
In this light, the events we are seeing in Austria must be seen as tragic.	0.6654701663338644
For the first time since the Second World War, a party which is openly pro-Nazi, racist and xenophobic has gained access to power in a European country.	0.6744716037564054
Confronted with this threat, which carries with it the negation of the very idea which lies at the heart of the construction of Europe, nothing must deter us: not the legal quibbling about what the treaty does or does not permit, not the legitimate questions about the right to intervene, not the derisory respect for formal democracy, and, above all, not the feeling of powerlessness which grips us in the face of an event which we reject with all the force of our convictions but which we are powerless to control.	0.8380434769349991
As the representative for a French overseas department, the island of Réunion, a land of racial and ethnic intermixing, where the population has been forged in the course of the last three centuries by the successive contributions of Europeans, blacks from Africa or Madagascar, enlisted men from India or Pakistan, or even Chinese, every day I experience the profound truth of the remark by Saint-Exupéry, "In being different to me, you are not doing me harm, brother, but enriching me!"	0.7134936990518419
This human diversity is our main sources of wealth, and this is the reason why it is my duty to track down and to condemn anything which may be harmful to it, wherever it may exist.	0.7611447682384176
For all these reasons I voted most decidedly in favour of the resolution before this House on the formation of the government in Austria.	0.8294437934342469
Jörg Haider' s rise to power, with the inauguration of a conservative right-wing and FPÖ coalition government, is a sign of the terrible revival in Europe of a monster to which liberalism has given birth.	0.6526542025840594
The success of the Austrian Freedom Party owes as much to the endorsement of respectability provided by the Austrian right wing and social democrats as to the policy of the latter, whose social disasters paved the way for extreme right-wing populism.	0.7774351333664749
The resolution stipulates possible diplomatic means to isolate the new government politically without even mentioning the root causes of the resurgence of Fascism.	0.5346452976357317
It can be explained by the feeling of helplessness of the people who are the victims of the ideology of mighty Mammon and by the choice of the ruling classes to promote strong government in order to take their policies of austerity and deregulation ever further.	0.6958793887074045
In order to oppose the xenophobic statements of an apprentice dictator who is nostalgic for the Third Reich, we must take every opportunity we can to express our solidarity with the Austrians opposed to Fascism.	0.7784604765866633
This is why we are voting in favour of this resolution in spite of its hypocritical references to a 'European democratic model' which bears more resemblance to a fortress which tracks downs, expels and imprisons immigrants without the proper papers, when it is not opening files on teenagers.	0.7208428901502031
- (DE) I have just voted against the motion for a resolution on the situation in Austria in view of a possible government being formed between the ÖVP and the FPÖ.	0.9813209838720461
I consider the casting of Jörg Haider as "Europe's scapegoat" (or even worse, neo-Nazi and Super Racist) to be counterproductive.	0.7523527061838657
Of course I, in no way, agree with the publicised statements of this right-wing populist and fully condemn xenophobia and any downplaying of the Hitler regime.	0.6773839916751005
However, I fear that a purely emotional reaction by Europe to the events in Austria will only multiply Haider's adherents.	0.7899870953964593
The EU must not do him an invaluable PR service.	0.49999344643045435
The strength of the FPÖ can be traced back to the weakness of the previous government and in this the Austrian socialists must bear the main responsibility.	0.826071925057262
It was only after they unsuccessfully solicited the FPÖ to tolerate a minority government and, obviously in vain, offered the Freedom Party ministerial posts, that the SPÖ begin its massive campaign against Haider.	0.6232748182426795
It turned its threatened loss of power into an "heroic battle for the preservation of values" and an imminent, pure-and-simple "decision between democracy and non-democracy" .	0.5248865093822447
This is a smear on the voters in my neighbouring country which I cannot condone.	0.5338924258421716
We German Christian Democrats used another strategy in the battle against extremists and clearly disassociated ourselves from them.	0.2903425060846741
We revealed the hollowness of the republicans who were nationalistic, xenophobic and anti-minority.	0.3988192956691454
Today the republicans are no longer represented in most local parliaments.	0.4819642716424632
The German approach is no guarantee that this radical movement will not grow again.	0.4325144896414533
It cannot be copied arbitrarily since each Member State has its own specific conditions.	0.5621040913704914
The ÖVP (Austrian People's Party), whose presence at European level we have also come to take for granted, is daring to attempt a coalition for the sake of governability in Austria.	0.7148835835626579
It can only succeed if agreements are made which are solidly based on compliance with democratic principles.	0.43943350652626856
The Council has become prematurely involved without waiting for the results of the coalition negotiations or a programme of government.	0.7206906240008971
This condemnation is as unacceptable as the threatened breaking off of official contacts with the Austrian Republic.	0.4345239142433759
Sound democracy means being alert and not blind in one eye.	0.31978485491754033
We must take up a reasoned offensive against radicals on both the right and the left.	0.6117683772077146
I would have liked to see the same outrage in Europe when the socialists were prepared to make common cause with the successors to the misanthropic and persecutory regime in the DDR.	0.5745608813010856
In the meantime, they have been forming governments in German federal states.	0.7119819450869467
I fully support the statements made by Commissioner Prodi in today's session.	0.6041033690878129
He spoke of the task of not isolating Member States but of doing everything to unite them in common European values.	0.6364756008405317
- (FR) I voted against the joint resolution on the situation in Austria.	1.0076304633163322
Austria is a free, independent and sovereign country.	0.5657632895696098
Consequently, neither the Council, the Commission nor the European Parliament has the right to interfere in the internal administration of a Member State.	1.0354694626966168
The Austrian elections were held in a free, proper and democratic manner.	0.5586414873886985
Any interference by the European institutions in this country is therefore unacceptable; it is in violation of the European Treaty (Article 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam).	1.0884519413271496
Nevertheless, these same institutions showed no reluctance to accept Turkey as a candidate for membership of the European Union, despite its well-known human rights violations.	0.7018210476453708
Nothing of this nature has yet occurred in Austria.	0.3137416854643398
This precedent, created on the initiative of the Portuguese Presidency, is a worrying one as far as the future of the European Union is concerned.	0.9318840735552288
On the one hand, the political excommunication of Austria only demonstrates the worrying influence of conformist thought. On the other hand, if tomorrow the governments of European Union Member States must first receive not the confidence of the nation but the endorsement of supranational bodies, then the very principle of democracy will be destroyed.	0.7916207377075997
In such circumstances will it even be worth having elections?	0.43321568515049297
This is not the way to create the conditions for the nations of Europe to live together in harmony and to be able to cooperate to achieve a shared future.	0.957488477461877
- (FR) The vote which has just taken place in this Chamber is a historic one for it is the first time we have ever debated the internal political situation of one of our Member States with such anxiety.	0.9577566810689112
I believe there are circumstances when the question of principles and institutional regulations is obliterated.	0.5480717586538834
I urge the Council and the Council Presidency to continue to protect the fundamental values of the Union.	1.1682567738017537
I urge the Commission to be less cautious.	1.0306668745653846
In this resolution, Parliament is assuming its responsibilities.	0.6903316494969567
Having said that, in my opinion, the resolution adopted today is the absolute minimum, the very least we could do.	0.9501697617214546
Personally I argued in favour of a rather harder line, and I supported Amendments Nos 1, 4, 6, 7 and 8, as well as the oral amendment tabled by the Socialist Group.	0.7966877081635025
In fact I consider it essential for the Council to accept only purely technical relations with the representatives of an Austrian Government which includes members of the Austrian Freedom Party.	0.912284149555043
Including Jörg Haider' s party in a coalition government makes the presence of the extreme right an everyday fact of life in Europe, and sets an extremely dangerous precedent which may generate a serious aftermath in other Union Member States or in candidate countries.	0.7096131778783344
The Austrian People' s Party must accept some historical responsibility for this.	0.6089556090967713
It is our fundamental values which are at stake here. As the democratically elected representatives of the European people, we have no choice.	1.2891510250904947
We must reject what is unacceptable, as our constituents demand.	0.8001181562346589
Because, when the spectre of barbarism resurfaces, failure to oppose is tantamount to capitulation.	0.5674667995050653
I abstained in the vote on adopting the resolution.	0.4584045931038224
I condemn Jörg Haider' s racist and xenophobic policy.	0.3653451394463774
However, I cannot accept that an EU body should intervene politically in the internal policy of one Member State.	0.8666774233687792
I cannot therefore accept paragraph 4 in the joint resolution, and I cannot vote in favour of the resolution, even though it would be a vote against the extreme right.	0.9881217902521724
- (SV) Obviously, the political leaders of Europe have a right and a duty to react against Mr Haider and his party.	0.7707390472696022
The political leaders of Europe are entitled to express their view of political developments in another Member State, just as a prime minister can express his opinion about racist politicians in a local authority.	0.6128832754180362
Finland' s experience, however, is that integration, rather than isolation, is the better way of combating antidemocratic forces.	0.8658868623978541
I therefore voted against paragraph 2 of the resolution, which presupposes that all parties have respect for human rights.	0.7007806009620487
The EU Presidency' s "common reaction" against the formation of the government in Austria is legally unjustified.	0.6163727663214016
The treaties do not authorise this reaction by the 14 Member States.	0.3876158878568877
Nor should we isolate the forces in Austria which wish to work for human rights.	0.5418504448713941
Despite these objections of mine to the Council' s action and despite my view that it is better to work for integration than to employ isolating tactics, it was important to show clearly where the European Parliament stands on questions of racism, which is why I voted in favour of the resolution at the final vote.	0.9110199841206226
That concludes the vote.	0.3812961285239357
Adjournment of the session	0.009435045885793508
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.	0.7408145502074662
(The sitting was closed at 12.25 p.m.)	0.38888991151887237
Resumption of the session	0.09254918046331684
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 3 February 2000.	0.5900920908319124
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting	0.5001406883779871
The Minutes of the sitting on Thursday 3 February have been distributed.	0.488523650701806
Are there any comments?	0.1201495129830156
I can see from your reaction that many of the Members of Parliament have not received the Minutes and clearly you cannot approve Minutes which you have not seen.	0.8527105139623408
I therefore propose to submit the Minutes for your approval tomorrow morning, since obviously you do not have them and I must apologise for this.	0.8114731425992324
I shall therefore postpone the approval of the Minutes.	0.7417093404314083
Madam President, on a point of order.	0.7810147633487436
The BBC this morning reported that a British Member of this House, holding a senior position within his delegation, continues to offer strategic advice to private clients, but does not state in the Register of Interests who these clients are.	0.5884169938755708
The people of Europe have a right to expect their representatives to keep the public interest separate from private profit, but they can only be sure that this is being done in all cases if the information is both publicly available and easily accessible.	0.9345324433556503
Madam President, since these matters are currently being considered by the Quaestors, may I ask you to use your influence both to ensure that the Register of Interests is brought up to date and modified to cover instances of this kind and, above all, to ensure that the Register is not only available for inspection by this House, but is also published on the Internet?	0.9398921582460862
Thank you, Mr Davies.	0.8387380269768563
I shall look into this matter with the College of Quaestors.	0.5599496897860061
Madam President, on a point of order.	0.7810147633487436
As this is the first Valentine' s Day of the new millennium I hope that you will agree with me that it would be fitting for this House to mark this day by making a firm commitment to tackling heart disease, the biggest killer in the European Union.	0.960220893855974
I would urge Members to sign up to the commitment made today at the Winning Hearts Conference that every child born in the new millennium has the right to live until the age of at least 65 without suffering from avoidable cardiovascular disease.	0.6757183637282865
Happy Valentine' s Day!	0.3919095576324154
Madam President, I rise under Rule 9 of the Rules of Procedure of this House and allude to the same point raised by Mr Davies about the very serious allegations made on BBC radio this morning.	0.8439220642598563
I would welcome an assurance from you that you will order an investigation to ensure that the two Members who were named in this particular BBC interview are not running their companies from this Parliament or from parliamentary offices, because that would be a very serious matter indeed.	0.8487492782020516
In the past the British Conservatives' double standards have brought the United Kingdom' s House of Commons into disrepute, and there is a very real danger that such behaviour would have a similar impact on this Parliament.	0.8668028257464412
Thank you, Mr Murphy.	0.7510028026715957
As I informed Mr Davies, I promise to look into this matter this very evening with the quaestors.	0.7135211426634687
Madam President, on a point of order.	0.7810147633487436
I have already written to you on a number of occasions concerning how points of order are raised in the House.	0.7241775726887595
I wonder on what point of order Mr Davies was speaking.	0.5150011056782501
Why did he not mention the fact that one of his own Liberal colleagues also has a consultancy that is under investigation by the BBC?	0.6158414794889888
Is this House going to let its agenda be determined by scurrilous reports on a programme which bases its news items on lies, or is it going to get down to serious work and address the challenges facing Europe?	0.5845483362358369
Gentlemen, obviously the quaestors who look into this matter are not going to be basing their assessment just on information from radio programmes.	0.6262433973356868
They will look into the matter thoroughly.	0.5765131191961158
Madam President, I believe I am expressing the feeling of a great number of Members of Parliament in most of the political groups when I say that the message which the President of the Commission sent to the new Austrian Chancellor a week ago created some unease.	1.0818369503607552
Was it in fact necessary in this message to specifically offer his best wishes for success, or to say, "I am sure that you will demonstrate the same commitment as shown by your predecessors to liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms" , or indeed that he awaited productive and constructive cooperation?	0.7433292234804623
This is why, Madam President, I should like to see Mr Prodi clarify tomorrow exactly what significance he meant to give these words, so that nobody, absolutely nobody, can use this message, which is unusual and unwise, to say the least, to contribute, and that includes counter to the intentions of Mr Prodi, towards making the dangerous political operation taking place in Austria a commonplace.	0.8832846687091325
Thank you, Mr Wurtz.	0.8387380269768563
I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, not to start a debate at this point. This was just a procedural motion.	0.9679349276277971
Let me remind you, Mr Wurtz, that we shall be seeing Mr Prodi tomorrow. He is going to make a statement on the Commission' s programme.	1.1564125680604391
Naturally you will be perfectly free to ask him questions in the speeches you make following this statement, just as Mr Prodi will be perfectly free to answer you.	0.6283740419320508
I suggest that you clarify this matter at that time, if you so wish and if Mr Prodi agrees.	0.6860312107888367
Madam President, it is with great regret that I have to trouble you yet again with an issue that I have raised here twice before.	0.9197463186624499
I have already told you on a number of occasions that we, on behalf of the Dutch contingency, would like a Dutch television channel.	0.7828165047920834
There are now 28 channels here in this Parliament, including two Greek, one Portuguese, one Finnish and one Belgian, but still no Dutch, and as many as seven English, six German and six French.	0.9668835443361045
I was promised back in September that there would be a Dutch channel by January.	0.6145235219719248
It is now February and we are still waiting.	1.0155553620388846
I would ask you once again to work on this.	0.9241898416404797
I wonder what kind of mediaeval bureaucracy is at work here preventing a Dutch channel from being transmitted by satellite.	0.4216754446002294
Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel, let me say how disappointed I am, because I personally thought this problem had been resolved long ago.	0.6182441158228429
I have clearly received your series of messages on this subject and I believe that Mrs Banotti has an answer for you.	0.6963449111910875
I shall therefore, with your permission, give the floor to Mrs Banotti to reply to you under the procedural motion.	0.8142063482780074
Madam President, as my dear friend Elly will know, I will do anything to make her and my Dutch colleagues happy.	0.9475194565502528
I would like to assure you as quaestor in charge of this issue that we have had technical discussions about the various channels on television and radio, and I have already started mailing colleagues in this connection.	0.9604850957143288
If it is of any comfort to her, the Irish have not got their channel yet either.	0.7605206685334113
There seem to be intractable technical problems but we are definitely working on it.	0.5515258875510274
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify this.	0.6174898816941589
I am not so sure that our Dutch Members will be reassured on the grounds that the Irish Members too are unable to receive a national channel.	0.70863062979204
I think we must do what we can to see that all Members can receive their own national channel.	0.9029309705866989
Thank you, Mrs Banotti, and also the other quaestors for your effort to achieve this.	1.0055823525121976
Madam President, I should like to tell Mr Wurtz that the Commission' s doctrine is not the Brezhnev doctrine of limited sovereignty and that, until proved otherwise, we are not in the situation where Articles 6 and 7 would be applicable.	0.9010198826078039
Austria, therefore, is perfectly entitled to form its government and the President of the Commission is perfectly entitled, and even duty bound, to offer Austria his best wishes.	0.9743543112963349
Mr Wurtz should perhaps remember that not so long ago other members of his party, the French Communist mayors, were sending bulldozers against immigrant hostels in France.	0.6446296982990405
Agenda	-0.0
The next item is the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents, pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure.	0.4893076895258598
a) Sittings from 14 to 18 February 2000 in Strasbourg Relating to Wednesday:	0.40113728769925433
President.	-0.0
In view of the fact that no Council representative is able to attend on Wednesday evening, a number of groups - the Group of the European People' s Party, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left - requested that the Council statement on the Cyprus question and Mr Brok' s report on the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta were dealt with during the joint debate and that these two items plus Mr Swoboda' s report were brought forward in the agenda.	0.7396155367770558
This would then give us, for Wednesday' s sitting, the two Council statements on the coherence of Union policies with development policy and on the UN 'Human Rights' sitting, followed by the joint debate on Cyprus and then the reports by Mr Swoboda, Mr Corrie, Mrs Frassoni and Mr Knörr Borràs.	0.8897937819137683
Is there anyone who wishes to speak on behalf of these groups in favour of this proposal?	0.558048841655203
Since no one wishes to speak, I shall put this proposal to the vote.	1.0227447128840608
(Parliament gave its assent)Relating to Thursday:	0.31020301130370526
President. I have received several proposed amendments relating to the topical and urgent subjects of major importance.	0.8011351749581674
On the subject of human rights, I have received two proposals for additions: one from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party for an item entitled 'Cambodia' and the other from the Group of the Greens, for an item entitled 'Pinochet' .	0.8025501049399606
As you know, we can only include five items in the 'Human Rights' section.	0.7969025636160854
According to the list given in the final version of the agenda, there are already four items.	0.8954675969189942
We can therefore table only one additional item.	0.45158905085150525
Who wishes to speak on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party to propose the addition of an item on Cambodia?	0.5129913019525191
Madam President, it is remarkable that the European Parliament has not yet adopted a position on the possible release of Mr Pinochet, despite the fact that international arrest warrants have already been issued.	0.8359843967882848
Since the Belgian Government' s appeal to a higher court was declared admissible last week and since the decision has essentially not yet been taken, it is important for Parliament to at last give out a strong message, a message which should signify that nobody can escape a just trial.	0.7709985362114169
It is inconceivable that the European Parliament, which quite rightly pays so much attention to respecting human rights, should fail to adopt a clear stance on this.	0.7061516812233873
Madam President, this matter is far too serious to be dealt with by means of an urgent procedure at this time.	0.8266155643515445
Firstly, the European Parliament has already expressed its opinion on the subject of General Pinochet, but, furthermore, there are certain questions to be borne in mind.	1.013417398667595
The first is that this matter is sub judice in several European countries, and I would like to remind Members that there is still no European judicial area nor a European legal system.	0.9062360013950779
We are in favour of the International Criminal Court, but it does not yet exist.	1.0540202455205163
Secondly, there is currently a democratically elected government in Chile, led by Ricardo Núñez, whose first declaration was that all those who have committed this type of crime must face justice, and I would remind you that the Chilean justice system, which is independent, is currently examining 60 complaints lodged against General Pinochet, concerning his crimes against humanity.	0.8304535555118091
I believe that this is a serious issue which we are obliged to follow up, but it should not be dealt with by means of urgent procedure.	1.0719175042096853
We believe that justice should be done in this case, but this is not the most appropriate procedure.	1.1958740729019623
(Parliament rejected the proposal) President.	0.3366121433577505
We now come to the third proposal which is for 'Environmental disasters in the waters of the Danube' , a proposal tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.	0.7013654657146897
Is there a Member who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal?	0.5112302463062454
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what has occurred in a tributary of the Danube is considered by many experts to be an accident on an environmental scale as serious as the scale of the Chernobyl disaster.	0.6953878319248897
It affects not only Romania, but also Yugoslavia and, in fact, the entire Danube basin.	0.9403584546134298
We consider the matter to be important enough for the Commission to react swiftly to this situation, and I think that Parliament must make its position clear and vote on a resolution on the subject.	1.0349889802055443
(Parliament gave its assent) President.	0.24744211582555675
Still relating to Thursday' s sitting, the PPE Group has requested that Mrs Cederschiöld' s report on increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro should be brought forward to Wednesday as the last item on the agenda.	0.7036266609889027
Is there a Member who wishes to speak on behalf of the PPE in favour of this proposal?	0.547137903297912
Madam President, the agenda has been rearranged so many times that I would simply ask the Chamber to support the present proposal.	0.9727977896459912
It is not a very time-consuming matter, but it is extremely important that it should get through Parliament now and that there should be no delays.	1.0298402379564227
It is in fact about protecting the euro against counterfeiting, which is an extremely urgent matter.	1.0648551182762724
We have tried to drive this proposal through.	0.3720006143216212
I should therefore be very grateful indeed if the Chamber could support it.	0.6814143103127949
(Parliament gave its assent)	0.038249974869252856
Relating to Friday: President.	0.29399454146554355
Relating to Friday, on Friday morning we have an oral question on postal services and the Group of the Party of European Socialists is requesting that the motions for resolutions should be put to the vote immediately after the debate and not in Brussels, as envisaged in the final version of the draft agenda.	0.9372983796506149
Is there a Member who wishes to speak on behalf of the PSE Group in favour of this proposal?	0.5045250779677498
Madam President, with apologies to my friend, Enrique Barón Crespo, I should like to speak against this proposal.	0.8126830780166552
I am surprised it has even been made, because we came to an agreement following an exchange in the Conference of Presidents.	0.7407138609868272
I think that your proposal, Madam President, to keep the debate and the vote separate, with the debate on Friday and the vote at a later date, is a reasonable one.	0.9772257728121208
