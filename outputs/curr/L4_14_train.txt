It is unique in that its expression is regulated directly by hypoxia.	0.3452539726090206
These properties are now being exploited in attempts aimed at the induction of new blood vessels in pathological situations such as ischemic heart disease.	0.4314370344815676
Five VEGF forms of 121 to 206 amino-acids are produced from a single gene by alternative splicing.	0.38066853909108456
Cells expressing VEGF usually express several forms simultaneously.	0.20268971770361652
VEGF121 does not contain exons 6 and 7 of the gene and consequently lacks a heparin binding ability.	0.47991243846765835
However, this form is fully  active as an inducer of angiogenesis, and as a blood vessel permeabilizing agent.	0.7373811084385592
Exon 6 and 7 contain 2 independent heparin binding domains.	0.3687272140060575
The VEGF form containing exon 7 (VEGF165) and the vascular endothelial growth factor form containing exon 6 (VEGF145) display similar biological potencies raising the question of why so many VEGF forms are required.	0.5862625295305849
It was found that VEGF121 diffuses better because it does not bind to heparan-sulfate proteoglycans.	0.4209549563032157
In contrast, VEGF145 binds to extracellular matrix ad is released from it slowly.	0.29167422046989266
When the receptor binding properties of VEGF121 and VEGF165 were compared it was found that VEGF165 binds to a class of VEGF receptors that is not recognized by VEGF121.	0.46901726980648406
These receptors are encoded by the neuropilin-1 gene, and we have recently found that the related neuropilin-2 gene also encodes a VEGF165 receptor.	0.5851284396490822
We have recently found evidence indicating the neuropilins form complexes with another VEGF receptor, VEGFR-1.	0.33747895109603404
However, the biological function of this complex remains to be elucidated.	0.665041302124922
In addition to mucositis and myelotoxicity as well known early reactions after radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy in advanced head and neck tumors, late toxicity following treatment is an often underestimated problem.	0.5566053205989147
The healing of wounds by secondary  intention is a simple method to close  operative defects.	0.5766568554231876
The quality of wound healing will depend on the anatomic site on the face as well as on size and depth of the  defect.	0.7150396001534708
Best functional and cosmetic results are obtained at locations with concave  geometry and when the defect lies  symmetrically at the interface of two  anatomic subunits.	0.478392559510059
Partial reconstruction or guiding sutures can create a symmetric  defect in relation to anatomic subunits which will heal by second intention.	0.34152468185195606

Background: Acute infectious mononucleosis (IM) is a selflimiting lymphoproliferative disease of EBV-infected (immortalised) B cells and poly-/oligoclonal cytotoxic T cells which are to a high percentage EBV-specific.	0.5875670351034592
In B cells EBV infection mainly leads to a latent infection with expression of EBV nuclear antigens 1-6 (EBNA1-6) and membrane antigens 1, 2A and 2B (LMP1, LMP2A and LMP2B).	0.5393357754286946
Expression of these EBV latent antigens leads to transformation and immortalisation of infected B cells.	0.2992343077388926

The typical clinical features of myasthenia gravis are weakness and excessive fatiguability of striated muscles that increases during the course of the day or after strenous exercise.	0.5703786072324547
Ocular muscle involvement with ptosis (in 50%) and diplopia (in 25%) are the most common initial signs.	0.8795147746246255
The disease can progress to bulbar muscles and to all other striated muscles (generalized myasthenia).	0.45218088819192215
The muscle fatiguability and a fluctuating course can mislead to a diagnosis of neurasthenia.	0.3870533265886645
Since the treatment of myasthenia gravis is directed at the pathogenetic mechanisms of the disease an early diagnosis is of great significance for the course of the disease.	0.8237519073717443
Also, a false positive diagnosis of myasthenia has to be avoided because of the potentially hazardous side effects of the therapy.	0.8410949305476004

Vasculitides are rare diseases characterized by inflammation of blood vessels.	0.5458777376130673
According to diameter of the blood vessels involved in the inflammatory process, the clinical presentation and the histological appearance, different vasculitic syndromes may be distinguished.	0.8849849773127285
Primary vasculitides are of unknown origin while secondary vasculitides may be caused by drugs, malignancy or infection.	0.377064543408825
Panarteriitis nodosa caused by chronic Hepatitis B and mixed cryoglobulinemia secondary to chronic Hepatitis C are classical examples of vasculitides triggered by infections.	0.39834480917641185
However, these are rare complications of chronic viral hepatitis.	0.6918958261640924
Patients infected by HIV frequently suffer from vasculitis, which may be caused by opportunistic infections and by defects in immune regulation.	0.5955495416346533
In numerous case reports, various other infectious particles have been reported to cause different forms of vasculitis, either by direct infection of endothelial cells or by induction of an immunologic process leading to blood vessel destruction.	0.6017469481634917
Immunologically mediated vasculitis secondary to infection may be due to a predisposing reactivity of the patient's immune system.	0.6361572180048626
After successful treatment of the infection, the vasculitis usually subsides.	0.709380565000751
Therefore, all patients with vasculitis should be evaluated for underlying infection.	0.8927340873589638
To calculate canal compromise and decrease of midsagittal diameter caused by retropulsion of fragments into the spinal canal we analyzed the pre- and postoperative computed tomographies of 32 patients with unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures treated by USS (universal spine system).	0.5758643078047384
Our intention was to examine the efficiency of ultrasound guided repositioning of the dispaced fragments which was performed in all 32 cases.	0.6402867836480292
We found a clear postoperative enlargement of canal area (ASP preoperatively 55 %, postop.	0.5406824479927421
80 %) and midsagittal diameter (MSD preop.	0.6088424245273769
10 of 13 patients presented a postoperative improvement of neurological deficit, no neurological deterioration occured.	0.5712816812738648
Fractures with neurological deficit showed more canal compromise (52 %) and less midsagittal diameter (MSD compromise 51 %) than those without (40 % or 39 %).	0.7194135559891157
There was no correlation between the percentage of spinal canal stenosis and the severity of neurological deficit.	0.6169060030670062
Below L 1 the spinal canal is greater than between Th 11 and L 1, so a more important spinal stenosis is tolerated.	0.6233025072134007
In case of unstable burst fractures with neurological deficit the ultrasound guided spinal fracture reposition is an effective procedure concerning the necessary improvement of spinal stenosis: an additional ventral approach for the revision of the spinal canal is unneeded.	0.611728989880899
In fractures without neurologic deficit the repositioning of the displaced fragments promises an avoidance of long-term damages such as myelopathia and claudicatio spinalis.	0.3643519933389086
In common the traumatic spondylolisthesis is not a life threatening injury.	0.604564789927848
An exact diagnosis is mandatory as well as a differentiated therapy.	0.641575784297838

Objective: The objective of this survey was to investigate the current status of the epidural and intrathecal management in patients with chronic cancer and non-cancer pain in Germany and Austria.	0.8402358564967142
Methods: In June 1997 a questionnaire was sent to 598 German and Austrian anaesthesiologists specialized in pain therapy.	0.4794982956809921
Questions concerning the use of medicaments for epidural and intrathecal treatment of chronic pain were asked.	0.6248401836346007
Results: The response rate was 23%.	0.5993080306840284
The data show that 78% of the anaesthesiologists use epidural or intrathecal analgesia in the therapy of chronic pain.	0.6448398032484721
Local anaesthetics are used by 85% of these anaesthesiologists, followed by morphine (72%), clonidine (48%), buprenorphine (34%), baclofen (20%), fentanyl (13%) and sufentanil (10%).	0.7397450900251256
For most of the treatments local anaesthetics are used, again followed by opioids und clonidine.	0.5683809617164886
In the 137 answering pain clinics 79.821 epidural and intrathecal analgetic treatments are performed per year.	0.3509295906602848
Discussion: Epidural and intrathecal pain therapy is frequently used in Germany and Austria, either as a complementary or alternative treatment to systemic pain therapy.	0.6359192114687114
Local anaesthetics followed by opioids are the most commonly used medicaments for this treatment.	0.5617057075098228
For some of the applied substances neurotoxicological data are lacking.	0.54070540427627
The use of these substances has to be considered very carefully.	0.8355837388306696
Intraartial conduction disturbances (IACD) are the known substrate of re-entrant atrial arrhythmias and their diagnosis is important for the selection of proper therapy.	0.6384277391081107
Signs of IACD can be missed on the standard ECG, and signal averaged (SA) P wave analysis has proved valuable for the evaluation of electrophysiological (EPS) properties of atrial myocardium.	0.501329966230288
Unfavourable EPS effects of RAA pacing are known to electrophysiologists, but this aspect is rarely considered in normal practice, and RAA based pacing modes remain standard even for pts.	0.6073626235026705
We examined and compared EPS effects of different atrial pacing modes using two diagnostic tools: IEGM obtained from two atrial leads of biatrial pacing system (via telemetry) and time domain analysis of SA P wave in 22 pts.	0.5317470707658701
with BiA pacing system (implanted due to atrial arrhythmias and IACD).	0.38667629846890256
The results showed that different atrial pacing modes influence atrial activation timing parameters differently: RAA pacing aggravates IACD in comparison to sinus rhythm; the effects of CS pacing is less visible.	0.5163069345747019
BiA pacing normalises all atrial activation times.	0.20665301225384164
The normalisation of SA P wave duration, reduction of SA P wave dispersion, increasing of RMS 20 and decreasing of LAS 5 and finally abolition of presence of late atrial potentials in most of pts.	0.4667925309537145
indicates beneficial effects of BiA pacing (in pts.	0.5527925989580914
with IACD) in comparison to sinus rhythm and RAA pacing.	0.7128793997973136
Unfavourable EPS effects of RAA pacing in patients with IACD indicates suitability the need for alternative (resynchronising) atrial pacing modes.	0.4465565663851455
Time domain analysis of SA P wave is a valuable and sensitive diagnostic tool for non-invasive evaluation of EPS effects of different modes of atrial pacing.	0.5793082343980132

Goal of our study is morphological examination of laser channels in human hearts to answer the questions: Are there patent laser channels with communication to the left chamber and to intramural vessels?	0.5851482010968718
We examined hearts of 10 patients who died during the first 18 days after TMLR.	0.6891998841603807
Channels were examined in histological serial sections under the light microscope.	0.4655070243588504
Laser channels in the first days postoperatively have a lumen diameter of about 1 mm and are surrounded by coagulation necrosis about 500 µm thick.	0.535020427495825
Despite phagocytic removal of necrotic tissue the lumen diameter decreases during the following two weeks.	0.42512576265135144
Open intramyocardial channels can be shown in all patients.	0.4501649904957823
These channels communicate with intramural vessels, but in no instance with chamber lumen.	0.5710676554256899
Our results suggest that clinical benefits are based on improved distribution of coronary blood.	0.45873945633174695
Additional blood is not delivered from left chamber lumen to the myocardium.	0.3754799085410137
However, our patients represent the small subgroup of the deceased.	0.6620754185622505
If similar observations can be made in the majority of patients living symptomfree after TMLR remains open.	0.6040169029265596
Recurrent miscarriages are, like sporadically occurring miscarriage, often (approx.	0.5210810987986843
50 %) due to chromosomal aberrations.	0.4447284160498017
An undefined proportion of the other half may be due to immunological incompliances.	0.4645669720350701
The basis for this assumption is the fact that the maternal immune system recognizes paternal antigens and rejects them.	0.5439911663419579
The initial hypothesis that such immune reaction is due to a high similarity between the maternal and paternal HLA systems (HLA sharing) is most likely incorrect.	0.6669861647033575
Nevertheless, the incomplete recognition of the fetus by the maternal immune system and the resulting insufficient protection is basis for the active immune therapy with partner or donor lymphocytes.	0.6715887413236055
Several placebo-controlled studies have been performed.	0.7123168757347644
Due to the small number of cases, results were not significant.	0.7952454159931
A metaanalysis of all studies, however, proves significant effects of the active immune therapy.	0.4739506515955584
The risks of active immune therapy led to the development of passive immune therapy with immune globulins (IVIG).	0.49558975893431806
This therapy, however, is relatively expensive and obviously no more successful than the active immune therapy.	0.48072293461792254
In a metaanalysis of all published results, IVIG was not significantly more effective than treatment with placebo.	0.5690125606751953
The indication for both forms of immune therapy is given after 3 or more consecutive abortions, after exclusion of other reasons for these abortions.	0.6286927960471304
It appears that only primary aborting patients are suitable for active immune therapy.	0.40459485841362886
Athough the concept of immune therapy is still under debate, alternative concepts are not available.	0.6144626331685878
Hence, new therapeutic approaches are also not available.	0.7130970606715709
The first electronic implantable hearing aids for patients with hearing loss are coupled to the ossicular chain or perilymph during implantation and are now available.	0.5438812854808753
Our new Tübingen implant designed for sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is the combination of an implantable microphone and piezotransducer.	0.5983478473990244
To avoid hearing losses during implantation, the Tübingen piezotransducer will be (1) fixed to the mastoid cavity and (2) positioned to one of the ossicular target points.	0.6461674589610326
This can be done with a micromanipulator which will be implanted together with transducer and microphone in the mastoid cavity.	0.5636699390061712
The manipulator weights 0.7 g. With four degrees of freedom, it allows highly secure and safe positioning of the transducer's probe tip to the ossicular chain under close to stereotactic conditions.	0.6610478401408513
The main advantages of the present micromanipulator are (1) easy handling during surgery, (2) the transducer's precise positioning to the ossicular target point with sufficient degrees of freedom, and (3) the transducer's stable fixation in the mastoid cavity in the final position.	0.7756520381859463
Following integrated safety as the leading principle, ossicular or inner ear injuries caused, e.g., by the patient's head movement or unintentional manual contact by the surgeon, are minimized.	0.6379463263162377
The micromanipulator is, as it were, the surgeon's vibration-free "artificial hand".	0.7338787384787347
The manipulator's development and its optimization to the mastoid cavity by test implantation in 50 human temporal bones are shown in detail.	0.43688537866574745
While coupling the transducer to the body of the incus, transducer, microphone, and micromanipulator can be implanted into 76% of all mastoid cavities without protrusion.	0.6222809093707831
In the case of transducers coupling to the long process of the incus, the protrusion-free implantation rate of the above-mentioned three implant modules is 78%.	0.5782862403558743
The role of neuroimaging in the acute setting of head trauma is to diagnose the extent of intracranial injury and to identify all lesions which require urgent neurosurgical treatment.	0.5584516331929447
Computed tomography (CT) remains the most important diagnostic tool for initial screening of trauma victims.	0.7036467763658617
Although magnetic resonance imaging (MR) has higher sensitivity to most traumatic lesions than CT, due to the ease and speed of CT, and the fact that sufficient monitoring of critically ill patients during the examination is much easier with CT than with MR, mean that MR is not the imaging modality of choice for the initial diagnostic work-up.	0.6924979473804531
Recent MR techniques such as FLAIR or diffusion imaging further improve the sensitivity of MR in head trauma.	0.4249847593235017
Conventional angiography is currently indicated only for few suspected vascular lesions (e.g.	0.2974515385890077
traumatic arterio-venous fistulas, vascular dissections).	0.44610501274420233
Injuries to the posterior cruciate ligament are among the major injuries to the knee joint.	0.6091978208277508
Today we are often confronted with an inapproprate and delayed diagnosis of this injury and its concomitant lesions.	0.4735380243994225
Additionally, the outcome of operative treatment has not yet reached an acceptable rate of satisfactory results.	0.7154050336991885
Therefore, the goal of this current concept review is to give a comprehensive insight into anatomy and biomechanics, injury mechanisms and pathobiomechanics, based on our experiences and data from the international literature.	0.6600715410209248
A further goal is to clarify diagnostic problems with respect to clinical examination and imaging techniques.	0.5575730258192158
We also present a differential concept for the perioperative and conservative management of posterior cruciate ligament deficient knees in order to also adequately address concomitant injuries such as posterolateral rotatory instability and combined anterior cruciate ligament injuries with the aim of further improving results.	0.49144833359899565
Sevoflurane, like all currently used volatile anaesthetics, is degraded by carbon dioxide absorbents.	0.5439194449499953
The most significant degradant is a haloalkene known trivially as "compound A".	0.5115418524577592
Compound A is nephrotoxic in rats and, at higher doses, in nonhuman primates, causing proximal tubular necrosis.	0.6467619598456323
There has been much interest in the potential for compound A toxicity in humans.	0.6258321136887196
Inhaled compound A concentrations are greatest at low flow rates, high sevoflurane concentrations, warmer absorbent, barium hydroxide vs soda lime, and drier absorbent.	0.5370851995612371
Typical inspired compound A concentrations during low-flow and closed-circuit sevoflurane anaesthesia in humans are 8-24 and 20-32 ppm with soda lime and barium hydroxide lime, respectively.	0.5140430625271502
Renal effects of compound A production during sevoflurane anesthesia have been examined in surgical patients and volunteers, using standard (creatinine clearance, serum BUN and creatinine) and experimental (urine excretion of protein, glucose, NAG, GST, AAP) markers of renal function.	0.5469913129256555
Investigations to date in surgical patients show similar renal effects of low-flow sevoflurane, low-flow isoflurane or high-flow sevoflurane.	0.8252196054021373
There have been no case reports of compound A-associated renal injury in humans.	0.5975522032729961
In volunteers, one study found changes in experimental but not conventional renal markers, while other investigations show no significant changes in either standard or experimental markers.	0.5822233737774194
The mechanism of compound A nephrotoxicity in rats appears to involve metabolism to glutathione and cysteine conjugates, and their subsequent renal uptake and metabolism by pathways that are different in rats and humans.	0.5345256462534271
In the report of the 1995 World Health Federation/International Society and Federation of Cardiology (WHF/ISFC) Task Force on the Definition and Classification of Cardiomyopathies, the definition of heart muscle diseases was updated.	0.4838954883496276
Idiopathic, autoimmune, and infectious forms of inflammatory cardiomyopathy are now recognized in this definition.	0.5039886970405378
Enteroviruses, adenoviruses and cytomegaloviruses are considered as main etiopathological factors in the pathogenesis of inflammatory heart disease.	0.4187976555756469
We report our experience in managing a temporal bone fracture after head trauma that had no apparent clinical signs.	0.5208605890299343
Recurrent CSF rhinorrhea and meningitis lead to extensive diagnostic procedures.	0.2515584544199711
Operative exploration of the temporal bone demonstrated a fracture line along the horizontal part of the carotid artery.	0.5615678846205886
The location of the fracture did not cause such typical symptoms as hearing impairment, facial paralysis, vertigo or tinnitus.	0.573483394930104
Only CSF liquorrhea through the Eustachian tube indicated a fracture at the lateral skull base.	0.415653415427502
Hyperkeratosis lenticularis perstans (Flegel's disease) is a rare but clinically and histologically highly characteristic genodermatosis.	0.6852907891123237
We report on new immunohistochemical and ultrastructural findings suggesting a complex disorder of epidermal differentiation.	0.5717282199717078
In this context, a good response to calcipotriol, a synthetic vitamin D3 derivative is of particular interest.	0.7056019972872088
Pulmonary embolism is a frequent and potentially life-threatening event with uncharacteristic clinical manifestations.	0.6272084023044534
Diagnosis is commonly established by ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy and pulmonary angiography.	0.35233169308203205
Both methods, however, carry substantial drawbacks.	0.35402657601831106
Therefore, clinicians claim that there is a need for an accurate and non-invasive diagnostic modality.	0.6735025915037116
Spiral CT of the pulmonary arteries is a recent modality, that allows reliable visualization of emboli in pulmonary arteries up to fourth-order branches.	0.6145463140798654
This paper reviews the technical aspects, typical findings and diagnostic pitfalls of this recent technique.	0.5109895281246231
The potential role of spiral CT in the screening of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism is discussed and selected cases are presented.	0.8040095649145114
Introduction: Interleukin-12-p70 (IL-12-p70) is a potent immunoregulatory cytokine composed of a heavy chain (p40) and a light chain (p35).	0.6890447636583663
Contradicting results have been reported with regard to leukocyte release and systemic concentration of IL-12 after polytrauma.	0.6560044487707105
Methods: We daily analyzed systemic concentrations of IL-12 in polytrauma patients (n = 37, mean ISS 33.9) in comparison to healthy donor values during intensive care course by ELISA.	0.6740130832736013
Patients were divided according to their mean IL-12 levels into those with elevated IL-12 (group 1, n = 7), those with decreased IL-12 (group 2, n = 4) and those with IL-12 in the normal range (group 3, n = 26).	0.8861199190054515
Results: Patients in group 1 revealed elevated levels of IL-12 up to p70 > 1000 pg/ml and p40 > 2500 pg/ml.	0.7444897315300291
The common clinical feature of group 1 was a thorax trauma in combination with pneumonia (85 % survivors).	0.6179303582066532
Patients with single thorax trauma or pneumonia without thorax trauma (group 3) showed normal IL-12 values.	0.7498185598839592
Patients with decreased IL-12 levels revealed also a thorax trauma and pneumonia but all patients succumbed.	0.46444959590731255
The groups significantly differ in their stay in the intensive care unit, in TISS, in MODS score and in respiratory ratio, but not in ISS, mean CRP values and leukocyte counts.	0.785952907749216
Correlation analysis revealed no significant relation between systemically altered IL-12 values and clinical parameters, with the exception of a negative correlation of p70 and ISS (r = -0.785) or MODS score (r = -0.314) in group 1.	0.6591615793020262
Conclusions: After major injuries there is no overall suppression of IL-12 formation.	0.6407948002410597
Patients with normal or elevated IL-12 levels belong mainly to the survivors, whereas patients with decreased IL-12 levels are at high risk of succumbing to multi-organ failure.	0.6722423177293413
This article reviews the pathogenesis and clinical and imaging findings in shoulder impingement syndrome.	0.5760375070799308
Shoulder impingement is caused by compression of the supraspinatus tendon underneath the coracoacromial arch, mainly in forward flexion of the arm.	0.5078479525536841
Different stages of impingement syndrome are described.	0.3695301910016478
Stage I relates to edema and hemorrhage of the supraspinatus tendon.	0.3255677070223421
Stage II is characterized by bursal inflammation and fibrosis, as well as tendinopathy.	0.465818960186898
In stage III there is a tear of the rotator cuff.	0.5629578480767495
Moreover, calcifying tendinitis, fractures and pain originating from the cervical spine may mimic shoulder impingement syndrome.	0.5026240834301783
Imaging is important for the exact diagnosis.	0.6394077417310134
Standard radiographs are the basis of imaging in shoulder impingement syndrome.	0.36175281376204566
They may demonstrate subchondral sclerosis of the major tuberosity, subacromial spurs, and form anomalies of the acromion.	0.5376187250541645
They are also important in the differential diagnosis of shoulder impingement syndrome and demonstrate calcifying tendinitis, fractures and neoplasm.	0.6000861694202725
Ultrasonography has found acceptance as a screening tool and even as a final diagnostic method by many authors.	0.5515560404363521
However, there is a high interobserver variability in the demonstration of rotator cuff tears.	0.7627518193979844
Its usefulness has therefore been questioned.	0.3302737393149788
MR imaging is probably the method of choice in the evaluation of the rotator cuff and surrounding structures.	0.7138846064572055
Several investigations have demonstrated that differentiation of early findings, such as tendinopathy versus partial tears, may be difficult with MR imaging.	0.5906753764781032
However, reproducibility for full-thickness tears appears to be higher than for sonography.	0.489868963469387
Moreover, specificity appears to be superior to sonography.	0.5429540734114348
MR arthrography is not universally accepted.	0.3568375779904951
However, it allows for more exact differentiation of discrete findings and may be indicated in preoperative planning.	0.7775007317558783
Standard arthrography and CT have a limited role in the current assessment of the rotator cuff.	0.6172998150466402
Gastric carcinoma of the infiltrative type (according to Ming) occasionally shows adenomatous differentiation only.	0.3558767440127686
Over the past 18 years, we have observed 23 cases of this tumour type, accounting for 3.6 % of all surgically treated gastric carcinomas.	0.8582364893783204
Macroscopically they were classified as Borrmann IV or III, while histologically most of them were well differentiated.	0.6194987214959868
Histologically, these tumours retained the pre-existing structures of the stomach, most readily observable at the tunica muscularis propria; a pronounced desmoplasia was also characteristic, particularly in the submucosal and subserosal layers.	0.6419699134744283
In all cases the tumour tissue spread inside lymphatic vessels.	0.5750065491340011
All but 2 cases with metastatically involved lymph nodes, often small, showed infiltration of the lymph node sinus; in three quarters of cases the serosa was infiltrated by the tumour.	0.6943996292349882
Significant findings among the patients under observation for extended periods included bilateral ovarian metastases in 4 of 5 women examined and tumour recurrence at the anastomosis in 6 of 9 patients in whom Billroth II operation had been performed.	0.521105382210222
The mean survival time of 16 patients was 14.9 months.	0.6224377322253505
Owing to the diffuse type of tumour growth, extensive surgery is recommended as in cases of signet ring cell cancer.	0.6291255302314709
The high incidence of small lymph node metastases from this type of tumour should also be taken in account at preoperative staging.	0.5706184906436266
Preoperative diagnosis of this tumour subtype is difficult, because histological criteria alone do not allow clear identification.	0.6449164723126204
Close cooperation with clinical investigators is necessary, and intraoperative assessment of the tumour - including frozen section of necessary - in particular is of the outmost importance.	0.8746724850787851
One rare case of so-called massive idiopathic osteolysis Gorham-Stout is presented.	0.29468999452459904
In a 77-year-old female patient the whole right femoral head and neck of femur was resorbed within 2.5 month following trauma.	0.6283893156520789
As a histologic cause for the osteolysis, a marked stimulation of osteoclasts on the spongiosa, especially intracortically, was observed.	0.6720760364036498
The course and the clinical findings are described, and the pathogenesis and treatment are discussed in comparison with the present literature.	1.0952949727305248
The results suggest that an early antiresorptive therapy (calcitonin, bisphosphonates) could stop the progressive osteolytic changes.	0.5163647212286182
In this paper the relationship between psychodiagnosis and client-centered therapy is discussed.	0.663211206868983
Rogers is wrongly said to have rejected any kind of diagnosis and that this therapy form has therefore developed an ambiguous relationship to this issue.	0.49114868202405726
If one sees psychodiagnosis as something psychodynamic, and symptoms as defense strategies against underlying conflicts, then a comprehensive 'status diagnosis' using more or less traditional psychiatric categories appears compatible with theory-led client-centered diagnosis in the initial phase and during the course of therapy.	0.4933796223661871
Client-centered psychotherapy itself may be seen as a continuous process of dialogue in which 'assumed diagnoses' (embedded in the therapist's 'empathic knowledge') are jointly checked and in which the client through direct experience learns to understand and change his 'diagnosis'.	0.5441899565046191
In the examination of reversible segmental (articular) hypomobile dysfunction (blockage) of the spine, we have to recognize by palpation the feeling of beginning resistance at the end of the passive movement ("barrier").	0.6454374611698057
This is the main finding to diagnose segmental (articular) dysfunction.	0.5321502738431221
Normal mobility gives us a slowly increasing resistance with possible springing at the end.	0.4528830388552382
In contrary, the sudden feeling of hard tension without springing is seen as typical for the restricted movement in articular dysfunction, i. e. restriction of joint facet gliding.	0.5173575846276379
Multiple intra- and paraglandular lymph nodes develop in the parotid gland, including salivary gland tissue with acinar and ductal formations.	0.6089719567349962
In the same way heterotopic salivary gland tissue can be localized in cervical lymph nodes.	0.6604654878782501
Except for the frequently occurring Warthin tumours, primary salivary gland tumours, which develop in the lymph nodes of the parotid gland or the cervical lymph nodes, are rare.	0.7427439627230742
Examples of these are adenomas (pleomorphic adenoma, basal cell adenoma) and carcinomas (acinic cell carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma).	0.5028900575503943
Three of our own observations (sebaceous lymphadenoma, acinic cell carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma) are analysed.	0.5145216196592967
The condition for the diagnosis of primary salivary gland tumour within a lymph node is reliable evidence that the salivary gland tissue is tumour-free and that no other occult carcinoma is present.	0.6097305582878427
We report on a three month old infant presenting with vaginal bleeding.	0.5377998630365594
Precocious pseudopuberty due to an autonomous ovarian cyst was diagnosed.	0.3585603531096582
Within three months the follicular cyst spontaneously regressed.	0.3730949944251849
Elevated estradiol levels also decreased spontaneously.	0.15589503829581622
The purpose of this study was to determine whether 24 hour patch testing with 0.5% sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) could reliably predict skin susceptibility to an irritant when compared with the alkali resistance test (ART), a widely used method employing sodium hydroxide.	0.6496275360852277
After having given informed consent, 40 patients (age range from 20 to 60 years) with an active irritant contact dermatitis (ICD), 40 patients in whom ICD had cleared, as well as 40 healthy volunteers serving as controls were tested.	0.6805032541526842
The skin responses to SLS were assessed both visually and by measurement of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) as an indicator of stratum corneum integrity.	0.5365510372888138
SLS significantly increased the erythema scores and TEWL in patients with healed ICD, and the increase of TEWL was even more pronounced in patients with active ICD.	0.6997252558948929
By contrast, a decrease in alkali resistance was found in patients with active ICD only but not in patients with healed ICD.	0.7148811607306053
The data obtained indicate that the SLS test, unlike ART, may provide a non-invasive tool predicting a possible constitutional skin susceptibility or indicating a subclinically impaired epidermal barrier function.	0.583818010202095
However, because of the relatively high interindividual variation, a cut-clear statement concerning the skin susceptibility cannot be made by this test.	0.7043530578987541
On the other hand, the ART seems only to be useful for following and documenting the healing period following ICD.	0.5259343627689388
Introduction: The correction of low to moderate astigmatism is possible today by means of photoablation (PRK), while the treatment of moderate and higher astigmatism still involves refractive keratotomy.	0.6256273054832682
Experience has shown that cataract surgery, using modern tunnel techniques with self-healing incisions, results in earlier stability in both the refractive outcome and wound healing.	0.6378283933292992
In this study, we attempted to combine the advantages of lamellar keratotomy with those of a pair-wise T-incision as arcuate lamellar keratotomy (ALK).	0.570242849694363
An often unrecognized but potentially fatal complication, mostly seen in posttraumatic patients under intensive care, is reactive acute cholecystitis.	0.528744484621107
On account of the high specificity of ultrasound diagnosis in the biliary system we decided to examine the ultrasound criteria for early detection of posttraumatic cholecystitis.	0.664430206483729
Ultrasound of the abdomen was performed prospectively, seven times on different days, in each of 40 artificially respirated patients under intensive care conditions over a period of 12 months.	0.593316200651618
The results show that artificial respiration, parenteral feeding and previous trauma can lead to tardive (28/40) wallthickening or to a three-layered wall of the gallbladder (9/40).	0.5993298977094805
In 22.5 % of patients (9/40) we found the sonographic signs of acute cholecystitis.	0.8927251969070408
In correlation with the clinical signs, cholecystectomy was indicated in only two patients.	0.687076404959338
The preoperative ultrasonographic findings and clinical signs of 23 patients with the diagnosis of acute reactive cholecystitis were analysed retrospectively.	0.7010476212881281
We found good correlation between sonographic and clinical signs of acute cholecystitis in 21 of these 23 patients.	0.48200069003145035
Our study shows that the morphological correlate of a thickened three-layered gallbladder wall can occur in the context of systemic alterations, even if there is no underlying cholecystitis.	0.6571834810094441
The diagnosis of acute reactive cholecystitis and the indication for cholecystectomy should be based on the synopsis of pathologic and clinical findings.	0.6225196542284024
Osteoporosis is characterized by reduced bone mass and a deterioration of bone structure which results in an increased fracture risk.	0.6072091773310971
The purpose of this review is to evaluate structure analysis techniques in the diagnosis of osteoporosis.	0.7023571876258131
Several imaging techniques were applied to analyze trabecular bone, such as conventional radiography, high-resolution computed tomography (HR-CT) and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI).	0.766599231549055
The best results were obtained using high-resolution tomographic techniques.	0.7329412895490087
The highest spatial resolutions in vivo were achieved using HR-MRI.	0.32957510477130203
These studies show that texture parameters and bone mineral density predict bone strength and osteoporotic fractures in a complementary fashion.	0.45320881873591756
Combining both techniques yields the best results in the diagnosis of osteoporosis.	0.6225664071270457
Classification of cosmetics, which are more and more similar to topical therapeutic agents, is getting increasingly difficult for dermatologists.	0.7238051449931775
Their definition within the EU and the respective European directives, replacing national laws step by step, will be briefly presented.	0.3611510699759853
The problems of distinguishing cosmetics from medicinal products will be discusssed in detail by examples from clinical practice.	0.3630223739898042
Finally, we will review the various active substances which tend to be added to cosmetics following the global trend in the cosmetic industry towards developing "medicinally" active cosmetics, and in the pharmaceutical industry towards "cosmetically" oriented medicinal products as part of a current "life-style" ideology.	0.6153193282680485
In some clinical dermatological fields these active substances may allow the dermatologists to use cosmetics as topical therapeutic agents.	0.41622014814763675
The decision whether a rotator cuff tear has a traumatic or degenerative origin still causes some controversy.	0.3697702520177817
Especially in medical expert appraisements the etiology of the rotator cuff tear plays an important role refering to insurance services for the patient.	0.5458832421928662
The purpose of this paper is to compare the intraoperative pathomorphologic shape of the cuff tear in traumatic and degenerative cases.	0.6435583511264658
This study reports of 56 patients with rotator cuff tears which were devided in primarily acute, subacute traumatic and degenerative study groups refering to their history of present illness.	0.49350397151226155
We considered the location of the tear, the shape and the size.	0.6751351784115163
Furthermore the grade of retraction of the supraspinatus tendon, its quality and the shape of the long head of biceps were examined.	0.5857668083711397
The results showed that in general the shape of the tear gives only in some cases significant information whether the etiology is traumatic or not.	0.7012022188375411
The isolated rupture of the subscapularis muscle and the hematoma at the edge of the tendon is siginificant for the trauma.	0.5067798099897814
In comparison with the degenerative study group the tenosynovitis and the dislocation of the long head of biceps is in our study sigificant for traumatic tears.	0.6566738871960692
Health care decision making in incompetent severely ill patients presents many difficult medical, ethical, and legal problems for the physician.	0.5446029077096682
At the same time nurses represent the group of medical professionals who have the closest contact with the patient and who have to carry out most of the decisions and instructions.	0.7401984832678098
Barber's disease is produced by short hairs that penetrate the interdigital spaces of the hands.	0.4798557465466267
The following chronic inflammatory reaction causes fistulas or sinuses and cysts.	0.3907532776274285
We present the case of a patient with interdigital pilonidal sinuses of all web spaces in both hands.	0.5132054108737382
Such an extensive case of this occupational disease has so far not been reported.	0.5190084004473371
The treatment of critically ill patients compromises frequently between an adequate fluid resuscitation for maintenance of a sufficient regional perfusion on the one hand and the avoidance of pulmonary edema on the other hand.	0.5705573662280018
The application of the transpulmonary indicator dilution method allows the orientation of fluid therapy by using the parameters 'intrathoracic blood volume' and 'extravascular lung water'.	0.4995835097844603
This technique is less invasive than the pulmonary artery catheter since it only needs a 3 or 4 French catheter in the femoral artery.	0.6168887403454039
Additionally, controlling the fluid therapy with the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is severely limited in the mechanically ventilated patient.	0.44574474695133365
Therefore, the intrathoracic blood volume may be of advantage in the critically care patient in comparison to the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure to assess the cardiac preload.	0.6908669002548786
Furthermore, the indocyanine clearance adds a valuable parameter to assess liver function when the double indicator technique is used.	0.47351062204126415
Hypnosis, autogenic training, progressive relaxation and biofeedback show good empirical evidence concerning relaxation-therapy and are useful techniques in psycho- or behavior-therapy.	0.5513837808005693
Though they share some aspects with body-oriented psychotherapy these relaxation-techniques show a modern scientific orientation and are therefore to seperate from religious meditation.	0.4305049955558441
Though in details somewhat different, the methodology of these techniques creates a framework, in which the psychophysiological determined relaxation response is easily elicited.	0.6899466466825771
However, regular practice of the patients is requiered.	0.8633267325438659
Focussed attention, imagination and new attributions of bodily or mental perceptions play a dominant role concerning the therapeutic effects, which may contribute to enhanced internal selfcontrol and selfesteem.	0.5643320711591168
Controlled clinical studies give evidence to positive effects concerning various psychosomatic disorders (e.g.	0.3315157391718876
headache, pain, ess.	0.5759998462460102
hypertension), as well as anxiety and sleeping disorders.	0.4111319283387542
As components of psychotherapeutic or behavioral programs, there is even more evidence for effects of relaxation in a broad spectrum of disorders (e.g.	0.4834589304612688
Relaxation therapy is a well established and scientific-based component in the treatment of psychic, psychosomatic or psychiatric disorders, except psychosis.	0.6602972078870034
Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis is a rare autosomal recessive connective tissue disease first described in 1873 by Murray.	0.5647245117192738
Major diagnostic criteria are multiple cutaneous tumors and gingival hypertrophy; minor criteria include contractures, osteolytic lesions and a positive family history.	0.4758152513590911
A 35-year-old woman suffering from Crohn's disease for 3 years developed painful erythematous nodular lesions predominantly on the dorsa of her hands and feet, as well as on her elbows and wrists.	0.5272660205163091
The clinical features and histopathological picture of leukocytoclastic vasculitis were both highly suggestive of erythema elevatum diutinum.	0.46721940379232585
No improvement of the skin lesions was observed during treatment with high doses of oral steroids.	0.936934632880813
In contrast, treatment with dapsone resulted in a marked reduction of skin lesions.	0.6404636182929133
During a new attack of her Crohn's disease the erythema elevatum diutinum lesions flared again.	0.4077694009805505
The parallel clinical course of erythema elevatum diutinum and Crohn's disease, as well as the detection of immune complexes and neutrophilic granulocytes in lesions of both diseases, strongly suggest a common etiology.	0.5403356515764178
This hypothesis is discussed in context with this case and the recent literature.	0.7199728020165955
The mammalian brain is capable of a substantial functional reorganization, manifesting on a cortical somatotopical and on a behavioral level.	0.38353093974351454
Possible mechanisms are reviewed based on the work by others and ourselves on somatosensory reorganization in humans.	0.4554049945605928
The somatosensory system is characterized by divergent projections from the periphery to the cerebral cortex.	0.44751302225100825
Changes in synaptic weights allow for reorganization of sensory processing: On one side, limb amputation will result in a representational "invasion" of the deafferentated cortex from neighboring regions with concomitant perceptual changes.	0.4687203416142423
On the other side, sensorimotor training can increase the representational cortical zone of a limb.	0.5978415813968218
Plastic changes can be temporary or persistent.	0.24113577811191686
Modulating factors like pain and certain drugs seem to induce a permissive state in the cortex resulting in enhanced reorganization.	0.4289173399665272
Thus, specific physical training combined with pharmacoceutical modulation holds promise to improve functional recovery after brain lesions.	0.49337390160067296
There have been some prospective randomized studies which compared primary angioplasty with intravenous thrombolysis in patients with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI).	0.5502712078428247
However, a substantial number of patients with AMI who would not have been included in those trials are treated with one of these two therapeutic options.	0.786091562590714
To describe the proportions, characteristics, and outcome of these patients treated with primary angioplasty or thrombolysis we analyzed the data of the prospective "Maximal Individual Optimized Therapy for Acute Myocardial Infarction" (MITRA) trial.	0.7402152601289822
Chronic infectious diseases may run over many months and years, accompanied by only mild clinical signs and often without organ-specific symptoms.	0.44194350265365256
People with any kind of immuno deficiency are more frequently affected by chronic infections.	0.3858307526501864
History, physical examination, laboratory tests, microbiological tests and imaging methods may lead to an exact diagnosis.	0.6842113907669589
The most important differential diagnosis are autoimmune diseases, amyloidosis and malignant lymphoma.	0.5469954603063313
Background: We perform partial sphincterectomy during cataract surgery in cases with very small pupil (< 3 mm).	0.7240243532835456
We assume that the small pupil is mainly due to a fibrosis ring of the sphincter muscle.	0.5011102275461821
Trauma scores in emergency medicine quantitatively characterise the severity of trauma victims' injuries and physiologic derangements.	0.492203622228245
They are used to detect and assess patients and have applications in guiding patient care and early therapeutic decisions.	0.5522206259398974
In the pre-clinical setting, an effective trauma index meets the following criteria: - It is highly reliable with regard to identifying high- and low-risk patients.	0.7612084364854773
- It has high face-validity.	0.678791656004811
- It has high inter- and intra-rater reliability.	0.7452311531645369
- It is easy to use and allows rapid, accurate measurements.	0.7100314762697019
The most widely accepted injury severity index is probably the Injury Severity Score (ISS).	0.6016360011087596
It is calculated as the sum of the squares of the three most severely injured body regions, and was originally developed as a means to standardise the description of injuries sustained in motor vehicle accidents.	0.6146269654939829
The Trauma Score (TS) represents the gold standard of physiologic scoring of injury severity.	0.49388365873994183
It summarises the numerical assessments of the central nervous and cardiopulmonary system functions.	0.45346714309106456
The recently developed Mainz Emergency Evaluation Score (MEES) is based upon numerical specification of the vital signs, including a pain scale, and has been designed as a dynamic score.	0.765939195346833
Nevertheless, limitations of the established trauma score systems have been described.	0.5907026888034174
Mortality and patient outcome do not strictly correlate with injury severity scoring.	0.4059316580866542
In addition, intubated or paralysed patients were excluded from outcome studies since the scoring systems lacked options for evaluation of pathophysiological conditions after therapeutic interventions.	0.40988504059428355
Thus, therapeutic efficacy could hardly be assessed, and subsequent scoring during time periods was impossible.	0.5503224449372384
The accurate definition of comprehensive evaluation of a trauma victim is challenging, for example, "pain" as chosen in the MEES must be regarded as a highly desirable piece of information although its rating may prove difficult, especially when classifying unconscious patients.	0.6564355368225614
Further criticisms of the above-mentioned trauma indices could include omission of the trauma victim's age, gender, pre-injury health status, or the influence of alcohol or additional medication.	0.563926857791627
Moreover, questioning the interrater reliability of injury severity scoring, a recent study revealed bias in assigning values to trauma patients: trained raters classified injury severity with significantly higher indices than less experienced researchers.	0.46355696265345625
If trauma indices in pre-hospital emergency medicine were relied upon as the only means of evaluating a trauma patient and guiding therapeutic approaches, significant numbers of trauma victims requiring major interventions would be missed.	0.5134540938513111
Resuscitative treatment regimens must not be based solely upon indices, since, e.g., in states of shock injury scores do not correlate with fluid resuscitative requirements.	0.5757828368462381
Furthermore, a qualitative assignment of single vital-function parameters as crucial indices for a patient's condition never reflects the broad range of a patient's profile.	0.6983904747634591
Many multiple-trauma patients do benefit from controlled ventilation in clinical experience even though pulse oximetry values are within the physiological range, and the administration of analgesics or even pre-hospital anaesthesia has often proved advantageous for trauma patients in the field.	0.6742839163003526
Providing the opportunity of subsequent patient evaluation and the efficacy of acute care, the MEES has been developed as a dynamic scoring system.	0.6613078900278354
This design is extremely desirable and must be regarded as an indispensible criterion for future scoring systems.	0.41265044225701836
In view of the peculiarities of field emergency medicine, pre-hospital indices do have limitations.	0.44356493002754493
The parameters "unknown patient", time pressure, unprecise measurements, lack of diagnostic facilities, incomplete evaluation, and limited statistical power cannot be eliminated.	0.521375155589113
Accurate prediction of outcome within early time-frames is therefore not possible.	0.32106414651790766
Ossification of the Achilles tendon is the result of a traumatic, hypoxic injury of the tendon.	0.6863833993543325
The usually asymptomatic ossification has a clinical importance only in case of a new trauma.	0.6233753539146956
We report about a patient with an isolated fracture of the ossification without an accompanying rupture of the Achilles tendon.	0.6976303541233507
Because of the radiologically "occult" fracture the diagnosis could only be verified by MRI.	0.5310019762022782
With a conservative treatment without resection of the ossification we could reach painless recovery.	0.5371379160647896
Hair problems are attacked at the levels of information supply, trichological competence and evidence based medical treatment.	0.35607353702988037
The alopecias represent a major health care challenge, and the psychological significance of hair loss has only recently found appreciation in the medical community.	0.6517988174423918
They may pose a vexing problem for non-specialized physicians, who tend to trivialize such complaints, although the patient's perception of abnormality determines whether or not advice is sought.	0.6006549969012583
Perception of a hair problem is subject to sociocultural standards; films and advertisements help determine the threshold for "normality" and what is "healthy" and "beautiful", and the media provide an abundance of undiscriminating information with respect to hair care.	0.6082905525215405
Patients with hair problems frequently consult the hairdresser prior to the medical specialist.	0.48698400820504845
Thus additional areas of competence should be incorporated into the hairdresser's training qualifications.	0.33835919495490163
Besides manual, creative and psychological aptitudes, "trichological competence" relating to the recognition of most important hair disorders, recognition of personal limitations and cooperation with the medical specialist are required.	0.5621762616283291
To optimize the interaction between the physician, hairdressers and the media, more effective communication and public activities from the medical profession are desirable, with success depending on full identification of the set goals, qualification and adherance to the standards determined by the medical speciality.	0.6153529235416055
We reexamined biopsy and resection specimens from seven patients with histologically established primary diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) which showed previously undetected adenocarcinomatous differentiation after chemotherapy.	0.5855024483908268
Adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in the same part of the lung as was SCLC before treatment in five cases and in contralateral location in two.	0.7383754969813536
Two tumors showed heterogeneous differentiation with small-cell and adenocarcinomatous components, and five had only adenocarcinoma.	0.6359386650910503
The interval between histological evidence of SCLC and adenocarcinoma was 3 months-5 years.	0.5232353364787394
From the specific findings in the respective patients we can offer two possible explanations for changing differentiation in SCLC after chemotherapy: (a) a primarily heterogeneously differentiated tumor with selection of adenocarcinomatous component under chemotherapy, and (b) an independently developed adenocarcinoma after successful chemotherapy of SCLC, as patients with treated SCLC are known to have an increased risk of non-SCLC.	0.6582652068628311
However, therapy-induced alteration of differentiation seems much more unlikely.	0.5713349084350218
These findings should be considered in diagnosis and therapy of SCLC to allow early and appropriate reaction to non-SCLC components.	0.6413245889441211
Demonstration of BDV-specific serum antibodies, the isolation of BDV from cerebrospinal fluid of neuropsychiatric patients, and the recent demonstration of BDV antigen and BDV-RNA in human brain tissue strongly suggest that BDV can infect humans.	0.6104403421427569
Isolation of BD virus from brain tissue is needed for final proof.	0.38247667581836997
There is still great controversy about the question of whether BDV antigen, BDV-RNA or BDV can be detected in peripheral blood monocytes or not.	0.6133911878092301
Overall, the question of pathogenicity of BDV infection for humans is wide open.	0.5500633033646884
Investigations of human cerebrospinal fluid indicate that BDV might cause human lymphocytic meningoencephalitis and so-called symptomatic psychoses in rare cases.	0.347104087179939
Seroepidemiological studies suggest a widely non-specific but possibly pathogenic role of BDV in a spectrum of psychiatric disorders.	0.555804251067108
In a controlled prospective study we compared the efficacy of combined salt water bath and UVA/B phototherapy to a UVA/B mono-phototherapy in patients with subacute atopic dermatitis (AD).	0.5084586249339561
The patients in the balneophototherapy group (n=16) were treated with baths containing 3-5% of the synthetic salt Psori-sal, followed immediately by UVA/B irradiation, while the other treatment arm (n=12) received UVA/B phototherapy alone.	0.7561952528715583
After 20 treatments the balneophototherapy group showed a statistically significant (p<=0.0015) reduction of the SCORAD score from 69.5 before to 36.8 after therapy.	0.6109678670737596
No statistically significant reduction in the SCORAD score could be observed in the UVA/B phototherapy group (50.6 before to 44.3 after therapy).	0.7460256789777463
The cumulative UVB dose was significantly lower in the balneophototherapy group (0.9 J/cm2) as compared to the UVA/B monotherapy group (2.0 J/cm2).	0.7287495917768323
Balneophototherapy was well tolerated by patients with atopic dermatitis and no side effects were observed.	0.5865895425131221
We conclude that balneophototherapy expands the therapeutic options for patients with subacute atopic dermatitis.	0.514118308327215
Five percent of all human tumors are found in the head and neck region with an increasing rate.	0.6361437929670732
Head and neck tumors are not only a significant problem because of the large number of people affected.	0.8675258438313197
The functional and cosmetic disadvantages and stigmas related to the therapy influence the medical recommendations for each individual patient.	0.5941315272287502
Background and purpose: Only a few clinical reports about the routine use of intravenous rt-PA for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke have been published.	0.7168258184935226
Wether the perfusion of the extracranial parts of the internal carotid artery influences the outcome of the patients is still unknown, because the two major studies about systemic thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA in stroke (ECASS and NINDS) did not formally assess the status of the extracranial vessels.	0.7375776677131991
Introduction: Chronic pain is an individually variable experience, incorporating physical, psychological and social dimensions.	0.6220522799904986
Chronic pain occurs in a broad spectrum of severity; therefore, a grading procedure is of crucial importance in clinical research and in epidemiologic studies.	0.5981366308187246
It is mandatory to differentiate between traumatic and atraumatic instability when treating shoulder instability.	0.4710827266849471
The traumatic instability is characterized by secondary lesions (Bankart lesion, Hill-Sachs lesion, overstretching of the capsule), which are caused at the time of primary dislocation.	0.6664943858060096
The quality of the capsule has to be considered in close relationship to the appearance of the Bankart lesion.	0.862509129881532
The stronger the capsule, the greater the external force has to be in order to surmount the resistance caused by the capsule.	0.6309663591093118
The damage to the glenoid rim makes it possible to draw conclusions about the condition of the capsule.	0.6076486231836341
In cases of atraumatic instability, secondary lesions are normally absent.	0.4880501411345878
These instabilities are often caused by laxity of the capsule.	0.3288678325494346
When stabilizing, a shoulder two criteria have to be taken into consideration: stability and function.	0.5925023830693429
Reattachment of the labrum alone will not guarantee stability.	0.42450587816274943
Additionally, the overstretched capsule has to be shortened or shifted.	0.5324265172079193
Both criteria are decisive for the success of the stabilizing operation.	0.5037577966230887
In benign goiter, thyroidectomy is only indicated in patients with nodular alterations of the complete thyroid gland.	0.5230910055283717
There is no evidence indicating that total thyroidectomy could improve the postoperative results in patients with Graves' disease.	0.6481501086232003
In Germany, thyroidectomy with cervicocentral lymph node dissection is the standard procedure for all differentiated thyroid carcinomas.	0.6293055734007695
However, there are no data to prove that this approach is superior to less radical procedures.	0.7976564945017058
Avoidance of reoperations and optimal conditions for effective postoperative radioiodine therapy are arguments for this aggressive strategy.	0.36595638518679463
In patients with medullary carcinoma or with detected ret-proto-oncogene mutations, thyroidectomy with cervicocentral lymphadenectomy should be the initial operation.	0.5153279806197525
The cervicolateral and mediastinal compartments should be dissected when clinically obvious lymph node metastases are present in patients with differentiated carcinomas.	0.4877564510839825
In patients with medullary carcinomas, persistently increased calcitonin levels after the initial operation are sufficient indication for this procedure.	0.5808538195361913
Thyroidectomy is an important part of the multimodal approach in patients with anaplastic carcinomas.	0.6231736611148612
The operative technique of thyroidectomy is presented as well as the technique of cervical lymphadenectomy in consideration of the lymphatic drainage of the thyroid gland.	0.772478385499975
Tyrosinemia type I is an autosomal recessively inherited deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase resulting in accumulation of tyrosin and its degradation products (succinylacetoacetone mainly).	0.37900708255196075
Typical clinical features include liver and kidney failure as well as central nervous system involvement.	0.5204833968887123
There are three main forms of the disease: the acute form with manifestation in newborn infants and the subacute and the chronic form in children older than one year of age.	0.6065945579337527
Experimental data and clinical as well as postmortem experiences have indicated that subdural hematomas are less frequent in acceleration injuries in traffic accidents compared to falls or assaults.	0.4585691428461623
The present report demonstrates that this does not hold true in the same way for bridging vein ruptures (one of the predominant causes for subdural bleedings).	0.6196583260665308
Ruptures of these vessels without subdural bleeding (SDB) are only seldom mentioned in the literature.	0.5497369167328812
However, if no SDB is present, no one will look for these structures.	0.6882315142341032
In our institute a systematic analysis of the bridging veins in all cases of lethal blunt head injury is made: prior to the careful morphological preparation we investigate these vessels by radiographic imaging after filling with contrast medium.	0.5375204516821971
6 car passengers (age between 4 and 31 years) which suffered a lethal head injury were examined in the last year.	0.8140296061140083
2 victims had impressed fractures with cerebral compression injuries.	0.2703337992621864
In 1 case the base of the skull was broken and in 3 cases no skull fracture was present; no serious focal brain injury had occured in these 4 cases, but 3 victims had signs of diffuse brain injury.	0.6412142615625753
In 5 cases a direct impact of the head against the interior of the car was obvious.	0.7076203796913904
In 5 cases ruptures of serveral bridging veins could be demonstrated.	0.43713571110814536
In one case (survival for 3 days) a minor SDB (20 ml) was present and the ruptures had been closed by thrombosis; another victim died at the scene.	0.8084399043845762
The other 3 victims survived between 4 and 15 hours without developing SDB and without closing of the ruptures by thrombosis.	0.41331738969267956
This combination is surprising and shows that our knowledge concerning the relationship between bridging vein ruptures and SDB is restrictred.	0.4933176832893622
The frequency of bridging vein lesions in severe head injuries is likely underestimated in the clinical as well as in the postmortem literature.	0.6985125534197767
A rapid increase of intracranial pressure after the accident resulting in a collapse of the cerebral circulation is probably responsible for the absence of the SDB in the presented cases.	0.7303421924992703
Implantable hearing aids can form the basis of new surgical techniques for dealing with hearing problems originating in the inner ear, provided they are fully implantable.	0.50363856372665
Accordingly, a comprehensive, interdisciplinary, combined project was initiated at the ENT clinic of the University of Tübingen which was to conclude with operations to improve hearing via fully implantable hearing aids.	0.598309703301842
A novel electromechanical transducer for implantable hearing aids based on the piezoelectric principle is described.	0.4636992043220308
Unlike the piezoelectric transducers reported so far, this transducer does not rely on the bimorphic principle but on a circle-shaped, heteromorphic combination system consisting of a piezoceramic disc and metal membrane.	0.4149672613547033
The transducer can be hermetically sealed and is designed for implantation into the mastoid.	0.36648461919152464
Transfer of mechanical oscillations to an ossicle in the middle ear is effected by a directly fixed coupling rod or via suitable coupling elements.	0.43595675403595
The transducer is highly tuned with a resonance frequency at the upper end of the spectral transfer range (greater than 10 kHz).	0.5115355623362079
Below this resonance and down to low frequencies, the frequency response of elongation is smooth with amplitudes of around 20 nm.	0.4931980715842859
At low and middle frequencies of up to 1 kHz, these vibration amplitudes correspond to sound-pressure levels of around 90 dB SPL.	0.5588182576408988
At higher frequencies of up to 10 kHz, the output level increases to about 130 dB SPL.	0.6191934445869401
Nonlinear distortions are also very small at the highest levels (less than 0.1%) throughout the whole transfer range.	0.5048774025784959
Electric power consumption at maximum levels is in the range of a few microwatts and is therefore significantly lower than that of electromagnetic systems.	0.5791743694607976
Particularly, this makes it possible to use the transducer in fully implantable hearing aids for rehabilitation of sensorineural hearing loss.	0.6248738501460873
In craniomaxillofacial traumatology, surgical oncology and craniomaxillofacial reconstruction, a surgeon's aim may interfere with the prechiasmatic visual pathway.	0.5591374135911095
Precise concepts and therapeutic strategies are mandatory to detect and deal with anterior visual pathway disorders.	0.5850153784204785
In order to develop these strategies, knowledge of the pathomechanisms of potential optic nerve trauma, primary radiological investigations, and further diagnostic measures are important.	0.720148165966678
Due to the difficulties in neuroophthalmological testing of visual pathway functioning in severely injured patients or even during craniomaxillofacial reconstructions, we established flash-evoked visual potentials (VEP) and the electroretinogram (ERG) as reliable electrophysiological methods to gather specific information as to whether the visual pathway function is intact, even if pathological, but still present or absent.	0.6593102448901947
Case reports show that subjectively or objectively confirmed unilateral amaurosis does not neccessarily mean irreversible vision loss.	0.26554283489472774
The electrophysiological evaluation together with multiplanar computer tomography (CT) are important for the immediate identification of optic nerve trauma.	0.606622280395309
The results of this evaluation will provide the diagnostic information on whether surgical intervention and/or conservative therapy is required to prevent secondary optic nerve damage.	0.6842598054966536
The conservative therapy of choice for the treatment of traumatic optic nerve lesions is the methylprednisolone-megadosis regimen (30 mg Urbason/kg bodyweight i.v.	0.6055256684591337
and 5.4 mg/kg bodyweight/h i.v.	0.7063883451148947
for the following 47 h).	0.388062027606952
Surgical therapy involves decompression of the orbital compartment in case of retrobulbar hematoma or decompression of the intracanalicular part of the optic nerve in the traumatized optic canal or posterior orbit as confirmed by CT.	0.4726244759439689
Prospective analysis of our trauma patients and the international literature on traumatic optic nerve lesions show that the time factor in when to start therapy has been greatly underestimated.	0.7274310975309791
To fulfill modern treatment concepts in craniomaxillofacial surgery, sound diagnostic and therapeutic knowledge on the maintenance of visual pathway function is required.	0.5594343408745249
In the presence of preterm labor, premature rupture of the membranes, and preterm maturation of the cervix, there is an increased risk for premature birth.	0.7652086809370915
There is a combination of endocrine as well as paracrine regulations which are responsible for the events associated with preterm labor, maturation of the cervix, and preterm rupture of the membranes.	0.6408061846721572
Apart from classical hormones, various pro-inflammatory cytokines act as mediators.	0.49653354014282053
At the fetal-maternal interface - which is formed by the placenta with the chorioamnion on the fetal side and the decidua, myometrium, and the cervix on the maternal side - an intense interaction between endocrine and immunological reactions has been observed.	0.6477567900385921
Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a hormone with multiple functions in humans, produced by the pineal gland and stimulated by -adrenergic receptors.	0.6829428778656073
Serum melatonin levels exhibit a circadian rhythm with low levels during the day, rise in the evening and maximum levels at night between 2 and 4 a.m.. Melatonin participates in the regulation of several physiological processes such as seasonal biological rhythm, daily sleep induction, aging and modulation of immunobiological defence reactions.	0.4728633320707947
Furthermore, melatonin has a highly lipophilic molecular structure facilitating penetration of cell membranes and serving as an extra- and intracellular free radical scavenger.	0.485050158316664
Melatonin seems to quench mainly hydroxyl radicals, the most damaging of all free radicals.	0.559593725054541
Melatonin may play a role in the etiology and treatment of several dermatoses e.g.	0.6168118185126908
atopic eczema, psoriasis and malignant melanoma.	0.42010416916031423
The influence of melatonin on hair growth is another aspect.	0.4425142220987015
Topical application of melatonin inhibits the development of UV-erythema.	0.4538103258918755
Penetration through skin after topical application and oral bioavailability auxit further investigations on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic actions of melatonin.	0.3278168420232622
Lung dust analyses were performed on tumor-free lung tissue from surgical samples of 28 carcinoid tumors.	0.533629802319713
The measured levels in one surgical sample may easily be correlated with the increased asbestos load of the lung due to the patients' occupation as stone mason.	0.6716915352494081
No evidence supporting the correlation of increased chronic asbestos load of the lungs and the development of typical carcinoid tumors of the lung was found.	0.6563538404088204
Analysis of 147 repeat arthroscopies of the knee performed at the Department of Surgery at the Herz-Jesu Krankenhaus, Fulda, from 1990 to 1995, showed that meniscal lesions were the most common (n = 89, 60.5%).	0.677033392807469
The majority of meniscal lesions (n = 45, 50.6%) occurred in menisci that had already been partially resected.	0.6421209300786979
The most common localization was the posterior third of the medial meniscus in ipsilateral lesions.	0.6955649629582353
Conversely, contralateral meniscal injuries were only documented in 18 cases (20.2%), while de-novo lesions occurred in 29 cases (29.2%).	0.6404173164236124
A coincidence of meniscal injury with first- or second-grade cartilage damage was documented  in 35 patients (39.3%), whereas 54 patients (60.7%) had normal intra-articular cartilage.	0.7603489450778252
Cartilage damage was most frequent in patients who had previously undergone partial meniscectomy.	0.7312780856187653
The most common therapeutic consequences were partial meniscectomy and cartilage-shaving.	0.5359737885787138
Concerning patients' postoperative satisfaction and evaluation of the results by OAK score, the majority of patients attained significant improvement in function (65.2%) and showed good or excellent outcome in the OAK score (88.8%).	0.7625967089243637
Patients without accompanying cartilage damage had better results in comparison to patients with cartilage damage in the affected area (p < 0.05).	0.5354035529381845
In conclusion, in patients with positive meniscal signs and a history of previous meniscal surgery, repeat arthroscopy is generally and early indicated and can be recommended as a valid method to assess cartilage damage objectively.	0.6531443387147886
However, patients with cartilage damage do not have the same benefit.	0.7074488488631535
The present study examined the effectiveness of combined dermatological and behavioural medicine therapy on the skin status and disease-specific stress of eighty-six patients with psoriasis and fifty-eight patients with atopic dermatitis who were hospitalized in the PsoriSol Clinic, Hersbruck, Germany.	0.6537081643905773
In addition to receiving instruction about their stain disease, the patients were offered, practice in relaxation techniques, social contacts and scratching control as well as individual psychological counselling.	0.6665351467256
The clinical change was assessed by PASI and SCORAD, respectively.	0.4109388679483677
The Marburg questionnaire for coping with skin diseases (MHF) and a questionnaire for health-related control attributes (GKÜ-S) served as psychometric measures.	0.6169202090190261
Patients showed significant improvement in skin status and psychosocial parameters in pre-post comparison.	0.47816983909058164
Social fears, avoidance and helplessness were reduced by significant improvement of the emotional status in both groups.	0.5066741440283083
Patients with psoriasis also showed an increase in internal control attributes.	0.5238948808235645
Dermatological treatment combined with behavioural medicine therapy can be considered an effective method in patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.	0.6602313113009076
Treatment of chronic cancer pain with strong opioids is indicated in about 60-70 % of patients.	0.7591209081669797
Surprisingly, these very potent analgesics are prescribed with great reservations in many countries, including Germany.	0.584618935000678
The aim of our investigation was to analyse the supply of opioid analgesics to outpatients with cancer pain in the region of Hannover, which has about 1.1 million inhabitants.	0.8978554342788541
In Germany special prescription forms, i. e. triplicate forms, have to be used for the prescription of strong opioids.	0.7243808239671358
At the time when our investigation took place prescriptions for outpatients had to be renewed every 7 days.	0.5443599166404942
For two observation periods of 6 months lasting from January to June 1988 and from January to June 1991 all of the opioid prescription forms that had been issued by general practitioners for clients of the AOK Hannover (one of the major medical insurance companies) were evaluated.	0.6658093837976394
The reasons for prescribing opioids were analysed by recording the diagnosis.	0.46003715784843263
The individual treatment period on an outpatient basis during these 6 months was determined, excluding, e. g. days of hospitalization.	0.5890784724891636
During the two observation periods only 16.2 % (1988) and 19.5 % (1991) of the practitioners in the region of Hannover prescribed strong opioids to outpatients.	0.7404869600228354
The majority of the practitioners consisted of general practitioners and specialists in internal medicine.	0.5871144215998179
Although these two groups mainly function as family doctors who are responsible for the basic therapeutical needs of their patients, only 22.6-33.8 % of these doctors prescribed opioids to outpatients.	0.6925672998826622
In two-thirds of the patients, cancer pain was the reason for prescribing the drug.	0.5593538175609617
The total number of patients with a prescription for cancer pain was 164 in 1988 and 196 in 1991.	0.6433031326672054
Altogether 1002 prescription forms in 1988 and 1065 prescription forms in 1991 had been issued for these patients.	0.4664640372033806
Applied to the individual treatment period as an outpatient, only 36.0 % of the patients in 1988 and 32.1 % in 1991 received a regular prescription of strong opioids every 7 days.	0.8653968427309878
The mean time interval between separate prescriptions was 16.8  +/-  25.4 days in 1988 and 19.4  +/-  29.1 days in 1991.	0.8461214932119199
Accordingly, the majority of patients with chronic cancer pain had been supplied with opioids only occasionally.	0.7477934791317162
Our data indicate a significant undertreatment of outpatients suffering from cancer pain.	0.4308434966448584
Taking into account the estimated total number of patients suffering from cancer, only 14.5 % (1988) and 19.0 % (1991) of all outpatients in need of strong opioids were supplied sufficiently with those analgesics.	0.8186706371750905
Comparing the results from the observation period in 1988 with the results from 1991 it becomes obvious that the situation has not changed.	0.7007934117768292
There are different reasons for the insufficiency of opioid treatment: many physicians as well as their patients are still afraid of the side effects of strong opioids.	0.6843887621141865
Therefore, it is necessary to improve education concerning this issue.	0.6868185125000619
The legal restrictions on the use of narcotics and their complexity are another important reason for doctors not to prescribe strong opioids.	0.3572772632181657
In 1993 the regulations were simplified; nevertheless, this has not led to a profound change in the attitude of the prescribing practitioners.	0.5964731194097713
Thus, further changes in legislation seem to be necessary so that the requirements for the prescription of strong opioids do not differ from other drugs.	0.678804567890949
The long-term functional results of acetabular fractures are assessed in terms of the corresponding criteria of Merle-D'Aubigné and Postel (pain, mobility, walking).	0.531168430029671
Other essential criteria include the quality of reduction and the radiological appearance.	0.5791893914086667
A 53 year old female patient developed a keratoacanthoma, present on the left side of her nose for two months.	0.6860840007768932
After repeated unsuccessful trials with cryotherapy, she was treated with intralesional injection of methotrexate performed twice with a weekly internal.	0.48014916358910115
This led to complete resolution within 5 weeks.	0.38511639647867774
Although controlled studies on the effect of methotrexate in keratoacanthoma are not available, the rapid regression and the good cosmetic result suggest that this therapy may play a beneficial role in treating these lesions especially in problem locations.	0.6347733146723438
Between January 1995 and June 1996, 24 inpatients at our hospital (mean age 55.6 years) were treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).	0.7356817309839796
Clinical improvement was observed in 80% of the patients, including those without risk factors (NRG, n=16), as well as those with concomitant cardiovascular diseases (RG, n=8).	0.6523121497026566
During a mean period of observation of 224 days after the end of ECT 7 patients (35%) relapsed.	0.6115931136414061
The rate of relapse was higher in RG than in NRG patients (57.1 vs 23.1%).	0.6154147320610348
In all cases ECT was well tolerated; 285 applications of ECT did not result in mortality or persistent morbidity.	0.5240543163828634
However, RG patients may be at increased risk for the development of minor cardiovascular complications, which were noted in three RG patients (37.5%), but only in one patient (6.2%) in the NRG (Fisher's test, P=0.09).	0.8169536807914521
Taken together, our results demonstrate that ECT is a safe treatment regimen for depression even in medically ill patients of old age.	0.5905660603814816
On 21.11.1811 the poet Heinrich von Kleist and his companion Henriette Vogel were found dead in a small hollow by the Wannsee.	0.3992821669792018
The autopsy revealed that Kleist was shot in the mouth and Vogel died from a close-contact shot to the chest.	0.39566037594275905
The tragedy, which was reflected in letters and documents ended in a suicide pact.	0.5413401570420056
The conclusions of the pathologists were influenced by current medical opinions which were based on interpretations of the ancient humoral doctrine of Hypocrates.	0.34214776079001674
Subjective and objective opinions were mixed together.	0.29440308003043636
Some forensic and historical aspects of this suicide pact are highlighted.	0.39215828543385883
There is no doubt that a single emergency phone number is desirable, but in contrast to other countries, in Germany different emergency phone numbers and dispatching centers exist for the fire brigade (FB), the emergency medical service system (EMS), and the general practitioners' emergency service (GPS).	0.7517799429607743
Due to this fact, valuable time is often wasted by connecting or transferring emergency calls from one dispatching center to another.	0.3792863592885845
The purpose of this study was to analyse all calls received by the different dispatching centers in the city and county area of Mainz with respect to total number, fraction of emergency calls, and specificity.	0.6692898769034876
Further, the total number of calls potentially referring to a hypothetic single dispatching center with a general emergency phone number (112) was calculated.	0.6598793781534257
During a 4-month period, all telephone calls were registered and related to day, time, and origin of the call (city or county) and classified as non-urgent or emergency calls, calls appropriate to the dispatching center dialed, emergency calls to be transferred, or unspecific calls.	0.6964665633406462
A total of 80 987 calls were received (city area 84.3%, county area 15.7%), most of them directed to the FB of Mainz (33 086).	0.6065010280931734
The EMS dispatching center received 31 286 calls, the five GPS-centers 15 256 calls; 1359 emergency calls that were directed to the police or FB needed transfer to the EMS.	0.4501793201181349
During weekdays the EMS and FB received the most calls, with a reduced frequency on Saturdays and Sundays (Table 2).	0.5561079659419194
Nevertheless, the highest total numbers of calls were received on Saturdays due to multiple calls directed to the GPS.	0.5340216662707115
The FB had the highest specificity of calls; more than 50% of the calls to the GPS were unspecific (Fig.	0.5892975313522002
Of all calls, 4.37% were classified as emergency calls; two-thirds of these came from the area of Mainz during the daytime.	0.6881947109884949
During off-duty hours of the GPS in the city, 51% of the emergency calls reached the EMS directly; 49% had to be connected by the police or FB.	0.6866978524907568
During duty hours of the GPS, the fraction of calls directed to the EMS decreased significantly to 35%.	0.5666330589089497
During duty hours of the GPS centers in the county area, only 14% of the urgent emergency calls reached the EMS dispatcher directly (Fig.	0.5632789257804367
Compared to the multiple-center mode, a hypothetic single dispatching center for all systems would probably be followed by a slight increase in total number of calls due to the fact that the GPS numbers would be answered 24 h a day, but there would be only minimal differences in the total number received on most days; only on Sundays would a decrease be expected.	0.6606904068071657
The EMS area of Mainz, with a total of 13 different telephone numbers for 7 dispatching centers, can be regarded as typical of the German situation.	0.7833878571397768
The high number of emergency calls to be transferred (up to 86% under special circumstances) demonstrated that this weak point in the German EMS system must be eliminated by introducing a single emergency number.	0.5818857246646257
This should occur when a Europe-wide three-digit number "112" will be instituted, probably in 1995.	0.44444656859011544
Additionally, the continued existence of 5- or 10-digit telephone numbers for non-urgent calls may be useful for allowing non-verbal differentiation of calls.	0.6878349173127762
In any case, all telephone numbers, including the latter calls, have to enter one dispatching center.	0.8560685890870908
The main advantage of a single dispatching center would be avoidance of the time-consuming transfer of emergency calls from one dispatching center to the other.	0.6397914299722202

Epidemiologic data suggest that an underlying genetic disposition can be detected in up to 10 % of all colorectal cancer patients and autosomal dominantly inherited hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is the entity most frequently identified.	0.7773337267421967
It was described first by A. Warthin in 1895 in "Family G" and is characterized by a predisposition to an early onset of colorectal cancer and other intestinal or genitourinary tumors.	0.6619771941516349
We report the case of a 61-year-old woman with five different cancers.	0.5586781842288112
Although the strict Amsterdam Criteria were not fulfilled, molecular analysis revealed HNPCC; further genetic testing in the family confirmed that the 36-year-old and so far healthy son had inherited the germline mutation of his affected mother.	0.50570896117584
Genetic testing in clinically suspected HNPCC cases is recommended for patients with colorectal cancer meeting the Amsterdam Criteria.	0.5855800118279616
In patients meeting one of Bethesda Criteria 2-7 without meeting the Amsterdam Criteria, germline mutation analysis is recommended only in MSI-positive tumors.	0.42927397972622117

The median palatine suture has long been regarded as having the greatest resistance to dilatation of the maxilla.	0.43198198979799535
In 1984 Glassman [3] presented a conservative-surgical method of division of the palatineal suture in which only the lateral and anterior support of the maxilla is debilitated surgically.	0.5424171872388652
An orthodontic apparatus cemented in place preoperatively is already used intraoperatively for dilatation of the maxilla.	0.37976485030846024
In the period from 1991 to 1997, 16 patients with a leptomaxilla and various dysnathic findings have been operated on at our clinic by the method described by Glassman [3].	0.7506207495382787
Sometimes the maxilla was dilated intraoperatively using the apparatus cemented in place by the method of Derichsweiler and dilatation was continued postoperatively until the described result was achieved.	0.4918191540687779
After successful dilatation of the maxilla and a stabilizing phase, a mono- or bimaxillary operation was performed.	0.7563987528635501
The use of this method led to the desired result in 15 patients.	0.8087903741432401
Dilatation of the maxilla was objectivized by determining the pre- and postoperative width of the anterior and posterior dental arch using models and X-ray of the occlusal overlay of the maxilla.	0.7171010116951266
In one patient who was operated on at the age of 38 years, a fracture of the alveolar process of the maxilla occurred unilaterally due to the completed ossification of the median palatine suture.	0.8072825103767453
The method of surgically aided dilatation of the maxilla at the level of Le Fort I plane is suitable for patients up to the age of 30.	0.6458062098895415

Pathogenesis: Arteriosclerosis and Mönckeberg's disease mediasclerosis are vascular diseases associated with calcification of the artery wall.	0.340076936335708
While mediasclerosis in most cases develops in type 2 diabetic patients, arteriosclerosis is the result of a combination of different vascular risk factors.	0.5687358805958184
Möncheberg's mediasclerosis typically involves the tunica media, whereas arteriosclerosis-associated calcifications primarily involve the intima.	0.4167142105533454
The new technique of non-invasive magnetic resonance (MR) sialography was evaluated for normal and various pathologic conditions of the parotid gland.	0.5519426160165458
Ten volunteers and 15 patients with various symptomatic diseases of the parotid gland were tested in the present study.	0.6317649413861225
Diseases included pleomorphic adenoma, cystadenolymphoma, carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma, ductal carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, lymphoepithelial carcinoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, sialolithiasis, sialadenitis, Heerfordt's syndrome and congenital duct ectasies.	0.40257505189947235
In addition to the usually performed T1 and T2 cross-sectional sequences a heavily weighted T2 sequence (TR 3600, TE 800) was performed and allowed depiction of a fluid-filled parotid duct.	0.5959661255586925
Results showed that the main parotid and primary branching ducts were depicted reliably in all normal cases and all patients, except one with sicca syndrome.	0.5663606693399718
Pathological conditions such as duct dilatations, duct strictures, obstructing duct calculus and irregular shapes and courses of the ductal system were demonstrable.	0.3384801030571311
While X-ray sialography obtained a higher resolution, only MR sialography was able to depict dilated ducts proximal from a complete obstruction, as well as all ductal cysts.	0.5103549292017666
Our findings show that MR sialography can be applied successfully to investigations of the parotid gland system.	0.49754960389314956
There have been no contraindications or complications to date because MR sialography is non-invasive.	0.5089728477186474
The technique will also allow the salivary ducts and lesions to be differentiated from the course of the facial nerve.	0.5748467813800909
Substantial improvement in conformal radiotherapy is possible using modulated irradiation fields.	0.33562670399335676
Such modulated fields may be generated even with conventional accelerators by means of individual metal compensators or with the recently available dynamic multileaf collimators (MLC).	0.35523535354138297
For treatment planning a new kind of planning program is required that can calculate the 2 D-intensity matrices for each photon field.	0.4229408495002305
At the German Cancer Research Center (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum) such a program has been developed under the name of "KonRad" (Conformal Radiotherapy).	0.6120699450675989
Although it is an independent application, it is proposed for clinical usage to supplement a planning system that is already present.	0.640634613303006
So-called inverse planning differs from conventional 3 D planning, as the trial-and-error approach for finding good field parameters is nearly completely avoided.	0.5317245643241338
Instead, the radio-oncologist is given the chance directly to specify medically oriented criteria like the prescription dose in the target volume, maximal tolerance dose values for each organ at risk and their weighting factors.	0.5594141825203732
In addition, the so-called DVH optimization allows aimed, partial overdosage, especially in parallelly structured organs in order to obtain better overall planning results.	0.5464139438939332
The Problem Six-year old boy with unilateral Type-II cleftfoot, oligodactyly and clinodactyly of the 2nd toe.	0.5912346909080449
The marked splaying of the forefoot not only causes painful pressure points but also problems with fitting of shoes.	0.40324747237917424
A child with typical signs of the cat eye-syndrom except the characteristic feature of a cat eye is reported.	0.44667798276779713
In a chromosome analysis (47,xx, + mar de novo) an extrachromosome was detected.	0.4232743773857136
Using fluorescence in situ hybridization the supernumerary marker refered to chromosome 22.	0.35951188422471697
In the literature only a few cases show all the characteristic features of cat eye syndrome.	0.7598109323411093
However, there are only two case reports of children without any ocular alterations.	0.8069447704907846
The great variability in the phenotype probably depends on different sizes of the marker chromosome or asymmetric breakpoints on the long arm of chromosome 22.	0.42489103186091637
According to new literature reports there is no correlation between the phenotypic variability and the size of the marker chromosome.	0.6119396854661608
Probably the degree of severity is correlated with the percentage of the patients lymphocytes that contain the extrachromosome.	0.6782478652556241
Introduction: Children with ALL frequently present with skeletal pain at the time of diagnosis.	0.6028955361996455
We retrospectively analyzed the incidence and clinical features of skeletal pain and the correlation between pain and radiographic findings.	0.7542749948199335
Objective: Elevated levels of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) have been reported after cardiac operation, during inflammatory process and cardiac allograft rejection.	0.7816828257414415
Although several groups proved the evidence of a negative inotropic effect, the actual mechanism is not completely understood.	0.673173366211024
Speaking generally it is possible that low molecular weight proteins are capable of altering myocardial contractility on the level of the contractile apparatus.	0.5142252704792064
Therefore this study analyzes whether IL-1 and/or IL-6 influence myocardial contractility on the level of the contractile apparatus.	0.6008918696223456
Methods: During aorto-coronary bypass operation, human muscle fibers were excised (n=32) and skinned using Triton-X-100.	0.5261927092904226
The experimental skinned fiber model excludes membrane-related factors such as receptor activation and provides direct examination of the contractile apparatus itself.	0.4364341225421964
Different concentrations of IL-1 and IL-6 were applied (pIL-1/IL-6 1-2x10-5-10-11M).	0.5675391687864323
Force generation, calcium sensitivity, and velocity of force generation and relaxation were measured.	0.5061074199383777
(Experiments were carried out at optimal length, bath temperature 23 °C, and isometric conditions.)	0.43168771792792154
Results: None of the skinned muscle preparations of the human myocardium showed under the given experimental setup a significant change in contractility and relaxation after exposure to IL-1 and IL-6.	0.5479432321524166
Despite using nonphysiologic concentrations of IL-1 and IL-6 (pIL-1/IL-6 10-5M) no significant effect occurred.	0.6186729733745311
Furthermore no difference in calcium-sensitivity of the contractile proteins following addition of IL-1 and IL-6 could be observed.	0.6427432246876684
Conclusions: Thus, there is no experimental evidence for direct modulation of the contractile apparatus by IL-1 or IL-6.	0.6590207858753634
Given these results it is possible to exclude some potentially negative inotropic cascades that are mediated on the level of the contractile apparatus as the molecular mechanism.	0.5113596617597519
These data show that therapies which support myocardial contractility during sepsis by stimulation of the contractile proteins do not seem to be very promising.	0.580468273680762
Indications for intercarpal and radiocarpal resectionarthroplasty and fusions are osteoarthritis, KIEHNBÖCK'S disease, rheumatoid arthritis and several posttraumatic disorders of the wrist joint.	0.42207723846677236
The resection of carpal bones leads to severe instability patterns of the wrist.	0.5701402865810108
In conclusion we recommend resection-arthroplasty just for treatment of the thumb carpo-metacarpal osteoarthritis.	0.5663785053189828
Implant resection arthroplasty of the lunate and scaphoid or total wrist implants are still causing multiple problems regarding heavy load.	0.43417977308222316
Therefore this implants should be confined to rheumatoid patients.	0.29181130287202006
Of the limited carpal arthrodeses the scaphotrapezium-trapezoid arthrodeses is the most frequent performed procedure.	0.4723403052832918
It can be indicated for STT-osteoarthritis, KIEHNBÖCK's disease, scapho-lunate instability and scaphoid pseudarthrosis if other surgical procedures had failed presuming there are no signs of arthrosis in the radiocarpal joint.	0.49123514631975623
Persisting pain especially in heavy work is quite frequent after limited arthrodesis but can be greatly releaved by simultaneous wrist denervation.	0.34879238453415806
In advanced cases of osteoarthritis total wrist arthrodesis is still the best choice for the patient.	0.6467487308804144
Increasing numbers of monitors at the anaesthesiologist's workplace, providing more than 20 different parameters of the patient's condition, have already made it impossible to record all the values in a handwritten form.	0.6803218763061968
Consequently, this most common method of record-keeping must be incomplete and inaccurate.	0.4910610379448463
In recent years computerised data-acquisition systems have been introduced into clinical practice in order to produce more reliable records.	0.6093207779689337
But after a 7-year experience in the use of such a system in cardiac anaesthesia, we have recognised certain problems that remain to be solved before automated record-keeping will achieve wider acceptance.	0.651643324145711
The first is the handling problem, which was discussed in a previous paper [11].	0.568308447059357
The second major problem is the appearance of artifacts, caused mainly by mechanical manipulations during the operation.	0.6128363550309145
In this paper, 300 courses of anaesthesia that were recorded on-line during different cardiac surgery procedures were examined and the incidence as well as the kind of artifacts occurring were evaluated.	0.611501245777437
Algorithms were developed for each haemodynamic parameter to suppress these artifacts automatically by a subsequent analysing process; the efficiency of that "artifact filter" was validated in 35 of the 300 cases.	0.5193945651057764
Based on more than 30,000 values for each parameter, the incidence of artifacts was 3%-7%.	0.7599794934144976
However, only 0.1%-0.5% of the artifacts could not be eliminated by the filter.	0.8282576963647922
The method described here provided acceptable graphic printouts of the most important haemodynamic parameters (Figs.	0.567635503272169
1b and 2b) and would also be suitable to serve as an input filter for automatically running anaesthesia data-examination processes, which are currently being developed in our clinic.	0.734939377112852
Extracorporal shock wave application (ESWA) has been used in the treatment of stones located in kidneys, bile, pancreas and the glandula parotis.	0.4927696213375012
In the last 2 years several studies have shown the benefit of the ESWA on the treatment of soft tissue disorders.	0.7324124941016789
The aim of this study was to explore the effect of high energy extracorporal shock waves in patients with painful calcaneus spurs.	0.5336738483246584
83 patients who underwent medicophysical treatment without benefit were treated with 3000 impulses of 0,30 mJ/mm2.	0.5175254162299313
Follow-ups after 12 weeks and 12 months showed that 51 of 83 patients became pain-free and 20 patients improved from the treatment.	0.6913159923940243
The results are showing the benefit of the high energy extracorporal shock wave application in the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis.	0.8337183553943742
In developed countries, medical conditions, rather than lack of food, are the main contributors to malnutrition.	0.697658375251191
Undernutrition is especially common in older persons, occuring in 5-12 % of community-dwelling older persons, in 30-61 % of hospitalized older persons, and in 40-85 % of persons in long-term care institutions.	0.8797974955888355
The multi-factorial nature of undernutrition in the elderly forces a structured differential diagnostic approach to determine underlying causes.	0.50582446947673
Heightened physician awareness of nutritional problems and prompt risk assessment is imperative to prevent the sequalae of undernutrition.	0.46953747246497063
This structured approach to the differential diagnosis is essential to evaluate potentially reversible causes of malnutrition.	0.6806754465484868
The number of surgical procedures performed as day surgery has significantly increased in recent years.	0.5735026824453296
Therefore, a safe and short postoperative recovery period has become increasingly important.	0.6561237425439895
The aim of the present study was to investigate perioperative cognitive and physiological function after oral premedication with low-dose midazolam (3.75 mg), especially during the postoperative period.	0.8575630454567748
Heart failure may be defined as a reduced physical per-formance frequently caused by a defect in myocardial contraction.	0.5916766485281602
According to the New York Heart Association, the severity of heart failure is classified into four grades (NYHA I-IV).	0.6293223757707092
Predominantly underlying causes are coronary artery disease, hypertension, cardiomyopathies and valvular heart diseases.	0.3982676032536361
Psychic disorders were studied with a naturalistic design in 125 consecutive patients of a medical-geriatric department in a general hospital.	0.5805278342381598
Based on the clinical examination and the values of the Mini-Mental-State-Examination (2), 51 patients were classified as unable for diagnostic procedures concerning psychic state.	0.6978986650134978
The other 74 patients underwent these diagnostic procedures including clinical investigation and three screening-scales (Geriatric Depression Scale (11); Hospital Anxiety and Depression-Scale (4)).	0.5366973995443562
If these examinations led to the suspicion that a patient suffered from a psychic disorder, an interview was performed by a psychotherapist with experience in gerontopsychosomatic treatment and information was collected from the medical and nursing staff.	0.741037876882314
Dementia was detected or excluded by neuropsychological tests.	0.26062163539143385
Psychic disorders were found in 41 patients, mostly adaptation disorders and depressions, the disorder was estimated to be relevant for the whole hospital therapy.	0.7462694367835889
The screening instruments turned out to be reliable, so they can be recommended for further use.	0.7175770104564397
Difficult to answer remains the question, how the treatment of the psychic disorders - in our sample necessary for each 5th to 6th patient - can be implemented in a medical-geriatric department.	0.7654530787140366
Based on the "Trauma Registry" of the German Society of Trauma Surgery, an interclinical quality management (QM) system was implemented.	0.7381685591326002
The principles of the QM system as well as the differences in the quality of outcome and treatment are presented.	0.7474911739566682
The analysis uses the data on 2,069 severely injured (ISS = 22  +/-  14) patients from 20 hospitals collected prospectively and anonymously between 2/93 and 12/97.	0.615106645818643
Outcome quality was analyzed by the TRISS method and Z-statistics.	0.4536800947756985
The Z-value of the whole series was -0.24.	0.6918770374132569
There were three hospitals with more than 150 patients that had a Ps value calculated by the TRISS method.	0.5603443013922184
Clinic A had a good (-2.49), clinic B an average (-0.3) and clinic C (3.62) an adverse Z-value.	0.8637773089174356
The assessment of treatment quality was performed by criteria concerning both preclinical and acute clinical phases.	0.5278336282577119
Clinic C had a prolonged preclinical treatment time (90 min vs 62 min in clinic A) for severely injured (ISS > 15) patients.	0.703555637500497
At the same time, the preclinical intubation rate for severe thoracic trauma (AIS > 3) was lower (44 %) in clinic C than in A (62 %).	0.8091044367182393
With 14 min clinic A had the shortest time until basic radiological and ultrasound diagnostics were completed (X-rays of chest and pelvis and abdominal ultrasound) in cases of severe blunt trauma (ISS > 15), compared to 54 min in clinic B or 31 min in clinic C. Also, cranial computed tomography for severe traumatic brain injury (GCS < 9) was applied significantly faster in clinic A (after 36 min) than in clinic C (after 62 min).	0.7331706989843041
Delayed diagnoses were defined as the difference between the ISS at discharge and the ISS at completion of diagnostics in the emergency department; this criterion was met best by clinic A with an ISS difference of two patients compared to five in clinic B and four in clinic C.	0.6415423236355354
For invasive catheter procedures both ionic and nonionic contrast media (CM) with excellent tolerability are available.	0.4957147701098399
The governing practical factors for CM are X-ray opacity and biocompatibility.	0.3872637293362072
Tolerability of a contrast medium is governed among its physical properties by its viscosity, osmolality, and ionic concentration.	0.5267302076719822
In Germany the nonionic CM are currently preferred.	0.39569014496394644
Because of its low thrombotic complications, the ionic CM Ioxaglat is an important alternative in high risk interventions.	0.7020036841007076
In patients with known CM incompatibility, the prophylactic application of H1-receptor antagonists and corticosteroids allows catheterization safely without complications.	0.5636421151948884
In impaired renal function, hydration is the most effective prophylactic measure to be taken.	0.6777204664434172
Background: In the present study we evaluated the influence of topical miotics on intraocular pressure and the blood-aqueous barrier after uncomplicated phacoemulsification and PC-IOL implantation.	0.6772136505624398
A judgement on the patient's quality of life cannot be based solely on the information about the clinical severity of a disease.	0.6650017793342984
Very often there is no correlation between these parameters.	0.5272120018334935
It is necessary to assess the quality of life by a health status question-naire since non-life threatening diseases common in dermatology influence the quality of life very much.	0.5735112660505214
The most frequently used questionnaires are the SF-36 and the Nottingham Health Profile.	0.5763751721442222
However, these forms do not evaluate all dermatologic patients adequately.	0.47719962606196886
Therefore specific tools such as the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index) and Skindex have been established for dermatology.	0.6006802947912413
Further disease-specific questionnaires have been created to mea-sure time related changes in dermatological patients.	0.44577020785702726
We surgically treated twenty patients with axillary hyperhidrosis by liposuction using tumescent regional anesthesia.	0.2808827535706554
After a description of the surgical technique results are presented.	0.8235658764769173
Except for trivial hematomas, no complications were seen.	0.6315036919182417
Every patient noted a significant reduction of sweat gland activity in the follow up period.	0.6055349051844682
Long-term results remain to be seen.	0.7494491711860344
The value of cytogenetics performed simultaneously with histopathology was evaluated in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).	0.4876760120927315
Clonal karyotype changes of the bone marrow cells supporting the histological diagnosis were found in 38/69 cases (55 %).	0.7596964185380084
The chromosome aberrations, especially complex changes, were significantly correlated to distinct histopathological findings such as atypias of the haematopoietic cell lines and myelosclerosis.	0.5933160755002037
Complex karyotype changes were further associated with short survival of the MDS patients.	0.4108525918665223
Our results demonstrate that cytogenetic analyses are helpful in supplementing the histopathological diagnoses.	0.34397417026302757
Recent developments in molecular cytogenetics even allow the detection of chromosomal aberrations in non-dividing cells from cytological preparations or tissue sections which may become available for routine diagnosis.	0.4419140860610568
In the course of 1 year, Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, which may lead to pseudomembranous colitis and therefore may be very harmful in frail elderly people, was diagnosed in six patients of a geriatric clinic.	0.7225290805661706
The disease is associated with antibiotic therapy, due to an overgrowth of the intestinal flora with Clostridium difficile.	0.6468154445589616
Symptoms varied from a state of asymptomatic carriage or benign diarrhea to acute stages of the disease with severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever and acute phase response.	0.5887623462155213
Diagnosis of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea was established when, in addition to typical clinical symptoms, a toxin-positive stool specimen was found.	0.5959068317196585
Oral vancomycin was effective in all cases, leading to a stop in the diarrhea and an amelioration of systemic inflammatory parameters.	0.4889353996118695
According to recent results, in order to prevent the induction of vancomycin-resistance and in view of higher treatment costs, metronidazole is considered as the drug of choice in mildly and moderately ill patients.	0.6341230525179306
This report analyzes 46 cases of personnel-to-patient transmissions of hepatitis B (HB), hepatitis C (HC) and HIV in health care settings.	0.5526184404292322
Similar circumstances were found for transmission of HB (40 cases, 404 infected patients), HC (4 cases, 224 infected patients) and HIV (2 cases, 7 infected patients).	0.7897792893489238
Cases with the highest number of transmissions (one anesthesiologist with 217 HC transmissions, and one EEG technologist with 75 HB transmissions) were attributed to poor infection control practices.	0.6215197050549748
As long as infected health care workers (HCW) adhere to general infection control measures, a risk for transmission to patients exists only from infected surgeons who perform'xposure-prone invasive procedures'.	0.4662541555290539
Whether changes in duties of infected HCW are necessary should be decided on an individual basis.	0.37482446197371655
Often, the infected personnel were assumed to have acquired the disease occupationally.	0.5397579794478112
Medical practices and devices bearing a risk of infection should constantly be reviewed with regard to risk for patients and personnel.	0.5998294533308081
The healthy newborn infant also has the right to optimal monitoring in order to detect any disturbance in postnatal adaptation as early as possible.	0.48542118876363133
The introduction of painless, simple, and yet reliable methods, e.g., pulse oximetry and transcutaneous bilirubin screening, has considerably improved the situation for obstetricians and midwives.	0.5989679640615085
Injuries of the spine in children rarely occur.	0.728810710844676
They amount to about 0.2 % of all fractures and dislocation and to 1.5 to 3 % of all lesions of the spine.	1.067703788318917
The younger an injured child is, the more likely it has sustained a lesion of the upper cervical spine.	0.680452138872662
This spinal segment in comparison to adults is concerned more often and accounts for 50 % of all C-spine injuries.	0.6654942022641416
Important differences between the adult spine and the spine in the child disappear with the age of 10 years.	0.7387035904437864
Later diagnostics, classification and treatment correspond widely with the principles valid in adults.	0.4331110225744035
The knowledge of the normal shape and development of the spine are crucial in avoiding misinterpretations of X-ray films.	0.7506748807959615
Typical examples include the confusion of synchondrosis with fractures or of subluxations of the atlas and the C2/C3 segment with "true" instabilities.	0.4244986724194751
Relevant lesions always are accompanied by clear clinical symptoms.	0.23084230578072562
Specific injuries of the growing axial skeleton are lesions of the cartilaginous endplates and "fractures" of the synchondrosis.	0.5826464028536825
Although a variety of histologic entities were described, primary tumors of the trachea are rare findings.	0.6127247793514149
Over a period of 20 years, 30 patients underwent 31 tracheal resections in two hospitals for thoracic surgery.	0.48392053914984856
Among them 4 patients had thyroid carcinoma involving the trachea.	0.29794232693290856
In these patients a strumectomy combined with tracheal resection was performed.	0.5573662040548181
One re-operation for erosion bleeding of the innominate artery on the 8th postoperative day was successfully performed.	0.41768820795503325

Speculations concerning a possible association between temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) and ear symptoms of otalgia and tinnitus have been made in the dental and medical literature for a long time.	0.6063191724497381
Current understanding of this association is reviewed.	0.2659227499895665
An analysis of relevant studies published between 1947 and 1996 shows that a relatively high percentage of TMD patients reported the presence of ear pain and noise.	0.4960951927789838
However, a cause-effect relationship has not been established to date.	0.787195474921468
Theories that try to explain the concurrence of TMD symptoms and ear symptoms (particularly tinnitus) by a common underlying cause remain speculative.	0.5768946291942497
It has to be taken into consideration that due to their high prevalence, TMDs and ear symptoms in a given patient may be present by chance alone.	0.624721821724663
A methodological weakness of most of the studies available is the fact that control groups were not considered.	0.5809856695389225
Owing to the lack of prospective, controlled, and randomized studies, statements regarding the effectiveness of certain dental measures for the treatment of otalgia and tinnitus in TMD patients are not well supported.	0.6072797956724728
Our report describes a 46-year-old woman with self-inflicted oedema of the left leg and the left arm.	0.7488288339823755
She induced leg oedema by an elastic bandage tourniquet and arm oedema by holding her arm dependent and immobile.	0.30089567664107064
A preexisting disorder of the affected leg (postthrombotic syndrome) and of the affected arm (hypoesthesia subsequent to surgical injury of the plexus brachialis) delayed the diagnostic proceedings.	0.7261412777328138
Our case report shows that: -  Confirmed presence of organic disease does not exclude limb oedema of self-inflicted origin.	0.7210293957443066
-  Oedema resulting from a tourniquet and "hysterical oedema" can be developed by one and the same patient.	0.743982548654139
-  Effective care of such patients is only possible if dermatologist and psychiatrist work together all the time (liaison psychiatry).	0.572379221680393
Purpose: This study was conducted to control improvement in the high preoperative prevalence of TMJ symptoms in patients treated by long-term orthodontic therapy for class II malocclusion.	0.8559527485934934
Patients and methods: A total of 57 patients were examined at least 8 years after surgery, 37 having received orthodontic treatment and orthognathic surgery and 20 surgery but without orthodontic treatment.	0.6135422384503345
Myofunctional, disk and condylar symptoms were recorded according to the Krough-Poulsen scheme.	0.35294489783588817
Results: Both groups showed a normal maximal interincisal distance.	0.6018765342123987
The deviation during the opening movement was mainly sigmoidal in the group with orthodontic treatment and terminal in the other group.	0.6221112218353322
Muscular pain predominated in the group without orthodontic treatment.	0.5455663253636001
Clicking sounds of the TMJ were registered in 70% of both groups.	0.6952647378809503
Occlusal interference and a higher interocclusal distance when speaking were found more often in patients without orthodontic treatment.	0.6189768722552615
Preoperatively, clicking and crepitation sounds had been recorded in 60% of both patients groups.	0.6304925694441966
Conclusion: In conclusion, a high postoperative prevalence of TMJ dysfunction symptoms was found in patients with class II malocclusion 8-10 years after orthognathic surgery with or without orthodontic treatment.	0.7513617245396438
Both groups often exhibited TMJ clicking and crepitation sounds, whereas the patients that had not received orthodontic treatment had a higher prevalence of occlusal interference and muscular pain.	0.5318173211967892
The synthesis of pS 2 protein is induced through estrogen-dependent transcription of the pS 2 gene.	0.4414165637837446
The presence of the pS 2 protein in breast cancer is thought to be as valuable as receptor status, or even more so, in predicting the response to hormonal therapy.	0.7044892953293359
Furthermore, pS 2 appears to be a prognostic factor for primary breast cancer.	0.6577625979055901
In 162 cases of primary breast cancer, pS 2 was tested by immunohistochemical procedures on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues.	0.48602249922708646
Staining was evaluated semiquantitatively using an immunoreactive score (IRS).	0.3828207350369793
The concentrations of pS 2 in tumor cytosol were determined using an immunoradiometric assay.	0.461042979023266
Positive staining for pS 2 (IRS >= 2) was seen in 27 % of the tumors.	0.8699421217413733
Comparison of immunohistochemical and biochemical detection (26 % of tumors had pS 2 cytosol concentrations above the cut-off value of 26 ng/mg cell protein) revealed an 81 % concordance rate (r = 0.76; P < 0.0001).	0.6079159996433
Univariate analysis showed no significant correlation of immunohistochemical pS 2 detection and age or menopausal status of patients, tumor size, tumor grade or nodal status.	0.6472207964151749
However, the immunohistochemical pS 2 status correlated significantly with the immunohistochemical detection of the estrogen (ER; P < 0.001) and progesterone receptor status (PR; P < 0.0001).	0.6031845047982208
pS 2-positive tumors were ER-positive in 66 % of cases and PR-positive in 73 %; 89 % of pS 2-positive tumors were positive for ER and/or PR.	0.7870587439576233
The incidence of immunohistochemical pS 2 detection was 41 % in the group of steroid receptor positive carcinomas (ER- and/or PR-positive) in contrast to 7 % in steroid receptor negative tumors (ER- and PR-negative).	0.7981209136806416
Patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass grafting may develop acute myocardial infarction late after surgery.	0.5825828237384126
It is not exactly known in these patients whether acute infarction is predominantly caused by occlusion of bypass or native vessels.	0.5512508615754984
Also, there is no systematic and prospective data available with respect to an invasive, revascularizing therapeutic approach.	0.5290977306613917
Therefore, acute coronary angiograms were obtained in 21 consecutive patients with acute infarctions and remote bypass grafting to elucidate mechanisms causing myocardial infarction in these patients, and to assess results of catheter-based recanalization.	0.822285804736207
We report the clinical and laboratory results of a family where one boy and one girl presented with a clinical picture resembling the X-linked agammaglobulinemia known as Bruton's disease.	0.7816197406742597
Both children showed severe bacterial infections starting at the age of around 6 months, a lack of all immunoglobulin classes and absence of mature B-cells in the peripheral blood.	0.5859743621084476
With respect to reports from the literature these results are yet another indicator for the existence of an autosomal-recessiv disorder with the same clinical make-up as Bruton's disease.	0.5598959002395397
A deletion on chromosome 14 leading to the disorder was identified.	0.5086975682725189
Conservative treatment of genuine stress urinary incontinence in females gained more and more interest.	0.44675636690300813
The use of mini-devices is one of the newly developed therapeutical options however, its clinical relevance and longterm-results are still under debate.	0.6682492162614714
This review article gives a critical evaluation of the available urethral plugs and regulators and new developments as well according to the longterm-follow-up studies in the literature and own experience with those devices.	0.772135165727325
The continence rates that can be obtained with the different plugs or regulators are dependent upon the degree of stress incontinence, ability to insert the plug and compliance of the patient.	0.6134956063914628
Reported longterm results vary between 48 % and 100 %.	0.749405897440926
The most frequent side effects are urinary infection, haematuria and/or handling problems with the devices.	0.6023274720616973
According to the published material it is impossible to give therapeutical standards for treatment of female stress urinary incontinence with urethral mini-devices.	0.5290144921141093
Although proper Patient selection might give excellent longterm-results in patient continence rates.	0.3577079876079441
Background: In contrast to the correction of simple myopia there is no widely accepted technique for the correction of myopic astigmatism.	0.6670448924578407
Currently two techniques are available: the photoastigmatic refractive keratectomy (PARK) and the combination of arcuate keratotomies with standard PRK (PRK-T).	0.5959629428582547
Although there are randomized data for CABG vs. medical therapy and CABG vs. PTCA in primary therapy of CAD, there is few evidence on the appropriate therapy of recurrent angina after prior CABG.	0.5348752307436608
We analyzed data from 1265 consecutive patients (PTS.)	0.497071452734436
presenting for recurrent angina after previous CABG who required either re-CABG (n=67), PTCA (n=768) or medical therapy alone (medRx) (n=430) at our institution during 1986 through 1996.	0.5731084275837212
Outcome after index therapy is monitored during 45  +/-  34 months.	0.5130403020029349
The 3 therapeutic groups were similar with respect to gender (84 % male), age at therapy (60 years), prevalence of diabetes (22 %), and time to first ischemic event after primary CABG (37 months).	0.7026557661036604
Actuarial survival was significantly higher in the PTCA-group at 1, 5 and 10 years after therapy of recurrent angina, despite the freedom from subsequent re-intervention was significantly lower (1-year-survival 95 % [37 %] vs. 95 % [3] medRx vs. 79 % [4 %] re-CABG, 5-year-survival 87 % [57 %] vs 78 % [17 %] medRx vs. 50 % [4 %] re-CABG and 10-year-survival 72 % [65 %] vs. 63 % [31 %] medRx vs. 50 % [15 %] re-CABG resp., p < 0.0001, [numbers in brackets represent corresponding values for incidence of re-intervention, p < 0.0001]).	0.923410869805057
These findings were similar after adjustment for different baseline characteristics.	0.4342048704981464
Due to advances in surgical methods, such as miniplate and lag screw osteosynthesis, there is current discussion about the adequate therapy of condylar fractures.	0.5110123525504587
Regarding the insufficient outcome of conservative treatment confirmed by refined methods of functional diagnosis, there is a trend towards surgical therapy, at least in cases of condylar displacement out of the fossa.	0.7225790102446829
This trend was also prompted when surgeons learned that the condyle determines local growth but does not serve as a growth center of the mandible.	0.49572027434272947
Along with increased interest in temporomandibular function and surgical therapy of internal disorders, surgical therapy of traumatic soft tissue lesions was emphasized.	0.605650274390465
This consequently led to surgical restoration of intraarticular fractures.	0.29597748749123093
Conservative treatment will nonetheless be sufficient in cases of minor displacement due to a higher ability of remodeling, even more so in children.	0.6685002386377348
A case of a 37-year-old woman with symmetrical bilateral apocrine hidrocystomas at the lateral margins of the eyelids is presented.	0.6246017811079924
The symmetrical, simultaneous and bilateral appearance of the lesions, the lack of association with other abnormalities and the absence of the lesion in the family history make this case remarkable.	0.7451152576890536
The situation of intensive care units (ICU) in Germany was analyzed by a national survey.	0.9255635692803189
Questionnaires consisting of multiple-choice and short-answer questions were sent to ICUs of university hosptitals, hospitals with >1000 beds, 500-1000 beds, and hospitals with <500 beds separately with regard to the different disciplines (anesthesia ICUs, surgical ICUs, cardiac surgical ICUs, neurosurgical ICUs, neurological ICUs, mixed-surgical ICUs, internal ICUs, interdiscipline ICUs).	0.6093946766266876
The personality organisation and the process of therapy of drug-addicted patients are examined by the comparative analysis of 15 single cases.	0.5743451771838682
The antisocial tendency is emphasised as the main clinical feature.	0.44315068000899505
It is related to specific genetic traumata and the externalisation of parts of the superego.	0.451803713914889
During the therapeutical process, the antisocial tendency destroys the therapeutical relation.	0.49741409753055293
If it is possible to continue therapy beyond this point, the patients can now enter into a process, in which new identifications and the integration of parts of the superego are involved.	0.747333626207821
Approaching the end of the therapy, patients, again, tend to destroy the results of therapy if one does not consider specific problems of the separation process.	0.6714610259679047
Objective: The Uppsala-definition of leukoplakia has recently redefined oral leukoplakia.	0.3983795922773422
Based on this definition, the aim of our study was to reevaluate the prevalence of oral leukoplakia in patients with histologically proven primary oral cancer.	0.6959983355598244
Design: A total of 101 inpatients in four tumor centers in Berlin were interviewed and clinically examined just prior to surgery of an oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).	0.5104645752566566
Results: The prevalence of leukoplakia immediately adjacent to the carcinoma was 15.8%.	0.6519733698898215
Additional leukoplakias without relation to the carcinoma were found in 4% of the patients.	0.8153086865148252
There were no significant differences in age- or sex-distribution, history of tobacco habits or diet  between patients with or without leukoplakia.	0.7845928998840017
T1 carcinomas were found in 62.5% of patients with, and 24.4% of patients without associated leukoplakia, whereas a balanced distribution was found for the pre-operative staging of the tumor.	0.8861465793433638
Conclusions: The prevalence of oral leukoplakia in patients with OSCC was low, compared to retrospective studies.	0.5396665036229068
The presence or absence of leukoplakia indicated no influence on the prognosis of the tumor, except of tumor size.	0.6684601691388387
The results emphasize that most OSCC develop from healthy appearing oral mucosa.	0.28595660491950353
Cutaneous angiosarcomas mainly arise on the scalp and face of older patients.	0.3786712058153347
They present with reddish nodules or plaques and tend to bleed and ulcerate.	0.24717338178253592
Angiosarcomas show an aggressive and recurrent course and have a high potential for metastasis.	0.6290898084105182
We report on a 48-year-old patient with unilateral eyelid edema as the first manifestation of an angiosarcoma.	0.7113485656194493
The clinical presentation, the history of contact allergy, the presence of antinuclear antibodies, and abnormal thyroid function tests favoured a non-neoplastic disease.	0.7023087208840719
However, multiple biopsies confirmed the diagnosis of a highly differentiated angiosarcoma.	0.8231305323561305
Staging of the patient revealed no metastasis.	0.944299510150137
After radical surgery including orbital exenteration and postoperative radiation therapy, no recurrence was observed with a follow up of 26 months.	0.6298139777038725
This case underlines the importance of including angiosarcoma in the differential diagnosis of unilateral eyelid edema.	0.40264847895017175
The Marburg Cardiomyopathy Study (MACAS) is a prospective observational study designed to determine the value of the following potential non-invasive arrhythmia risk predictors in more than 200 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) over a 5-year-follow-up period: New York Heart Association functional class, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and ejection fraction, left bundle branch block and atrial fibrillation on ECG, QTc and JTc-dispersion on 12-lead ECG, abnormal time-domain analysis and spectral turbulence analysis of the signal-averaged ECG, ventricular arrhythmias and heart-rate variability on 24-hour Holter ECG, baroreflex sensitivity, and microvolt T wave alternans during exercise.	0.6247715089359851
Abstract   The observation of extremely variable clinical courses for patients with renal cell carcinomas of an identical pathological stage as well as a comparable histological differentiation resp.	0.6862588099680218
growth pattern strongly indicates the existence of tumors harboring different biological aggressiveness.	0.2999689590710182
Currently available histopathological classification systems do not predict the biological behaviour of renal cell cancer as sufficiently as the establishment of a therapeutical strategy adjusted to the individual patient would require.	0.6358826784372054
The need for a more refined characterization of the biological potential of the indidual tumor results from the introduction of modified operative strategies as organ-preserving surgery, for example, as well as from the recently suggested application of an adjuvant systemic therapy adapted to the individual risk for tumor recurrence resp.	0.653564670090774
the development of progressive disease.	0.33170526217566904
Therefore, the clinically orientated basic scientist and the basic scientifically orientated clinician intensively try to determine prognostically important biological variables which would allow to better predict the biological aggressiveness of a single tumor in addition to "classical" prognostic parameters (T-stage, histological grading, growth patterns).	0.6296137782310193
In this context, several biological parameters including the identification of alterations on the DNA-, RNA- and protein level have been discussed as possible biological prognostic markers for renal cell cancer.	0.6204608876436128
The present review tries to reflect currently available biological characteristics of RCC which might gain clinical importance with regard to an individualized therapy in the near future.	0.4965656009238259
Until now reports of factitious disease have not been found in the ENT literature.	0.7089347512191754
In contrast, the dermatologic literature estimates an incidence from 0.01 to 0.26%.	0.6998681943970442
In order to achieve effective treatment for these patients, knowledge of the characteristic symptoms is fundamental.	0.631572815525017
The present paper describes the variety of disease possible, using three cases treated between 1992 and 1994 in the ENT Department of Cologne.	0.6594864118216974
According to the literature, females are involved in a ratio of 9:1, with the majority working in medically related professions.	0.7127436488585778
Depression and anorexia are typical symptoms.	0.24783944222256368
When a factitious disease is suspected, psychiatric consultation is essential.	0.47732692896723977
Confrontation of a suspect patient by the otolaryngologist is not often considered because several reports quote suicidal behavior in up to 25% of self-manipulating patients and tendencies to refuse to follow psychiatric treatment are considerable.	0.5080370410487098
Numerous different diseases lead to scarring alopecia with irreversible follicular destruction as a common ending.	0.40769508029130663
Current classifications are based on clinical, histopathological or prognostic parameters, as well as on pathogenetic criteria which allow only a rough assessment because the precise mechanisms leading to scarring alopecia are still unknown.	0.4917605079056191
Inadequacies of the established classifications are obvious when regarding special forms of scarring alopecia like lichen planopilaris or pseudopelade Brocq.	0.3717242770698284
In order to develop more satisfying classifications, recent insights into biology and pathology of the hair follicle and follicular cycling have to be considered.	0.616744397952496
The most important structures for the survival of the hair follicle are the epithelial stem cells which reside in the follicular bulge and the fibroblasts of the dermal papilla including the molecular communication between these two cell populations.	0.5810619885457209
Research in the field of scarring alopecia should aim at defining the pathological processes on any of the above mentioned levels which will lead to an irreversible damage of the hair follicle thus allowing the development of new therapeutic agents.	0.6598156861911517
Rheumatoid neutrophilic dermatitis is a rare dermatologic disorder seen in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis.	0.6415774108309571
Clinically firm erythematous 3-5 mm papules are found mainly on the arms, the hips and the proximal thighs.	0.660931086967519
The lesions may be pruritic leading to excoriations and crusts.	0.3410473378368936
Histology reveals a dense dermal infiltrate with neutrophilic granulocytes, while leukocytoclasia may be seen, vasculitits is not observed.	0.48528794933768443
This overview of rheumatoid neutrophilic dermatitis may help remind the practioner to include this uncommon disorder in the differential diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis-related dermatoses.	0.4607133518438556
Background: The rehabilitation of low vision patients is of increasing importance since the number of these patients has grown rapidly.	0.7369284673489748
We wanted to evaluate the actual spectrum of patients concerning age and diagnoses and the appropriate low vision aids (LVA) in 1 year.	0.6049015170913655
It is generally accepted that most inguinal hernias should be operated electively.	0.4594708825133289
This study presents a risk calculation challenging this view.	0.36108256628619284
Three strategies are presented: prophylactic indication on principle (A), elective operation in every second case (B), and operation in case of strangulation only (C).	0.5490626767164214
On the basis of available epidemiological data it is calculated that, for the male German population aged 65 years and over 69 954 (A), 36 292 (B), and 2630 (C) inguinal hernia repairs would be necessary annually; 167 (A), 145 (B) and 123 (C) perioperative deaths would occur, connected with 1702 (A), 1373 (B) and 1048 (C) years of life lost, respectively.	0.5558893310166629
Thus, operation of every inguinal hernia would result in a (small) reduction of life expectancy.	0.743026592114023
These data provide evidence that in elderly patients the indication for operative treatment of inguinal hernias should depend upon symptoms and suffering.	0.6123768570873446
There is no reason to operate on asymptomatic patients because of a presumed risk of strangulation.	0.6551687611129269
Since first described by Kibler (1955) hyperalgetic areas of the skin in company with arthropathy or diseases of internal organs are known to be a useful sign to define the affected segment.	0.7195031000298758
While seldom utilized by physicians, physiotherapists frequently make use of these special findings concerning the skin as a common part of their daily work.	0.5612082925405922
A certain problem exists in ranging correctly the corresponding segment of the spine, this mostly caused by the inaccurate idea of anatomical facts.	0.5550794846239853
The actual as well as the former literature in this field shows very different views and opinions, all of them rather in contrast to the real anatomical findings.	0.6929953065185138
In the following the topographic-anatomic conditions are presented of which exact knowledge is necessary to evaluate the palpation's result "Kibler's plica positive" relative to its diagnostic valence.	0.5652834398307303
Aim of the study and methods: In the present study the correlation between ischemia induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias and a dynamic behavior of ventricular late potentials was investigated.	0.7806235330754229
In 16 patients with significant coronary artery disease and survived sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia an electrophysiologic study (EPS) was performed.	0.6926077340296152
Before EPS (t1), at every stimulation interval and after induction of a ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) the lactate concentration was measured in arterial blood and in the coronary sinus for calculation of the myocardial lactate extraction.	0.7114166015723402
Furthermore, before investigation, after induction of a VT/VF and after a 10 minute recovery phase an analysis of the signal averaged ECG was performed.	0.6733584099944935
Nine patients showed a so-called "lactate reversal", i.e., an increase of the lactate concentration in the coronary sinus over the concentration of the arterial blood as an expression of ischemia development, during inducibility of a VT/VF (group A).	0.703975463626226
The control group consisted of 7 patients without ischemia related VT/VF (group B).	0.574082737305922
Results: In group A significant changes of the three late potential criteria were found between t1 and t2 (QRS:115.61 +/- 13.86 vs. 126.06 +/- 16.74, p=0.08; RMS: 25.81 +/- 22.26 vs. 13.11 +/- 10.72, p=0.01; LAS: 37.72 +/- 19.26 vs. 50.06 +/- 10.72, p=0.01).	0.6440344795828272
In group B, no significant changes could be measured.	0.8059768050502724
Furthermore, the prevalence of late potentials increased in group A from 66% (t1) to 89% (t2), whereas in group B no increase was detectable.	0.8152924230685274
Conclusions: These data suggest a dynamic behavior of ventricular late potentials in correlation with the inducibility of ventricular tycharrhythmias due to ischemic circumstances.	0.5678185157072703
Therefore the dynamic behavior of ventricular late potentials can be an expression of a modification of the arrhythmogenic substrate in arrhythmia endangered patients.	0.463565555496484
Recent studies and reviews continue to report a high mortality associated with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which involves a severe inflammatory reaction within the whole lung that is frequently associated with multiple-organ failure.	0.5676013231536332
Important factors contributing to the poor results in severe ARDS are the aggressive procedures required to maintain sufficient arterial oxygenation, such as mechanical ventilation with high inspiratory pressures and high inspired oxygen concentrations (FiO2) which themselves contribute to the progression of the disease.	0.5636272933989814
As no specific therapy that reduces or prevents the general inflammatory reaction is known, current therapy is limited to procedures that minimize peak inspiratory pressures and FiO2.	0.5324934442583695
Therefore, pressure- and volume-limited ventilation modes with positive end-expiratory pressure, controlled hypercapnia, differential lung ventilation when appropriate, positioning (particularly prone), and aggressive dehydration are used.	0.6308278603838646
Should these procedures fail to improve arterial gas exchange, the patients may be additionally treated by veno-venous extracorporeal gas exchange.	0.5556834667343841
To reduce the risk of severe haemorrhagic complications due to high levels of systemic heparinization, systems internally coated with covalently bound heparin, which allow a lower level of systemic anticoagulation, should be used.	0.5978519469939797
From April 1989 to August 1993, 89 patients were transferred to our intensive care unit for treatment of severe ARDS; 52 were treated by combining the described conventional methods without artificial gas exchange (survival rate 88%) and 37 additionally underwent artificial gas exchange (survival rate 57%).	0.612769503006663
The overall survival rate was 75%.	0.5658086310819309
