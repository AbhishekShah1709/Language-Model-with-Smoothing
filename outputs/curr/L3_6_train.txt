Children cannot self estimate the severity of the injury so subjective statements are insecure.	0.9150837443954487
Trauma, surgery, pain and immobilisation cause a marked malfunction of the senso-motor system which is effectively treated by physiotherapy.	1.0432089838931335
Malignant mixed MÃ¼llerian tumours (MMMT) are tumours of the female genital tract which rarely occur in extragenital sites.	0.9140178482552024
We report a case of a 46-year-old female with MMMT with primary occurrence in the greater omentum.	1.0666374044330178
Only 19 cases of primary extragenital manifestation of this tumour are described in the literature.	1.0131755914856417
The clinical appearance, diagnosis, therapy, histological evaluation and histogenesis are discussed.	0.8875039531666341
The publication of the CONSORT Statement was aimed at the improvement of the quality of research reports of randomized controlled clinical trials.	0.8613415953436246
It contains the most important standards of high quality research.	1.0475760882427394
Although originally meant for randomized studies only most aspects of this statement can be applied to other kinds of clinical studies.	0.901576254367351
The demand for minimally invasive techniques and more comfort for the patient is becoming higher and higher.	1.1469366450081266
In the region of the ankle joint, it is therefore ideal to use the arthroscope for pathology.	1.094992319282851
Indications for ankle joint arthroscopy are: soft tissue impingement, ligament instability, impingement in the syndesmosis, osteochondral lesions, loose bodies, arthrosis, and loose os trigonum of the talus.	0.9062873846171623
In the subtalar joint the indications are rupture of the ligaments, loose bodies, and synovitis with soft tissue impingement.	0.9435850456887915
A new indication is arthroscopically assisted arthrodesis of the talar and subtalar joint.	0.7512306394680842
The reported high incidence of complications, especially in terms of neurovascular lesions, can be avoided by an exact knowledge of anatomy and use of non-invasive distraction of the joint.	1.2054382774253842
Although alexithymia is found in patients with various somatic disorders, it remains unclear whether it is really related to organic disease - as proposed by the founders of the concept .[125].	1.1416758910534173
As the interplay between the experience of emotion and possible adverse effects on health is a fundamental tenet of psychosomatic medicine, alexithymia remains an interesting concept to be further explored, especially concerning (1) possible pathways linking emotion to physical illness and (2) the neurobiologic basis of emotional information processing.	1.05953164833781
Compared to the intense international discussion on the subject, in Germany there are still many doubts concerning alexithymia: while some clinicians question the validity of the whole concept, psychiatric and psychosomatic researchers seem unsure about alexithymia's role in their search for a physiological basis to the link between emotion and physical disease.	1.1142295359565821
Our review deals with the empirical literature concerning that possible association and tries to tie in their data with modern, neurobiologically founded insights into emotional information processing within the brain.	0.789649790619417
In the etiopathology of tension type headache, vascular and autonomic disorders are discussed.	0.9592504041527218
Fifteen patients with chronic tension type headache according to the criteria of the IHS were investigated using the TCD-ergometer-test - a method used to evaluate the myogenic mechanism of cerebrovascular autoregulation - and the results were compared with the findings in fifteen healthy control subjects.	1.3027857667819276
An immunohistochemical and morphometric study was performed on bone marrow biopsies in 604 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) to compare morphological and clinical features and to evaluate effects of interferon (IFN) and chemotherapy.	1.3232835634129692
Following morphometry significant correlations were calculated between number of CD61+ megakaryocytes, including their precursors with fiber density.	0.9713519153460493
This finding is in line with the close functional relationship between megakaryopoiesis and fibroblasts regarding the complex pathomechanism of myelofibrosis.	0.8508909217367192
The latter was observed in about 28% of patients already at diagnosis.	1.2144894450050754
In a similar way, the frequency of CD68+ macrophages was correlated with the amount of Ret40f+ nucleated erythroid precursors, implicating an involvement of this cell lineage in iron turnover, hemoglobin synthesis, and degradation of the expelled nuclei from normoblasts.	0.9582214325367477
The (-D-galactosyl residue-expressing) Pseudo-Gaucher cells were detectable in 30% of pretreatment specimens.	1.1886328934880832
Moreover, significant associations were calculable between reduction in erythropoiesis or increase in fibers with clinical features such as hemoglobin level, percentages of myelo- and erythroblasts in the peripheral blood, and spleen size.	1.0273139045340451
These variables are in keeping with more advanced stages of CML.	0.8107989634890501
Based on our morphometric evaluations, a classification into three different histological subgroups: granulocytic, megakaryocytic, and myelofibrotic was carried out.	1.1141557690139166
This simplified staging system was correlated with corresponding sets of hematological data.	0.7529903799624218
Sequential biopsies in 173 patients with monotherapy by IFN, hydroxyurea (HU), or busulfan (BU) revealed a fibrogenic effect of IFN in contrast to a fiber-reducing property of HU.	1.0673777766227517
The dynamics of myelofibrosis and changes of major cell lineages during treatment were readily demonstrable by calculating corresponding indices.	0.8698303384153092
These included the ratios between quantitative differences of corresponding variables at repeated examinations and time.	0.7797284584386714
Thus, in patients with complete hematological remission following IFN administration, regeneration of erythropoiesis was found to be accompanied by an increase in the total number of CD68+ macrophages, including activated subpopulations.	1.0588621799032003
Histological subgroups showed a transition from a (nonfibrotic) granulocytic and megakaryocyte pattern to the myelofibrotic subtype in about 40% of patients.	0.9655683628217125
This change was opposed to a numerical reduction in the myelofibrotic subtype which occurred in 17 patients (36%), but predominantly in those under HU therapy.	1.0066790620961958
In conclusion, the striking heterogeneity of bone marrow features in CML warrants a careful morphological evaluation of trephine biopsies and appropriate means of processing to achieve relevant correlations with clinical data and, thus, allows a more elaborate insight into the dynamics of the disease process.	1.1263196026512898
Computer-aided analysis of the results of the intrathecal infusion test using our mathematical computation leads to simplification of this investigation, and therefore normal pressure hydrocephalus is more easily diagnosed.	1.1807686201080618
Simultaneous measurement of resistance and compliance during a single investigation allows the exertion of the patients to be minimized.	1.134615317809289
In contrast to classic methods it is not necessary that the ICP reaches a plateau.	1.1444687291920417
Our mathematical method diverges with the description of a pressure-dependent slope of the function for the resistance from the static examination models.	0.9247324829501369
For that we are able to take the non-linearity of the cerebrospinal fluid resorption into consideration.	0.8151104564270318
The intrathecal infusion test is a reliable diagnostic method for measuring resistance and compliance in patients suspected of having normal pressure hydrocephalus.	0.9644492408336169
Primary medullary nailing of femoral fractures is burdened by the risk of central and pulmonary complications in patients with polytrauma, especially in conjunction with craniocerebral or thoracic trauma.	1.108497720122799
This also applies to unreamed medullary nailing.	0.5720566831271655
Primary treatment with external fixation necessitates secondary surgery with an altered procedure, the timing of which is not predictable.	1.078829445293932
Plate osteosynthesis with anatomical repositioning of the fragments and rigid fixation is a technically demanding procedure, but can lead to fragment necrosis due to fragment denudation.	1.1049636884782943
In a prospective study conducted from 1 September 1994 to 30 June 1996 on 17 polytraumatized patients (average ISS: 30 points), simple femoral stem fractures (A-1 to B-3 of the AO-classification) were stabilized by elastic plate osteosynthesis using biological technique.	1.188680472371785
While cautiously preserving the periosteal and muscle connections to the bone, a plate is inserted as a bridge without any interfragmentary compression.	0.9372748571768318
At least two to four holes are left free in the center of the plate.	0.8660473712922366
This allows micro-movements in the fracture gap without the risk of material fatigue.	0.9244546926917877
All of the fractures were immediately stabilized on the day of the accident.	0.9175455830120309

Coumarin necrosis is a rare, but life-threatening complication when administering coumarin in oral anticoagulant therapy.	0.9705494751896373
Predestined areas are the breasts, hips, gluteal region, thighs or lower legs.	0.8106232884080273
Thrombotic tendencies, such as congenital or acquired changes in coagulation, lead to a higher risk of coumarin necrosis.	1.027592045838606
A direct, toxic effect of coumarin on the capillary system may also play a role.	1.015633088464304
Although the incidence is only 0.01-0.1%, lethality lies at 15%, the knowledge of this rare complication is important in order to begin with a proper treatment punctually.	1.323558079872977

With special emphasis on pediatric aspects, the presently available data on the effectiveness and safety or specific immunotherapy with house dust mite extracts are reviewed.	1.0282135852055598
In addition to antiinflammatory treatment and allergen avoidance, specific immunotherapy offers an approach to the treatment of bronchial asthma in those patients sensitized against house dust mites.	1.0988278018259703
Controlled studies of specific immunotherapy against house dust mites show decreased symptom-medication scores and positiv effects on some lung function parameters.	0.888500869104692
Therapeutic efficacy appears to be better in pediatric patients.	0.9380095900325449
Severe side effects seem to be rare, but are more common in patients with chronic airway obstruction, in infants and with rush-immunotherapy.	1.3271992408417081
From January 1996 untill February 1997 6,376 patients were treated by our group with PTCA and 3,859 (60.5%) received one or several stents.	1.1756072621821385
An angiographic follow up was achieved in 63% of the patients with 1,267 experiencing restenosis (32.8%).	1.1499036311448916
Of those beeing treated with re-PTCA 302 were randomly selected for further analysis.	0.8562894617006371
In-stent-restenosis was treated with rotablator in 8 patients (2.7%), with eximer laser in 21 (7.0%) and with another stent in 48 patients (15.9%).	1.2151889458389167
225 patients (74.4%) of this subselection were treated with balloonangioplasty only.	1.1815198297904328
It is not clear whether public health insurance will cover post exposure prophylaxis (PEP), whereby the question of costs being covered by private health insurance companies is not taken into consideration here.	1.0784019937346072
Regulations concerning prevention (Â§ 20 SGB V), precautionary medical services (Â§ 23 SGB V) and health examination (Â§ 25 SBG V) offer no legal basis for cost coverage.	1.1199321098168669
PEP is patient care in the sense of Â§ 27 SGB V. However, this particular treatment has not yet been adapted into public health insurance financial guidelines because the federal committees have not yet made appropriate recommendations.	1.1282851152209352
This should be achieved soon, in order to eliminate legal ambiguities in this area.	0.9850989712074345
The principles of the so called "new methods of examination and treatment" legal construct may support cost coverage liability.	1.1084492575515956
On the whole, however, German-Austrian recommendations concerning indication and use of PEP must be formulated more concretely and unambiguously.	1.013041676214429
If a doctor, in the case of an indication according to the German-Austrian recommendations, does not prescribe PEP, this would probably not be malpractice, because there are still many scientific questions to be answered.	1.2892972479836367
To clarify the functional mechanism of the Esmarch device in the treatment of sleep apnea, its effect on muscle activity during sleep was studied electromyographically with and without the appliance at the inferior head of the lateral pterygoid muscle, the genioglossal muscle, and the masseter muscle in 15 patients with sleep apnea syndrome.	1.275932429572252
During the obstructive apnea the muscles showed significantly lower amplitudes than before the apnea.	0.8609702120056827
No significant decrease in the amplitude was observed during the central apnea, but, after the obstructive and central apnea, significantly higher amplitudes were seen than beforehand.	1.2419304116133538
The amplitudes rose after the placement of the appliance, and the amplitudes of the genioglossal and lateral pterygoid muscles during obstructive apnea increased significantly after the insertion of the appliance.	1.1345181908978839
The results suggest that the device can activate the masticatory and tongue muscle activity and indicate that the muscles activated with the appliance can prevent obstruction in the oropharynx.	0.967707232066098
The Esmarch device not only helps avoid obstruction by mandibular protraction, but also affects function by activating the muscles.	1.0032740967363305
The analysis of the delinquency bringing disordered offenders into a hospital order institution reveals a lot of very conscious and well organized behavior during the criminal activity.	0.8830218845954676

The prevalence in paediatric obesity is increasing in many industrialised and developing countries and growing to a world-wide medical and socio-economic problem.	0.8375607368903449
In a recent report of the WHO the world-wide epidemic of obesity was addressed as a problem of highest priority.	1.0470787956446488
Inadequate long-term results of weight reduction in children and adolescents and the increasing socio-economic burden to the health systems, as well as the high grade of persistence of obesity aggravate the problem and demand primary prevention efforts.Future directions of primary prevention measures could be the time of onset of obesity, the "early adiposity rebound", intrauterine malnutrition, weight gain during infancy, low energy expenditure in infants, familial adiposity, composition of food and modification of fat intake.	1.2029872388752099
Despite advances in the field of orthopedic surgery, necrosis of the femoral head still remains a serious problem.	0.8327296128723288
Under normal conditions magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) is the gold standard for early diagnosis.	1.1779577570842235
Because of magnetic interference, this technique is not applicable in the diagnosis of posttraumatic necrosis with internal fixation, however.	1.2081333220828014
This seems to be an ideal indication for ossovenography: contrast medium is injected into the femoral head under X-ray control and the venous flow is documented.	1.215287212395518
Furthermore, it is possible to get histological samples from suspicious areas.	1.215055497231793
Ossovenography was performed in 12 patients and the results were compared with histological samples.	1.2399890264158835
In every patient in whom necrosis of the femoral head was diagnosed by ossovenography (91.6 %), we also found necrosis on histological examination.	1.1657033533051608
In one patient in whom physiological flow was found, there was a corresponding absence of necrosis in the histological sample.	1.1405278983852134
There were no complications during ossovenography.	1.064324422107371
The results suggest that ossovenography is a promising and reliable method for early diagnosis of necrosis of the femoral head in the presence of internal fixation devices.	1.100360312322435
To evaluate patients with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death the analysis of ventricular late potentials, heart rate variability and baroreflexsensitivity is helpful.	1.0536093262458204
However, the prediction of malignant arrhythmic events cannot be performed with sufficient accuracy.	1.0359594370161913
For a better identification of high risk patients other methods are necessary.	0.9798149413684433
In this study the impact of the chemoreflexsensitivity for the prediction of ventricular tachyarrhythmias was investigated.	0.9430747668091236
The results of a retrospective study concerning percutaneous catheter drainage of 62 intra-abdominal abscesses in 60 patients were demonstrated, including the procedure and complications.	1.2988036075335856
For the first access a thin needle was used to perform an aspiration biopsy under sonographic control.	1.0720842061350782
We placed a pigtail or van Sonnenberg catheter by Seldinger or trocar technique into the abscesses.	0.6499155971759445
The primary success rate of percutaneous drainage was 85 %.	0.8398386509651239
Complications occurred in 6.4 % of the cases with a mortality of 0 %.	1.2076364193167097
This method is an acceptable alternative to surgery for many patients.	0.9833961925740443
Ultrasound-guided percutaneous catheter drainage is the method of choice for uncomplicated abscesses, especially in the critically ill patient.	0.9845956775016312
Acute brain tissue damage or systemic illnesses can lead to local or diffuse brain edema and raised intracranial pressure (ICP).	0.8394634931086215
It is obvious that in all brain injuries additional factors (metabolic disturbances, hypoxia and hypercapnia, circulatory instability) aggravating brain edema and impairing recovery of viable neurons have to be treated immediately and consequently.	0.9744612565066613
Medical therapies for further treatment of elevated ICP depend not only on their mode of action and side effects but although on the specific illness.	1.1080216591171874
The different etiology and pathogenesis of developing brain edema and ICP elevation with either more local or generalized extension explain the different success of medical treatment strategies in severe head trauma compared to middle cerebral artery territory or complete hemispheric infarction.	1.012751611058033
An algorithm for treatment of postischemic brain edema in acute hemispheric infarction was developed.	0.9044257826117872
In an investigation of infection control methods for respirator systems in 89 randomly selected German intensive care units as a part of the NIDEP study (Nosocomial Infections in Germany - Surveillance and Prevention), it was found that respirator systems were exchanged daily in about 50% of the intensive care units.	1.1886857797255954
However, Craven et al.	1.2420825132278002
found that changing circuits (including tubing and exhalation valve and the attached humidifier) every 24 h rather than every 48 h was independently associated with the occurrence of nosocomial pneumonia.	0.962778639071975
On the basis of these results and recent studies, the current situation in the literature was analyzed in order to make recommendations for exchanging ventilator circuits.	1.3443572832015391
The key function of the uterine cervix to maintain pregnancy is biochemically characterized by an increased synthesis of proteins (e.g., collagen), proteoglycans, and glycoproteins (e.g., fibronectin) as well as by well-defined interactions between these components of the extracellular matrix.	1.1402491632363387
In contrast to the slow phase of the cervical ripening process in late pregnancy, dilatation of the cervix during parturition requires the rapid formation and action of catabolic enzyme systems, leading mainly to collagen degradation and changes in its architecture but also to degradation of other fundamental matrix proteins.	1.1262391456048066
It has been suggested that an increased production of tumor necrosis factor- and interleukin-1, for example, induces an increased expression of endothelial adhesion molecules with subsequent extravasation of granulocytes in the cervical stroma and that the chemotaxis and degranulation of these cells within the stroma is triggered by an increase in interleukin-8 concentration.	1.0523216920694907
The proteases (e.g., matrix metalloproteinase-8) released after degranulation of neutrophilic granulocytes encounter an already destabilized (loss of decorin) collagenous fiber network.	0.8498804600688954
The clinical consequences of this basic research is to develop new concepts in a more causal treatment of cervical pathology during pregnancy and parturition.	1.0906246404447983
Objectives: The involvement of cytokines in degeneration and inflammation of human tissue is well established.	0.9951420676804058
Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a major agent in the pathophysiology of periarticular bone resorption in rheumatoid arthritis and in osteoporosis.	1.0810875292085618
Because the use of recombinant cytokines and growth factors is limited due to their short half lives, techniques are needed to get a permanent release of these therapeutic proteins.	1.1043426689503177
The rational of this study was to show that retroviral transduction of human osteoblastic cells is possible in vitro using the marker gene LacZ and the potentially therapeutic gene encoding for human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein (IL-1Ra).	1.0861431260156609
Different transduction techniques were combined to improve the rate of transduction in vitro.	0.9471409798273569
Methods: Osteoblastic cells were isolated from human spongious bone and cultured in vitro.	1.0175433633010371
The -galactosidase (LacZ) gene and the cDNA of IL-1Ra were introduced into the isolated cells by retrovirus mediated gene transfer.	0.9886195070753854
LacZ activity was determined by Xgal staining, IL-1Ra was measured quantitatively by ELISA.	1.0026702931838676
Results: The transfer of retroviral IL-1Ra led to IL-1Ra expression of 8614 to 10089pg IRAP/50000 cells/48h.	0.9849723224733324
By combining different techniques to improve transduction, the X-gal staining established a rate of transduction of 60%.	0.9869732461424482
Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that retroviral transduction of human osteobalstic cells is possible in vitro, and leads to high levels of the synthesized transgene product.	0.9378386468002377
The rate of retroviral transduction can be accelerated in vitro.	0.8020970898037981

We report a 72-year-old patient who developed an isolated bilateral hypoglossal nerve paralysis following head trauma with complete recovery after three months.	1.0702595590444732
Since the CT scan did not show any fractures of the posterior skull base, we discuss a traction nerve injury as a possible mechanism.	1.3046407603199754
Injuries of the colon and retroperitoneum are rarely observed after blunt abdominal trauma and occur in about 5 - 20 % of the patients.	1.0806477355695665
The majority of complications are due to initial misdiagnoses and a delay in treatment.	0.9260820561587692
Lesions of the pancreas and duodenum are the most frequent diagnoses in the retroperitoneal space, while major vascular traumata or urogenital injuries are rare.	1.1770269494764596
Retroperitoneal hematoma are most likely due to pelvic fractures.	0.73628716355481
The survival of patients after colon or retroperitoneal injuries depends on the severity of concomitant organ trauma, the time of diagnosis, and a situation-adapted therapeutic strategy.	1.279725644500385
The treatment of the typical caudal retroperitoneal hematoma following pelvic fractures is conservative in most patients.	1.041250831753371
Early pelvic stabilization, e. g., with external fixation, is recommended in these patients.	1.057693998818462
Central retroperitoneal hematoma in the supra - or inframesocolic space should be treated surgically, as major vascular injuries are most likely in these patients.	1.2552925535295336
Duodenal or pancreatic injuries need surgical exploration in the majority of patients; the therapeutic spectrum ranges from simple sutures to pancreatoduodenal resection.	1.0020240802305869
The treatment of colon injuries depends on the degree of peritonitis and the severity of concomitant trauma.	0.8870218757975437
Early diagnosed injuries are suitable for primary repair, while deviation stomata or a Hartmann procedure with or without resection should be offered to patients with delayed diagnoses, peritonitis, or severe concomitant diseases.	1.019460240560863
Long-lasting procedures should be abandoned in the emergency situation; in these severe cases, laparotomy should be aimed towards primary "damage control" and followed by definite surgery after stabilization of the patient.	1.1927396802067272
Surgery of the great veins inevitably began with the surgical treatment of injuries, often involving the femoral vein.	1.1262539764070862
Because of the famous case presented by Roux in 1813, the prevailing opinion until almost the end of the nineteenth century was that ligation of the vein made death inevitable, but that the only way to control severe hemorrhaging from a vein was to ligate the femoral artery.	1.059230578852206
Zaufal's principle (1880) consisted in the ligation and resection of great veins of the body and limbs in order to prevent sepsis in suppurative processes.	1.1020661005156456
This surgical method was still being used in the first half of the twentieth century in patients with perforated appendicitis or puerperal fever.	1.031340915507763
In the limb, the congestion induced in the vein had a positve effect on the healing process.	0.9307685438878044
The surgical treatment of leg and pelvic deep vein thrombosis was initially (1931) aimed at achieving decompression in compartment syndromas.	0.8755318479052423
The first thrombectomy was performed in 1937, but several operations with a successful outcome were reported at the 61st annual meeting of the German Society of Surgery in the following year.	1.214422060603584
Bilateral glomus jugulare tumors are rare.	0.6078891459006617
However, their treatment should preserve not only the function of the facial nerve but also the caudal cranial nerves and the middle ears in order to avoid bilateral hearing losses.	1.2936887528366448
Further, venous cerebral drainage has to be ensured in order to avoid cerebral hypertension and hemorrhagic infarction after bilateral jugular ligations.	1.028216823176739
In the case presented bilateral glomus jugulare tumors required super-selective angiography and embolization.	1.0810638088705107
Complete tumor removal on both sides was then possible by a transmastoid-transcervical approach without any further functional deteriorations.	0.9429032660250736
Middle ear function was preserved on both sides by temporary ventral translocation of the posterior wall of the auditory meatus.	0.8777905380982653
As the sigmoid sinus and internal jugular vein had been ligated during initial previous surgery, venous drainage was tested one year later by angiography and compression of the remaining internal jugular vein.	1.0207329560074223
A sufficient collateral circulation was found and permitted surgery on the second side.	0.9304743678857621
Intoxication is the monotone reaction of the CNS to consumed psychoactive substances.	0.8235182319414223
Intoxication-like conditions may also occur without taking drugs.	0.8899495716101472
We then use the term "ecstasy".	0.7419913653199296
Intoxication can follow typical or atypical course.	0.581786485524296
The main symptoms are disturbances of consciousness and orientation and additionally changes of mood, affect, drive and initiative, train of thought and self-control.	0.922455142772136
The diagnosis of intoxication differs from the diagnosis of psychosis because the latter continues its own course, occurs in the absence of psychoactive substances in the organism and always lasts longer than an intoxication.	0.9623952266273195
In a meta-analysis of 69 prospective and retrospective studies, we investigated the value of various surgical techniques in the treatment of lumbar disk herniations.	1.1321221809334687
Androgenetic hair loss is the most frequent reason for the topical application of hair-growth-promoting agents.	1.0253163851254483
Such preparations should arrest or even reverse androgen-induced hair follicle regression as well as prolonging the hair cycles, especially of the shortened anagen phase, and thus protect from increased hair loss.	1.0137366686199158
True evidence of drug effects on hair growth is problematic, since trichograms, the method chiefly applied by the manufacturers, fail to reveal every factor involved in the follicular activity, especially the duration of anagen stage.	1.168834948298022
For example, an increase in the anagen rate does not always reflect a lengthening of the anagen stage, but may also be due to shortened hair cycles.	1.0751889284462681
Accordingly, drug effects on hair growth should be investigated by methods that analyse the cell cycle kinetics.	1.1164433829101268
For this approach DNA-flowcytometry of the outer root sheath in plucked anagen hairs and of complete anagen hair bulbs taken by micropreparative techniques from scalp biopsies offers a reproducible method for quick and reliable evaluation of hair growth.	0.8639041583300178
The calcaneus pseudathrosis is rarly seen in clinical workday and we coundnit find any case be reported.	0.7987839593948265
In two casese the authors present the diagnosis and therapie of a non-union after a calcaneus fracture.	0.9633537432350476
The authors point especially at anatomical characteristics and biomechanical reasons and their meaning for aetiology of pseudathrosis after a calcaneus fracture.	0.8333158761745093
A general review of the results and technique of intraarterial chemotherapy in cases of breast cancer is given.	1.238791547490848
The remission rate for untreated primary tumors is nearly 100%, for completely treated local relapses approximately 70%.	1.100575488124352
The complication rate is quite low using an intraarterial well-tolerated cytostatic agent such as mitoxantrone.	0.9675621266830744
However, thromboembolism of the vertebral artery facing the internal mammary artery may occur.	1.2056801048267114
The indication for intraarterial chemotherapy should always be set by an interdisciplinary board.	0.881032884239762
In the country city of Ansbach, Germany all cases of varicella-zoster virus infection seen by dermatologists, pediatricians and general practitioneers were registered over a period of 16 months, from February 1992 until May 1993.	1.0847483516411973
152 patients were clinically diagnosed with herpes zoster and 437 patients with chickenpox.	0.8494735871763489
The population-based incidence of zoster infections was 22.6 per 10,000 inhabitants per year, while the incidence of chickenpox was 42.4.	1.0475793570806269
There was a slight predominance of male patients with zoster.	1.0314815607006436
There was also a marked influence of age and sex, on the localization of the involved nerve segments.	1.0971994239350633
Zoster was seen in patients of all ages but there was a clear predominance in older patients.	1.2173189692134847
The peak of the disease occurred in the eighth decade.	1.30248095463916
In patients with chickenpox, the sex ratio was equal.	1.0500539562172992
The disease typically occurs in children and we observed a predominance of the cases in the first decade.	1.3097857297004323
Paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes (PNS) are rare disorders of the nervous system that cannot be ascribed to metatastases or to destruction of vital systemic organs by the tumor or its treatment.	0.9821603431864241
Most frequently, PNS occur in association with small-cell lung, breast or ovarian carcinomas.	0.8876705864388688
The most frequent PNS is Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, which at the same time has the highest predictive value concerning an underlying carcinoma.	1.104519665254769
PNS have been classified mostly under anatomical aspects but now are increasingly categorized according to specific antibodies.	0.8704444356902209
In certain neurologic syndromes (sensible and autonomic neuropathy, cerebellitis, limbic encephalitis, Opsoclonus-Myoclonus syndrome, Stiff-man syndrome, neuromyotonia, subacute amaurosis) specific autoantibodies are highly predictive for a neoplasm.	0.9028767532967814
Pathogenic relevance of these autoantibodies has been demonstrated only for antibodies against (1) voltage gated calcium channels (VGCC) in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, (2) voltage gated potassium channels (VGKC) in neuromyotonia, and (3) recoverin in cancer associated retinopathy.	1.0378230375736317
The present article deals with the neurological symptoms of PNS, associated tumors, and the relevance of specific antibodies for the diagnosis and pathogenesis of PNS.	1.320804338401257
Ewing's sarcoma is a very rare tumor which has, however, attracted much oncological interest since the dramatic improvement of its prognosis under chemotherapy.	0.9960885490171454
Its histogenesis has been discussed controversially for a long time, including a possible origin in immature reticulum, myogenous, endothelial and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells.	1.1527470526996322
Repeated reports have also suggested a possible neuroectodermal genesis.	0.8205159642254827
Convincing arguments, however, have only been brought forward during recent years, since it was found that Ewing's sarcoma and malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumor share a common chromosome translocation 11;22.	1.100143247933943
In the meantime this hypothesis has been strengthened by numerous cell biological analyses.	0.8410205822630328
There seems to be no clear border between Ewing's sarcoma and malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumors with definite neural differentiation.	0.8212746065528584
Histological differential diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma has been improved by immunohistological methods.	0.9319488783446602
In most cases, they can be distinguished from lymphoma (leucocyte common antigen, B and T markers) and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (muscle specific actin, desmin) without problems.	1.1545927881032994
Apart from that, it is possible nowadays to obtain antibodies against the MIC 2-protein, which is preferably expressed in Ewing sarcoma.	1.2360895900145807
The diagnostics of Ewing's sarcoma and the malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumor have considerably been enriched by the fact that the specific chromosome translocation t(11;22) can be proved molecular biologically.	1.0058873251819913
In contrast to the cytogenetic evidence, it is not necessary to establish cell cultures.	1.289195891057607
Contrast enhanced (CE) magnetic resonance angiography affords angiographic depiction of extended vascular territories with high quality and diagnostic value.	0.9794102151813823
A prerequisite is the fast acquisition of a three-dimensional gradient-echo data set during the injection of a bolus of a T1-shortening contrast agent.	0.9345806297967212
We describe the dependence of the quality of CE-MRA on technical parameters of different MR-scanners and consider some fundamental facts and practical guidelines concerning the contrast agent injection.	0.9345573833744972
The present study gives a survey of radiological findings after surgical treatment of laryngeal and pharyngeal carcinomas, whereby the surgical procedures and the localisation of tumours found special consideration.	1.131640518665752
Owing to advances in adjuvant therapy, the outlook for patients with primary malignant bone tumors has improved dramatically in recent decades.	0.9412107168248963
This applies both to improved survival and to increased limb salvage rates.	0.9271579822319597
The diagnostic strategies and a staging system for malignant bone tumors are outlined.	1.105759501320282
Technical aspects of the standard limb salvage procedures, such as Tikhoff-Linberg resection at the shoulder, internal hemipelvectomy, proximal and distal femur resection and rotation plasty are presented.	1.011674948503691
The use of soft tissue procedures such as flaps and the use of modular implant systems has reduced the complication rates of limb salvage procedures.	0.919984236080698
In the future we hope to further improve prognosis and quality of life for such patients by the application of risk-adapted strategies for chemotherapy and surgery.	1.1602646391690365
In 10-30 % of cases, locoregional recurrence is accompanied by distant metastasis; a further 25 % develop distant metastasis within the year after diagnosis of recurrence.	1.0866228664380366
In treatment of recurrent tumor in the thoracic wall, axillary or supraclavicular disease surgery plays a major role.	0.9253423055052875
Since - another long-lasting courses occur even in the metastatic situation, recurrence is not an infrequent event, and therapy then needs a multidisciplinary approach.	1.2156793456099293
Surgical techniques such as local, myocutaneous or omental flaps and mesh graft transplantation are used to cover large defects after tumor resection.	0.8673577362431718
Additional and innovative modalities are combined in the management of this complex problem: locoregional or systemic chemotherapy, topical application of chemotherapy, certain radiation regimens and in otherwise resistant tumors the experimental use of photodynamic laser therapy (PDT).	0.9701753676698824
The most important goal hereby is to restore or at least maintain organ function and quality of life.	0.9613139543828582
In acute osteomyelitis of childhood a rapid diagnosis and initiation of antibiotic therapy is necessary in order to prevent late sequelae.	1.0452888846781485
Thus, diagnostic imaging plays a crucial role.	1.2383538405068149
If acute osteomyelitis is suspected in a child, imaging starts with conventional radiography in order to exclude other differential diagnoses.	1.09183679361069
This is followed by sonography for the purpose of diagnosing a subperiosteal abscess or joint fluid from which the causative organism could be isolated.	0.9502277175788844
If the diagnosis is unclear, the next step should be either MRI or 99m Tc-MDP bone scan, depending on the possibility of clinical localization and the site of the suspected lesion.	1.0778775996917145
MRI is superior to bone scan in depicting the exact anatomy, which is extremely important in spinal osteomyelitis and preoperatively.	1.0704963344611893
The bone scan can show the whole skeleton in one examination and should be favored if there is no definite localization or in suspected multifocal osteomyelitis.	0.9888543038811849
Rarely scintigraphy with labeled white blood cells is indicated.	0.7048677592438881
The 67 Ga scan, however, should not be used in children because of the high level of radiation exposure.	1.3172709115006274
The different imaging modalities are described in detail and an imaging diagnostic workup is outlined.	0.9354354288307107
In spite of all interdisciplinary efforts and functionally oriented operation procedures, there are still unsatisfying results in the treatment of cleft lip and palate (CLP) patients.	1.049699039830573
Secondary corrections involve upper lip, nose, and palate (fissures).	0.9361238825250013
In some cases, it is necessary to reposition the complete maxilla.	0.9362345758925796
Finally, there are indications for speech improving measures and total septorhinoplasties.	1.357948960856437
Dental treatment can be brought to a positive end by means of implant-borne prosthodontic work.	0.9729440162476762
In this paper, some of the anatomical and physiologic conditions and surgical procedures are described, which may serve as a basis for a functionally orientated treatment of sequelae after primary CLP care.	1.2118331398590878
Damage to the respiratory system caused by inhalation of toxic products of combustion and the subsequent development of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the main lethal factors in burns patients.	1.0079427387889377
Treatment with exogenous surfactant is one of the therapeutic options.	1.0404539326843574
However, no clinical reports have yet been published about this therapy.	1.2334407055374332
We report on two patients with burn injuries of second to third degree affecting 42% and 48% respectively of the total body surface plus inhalation injury complicated by ARDS.	1.128728736216813
Both patients were treated with bovine surfactant (Alveofact).	0.9358523835958525
The therapeutic effects on oxygenation and pulmonary function were monitored.	0.9675682969901803
Intrabronchial application of surfactant by bronchoscopy during exhaustive conventional mechanical ventilation resulted in improved gas exchange with an increase in arterial O2 pressure (paO2); inspired O2 concentration (FiO2) was lowered and there was an improvement in lung compliance.	1.0062474700901098
Both patients survived this critical situation.	0.6287017471262695
We conclude that treatment with exogenous surfactant in postburn victims with ARDS is a promising therapeutic approach to improve the survival rate of these high-risk patients.	1.1704776041782885
The main aesthetic concern of patients with Angle class II deformities with skeletal deep bite - short face syndrome - is the short lower face.	1.218328540565569
It is the orthodontist's task to correct this deformity insofar as possible.	0.8671338056734026
Depending on the extent, even orthodontists at the beginning of their training will recognize this.	1.16273487678576
Since presurgical orthodontic treatment determines the kind and extent of the surgical procedure, the orthodontist has to plan the treatment in for individual case .	1.089466319336157
It is the purpose of this article to demonstrate a concept of treatment for patients with class II deformities, skeletal deep bite, and a short lower face.	1.3274913895958584
Presurgical orthodontic treatment and the surgical procedure to correct the deformity are discussed.	1.2379790151754146
The treatment results show that it is necessary to leave or to create a certain curve of Spee, depending on the extent of the deformity, to achieve a satisfactory result in terms of to function, aesthetics, and stability.	1.1749727555196638
It can be concluded that it is only possible to reach the preset treatment goals with an exact diagnosis and the knowledge of the necessary preparation in combination with the surgical procedure.	1.2321705415456456
Adequate psychotherapeutic treatment of transsexual patients during the "real- life-test" is crucial for the outcome after sex reassignement surgery.	1.1509868306679636
Necessary modifications are discussed along the concept of "transsexual defense" and the interrelation of identity and disordered gender identity.	1.0579923892584575
Usually therapeuts of transsexual patients, who decide over somatic sex reassignement, have to engage also in psychotherapy in a broad sense.	1.138147978322862
Within the setting of the "administrative-psychotherapeutic split" the psychotherapist leaves the decision over admission to sex reassignement to a therapist specialised in gender identity disorders.	0.8885780321652003
In this setting patients have more time to develop insight and have better chances to explore other options and find individual solutions with regard to irreversible sex reassignement surgery.	0.9075310283987352
During recent years in the German federal social welfare system has been subject to several changes due to structural forms.	0.9760218479790369
The hospital sector - as an element of this system - has also been affected.	1.326574213228097
Based on various legislation the financial framework has been reduced which has led to tendencies of economic limitation and rationalization.	0.8440336855367647
From this background considerable risk selection and changes in emphasis might result.	0.7089301279802809
Cost intensive patients with a high need for treatment are referred as quickly as possible and dicharged to outpatient services despite unknown domestic follow-up care.	1.1317043298757186
Mostly the elderly are affected.	0.7296287201956461
Medical rehabilitation can be found in this system at the cut between SGB V and SGB XI.	0.9655702850987186
However, this division raises problems and discussions concerning benefit payment (rehabilitation before nursing, priority of home, etc.).	0.9042408766556249
Right in rehabilitation the most important thing is an overlap of sectors.	0.926546594175687
Various medical, nursing and other social supplies have to be put into a network to achieve an integral treatment of patients that focuses on the individual situation.	1.1020753025567547
In 1995 the Ethics Commission of the Medical University of LÃ¼beck was asked to rule on whether a preimplantation diagnostic procedure (PID) could be performed on a husband and wife who were both carriers of the cystic fibrosis mutation  F508.	1.0203979166063062
The couple had previously given birth to a child with cystic fibrosis and had twice terminated a pregnancy following prenatal screening.	0.9026113994547508
Ethically, the performance of a PID was certainly warranted for this couple.	0.9315761473694015
The risk of violating Â§Â§8 Section 1 and/or 2 Section 1 ("totipotent cells shall not be removed for diagnostic purposes") of the Law for the Protection of Embryos (ESchG) was judged to be nonexistent in written statements from two expert witnesses (Prof. K.V.	1.146101417988342
Hinrichsen and Prof. H.M. Beier, both embryologists).	0.9333165223293367
In the view of the Ethics Commission, only Â§1 Section 2 ("an ovum shall be fertilized only for the purpose of inducing pregnancy") of the ESchG currently prohibits PIDs.	1.3232137659455934
In light of the social and biological arguments in favor of PIDs, however, the Ethics Commission questioned whether this section of the ESchG is still morally justifiable.	1.042939869227221
A 38 year old male patient with a coarctation of the aorta was successfully operated using an ascending aorta-abdominal aorta bypass (AAAAB).	1.0586731934576905
The diagnosis of a severe postisthmic stenosis had been confirmed by aortography.	1.0085346150943804
Preoperatively the patient suffered from extreme hypertension and claudicatio intermittens.	0.6618714442668662
After prosthetic repair of coarctation, blood pressure became normotensive and claudicatio intermittens disappeared.	0.930868499352831
In this report, we discuss various surgical techniques and the most important question concerning the optimal timing of surgical repair of aortic coarctation.	1.2196806893807859
Iatrogenic colonic perforation is a rare but very dangerous complication of colonoscopy.	0.9820703319087922
We report on eleven prospectivly recorded patients treated between 1994 and 1998.	1.134506612553812
In seven cases the colonoscopy had been done for diagnostic and in four cases for therapeutic reason.	1.0099068737510057
Nine women and two men (age range 56 to 92 years) were affected.	1.0723440041025976
In 77 % the perforation was found in the sigmoid colon.	1.1793037229595682
All patients were operated on and five sutures, five resections and one colostomy were performed.	0.9727914049807942
No significant differences could be shown in six patients with classical perforation compared with five patients presenting with prolonged abdominal pain.	1.1186218384354665
Only duration of symptoms was significantly different in the two groups.	0.9069952053040327
Three patients (85, 90 and 92 years) died from late complications.	1.116454009184094
Indications of MR arthrography were analyzed in this prospective study.	0.9464920611539597
The aim was to evaluate possible advantages over conventional MRI, establish diagnostic criteria and to analyze its meaning further for the therapeutic management of postoperative patients.	1.192335841278904
Nerve fibre-neuroendocrine cell complexes (NF-NEC-C's) are neuroendocrine cells located in the lamina propria of the gastrointestinal tract directly connected with nerve fibres of Meissner's plexus.	0.9274004802059477
We report on a patient with sporadic Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) with electron microscopically demonstrated multiple NF-NEC-C's in non-antral gastric mucosa.	0.9084326449893325
It is suspected that in ZES the hypergastrinaemia may represent a trophic stimulus for the proliferation of NF-NEC-C's in the gastric mucosa.	0.8368214247730182
Introduction: The prehospitaly initiated endotracheal intubation and controlled ventilation, is especially in multi-system-trauma cases, recognized to be the "gold standard".	1.067876576367703
Thus especially in view of the increasing demands being placed upon the quality of prehospital emergency treatment in general, the quality of such prehospital induced ventilation, is becoming of increasing importance.	1.086355443822598
Thereby we must take into consideration the limited possabilities, which are afflicted with a high degree of uncertainess, which we have at our disposal to effectively evaluate the efficiency of emergency ventilation.	1.2339038150601216
The purpose of our study within a collective of severely traumatized patients, was to determine the quality of prehospitaly induced ventilation with regards to the adequacy of oxygenation and ventilation and as a result of our findings, to identify areas for procedural optimization.	1.1524229521588172
Staging of any tumor, i.e.	0.46550864593580166
determination of the extent of the disease, serves to select the patients who might profit from curative surgical intervention or to define those patients with inoperable carcinomas who should be referred for other therapies, such as chemotherapy or irradiation.	1.0548292835713258
Furthermore, accurate staging is necessary for assessment of prognosis, for radiation therapy planning, and for differentiation of those with small-cell lung cancer or for follow-up examinations of small-cell lung cancer patients after during and after chemotherapy.	1.3340925909893298
The primary radiological staging and diagnostic modalities for assessment of bronchial carcinomas are computed tomography (CT) of the thorax including liver and adrenal glands, abdominal sonography, and bone scintigraphy.	1.1809157098150458
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be reserved for specific indications, e.g.	0.639559330272632
infiltration of the chest wall or staging of patients with intolerance/allergy to intravenous contrast medium.	1.033634849809303
The clinical value of nuclear medicine techniques, such as [18F]2-fluoride-2-desoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) for evaluation of lymph nodes and distant metastases, In-111 octreotide/somatostatin receptor scans for staging of small-cell lung cancer, and thallium-201 SPECT are currently being assessed in numerous studies, although these techniques are already in routine use.	1.1117439117925465
In future these or nuclear medicine techniques, as well as techniques using molecular-based contrast material, especially for MR imaging, currently in experimental status, may yield serious potential for staging purposes.	0.9877149110069857
Background: We investigated fundus autofluorescence in vivo using a novel scanning laser ophthalmoscope.	1.194090545869888
Myocardial infarctions may be precipitated by external triggers.	0.6514464100273063
External triggers include physical activity and emotional stress as well as other infrequent triggers such as war threats or earthquakes.	0.8938199065899671
Changes in the environment also play an important role in the incidence of myocardial infarctions; circadian, seasonal, and weekly variations have been observed.	0.9671039328546615
Patients' behavior at the onset of symptoms depends on various factors and influences outcome and mortality.	0.984841802005882
Appropriate preventive measures are indicated in order to protect patients during vulnerable periods.	0.9973674384728015
Health education should be directed towards patients' behavior and promptly seeking medical assistance at the onset of symptoms.	0.8569570583999951
Introduction: In patients with neuroendocrine gastrointestinal tumors and liver metastases, but without known extrahepatic manifestations, liver transplantation may be indicated as curativ or "long-term-palliativ" therapy.	1.2141525189908986
For these patients the absence of bone lesions is mandatory.	1.0950581070960261
A patient suffering from long-standing pustular psoriasis of the palms was treated for 3 weeks with a mercury-containing drug.	1.0205546410897217
Exacerbation into generalized pustular psoriasis developed.	0.5489689230381373
Mercury levels in blood and urine were increased.	0.8625608063608861
After withdrawal of the mercury preparation, therapy with DMPA (2,3-Dimercapto-1-propane-sulfonic acid), a mercury antidote, was initiated, together with short-term treatment with aromatic retinoids and PUVA.	1.2238597848127497
Within a few days mercury levels decreased significantly and the skin lesions practically disappeared.	1.1287465646175767
Based on the results of chromosome analysis from cell cultures and testis biopsies, the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in infertile men is up to 20%.	0.9796812563336711
Chromosomal analysis from peripheral blood cultures is a routine procedure while the analysis of meiotic chromosomes is labor intensive and mainly used in a scientific setting.	1.0171465717172583
Of all infertile males, 7-9% show numerical and/or structural chromosomal abnormalities in their peripheral blood lymphocytes.	1.056359136271763
There is an inverse correlation between sperm count and the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities, with 21% of patients with non-obstructive azoospermia having a chromosomal abnormality, most often Klinefelter's syndrome.	1.1556340610734244
The rate of patients with chromosomal abnormalities is only 9% in patients with severe oligozoospermia (less than 5 million/ml), and structural abnormalities are found more often in this group.	1.1930003365975799
Using fluorescence in situ analysis the number of selected chromosomes can be assayed in single sperm cells.	0.8643539403552937
There is no consensus on whether infertile men have a higher proportion of aneuploid (disomic) sperm cells than fertile men.	0.9650302854625288
Taking into account the results from meiotic studies in infertile men, an increased rate of aneuploid sperm cells is likely.	1.0716929068381709
Chromosomal analysis should be performed on all infertile men being treated with ICSI as the result of this analysis could have important consequences in their reproductive decisions.	1.0529139897948732
Background: Tufted angioma represents a benign vascular lesion of the skin.	1.1539100959706838

Limb lengthening in dwarfism has become a standardised procedure with a good prognosis.	0.7983632966905182
In most cases external fixation is used.	0.8692634873303164
Gain of leg length up to 15 cm and more is possible in the lower leg and the femur and 8.5 cm in the humerus.	1.3026889386181055
Limb lengthening is useful in many cases of dwarfism due to skeletal dysplasia.	0.9303879342928768
There are a number of risks and possible complications involved and the procedure also requires considerable time.	0.9633429230337087
We report the results of 48 patients with dwarfism operated on in the OrthopÃ¤dische Kinderklinik Aschau (Orthopaedic Hospital for Children).	1.0335263641115495
Process-Experiential (PE) therapy is a neo-humanistic treatment that strives to maintain a creative tension between a client-centered emphasis on a genuine, prizing, empathic relationship and the active, task-focused process-directive style of Gestalt therapy.	0.5338090966963029
A research-informed treatment (Grawe 1997), its theory of function and dysfunction has been updated via contributions from contemporary psychological theory.	0.7674601594026085
It incorporates a set of key therapeutic tasks, each of which is characterized by a specific client marker and resolution state, series of steps clients pass through on their way to resolution, and therapist interventions used to facilitate client progress through those steps.	0.5587336475520397
The first part of this review provides an overview of Process-Experiential therapy, including theoretical foundation, that is, emotion theory, dialectical constructivism, and task analytic process orientation, and the basic treatment principles.	1.247912083466698
Malnutrition is a common finding amongst our elders.	1.0327734612667214
The causes of malnutrition are multifactorial and although they have been extensively studied, they are not entirely understood.	1.0822095210331122
Both physiological and pathological processes of aging put this population at a higher risk of being undernourished.	0.9026083909935326
These may be related to social, financial, psychological and/or physiological changes directly or indirectly associated to growing old.	0.9640969942924538
We report on a 76-year-old female patient with clinical findings consistent with necrolytic migratory erythema.	1.1427068979060406
Plasma glucagon levels were slightly elevated, but advanced radiologic techniques revealed no evidence of an underlying pancreatic tumour.	0.989216948806726
The dermatosis responded excellently to oral therapy with dapsone.	0.7769309274042767

Objective: Hypoplastic left heart (HLH) is a complex developmental malformation of the left ventricle, aorta, and associated valves.	1.3008602780060057
Survival beyond neonatal period is the exception in untreated infants.	0.8164829287278821
The prognosis, however, is no longer hopeless.	1.0569556373322324
Clinical stabilization of a neonate with HLH is appropriate until a management decision, based on appropriate parental counselling, can be made.	0.9414783325233197
Forty-one patients demonstrating clinical symptoms for cerebral infarction were investigated by magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion-weighted echo-planar imaging (DWI) and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI).	1.1184107022987617
In 8 patients only DWI showed the cerebral lesions clearly.	0.8789920145341877
One patient with positive DWI and T2WI suffered from HSV encephalitis.	0.8622325412770335
DWI is superior to T2WI in assessment of small cortical infarcts and cerebral infarction in patients with preexisting vascular lesions.	0.8811360988954038
DWI is not specific, so other causes like cerebral hematoma and encephalitis have to be considered.	0.9813134692254132
Juvenile polyposis was first described by Cronkhite and Canada in 1955.	0.805557044979242
This disease is characterized by juvenile intestinal polyps and ectodermal abnormalities.	0.7516023388312484
The etiology of Cronkhite-Canada syndrome (CCS), however, is still not well understood.	1.2843901503157782
Interestingly, among patients with CCS a significant correlation (16.5 %) with intestinal carcinomas has been observed.	1.1429237950392706
Thus, malignant transformation and/or genetic predisposition may be involved in the initiation of the disease.	1.0534884893059406
In the following, epidemiology, symptoms, morphology and therapy of CCS are discussed.	1.0443112729049886
Our examinations are based on studies reported in the literature and on a case report of a female patient who developed a colon carcinoma 2 years after initial diagnosis of CCS.	1.285245397207275
Pacemaker erythema is a rare, irreversible side effect of cardiac pacemakers, clinically characterized by epifocal teleangiectatic erythema.	0.9414134553553836
Histology reveals teleangiectatic vessels in the superficial dermis and a slight perivascular infiltrate.	0.8210543344680277
We report on three patients presenting with pacemaker erythema following either pacemaker or defibrillator implantation.	1.0580567544252322
The pathogenesis of this histopathologically uncharacteristic lesion is unknown.	0.8822040940334916
In contrast to peri- or postoperative pacemaker infections, physical irritation can be considered a possible triggering mechanism.	1.2788912205065062
Allergic reactions to the implanted material have been ruled out by negative patch test results.	0.8427416608419556
The present legal requirements for the prescription of controlled drugs remains an impediment to adequate therapy for chronic pain because of an abundance of legal regulations.	0.9621289088175442
The physician prescribing opioids must consider the permitted maximum amount per prescription, the period of time the drug is prescribed for, numerous cross references, and other special regulations, and he still cannot be sure that he does not violate certain legal requirements.	1.0592641122334918
Often these difficulties result in withholding necessary pain treatment!	0.6525665450704297
In the authors' opinion it should be sufficient to write a specific prescription form for controlled drugs in the same way as any other ordinary prescription without jeopardizing the safety of the drug control system.	1.045334265265656
It is important that the use of the narcotic be justified in the sense of Â§ 13 Abs.	0.9481981467408014
1 of the drug control regulation, as judged by the responsible prescriber of the drug, and that any offence be punished.	1.325306547801533
The use of triplicate prescriptions guarantees sufficient proof.	0.6475976700906526
Legislation is requested that will substitute for the present drug control regulations, which are difficult to handle.	1.1463972275234584
The aim of the study was to investigate the ability to activate the quadriceps femoris muscle voluntarily in patients after severe knee injuries and it's influence on muscle function.	0.9996630362196113
33 male patients after ACL-rupture with concomitant injuries were investigated with a twitch-interpolation-method to determine the maximal voluntary contraction force (MVC) and the ability to activate the quadriceps muscle voluntarily.	1.0863498384817634
The results were compared to a previously investigated group of patients after isolated ACL-rupture and to an aged-matched control group.	1.1597760510964048
Managed care, i.e., the integration of health insurance and delivery of care under the direction of one organization, is gaining importance in the USA health market.	1.072522401248871
The initial effects consisted of a decrease in insurance premiums, a very attractive feature for employers.	0.960793532480269
Managed care promises to contain expenditures for health care.	0.5547862696502655
Given the shrinking public resources in Germany, managed care seems attractive for the German health system, too.	0.7412773996790419
In this review the development of managed care, the principal elements, forms of organisation and practical tools are outlined.	1.085728817720239
The regulation of the delivery of care by means of controlling and financial incentives threatens the autonomy of physicians: the physician must act as a "double agent", caring for the interest for the individual patient and being restricted by the contract with the managed care organisation.	1.103129547589163
Cost containment by managed care was achieved by reducing the fees for physicians and hospitals (and partly by restricting care for patients).	0.9377898805259828
Only a fraction of this cost reduction was handed over to the enrollee or employer, and most of the money was returned with profit to the shareholders of the managed care organisations.	0.9404477732385244
The preeminent role of primary care physicians as gatekeepers of the health network led to a reduced demand for specialist services in general and for university hospitals and anesthesiologists in particular.	1.028900461668244
The paradigm of managed care, i.e., to guide the patient and the care giver through the health care system in order to achieve cost-effective and high quality care, seems very attractive.	1.2081597445284689
The stress on cost minimization by any means in the daily practice of managed care makes it doubtful if managed care should be an option for the German health system, in particular because there are a number of restrictions on it in German law.	1.0427630844641922
Background: Analysis of the impact of head fractures, intracranial hemorrhages, brain edema, and prognostic risk factors on long-term outcome in children with severe head injury.	1.1984290431775944
Background: In the past, the main problem of transscleral cyclophotocoagulation was related to the energy dosage of the individual effect.	1.3595725436802684
Since the target tissue is not directly observable, no information about the coagulation process was available to the surgeon.	1.0529019014654695
High inter- and intraindividual variations of the tissue properties often led to under- or overdosage.	1.1475128817840246
Underdosage is therapeutically useless, while overdosage causes the so-called "popeffects" which may induce severe damage to the eye.	1.0415561297181617
In the past, most scientific or routine studies on heart rate variability (HRV) were done using commercial Holter ECG devices with traditional magnetic tapes.	1.0214441349841443
All methods to calculate parameters of HRV are based on the measurement of time intervals between successive sinus cardiac beats, in practice RR intervals.	1.0614194656638594
Hence, results of HRV calculation depend on the quality of primary data acquisition.	1.0210062461355514
However, technical standards on accuracy of RR interval acquisition in magnetic tape and digital solid state Holter ECG systems do not exist as yet.	1.0936588968609224
Therefore in a laboratory investigation accuracy of HRV parameter calculation after traditional standard tape with and without real-time analysis and digital solid state data acquisition was compared in three commercial Holter ECG systems [Ela medical (E), Oxford Medilog Excel (O) and Medset Cardiolight (M)].	1.03511062751005
A computer-based ECG simulator was used to synthesize a test signal consisting of artificial P-QRS complexes of fixed rate, quartz stabilized "sinus rhythms".	0.8659346946343613
Two channel analog tape and digital 24h recordings of the fixed rate test signal were performed simultaneously.	0.804197808133339
The influence of recording technology on accuracy of RR interval measurement and consequently on time domaine HRV was shown by comparing five standard 24-h time domain parameters.	0.8939423130990103
As expected, in the three Holter systems the analog tape recordings showed a higher, technically induced, artificial RR variability.	1.0648004925336365
The SDNN values (E: 9.38ms vs 2.68ms; p<0.001; O: 3.89ms vs 0.97ms; p<0.001; M: 10.47ms vs 2.89ms; p=0.001), SDNN-Index values (E: 8.22ms vs 0.90ms; p<0.001; O: 3.75ms vs 0.90ms; p<0.001; M: 7.81ms vs 1.49ms, p<0.001) and RMSSD-values (E: 10.39ms vs 2.16ms; p<0.001; O: 10.05ms vs 1.88ms, p<0.001; M: 8.62ms vs 1.69ms; p<0.001) were significantly lower if acquisition was done by digital solid devices in all systems, SDANN (M: 9.83ms vs 5.37ms; p<0.001) in the Medset system too.	0.9936182436269705
The used method is a possible way to validate commercial Holter ECG systems for HRV analysis.	0.9369175566759975
Clinical significance of artifical HRV seems to be low.	0.8335300373292786
Cases of gallstone ileus (108) were analyzed retrospectively over 30 years.	1.1344202108547667
Even today, when laparoscopic cholecystectomy is done, the incidence of this rare disease remains the same.	1.1756325175942424
History, clinical and X-ray findings are non-specific.	0.8699938771403887
Aerobilia was seen in 17 % of the patients.	0.8385475765253908
Since 1992 sonography has proveded an exact diagnosis in 10 of 15 cases.	0.9388738926350401
In the triad of known gallstone, non-specific epigastric pain with assumed small intestinal obstruction, and impossible detection of a stone in the gallbladder, there is strong suspicion of a gallstone ileus.	1.0849556949064987
The evidence is given if the gallstone is seen in the bowels.	0.8830013856039813
Intraoperatively more than one stone was found in the intestines in 20 %, and cholecystoduodenal fistulas were encountered in 83 %.	1.1449501338081856
There has been no significant change in mortality for 30 years.	0.9754964492122062
Autologous transplantation in brachial plexus injuries has become significantly more efficacious through increased knowledge of the microtopographic anatomy of the fascicle structures and the refinement of microneurosurgical techniques.	0.8612069060758358
Recovery of shoulder and upper arm functions can be achieved with autologous transplantation in the majority of patients under optimized conditions.	1.1277396870689473
However, attempts to restore forearm, hand and finger functions in this way have been disappointing so far.	1.2552698047276618
Therapeutic success is primarily governed by early decision making, selection of adequate surgical strategies and intensive and longlasting postoperative management.	0.9188600051247381
Leg venectasia is a common problem.	0.6953350781819126
Although there are a variety of therapeutic modalities, none of them gives satisfactory results.	0.9602113531898331
The effects of sclerotherapy in the treatment of telangiectasia with a small diameter are poor.	0.9072637247120704
Electrocoagulation and argon laser treatment often result in scarring.	0.6873708019812945
We studied the effectiveness of the flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser at a wavelength of 585 nm in the treatment of leg venectasia.	0.9226472433631484
After repeated treatments using this laser system, only 30% of the vessels that looked blue on clinical examination could be removed; we obtained better lightening of smaller red, telangiectatic vessels with a diameter up to 0.4 mm.	1.2067508719603945
However, hyperpigmentation frequently developed after treatment.	1.2123031477184762
In post-treatment biopsies, occlusion of the vessels was found.	0.9639177695714051
Based on these results, we recommend a combined therapy for leg venectasia.	1.2139898001897562
Larger diameter vessels should be treated with sclerotherapy, while finer telangiectasia can be treated with the flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser.	1.0177785507328794
Total hip replacement is often recommended for the treatment of femoral neck fractures in elderly patients.	0.8249050903364266
A less invasive approach with shorter operating time is the replacement of the femoral head only, leaving the acetabular cartilage in situ.	0.9889913723271964
Hemiarthroplastic hip replacement using a metallic head prosthesis was not successful in the past, because the majority of patients developed protrusio acetabuli after surgery.	1.1568712943398944
In the present study hemiarthroplastic hip replacement using an Al2O3-ceramic head was shown to be a useful method for the treatment of femoral neck fractures in elderly patients.	0.959115853295493
From 1985 to 1990 277 patients were treated with hemiarthroplasty.	0.8846358535955477
The average age at the time of accident and operation was 81.7 years.	1.094927628207847
At the time of follow-up in 1993 only 77 survivors were available for examination.	0.995112446296771
A standardized score was calculated assessing activity, gait, hip pain, etc., with the patients obtaining an average score of 58 out of a possible 78 points.	1.1868428092521972
Only three patients had hip pain, and in four cases the roentgenographic examination revealed protrusio acetabuli.	1.2270275145585696
Two of these four patients underwent revision surgery for replacement of the cup, leaving the stem in situ.	0.8531530505084254
In view of the small number of approach-related complications, hemiarthroplastic hip replacement using an Al2O3-ceramic head is the recommended surgical treatment for femoral neck fractures in elderly patients.	0.8858121001636464
In the rare patient with protrusio acetabuli, revision surgery can be performed to replace the cup, leaving the stem in situ.	0.8518972844901385
Functional relaxation (FE), a somato-psychotherapeutic method, can reduce asthmatic symptoms.	1.085154263622194
The efficiency of a 5 minute introduction of elements of functional relaxation (EFE) is compared with a placebo-relaxation-method not based on the hypothetical mechanisms of FE, and a standardised pharmacological bronchodilative test using salbutamol.	1.200100056904019
In a controlled prospective randomised single blind setting 18 children and adolescents with acute asthma were treated on three consecutive days with each method.	0.944151196284615
Before and ten minutes after therapy the patients had bodyplethysmographic pulmonary function testing.	1.0308802126496783
U-Tests showed that the baseline measurements were comparable.	0.8545483649490998
The before-after-comparison revealed significant changes for EFE and salbutamol, not for the placebo-relaxation.	0.9274587199209917
There were significant differences between the intraindividual differences of the airway resistance and the specific airway resistance between salbutamol and the placebo-relaxation, not between EFE and salbutamol or EFE and the placebo-relaxation.	0.9861589201746194
FE can be an effective complementary treatment in children or adolescents with asthma.	1.0436348965161673

Assessment of life satisfaction was done by means of a proven valid and reliable test instrument (FLZ - "Fragen zur Lebenszufriedenheit").	1.1581988379252777
Further specific questions on treatment satisfaction, aesthetic result, occupation and income were added to this questionnaire.	0.8378541040909139
Significant discrepancies of the items recreational activities, income, occupation and partnership, productivity, mobility and pain were evaluated in comparison to available data of healthy west german population.	0.9852814178773956
The calculated global index of life satisfaction and health differed significantly from the established index of west german population.	0.8809162251406406
Although specific aspects like aesthetic result, donor site morbidity, pain and even function were critically judged, 91 % of the patients were satisfied with the long term result of the treatment.	1.2098464008143905
None of the patients thought that an initial amputation probably might have been a better solution.	1.1488734217735803

The immunoreactivity of all examined collagen types is stronger in glaucomatous eyes.	0.8118440431092236
The axon basement membranes show an irregular and interrupted pattern.	0.6610781408596836
The number of proliferating cells with positive GFAP staining in glaucomatous cribriform plates is distinctly higher.	0.8213400961670219
We postulate that fibroblasts and astrocytes in the stroma of glaucomatous lamina cribrosa could be stimulated to increased and uncontrolled proliferation.	0.8914753735666288
Associated disorganization and raised secretion of extracellular matrix may lead to axon constriction and, secondarily, to neural degeneration.	0.8749976697332074
Concomitant pathologies (labral lesions, intra-/extra-osseous ganglia and stress bone marrow edema) in adult residual hip dysplasia (RHD) might influence the outcome of conservative hip surgery.	1.0500309121162286
The aim of our prospective clinical study was to assess the value of preoperative MR arthrography in diagnosing concomitant lesions and in making surgical decisions in RHD.	1.1411693776103804
The first 37 consecutive patients with a minimum follow-up of 18 months have been analysed.	1.24972380632094
All 37 patients presented RHD with the clinical symptomatology of labral lesions and underwent routine preoperative MRA.	0.9464549950104357
According to clinical, radiological and MR arthrographical criteria, these 37 patients were subdivided into four therapeutic subgroups: (1) reorientation of the acetabulum using the TÃ¶nnis triple pelvic osteotomy (TPO); (2) intertrochanteric varisation osteotomy (IVO); (3) palliative decompression with only symptomatic partial resection of the torn labrum (PALL); (4) primary total hip replacement (TEP).	1.0177930673103908
Based on the preliminary clinical and radiological outcomes of these four subgroups, the following conclusions can be drawn: labral lesions are considered to be a sign of chronic joint instability.	1.0896577830308023
Therefore, acetabular malorientation should be corrected by redirectional osteotomy of the acetabulum (TPO-subgroup) even in low grades of RHD if labral lesions are present.	1.0722915386318397
"Palliative" labral resections without corrective osteotomy (PALL subgroup) in secondary osteoarthritis due to RHD are definitively obsolete, because they rapidly progress to severe osteoarthritis due to surgically accelerated joint instability.	0.9907903108637213
In RHD with highly osteoarthritic hip joints and concomitant lesions, one should not hesitate to perform primary THR even in young patients.	0.9807452243462943
Severe infections of the talus are often associated with complete septic collapse of the talus.	0.8814860577057458
In this connection, open fractures with defects or significant comminution have a bad prognosis is as far as reconstruction of the talus is concerned.	1.0835041599633966
In the Department of Traumatology, Braunschweig, in 1995 three patients (all male, average age 35.3 +/- 10.2 years) were treated with cancellous bone grafting after talectomy performed because of infection and complete septic collapse of the talus.	1.0520268698551876
In two of these cases third-degree open total dislocation of the talus had been sustained.	1.2497179185694502
The third patient came to us after undergoing arthroscopy of the ankle region in another hospital.	1.0120942095489263
In each case a fulminating infection was the outcome.	0.8313388378893558
Following a step-by-step algorithm, in a first step urgent radical debridement with talectomy was done.	1.0747113331487703
To maintain approximation between the tibia and calcaneus on one side and the os naviculare on the other, the bony defect was filled with PMMA chains and the external fixateur technique was used for immobilization during treatment of the infection.	1.1419239308477815
After second- and third-look procedures a free flap was grown for soft tissue coverage within the first 10 days.	1.0317721847161312
After 17.6 +/- 3.3 days the talus was replaced with a cancellous bone graft, combined with double arthrodesis in two cases, and external fixation for the next 4-5 weeks.	1.1301403406651498
In the third patient a triple arthrodesis was done.	0.9062411516912349
At follow-up after an average of 12 months (range 8-17 months), the bone graft with arthrodesis had been completely integrated in all cases.	1.251465500876313
All patients are free of symptoms in normal life.	1.0006943751954354
In the case of severe open fractures of the talus with significant comminution combined with infection and septic bone collapse conservation of the talus is often impossible.	1.1569942477215702
The combination of homologous cancellous bone grafting and arthrodesis after talectomy is therefore a good method of keeping any decrease in the function of the foot to a minimum.	1.0366203939105878
Meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis was diagnosed in a 63 year old female in Austria.	1.0205115904495359
Sixteen months after onset she still suffers from ataxia, disturbance of gait and bilateral hearing impairment.	0.8417741358795406
Being a farmer, the patient belongs to a recognized high-risk-group, as most other infected people do.	1.3080678734989768
To the best of our knowledge, there has been no report of a human infection by Streptococcus suis in Austria so far.	0.9477643531863761
The results of neurophysiological tests excluded a direct lesion to the cochlea during the acute phase of meningitis, and thus, are in contrast to the guinea-pig-model by Kay, who showed suppurative labyrinthitis being the cause of hearing loss.	1.2882310733081315
The present knowledge of Streptococcus suis meningitis with respect to neurophysiology, pathogenesis, epidemiology and increasing resistance against antibiotics is discussed.	0.8366102611623826
The introduction of atypical antipsychotics has presented new options for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenic patients.	0.8834015990315057

Numerous epidemiological studies about multiple trauma patients do not include an analysis of patients under the age of 18.	1.137670487837053
To study this, the data of 682 patients with multiple traumata, treated between 1981 and 1991 at Hannover Medical School, Germany, were retrospectively analyzed.	1.1696127870084596
The patients were divided into four age-related groups: preschool age (< 6 years), school age (< 13 years), teenagers (< 18 years) and adults (L 18 years).	1.351930598515252
Analyzed were the cause of trauma, localization of injuries and the cause of death.	1.0630847393345457
Children were less often injured as passengers in cars, but more often injured as pedestrians and bicyclists than adults.	0.9431951935930146
However, children showed a significant higher mortality than adults, with threefold increased risk of death when they injured as passengers in car accidents.	1.3629020103383256
In all groups injuries to the head and the legs were most common.	1.1844425827900058
Children showed a lower incidence of trauma to the thorax, abdomen, hip and arms than the adult group.	0.9690352106118263
Nevertheless, trauma to the thorax, abdomen and head was associated with the highest risk of death in all groups.	1.2113634038191972
Spinal cord injuries, especially injuries to the neck, also showed a high risk of death.	1.299755278388881
Children younger than 6 years had the most severe head injuries.	1.0989588440202647
Safety improvements for children in cars, helmet usage on bicycles and early training in traffic safety for children might decrease the lethality in this group of trauma patients.	0.9489809972783019
During the past 7 years 45 patients have been operated upon using the Childs-Phillips method.	0.9875024857187279
Of those, 37 were subsequently examined for the study - 7 patients had died in the meantime.	1.310823168528739
None of the deaths occurred as a direct result of transmesenteric small-bowel plication.	1.0688524988529313
An early recurrence of intestinal obstruction occurred in 4.4 % and a laparotomy was repeated.	1.3142847896808962
During the most recent examinations 86.5 % of those patients checked had (virtually) no complaints - 91.9 % based upon the Visick classification.	1.2662132236742394
A subtotal intestinal obstruction occurred during the period of the study in 8.1 % of cases, but could be conservatively treated.	1.218900927114857
Up until the most recent examination there were still no instances of a late recurrence.	1.0383500164551276
Most intestinal obstruction recurrences are due to errors specific to the technique and are early recurrences.	0.9124949473930822

The further development of 162 stroke patients (average age 77 years), who were geriatrically assessed during hospitalization, was evaluated ca.	1.2875318798522832
Questionnaires were mailed to patients.	0.42552861530632136
53% of the patients (n = 86) returned the questionnaire duly filled in; 20% (n = 32) had died; in the remaining 27% of cases (n = 44) no information was obtained on further development.	1.3548635910133904
80% of those patients who responded lived at home despite numerous medical problems.	1.1372188844912738
Family members assumed most of the care required.	0.8033062859661662
Follow-up treatment and pain therapy proved to be particularly problematic.	1.1749367043961476
The Barthel Index according to data collected was significantly lower compared to figures noted upon release from the hospital.	0.8440426135487222
Hardly anyone among those patients received follow-up treatment.	1.0394998756724791
74% of patients complained of pain although the majority has regular contacts with the family doctor.	1.1556460133600421
For those patients who died in the 18 months interval, significantly lower values for the activities of daily living (ADL) has already been recorded upon hospitalization.	1.1393753138526659
They had a less favorable view of their state of health and were less satisfied with life in general.	1.0594250186204652
The routine staging work-up for renal cancer includes a contrast-enhanced multiphasic spiral CT and a chest radiograph.	1.0448326666950587
If there is doubt regarding the presence and extent of (supradiaphragmatic) IVC thrombus, MR imaging should be performed.	1.0160123713904374
Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging should be used in place of CT in any patient with severe renal dysfunction, symptomatic polycystic kidney disease, or a history of allergy to iodinated contrast media.	1.1502863603869506

Patients: We report on four infants with nonketotic hyperglycinemia, three with a neonatal form and one with the milder infantile form.	1.2021922948212957
Despite early diagnosis and persistent therapy including dextromethorphan and sodium benzoate, two infants with the neonatal form deteriorated progressively and died at the age of 16 and 50 months, respectively, only one survived severely retarded with seizures, opisthotonus and spastic quadriplegia.	1.0306768804935509
The serum concentrations of glycine decreased following sodium benzoate treatment but cerebrospinal fluid/serum glycine ratio remained elevated with no improvement in clinical outcome.	0.8317085916965914
The patient with the infantile form has been treated for over three years with dextromethorphan, and is now a severely retarded child without seizure activity and continuous psychomotor development.	1.173470322524268
Immunosuppression-related Candida infections may be most successfully treated using biological response modifiers and recombinant cytokines to enhance expression of host pro-inflammatory and antimicrobial mediators, notably tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-), interleukin 1 (IL-1), and gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN).	1.0322825908525721
Important but unappreciated differences in the immunopathophysiology of fungal vs. bacterial infections make such cytokine priming appear contrary to current strategies for reducing cytokine-mediated organ injury and mortality due to gram-negative bacteremia and endotoxemia.	0.8725321351350296
Optimistically, preclinical studies to date have found that the coadministration of such immunoadjuvants does not compromise, and actually may improve, the efficacy of synthetic antifungals.	1.052408308047259
Such combination therapies should continue to be evaluated in animal models of Candida infection which otherwise progress to lethal shock or chronic disseminated disease despite aggressive use of existing antifungal agents.	0.8984384302279973
Bilateral neck exploration is the standard procedure in primary hyperparathyroidism.	0.9842546621244321

Prehospital thrombolysis is often recommended for patients in whom a major time gain of >90 min compared to in-hospital therapy is expected.	1.0929595513515435
It has been repeatedly shown by metropolitan rescue services that very early presentation after onset of symptoms in a high percentage of patients offers an additional chance for optimizing thrombolytic therapy.	1.0091874000451027
More than half of all patients presenting with an acute myocardial infarction to the EMS may be treated within 90 min after symptom onset, enabling preservation of major myocardial areas at risk.	1.142639582310526
Thus, prehospital thrombolysis in metropolitan areas offers a chance to take advantage of an ideal time window, without additional risk.	1.1172941767414262
Moreover, technical and diagnostic preconditions are easily fulfilled.	1.1846344220563985
Low resection and intersphincteric extirpation of rectal cancer in the distal third of the rectum has become an accepted sphincter-saving method.	1.1094794798938834

The published data regarding deployment success rates for VS, AS, PC and DU are in the range of 88%, 91%, 90% and 98% up to 100%, respectively.	1.2842002814236266
Times to hemostasis were 5-13', 2-4', 11-19' and 4-14', accompanied by times to mobilization of 6-9h, 6-8h, 4-7h and 2-6h.	1.2121146256288575
Minor complications were described in 8%, 5.9%, 5.3% and 2.1%, major complications in 5.3%, 1.3%, 4% and 2.6%.	1.6278896842293
Although none of the closure devices has been shown to reduce major local complications as compared to manual compression, all sealing devices have documented a significant reduction in time to hemostasis.	1.1571451283680072
The increased patient comfort is essentially related to the ability of sheath removal immediately after PTCA.	0.9384882299119024
Vascular closure devices reduce the burden of medical staff and decrease hospital costs by earlier discharge.	0.8787712429960285
Amniotic fluid is a major factor of the intrauterine environment, and deviation from the normal volume is associated with an increased perinatal morbidity and mortality.	1.079930140990016
Polyhydramnios occurs in 0.2 to 1.6 % of pregnancies.	1.139545330320001
It may be due to a number of congenital anomalies, an abnormal karyotype, maternal diabetes, Rh-disease or intrauterine infections potentially requiring non-invasive or invasive measures.	0.9798568151095384
However, the most common indication for prenatal intervention due to polyhydramnios is the Twin-Twin-Transfusion Syndrom (TTTS).	1.1021821402005072
Treatment of polyhydramnios may focus on correction of the causative lesion, or symptomatic relief through drainage of amniotic fluid.	0.9930200989086587
Maternal administration of cyclooxygenase inhibitors represents a further, non-invasive therapeutic option.	0.8747270400375136
Indomethacin, Sulindac, or Nimesulide reduce the fetal urine output thus decreasing amniotic fluid volume over time without the risks associated with invasive procedures.	0.9477762602455286
However, potentially serious ductal constriction as well as a delay in the onset of amniotic fluid reduction have limited its application.	1.2662774902725207
Percutaneous amniotic fluid drainage may provide immediate reduction of intrauterine pressure, but is associated with a complication rate of 1 to 1.5 %.	1.2011457268238803
The hemodynamic characteristics of monochorionic pregnancies complicated by TTTS have led to the development of endoscopic laser coagulation of placental vascular anastomoses as a definitive treatment.	0.8037774437633904
Treatment is only required in a small minoritiy of pregnancies with polyhydramnios.	1.0112688058482255
Mild cases can be managed expectatively.	0.8272698243518454
Intrauterine pressure increases with an excessive increase in amniotic fluid volume (AFI > 400 mm or MVP > 150 mm) leads to the elevation of intrauterine pressure.	0.9793561853705829
Complications such as preterm premature rupture of membranes and preterm labor may lead to premature delivery.	0.7256559583914752
The main goal of prenatal treatment of polyhydramnios is thus the improvement of fetal outcome through prolongation of gestation and/or the alleviation of maternal symptoms.	1.0154351317589456
With the recent developments in computer technology and the improvements in modern neuroimaging, frame-based stereotactic guidance for open microsurgical procedures has been increasingly replaced by neuronavigation, also called frameless stereotaxy.	0.9737516389379561
It allows transfer of individual patient's images onto the operative field to assist the neurosurgeon intraoperatively in defining the tumor margins or identifying functionally important brain areas.	0.9207109186682384
The different localization techniques employed are articulated position-sensing arms, infrared or ultrasound systems working with the principle of satellite navigation and robotic systems integrated with the operating microscope.	0.9238387493638605
In 200 operations performed with different systems (arm-based, robotic and infrared) the method proved to be helpful, enabling fewer invasive procedures to be performed.	1.1458242014693658
With a mean deviation of 2.87 +/- 1.9 mm for intraoperative localization, the accuracy was only slightly worse than in frame-based stereotaxy with deviations below 2 mm.	1.2033806242611622
Neuronavigation was most helpful for operations on deeply seated lesions, skull-base tumors and lesions in brain areas with high functionality.	0.9278545890098711
The major disadvantage is the use of preoperative data for navigation, leading to inaccuracies when anatomical structures are altered during the operation by resection of tumors or shift of intracranial soft tissue.	1.0702710729970262
Intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might be a solution for this problem.	0.8370564959010401
With the method of intraoperative MRI developed in our department it has already been possible to update neuronavigation with images reflecting intraoperative changes in anatomy.	0.9821925405313631
Therefore, neuronavigation is definitely a method with growing importance in operative routine, and it will also spread into other surgical specialties.	1.213134760572453
Severe pain of mucositis induced by cytostatic conditioning therapy in bone marrow transplantation (BMT) patients generally requires continuous parenteral opioid treatment.	1.0123352453020618
Cognitive and psychological disturbances are frequent complications subsequent to BMT and may result from cerebral opioid side effects.	0.9640462784779773
The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficiency of continuous morphine in mucositis pain and the side-effects in BMT patients.	0.9230011592044833
Particular emphasis was placed on the question of whether reaction times, which are usually measured to estimate opioid effects upon vigilance, are influenced by pain-induced cognitive impairments in pain patients.	1.1890481551522267
Methods While in hospital, 10 BMT patients were examined daily with the aid of a mucositis scale, subjective visual analog scales (VAS) for pain and mood parameters, a German version of the McGill pain questionnaire (MPQ), and a mental performance task battery, and the morphine given was documented.	1.2392012987763967
Mental performance tests were simple auditory reaction time and choice reaction time.	0.7785433585113791
Seven patients also performed a Sternberg memory search test in which they had to use 'yes' and 'no' response keys to match visually presented test letters to a previously memorized set of letters.	0.9358273539759622
Practice and baseline data were collected within the first week before BMT.	1.0374049851711746
Results The intensity and duration of mucositis differed from patient to patient, resulting in different pain intensities and MPQ scores.	0.9335468028741106
Prolongation of the choice reaction time averaged over the period of mucositis treatment correlated significantly with residual pain intensity (Spearman rs = 0.88, p < 0.01) but not with morphine dose (rs = 0.35, p = 0.33).	0.9782822439671499
For the Sternberg memory search test greater correlation coefficients resulted between reaction time and morphine dose (rs = 0.86, p = 0.014) than between reaction time and residual pain intensity (rs = 0.61, p = 0.15).	0.8709139856976517
In turn, pain intensity, unlike morphine dose, was significantly correlated with high scores in the mood parameters for depression, passivity, and tiredness.	1.1385718069217283
Conclusions It is concluded that both pain and morphine can impair cognitive performance, but that these mental stressors seem to differ according to qualitative criteria.	1.0031119795986734
Whereas pain might slow reaction time by distracting a patient's attention, particularly in low mental demand tasks, morphine could interfere with more specific cognitive processes, such as short-term memory operations, that are required in more complex tasks.	1.1623515806385782
The case of a 63-year-old man with a widespread retroperitoneal tumor and two tumor nodules in the left testis is described.	1.0924171741745825
Histopathological and cytopathological examination of tissue from the retroperitoneal tumor led to a diagnosis of lymphoreticular neoplasia.	0.9143443875260058
The patient died in acute cardiac failure, five weeks after initial presentation.	1.2006505203279434
Autopsy revealed another tumor nodule in the right atrium.	0.8024697280841917
Macroscopically, the bone marrow appeared normal.	1.1251799671158897
The tumor cells were reactive for CD45, vimentin and chloroacetate esterase, but were unreactive with a broad spectrum of antibodies against myelomonocytic and lymphocytic antigens and antibodies against tryptase and c-kit (CD117), characteristic markers for mast cells.	1.0938283146805095
However, the bone marrow exhibited the typical picture of mastocytosis.	1.1676988196135254
A diagnosis of bone marrow mastocytosis with an associated secondary extramedullary mast cell sarcoma was established.	0.9526110333101092
The cause of death was heart failure due to arrhythmia caused by an exophytic atrioseptal tumor nodule.	0.8685906519875888
Thrombembolic events as paraneoplastic complications in malignant disease account for severe morbidity and mortality in these patients.	0.9980885739369891
In some cases disturbance in hemostasis is the first manifestation of a neoplastic process.	1.014948128554044
We report the cases of two patients with cerebral and extracerebral vessel occlusions, in whom epithelial tumors of low malignant potential (borderline-tumors) of ovar and peritoneum were diagnosed later on.	1.2874636395720251
In one case the removal of the tumor stopped the coagulation problems.	1.1377263456677797
The second patient died a few days after the first symptoms with devastating multiple vessel occlusion.	1.055629685585809
In stroke of unknown aetiology a paraneoplastic process should be kept in mind.	0.8249610699817777
The diagnosis is more probable with recurrent thrombembolism in different body regions and when warfarin therapie was ineffective.	0.9344465839312474
Thoughtful coagulation studies and a tumor search program is recommended in these cases.	1.0179487567857697
Brain-stem gliomas occur mainly in childhood and are localized in the mesencephalon, pons and medulla oblongata.	0.9467414289972924
Diagnosis is a domain of MRI, requiring T2, T1 and KM.	0.9412569729395573
CT shows hemorrhage and calcification well.	0.6124014178905107
The criteria are the primary site, size, tumor growth, brain-stem enlargement, delineation, intralesional structure, exophytic components and enhancement.	1.0144477995892276
Secondary criteria are herniation, hydrocephalus and liquorgenic seeding.	0.7863934816424089
In CT glioma are hypodense, in MRI hyperintense in T2 and hypointense in T1.	0.8996049517592888
Enhancement is seen in 25-60% and does not allow differentiation of tumor vs nontumor or gradings.	1.0891022995592132
Factors influencing poor outcome are high grade, a short history, cranial nerve involvement, severe brain-stem enlargement, pontine site, diffuse growth and recurrency.	1.082963907650299
The 5-year-survival rate is 30% (after radiation: focal tumors 85%, diffuse 20%).	1.3348057361138264
Most frequent are symptoms of brain pressure, cerebellum, cranial nerves and pyramidal tract.	0.9100068049062797
There is no agreement on whether biopsy is necessary or not.	0.8032706237199814
A diagnosis of tumor is highly suggestive if classical MRI findings fit the clinical history.	0.9756463204325783
Radiobiological and physical examinations suggest clinical advantages of heavy ion irradiation.	0.7919802390170879
We report the result of 23 women and 22 men (median age 48 years) with skull base tumors irradiated with carbon ion beams at the Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Schwerionenforschung (GSI), Darmstadt, from December 1997 until September 1999.	1.2167820294606269
The study included patients with chordomas (17), chondrosarcomas (10) and other skull base tumors (Table 1).	1.2902964887615593
It is the first time that the intensity-controlled rasterscan-technique and the application of positron-emission tomography (PET) for quality assurance was used.	1.1509458107010546
All patients had computed tomography for three-dimensional-treatment planning (Figure 1).	1.1146950278393468
Patients with chordomas and chondrosarcomas underwent fractionated carbon ion irradiation in 20 consecutive days (median total dose 60 GyE).	0.8598937044559999
Other histologies were treated with carbon ion boost of 15 to 18 GyE delivered to the macroscopeic tumor after fractionated stereotatic radiotherapy (median total dose 63 GyE).	0.8979527136615256
Mean follow-up was 9 months.	1.0893467908409364
Irradiation was well tolerated by all patients.	0.687953855398252
Partial tumor remission was seen in 7 patients (15,5%) (Figure 2).	1.2911703161243386
One-year local control rate was 94%.	0.9502329996528968
One patient (2,2%) deceased.	1.2599038440866226
No severe toxicity and no local recurrence within the treated volume were observed.	0.812935715894554
Clinical effectiveness and technical feasibility of this modality could clearly be demonstrated in our study.	0.9755711451237086
To evaluate the clinical relevance of the different beam modalities studies with larger patient numbers are necessary.	0.9949938139384366
To continue our project a new heavy ion acclerator exclusively for clinical use is planed to be constructed in Heidelberg.	0.8491522650119832
Indirect trauma to the shoulder and knee joint often results in injuries to the ligaments and the capsule, and more rarely in fractures.	1.00458127148126
Anterior shoulder dislocation is common.	0.6668379922256706
Over the last few years arthroscopic repair of the torn labrum has become established as the therapy of choice.	1.0587685666579578
Isolated ruptures of the collateral ligaments of the knee can be treated functionally.	1.1308991227886114
A torn anterior cruciate ligament of the knee joint can be compensated by the quadriceps muscle if this is adequately prepared by special exercises.	1.0032233155757575
Chronic or combined instabilities should be treated surgically by ACI grafting techniques.	0.9713302388498033
Menisceal injuries are treated arthroscopically.	0.7027459824878673
Objective: Comparison of low back pain (LBP) patients with and without fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) with regard to affective distress.	1.0034233145381475
Methods: Patients with LBP who had been admitted to various clinics in Germany were examined upon admission.	1.1451779224764098
Comparisons were done by dividing the patients into groups with and without signs of FMS.	0.8198757802705201
Additionally, both groups were compared after being matched according to sex, age, and pain severity.	1.3150222124449176
Results: 15 out of 135 LBP patients met the American College of Rheumatology criteria for fibromyalgia.	0.9708825961507287
Patients with FMS showed remarkably higher levels of pain severity and affective distress.	0.783719611975455
After controlling for different levels of pain severity, these pronounced differences disappeared.	0.9723492371853354
Conclusion: Affective distress is not a unique feature of FMS, but seem to be caused entirely by higher levels of pain severity.	1.272618341452757
Methods: Cases of invasive HI-infections were reported in a national active surveillance program.	1.1170575189321141
The case definition required the typical clinical picture and a HI positive culture from a physiologically sterile site (or throat swab or tracheal aspirate in case of epiglottitis or pneumonia) in children up to 10 years.	1.112900214240376
All initial reports were validated with a questionnaire that additionally questioned the vaccination status, type of vaccine, therapy, outcome of the disease and characteristics of the bacteria.	1.1905564662376378
The relation between the type of Hib vaccine used on the risk of infection was analysed in a case control study with controls selected at random from a population based sampling frame.	1.0925879468164204
Results: 310 confirmed cases of invasive HI infections were reported during the observation period, 199 of these with meningitis, 56 with epiglottitis.	0.9629845595758678
The number of cases declined from 71 in the last six months of 1992, 120 in 1993, and 65 in 1994 to 54 cases in 1995.	1.1458650771517964
In 1995 the incidence in up to 5 year old children was 1.1/100 000 for all infection sites and 0.7/100 000 for meningitis.	1.2201195369343054
The reduced rates were mainly due to a decrease in the number of unvaccinated cases, whereas the number of cases in vaccinated children fluctuated between 22 and 36 per year.	1.0497703588216145
Most of these were observed in incompletely vaccinated children, who according to the German recommendations could already have received at least one further vaccination at the time of the infection.	1.2628485732825574
The type of vaccine (HbOC, PRP-D or OMP) was not significantly associated with the risk of infection in vaccinated children.	1.139911924167708
10 % of the bacteria produced betalactamase.	1.2109117181220446
In accordance with the German recommendations third generation cephalosporines were used in almost all cases of meningitis.	1.0715102891767418
One third of these, however, received additional antibiotics.	1.213515903863656
Conclusions: The present incidence of systemic HI infections in Germany is low.	1.223496867601408
A further decrease, however, would be possible with "on time" completion of the vaccination schedule according to the German recommendations in all children.	1.2058947475212822
For more than a century peritoneal adhesions are being recognized as frequent sequelae following abdominal surgery.	0.8304995396417284
Intraoperative lesions of the mesothelial lining by abrasion, ischemia, dissication, and foreign bodies result in complaints, intestinal obstruction, female infertility, and problems during reoperations.	0.9863116533498979
The global increase of life expectancy and surgical procedures are leading to rising incidences of adhesion-related complications and subsequent socio-economic implications.	1.015912224109119
As of today, there is no safe and efficient prophylaxis available.	1.0050056465084993
Scientific efforts should be aimed at a liquid substance for single intraperitoneal application which significantly reduces postoperative adhesions at reasonable cost without adverse effects on blood coagulation and wound healing.	0.8296480539645062
Even today the name of F. D. von Recklinghausen is often mentioned in connection with primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism.	0.7981739910875413
He was one of the first physicians and scientists to render outstanding services to the classification of structural changes of bones, and in many aspects his work remains valid today.	1.223313748646193
He succeeded through precise and comparative studies in making the disease and symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism known and thus distinguishing it from other known structural bone diseases.	1.0510543923126758
He also described the phenomenon of "bone remodeling" which has become relevant today again.	1.0753794597837862
Although his written macroscopic and microscopic observations include meticulously precise differentiations which make it difficult to study them today, they are still of interest in order to follow his basic ideas.	0.9881364967932303
This article does not constitute a comprehensive biography, but it contains a description of F. D. von Recklinghausen's important work on bone pathology against the background of the main stages of his life.	0.9981899984684848
Soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) of the extremities are characterized by a high rate of local recurrences.	1.1459160725560593
Limb salvage approaches using multimodality therapy protocols have replaced amputation.	0.6558954169688137
In order to evaluate isolated hyperthermic limb perfusion (ILP) in a multimodality therapy concept, we reviewed our patients treated using this method.	1.262250193295617
Between January 1982 and December 1995, 25 ILPs, using cisplatin, melphalan and adriamycin, were performed in 22 patients with STS.	1.1217324490727099
Forty percent were treated for local recurrences; histology was dominated by malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) and synovial sarcoma.	0.9721619013610107
In all, 68 % of the STS were classified as UICC stage IIb or IIIa/b.	0.9229015523174067
Most of the cases (14) underwent wide or radical resection, 4 patients received intraoperative radiotherapy, and 5 were treated with external beam radiation.	1.34627726480714
Complications were recorded in 32 % of the cases.	0.9579098300889396
With a median follow-up of 45 months (range 1-143), the 5-year overall survival rate was 81 %.	1.2338824951045742
The median recurrence-free time was 19 months and the 5-year disease-free survival rate 34 %.	1.091565978037126
There were 13 local failures, and distant metastases developed in 36 % of the patients.	1.0248649042436
Concerning high-grade sarcomas (UICC stage IIb, IIIa/b), we found local recurrences in 75 % of all cases.	1.3213155852158522
Five of 11 patients with local failures underwent perfusion after they refused amputation, and 7 incompletely resected STS received ILP without reoperation.	0.9936216455221097
All of these demonstrated local recurrence.	0.7697609668402523
This rate of local recurrence proved to be different from patients with tumor-free resection margins (p = 0.0001, log-rank test).	0.9761549461601812
The amputation rate after isolated limb perfusion was 27 % (mean 11 months after treatment).	1.2180032480212597
Long-term results of ILP showed a considerable local recurrence rate and a low disease-free survival.	1.198451293659791
Perfusion in patients without tumor-free resection margins does not prevent local recurrence.	1.0112668661732287
We conclude that ILP with cisplatin, melphalan and adriamycin should be considered carefully and is not an additional treatment strategy of first choice.	1.1816262627685763
Infections with the grampositive bacterium Clostridium difficile occurs mostly in worst ill, multimorbide patients treated with cytostatica or antibiotics.	0.7608299347690406
We report about two healthy children with pseudomembranous colitis caused by Clostridium difficile without an underlying illness or a former history of antibiotic treatment.	0.9185280814882785
Huntington's disease (HD) may cause considerable diagnostic problems because of the highly variable clinical features, especially at the beginning of the illness.	1.0845127604025206
We report the case of a 21-year-old woman with definite HD whose main symptoms were psychopathological changes that were misinterpreted as schizophrenia for 7 years.	0.8926808063833536
One reason for this misdiagnosis was the unusual, very early onset and the remarkable earlier age of onset of HD compared with that of other affected relatives.	1.0307815188225897
The phenomenon of earlier onset within one affected family is well documented in the literature in cases with the paternally transmitted mutated gene.	1.0287377782962508
Diagnostic landmarks were consideration of the initially mild disturbances of movement and the once again repeated detailed examination of the family history.	1.0323256712084332
ICD-10 is to be implemented for morbidity coding in Germany soon.	0.908477612827071
The electronic versions of ICD-10 are introduced.	0.42513341341485733
For everyday work with the classification and for epidemiological research further tools are provided by DIMDI: ICD-10 meta files, ICD conversion tables, ICD-10 thesaurus of diagnostic terms.	0.47326761423494534
All files are available free of charge via the INTERNET.	0.36041979684062686
Because of poorly compartmentalized paraclavicular soft tissues, total extraperiostal claviculectomy in cases of malignoma with cortical destruction is always marginal.	0.7931868164337609
Due to different muscular compensation in the patients examined, literature disagrees on the biomechanical consequences of claviculectomy for the shoulder girdle.	0.9722823468500353
Thrombolytic therapy of pulmonary embolism with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) has proved to be an established method; but intra- and postoperatively, there is a high risk of bleeding complications.	1.2678394837366371
A 50-year old female with familiar hypophosphatasia and suspected deep venous thrombosis was undergoing osteosynthesis of a femoral fracture.	0.9102437796603563
Intraoperatively, petCO2 suddenly dropped, paCO2 rose, and circulatory arrest occurred.	0.8772834041836586
CPR was started immediately with closed-chest cardiac compression and intravenous application of catecholamines.	0.8976394796932105
While continuing CPR, surgery was stopped, the wound was sealed provisionally, and the patient was transferred to the ICU.	1.199601171248776
Because of suspected massive pulmonary embolism, thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA in a total dosage of 100 mg was begun.	0.9162700099676102
2.25 hours after the onset of circultory arrest, and 1.5 hours after the beginning of thrombolysis, the patient's hemodynamic patterns under high-dosage catecholamines were satisfactory.	1.1855632229852469
The bleeding after thrombolysis and coagulopathy required massive blood transfusions.	0.6807036128724355
The situation was also complicated by lesions of the liver, spleen and small intestines, which required surgical intervention, and acute renal failure, which had to be treated with transient hemofiltration.	1.2345788079122189
Twenty-eight days after receiving CPR, the patient was discharged from the ICU.	1.1437272318016343
A diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was established by clinical signs, capnometry, blood gas analysis, and electrocardiography.	1.1575039185848224
Due to the requirements of the emergency situation (ongoing CPR), further diagnostic tools were not used.	1.2980064377301486
The patient survived without any neurological deficiency, despite the extended 135-min use of CPR, and despite massive bleeding due to surgical trauma, and to performing CPR in the presence of fibrinolytica.	1.0882492832123636
With the increasing use of cross-sectional echocardiography in patients with overt or suspected pulmonary thromboembolism in the emergency rooms, more and more right atrial thrombi are detected.	1.075824141421729
These are so-called "transitthrombi" from the venous system on their way to the pulmonary arteries and they are a severe presentation of thromboembolic disease.	1.1068363563476913
They appear as an imminent pulmonary embolism and usually coexists with an already massive embolism.	0.8854725105993657
In patients were a right atrial thrombus is associated with a patent foramen ovale, paradoxical arterial embolism has been observed.	0.9576768389273049
Right sided heart thrombi have a high mortality rate and need immediate treatment.	0.9995758366526136
In our hospital we have seen 14 patients with right atrial thrombi and pulmonary embolism in a period of 6 years.	1.2121632420907718
Three patients had cardiac arrest with a massive pulmonary embolism, seven patients presented with a submassive embolism.	1.0195087125717408
All patients were treated immediately after echocardiographic diagnosis without pulmonary angiography.	1.0386351274413401
In about half of the cases transesophageal echocardiography was done additionally for diagnosis and monitoring.	1.1066436949580898
Therapeutic options were thrombectomy, fibrinolysis or anticoagulants.	0.702997328765987
We treated one of our patients with thrombectomy, eleven patients with fibrinolysis and two patients with anticoagulants.	1.117813296353131
The era of modern anaesthesia in Germany began on January 24th, 1847.	0.9113926374653686
This day, professor in ordinary Johann Ferdinand Heyfelder anaesthetized a patient with sulphuric ether in the clinic of surgery and ophthalmology of the University of Erlangen.	1.0095144426070424
By March 17th, 1847, Heyfelder had performed 121 surgical procedures under ether.	0.7550765455188211
The operations in majority were teeth-extractions, and a few more complex operations such as the treatment of a harelip or of lip cancer or the resection of the shoulder joint.	1.1925287646938771
Heyfelder described in detail 108 of these inhalations in a little book entitled The experiments with sulphuric ether.	0.8440185639323139
This monograph published in March, 1847, represents one of the first complete dissertations on sulphuric ether in the German literature.	1.0065245629794455
In a special chapter he analyzed the development of various physiological and psychological parameters during etherization.	0.9604278075968987
Heyfelder also examined blood and urine of some etherized patients and reported that he did not find any important or specific alterations.	0.9200887371967162
In 1847, Heyfelder was probably the first to apply salt-ether in man.	1.0110153723728548
After 4 administrations he concluded that salt ether acted more quickly but shorter than sulphuric ether.	0.763546648128643
Advantageous were its application without problems and ease of induction.	0.7418635234877455
Disadvantageous were its high volatility, its price and the difficulty of getting it in a pure form.	0.9951107772846355
From December, 1847, on Heyfelder started to use chloroform.	0.9321918582346065
He was now able to perform more major operations, for example the total resection of the hip-joint.	1.108777869882964
In his book The experiments with sulphuric ether, salt ether, and chloroform he describes a great number of anaesthetic administrations using these 3 agents.	0.8704902148717958
In his summary Heyfelder concluded, that chloroform was undoubtly superior to sulphuric ether mainly because it was a quicker acting and longer lasting agent and leads to deeper narcosis.	0.9252107581837105
Moreover its application was much easier for it needed no special apparatus.	0.7925477144181355
However, because of its great anaesthetic potency, Heyfelder particularly demanded great caution in the application of chloroform.	1.209093881910876
Explicitely he expected an assistant for chloroformizations, whose only duty was to supervise the inhalations and the patient - a forerunner of the modern specialized anaesthesiologist.	1.1360875944243485
Background: To evaluate the publication rate of abstracts presented during the German Anaesthesia Congress (DAK) in MEDLINE-listed journals in comparison to the publication rate of abstracts presented during the meeting of the European Society of Anaesthesiologists (ESA).	1.0646954030900522
The uniform development of the human embryo, as described by classic human embryology, has been confirmed by sonoembryological studies.	1.2112472610259453
In particular, the embryonic brain is suitable for transvaginal ultrasound examination, because the large "cystic" cavities of the brain can easily be imaged.	1.1291988152412364
Sonoembryology not only describes normal embryonic anatomy and normal relations and proportions of organs, but also the development of structural abnormalities.	1.1164537138510187
Approximately one-third of all congenital anomalies, originate from the central nervous system (CNS).	0.6869604710547353
Based on normal sonoembryology and on recent experiences with early CNS anomalies, we recognize some sonographic signs of an early CNS anomaly: (1) Apparent dysmorphology of the brain or the head; (2) Altered appearance of the cerebral ventricles with disproportion of the brain compartments, where the amount of fluid is either greater or less than normal; (3) In the early fetal period, choroid plexuses that are too small to fill the ventricle from the medial to the lateral wall; (4) Irregular contour of the spine/back; (5) Extra-CNS anomalies.	1.1676477845744613
In the following survey, normal sonoembryology of the CNS is described, and CNS anomalies of the early pregnancy are discussed.	1.164072493711088
Telomerase is an enzyme that elongates telomeric repeats, the specialized structures at the ends of chromosomes that provide genomic stability and compensate for the physiologic process of telomere shortening.	0.860273226603884
It has been implicated in cellular senescence, immortalization, and carcinogenesis.	1.0163355090280324
Over 85% of human tumours, and 95% of non-melanocytic skin cancers, show telomerase activity, in contrast to the corresponding normal tissues.	1.3238957341658166
This suggests that telomerase activity may play an important role in carcinogenesis.	0.8167798678718375
Recent evidence shows that telomerase is active not only in embryonal and germ line tissues, but also in some normal tissues.	1.0714707594710449
In the skin, this activity has been traced to the stem-cell-bearing epidermal basal cell layer, possibly reflecting the presence of telomerase-competent stem cells.	1.052952077459129
These findings require a reconsideration of our interpretation of telomerase activity in tumours of the skin and other tissues.	1.001989433271833
As a causal relationship linking telomerase activity and cancer has yet not been demonstrated, some caution is warranted.	0.9272981679275244
The established criteria of auditory brainstem responses (ABR) such as JV latency, JI-V interpeak latency and interaural differences of  latency or amplitude have been found to be sensitive for detecting tumors of the cerebellopontine angle if a response is present.	0.9572312277332742
However, the ABR can be absent in cases of acoustic neuromas because of desynchronization, even though pure-one audiometry indicates that responses should be present.	1.0861197726994603
This retrospective study compared the ABR and pure-tone thresholds in 234 cases with cerebellopontine angle tumors and a control group of 181 cases with sensory hearing losses in order to quantify threshold discrepancies.	1.0306975887609395
The average deficit of the objective ABR threshold (DOABRT) to the subjective pure-tone threshold for those frequencies between 1-6 kHz was 3.6 dB for the control group (ABR and pure tone thresholds very close) and 31.2 dB for the tumor group (ABR threshold much higher than the pure-tone threshold).	1.2109527968982503
ABR thresholds 30 dB higher than the high-frequency pure tone thresholds were found in 40.6% of the tumor group and in none of the control group.	1.3344731028127004
Thus, deficits of the ABR threshold >30 dB can be considered to be an additional criterion for detecting retrocochlear disease and increases ABR sensitivity for tumor detection even if responses are absent.	1.2103557248375387
The association of nevus flammeus with mongolian spot, nevus fuscoceruleus, nevus spilus and, with variable frequency, with nevus anemicus has been termed phacomatosis pigmentovascularis, a genodermatosis first described by Ota and co-workers.	1.0855250104410261
Four different combinations have been specified.	0.5845113949868684
Most cases are reported from the Japanese literature.	0.9882939252927954
Phacomatosis pigmentovascularis may constitute an exclusively cutaneous disorder, but overlapping with other syndromes like Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome or Sturge-Weber syndrome is also possible.	0.9260319025089672
We report a 30-year-old woman with nevus flammeus on the back and right arm associated with nevus fuscoceruleus on the back.	1.1695809824140206
ORIF management of unstable trochanteric fractures of type A3 of the A0 classification is difficult because of lateral dislocation of the proximal fractured segments, particularly when only the sliding hip-screw is used for fixation.	1.09486142664661
A connectable butt-press plate was recently developed in order to prevent this type of dislocation.	0.9798904720662972
We review the results with this fixation technique in 22 elderly patients with an average age of 76 years who presented with highly unstable trochanteric fracture of the A3 type.	1.1486276341079118
Three patients died of diseases unrelated to the trauma or operation before the fractures had healed.	0.9826158870839246
The other 19 were followed prospectively until fracture healing had occurred.	0.7901547708485657
Complaints, leg shortening and changes in the CCD angle were recorded.	0.8134678570038341
Furthermore, the mobility score was determined.	1.0356478208863065
Although the patients were able to bear full weight after the operation, no lateral dislocation of fragments was observed.	1.0044957685661862
Only 1 patient had a varus dislocation of 5  Â° until the fracture had consolidated.	1.0457214026207697
This was due to severe osteopenia and subsequent dislocation of the screw within the femoral head.	0.8734518640341956
No pseudarthrosis, osteitis or rotational malalignment was noted.	0.7936167379447651
Five of the surviving patients had a lower mobility score after fracture healing as compared to the status before the fracture was sustained.	1.0635813380643675
On the basis of this review, we recommend the use of this new connectable buttress plate with sliding hip screws because it provides sifficient fixation of highly unstable fractures of type A3.	1.2171088507767973
Superficial leptomeningeal hemosiderosis is a rare disease of the central nervous system.	0.9207394954366162
Chronic bleeding into the subarachnoid space causes deposition of hemosiderin in glial cells and subsequent damage to adjacent brain tissue.	0.7702679171318175
There is a characteristic predilection for the cerebellum and eighth cranial nerve.	0.8902977341735373
Accordingly, among a variety of symptoms, cerebellar ataxia and sensorineural hearing loss progressing to total deafness commonly occur.	1.0078983193222426
To date, the hearing loss has been believed to be purely neural.	0.9160198727475378
We present a case of superficial hemosiderosis in a patient with total deafness who was successfully provided with a cochlear implant.	1.027320535499072
Audiometry demonstrated total bilateral cochlear hearing losses but with preserved function of the eighth cranial nerve.	0.7902226327759632
These findings make us conclude that in contrast to current opinion, superficial hemosiderosis can initially damage the cochlea alone.	1.023256301340348
Thus, patients with total deafness due to this disorder may benefit from cochlear implantation.	1.1793989486213778
All patients require careful audiometric assessment, including promontory stimulation.	0.925814783564336
Intracardiac masses remain a challenge for imaging diagnosis.	0.7417992339772644
Although most lesions are initially detected by echocardiography, additional imaging studies, i.e., magnetic resonance imaging and electron beam computed tomography, are commonly requested.	1.092555782580143
Features and limitations of these two imaging techniques are illustrated and briefly analyzed.	0.9817664845396674
For the first time, the present study assessed the achievable predictive value of early self-experienced neuropsychological deficits for the fater development of schizophrenia.	1.0415641305073626
Ninety-six patients with DSM-III-R diagnoses mainly of the formerly neurotic or personality disordered field, of whom 81 % had shown such basic disorders at the time of the index examination and therefore were classified as persons at high risk of developing schizophrenia, were re-examined for schizophrenia.	1.1905023006520161
After an average follow-up period of about 8 years, more than half of the re-examined sample had developed a schizophrenic disorder according to DSM-III-R.	1.0146617655938213
The outcome of schizophrenia versus no schizophrenia was predicted correctly in 77 % of cases by the presence or absence of self-experienced disturbances of perception, thought, speech or action.	1.0903165469420208
To date, at least 12 types of primary dystonia can be distinguished on a genetic basis.	1.190603450810243
A 3-bp deletion in the DYT1 gene causes early onset, generalized torsion dystonia (TD), and mutations in the GTP cyclohydrolase I and the tyrosine hydroxylase genes result in dopa-responsive dystonia (DYT5).	0.9243005711287253
A missense change in the D2 dopamine receptor in one large family (DYT11) has recently been implicated in myoclonus-dystonia.	0.9410715019644483
Furthermore, seven other loci for dystonia genes have been mapped to chromosomal regions, including a locus for a mixed dystonia phenotype (DYT6), one form of focal dystonia (DYT7), three types of paroxysmal dystonia (DYT8-10), X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (DYT3), and rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (DYT12).	1.2222670421654096
No positive linkage results have yet been obtained for autosomal recessive TD (DYT2) and several other families of different types of dominantly inherited TD (DYT4).	0.9231132025937105
In addition, hereditary secondary dystonia may occur as part of familial diseases of the basal ganglia, metabolic and storage disorders, and various X-linked and other familial neurodegenerative syndromes affecting the basal ganglia.	1.1075617840031704
It may be anticipated that the traditional clinical and etiological classifications of dystonia will increasingly be replaced by a genetic one and that the identification of more dystonia genes may lead to a better understanding of these largely nondegenerative disorders.	0.9831848908335671
In this study we investigated whether, in conjunction with neuroleptics, a psychoeducational and cognitively oriented treatment for schizophrenic outpatients and their key-persons can improve the course of schizophrenic illness within a 2-year follow-up.	1.1664077266835746
This prospective randomized study covered a total of 191 schizophrenic patients (according to DSM-III-R) and comprised a psychoeducational training and cognitive psychotherapy for patients and counseling for their key persons in various combinations.	1.0370537237805786
Patients were examined before, immediately after and 2 years after the end of the intervention.	1.0797765221406148
Patients in the treatment groups reduced their overall psychopathology and their attention deficit.	1.1643382984537067
For patients receiving all three treatment conditions, there was a relevant preventive effect with regard to the rehospitalization rate appearing during the second year of the follow-up.	1.0364048410529185
We conclude that in the mid-term, a combination of psychoeducational and cognitively oriented therapy for patients and their keypersons can improve the course of schizophrenic illness.	1.1897888928706635
Background: Cigarette smoking is common during pregnancy and can expose the developing fetus to transplacental carcinogens, but relatively little information is available on fetal uptake of such compounds.	1.084387398400963
It was the aim of the present study to analyze the first urine of newborns of mothers who did or did not smoke for metabolites of the tobacco-specific carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) as well as nicotine and cotinine.	1.2478673154921167
Recently there has been an increase in the prevalent HIV infected population in Germany because of declines in progression to AIDS and death while the number of newly infected patients remains constant.This increases the potential value of both current and new approaches to disease prevention.	1.0213778196783005
Post exposure prophylaxis (PEP), defined as treatment of a person who has been exposed to an HIV infected person by a route through which transmission is possible, is one possible way to decrease the number of new cases.	1.15864960143938
Economic evaluation can help to answer the question whether PEP should be provided to different exposed populations or whether the resources that would be used for PEP should be used for other HIV prevention or treatment interventions.The value of PEP depends both on the costs and effectiveness of the intervention.	1.037958522236291
In this paper, we use examples from the literature to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of PEP in different population subgroups, including those occupationally exposed, those exposed through unprotected sex, and those exposed through IV drug use.	1.1981629278573138
The cost-effectiveness of PEP is also compared to literature estimates of the cost-effectiveness of other prevention activities.	0.9869324836380734
The aim of this study was to access the importance of the laparoscopic colorectal resection.	0.9768236712970088
Of 131 patients 80 were operated on laparoscopically.	0.6988144016632208
The conversion rate was 14 % (13/93).	1.173236641907033
A total of 47 patients suffered from cancer.	0.86775503318658
Curative resection was performed in 41 patients (87 %).	0.9343279248291596
For comparison, 48 patients who underwent open resection were used.	0.9964723383866798
The complication rate was lower after laparoscopy and no reoperation was performed.	0.8395897072363869
Patients recovered quicker and their first oral food intake and bowel movement were earlier.	0.8028152909942329
Hospital stay was shorter (15.3 vs. 8.1 days), and pain at rest and in motion was significantly reduced.	1.2335298706976598
Equal numbers of mesenteric lymph nodes were retrieved; adequate margins of resection could be obtained and the length of resected bowel did not differ.	0.9858919846197067
No port metastases were observed.	0.5664177220504136
Reduced morbidity, reduced hospital stay, reduced abdominal pain, quicker reconvalescence, and reduced overall health care costs are strong arguments in favor of laparoscopic colectomy.	1.1136167104906096
In the field of traumatology, compartment syndromes of the lower extremity are often seen after fractures and direct injuries, or after ischaemia.	1.142607176642157
Other causes include over-exertion and non-traumatic causes such as acute rhabdomyolysis, drug-induced myositis and eosinophilic myositis.	0.8857952892206464
This paper describes the clinical and MR course of a compartment syndrome following an ankle sprain.	0.9732396957526334
Each patient has the right of a dedicated pain therapy according to the state of the art.	1.0443231399507298
However an efficient pain therapy is not possible without knowing the cause of pain.	1.0602523209066428
In most posttraumatic pain situations peripheral nociceptors are activated and normal afferences are conducted via an intact nociceptive system.	0.803489584102288
In contrast, neuropathic pain pain is caused by lesions of the nervous system itself.	0.8993242193129249
Mechanisms of central sensibilization and involvement of the sympathetic nervous system may lead to chronification of such pain conditions.	0.7701043122518263
The therapeutic regime of nociceptive and neuropathic pain is demonstrated by algorithms of treatment modalities.	0.8920004853990849
Apart from classic non-opioid analgesics, co-analgesics and opioids have an important status in chronic pain management as well.	0.9516988711814822
Prescription of these substances has to follow strictly defined standards of pain therapy.	0.82793981004872
Blockades with local anaesthetics as mono-therapy of chronic pain are obsolete.	0.9692035496059278
In posttraumatic pain, however, a certain number of adjuvant blockades or infiltrations of triggerpoints may be helpful.	1.0232114058402093
The exeptional place of sympathetic blockades are in diagnosis and therapy of sympathetic maintained pain (SMP).	0.7363395149586197
Effects of 94 different psychosocial and psychotherapeutic interventions on well-being in the elderly were meta-analyzed.	1.0174597923941986
Psychological well-being was improved and self-rated depression decreased for about half a standard deviation.	1.006649073122487
The mean effect size for other-rated depression reached d=1.15.	0.7162581558914926
Whereas age of participants did not correlate with change in self-rated well-being or depression, other-rated depression improved less in older samples.	1.035271566427787
High effect sizes derived from control-enhancing interventions and behavior therapy.	0.7774619558467931
Sub-analyses showed that individual setting produced higher improvement than group setting.	0.7271318323577269
Higher "therapeutic" qualifications and interventions in nursing homes were associated with higher effect-sizes too.	0.827406227705793
Implications for planning inteventions in old age are discussed.	0.7656578053138062
The prognosis of laryngeal carcinoma worsens dramatically with the discovery of primary or secondary lymph node metastases.	0.9874084215253611
Thus consistent prophylaxis and therapy of metastases is indispensable.	0.9077174940952517
The standard therapy of manifest cervical lymph node metastases is surgery, if possible using the approach of conservative neck dissection.	1.143145625870927
In cases of a lymph node stage N3, i.e.	0.6714029468641224
fixated metastases with a diameter greater than 6 cm, individually adapted therapy in necessary because of the extremely poor prognosis.	0.9573861685690305
Objective: The German Ophthalmologic Society is rising to the challenges of the information age by offering comprehensive information resources online.	1.0173230031536116
Human recombinant interleukin 2 (IL-2), alone or in combination with other cytokines, is currently under investigation for the immunotherapy of metastatic tumours.	1.1533683297137534
Objective responses of 20%-35% have been reported in patients with disseminated melanoma and renal cell carcinoma who received high-dose intravenous IL-2 in combination with interferon- (IFN).	1.3323050321687344
However, treatment with IL-2 is complicated by a syndrome of life-threatening adverse reactions such as disseminated vascular leakage, fluid retention, severe hypotension, and (reversible) multiple organ dysfunction (MODS).	1.2144549600001118
A systemic inflammatory reaction (SIRS)/sepsis sepsis-like haemodynamic pattern has been described in patients after IL-2 bolus application alone.	1.1742503557790793
Our purpose was to study the haemodynamic changes in patients treated with high-dose IL-2 administered as a constant infusion and in combination with IFN.	1.0822229618787562
The histopathologic diagnosis of odontogenic cysts is based mainly on the morphological nature of the epithelial lining of cysts and their origin.	1.0630646302207094
We used the international histologic classification set up by the World Health Organisation in 1992.	0.8442232972682986
The aim of this study was to investigate the differentiation of various types of cyst using an immunohistochemical technique rather than by conventional morphological assessment.	0.9137901024829466
About five per cent of the children with congenital diaphragmatic hernia are asymptomatic during parturition and are diagnosed beyond the neonatal period.	0.9638728171573917
We report about particularities of "late-presenters" with congenital diaphragmatic hernias namely funnel chest and a fatal outcome of an associated acute gastric volvulus.	1.08372757040858
The retrospective results of carbon prostheses for knee ligament reconstruction in 120 patients, as established by questionnaire, are reported at 10  +/-  2 years follow-up.	1.2109714263803948
Eighty patients could also be reviewed clinically.	0.800110741482052
Some 60 % of the patients showed good subjective function at reduced activity level.	1.0534474347491796
Complications were seen in 72.5 % of the patients with rupture of the carbon prosthesis and in 68 % of those with synovitis.	1.2399142927290363
X-ray showed osteoarthritis in up to 59 % of the patients.	0.9494036193792544
Carbon prostheses for collateral ligament reconstruction (85 % medial, 5.8 % lateral) were successful in 75 % of cases.	1.253807012272857
Activity and time seem to be less responsible for failure of the carbon prostheses than the features of growing in.	1.0024933050334994
Destruction of the knee joint over time is due to reactive synovitis and catabolic enzyme reaction and correlates with joint effusion and pain.	0.8699987333645169
If these problems appear, (arthroscopic) resection of the synovia is indicated to interrupt the circulus vitiosus.	1.0040590741727944
Background: With resprect to very early screening it has become necessary to apply laboratory techniques more sensitive and more precise than the formerly used Guthrie-test to guarantee correct detection of hyperphenylalaninemias.	1.1172295499168683
Three quantitative methods were compared.	0.5702418594728115
The Viennese Medical School played an important role in the development of radiological examinations and signs of the temporal bone with conventional X-rays.	0.9265801181029237
Famous pioneers include E. G. Mayer (1893-1969) and L. Psenner (1910-1986).	0.9407519210964603
Nowadays conventional X-rays and tomography have lost their important role in diagnostic radiology of the temporal bone, but the basic principles established in those early years of radiology are still used now.	1.2391083368968994
This statement is correct not only for conventional X-rays, but particularly for "poly"-tomography in comparison with CT.	1.209405595050979
The success of interventional catheter based therapy of coronary artery disease is still limited by a high rate of chronic restenosis.	1.1194768502547892
Using alternative mechanical techniques, there is increasing evidence that restenosis can be prevented in certain subsets of patients by optimized balloon angioplasty, DCA and stenting as well as by the combined approach of primary tissue removal with adjunctive stent implantation.	1.06332359234044
This article summarizes the mechanical techniques of restenosis prevention or reduction that have been documented in controlled trials.	0.9149396530687417
Additional pharmacologic interventions and possibly genetic and/or radiotherapeutic approaches will be highly important for future reduction of restenosis.	0.8649270584652203
A safe closure of a dura lesion is necessary on account of the risk of potentially fatal (late) meningitis.	0.9147999389549142
161 duraplasties of the frontal skull base carried out from 1979 to 1994 at the ENT-department Fulda were evaluated in a retrospective study in regard to etiology, operative techniques and results.	1.10694007207606
Duraplasty of the rhinobasis was indicated in 70 cases of rhinobasal trauma, 47 cases after paranasal sinus surgery, 36 cases of tumors and 8 malformations.	1.0155318317496007
After an average follow-up time of 6 years the patients were interviewed for postoperative liquorrhea, sinusitis treated with antibiotics and meningitis.	1.2221538364445852
As an objective measure to verify the tight closure of the treated CSF-leaks a fluoreszein test was performed in 50,9 % 6 to 8 weeks after the operation.	1.1224173371027246
Duraplasty was successfull in more than 96 %.	0.8184808072737606
The approach and technique to perform a duraplasty have to be choosen individually considering size, location and etiology of the dural defect.	0.936672593641147
In the majority of dural defects in the area of the frontal skull base reconstruction can be carried out now a days via an endonasal approach.	0.9601308828991727
By use of allogenic tissue, a mucosal flap from the surrounding area to cover the graft and fibrin clue good results were obtained.	1.0375827438565675
The tophus is a characteristic and pathognomonic sign of chronic gout.	0.9390842040340485
Before effective drugs were available for the treatment of hyperuricaemia about 50 - 60% of patients with gout developed clinically and radiologically apparent urate crystal deposits.	1.0509799889085822
Clinical cutaneous manifestations of chronic gout are now rarely observed.	0.836324154117727
However, the presence of degenerative tissues, as in idiopathic osteoarthritis of the fingers, may predispose to the deposition of urate crystals.	1.2151094716710804
We report on a patient with secondary - probably diuretic-induced - hyperuricaemia and gout tophi in Heberden's nodes.	1.0617611680931296
HIV-1-associated encephalopathy (HIVE) remains an important manifestation of advanced HIV infection despite recent progress in antiretroviral therapy.	1.0446732047647596
This is in part due to particular pharmacological and virological characteristics of the central nervous system (CNS).	0.7141521182327271
HIVE is characterized by a "subcortical" dementia with psychomotor slowing as well as memory and concentration deficits.	0.888414992424298
An invariable finding are deficits of central motor function.	0.6874705170875183
Pathogenetically, an enhanced viral replication in immunocompetent CNS cells is believed to be a requirement.	1.098404275575833
This leads to neurotoxic effects directly elicited by viral products as well as indirectly by the immune response to virus infection.	0.9252938672623867
