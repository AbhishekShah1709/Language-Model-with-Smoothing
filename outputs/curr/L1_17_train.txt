For this very reason, we cannot agree to cut pensions further.	1.1943149061839364
There is an agreement on this issue which provides for a review in 2001 and this must not take place one moment sooner.	1.3419600602486899
What is more, the relevant cost dynamic is completely under control.	0.9408284086731602
I would therefore ask the Commission to please refrain from taking this unacceptable ideological approach and making such declarations which create instability and uncertainty among the citizens.	0.9867802568875591
I referred to the case of Italy, not only because the President is very familiar with it, but because Community statistics (Eurostat) themselves reveal that not only has Italy' s welfare expenditure - currently 25.9% - been below the Community average (28.2%) since 1990, but that it has also been well below that of countries considered to be doing well, such as Germany (29.9%) and France (30.8%).	1.297668219304158
Europe' s role: we first need to emphasise that Europe rejects war as an instrument for resolving international conflict: only then can we talk of the 'military' role of the Union.	1.1700080379066722
Agriculture and health: we see the issue differently from the Commission: in our view there are no consumers: there are only citizens who want to eat healthy food - products which are not designed for competitiveness but health, quality and respect for the environment.	1.4171814360741355
Moreover, these are factors which create employment.	1.3515437210151426

(FR) The proposed action and programme presented by Mr Prodi are vague in the extreme and the social question is missing yet again.	1.234098859928031
In fact, the word seems to have been banished from the Commission' s vocabulary, whereas liberal and American references abound.	1.3577426095865708
Mr Prodi reverts to the contested concept of 'governance' ; contested because it favours state intervention over a proper working democracy and refers to the notion as defined by the IMF, whose ideological agenda is predicated solely on liberalism and monetarism.	1.0045540860403948
The shift in meaning is not just semantic... The only logical thing to do on reading this document is to pursue the mass market and generalised deregulation and forget about the realignment of European policy which our citizens hoped for.	1.220151589271905
Mr Prodi talks solely of 'mechanisms' and 'structures' and fails to set out a single balanced project which responds to the aspirations of our people.	0.9255311344362344
Enlargement appears to be an end in itself, but unless decisions are made on a social policy, a common value and an institution to strengthen the cohesion and democratisation of the Union, the Europe bequeathed to us at the end of Mr Prodi' s presidency may well be a simple common market area within the context of generalised globalisation, rather than the community of destiny which we hope for.	1.3966420519022662
Finally, Mr Prodi' s complacency towards the Austrian Government in the name of an exaggerated sense of protocol (which in no way obliges him to send a message of congratulations) would in itself warrant a vote of no confidence.	1.278938649768299

(FR) The European Union is flaunting its unbridled expansionist ambitions.	1.1897158667568
The Commission' s objective for the next five years is to become a 'global actor' by showing 'genuine leadership on the world stage' .	1.1509942063981875
The nature of the EU has not changed.	1.2831589894239042
Since the beginning it has served the interests of a few dozen large financial and industrial groups and their pressure groups.	1.1620964300647236
But the Prodi Commission now wants to transform the EU so that it can apply for joint global governance with the United States, which it also sees as its future competitor and rival.	1.1616132601063291
This new imperial policy advocates reorganising European and national institutions, strengthening the power of the state, increasing competition, establishing a European army and redistributing financial resources.	1.097043185467008
Even daring to refer to the defence of a 'European social model' is a shamefaced lie because the more the EU combats the United States, the more it becomes its clone.	1.2451251277707067
We shall vote against these objectives, because we are fighting against this policy both in Parliament and on the streets.	1.2373890721796992
A European charter of fundamental rights would be the only ray of light in this policy but, yet again, there is no provision for the people of Europe themselves to be able to address and decide on this democratically.	1.3555520887873604
We abstained from the vote on the motion for a resolution for the following reasons.	0.8673151238847534
Firstly, the motion does not condemn clearly enough the vagueness of the priorities and commitments indicated in the Commission' s programme.	1.2378567358851091
Secondly, in terms of the definition of priorities for the next five years, we consider that the main question to be considered by the Commission is its role in interinstitutional relations within the EU which neither the programme nor the motion mention.	1.4743721688479137
In our opinion, the Commission' s role in the near future will be dependent on some of the European political initiative being returned by the governments of the Member States following the Santer Commission scandal.	1.2736875916415202
This is very positive as this is how the national parliaments, on which the governments depend, will continue to show that their democratic mandate is indispensable to European construction.	1.3852221915406193
The truth is that the European Parliament is still failing to gain the confidence and interest of national public opinion which is determined not to think about Europe, as demonstrated by the low turnout in the recent elections.	1.299528281525364
The mechanisms used in the cooperation between the governments of the Member States must therefore be reinforced and made more coherent, more transparent and more democratic.	1.1885695957296905
We welcome the efforts of Mr Prodi to improve the public image of the Commission and the need for the latter to agree with this House and the Council.	1.629871731447101
However, the priority should be to reform the governmental cooperation mechanisms, particularly by creating a Council of Ministers for Europe which, by itself and in coordination with the other European institutions, can assume the responsibility for transforming the political decisions of the European Councils into specific actions.	1.5256449029864183
Corrie report (A5-0032/2000)	0.5763060279719239
Madam President, the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly was coloured in 1999 by growing concern about the sustainability of the cooperation models derived from the Lomé Conventions.	1.018450192030051
Back in 1994, the Joint Assembly passed an initial resolution, in which our fellow Member Dominique Souchet was closely involved, expressing its alarm at the foreseeable consequences of the Uruguay Round, which contradicted the very principle of Community preference which was fundamental to this cooperation.	1.2348286976251246
These fears have been taking shape over the last two years and the banana row is the clearest expression of them.	1.0389242188976269
The developing countries are asked to fall into line with the liberalisation of trade, despite their vulnerable economies.	1.1600533475537442
Although Mr Corrie' s report roundly condemns this situation and reaffirms the Joint Assembly' s attachment to the Lomé model, he fails to highlight properly a second problem which, to tell the truth, is also the result of the free-trade error, namely the incoherence of the regional trade agreements signed by the European Union.	1.3539874009033162
The cooperation agreement with South Africa is a prime example.	0.805800814552704
The Council approved the agreement negotiated by the Commission despite the fact that a basic section, namely agriculture, had not been finalised.	1.3607128665219717
As Paul-Marie Coûteaux rightly said in his intervention yesterday and in his proposed amendments, one wonders exactly what political coherence this blank cheque represents.	1.016046167623545
It is most worrying, especially as a similar agreement with Mexico appears to be taking shape.	1.2586973469388663
Nor is it possible to support the rapporteur' s call for the European Development Fund to be merged with the Community budget.	1.2063023029485676
We want to maintain the clear commitment and the responsibility of each Member State, which is made possible by its intergovernmental nature.	1.2613498663842935
Alas, there have been far too many instances of collective aid for which no-one feels responsible being derailed and we do not want to extend this disastrous system to the EDF.	1.1701023635463146
Madam President, I welcome Mr Corrie' s report as a balanced assessment of the work the Assembly has carried out over the last year.	1.3954814217590936
The report comes just after agreement has been reached on the renewal of the existing Lomé Convention, which expires at the end of this month.	1.082225942697081
The new agreement provides for a development budget of EUR 13.5 billion over the next seven years.	0.9642398360103964
It is vital that this money is used to benefit the poorest groups and individuals within the ACP countries.	1.1341326997834482
Strenuous efforts must be made to root out corruption and waste.	0.8925074717518585
Civil society must be involved in the planning and implementation of these projects.	0.8133979515467701
The decision to include a clause obliging ACP countries to take back illegal immigrants entering Europe is worrying and will have to be implemented with extreme sensitivity.	1.2815516099957978
I hope that before the end of this new Lomé Convention we will be able to welcome Cuba as a full member.	1.447334502992203
. The joint United Nations programme on AIDS estimated that by the end of 1998, there was a total of 33.4 million people in the world living with the HIV infection.	1.267778732949549
Over 95% of all HIV infected individuals live in the developing countries and sub-Saharan Africa is the worst affected region in the world.	1.12122491895182
While only around 10% of the world' s population live in sub-Saharan Africa, 70% of all people who became infected with the AIDS virus in 1998 live there.	1.1897045698929247
80% of the 13.9 million AIDS related deaths in the world have taken place in this region.	1.2533355248884084
The AIDS problem in Africa is not only a private or public health issue but a development one.	1.1264880358068965
The effects of the AIDS pandemic mean that any progress in development matters in the sub-Saharan region is being neutralised or reversed.	0.9004197330160463
From the data which I am referring to today, it is evident that this disease is taking a disproportionate toll on the developing countries least capable of responding to its wide-ranging impact.	1.1780839726370493
It is clear that the spread of AIDS in the sub-Saharan African Continent is linked to poverty.	0.8587288991862495
AIDS treatments that may cost $18 000 per annum for one person are obviously not affordable by countries whose annual health budget may be less than $5 per capita.	0.8744373942854143
It is incumbent on the European Union and the United Nations to address what is a social and fatal problem in a comprehensive and strategic manner.	1.3678269364812592
We must primarily ensure that the basic needs of the poorest people in the countries most affected by the AIDS disease are fully met. These countries include Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.	1.2393730002864738
Prevention education should begin early in the primary school curriculum in these countries.	0.8920827286902432
Appropriate messages about the health effects of AIDS must be delivered to primary school children by teachers who are comfortable with the information that they are trying to communicate.	0.9608358381629741
Health facilities and staff of NGOs need to be supported and resourced to deal effectively and appropriately with patients.	1.0344896675696424
It is essential that these groups are able to obtain the limited resources they require to be effective.	1.166946802351129
At a more central level, there is a need for more effective co-ordination between government donors, international NGOs, indigenous NGOs and private sector initiatives so that scarce resources are not wasted.	1.0230688650450874
Already weak economies are being further weakened in Africa by the AIDS virus.	0.9200719767553736
Already stretched resources are being further stretched.	0.8363015602248838
50% or more of hospital beds are now occupied by someone suffering with an AIDS related disease in the countries where AIDS figures are highest.	1.131867139098018
On a separate matter altogether, I would like to support Cuba' s membership as an ACP country within the framework of the new Lomé Convention which will shortly be agreed between the European Union and African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.	1.174476453843709
I know that this is somewhat controversial, particularly, because of the attitude of the United States Government towards the Castro regime.	1.2317443928554115
However, on this occasion, the European Union will be insisting on introducing political criteria into the Lomé Convention Accord.	1.668592736126848
Good governance criteria broadly covering questions of refugees, corruption, human rights and democracy will be part of the finalised accord between the European Union and all countries signing the Lomé Convention from Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific region.	1.21998225460677

(FR) The Lomé Convention, on which the entire structure of relations between the European Union and the 71 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries rests, is still the most efficient and ambitious development tool in north-south relations.	1.2207922472925652
After years of 'good and loyal service' it is still the main symbol of efforts by the European Union to promote development and improve the lot of the poorest countries.	1.2796425276878909
It is the humane face of Europe...	1.0803043104797632
And the merit of Mr Corrie' s report is that it highlights the value of this original, proactive development instrument, together with the work carried out by the Joint Assembly.	1.0242364009487792
Especially as the vulnerable architecture of this ambitious structure has been threatened.	0.8997909154951063
The partnership between the European Union and the ACP was negotiated in the difficult time of the changeover to the new millennium.	1.3728081062792223
I am delighted that reason and generosity triumphed over the difficulties, opening new prospects for this partnership.	0.9507327007438233
Now, more than 30 years after the inauguration of an unprecedented partnership between north and south, the tool which has proven its worth and served its time needs to be adapted in order to meet new challenges.	1.2402156810408638
Which is why the new 20-year agreement due to be signed in Fiji on 31 May represents more than the simple renewal of the Conventions regulating relations between Europe and the ACP.	1.2053331957023465
It should seal their revival.	0.4811366269859973
It brilliantly illustrates the political dimension of a partnership which constitutes the only forum for dialogue and political exchange within north-south relations.	0.9110402256810004
At a time when the Joint Assembly is opening its doors ever wider to the elected representatives from parliaments in the ACP, this dimension must not only be preserved; above all, it must be encouraged.	1.3246445561697353
The Joint Assembly also represents the tribunal before which the countries of Europe and the developing countries defend their common interests.	1.1696442612622004
After the debacle in Seattle, our duty from now on is to adopt a concerted position and ensure that the rules of world trade develop and are used to fight poverty.	1.23766886229427
The partnership is here to stay and the way is clear for it to be modernised.	1.2304896710445
First, by promoting a trend towards regional meetings of the Joint Assembly, as recommended in the Corrie report, thereby enabling working methods to be adapted to the new types of cooperation envisaged (regional economic partnership agreements).	1.3021102475489994
Then, by gearing actions to micro-projects and making them accessible to the civil society in the southern countries and, finally, by calling for enlargement and the rapid accession of Cuba, which all the ACP called for at Nassau and which has now made a formal application.	1.4117816922319404
But we must also preserve the original spirit of the Lomé Convention, which has enabled relations between the European Union and the ACP to become what they are today: a real partnership based on fairness and mutual respect.	1.3088356187974592
.	-0.0
(FR) A few days after the demonstrations in Seattle, the ministers of the European Union imposed an agreement compatible with the rules of the WTO on the ACP, i.e. their former colonies.	1.4835062755248218
Apart from reducing the volume of exports from these countries to the Community market, what we term 'development aid' to the ACP has fallen constantly, from 70% of total European Union aid in 1986 to 30% in 1998.	1.3308883056697844
The European Union prefers to send its funds to Eastern Europe, the former USSR and Asia, where there is greater opportunity for profit.	1.330820369444184
The ACP-EU agreements make a mockery of democratic principles and the fight against corruption, by sparing those who are responsible: when will sanctions and controls be imposed on Total-Elf, which is supplying those responsible for the civil war in the Congo?	1.243189214757436
Or on Shell?	0.34460697728593714
Although the market is presented as the only rule which applies to ACP-EU relations, the European Union also plans to police immigration, as article 13 hints, in order to justify the policy of the European states against illegal immigrants.	1.4696275507688956
We do not accept this agreement, which deprives people of the wherewithal to build societies which are independent of the European multinationals and banks.	1.4048088979653444
. Mr President, I am full of praise at the sterling efforts of MEPs --some of my Labour colleagues among them - on the ACP-EU Joint Assembly and their efforts towards securing a new Lomé Agreement, which will benefit some of the poorest countries in the world.	1.3137641178534893
Few of my constituents will probably be aware that the EU is the biggest foreign aid donor in the world.	1.1504324640718546
While others may have the biggest rockets, the EU has the deepest pockets.	1.332867855422541
This is something that the EU can rightly be proud of, and I think we should shout it from the rooftops more often.	1.3968303880352477
The Labour Government' s record in Britain is also a proud one.	0.9375354398699903
Clare Short, MP, is one of the few Cabinet-level Ministers for international development in the world and, as such, can take her case to the very heart of government.	1.4316754142244696
Gordon Brown, MP, meanwhile, has led international efforts to relieve crippling levels of Third World debt and ensured that Labour' s campaign to reduce poverty does not end at the English Channel.	1.0201190542657967
Whether through the minimum wage in Manchester or debt relief in Durban, Labour' s aim of poverty reduction remains the same.	0.8217602657524291
There is still much to be done, however.	1.2282887127826492
The next great challenge is to re-launch the new round of world trade negotiations that failed to take off last December in Seattle.	0.8888450703098603
It must be a 'development round' , in which developing countries, effectively excluded from previous rounds, are fully included.	1.439633635080775
For the best way to reduce world poverty is to help developing countries help themselves.	1.012428927489005
Developing countries want trade not aid, a help up not a hand-out.	1.0347333791411508
And the best way to help developing countries help themselves is to open up world markets to allow them to sell their products.	0.985795818115775
In this way, the power of globalisation can be harnessed for the good, to benefit the poor not just the wealthy, the many not just the few.	1.4471421277549281
Thus, whether through the New Deal in Newcastle or fair trade in Freetown, Labour' s aim of opportunity for all remains the same.	0.9842567372760063
Swoboda report (A5-0031/2000)	0.576762853275946
. (EL) The EU' s Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in the form of a joint agreement as established by Article 310 of the EU Treaty, can contribute to the stabilisation and development of that Balkan republic.	1.2751290729417262
In parallel, it can benefit from substantial financial support via the PHARE programme.	1.1806419654391476
However, the EU' s present policy in the Balkans is fragmentary, inconsistent and schizophrenic in nature.	1.419745061566857
There are different types of agreements or relations or lack of relations - going even as far as the embargo on Yugoslavia - which result in a fragmented and ineffectual approach.	1.2662450939796166
There is no sense of regionality for the Balkans, which would include everyone without exceptions or vindictiveness.	1.255124102771196
Finally, intervention by the European Union to solve the problem of FYROM' s name - which is unfortunately becoming a long drawn out problem and could make an already tense situation even more fraught - and to respond more energetically towards negotiating FYROM' s principles within a reasonable time scale, is necessary and useful.	1.4495089471880975
.	-0.0
(FR) The Commission' s stated desire to strengthen relations between the European Union and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and to grant this country the prospect of full integration into the Community would appear to respond to a primary concern: a political entity which respects nations and their sovereignty could no longer postpone sending a signal to these states in south-east Europe which history has shown no consideration for since the end of the Second World War.	1.113073632622824
Having been crushed beneath the heel of triumphant Communism, this region has not stopped paying the price for the collapse of the Soviet system since the beginning of the 1990s.	1.1217552353510731
And yet, under these difficult conditions, especially since the military intervention in the Balkans by NATO, some of these genuinely European countries have demonstrated a sense of responsibility which entitles them to aspire to join the Community.	1.2885000333064514
In this sense, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is both an exemplary and a symbolic case.	0.933553718216913
Exemplary because it proves that the Balkan countries are not at the mercy of fate and that those of them which so wish are already in a position to meet the standard requirements imposed by the European Union in stability and association agreements.	1.2823865084910002
Symbolic because it reflects well on the Fifteen' s project to see the birth of a policy which is common to the five countries in the region (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, FYROM and Albania) and which would make economic and political stability a pressing and urgent requirement.	1.249208716398201
The UEN Group is all the more in favour of sending this signal to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia because it leaves plenty of room for the independence and sovereignty of the states. A satisfactory solution cannot be found in the Balkans without a strong policy of cooperation between the states concerned; but nor can there be any question of blocking their process of integration because one of them is considered unworthy of such promotion.	1.175953190995456
The Union is simply doing its job when it seeks through its cooperation policy to encourage nations to espouse a platform of common values with it, of which democracy and civil liberty are the cornerstone.	1.1592053946897383
It is not its job to subrogate to people in their choices or, failing that, reinvent a new variation on a 'sense of history' which perceives self-determination as a one-way street.	1.1463807567411088
The Community construction only makes sense if it creates positive discriminations alone, and the UEN Group hopes that this signal to FYROM and specific action in its wake will help us make a sustainable contribution to the development and peaceful coexistence of the nation states in this fully-paid up part of Europe.	1.2032905515416283
Frassoni Report (A5-0021/2000)	0.5922495323492025
. (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Mrs Monica Frassoni' s report, according to which the European Parliament is to accept the agreement entered into with the Commission about the implementing provisions for the Council' s decision of 28 June 1999 concerning comitology.	1.2899695028742895
In all matters, we attach importance to the fact that there should be the greatest possible transparency in connection with the decision-making procedures involved in EU cooperation, for example with a view to guaranteeing the necessary democratic control.	1.465581665793625
Through the agreement, the European Parliament will automatically be sent the relevant material in connection with decisions made in accordance with the rules under Article 251 of the Treaty.	1.2717212911969078
We should also like to see this arrangement extended to other areas in which, following the agreement, the European Parliament' s relevant committees will be sent material when they ask for it.	1.296213641841477
With the approval of this agreement, we have not achieved the final goal of transparency and democratic control where the comitology procedures are concerned. However, it constitutes real progress in the right direction, which is something we do not wish to obstruct.	1.4019576800848619

Company restructuring in Europe	0.1078857968451457
The next item is the Commission statement - Company restructuring in Europe.	1.0865599175269454
. Mr President, industrial change, which can be gradual or sudden, is driven by new technologies, worldwide competition or consumer preferences.	1.2782156612868418
It has economic implications and an impact on employment and social cohesion, but it also provides major new opportunities when anticipated, prepared for and managed.	1.1949978093257525
The acceleration of technological progress and the increasing competitive pressure of globalising markets are pushing companies to rapidly adapt their production and company structures.	0.8907776320817798
Companies must be able to anticipate and identify at an early stage what they need to do to ensure the continuity of their activities.	1.2211760141738603
Sometimes this calls for mergers of activities.	0.5875669647701243
The Commission is acutely aware of this situation and of the need for people to feel basic security in difficult times of change.	1.2935623298210295
We are convinced that the cornerstone of successful adaptation to change is dialogue at all levels and with full and transparent information as its basis.	1.0013040926573136
We have had in the recent past different experiences and approaches on how to deal with large-scale operations of corporate restructuring, often affecting the lives of large numbers of European people.	0.9897569959472899
In some cases these operations were prepared well in advance, fully involving workers' representatives, with due care being taken to search for the least damaging solutions.	1.212249704456839
Where necessary, workers likely to be affected were prepared through employability measures to face the challenge of sudden unemployment.	1.0253627010474862
In other cases these operations were launched and implemented with less care and concern for those affected.	0.9049961624341029
On every occasion, and as recently as last October in this House, the Commission has highlighted the following basic positions.	1.418095989884557
Firstly, decisions on corporate restructuring remain the prerogative as well as the responsibility of management.	1.400884875929452
This means that, when contemplating actions likely to lead to serious social consequences, job losses for example, companies should always actively search for and choose the least negative and least damaging solution.	1.2088744269609681
Secondly, when dismissals prove to be inevitable, the utmost must be done to reinforce the employability of those concerned.	1.424897691996786
This requires anticipation, timely preparation and careful management of these processes.	0.8719917633251871
Thirdly, nothing can justify the absence of timely, effective and comprehensive information and consultation of the workers' and employees' representatives before such operations are launched or publicly announced.	1.255979860741211
Worker involvement is always, and particularly in the event of corporate restructuring, not only a basic right but a necessary precondition for the social acceptance of such operations.	1.4113716222614212
In the end it is also a decisive factor of their success, as no collectivity can survive and prosper without trust, dialogue, partnership and solidarity between its different components.	1.2362837879120807
These basic ideas meet with a wide consensus in Europe.	0.855292769377007
This is what intelligent restructuring is about.	1.0405362449006788
It is more and more rare to see companies embark on damaging restructuring operations ignoring these fundamental concerns, as unfortunately was sometimes the case in the past.	1.0239015665962312
We have built a wide range of instruments which meet these concerns in recent years in the European Union.	1.0720394784507505
We have set minimum requirements at European level, which all Member States and all companies must observe when contemplating job losses, especially when they are massive, or preparing other decisions likely to affect workers.	1.4066783079262812
The collective redundancies and transfers of undertakings directive and the European works council directive constitute our legal framework, protecting the workers' rights and ensuring fair standards in the field of information and consultation at national and transnational level respectively.	1.1231556338882362
As regards the national and/or local level of employee involvement, the Commission wishes to underline again the need for proper information and consultation of employees' representatives before any redundancies are decided or implemented, as provided for in the collective redundancies directive and in other national provisions.	1.333794389266127
I wish to recall that it is, in principle, up to national courts to deal with possible violations of these rules, if and when they are brought before them by national representatives.	1.2500844683367376
However, even when existing rules or arrangements are formally respected this does not mean that management' s attitude is socially irreprehensible.	1.3298715966380221
In fact, the Commission has argued for some time now that the rules we have established are not sufficient to deal with the challenges of today.	1.4576318515383009
In a world characterised by permanent change and in the context of high levels of unemployment, the rules in force seem to us to be outdated as they do not allow or promote the key ideas behind our employment strategy and our approach to change, anticipation, risk prevention and employability.	1.1915523245035655
That is why in November 1998 the Commission presented a proposal for a directive on worker information and consultation which has since then received your strong support.	1.1673844108594005
We thank you for that.	1.1101013425557213
Unfortunately, the other branch of the legislative power, the Council, has not yet - more than one year after the presentation of the proposal - begun working on it.	1.569031016513399
I hope that this debate contributes to reminding Member States of the importance and urgent nature of this initiative.	1.4670750641952908
We have recently heard from the Portuguese Presidency that a serious debate on this proposal will soon be launched.	1.3345610177335294
The forthcoming French Presidency also seems willing to give this dossier the high priority it deserves.	0.9526524422942872
The Commission sincerely hopes that Parliament and the Council quickly finalise this important dossier which constitutes, in our view, the most effective answer to the concerns raised by cases such as the ones which brought us here today.	1.2897369779466648
As for the transnational level of employee involvement there is some indication that at least in one case the companies may have breached transnational information and consultation agreements which they had concluded with their European workforce.	1.1773627676267144
They may have at least exploited some ambiguity in the legal and contractual framework in force.	0.9797360212276028
The Commission will contact the relevant national authorities to check this.	1.3102683692114436
In any case, I wish to say to those who believe that their rights in that respect were ignored that adequate means of enforcement and redress are available to them, notably through relevant national jurisdictional instances.	1.2599447965233557
The Commission is aware of your request to proceed immediately with a revision of the European Works Council Directive.	1.1246917650274686
As recognised in the report, which we will adopt in the forthcoming weeks, we accept that the directive contains some loopholes.	1.525791556747508
Nevertheless, as my colleague, Commissioner Diamantopoulou has already underlined on other occasions, when deciding whether or not to revise the directive immediately, different considerations must be taken into account.	1.4089379587478414
First, any revision of the directive would have little immediate effect on existing agreements, unless the fundamental principle of respecting the autonomy of the negotiating parties no longer applies.	1.2939410609864153
Secondly, an immediate revision would make things much more complicated as regards progress in respect of the other pending dossiers in this field like European company statutes and the national information and consultation proposal.	1.3265371389154736
The successful outcome of these other dossiers could greatly facilitate the subsequent revision of the EWC Directive and even provide some degree of a solution to the problems identified above.	0.97674340171923
That is why we tend to consider that it might be more appropriate in this context to proceed with the revision of the European Works Council Directive only after the conclusion of those two dossiers and following a more complete evaluation of the application of the directive.	1.2478834693156629
Action is not limited to legislation.	0.8060136689547184
To encourage and support dialogue as the cornerstone of the successful adaptation to change the Commission is also developing the recommendations of the Lillehammer Report by preparing the setting up of a European observatory on industrial change.	1.131187168954596
We are also developing another suggestion of that expert group, the Managing Change Report.	1.2198133810388716
Let me finish by addressing some of the other concerns expressed in the draft resolution submitted to this House.	1.1837411795739596
As for the enforcement of the links between competition policy and social policy, let me remind you that there is a provision in the merger regulation which enables workers' representatives to be heard by the Commission in the framework of the relevant procedure.	1.252879583660939
Generally speaking, we recognise the need for proper consideration to be given in different instances to all aspects surrounding these kinds of operations, including their effects in terms of employment.	1.301835173744155
As an example of this I mention that public authorities, notably the Commission, have already taken measures through guidelines on national regional aid that came into force on 1 January this year so as to ensure that public funding remains associated with the recipients of regional aid and consequently with the jobs attached to the investment.	1.2252192022869262
To this end all regional aid is made conditional on the maintenance of the investment in question for a minimum period of five years.	1.067563171860436
The same provision was included in the Structural Funds Regulation which means that it applies to all investments cofinanced by the structural funds.	1.0689034495701677
Social cohesion and the interplay of policies at EU-level is the focus of the forthcoming Lisbon Summit.	1.175817022560758
I know we will be coming back to these issues again in the future to see how we can best make sure our policies are adapted and reformed to underpin economic and social progress in Europe.	1.2462812799411849
Thank you very much Commissioner.	0.850446390633062
Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso, I understand you have a point of order.	1.3170161508102947
If it is a personal statement, would you be prepared to wait until the end of this debate, at which stage I would be happy to call you?	1.4599439501671267
Mr President, the problem is one of public honour in this Parliament, it is not a personal statement.	1.4814249567380782
This morning, the President of Parliament, Mrs Nicole Fontaine, repeatedly refused to allow me to make a point of order.	1.2300188227116167
Unfortunately, this is not the first time that Madam President has shown this inadmissible behaviour towards me.	1.2112007069131852
In doing so, Madam President has breached Rule 142 that states that points of order shall take precedence over all other requests to speak.	1.0260829089759955
She has also breached Rule 122 that gives the right to all the Members of this House to make observations, observations which in this case refute the remarks made by another deputy, Mr Vidal-Quadras.	1.254330028775681
This partisan behaviour of our President should be criticised most firmly.	0.7888047150963332
I will willingly accept Madam President' s apologies any time.	0.7299135618648611
Thank you for your statement.	0.6156736385761001
We will certainly make sure that the President is informed of your statement.	1.2480555202903816
I can assure you that as far as I am aware the President never likes to have a debate on issues in the middle of a vote.	1.227957773313144
Therefore the House was probably quite willing to go ahead at that stage.	0.9228618538179879
But thank you for your remarks.	0.9963522310920795
Mr President, I welcome Commissioner Liikanen' s words, and I am contributing to the debate - we are all contributing to the debate - because, although the subject is broad in scope, it also concerns a specific fact.	1.5646533967522818
The subject in question is of great political and social importance.	1.2784855461888534
Free enterprise, free movement and free competition are essential pillars of the political and economic structure of the European Union.	1.2379061931497286
Company restructuring is part of the principle of free determination of investments, and must therefore be defended.	1.2168484358692309
However, all too often we witness events which are in stark contrast with these principles.	1.4104634459016858
Today, we are witnessing one of these cases, which, on the surface, may seem to be of minor importance and affect only the specific industry, but which, if it is allowed to pass without an authoritative intervention by the European Union, will become an unwritten rule which will cause problems for many of the Member States and the Union as a whole.	1.4583702764487736
An American company - Goodyear - with production sites in Italy, Germany and England, is reviewing its production and relocation, justifiably, in its own view.	1.36523386336546
However, it seems to be doing it without observing the relevant Community legislation, for it is certainly not giving reasonable notice to employees or heeding the obligation to render an account of their use of Italian and European public finances.	1.2436678865711985
In Italy, Commissioner Liikanen, Goodyear is not carrying out restructuring but closing a plant whose production covers 14% of the market and which Goodyear itself defined as, 'having the most highly-skilled workforce of all its plants' , a plant which was opened with a total of EUR 85 million of European capital.	1.2548365183444208
No notice was given of the closure, and no intention was shown of discussing the fate of the plant or its workers, despite the fact that the public funds invested in that plant make it much more public than private.	1.2662624730733163
It would be a serious matter if every non-European company were to learn to use Europe as a bus where you do not have to pay for the ticket, you do not have to pay for cooperation, you benefit from using the facility and you leave without being accountable to anyone.	1.2976569692740685
Europe has to guarantee every sort of freedom, including freedom to use one' s own money for the purposes of one' s own freedom and not to let others use it at will, others who make demands and then, when the break is made, refuse even to discuss the terms of the break, despite the fact that this is a break which has been declared unilaterally.	1.3353091409737277
Just now, Commissioner Liikanen was talking of restructuring which must not be uninformed.	1.235713716068074
Sadly, in this case, he has not taken into account those who are affected and seems not to have considered those carrying out the restructuring.	1.4101533891570333
I would also like to point out to Commissioner Liikanen that it is not easy to take a matter to a national court.	1.317107962527569
Of course, it is always possible, but when jobs have been lost and factories closed down, the idea of going to Court when proceedings are as lengthy as they are in Italy is not very reassuring.	1.458211589158773
Commissioner Liikanen, we expect an authoritative intervention.	1.0283229317621778
As Parliament, we are, of course, expecting to be able to contribute to the resolution you mentioned - we are ready and waiting - but we expect an authoritative intervention on this, which can on no account be allowed to reach its conclusion and be forgotten, as has almost happened already.	1.4865760442657787
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for the second time within the space of four months, we find ourselves debating the restructuring of companies in Europe.	1.150694075990445
This is - as it was the first time round - sparked off by the reorganisation of large companies, which is linked to a drop in employment.	1.4528571547308822
I would like to make it quite clear that the Liberal Group is against any political interference in companies, in terms of both finance and management.	1.1542178089440145
Our task is to draft legislation and to monitor to ensure that it is observed.	1.0987771535742383
It appears that Goodyear in Italy received Italian and European subsidies to the tune of approximately EUR 40 million.	0.9672286842400588
The company went under despite this.	0.549098276670027
This goes to show that jobs cannot be bought.	0.8013265658940801
The market is a law unto itself.	0.899335321381545
As such, state aid costs the government twice: first in subsidies and then in unemployment benefit.	1.1365923563025035
Surely this cannot be the role of your, my and the citizens' tax money?	1.3829076333524153
All this, of course, does not mean that our Group does not share the concern of the Italian Members regarding the effects of the closure on the region concerned.	1.1908937511118924
My Group is also opposed in principle to the naming of specific companies in this resolution, for two reasons: firstly because this creates selective responsibility.	1.2766775417852123
A company is pilloried one day and not the next.	1.0127116876454443
Why should this be the case?	1.0678628853225693
Michelin caused a great stir.	0.642259803563384
But I did not hear a squeak when Nissan and IBM were discussed, where, similarly, a great number of European employees were involved.	1.230762095857161
Secondly, this is not fair towards employees of other companies where reorganisations also take place and where it hurts too.	1.3837964865646357
My Group has signed a joint resolution with EPP and UEN, in which, however, we made it clear right from the outset that we are against the naming of company names.	1.3702315426683427
This is why the Liberal Group will vote against paragraph 8 and the second section of paragraph 9.	1.244632840665224
If these paragraphs are nonetheless adopted, my Group will abstain from the final vote.	0.9376770492398846
I do hope that this will not be necessary.	1.0839275413903136
Mr President, the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission' s strategic objectives for 2000-2005 both talk of full employment for which two essential conditions are required.	1.1560091806948225
The first is to create new jobs for young people entering the labour market and the second is not to lose jobs.	1.5970652923440594
Yet the current situation in Europe provides us with clear examples of how jobs are being destroyed, particularly, and most seriously, by companies which are making huge profits.	1.3522534653509395
In the past, workers were asked to show their solidarity with companies in order to ensure their survival. Now the companies are making huge profits but are also making workers redundant.	1.1897540383456302
Examples have been given in Spain of Michelin and ABB-Alsthom and my colleagues will give examples for Italy.	1.0024036598011192
There is also another hidden way of making workers redundant, as practised for example in Spain by the Ericsson company under the term 'externalising' . Note that sensitive words like 'redundancy' are not used.	1.1808778774581514
Externalising services by subcontracting these to contract companies results in stable and permanent jobs being turned into precarious jobs without union or social rights.	0.8192763508169595
This is just an underhand way of making workers redundant.	0.7155737313763466
Commissioner, if the European institutions really believe in what they say about full employment, they must take clear steps to secure this.	1.578440423520368
They must revise the directives in order to guarantee the participation of workers in these negotiations. They must revise the directive on collective redundancies, reduce the working day, link European subsidies to a clear commitment to maintain employment and include social and labour clauses in the international agreements signed by the European Union.	1.248711991785657
Mr President, sadly, once again, Parliament is having to discuss the restructuring of companies in Europe.	1.1484969200908934
Yet again, workers are likely to lose their jobs.	0.8751218251263696
This time, I am referring to the workers of the company Goodyear in Cisterna di Latina.	1.0853354101688697
As has already been pointed out, in one month' s time, 600 people and as many families could be deprived of their sole source of income.	1.1602863512799335
Despite the commitment they have shown to the company and despite their high level of professionalism - which has made the Cisterna plant one of the most productive in Europe - these workers are likely to be removed from the production cycle, while Goodyear, after years of benefiting from state and European subsidies, is totally free to walk out.	1.4022545625215026
I do not think this is at all fair, either to the workers at the Cisterna plant or to all those Italian and European citizens whose taxes have, albeit indirectly, enabled Goodyear to benefit from the state aids I have just mentioned.	1.3130686053991583
The European Commission and the Council must, at last, assume all the necessary responsibilities, both with regard to the adoption of a common position on the information and consultation of workers and with regard to Community and national aid, which must only be granted to companies who undertake to establish long-term agreements to protect jobs.	1.4324865660479682
Today, we ask the Commission to start by protecting the workers at Goodyear in Cisterna, and therefore to put as much pressure as possible on the company for it to come to an agreement as soon as possible, thereby ensuring the continued existence and operation of the Cisterna plant.	1.3048091311199637
Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to remind the House that there is very little time available, and therefore that any measure - including those already cited by the Commission in its introductory report - which we adopt must have an immediate, timely effect.	1.494788760927408
Mr President, Commissioner, as far as restructuring goes, there is no doubt that European companies must adapt so that they are better placed to face new challenges or go under.	1.18004096280661
We are well aware of this current economic context and that the purpose of restructuring is to rationalise corporate management.	1.082774933976569
Although it is laudable from an economic point of view to make structural changes in order to be more competitive and win market shares, this approach may be reprehensible if it is made at the request of financiers, often shareholders, with the sole unavowed aim of increasing the financial standing of the company in order to raise profits which they can then withdraw from the company.	1.324027538715981
The various recent announcements referred to by previous speakers, be they by Michelin or Goodyear, are symptomatic in this respect.	1.1200351802747326
Rationalised management and improved profits should, in my view, serve the company and hence its employees first and foremost, and any financial benefits should follow.	1.1590446013835167
However, what we witnessing today is the phenomenon of concentration and corporate regrouping and relocation, with all the familiar consequences, both on the quality of products and at the social level, especially in terms of unemployment, difficult working conditions and increased flexibility: consequences which have a drastic effect at the human level, especially on the family unit.	1.2922645654305158
There is a very real risk of seeing a two-headed monster emerge on this planet, with poor countries providing the labour and rich countries providing the capital.	1.1742568387429353
Surely Europe should act as a safeguard, maintaining a certain equilibrium between increased profitability and social welfare?	0.9852310897659036
We must not forget that it is human resources which make a company function at its base and guarantee it good results.	1.1038970140028055
Finally, allow me to remind you that the third letter of the EDD Group to which I belong stands for 'difference' .	1.1567976165043141
Europe has a duty to make its voice heard as an alternative to savage restructuring for profit at all costs. Without doubt, the voice of difference in this monotonous flood of restructuring.	1.0857014923773791
Mr President, last month in the UK, in a region that neighbours mine, the Michelin Group announced significant redundancies at its Stoke-on-Trent plant due to company restructuring and increasing global competitiveness in the world market for tyres.	1.3758870073664227
I, like all Members present, am saddened by this loss of jobs.	1.0980458192214266
Equally, I am saddened by the announcement made by Goodyear that has prompted this resolution.	1.1672940215051704
But I doubt very much indeed whether a European works council would have been able to change this company' s decision.	1.2196877485312694
This House is very good at producing resolutions and legislation and we sometimes, in this institution, forget that Europe cannot survive alone.	1.3349564124472277
We need multinational companies to base their businesses within our continent.	0.7794992054722671
In my few months here, I have found it astonishing that whilst we all talk about the need to encourage businesses to grow within the EU, nearly every resolution we pass actually encourages businesses to leave.	1.2564145525535568
In our last plenary part-session in Brussels we voted on the end-of-life vehicles directive and managed to make the legislation retrospective, adding huge costs for the European motor manufacturers that they could not have predicted.	1.207956292578878
Two days later, Toyota, which employs several thousand people in my region, stated that this directive would not only increase the cost of cars but could well also mean redundancies in their Derbyshire plant.	1.1733622503345362
In a world where surely less regulation is the key, we in this House seem to believe that we can add more regulation and costs on business and that they will stay within the European Union, untempted by other locations elsewhere where there are fewer burdens.	1.376363288997242
We MEPs speak often about SMEs and have now come up with a unique way of creating them.	1.0356288333609995
Take a large successful business, add European regulations, and within months you have created a small one.	1.1046188982117262
Perhaps before we criticise anybody outside this place we should take a good look at ourselves and what we do here.	1.1442643574712699
Mr President, I will not use my speaking time by going into the individual cases debated here today.	1.2267160210478127
In this respect, I share Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel' s view that we cannot talk about these in detail.	1.3249422633540158
But maybe next time, we ought to discuss CORUS, the merger which has now taken place between our Nederlandse Hoogovens and British Steel.	1.256510046743448
I would like to place this discussion in a somewhat wider context and examine the link between policy in the field of company mergers within the European Union and policy in other fields.	1.266680609632856
In this light, I am pleased that Mr Liikanen is present and we do not only have to hold this discussion, where the interests of employees are concerned, with Mrs Diamantopoulou but we can involve the Commissioners who are active in other fields.	1.3952455793880325
I would also like to advocate coherence in the Commission' s policy from these different vantage points, unlike my predecessor, who holds the belief that there is no need for rules.	1.3044731224212363
We need to gain an insight into what companies are like now.	0.9719782553361334
At present, we are witnessing a number of large mergers between companies which originate in an Anglo-Saxon tradition and companies with a Rhineland tradition.	1.0508705010103807
What remains of the concept of what a company should be like now is naturally very relevant: whether it is merely the property and toy of shareholders, or whether it is a more broadly based stakeholder society, which is meant to guarantee continuity for staff, consumers, suppliers and the local population and has, in addition, a social function.	1.3679626985094744
As such, I would like to ask these various Commission directorates and these various Commissioners to provide a wider vision regarding corporate governments.	1.199920098408847
I think that it would also fit in well with the plans which have been presented over the past couple of days on good government in Europe, as company policy forms part of this.	1.4022878128288396
The government is talking to trade union and Goodyear delegates in Italy as well, in an endeavour to find a solution to the closure policy unilaterally adopted by the North American multinational in Cisterna di Latina, an area of Central Italy which has already been affected by other restructuring operations.	1.3079492124269452
The closure means the direct or indirect loss of more than a thousand jobs and hundreds of families being abandoned to insecurity and sudden poverty.	0.8749895593464518
The Goodyear workers are putting up a magnificent fight, in the knowledge that they are defending not only their own interests but the interests of the Goodyear workers in the different European countries as well, and there are many of them: France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Poland, Luxembourg and Slovenia.	1.3596075141257271
Today, a small delegation of workers is here with us in the gallery, anxious to find out what their future will be, what solidarity the European Union will offer them and what policy it will adopt to prevent the multinationals acting solely and exclusively in the interest of their own market and profits.	1.3424349038819208
The European Union, in all of its aspects, must use all of its powers to resolve this and other disputes.	1.6040765492396145
Mr President, earlier this week President Prodi announced that one of the Commission' s strategic objectives for the next five years would be to aim for full employment.	1.251508246298376
He acknowledged that 15 million Europeans are currently looking for work and that unemployment is the main source of poverty and social exclusion.	1.0389349537986874
What is more, the Portuguese Presidency sees the fight against unemployment as top priority.	0.9444021005024034
Yet, all too often these political priorities are invisible in everyday policies.	0.9935735297127296
The Commission' s decision to allow the ABB-Alsthom merger to go ahead is a case in point.	1.2146354019464474
The new company has announced its intention to initiate a restructuring plan with the aim of making savings.	0.9236097299053126
This global restructuring plan could lead to the loss of up to 12 000 jobs.	0.7993142291756111
In my region of the UK in particular the employment consequences of this merger have been severe as a result of ABB-Alsthom having announced that it was cutting 270 jobs in Britain with 95 jobs being lost in Stafford and 112 in Rugby.	1.1503220780367804
The company' s failure to inform the works council about the proposals for the merger is particularly worrying.	0.9754599880502477
It is especially important in the case of large international companies where decisions are taken far from the employee.	1.0083651215497427
Point 17 of the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers stresses the need for consultation, adding that this shall apply especially in companies having establishments in two or more Member States.	1.135807631255024
I do not think it is simply a matter of a Community charter.	1.540321630453876
EU legislation on this issue could not be clearer.	1.040228567610826
The Commission would do well in this sort of situation to make its decisions not simply on the basis of whether a merger will distort competition but also on the basis of the social and economic consequences.	1.2228031069515763
We need more joined-up policy making on these issues.	0.9122586999864227
What we also need urgently is an impact assessment study on the effect of merger in every situation.	1.0997094495853836
This is the only way of respecting Article 127 of the Treaty.	1.08811822510388
I welcome the statement made by Commissioner Liikanen, but I also look for the support of this Parliament to ensure that the legislation which we have passed on workers' rights is implemented rigorously and to ensure that impact assessments on the workforce for proposed mergers are undertaken as a matter of course.	1.4142095317157797
I have received seven motions for resolution tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.	0.7514931462248257
That concludes the debate.	0.19308667519260808
The vote will be taken later this evening.	1.1412291917152213
The sitting was suspended at 3.50 p.m. and resumed at 4.05 p.m.	0.7560879569469271
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE	0.2004388419834845
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.	0.4698836304410891
Racist and xenophobic incidents in El Ejido (Spain)	0.2506847922778797
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:	0.5970435025992148
B5-0149/2000 by Mr Galeote Quecedo and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on outbreaks of racism and xenophobia in the El Ejido area in Spain;	0.9056557724606452
B5-0159/2000 by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm and Mr Sánchez García, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on racist and xenophobic incidents in El Ejido (Spain);	0.804207792198094
B5-0162/2000 by Mrs Díez González and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the outbursts of racism and xenophobia in El Ejido (Spain);	0.8386552667695665
B5-0169/2000 by Mr Puerta and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on outbursts of xenophobia in El Ejido (Spain);	0.8747690284899294
B5-0175/2000 by Mr Bautista Ojeda and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on xenophobia-related incidents in El Ejido (Spain).	0.8449060414136832
Mr President, I am reassured by the fact that the first three speakers in this debate are intimate with this situation given our African origin.	1.4453029519910794
I must firstly congratulate the groups in this House on the high degree of consensus achieved in the motion for a resolution. I am aware of the efforts made by Members to avoid using an issue such as this for electoral purposes.	1.3094695753080887
Secondly, I must also assert my total conviction that neither Spain nor Andalusia is xenophobic or racist. Of course this does not mean that I do not totally condemn the violence used by individuals or groups who deserve to be prosecuted firmly and rigorously by the law, and by the law alone.	1.3271134513246432
We should be tackling the issue of immigration in a comprehensive and rigorous manner.	1.1144399688644644
These events, which are unfortunately overshadowing the political decisions in this area, confirm without doubt that the development of the Tampere Agreements and Title IV of the EC Treaty must be an urgent priority.	1.2932822382647664
Today' s problems cannot be solved in five years.	1.019527070243166
They will take a long time, as we are finding out.	1.3907884388973273
The legislation of the Member States must be brought into line with the agreements of the governments in Tampere, as paragraph 7 of the motion states.	1.4593626979920775
Legal immigrants must be integrated socially without any excuses or delays.	0.790882139860162
Furthermore, the labour market must be organised realistically so that jobs held by third country nationals are subject to labour legislation on wages, social security and social protection in terms of equality. This will eradicate the labour exploitation and markets in marginalised people, which are resulting in the events condemned by the motion, and which are the real basis of the current social problem.	1.4402539265118492
Solidarity, dialogue and agreements between local, regional, national and European institutions and employers, unions and the immigrant communities themselves, whose countries of origin must also undoubtedly assume some responsibility, are essential.	1.2670403739266665
Collaboration with the countries of origin on this issue is vital. In this respect, the action plans approved by the High Level Group and the Tampere European Council must be allocated a budget.	1.4716153580563247
Specifically, I must stress in this debate the plan for Morocco. This is a country with which the European Union has an effective relationship and common interests and which should take particular priority in mutual cooperation and collaboration.	1.5345510073489388
Finally, this House must tackle the phenomenon of immigration with sufficient calm to avoid increasing tension in a debate which must go much further than the appropriate words and condemnations prompted by such behaviour.	1.2042727958930948
This is a very important social debate in the creation of a European area in which the right to freedom, security and justice will be recognised in the future Charter of Fundamental Rights.	1.3105531318407921
Mr President, Commissioner, whenever a serious social problem occurs, it always has a political basis. This is true of the disgraceful events which have recently occurred in El Ejido.	1.301793430189682
The proof of this lies in the fact that the groups in this House have reacted and tabled several motions for resolutions.	1.1594835198079545
We all regret the deaths which have occurred and the violent and disproportionate reactions against the immigrant workers.	0.9041513066088186
We all, I believe, agree in our condemnation of the xenophobia and racism which was apparent in certain actions.	1.0839445389377953
These events certainly have their origin in, among other factors, the absence of a clear immigration policy allowing the affected communities to live together respectfully and peacefully.	1.1681172976364291
We hope that the events in El Ejido will serve as a lesson to everyone and will not be repeated.	1.1024355951363622
Yet it is not enough to regret the situation.	1.0770512612190983
We do not want Africa to become our cross, in fact quite the contrary.	1.5518795859060057
We must therefore act.	1.052534743433427
I should like to highlight certain measures which we are trying to introduce in another European region affected by immigration - the Canary Islands.	1.3526236950149353
Firstly we are creating a network of reception centres for minors.	0.8139653928955641
Secondly we are conducting a programme of social integration.	0.9947646617350543
Thirdly we are carrying out education programmes on tolerance and respect.	0.7385175423679873
Finally we are producing a census of immigrants.	0.6851816742901169
I hope that these measures will help towards ensuring compliance with the Tampere Agreements on immigration and the new Spanish Act on aliens. In particular they must ensure that people arriving in Europe do not lose their dignity.	1.3783423080990118
Mr President, last week, in the Andalusian town of El Ejido, we saw scenes which were inappropriate to the European Union in the year 2000.	1.460444984085048
This was acknowledged by the Commission President, Romano Prodi, on 9 February when he confirmed that what had occurred in El Ejido went against the very principles of the European Union.	1.3471024892478658
These events have caused us great pain and shame and have awoken our fears given the extreme racism, xenophobia and intolerance demonstrated.	0.9386507958274342
It is incomprehensible that ways of coexisting and ensuring mutual respect cannot be found between two communities which are mutually beneficial.	0.945221153254273
The only way to prevent these events happening again, in a place where there are large communities of immigrant workers, is through social integration. This requires a firm economic, political and social commitment from the competent authorities.	1.4750096128210275
We are all immigrants.	1.0737677721079404
For generations human beings have not always remained within the borders of one nation state but have constantly migrated.	0.9336280288975101
Geographical mobility is not an invention of the twentieth century and neither are its economic and work-related causes.	1.0663681606331477
We are all immigrants, if not ourselves personally, then through one of our relations or ancestors.	1.6580085128313828
However, instead of producing these events which we are condemning, migration must generate social, cultural and economic enrichment.	1.3231614923999941
What happened in El Ejido is unfortunately not exclusive to this one town of the European Union.	0.9885526207140265
We must therefore firstly condemn clearly and emphatically the brutal racist and xenophobic outbursts of certain inhabitants of El Ejido against immigrant workers in the area. A whole community should not have been held responsible, criminalised and attacked for one regrettable but isolated incident.	1.217576207994563
Secondly, all the authorities must act immediately. Coordination between them is the key to combating this type of xenophobia and racism.	1.3775371248187125
In particular, local authorities and mayors have a direct responsibility to prevent any demonstration of racism or xenophobia, especially when this involves violent and aggressive acts against people and their property.	1.2645976444416622
These authorities must also help to achieve difficult agreements between the parties involved and must not hinder these, as has happened with the mayor in question.	1.2776702851909372
Thirdly, the political parties must assume direct responsibility for the political actions of their public officials. They must prevent any individual action or declaration which is contrary to the principles and values of coexistence and tolerance expressed by the European Union.	1.2319135064322404
Finally, the European Union must be responsible for monitoring the application of its principles.	1.4436407496396764
It must prevent any racist or xenophobic demonstrations in its territory and support and collaborate with national, regional and local authorities and non-governmental organisations and associations in the application of these principles. This must occur within a framework of constant action to combat racism and xenophobia and to encourage the integration of all immigrants resident in the EU.	1.1639018526111269
Mr President, initially our Group did not fully understand the need to table this motion for a resolution on events which seemed to be a local phenomenon.	1.2513893663318825
However, the incidents in El Ejido are a symptom of a phenomenon which is present throughout Europe and which deserves our full attention.	1.1982640130955766
We thought we had eradicated the terror of intolerance which racism had unleashed in Europe. Yet, over the years, social disintegration in Europe has been combining with an increase in migration from surrounding countries and increased awareness of human rights to develop into this climate of racism and intolerance.	1.2103427191400251
This is why what seemed to be a local and isolated phenomenon in El Ejido is actually a worrying symptom which is coinciding with the emergence of parties like Haider' s.	1.2100221028202858
This House therefore proposes the adoption of urgent measures encompassing all the relevant factors and to be applied immediately. We must ensure respect for human rights, tolerance and multiculturalism and we must obtain an increase in budgets and action lines for social and health issues.	1.1930945802798623
In this respect we must not forget that the original victim' s attacker was suffering from a mental illness for which he had been inadequately treated.	1.093345561157531
The current difficulties must also be taken into account so that this town can adopt the necessary measures, as indicated previously.	1.3272200482355054
Finally, as our Nobel Prize Winner, José Saramago, has said, we are all in each other and as Jesus Christ said, although Saramago disagreed with this, we should not just love one another, more importantly, we should respect one another.	1.5487732782641672
Mr President, Commissioner, Andalusia is one of the most tolerant and multiracial regions of the European Union.	1.040973426846792
Since time immemorial it has welcomed all those who have decided to move there and regarded them as Andalusians from day one, whether or not they were born in our region. Therefore, as an MEP, but primarily as an Andalusian, I can feel only sadness, repugnance and condemnation for the xenophobic and racist events which have occurred and which are foreign to this tolerant community.	1.2272653963145548
Yet a worrying situation is apparent.	0.6824576786583277
All decisions which are or are not taken and all agreements which are or are not negotiated by the Community institutions with regard to the economy of the principal sectors in disadvantaged areas like Andalusia may indirectly lead to these serious incidents. I am referring, for example, to the lack of agreement with Morocco and to the lack of solutions for the fishing industry, part of whose fleet is moored in Almería.	1.220304858589409
I am also referring to the erratic management of the import scheme for fruit and vegetables by the EU which is dominating relations between Almería and Morocco. I am also referring to the immigration policy of the regions, Member States and European Union which, due to actions or omissions, is leading to a few territories like Almería having to support this migratory pressure from north-west Africa on their own.	1.2727540469101872
All these factors have unfortunately been accumulating over time and are now allowing those who are cruel, intolerant, racist and destructive, of which all our countries have some examples, but thankfully a minority, to light the fuse of xenophobia.	1.2773822226621057
Anyone, whether European or not, who lives and works in Andalusia, is an Andalusian and deserves our consideration and respect. The EU can and must speak out.	1.4932683415467396
For you, the south is Andalusia but for us Andalusians it is Africa.	1.1506037082724798
We must therefore ensure that the EU provides every possible resource so that the economy of the south can prosper and enable a society to develop with more tolerance and respect for one another. This has not been achieved with the solutions proposed to date which have quite simply been based on looking the other way.	1.3836378173627664
Mr President, Commissioner, I speak from experience acquired during many visits to El Ejido over the years. I was therefore aware how the situation was developing.	1.3580820044029003
Here in the European Parliament, as in many other institutions, we have watched this situation with concern and were beside ourselves when we heard what had happened. This is because we felt the problem to be ours, as it was.	1.482068331689962
In El Ejido there is a serious social problem, problems of integration and employment and also a grave problem of public safety which acted as the detonator.	1.300333844041663
These events have also acted as a wake-up call to our consciences.	0.9207291559791547
Here in this House, in Spain and in many other countries, we have all fixed on El Ejido. Yet what we do and say here and the concern we express will really serve no purpose unless this leads to the adoption of a much more determined attitude to finding out what is really happening, not only in El Ejido, but in many other places where this type of problem may be occurring at any given moment.	1.3852961541514903
We all agree in our condemnation of intolerance and we also agree that we must look forward. We will not find the guilty parties in this House or in many other places.	1.4941199804936178
Those responsible for what happened in El Ejido are a minority who set out to satisfy their desire for vengeance on the immigrants. We must bear in mind that vengeance is not a solution.	1.1976845023673435
These problems can only be solved by close cooperation between all the authorities in order to achieve social integration and respect for all working there. This therefore requires a determined fight against illegal immigration and profound respect for the rights of immigrant workers who are legally working in El Ejido and throughout Europe.	1.2175944777464842
Mr President, this resolution expresses solidarity with the democratic forces in Spain fighting for human rights.	1.2384347576889423
All the Spanish democrats wounded by what is happening in their country have our full and complete support.	1.142326111122438
It was not only immigrants who were the victims of atrocities; the democratic system in Spain has been held up to ridicule, despite having demonstrated its tremendous capacity to evolve over the last 20 years.	1.193467026490795
Employers would be lost without immigrants.	0.7734834678058923
Working conditions are so hard and so deplorable that no Spaniard will accept them.	0.9106981099649258
Low wages, the lack of housing - some are living in cardboard huts - the lack of access to social services and the de facto system of apartheid are abominable and unacceptable and are not worthy of the respect which every human being deserves.	1.190661664114999
What happened at El Ejido is the result of inadmissible racist and xenophobic practices in Europe today.	0.9503499182986503
For four days, the immigrants were collectively hounded.	1.0103393999563828
Women and children were beaten.	0.7427870459650529
Fleeing from all quarters, hundreds of immigrants took refuge on a hill on the outskirts of the town.	0.8503039653010477
We are right to blacklist Haider' s Austria; but we cannot allow little local Haiders to practice policies of racial exclusion and merciless economic domination.	1.038635714141456
What happened in Spain could happen in any country in the Union if we are not careful.	1.3636503624807528
We all have a duty to put our own house in order.	0.6915286878161596
I support this proposal for a resolution, especially the points which refer to the application of Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty, and point 11 of this resolution establishing a link between the Structural Funds allocated and the fight against exclusion.	1.2679496457018866
It would be to our credit were the European Parliament to roundly condemn these events and support all proposals tabled in order to ensure that the rights of immigrants in Spain and throughout the Union are respected.	1.3786341765120618
Mr President, acts of racist and xenophobic violence are taking hold at the heart of Europe.	1.1536888060793102
Everywhere this violence is exacerbated by the spread of extremist movements.	0.7007358705533812
We must take practical steps today to put an end to all attacks of a physical nature.	1.0769924049401731
No European society can truly flourish when it harbours the risk of seeing one section of its population fall prey to the hatred of the other.	0.9779300085717795
Having received a delegation from the Austrian human rights association here yesterday and having seen what has happened in the province of Almería, it is easy to understand that we could easily have prevented this resurgence of racist hatred.	1.1770751914609283
These violent scenes at El Ejido are so similar to archive pictures of Alabama in the 1950s, when the KKK terrified the black population, that it is hard to tell them apart. They also put us in mind of Germany in the 1930s, when the Nazis were persecuting the Jews.	1.1844705351761458
Without wishing to lump everything together hysterically, because each period is different, we have failed to learn the lessons of history.	1.2484343876659072
That is my conclusion today.	0.9726412799304628
Because this witch hunt which broke out in the province of Almería should have been foreseen.	0.8527921761040991
It is the result, first and foremost, of the ghettoisation and exploitation of immigrant labour.	1.338370555570813
Three annual crops of Moroccan and African workers support 100 000 people and manage to bring in an annual turnover of nearly EUR 2 million; and yet 60% of them have no running water in a region where, as we know, the temperature may reach 40 degrees in summer.	1.2337780107880145
We also know that many of them only earn EUR 30 a month, while their fellow European citizens can earn three times that.	1.1017925089069744
This precarious wage-earning position weakens these immigrants and their families and makes them vulnerable.	0.8493751574178128
The irresponsibility of certain elected representatives and the barely disguised complicity of the authorities have contributed to this racist explosion.	0.9862029250835395
We should counter such acts of terror, Mr President, by setting up a parliamentary committee of inquiry as quickly as possible so that we can decide how we can succeed in preventing other conflicts of a similar nature elsewhere. My fellow Member, Mrs Roure, was right to remind us just now that we all need to put our own house in order.	1.3006055243528372
Finally, and I think this is important: why not have the honesty today to relay what was disclosed in a recent UN study explaining that, if Spain wishes to preserve its work, retirement and pension potential, it is no good just giving 30 000 immigrants a year legal status; it needs to be prepared to accept 12 million immigrants between now and the year 2050?	1.296522403555723
We must insist today as a matter of urgency on the right to education and the duty to remember, to recall the dates in history when our countries teetered on the brink of horror.	1.210010650623861
We need to educate our children on these matters and finally have the courage to recognise that we will need to be prepared to accept many more immigrants in years to come.	1.1448687405840103
It just remains for me to urge you all to attend the demonstration on Saturday.	0.9213652845742805
We must take to the streets of Europe to protest against these alliances with extremists which are a disgrace to Europe and which lead our youth astray.	1.1537187167428071
Mr President, since the signature of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Union has had responsibility for combating racism and xenophobia.	1.417741552271364
Two types of measure are required for this purpose. The first should seek the integration of people of non-European origin and the other should aim to organise immigration.	1.301628807100693
With regard to the first, the Commission has sent us a series of proposals, contained in two directives and an action plan, which aim to apply the following decision taken by the Heads of State and Government in Tampere. This states that 'The European Union must ensure fair treatment of third country nationals who reside legally on the territory of its Member States.	1.3786338973248213
A more vigorous integration policy should aim at granting them rights and obligations comparable to those of EU citizens' . This is totally contrary to what we have seen and found recently in El Ejido where there are irregularities, labour exploitation and indecent living conditions, which have been condemned in the past.	1.334554418405366
I hope for prompt implementation of the measures to achieve integration. I also hope that the governments which produced such wonderful words in Tampere, including Spain, will work diligently to apply these.	1.3927043549906502
I have less hope about the development of an effective and fair European policy in accordance with the statement made by the Council on immigration.	1.4262326894095403
The only proposal which has been made is for the directive on family reunification. This is a key issue, as we have seen recently in the media that there are many men on their own in El Ejido.	1.5089500347246494
Yet we do not know whether this has been accepted by the governments. Outside the Community arena, some governments are making efforts to renew their immigration policies.	1.3071180177168702
This is occurring in my country, despite the government, the party in power being the only one which does not like the new law on aliens.	1.360509331525206
The objective of combating racism and xenophobia, explained in the Treaties, should be the objective of all European institutions and politicians.	1.2931377988448887
On 28 February 1998 the European political parties, including the Spanish Popular Party, signed the Charter of European Political Parties for a Non-Racist Society.	1.2748881247325132
This requires coherent behaviour, yet local leaders of the Popular Party are throwing more fuel on the raging fire and boycotting the attempts of other institutions to put this out.	1.0142928558447093
The party to which the Mayor of El Ejido belongs should, according to the commitments signed in this Charter, act forcefully.	1.0236929567757478
It is only, as stated by Mr Hernández Mollar, through unity, responsibility and firmness that El Ejido, Spain and Europe will be able to overcome these events of which we are deeply ashamed.	1.3194923095562825
Mr President, one cannot but feel disgust and indignation at the scenes of lynching, no less, of Moroccan day labourers which took place in El Ejido.	1.2986552451627071
We do not the extent to which far-right commandos were to blame and how far the common people stupid enough to follow these commandos were to blame.	1.1294929522323114
We wish to assure these Moroccan workers that they have our full support - as if being exploited by unscrupulous employers were not enough, they have to suffer this type of aggression.	1.3012905970872468
And if the aggressors include working-class people, all we can say to them is that, in acting in this way, they are digging their own graves.	1.2599689011825568
In waging war against people who are as poor as they are, they are only doing their own exploiters a favour and preparing a future of oppression for themselves.	1.0931751450549978
But there are some who bear even more responsibility than the thugs who wielded the iron bars and knives: those who spread racist and xenophobic slander, those who indulge in anti-immigration demagoguery in Spain, Austria, France or elsewhere, sometimes even here in this House, are no better than those who take this stupid, reactionary demagoguery at face value.	1.1520931410192428
The lynch mob and their extreme right-wing mentors are the mortal enemies not only of the workers, but of society as a whole.	1.06576193038451
. I would like to begin by congratulating the honourable Member on the way in which he introduced this extremely important debate.	1.1703548342931196
I want to make it clear at the outset that the Commission unreservedly condemns the dreadful acts of violence at El Ejido against the immigrant workers of the region.	1.2390080617736148
We express our support for the families and friends of the victims.	1.0057338374350135
President Prodi and Commissioner Diamantopoulou have both issued separate statements.	0.8634153311409469
Naturally I completely endorse what they have said.	0.8299688755514935
It was especially moving to hear the remarks from Members of Parliament who come from the region about what has happened, uncharacteristically, in a part of Spain that I know reasonably well.	1.3235785767060515
Racist and xenophobic acts are wholly unacceptable within our Community, wherever they take place.	0.8766872618821437
They fly in the face of the very principles on which - as Mr Havel said yesterday - the European Union was founded: principles of liberty, democracy and respect for human rights.	1.2665592101115979
Of course progress has been made in recent years but we still have to work together towards a climate of tolerance in which racism and xenophobia are regarded as completely beyond the pale, completely unacceptable, while at the same time we deal very robustly with incidents such as the ones we are discussing this afternoon.	1.2602797279001654
We need, in our judgement, to focus on a package of measures including: first, the introduction of effective, anti-discrimination legislation at Union level; second, implementation of a common immigration policy with regard to the nationals of non-Member States to promote, in practical terms, the integration of the immigrant population in Member States' societies; third, the introduction of measures to combat social exclusion.	1.35785878177318
The European Union has already laid the basis for Community legislation on combating discrimination on the grounds of race.	1.3748457511912597
The insertion of Article 13, which was referred to during the debate, dealing with non-discrimination in the Treaty establishing the European Community, is one of the most significant changes of the last revision of the Treaties.	1.257752852428803
Since the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force the Commission has presented a package of proposals for the implementation of Article 13 including, in particular, a proposal for a directive on the application of the principle of equal treatment regardless of race or ethnic origin.	1.272264012372253
This proposal is under examination by the Council and the European Parliament.	1.2759009541644868
The Commission hopes very much that this stage will soon be complete.	0.8884003764754589
The conclusions of the Tampere special European Council, as Mr Hernandez Mollar said, clearly illustrated the will of the Heads of State and Government as regards the introduction of a common policy on immigration and the principles on which it should be based, with particular emphasis on the Union' s policy on the respect and promotion of the rights of migrants.	1.398930199373448
At Tampere the Heads of State and Government also emphasised the importance of approximating national legislation on conditions for admission and residence of third country nationals based on a shared assessment of the economic and demographic developments in the Member States as well as the situation in the countries of origin.	1.2019609628851151
The European Council also considered it important to step up the prevention of illegal immigration.	1.117911881948947
Its objective here is to secure the rights of victims of criminal networks organising illegal immigration, with particular reference to the rights of women and children.	1.1570623566637708
Those who organise illegal immigration should be prosecuted with the utmost vigour.	0.8104934861319394
The word that is used about them in Chinese society is 'snake-heads' . It seems to me a fitting description of them.	1.1662921497105734
Let me also draw attention to the work on drawing up a European Union charter on fundamental rights, which has now reached the drafting stage.	1.422557711705806
Those rights are, by definition, universal.	1.0506261320176824
The charter will extend to third country nationals in Member States even though certain rights will be reserved to nationals of Member States of the Union.	0.9256335965906993
The El Ejido incidents were shocking, as several Members have said in their speeches.	1.1785369262489407
But trying to take something positive from them, I hope they will spur us on to translate our aspirations about tolerance, fairness and freedom into real and effective policies that will help to transform the lives of all those families and individuals in the European Union who cry out for our understanding and our help and who deserve it, not at some indefinite moment in the future, but here today.	1.2875326316910138
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6737777542510281
The joint debate is closed.	0.43141497917890276
The vote will take place at 6 p.m.	0.6891275852876022
Human rights	-0.0
Mr President, before we start the debate on Kosovo or Mitrovica, I must inform you that a nasty sense of unease has come over me.	1.3377432306876338
Indeed, it is not the first time that we will be debating Kosovo here.	1.4654852397688385
We have adopted resolutions in the past but they usually are nothing but a warning shot, as nothing is actually done with them.	1.3010420622144634
I very much appreciate it that the Commission always attends.	1.2996890401756085
I certainly appreciate the fact that Commissioner Patten is present, given his powers.	1.299728302327374
But I - and many Members with me - also have to note that the Council is consistently absent from this debate.	1.4954695594367597
We need to cooperate with the Council too.	1.2322865894013162
I see that a diplomat from the Council is present who is diligently taking notes and who will then report to the Council but, for the rest, nothing will get done.	1.4494368004573595
I would insist on changing our procedures and on the fact that the Council should be present during the topical debate, so that we can enter into direct consultation with the Council.	1.1492148527816792
I think we should give this some thought.	1.1058959175186436
I would request you to pass this complaint on to the Bureau of Parliament.	0.9287714524972995
Mr President, Commissioner, we have not signed this compromise motion for a resolution for two reasons.	1.2827718482485655
First, because Mr Sakellariou, who is known for his openness and tolerance and whom I shall not quote, vehemently vetoed it in a bid to set himself up as your moral defender.	1.2901305484014032
I have no doubt, and I am sure that you have no doubt, that this is a major new contribution on his part to the fight against racism and intolerance.	1.3662871132122623
The other reason is that this text does not, unfortunately, go very far.	1.1728664090497203
I think that it manages, through a series of clever devices, to carefully avoid addressing the central issue, i.e. the final status of Kosovo.	1.260038218899261
I doubt that any of you still believe that Kosovo can one day become part of Yugoslavia.	1.0069667500891284
I also doubt that any of you can believe that Milosevic could resist for very long if the international community eventually resolved the question of the final status of Kosovo.	0.9425411177581682
I also doubt that any of you think that, as things stand, it is not in Milosevic' s interest to pull out all the stops and destabilise Kosovo, as he is doing and as we have seen.	1.4534620426891298
Finally, I do not think that any of you believe that the present status quo will bring minimum stability and hence minimum development to Kosovo.	1.2431498523870637
I also noted a mistake in the compromise motion for a resolution, which you no doubt overlooked.	1.1887550585309548
You condemn the first direct attack on the KFOR troops.	0.793665829984364
I would not want you to be birds of ill omen, but I fear that, by failing to confront the real issue, you will end up being just that and I shall hold you entirely responsible for what may happen.	1.4655373035641681
On the contrary, I think it is our duty to call on the Commission and the Council, which unfortunately is not present, to insist that the United Nations consider the question of the final status of Kosovo, of the multiplicity of micro-states in the region, of what happens post-Dayton and, finally, the question of real stability which can allow democracy to be built up in these countries and give the European Union a policy in this region.	1.4502654882925512
Finally, I would stress that we have been asking the Council and the Commission since July to take forceful action to secure the release of the 3 000 Kosovar prisoners and Mrs Brovina, Mr Jurti and Mr Hoti.	1.396493814808301
I note that the Union is preparing to lift certain sanctions and that we have not seen even one of these prisoners released in exchange.	1.4737725946780864
Why not?	-0.0
Mr President, what is happening in Mitrovica in Kosovo is appalling and reprehensible.	1.3703147058418266
Violence begets violence, and revenge begets revenge.	1.0225019398352526
The police forces which have been sent out do not have the manpower to stop what is going on.	1.1296152838197462
The Chief Commissioner of Police, Svend Frederiksen, has expressed his desperation at the fact that he constantly has to make do with less than half the manpower which was agreed.	1.1239539706970207
He has fewer than 2 000 officers, and it was agreed that there should be nearly 5 000.	1.2637292996899654
The police force should be large enough for it to be a visible presence, so that people can believe that it is in a position to stop atrocities. It should also be large enough to be able to clear up crimes and punish those who are guilty of them.	1.3171070898696622
Otherwise, there is a danger of people taking the law into their own hands. It is therefore also important that local officers should be trained, and the idea was, in fact, that 2 000 to 3 000 officers should be trained.	1.4189354546699855
However, there are still fewer than 200 trained police officers to contribute to clearing up crime. A year ago, we did of course see what happens when agreements and resolutions which have been made are not followed up.	1.4083196622820293
I was in Kosovo on 27 October 1998 when the Serbs withdrew.	1.0243403009945449
The agreement was that 1 800 OSCE observers should arrive to guarantee the peace.	0.9346276692401528
After a month, however, there was still only a handful of observers.	1.132907142698609
By Christmas, there were perhaps 100 and, by the spring, still only a fraction of the force it had been agreed should come was, in fact, in place.	1.443688362738687
Atrocities were not even being recorded.	0.7550668418607555
Then the war came, and the observers were withdrawn.	1.2815108741717578
I would therefore ask the Commissioner: can you not in fact do anything to stop us repeating our follies here in Europe?	1.245807668135535
Can you not guarantee increasing the police presence to 5 000 officers and training local officers, who would naturally find it easier to clear up crimes than would officers from abroad?	1.1042992625426016
I might also ask: when do you anticipate that they will be in place?	1.1561562521972917
And when is more responsibility to be transferred to local democratic authorities?	0.9460334203013876
I mention this last issue because it is the solution we should be embracing as quickly as possible if peace is to have any chance at all.	1.2755145347012184
All who are in contact with real life in Kosovo share the same opinion: it is a tragic, desperate situation where there is a democratic void and no possibility of the different ethnic groups living peacefully side by side. Mitrovica is a tragic example of this.	1.2890972349078218
Before military intervention by NATO, Milosevic' s policy for Kosovo was certainly to be condemned, and the demands of the non-violent forces of the Rugovo era for the Kosovar regions to be autonomous were justified.	1.2024728932882829
But NATO' s decision for military intervention and the KLA' s support for the armed forces had a devastating effect and have reduced Kosovo to a colony, as well as destroying civil infrastructures in Serbia.	1.0879681073130367
Today, Kosovo has no adequate strategy for protecting minority groups, and these include not only Serbs and Roma, but also moderate Albanians who still believe in the possibility of peaceful coexistence and are persecuted by the extremists in power.	1.2420184194943935
It is useless to talk of the Roma houses which have been burnt down and the thousands upon thousands of new refugees and the refugees from Krajina, who are now living, barricaded in, in Kosovo, abandoned by the UNHCR, which itself has been abandoned by the donors, while the emergency is still of dramatic proportions.	1.243953262496973
In the joint resolution, we ask the Council and the Member States to double their efforts to ensure respect for minority groups and to work towards the creation of democratic structures, giving a voice to all those forces which still believe in peaceful coexistence.	1.3416944329903109
In this sense, I am in agreement with Mr Sakellariou' s proposals.	1.3005474747753418
Another subject being discussed is the release of the Albanians held in prisons, particularly Flora Brovina, a woman of extraordinary humanity whom I met, together with the Women in Black of Belgrade, during joint attempts to build bridges between women from different ethnic groups.	1.1892099837895553
Flora defended herself, and asked Serbs and Albanians to shake hands.	1.0743150651758924
Flora Brovina' s husband is the guest of Serbian women in Belgrade.	0.7442650716138914
This is a sign of hope, the hope that it possible to act differently even in Serbia.	1.434415395387229
It is not true that Flora Brovina has been abandoned.	1.253584530454419
She might well have been abandoned by the large institutions, but we, who worked in Kosovo and Serbia for many years, are doing our utmost to campaign for her release.	1.4786264752019393
I believe that the European Union must do likewise.	1.5146584603372129
The embargo on Serbia must be lifted and Serbia must, in turn, release its political prisoners.	1.064629766199336
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to fully endorse Mrs Pack' s very emotionally-charged contribution.	0.9658559297332705
What she has said here is completely justified.	0.8606447835078486
There is not one truth in Kosovo, there are several.	1.4120042125997097
I refuse to accept that we can now talk about a genocide in reverse - that is bending the truth.	1.396048311228994
I completely concur with the draft resolution which is before us.	0.8745669898697441
We condemn all violence over there and that is what we need to do, but we cannot talk about genocide in reverse.	1.3211036975250279
Needless to say, the situation in Mitrovica is very dangerous and we all know why.	1.267055935006992
There are also important economic interests at stake and the whole tragedy surrounding the Trepca mines also plays its part.	1.049445097269469
We have already talked about the fate of the political prisoners.	1.172047897503535
There is a great deal of pain, a lot of suffering in Kosovo.	1.2615948342614003
The people are holding demonstrations, they are sending us e-mails.	1.0952832433298227
They ask us where their children are, their sons.	1.0975608522659035
We need to be able to go back with a proper answer.	1.1759642195202553
The case of Flora Brovina is just one of many.	0.9971241638561221
We are right to include this in the draft resolution, but there are hundreds, even thousands of Flora Brovinas out there.	1.3321385738542908
I would ask the Commission and the absent Council at long last to do something for these political prisoners.	1.3697139080509495
The fact that they are locked up in Serbia also fuels the unrest and violence in Kosovo.	1.0571026622336428
Mr President, in the present joint draft resolution, paragraph 10 urges the Council and Member States - rightly so - to double their efforts so as to make the necessary manpower and resources available for the UN police units.	1.5228895346079658
This request is fully in line with the vision held by the Special Representative of the UN in Kosovo, Mr Bernard Kouchner.	1.1509810471515431
In order to fulfil his mission to restore and maintain public order in Kosovo, he needs, by his own reckoning, at least 6 000 foreign police officers.	1.3201983574890563
The UN, however, have pledged to dispatch a police force of 4 800.	1.1258747512325638
To date, however, Mr Kouchner only has about 2 000 police troops at his disposal.	1.168911258394321
Moreover, half of this group is from the United States and Germany.	1.4991104641092363
It is logical that the Special Representative of the UN in Kosovo is extremely dissatisfied with this situation, especially in the light of the endemic ethnic violence in the region.	1.1153170818131355
What is disconcerting, however, is Mr Kouchner' s sharp criticism levelled at the French Government these days.	1.1070917183476912
Paris is leaving its fellow-countryman completely in the cold with a handful of policemen, not more than 37, in the crisis region.	1.2619358560273701
For this hardly honourable position, Mr Kouchner blames none other than the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Chevènement.	1.3454491326090257
According to Mr Kouchner, the Minister is said to have hindered the efforts of the French police officials on ideological grounds.	1.2597480123749303
I would ask the Council and the Commission to look into these serious allegations carefully and inform the European Parliament of the outcome.	1.3527734501620454
Press freedom in Angola	0.3160552155278532
Mr President, I do not intend to repeat the premise put forward earlier for fear of being accused of improper publicity.	1.0241562520423029
On the question of Angola, I think that we would achieve an initial result if we had a resolution at long last.	1.372598471950546
It would be the first in a long time.	1.2680632284357432
So I welcome it as such.	0.7500071844800884
I think that the European Union and the western world in general has had Mr Savimbi in their crossfire for some time now, with no discrimination whatsoever, but corruption is now so rife in Mr Dos Santos' s regime that even his long-standing friends are starting to find it hard to pretend not to see anything.	1.2130359182588597
So I think that we urgently need to get to the point where we can pass a general political resolution in which we can get to the heart of the matter, especially the worrying things which we are discussing, particularly logistics support for the information services by the United States and Great Britain, generalised corruption in the regime linked to multinational oil companies and numerous other extremely 'spicy' matters which we need to go into.	1.3899479490472988
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has rightly led the way in promoting human rights in the European Union.	1.2468215649338945
Clearly, governments are often more sensitive to the interests of realpolitik and to commercial, geostrategic or economic interests.	0.9972591753103872
We have established requirements for the countries which want to join our Union and we must also establish requirements for the countries which we support, because we believe in democracy and its values.	1.4313766954173823
A free press and informed public opinion are the heart and soul of a democracy.	0.8598585299746027
There can be no democracy without freedom of information and without free and informed public opinion.	0.904536711469334
Yet the latter cannot exist without free and unrestricted social communication which itself cannot exist when journalists are persecuted, detained, threatened or put under pressure.	0.8663461696687308
We rightfully condemned the behaviour of UNITA which threatened the peace process in Angola and we used our authority to invite the two sides to stop the war and embrace peace. Rightfully and with the full weight of our authority, we condemn the persecution and threats against journalists and we call on the Government of Angola to ensure the conditions of freedom which are essential to the vital work of journalists in a democratic country and society.	1.2458969920715344
Mr President, how much longer can we continue our cooperation with Angola?	1.3593666184404
Human rights are being violated consistently and have been for a long period of time, not only by UNITA, but also by the government itself.	1.4051525412022638
The legal proceedings against the journalists fly in the face of every legal principle.	0.9172034845470763
The Angolan Government must immediately authorise a substantial UN presence which can mediate and can report on human rights.	0.890658689806
Additionally, European observers will need to be admitted to the trials against the journalists.	1.1924483097134124
Europe, as a major donor, has so far remained too passive with regard to Angola.	1.431680578723486
If the Angolan Government continues to refuse to cooperate, measures will need to be taken.	1.0355495061733455
Without national reconciliation, reconciliation with Europe is not possible.	1.1014128737497775
This being the case, Angola will unfortunately remain a very rough diamond.	0.8287571552469071
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fully support the motion for a resolution being discussed by this House. The repression of both Angolan and foreign journalists in Angola is scandalous and so serious that we cannot let it pass without comment.	1.1804907563958946
However, this motion is inadequate as it actually starts from the principle that Angola enjoys rule of law and is only imposing certain restrictions on journalists and restraining them.	1.3384470285989476
Yet this is not the situation.	1.1376453595937523
Angola does not enjoy rule of law. It is a repressive dictatorship.	1.3340602224012967
It is at war, and a bloody war at that, which is dragging on and on.	1.5815996368592362
The prevalent theory that the enemy must be crushed and physically eliminated to achieve peace is not one which we can accept.	1.1726402277678682
The repeated appeals made by the Angolan church and, for example, by Mr Mandela and Mr Mbeki, for new negotiations to try and achieve peace must be supported by this House.	1.3114634946734987
As another Member said, we must have a general debate on Angola and not just on the situation of certain journalists suffering repression in this country.	1.3262521707232362
For example, I have today received information directly from Rafael Marques, whose situation we are discussing, according to which two correspondents from Portuguese television have been imprisoned in Angola.	1.2341526229447402
These cases keep occurring.	0.44096288514773035
Yet the worst part is that there is no way out of the situation in Angola.	1.2182695698587498
The silence of the major powers and our own silence are questionable and are benefiting a regime of corruption, violence and war.	1.0183242561454293
I must draw attention to the fact that the war in Angola is spreading to other parts of Africa.	1.1842086332105608
It is impacting on the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and on the situations in Namibia and Zambia. It is now also affecting the situation in Zimbabwe where Robert Mugabe has just lost the referendum precisely because he has sent troops to the Congo to prop up Laurent Kabila who is beyond salvation.	1.085066180694818
There are two sides in Angola or rather two armed groups.	1.0276662202079838
The first is the MPLA, which controls the oil profits. The second is the armed band of Mr Savimbi, which controls the diamond profits.	1.3554347763138237
It is oil and diamonds which are financing the continuation of the war which, as has been said, is terrible. It has displaced millions of people and caused them to go hungry.	1.398646140385097
It has led to a critical and tragic situation in Angola.	0.7176647880870445
This war must be stopped.	0.7033900988649128
The authority of this House could play an important part if we were to have a major debate on the Angolan situation and also on the whole of southern Africa.	1.5771231612970797
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the motion for a resolution before us today is important because of its subject and the desire to protect the rule of law and press freedom. It is also very important because of the broad consensus which has finally been reached after some heated discussions behind the scenes.	1.2610054326360687
The problem considered by the motion is a major one but, as has already been touched upon, could be regarded as minor in light of the even greater problem of the general situation in Angola which is experiencing a terrible humanitarian disaster.	1.2995889065519843
This situation, as in neighbouring former Zaire, is like a festering wound in which it is not clear who is infecting whom. As Mr Soares just said, a truly terrible situation is developing in Angola and in other countries in the region.	1.4933283189967494
This was appropriately described a few weeks ago as the First World War of Africa, given the involvement of certain countries in others.	1.1729779196562364
This is a major issue because the Angolan State and authorities must assume their responsibilities. The international community and the European Union must spell this out very clearly.	1.4453622216185669
These journalists are professionals who are trying to inform the public in their country and denounce the corruption existing in this regime, for which they are being persecuted.	1.2993417138993395
It is clear that such a scenario will never allow peace to be established in Angola.	1.2219704873538872
We have experienced this in our own national and European history. People can only enjoy lasting peace if they are living in a free and pluralist society where everyone is mutually tolerant.	1.2264495074779578
The cause of these journalists is therefore one which we must embrace, although bearing in mind that the problem goes much wider and much deeper and is much more terrible.	1.3259732865401863
Like a previous speaker, I also fully support the appeals which have been made.	1.4309229598941642
We must, some time soon, find the courage to tackle the whole Angolan problem more broadly and more vigorously.	1.0975325350384157
In recent years, the behaviour of UNITA has merited our reservations and criticisms but this cannot be used to excuse the Angolan State for having established a disastrous war economy with widespread corruption resulting in the continued suffering of its people.	1.0319529547439343
We must establish dialogue with other forces in Angola, be attentive to the appeals of the Angolan church and encourage the emergence of other national institutions, national reconciliation and new cultural and political forces not engaged in war. These can then eventually free this country and this people from the armed fate which they have been experiencing for decades.	1.1801598142839078
The people of Angola deserve better.	0.9376555907294645
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it seems as if the world is turned upside down.	1.1187228534644915
Journalists are sent to prison for simply speaking the truth, whilst soldiers who are supposedly fighting each other exchange smuggled goods in the bar in the evening.	0.9609462596015282
This is Angola' s reality.	0.6133111197905002
We are now expressing our horror concerning this war.	0.9709447832821171
Three million victims, two million driven from their homes within the country' s borders, hundreds of thousands driven away across its borders, including women and children.	1.0709556825734654
This is a war which transcends its borders. It is not just UNITA which is to blame.	1.5765146779269381
The government too is responsible for this continuing violence. This is why we insist that the journalists - more than 20 were imprisoned last year - keep speaking their minds.	1.2851450395224882
We would, at the same time, like to insist on other things.	1.023050233968889
We want the UN embargo, which is supposed to prevent a large proportion of arms and ammunition from being flown across to UNITA airports, to stop.	1.3621924170182065
But what do these sanctions mean?	0.716510536353834
It is the western world itself which is partly to blame.	1.1550720459650556
It is we, our own people, who keep the war going over there.	1.431406834550589
The so-called civilised world should hang its head in shame.	0.701948590768531
This is also the case for the so-called statutory government which is just as guilty, because if this journalist has accused the President himself of deriving benefit from this civil war, then all he is doing is voicing what the entire world knows already and which is being passed on to every tribal district across Africa.	1.2575564104014407
Mr President, we are partly to blame for this war.	1.3714017371770857
We should stop financing this regime and we should certainly stop supplying arms for the war.	1.0814961562845138
Mr President, the facts are well-known.	1.2858821277587733
On 24 December, the Angolan court sentenced a correspondent of the Portuguese paper, Expresso, to a year' s imprisonment and a fine of USD 20 000.	1.273470063623936
The journalist had brought to light a corruption scandal in the President' s cabinet.	0.8072556254395971
The trial took place behind closed doors and the defendant was only allowed one witness.	0.8146813236125172
Another journalist was threatened with his life during a parliamentary debate last month by a member of parliament of the MPLA government party.	1.0979388619358517
These are only two examples of a trend in Angola to silence any government critics.	0.8783756929926698
Over the past year, more than twenty journalists have been arrested for alleged slander or criminal offences against state security.	1.10173291717724
Their only crime was to criticise what human rights organisations have been denouncing all along, namely the large-scale corruption and disappearance of hundreds of millions of dollars, paid by the oil companies to the Angolan Government.	1.0616425133562197
Even the British Minister, Peter Hain, conceded this recently. We should ensure that the oil revenue is not used merely to finance the war or to line the pockets of prominent members of government, he told President Dos Santos last month.	1.152792827494914
But, at the same time, we note that Great Britain and also Portugal are continuing to channel military aid to the government.	1.079451125311098
There is indeed a great deal of hypocrisy regarding Angola.	1.022986856125631
On the basis of a report, the human rights organisation Global Witness concluded that the western world is turning a blind eye to the activities of Dos Santos because it is fishing for lucrative oil contracts.	1.1403280926554935
I would like to challenge Portugal to deliver proof to the contrary, by making commercial interests subservient to human rights, to which so much lip service is being paid.	1.408776494491634
In my opinion, Angola is a test case.	0.9302308467963442
We should, at any rate, judge the Portuguese Presidency on its actions and not on its words.	1.1501842196521221
Native Americans in the US - Dineh	0.8698520310746222
Mr President, the American leaders do not seem to have learnt a great deal from the criticism of how they treated the Indians and other indigenous peoples.	1.1595251016265489
We have to admit that our European sense of responsibility is no more developed in this respect.	1.3087848047878579
Once again, an indigenous people' s right of existence is being threatened.	1.1152870172208833
Once again, the individuality, dignity and health of a people are being sacrificed to the higher economic interest.	1.1040031158408936
Once again, we are losing a piece of our planet' s cultural and ecological heritage, despite the many treaties and resolutions on human rights, on the protection of minorities, rights of indigenous peoples, etc., which have already been ratified.	1.328220707415042
If tradition and culture have to make way for economic imperatives at all, we should at least give sufficient attention to the reception and reintegration of the peoples concerned.	1.3048592871747762
But if we are to believe the environmental movements, even this is vain hope.	1.333044684471972
There are hardly any reintegration programmes for people who have been relocated to the so-called New Lands.	0.8949291784937234
It very much remains to be seen whether these New Lands will be safe in terms of public health.	0.981589205477951
It is of key importance that the American authorities provide greater clarity regarding the way in which they are trying to offer these families a dignified alternative in keeping with a traditional way of life.	1.0488682660679514
It is also important that a debate is held where the long-term effects of mining in this region are discussed and weighed up in economic, ecological and social terms.	1.2290488115839016
The credibility of the industrialised north is at stake.	0.7088246472154672
Indeed, what right do we have to demand of developing countries that they give their minorities a voice, that they protect their valuable natural areas and that they respect human rights, if it transpires that we are unable to meet these demands in our own countries?	1.4912624964649188
Mr President, as Mr Van Hecke rightly pointed out, this is about human rights and about the rights of indigenous peoples, and Parliament must speak up, especially vis-à-vis good friends, and the United States is a good friend.	1.6143335747657694
This is about the repression of a minority which unfortunately goes back a long time.	1.0727406133124586
It is up to the European Parliament to protect vulnerable people.	1.2683019402010325
So we need to do this.	1.0990589295997684
This is also about respecting a culture, a language, a way of life and a people' s religion, a vulnerable culture which has nearly disappeared.	1.5215699525593214
It is important to point this out.	1.0457478904437858
This is why it is necessary - and Mr Van Hecke has already mentioned this, and this is also what we clearly ask for in our resolution - that the role of mining in this vulnerable desert area is reassessed.	1.4801581075682413
We have just approved the water directive here in Parliament.	1.1066237068957459
The water which these people need to exist is under threat because the groundwater strata there are being drilled by a mining company, and this is why the traditional way of life of the people who live there is being threatened.	1.1998867555703343
The forced relocation scheme must be stopped unconditionally.	0.7995884965694195
People should no longer be forced to move.	0.8908317332292247
Over the past 25 years, no less than 25 000 people have been forced to move and this must stop.	1.2955456550816355
If people need to move at all, they need to be given a viable alternative.	1.2665148385073115
This is not the case here.	1.1426798506138156
The area where the people in question are now being taken - and this is also the reason for this resolution - is a polluted area which is economically not suitable.	1.483326492938788
This is why I think that we as European Parliament need to ask the American authorities in any case to suspend the relocation scheme under discussion and, if necessary, abandon the scheme altogether.	1.3476288023106477
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is my maiden speech and I am delivering it with a great deal of pleasure and conviction as the topic is human rights.	1.2043212794873854
In terms of human rights, Europe has a very eventful past and this is why we have become to some extent the cradle of these human rights.	1.2797426036847983
We need to continue to stand up for these rights, especially in our own Member States and societies, but also elsewhere.	1.618586419782186
As Mr Sterckx said, we certainly need to do this vis-à-vis the United States which, after all, is close to us in terms of democratic values.	1.3987591214647337
The treatment of the Native Americans in many respects flies in the face of the most fundamental human rights.	1.1084903801662436
The account of the Dineh Indians is telling.	0.9128531278676351
With the discovery and, certainly, the exploitation of black gold - and, later on, uranium and oil - all possible means were used to remove these people from their land and to send them to regions with few prospects other than poverty, hardship and contamination.	1.2285058411625274
The area in Arizona which is to be the New Land for the Dineh Indians was hit in 1979 by the worst nuclear disaster in US history.	1.1344675317280142
It is now the intention to send the last 4 000 Dineh Indians to this land.	1.1274970583640451
The fight of these Indians is being backed by more than 250 NGOs and, thanks to the efforts of the Belgian 'Mother Earth' organisation, we are being kept informed of this situation.	1.1722428663567224
This too is characteristic of American society, which hears little about it.	1.149472501634168
They get het up about wars and genocide on other continents, but wrongly keep quiet about the genocide taking place in their own country.	1.0611888504510782
Today, the Dineh Indians are facing their final fight for their right to land, for their right to dignity and, above all, for their right to their way of life.	1.1443448423412421
There are few of them left and they are up against a very powerful, economic adversary.	1.1936267708868877
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I endorse the many comments which have been made by the previous speakers, but I would like to emphasise a few things.	1.3280129701109624
The Dineh people belong to the North-American Navajo Indians.	1.0149360436243802
They are facing expulsion and have been fighting a battle of survival for dozens of years.	0.8637104793912674
They have been living in harrowing living conditions for years.	0.8844198229073111
The deprived conditions in which they are living at the moment is forcing them to compromise against their better judgement under the financial and economic pressure exercised by the coal industries.	1.1665333036244716
The Relocation Act, which was introduced in 1974 and aims to re-distribute the land of the Navajo reservation, authorised the relocation of the peoples.	1.1900920829571031
This relocation is, of course, unacceptable because human rights are being violated in economic, social and cultural terms.	1.0713641167683463
The Dineh Indians are being moved like pawns and, in that way, lose not only their past and the land which is so extremely important to them - the land of their forefathers - but also any prospect of work and sources of income.	1.340372294883802
The Relocation Act was pushed through in Congress by a group representing the coal mining industry.	0.881391592467738
Congress never questioned where the people living in the area would have to move to or how relocation would impact on their lives.	1.2037902206445876
The population was not allowed any input.	0.6954313076872595
This resembles a kind of trade in human beings.	0.8866216816753287
The relocation scheme was implemented and the Dineh people were moved to an area contaminated by uranium.	0.9949346176229663
After the collapse of the dam in New Mexico in 1979, which resulted in the spill of 370 000 cubic metres of radioactive water and eleven hundred tonnes of pure uranium, this place is one of the world' s most contaminated areas.	1.1678594066372199
The United States administration, the coal industry and all of us need to acquit ourselves of our responsibility and provide a sound alternative: either the soil is cleaned or the Dineh Indians are allocated a proper place where provision is made for all kinds of support, be it in the psychological, social, cultural or budgetary field.	1.1509295052772022
It is high time we respected the rights of the Indians.	1.0610799995842077
This is why we ask you to vote for this resolution: we in Europe should not be intimidated by American interests which are being pushed by financial, religious and industrial groups.	1.3295767391185391
So let us contact the United States now!	0.986009664945932
Madam President, despite the protests by the international press, we still do not know the fate of Mr Andrey Babitsky, the courageous Russian journalist who has worked intensively to ensure free and independent information on the ordeal of the civilian population of Chechnya and the destruction of the city of Grozny.	1.3048730101450519
Among the contradictions in the accounts that have been given, there has also been an attempt to reassure international public opinion over Mr Babitsky' s fate, by confirming the theory that there was an exchange of prisoners with Chechen fighters which, inter alia, if this did actually take place, would constitute a breach of international law, which certainly does not provide for the involvement of civilians in such circumstances.	1.3077238230509012
Nevertheless, we now have more precise information: we know that the acting Russian President himself, Mr Vladimir Putin, asked Russian special services to safeguard Andrey Babitsky' s life and freedom.	1.2813767382786834
This is an admission that confirms all our concerns and makes Parliament' s position on the case all the more appropriate, as it calls for a concurrent explanation of other cases of journalists who have disappeared in the Chechen region during the conflict and the safeguarding of media coverage of a conflict that has reached unacceptable levels of violence.	1.2049780294593229
Moreover, we are asking the Russian authorities to provide immediate clarification of conditions in the so-called detention centres, and remind them that those responsible for any arbitrary detention, maltreatment or killing of civilians are laying themselves open to accusations of crimes against humanity.	1.1542620235925862
We would ask the Council and the Commission for clear and prompt action and a political initiative which does not overlook the issue of human rights.	1.1456137019494435
Mr President, in terms of human rights, there is of course a great deal amiss in Chechnya.	1.3965855410401782
We have received reports from human rights organisations saying that Russian soldiers killed and apparently even executed citizens - I am talking about old men and women - in Grozny.	1.297894539456023
Citizens are believed to have been burnt alive in air-raid shelters.	0.9273409101324817
We insist that these violations of human rights are investigated.	0.9718379057927801
Despite the pledges made, violations in, for example, Alfanyurt have still not been investigated.	1.0355574429683816
International government organisations and non-governmental organisations must be allowed access, and the Union' s general Council decided on 6 December 1999 to send representatives from the Member States to Ingushetia to study the humanitarian situation there. I am, to say the least, curious to know how they are getting on.	1.4563114090868186
The fate of Andrey Babitsky, the correspondent in Grozny of Radio Liberty, who was arrested by Russian troops, is a dramatic example of Russian policy.	1.227975175900027
It contravenes Article 3 of the Geneva Convention of 1949 and is a flagrant violation of the freedom of the press.	1.056167397213146
We want information from the Russian authorities as to Mr Babitsky' s whereabouts and his state of health.	0.8846384101998988
Mr President, a journalist is on a fact-finding mission and this calls for freedom.	1.2206075477732916
Yet he is taken hostage and treated as a prisoner of war.	0.7786367908937232
The war in Chechnya, like any war, is a trail of horrors.	1.369290268889545
The filtration camps are camps in which torture, rape and violations are perpetrated: we know that now.	0.9239063255037286
And just what is Mr CFSP doing?	0.8437700775149535
Russia is a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a full member of the Council of Europe and the OSCE, it has been invited to G7 and is a client of the IMF and the World Bank.	1.3596244663561117
What are we doing about it?	0.773565047674608
I do not understand why the power centres of Europe are keeping quiet, letting things pass and, by working with the Russians as if nothing were amiss, giving its support to the government which is waging this war.	1.3065194024684652
I beg you to intervene.	0.5775198627602637
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the tragic case of the courageous Russian journalist Andrey Babitsky illustrates once again the depth of the democratic crisis into which Russia has sunk.	0.9859864846121185
The entire Federation is allowing itself to be taken in by the war propaganda.	1.0963366081364079
A warlord has become President and he has even been described as a reformer in some western quarters.	0.9215852854686135
Journalists, on the other hand, who are simply going about their work in Russia, i.e. endeavouring to produce reports which are as objective as possible, are being treated like criminals.	1.2944268309024713
The Russian Government appears to have lost its fundamental understanding of what democracy is about and truth appears to have become a threat in its eyes.	1.0278205751751903
I can only reiterate my appeal to the Council and the Commission to stick to the rules.	1.236856438545149
It is simply not possible for a country to have normal economic relations with the EU if it does not recognise democratic principles.	1.1646601213797962
Mr President, what sort of government hands over one of its own citizens to people whom it itself describes as 'terrorists' and 'bandits' ?	1.2742682536747896
Without any hesitation, the Russian Minister for Internal Affairs, Vladimir Rushailo, earlier this week confirmed the answer to this revealing question.	1.059318699831602
The victim of this exchange is said to be the 35-year-old war correspondent of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Andrey Babitsky.	0.9377977270774002
I am using the phrase 'is said to be' on purpose, because official Chechen sources are still denying that they would have exchanged Mr Babitsky for a number of Russian prisoners of war.	1.0920026491229222
In the meantime, the highest Russian authorities are casting a veil of secrecy over the mysterious disappearance of this courageous journalist.	0.9884670204267829
For example, Acting President Vladimir Putin gave an assurance last Monday that he had ordered the country' s security services to bring the missing reporter back to Moscow safely.	1.0211661730769988
Russia' s new strong man, however, added a rather puzzling comment to this welcome declaration: 'As far as I am aware, Mr Babitsky already feels free.'	1.2213546627047347
This distressing ambiguity on the part of the Kremlin is not really surprising.	0.9869968836500022
The facts are clear.	0.6080168730679596
Andrey Babitsky was an unwanted busybody in Mr Putin' s 'anti-terrorist' operation in Chechnya.	0.8021709216402225
Hence his disappearance of over one month.	0.6289840955571228
In any case, the Babitsky affair warrants one conclusion: the leaders in Moscow cannot possibly maintain that hostage-taking and trading in defenceless citizens is a specifically Chechen crime.	0.9954923530140978
This resolution is already the fourth in a row within a short space of time in connection with the Chechen tragedy.	1.1244050023019683
Nor is it a mere luxury.	0.8219036687822774
Indeed, it is in line with some thirty Russian media bodies which yesterday distributed a special issue on Andrey Babitsky free of charge.	1.0814690732524495
Cambodia	-0.0
Mr President, Commissioner, it is because of my experience in the Balkans, when I was there on duty, that I call on you today to support the efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to bring those responsible for the genocide in Cambodia to trial before an independent court under the aegis of the United Nations.	1.2803204431210098
I do not think that reconciliation is possible after such murderous tragedies, unless those responsible for starting them are brought to trial and sentenced.	1.1025562899383343
Nor do I think that the people who were their victims can give them a fair trial.	1.308873292578035
I became convinced of this in Sarajevo when I had to negotiate the periodic exchanges of prisoners which accompanied each successive ceasefire agreement, none of which unfortunately lasted, between the parties to the conflict.	1.0496002288556976
Every time, just as the exchange was about to take place, we found men missing from the meticulously drawn up lists.	1.2201612316039168
Every time, when we asked why, the reply was the same, 'We cannot release him: he is a war criminal' .	1.4841324894064032
In the emotion, pain and fury of the agreements, it was impossible to break the vicious circle of blood and vengeance.	0.9732610463609406
If we want to help the Cambodians with the task of reconciliation on which they have embarked, we need to try and sentence those responsible at the highest level and thus exonerate the simple underlings and all those who were willingly or forcibly dragged along behind them.	1.1882343804586866
I expect Ta Mok and his main lieutenants to be tried and sentenced by the establishment of a tribunal whose impartiality is guaranteed by the United Nations.	1.0215494428454819
This will be the only way for the Cambodians to pardon those who simply followed them and to achieve lasting peace.	1.3264559949015138
Mr President, it became known this week that two prominent Cambodian opposition papers have been threatened with closure because they are reported to have insulted the king and prime minister.	1.102785086496003
These papers actively support the opposition politician, Mr Sam Rengie.	1.113206971986172
Legal proceedings have been initiated against Sam Rengie himself in order to lift his parliamentary immunity so that he can be brought to trial for treason.	1.0433648626948486
In his millennium speech, he dared to raise the fact that it should become clear what the procedure would be for appointing the successor to King Sihanouk in the event of his death.	1.3324715235475892
In March of last year, a member of Sam Rengie' s party was killed by a group of men in military uniform in the province of Kandal.	1.1944241102470368
In September, two members of the party were arrested because they were reported to have been involved in a rocket attack on the prime minister.	1.2351389238861026
This is notably the only party in Cambodia which has no military arm.	0.8765393605693134
In October, a member of parliament belonging to the same party was abducted by uniformed men and not released until the ransom was paid.	1.1262461756351658
The pattern of intimidation is clear.	0.5729167148982712
There is more going on in Cambodia: prisoners are being tortured, the army and police are involved in the trade in women and children, and people are held on remand to an excessive degree.	1.2454564116830271
All this is happening on a daily basis.	0.955981550694778
Even more serious is the government' s refusal to bring the leaders of the Khmer Rouge before an international tribunal.	0.9172431585075317
It is true, the civil war in Cambodia is over and political tension has eased.	1.1294441478067534
The way in which the political opposition is now being treated, however, gives us cause for great concern and, if it carries on like this, it is bound to impact on the Union' s relations with Cambodia.	1.393155898995923
Mr President, there is a new doctrine taking shape in international law, according to which no country can treat its citizens or the people living within its territory in any way it likes, and the sovereignty of the state can no longer prevent outside intervention when there are gross violations of human rights, not even when the government is legally or even democratically elected.	1.314230556959964
Living examples of this have been the Pinochet-Ugarten case, Kosovo and, in milder form in our own Union, the debate surrounding the government decision in Austria.	1.4710931047570008
This is what is at stake now in Cambodia unless the leaders of the previous oppressive regime are bought to justice.	1.16412683553068
At the same time, the struggle against impunity is under threat.	0.8716644893243545
The situation should also remind us all that the ratification of the Treaty for an International Criminal Court has been shamefully slow.	1.2230378641536017
. Mr President, we had an extremely useful debate on human rights yesterday.	1.2616836029556235
I am pleased that we have had this further opportunity to consider a number of areas in the world - Kosovo, Angola, Chechnya and Cambodia - where the protection of human rights has been a particularly severe challenge.	1.5166675520276605
First of all, on Kosovo, the Commission fully shares the concerns expressed in these draft resolutions as regards general policy towards Kosovo, as regards the continuing ethnic violence and as regards the prisoners in Serb jails.	1.4454717554126162
Our efforts in Kosovo, as elsewhere in the wider region, are directed at short and medium-term recovery and long-term stabilisation.	1.3301812569290394
In particular we support the development of a free, democratic and multi-ethnic society.	1.2548151544596726
Our assistance programmes in the fields of democratisation and human rights should continue to build confidence in general and, in particular, to try to build confidence between the various communities.	1.36887933852202
We have always condemned ethnic violence, no matter which ethnic group is the perpetrator or the victim.	1.131560959423216
We consider it is unacceptable against Serb and Roma minorities as it was against the Kosovar Albanians in the past.	1.1282414566189207
We support the efforts of UNMIK, KFOR and the OSCE to establish a functioning civil administration and to ensure law and order.	1.1599114589568016
In this regard we strongly support the High Representative' s recent appeal to Member States to provide more police officers for the UN civil police mission in Kosovo.	1.1431307529460641
It was a point raised by several speakers in the debate.	1.2994823936884563
I hope it will underline the importance, when we address the development of a Common Foreign and Security Policy, of looking at the non-military aspects of that policy as well as the military aspects.	1.3314749754327249
It is just as important to have headline goals for our policing and institution building as for a military capacity.	1.0622623791334103
We continue to be very concerned about the many civilians who are presently held in Serb prisons.	1.1261780324540742
I totally agree with the points put so passionately by the Mrs Pack, either before trial or following judgement.	1.0242763451800405
The plight of Kosovar Albanians who have been missing since the end of the war is particularly distressing.	1.2118155183639967
We call on everyone, within and outside Kosovo, to support these common aims, to support UNMIK and KFOR in their efforts to achieve them.	1.4699540826298
Turning briefly to Angola, we had again a number of knowledgeable speeches, especially from Mr Soares, with his unrivalled knowledge of the subject.	1.3777045817573041
The Commission believes strongly that press freedom and free speech will be crucial for progress with peace and reconciliation in Angola.	1.0737726952968651
It is a vital precondition for strengthening democratic institutions and civil society.	1.0641062101460077
An area of special concern is the harassment of journalists, including temporary detention of members of the so-called independent press.	1.126800269281649
The European Union made a specific démarche on press freedom to the Angolan Ministry of Justice in November last year.	1.205341732594754
We fully support the work of the UN through UNUA, given its specific responsibility to monitor the human rights situation in Angola.	1.2430399671959558
We are also committed to the Security Council' s sanctions against UNITA, including arms controls.	1.45650619113636
While maintaining emphasis on humanitarian needs, the Commission is preparing for a post-conflict phase in our financial support for Angola.	1.1779570270569613
An essential element will be support for democracy and human rights, including specific initiatives to strengthen democratic institutions and civil society.	1.0604714169076086
The European Union has condemned the use of anti-personnel landmines and we are supporting de-mining operations through an international NGO.	1.2800420781675212
The resolution I would love to have a debate on in Parliament one day is on demining, and particularly the importance of destroying the stocks of existing mines: stocks in the Ukraine, stocks in Moldova and stocks elsewhere.	1.1295695976460538
This is a subject which is not given sufficient attention.	1.4650781486295217
On the question of the indigenous peoples in the US, I am sure that the resolution which was primarily addressed to the US authorities will have been noted by them.	1.2674420643474884
Our general policy however, is to recognise the inherent dignity and the unique contribution of indigenous people to the development and plurality of society, something we are looking at particularly keenly in the context of the northern dimension which we are trying to develop and which we are discussing with North America.	1.376644915236996
The Commission shares the growing concern about the missing Russian journalist, Mr Babitsky and the conditions for the independent media in Chechnya more generally.	1.137140854532453
This issue comes on top of our deep worries about the plight of the civilian population in Chechnya, and I have heard Mr Posselt on this subject before.	1.3263021967725404
There are alarming reports of human rights violations.	0.724678190917409
Of course, there has been disproportionate use of force in the present conflict.	1.265383720930282
The Commission delegation in Moscow participated in a European Union Troika démarche on the eleventh of this month.	0.8989148960808396
We underlined our serious concerns about freedom of the press and freedom of speech and we pressed the Russians to clarify the circumstances of Mr Babitsky' s detention in view of their obligations in the field of human rights.	1.1067756115950478
We await a proper response from the Russians.	0.6540441635872878
In the meantime, the conclusions of the General Affairs Council earlier this week have confirmed the message which I have given today.	1.321277196459598
And we are ready to return to the issue at the EU-Russia Ministerial Troika in Lisbon on 2 March, if we need to do so.	1.4172414223660652
Finally, on Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge: we strongly agree that senior Khmer Rouge leaders should be accountable for their crimes.	1.2472461877180026
I totally agree with the arguments that were put forward by Mr Morillon.	1.0384059024311416
We vigorously supported the Troika démarche to Foreign Minister Hor Namhong on 4 February this year.	0.7196278193541017
The European Union underlined its full support for the efforts of the United Nations on the need for a tribunal to prosecute former Khmer Rouge leaders.	1.27992869727013
At the same time, we welcome the continued dialogue between the two parties.	1.1227779553157784
I am encouraged by the optimism of Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the UN, on the chances of agreement on the proposed tribunal.	1.1276055485620924
The Commission will continue to raise issues regarding the rule of law, democratic principles and human rights with Cambodian authorities through the EC-Cambodia Cooperation Agreement which entered into force on 1 November last year.	1.017575024893356
It has been useful to debate human rights twice in a couple of days.	0.9323421493879802
I hope we have other opportunities, but I hope we will have fewer examples of their abuse in the years ahead.	1.329163389193063
Thank you very much Commissioner Patten.	0.8949357156121014
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place at 6.00 p.m.	0.5569436679450354
Danube environmental disaster	-0.0
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:	0.5970435025992148
B5-0164/2000 by Mr Leinen on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists,	0.7872758984768483
B5-0167/2000 by Mr Maaten and Mrs Thors on behalf of the Group of the European Democrat and Reform Party,	0.9904106114345451
B5-0168/2000 by Mr Oostlander and Mrs Grossetête on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats,	0.864172930660293
B5-0173/2000 by Mr Papayannakis and Mr Sjöstedt on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left,	0.8921070651186468
B5-0179/2000 by Mrs Schroedter and others on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance	0.8453211244391792
on the environmental disaster caused by cyanide leaking from a Romanian goldmine into the Lepos, Somes, Tisza and Danube Rivers.	0.949300216255008
Mr President, we debated the framework directive on water this week, and the disaster in Romania has demonstrated once again how very seriously we need to take the protection of water.	1.5135886670297376
This disaster has raised a number of important issues which concern us as a European Union.	1.2498010172950975
We are delighted with the pledge that EU aid will be used to clean the rivers, and at least as important is the reinforcement of environmental awareness both in Romania and, more generally, in Central and Eastern Europe.	1.2655021199323224
We therefore welcome Commissioner Wallström' s brief visit, for it can contribute to this awareness.	1.2988253027404466
After all, this is a candidate country we are talking about, and this disaster is in addition to the existing concern about whether all candidate countries will comply with the EU environmental rules in time.	1.4531992550268238
The polluter ought to pay.	0.6157141134313001
I wonder whether the European Union can recoup this kind of cost from the environmental cowboys who appear in the so-called 'Wild East' , making use of the inadequate environmental legislation in place.	1.2697748456114664
I would be in favour of its doing so.	1.1019443035600713
Mr President, Commissioner, there has been one ecological disaster after another and, unfortunately, they are all similar.	1.2777817452684852
Once again, there is cause for concern at the serious pollution affecting the fourth most important wetland in Europe.	0.9823428798014148
The delta of the Danube is in danger.	1.0964447183268016
As in Spain in April 1998, as in Brittany and the Vendée since last December, once again an exceptional natural site is under serious threat.	1.2058937637631617
The European Parliament is constantly drawing attention in its resolutions to this sort of danger, which threatens our environment, upsets our ecosystem and again weakens our populations.	1.250272669806683
This new disaster raises the problem of the integration of the environmental acquis communautaire in candidate countries.	1.079148671069375
The authorities in these counties, which are still very frail from an environmental point of view, need to overcome numerous obstacles.	1.1657343226252892
First, they need to be able to prevent this type of discharge more efficiently by equipping the most critical industrial sites; then they need to have suitable technical means of curbing and containing this type of pollution and, finally, they need to be able to implement programmes to restore the most affected and the most sensitive sites.	1.281038608139409
Today, the banks and the waters of more than four rivers crossing four countries are polluted, which is why the European Union needs to concentrate its efforts and pressure on the urgent need for all candidate countries to come into line with Community environmental protection standards.	1.2709049054331218
But, over and above that, it is the technologies and the means used to prevent and deal quickly and efficiently with this type of disaster which are being called into question.	1.284333726624728
I hope that our future partners will demonstrate greater responsibility.	1.1376827756494863
The environment must be a priority area within the reunification of the European continent.	1.3895456603156653
It must form the basis for our partners' political will.	1.0446270702112763
Implementing high environmental standards will not only allow important industrial and technological sectors to develop, it will also have social and economic benefits and, at the same time, public health standards will improve.	1.3039027343808407
The efforts already being made need to be stepped up.	0.8987161145747184
The European continent needs to demonstrate solidarity and responsibilities must be clearly defined on the basis of the 'polluter pays' principle.	1.0283212116315241
Mr President, when the Doñana disaster occurred, the non-governmental organisation, the World Wide Fund for Nature, gave us a report on the number of reservoirs of this type in Europe.	1.4921121356833629
The number is huge. They are an ecological time bomb and affect the drinking water supply, ecological wealth and economic future of surrounding areas.	1.0529076814446854
I visited Doñana after the spill and saw how agriculture, fishing and the lives of people in the surrounding area were enormously compromised.	0.9469261258207925
I therefore believe that the European Union must, to start with, carry out an analysis of the situation of these reservoirs and compile a precise record of the number of these in Europe.	1.392340177844579
We must bring these reservoirs under Community law and the directives on waste and we must use the precautionary principle to ensure that this type of event does not happen again.	1.2139925846080248
If we do not, we will be permanently endangering the ecological wealth of our continent.	1.13879054739863
Mr President, this disaster at the mine in Romania affects a large hydrogeological area with rivers and watercourses in Romania, Hungary, Serbia and Bulgaria, The fact that 100 000 m3 of cyanide-poisoned water and large quantities of heavy metals have leaked out into the ecosystem is going to have appalling consequences for people in the area for a very long time to come, as well as for animal and plant life, agriculture, the tourist industry, biodiversity and the whole of the ecosystem.	1.23585235368814
It is incomprehensible that an accident of this kind could have happened at all today.	1.097404670995894
Is a substance as poisonous as cyanide really to be used in the mining industry and in the production of metals?	0.9666664919929677
The answer, of course, is an emphatic no.	1.2155735031706312
There must be no more manufacture or use of cyanide.	0.9864335270138305
I assume, therefore, that the EU will take the initiative and see to it that there is a total, worldwide ban on the manufacture and use of that substance.	1.3325654419539241
It has already been banned in most EU countries for a long time now.	1.1119931209653064
That an accident like this can happen at all is therefore an extremely shameful state of affairs.	1.0891661284703287
I have been informed that the Commissioner for the Environment, Margot Wallström, has travelled from Strasbourg to Romania in order to see for herself, on the spot, what has happened.	1.4562085293992284
My Group assumes that Margot Wallström will promise to provide aid to those communities which have been affected: economic aid, support in terms of environmental expertise and help in connection with the massive cleaning-up operation which is required.	1.1289230396846033
This highlights the need for something which we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have been demanding for an extremely long time, namely a rapid reaction force offering protection to civilians in the event of major environmental and industrial catastrophes of this type.	1.2066816032634256
It also sheds light upon the low level of environmental requirements in some of the applicant States.	1.0063343107001015
We must demand that there should be no exceptions which could jeopardise people' s health and the ecosystems.	1.0122658277721124
Mr President, I do not think we are in a position to throw stones at the Eastern European countries which have come knocking at the door of the European Union, because ecological disasters occur as much here, in the west, as they do in the east.	1.5243866715939196
For example, the overflow from the decanting basins at the gold mines in Salsigne, in France, have caused tremendous pollution and are a huge economic disaster even today.	1.1678562889572188
We know full well that pollution and restoration costs run into billions.	0.7103860233089925
Who is going to pay?	0.5969241531391573
Which is why the environmental aspect, which is becoming a matter of urgency, must be taken into account in all development projects at all costs.	1.3776026697888513
I too should like to ask the European Union to put its own house in order here, i.e. to call on Member States which still have gold mines to commission expert reports, so that we know just what the situation is.	1.3193838572747603
I am thinking in particular of the gold mines in French Guiana, where the workers, who are generally women, are exploited and work in absolutely deplorable health conditions.	1.2057772464630399
. Let me associate myself, not least as a former Environment Minister, completely and without any reservation whatsoever, with the expressions of concern by honourable Members.	1.2526738424638517
An objective assessment of the facts is not easy at this stage.	1.0653622349570886
But early reports suggest that the poisoning of the Lepos, Tisza, Somes and Danube Rivers is a very serious environmental tragedy.	1.0576238698588862
It has destroyed an entire ecosystem in a matter of days.	0.9133457492316551
No living organisms, from microbes to otters, have been spared.	1.214557552083941
Several Members have set out what seems to have happened.	1.0270698877487148
We have all seen some of the consequences on our television screens.	1.2111965406014187
Some environmental experts have put the environmental consequences of this disaster, at least so far as damage to the ecosystem is concerned, on a par with Chernobyl.	1.3970904041179895
It has affected the peoples of three countries - Romania, Hungary and Yugoslavia.	1.0865210665369325
It is the Tisza, Hungary' s second river, perhaps its most beautiful and most loved by its people, that has borne the brunt.	1.2956056754977365
As with all such disasters it is the long-term consequences that are the most pernicious.	1.3465464094125184
Some estimates suggest that it could take up to five years to restock the river.	1.0519154127275616
There is a continuing threat to other wildlife from eating toxic fish.	0.9339882153667585
We plainly have a responsibility to do everything we can, as rapidly as we can, to help cope with this catastrophe.	1.4696005048951197
That is certainly the view of my colleague, Commissioner Wallström, who I know would have wished to respond to this resolution in person today.	1.377580061713899
The reason she cannot do so is because, as some honourable Members have pointed out, she is in Hungary and Romania to see for herself the extent of the damage and how best we can help the Hungarian and Romanian authorities to tackle the crisis.	1.23309658693241
We stand ready to do so.	0.5156780127201374
We contacted the Romanian Government and the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River about the accident earlier this month to seek more information urgently.	1.1508258132615796
The Romanians have approached UNEF and OCHA, in Geneva, for an assessment of the damage in the Danube catchment area by an independent and international team of experts.	1.2860221809283565
We stand ready to assist in this assessment if there is a joint request from Hungary and Romania and if access to the sites for nationals of both countries can be guaranteed. That is obviously crucial.	1.2296008327728238
It is plainly essential to establish as rapidly as possible an accurate picture of the scope of the damage so that we can decide exactly how best to help tackle it.	1.1272855865234286
It is to that end that our efforts are now engaged.	1.3395091978578166
There is also a need to clarify the legal responsibilities of the mining company and of the Romanian authorities.	1.0091637234916173
This is an important point, as several speakers have suggested.	1.5104821983397227
The polluter-pays principle is a cornerstone of European Union environmental policy.	0.9552199321383095
It is mirrored in the International Convention for the Protection and Sustainable Use of the Danube River and it should be applied in this case.	1.4128022347715965
The European Union could not substitute itself for the mining company for any compensation payments due.	1.1047846084902442
The Union has mobilised some EUR 20 million over the past seven years to support protection of the Danube River basin.	1.186775798656209
In the context of pre-accession aid to the region it may be possible to redirect some of the assistance we are giving under ISPAR and PHARE to tackle the most severe impact of this accident, as long as the polluter-pays principle is fully respected.	1.2145266283188678
We will want, in the longer term, to see what lessons can be drawn from this disaster, above all to see how to prevent such disasters happening in the first place.	1.41014913586675
The incident reinforces the case for a strengthening of European civil protection, along the lines suggested by President Prodi in his recent speech and as suggested by one or two Members today.	1.0806071101157502
But for now the priority is to cope with this crisis.	0.9095431713038239
As I have said, my colleague, Commissioner Wallström, is on the spot today.	1.253221848198009
She will want to keep Parliament closely in touch with the action she proposes as a result of her visit.	1.0780540159167307
This has been an appalling tragedy for Europe and Europe has to respond and do all it can to ensure that incidents as dreadful as this do not continue to blight our future.	1.0643156093986248
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
We shall now proceed to the vote.	0.16783221255831815
VOTE	-0.0
.	-0.0
(FR) The only reason we voted for the PSE-Verts/ALE-GUE/NGL compromise motion for a resolution is because this resolution allowed us to condemn the decision by the Goodyear-Dunlop management to close its factory in Italy.	1.0936478029816157
However, the measures set out in this resolution are derisory in terms of combating the policy of the major industrial groups which are shedding jobs and exacerbating unemployment.	1.3983900903992434
Moreover, it is all just words, because the Socialist governments, which are now in a majority in Europe, are just as incapable of taking action to prevent redundancies as right-wing governments.	1.5294262303459933
The real problem is not finding a legal way of slightly complicating redundancy procedures, but banning them.	1.166062162119903
The only way of stopping the diabolical machine which produces capital gains on the one side and unemployment on the other is to ban redundancies in all large companies which are in profit, on pain of compulsory purchase, and to publish the accounts of large companies and subject them to the scrutiny of the workers and the general public.	1.418022534072322
Society must have the means of enforcing its own agenda on large companies and their owners. The first item on that agenda is the eradication of unemployment.	1.2915471520617317
The sums needed to create useful jobs in public services and finance the distribution of work among everyone, without cutting wages, must be taken from the profits of large companies.	1.1200871556773142
It is far more important for the majority of society than the waste involved in financial operations or the scandalous enrichment of a minority of large shareholders.	1.1818494007668032
. (SV) I cannot support the present resolution because, in paragraph 8, an individual factory in Italy is singled out with the express wish that precisely this establishment should remain in place, while the current management is being advised to try to sell the factory to a European tyre manufacturer.	1.3555234153833409
It is not the European Parliament' s business to express an opinion on which factories in the European Union' s 15 Member States are to remain in place and which are to be shut down; to expand their work forces or reduce them; stay in the same location or else move; be sold or not be sold; and, in the case of those which are to be sold, to comment on whether they are to be sold to companies within or outside Europe.	1.335391953743371
Ultimately, it is a question of different spheres of authority, where the European Parliament and its Members do not have any legal means of changing the current corporate decision or do not even have a particularly deep knowledge of the situation in the factory as it stands.	1.3036299449911009
The Swedish Christian Democrats would emphasise the value of the European Union' s and the European Parliament' s concentrating on their basic tasks and not undermining the value of their actions in these areas by also acting in areas outside their jurisdiction.	1.154891976739041
Tourism and employment	-0.0
The next item is the report (A5­0030/2000) by Mr Viceconte, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission: 'Enhancing tourism' s potential for employment - follow-up to the conclusions and recommendations of the High Level Group on Tourism and Employment' [COM(1999)0205 - C5-0112/1999 - 1999/2115(COS)].	0.9643790806134912

(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the European Union' s delay and indecision with regard to the introduction of a fully-fledged Community policy on tourism, increasing attention is being paid to tourism as a sector capable of generating new jobs.	1.2461051828197638
One of the reasons for the Community' s interest is the structural flexibility of this sector of the employment market, which explains its attractiveness for women and young people, to whom it often offers their first experience of employment.	1.3443426896118817
The importance of the tourist industry and its impact on employment - although everyone is now aware of this - is nevertheless based more on personal experience rather than on verifiable statistical data.	1.2314701942354738
The fact that, due to the absence of sufficiently reliable and scientific statistical data, the tourist industry is in effect an unknown quantity has greatly limited the prospects of pursuing a consistent policy in this area and creating employment on a wider scale.	1.0785800595058792
It would be appropriate, therefore, to begin by summarising the impact of tourism on the lives of Union citizens and the desirability, in both economic and social terms, of promoting the European tourist industry.	1.3810606896301767
Firstly, I would remind you that the tourist industry is one of the infrastructures which any advanced society must have. Without it, institutions, business and the world of work could not function.	1.3262532332485741
Tourism must therefore be thought of as the whole range of goods and services required by individuals moving from their habitual place of residence and thus confers mobility, the characteristic feature of contemporary society.	1.0973076452923363
The term 'tourism' must no longer be solely perceived as synonymous with sun, sea and holidays, which has the effect of reducing the interest taken in the subject at institutional level.	1.149711835404567
Secondly, I would like to explode a myth, taking as a starting point an apparent paradox, which is clearly highlighted by Eurostat figures: the main international tourist countries are not those traditionally regarded as tourist destinations, but on the contrary the most advanced nations, whose quality of life is one of their main attractions and most heavily promoted features.	1.3258700214471137
