Clearly, the importance of tourism for the economy of regions traditionally regarded as tourist destinations, southern regions for example, is very different, and should be studied carefully.	1.4052563102418612
It is an obvious truth, and one that is measurable by other economic and social indicators, that thanks to tourism, many Mediterranean regions have undergone a radical change for the better in their economic and social system and the way of life of their inhabitants, and achieved a drastic reduction in the numbers emigrating.	1.4857760822011898
Social growth has occurred only in those areas where the tourist market has given rise to the development of all the activities required to meet the needs of visiting tourists, thus creating an entire productive system.	1.114055414060094
In such cases, there is a measurable increase in employment as a result of the growth in tourist numbers, thus establishing a virtuous circle of growth in the local economy.	1.1872683297060225
This reminds us that tourism cannot be regarded as the poor countries' petroleum industry, because it requires huge investment in structures, infrastructures, entrepreneurship, professional expertise, social services and training; that the tourist industry is essential for the equilibrium of many regions as it provides a direct source of employment and a market for all local productive activities: agriculture, small firms in the industrial and craft sector, transport, services, retail sector, training, etc; that the development of the Community' s tourist industry is closely linked to its sustainability with regard to the Community objectives; that the varied geography and historical, cultural and environmental heritage must be protected and exploited.	1.2670328810135958
In my opinion, the European Union can, in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity, supplement the action of the Member States and contribute to consolidating the potential of tourism by means of certain measures, such as the adoption of a specific legal basis for tourism policy in the Treaties; the adoption of mechanisms within the programmes and projects set up under its regional policies and other policies of the Union, with a view to promoting tourism in all its forms: rural, environmental, cultural, conference-based, spa-related and sports-related tourism, and also tourism focusing on senior citizens, research and training; the amendment of Directive 95/57/EC on the collection of statistical information in the field of tourism; the cofinancing of projects to set up new transport services and infrastructures; the cofinancing of pilot schemes involving benchmarking and the exchange of experiences.	1.2528637309857198
These and other specific measures included in my report can, in my view, lend added value to the actions that the competent national and regional authorities should foster, in order to promote tourism and create new jobs, starting with the adoption of positive fiscal measures to assist small and medium-sized firms, particularly by reducing the burden of charges on labour.	1.2398223174343823
Mr President, Commissioner, before I explain to you the position of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, I would like to share with you three basic factors which, in my opinion, determine the present and future of European tourism in an international environment.	1.1847267075811667
In Europe today, the tourism market contributes 5.5% of the gross national product and occupies a rather significant proportion of the workforce, approximately 6%.	1.1709423897939868
Those figures are incomparably higher for some countries.	0.7187908224023027
To grasp the importance of tourism for some parts of Europe, it is worth pointing out that in my own country, Greece, a country that attracts tourists, over the past four decades, during which the farming population has clearly aged and the population is over-concentrated in the major urban centres, the only areas which have retained populations of low average age or to which young people have returned are ones where tourism has developed.	1.2618300534695484
It is therefore clear that besides being a matter of general economic interest for Europe, tourism is a priority for the economic and social participation of the European Union' s regions.	1.3234325230380104
Another factor is that the world market is growing explosively.	1.2294437736913837
The forecast is for ten billion tourists in 2010, but unfortunately for Europe there is a reverse trend.	1.1954176969739594
Europe' s share of the increase is falling drastically each year to the benefit of Asia, the Far East and America.	0.9840653531679017
You see, the world tourism market is influenced every day and directly by the liberalisation of transport, its reduced cost, and competition from new centres of tourism outside Europe.	1.325456503150444
Furthermore, 90% of businesses active in tourism are small or medium-sized, the very enterprises which form the living cells of our social and economic tissue, which are called upon to tackle the new obstacles and respond positively to the challenges of this global development.	1.3247042221022463
As the rapporteur said, this becomes particularly important when tourism is appreciated as a unitary productive system because of its ability to absorb large quantities of agricultural and industrial products, services and transport and to create a significant amount of added value.	1.135172117101274
Here, then, I want to point out that international competition is tough and, if we are to overcome it positively, we must together envision and share a long-term strategy.	1.3979141691829815
We must take very serious note of the need to upgrade the human resources engaged in tourism, so that tourism will be able to respond to the new technological challenges of our age.	1.2659228842749437
Today, nobody can ignore the fact that new digital technologies and systems, with Internet at the sharp end, mobile telephones and digital television, are bringing about radical changes in tourism as a whole and its respective structures and operational models.	1.2149905296619243
The introduction of these new technologies is not a threat, but a new opportunity for our tourism because it offers the potential to provide new and innovative tourism products and services, which our tourism needs for an ever-lengthening tourism season, so that it can attract new customers and offer new and alternative forms of tourism.	1.2960884104870507
The new technologies also make it possible to open new markets in traditionally undervalued, non tourist areas, which could develop to become centres of tourism and attract substantial investments.	1.2512297030533384
To this new labour market there must be a response in the programmes of tourism schools and training programmes for company staff, including programmes for training the unemployed and their re-introduction to work.	1.1927812341336417
The Committee on Women' s Rights paid particular attention to the issue of education, because according to official figures women account for 53% of those engaged in tourism services, and in parallel, they form a majority among the working people most easily affected by social and economic change.	1.3477451081617493
We must not forget that people working in tourism, especially women, encounter particular problems such as seasonal work, the need to renew contracts from one year to the next, social protection, lack of interest in continuing education, and reduced possibilities for development.	1.333107987829414
We therefore ask the European Commission for special measures and to adopt the principle of equal opportunities in all tourism programmes and programmes for company development.	1.381765107837289
Mr President, I would like to begin with some words of optimism, which came to us in the form of the High-Level Group communication of October 1998, the first page of which said that by the end of the next decade, it would be possible to create between 2 200 000 e 3 300 000 new jobs in tourism activities in the Union.	1.3568842449046505
In addition, it said that this would only happen if the right conditions were created.	1.4657311157662274
The Commission and Parliament are called upon to answer two questions: what are the right conditions and what is the role of the European Union on this?	1.3599033532868843
The Commission and Parliament can help us understand, in the first place, exactly what we are dealing with, because even the term 'tourism' , as was, moreover, pointed out in the Viceconte report, is still an ambiguous term, a kind of variable that depends on latitude, climate, a range of opportunities, and a series of background factors; it can be synonymous with holidays or it can be a true area of production, income, wealth and employment.	1.4109241257765148
There is a shortage of facts: we have no information on the economic impact, which still remains a complete mystery.	1.4784573240057002
We have criteria for the gathering and interpretation of statistics which are totally at odds with each other, despite what was said in a 1995 directive by the Commission and Parliament.	1.1856475858623927
With the aim of working out a strategy, it is vital to have a reading of these facts which harmonious and as strict as possible, so that we truly make tourism capable of creating jobs.	1.133792803186823
This does not follow automatically: often in the past a great deal of wealth has been accumulated thanks to the promotion of the tourist industry, without this being matched by an increase in employment.	1.2040822179476243
There is no legal basis, and we feel that this is currently the major obstacle to any intervention in the tourism sector.	1.3851780470977237
A legal basis translates into the ability to formulate strategies, to coordinate and to programme, all vital factors for making European Union tourism competitive with other markets.	1.2118274483741494
A legal basis would mean we would avoid having to draw on the Structural Funds, as was the case in the past, to obtain some loose change.	1.189728229946282
Moreover, only minimal amounts were made available to us: we should bear in mind that the Commission communication indicated amounts totalling EUR 4 700 000 000 over the last five years, which corresponds to the cost of building 400 kilometres of motorway.	1.3651191469957986
There is no opportunity to send a strong message to the Member States: recognising the legal basis of tourism would allow the States to acknowledge one of the European Union' s competences which at the moment, is only exercised in fits and starts.	1.386447566527128
We fully endorse the Community measures which were recommended in the Commission communication: advantageous taxation, that is, fiscal measures that offer conditions that are truly competitive in this market to the production sector - 95% of which, I would point out, is made up of small and medium-sized businesses, which is equivalent to 2 million small and medium-sized businesses in the European tourism sector; it awards special attention to vocational qualifications in the European Union, and therefore to investing in training; finally, it undertakes to make the job market transparent.	1.3689766660645886
The tourism market is by definition a flexible market; we do not want this flexibility to be seen in a solely negative light, with seasonal work being misinterpreted as illegal work: remember that 50% of employment, especially in southern countries of the European Union, is done on the black economy.	1.334288668724423
We feel that the European Union and the Commission needs to make a strong commitment to sustainable tourism, which means having a strategy that is compatible with the environment, after the excesses of recent years when private wealth often did not correspond to high levels of employment.	1.3154720299077463
First and foremost, we need to compete in terms of quality.	1.1940415866344025
Finally, we consider that tourism can, in addition to being a growth factor, be a factor for democracy, and in this regard we are asking the Commission for a clear, conscious commitment.	1.6182010294368923
Mr President, there are three points I wish to address.	1.5265947497008623
The first is the inclusion of a legal base in the Treaty.	1.3877494059229991
This is something I favour, but currently as part of a minority in my own Group.	1.5943838107138455
We are all fully conscious of the importance of tourism, both to local economies and as a factor of European integration.	1.3631838743054139
The problem for some of us, however, is the lack of specification of the extent of the legal base and of just how it would relate to considerations of subsidiarity.	1.2004302884250022
Second, there are similar issues related to the establishment of a multiannual programme for tourism.	1.2268803180282926
The resolution contains many excellent ideas for the promotion of different types of tourism and for its increasing professionalism.	0.9583683840258658
At the same time the Commission is currently concerned about confining itself to core tasks.	1.3138509358909112
The question has to be asked whether some of the activities suggested in the resolution might not put more pressure on its resources than is desirable.	1.2641962437093923
Third, there are several references in the resolution to permanent employment.	1.3641239159276923
Of course the promotion of this is desirable and permanent employment need not necessarily mean full-time employment.	1.1980434013848495
But there will always be people who are looking for seasonal employment.	1.0781886605223898
Students are an obvious example.	0.6513511257752677
We have some concern that the resolution does not give enough consideration to them and to ways in which their interests could receive specific protection.	1.1800349140319442
Thus, while complimenting Mr Viceconte on his report and finding a great deal in the resolution to commend, we shall be asking for a number of split votes to allow these concerns to be addressed.	1.3880308078574508
Mr President, I too believe that tourism has a very important role to play, not just in our European regions, but throughout the world, because it is a great asset when it comes to economic and social development.	1.56846172270663
But it is also a very vulnerable sector, as we recently saw with the oil slick.	1.4181743769871396
A flourishing tourist sector can be totally wiped out by an ecological disaster such as an oil slick.	0.91708141632881
When it comes to tourism, we can no longer do what we like where we like.	1.398049329084492
There are huge reserves; certain zones, rural zones, so-called zones lagging behind but which still have unspoilt nature and untouched natural habitats, are listed as having good potential for what we call eco-tourism or green tourism.	1.1535420717428413
This could be developed and provide a large number of new jobs.	1.0913717242201961
But these regions need to take real account of positive and negative experiences in other tourist sectors.	1.037552270856513
We must not kill the goose that lays the golden egg of tourism.	0.8748106724903811
Tourism must be environmentally friendly if it is to continue to be an asset in the future.	1.2460868781043444
I can think of many mountain regions which are continually spoilt in order to develop a tourist sector.	1.028994254510176
We have stopped counting the damage and destruction in natural habitats and mountain zones.	0.8757041120124449
I should also like to refer to the darker side of tourism, the tourism exported from the Member States of the European Union. I am referring to sex tourism.	1.2917145535537586
I know that action is being taken against this so-called tourism elsewhere, but we must remember the European Union' s responsibility at this level.	1.5415774901016623
Under no circumstances can we, as responsible politicians, allow what is currently happening to continue, with young girls practically bought in the countries of the East and coming here to be abused on the cheap.	1.2209446052797166
Finally, I should like to refer to the tourism which gives citizens contact with the outside world and democracy.	1.1232901467146612
I am thinking in particular of countries such as Cuba which are isolated but I know, because I have travelled there extensively, that the Cubans who come into contact with tourists can learn something of the outside world, obtain different information and pass on different information.	1.1921075121708726
For all these reasons, I think that reforming the Treaties would allow the huge tourist question, which is an important asset for the whole planet, to be properly integrated.	1.4928395486619825
Mr President, during the most recent meeting of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I was pleasantly surprised.	1.233402039079808
The opinion of Mr Sánchez García, addressed to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, contained a remark regarding the IGC.	1.0495358072678782
The draftsman of the opinion held the view that there was no need for a legal foundation for tourism in the Treaty.	1.30285092852993
This was in contrast to the majority opinion held in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.	0.988587576908832
Having heard many Members who share the view expressed in the opinion, this was a real relief.	1.495408500223082
Unfortunately, his text has not survived the vote.	1.1790358473393596
It does, however, support my view that I am not, apparently, the only one who cannot agree with the majority opinion.	1.5764776224444552
This brings me to the content of the report.	0.7141490943012156
An important aspect of the tourism industry is employment and potential employment.	0.9990574364119575
Especially in the southern Member States, the tourist industry is a major source of income.	1.2793691622539949
From this vantage point, there is every reason for the government to formulate stimulating measures and a stimulating policy.	1.2482463120588718
The seasonal nature of tourism and the employment fluctuations that this entails also deserve attention.	1.0239628898102078
I am surprised, however, at the fact that many want to achieve this by means of Community policy.	1.4089224603383956
This is not desirable, either from the point of view of tourism itself or the stimulation of employment.	1.228030366060142
The discrepancies between the different regions can often be traced back to cultural or historical factors.	0.8832669097195454
Within these regions, a huge range of problems have their part to play.	1.2640897689589203
It is obvious that mainly local and regional - and, therefore, to a lesser extent national - authorities are best placed to assess the situation and draft appropriate policy.	1.2221105399833398
For this reason, I cannot therefore endorse the transfer of powers to European level.	1.3353830737972858
In addition, employment policy in general is also a factor.	1.5666535597422688
Here too, the structure of the economy differs for each Member State, and the ways in which the current status has been achieved are diverse.	1.3416504122736679
It will not do for one type of policy, probably with many exceptions and adaptations, to be applied.	1.351020298920212
This would mean that the EU would unjustly be removing tasks from Member States and that the Brussels bureaucracy would be intervening unnecessarily.	1.153006204179977
It is preferable for Member States to take measures to stimulate employment themselves.	1.0176048990604016
Their expertise, is, of course, superior to that of the Commission.	1.1060676366020654
This is why I am very hesitant when it comes to formulating Community measures to promote employment.	1.4510418419292048
Even in the tourism industry.	1.1212447303720723
It would really be a nuisance if Parliament were to attempt to achieve this unofficially by extending its powers.	0.9569258914564219
Mr President, you will understand that we cannot assent to the present resolution as it stands.	1.4857325628406495
First of all I should like to thank Mr Viceconte for all the work that he has done on this report.	1.320034730232542
It is a very extensive report.	1.3124111568384809
We greatly welcome it, just as we welcomed the original report that it was based on, the report of the high-level working group which was set up by the European Commission.	1.3436880641085949
I hope that the Commission will not forget that.	1.4038117957067597
Having set it up, I hope the Commission actually makes use of it and therefore does not just allow it to sit around in the corridors and gather dust.	1.2970254480060617
Tourism is basically small businesses and therefore a very fertile area for job creation.	0.9440436576564518
As has already been said in this debate, three million potential new jobs within the next ten years is something well worth going for.	1.1350423305098458
Europe can no longer refuse to give the recognition - both political and in terms of policy-making - that the fastest growing sector of its economy deserves because of its economic and social position.	1.2865806115110379
We need a more dynamic vision based on tourism' s contribution to job creation.	1.0971712552157828
We must recognise a sector that is predominantly engaged in cross-border activity and therefore deserves a European policy with a stimulating, innovative and proactive approach to sustainable business development.	1.0621489386872778
I know the Commissioner is very keen on information technology.	1.1567111725068608
He has convinced me of that.	0.6008803482820485
But his portfolio of information technology and tourism actually go very well together.	0.9181220096734546
There are several reasons why the tourism industry is an ideal test-bed, therefore, for integrating job creation strategies.	1.2087886083310777
Let us look at some of these reasons.	1.1039934140114616
The importance to the economy of tourism and its growth potential is obviously one.	1.2211437564078236
Various sectors of the population are employed by the tourism industry, particularly the more vulnerable groups, such as young people, women and the unskilled.	1.2549679940037906
I am not saying that we do not need to raise the skills within the sector - of course we do - but let us get the jobs established first.	1.5909029879290049
The availability of unskilled, temporary and seasonal work is very important in some of the economic areas of the Community.	1.2418458717748224
Tourism contributes to regional development - in rural areas that are maybe trying to diversify - and tourism contributes to urban areas that aim to raise the profile of their own cultural heritage.	1.3518411930080623
If we take all these aspects together we have the potential of really doing something in Europe and maybe extending the tourism season by staggering holidays right across Europe.	1.1493790089005824
We must not lose sight of the fact that with enlargement we have the potential to increase the number of visitors who come to Europe' s shores to see some of the traditional cultural heritage that has not been opened up to the world for quite a number of years - in fact, about forty years.	1.252037703039589
We are losing market share.	0.652065173921475
I believe we have to do something to make ourselves more competitive.	1.3099130097282108
I hope you will help us.	0.8110131844887162
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are addressing a very important sector that directly involves over 10 million jobs in the European Union and helps the more or less disadvantaged, island and remote areas to stand on their own feet.	1.1270845617126288
And of course, tourism creates more jobs and contributes to the stimulation of employment, especially among society' s more sensitive sections: women and young people.	1.2507586377626936
In view of all this, I think it is a serious contradiction that there is no European policy on tourism.	1.6080409519789551
The lack of any legal base makes it impossible to adopt measures relating to the sector.	0.9127399181426664
The occasional application of Article 308 - formerly Article 235 - which requires unanimity, has prevented the adoption of a programme even of only EUR 8 million for five years and 15 Member States.	1.315509102044761
The measures taken from time to time in the past have been fragmentary and therefore ineffective, and such provisions as have been made were dictated by parallel policies such as consumer protection, environmental policy, transport policy, taxation policy, etc., which very often are not only no help to tourism but on the contrary make it more difficult, since their introduction has usually entailed costs for the tourism industry without regard to its ability to bear them or its incentives to cope with them.	1.3756200899761744
With sorrow, I stress that in the context of restructuring the Commission' s services, tourism is dealt with by a section, not even a directorate, within the Directorate-General for 'Enterprise' .	1.4401560390129984
But we must support our tourism!	1.2484981182458996
In our view, the axes which could create a basis for its support are: the addition of material capital for tourism in the new review which will also constitute a legal base for the sector, the framing of a Community tourism policy to support the sector without disturbing the operation of the tourism market, coordination of the tourism policy with other, parallel Community policies which affect it directly or indirectly, a study of the sector, and the adoption of medium and long-term measures to enhance the competitiveness of tourism as a product.	1.2982022943831577
Mr President, Commissioner, since the issue of employment has been raised, I want to recall another issue which is also very serious, namely the bankruptcies among Tour Operators and their consequences mainly for hotels, which are small or medium enterprises lacking the necessary organisation and access to information that would indicate to them whether or not their contractual partners are trustworthy.	1.2979489817424437
Clearly it is impossible to adopt measures at the national level.	1.0431720169378564
In contrast, at European level it would be possible to look into measures for improving the relations between hotels and Tour Operators, for example a regulation of such relations, the promotion of a special bankruptcy fund, etc., in collaboration with representatives from the two branches.	1.3128907183653733
In the past, the Commission had requested quantitative records of the losses incurred by companies because of such bankruptcies, so that it could form an opinion, and asked the European confederations of hotel-and-restaurant owners and tourist agencies, HOTREC and ECTAA, to work out and draw up a regulation to govern the relations between them.	1.3092691759431545
Since then, however, there has been no progress.	1.0688233165936865
There must therefore be measures to improve the quality and competitiveness of Europe' s tourism and, to the extent of the possible, safeguard the operation of companies.	1.349978937408736
Such measures must also aim to promote rational use of natural and cultural assets and of the tourism infrastructure, so contributing to the balanced and sustainable development of tourism.	1.2050335666611578
I will end by congratulating Mr Viceconte and, as one who comes from Crete, a tourist area, I ask that we should always view tourism not only in terms of pleasant holidays but as a primary job creator in a Europe which needs those jobs.	1.4284295840509016
Mr President, Commissioner, the new attitude adopted recently by the Commission on this important economic activity is striking to those of us who, in recent years, have kept an eye on tourism and its place in the Community framework.	1.4416727909929323
We all know that this change of heart is basically due to the close cause-effect relationship between tourism and employment. It is also due to the recognition by the European Union, since the 1997 conference on these issues, of the enormous potential, represented by tourism, for employment.	1.5171036432973384
In this respect the Commission communication before us today is opportune, as is the report by Mr Viceconte whom I congratulate.	1.6345876880092496
This report contains 34 conclusions, including 15 calls to the Commission to adopt specific measures and actions without forgetting the environmental dimension and cultural protection, particularly in outermost and island regions.	1.3966938266170483
It also contains four calls to the Member States which highlight the need to coordinate actions with the regional authorities and the establishment of measures favourable to tourist-oriented SMEs, particularly in the tax sector and in access to financial instruments. These would encourage the growth of employment in sectors which use labour intensively, such as the tourist sector.	1.2280929461208672
Finally, once this legal basis to which many of us aspire has been established so that a common tourism policy can be developed, we must be realistic and prepare a strategy on tourism and its relationship with employment, as proposed by the Commission with the support of this House. In this strategy, young people and women, training and quality and the new information society must receive preferential attention.	1.5044466161652867
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by thanking Mr Viceconte for his report, which has drawn our attention to a sector which is all too often underestimated.	1.2861157645794519
Tourism is a social, economic and cultural phenomenon which affects most European citizens, either as the recipients or the providers of a wide variety of services.	1.1374809022647676
Every year, nearly 200 million Europeans leave their homes for a short time in order to travel, usually to other countries in Europe.	1.1355868195623675
Moreover, Europe is still the main destination for tourists from third countries, even though it faces increasingly stiff competition and an increasingly diversified and attractive range of products.	1.1399027866430063
Since the Treaties contain no specific legal basis for a real Community tourism policy, the European Union must help to improve and encourage cooperation in this sector, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, in order to take practical advantage of the potential which tourism offers in terms of employment.	1.3448584416419345
Vocational training and a mobile workforce are important tools in the strategy to fight unemployment in Europe especially, as far as tourist service providers are concerned, in meeting multicultural demands and ensuring that services are tailored to customers.	1.2153971394901417
Employment in the tourism sector is often highly seasonal and precarious, thereby hampering its sustainable development.	1.028436015230982
It is therefore even more urgent that we acquire and disseminate managerial and technological skills in order to promote new means of production and a supply of tourism which reflects market developments as closely as possible.	1.123392863190531
As the report notes, the adoption by the Member States of tax incentives for SMEs in order to reduce labour costs would be an excellent way of promoting growth in employment in labour-intensive sectors and, consequently, in the tourism sector.	1.4520166180899878
This sector of activity is also a deciding factor in the economic and social development of less favoured regions, especially the most remote and island regions, which have undisputed assets in this area.	1.4170756204328918
Let us not forget that, in the most remote regions, tourism is the most important industry in terms of income.	1.2037586237795315
The income and employment generated by tourism help enormously in reducing imbalances and encouraging their economies to converge with the average rate of growth in the Community.	0.879379129212799
In addition, tourism can promote a certain cultural and economic rapprochement, insofar as it makes us more aware of other European cultures and thus helps respect for European ways of life to develop.	1.1809485915504936
It goes without saying, therefore, that tourism, developed rationally in the long term, should represent a sustainable source of income for local economies, while safeguarding and enhancing the value of the rural, cultural, historical and environmental heritage.	1.2714931314279236
I should like to close by stressing the essential role which the European Union should play in promoting new forms of tourism in new places which will allow continental Europeans to discover the most far-flung destinations in Europe, namely the most remote regions.	1.3033489100001185
Mr President, we are having a major debate on a text of very little substance. The basic document is really no more than a Commission communication which embraces the conclusions and recommendations of a high level group on tourism and employment.	1.4491881246485718
Not only is there very little substance but this is also a rather old document dating from 28 April 1999 which therefore makes it nearly a year old.	1.1640348361012438
This document stems from the previous Commission. It is undoubtedly the result of work carried out by Commissioner Papoutsis throughout his term of office and which culminated in the Luxembourg summit and his failed Philoxenia programme.	1.178378356340644
I believe this is the first debate in this House with the new Commission and a new Commissioner, Mr Liikanen, who is of course listening very closely to what we are discussing.	1.7508427947108702
I would take this opportunity to ask him a couple of questions directly.	1.028443430544029
Firstly, the governments made a commitment at the Maastricht Conference of 1992 to include a legal basis for this issue in the Treaties. This commitment was not fulfilled in the Treaty of Amsterdam of 1997 and is therefore outstanding.	1.4687645203084025
Yet there is a Council resolution from last June on tourism and employment.	1.0700745876919358
What expectations does the Commissioner have that the new Intergovernmental Conference which is starting will include this aspect?	1.1151051186823755
My second question is much more direct and perhaps more awkward.	0.988766277957304
Bearing in mind the failed efforts of the last decade, as highlighted by Mr Koch, does Commissioner Liikanen believe that he can do something during his term of office to ensure that the Community dimension of tourism becomes a proper policy, given the importance that all the previous speakers have given to tourism in terms of employment?	1.457518791274976
Will the Commission present new initiatives in order to see whether, through the constant efforts of the Commission and Parliament, we can gradually convince the Council to do something on this issue?	1.6063671830173571
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Viceconte, who spoke at such length on the tangible possibility, for the fifteen Member States of the Union, of creating jobs by way of a sensible policy, a sensible European Union initiative in this field.	1.3815487049265853
This very afternoon we have had a debate on workers who suddenly find themselves unemployed. We now hope to be able to solve these problems.	1.2616295222089493
Tourism is an activity that falls decidedly and fundamentally within the competence of the European Union.	0.7706284751595124
All the European States are known throughout the world for being tourist magnets envied by all, including the United States of America, which we spoke about this afternoon with regard to the native Americans.	1.4843727840425935
I would like to stress one point in the Viceconte report which I welcome and particularly support, and which I would like the House and the Commission to reflect on before giving a favourable response.	1.6351804657093192
It regards tourism for senior citizens.	0.6102269010324592
I usually see Commissioner Diamantopoulou desperately tearing her hair out, bit by bit, because the elderly live too long, leading to problems with pension payments.	1.0555027362235498
However, in this case, the fact that we are living longer means that there are more senior citizens.	1.5204074887286563
Unfortunately not all, but many of them travel the world to see its marvels and to discover and learn more about it: Italians want to see what the English are like, the Greeks want to see what the Turks are like and the French want to see their Italian cousins.	1.3683976960023736
Tourism brings the peoples of the fifteen States and of the entire world closer together, and of course, it leads to peace and understanding.	1.4886435238514557
This kind of tourism, which is undertaken mainly by large numbers of senior citizens, is just as important.	1.335377466308139
This type of tourism must be promoted and supported because it allows people to work in tourist destinations, not just during the summer when we go swimming in the sea, for example, but also during winter when we go to take the air.	1.356315836488718
Senior citizens are always on holiday, all year round, from 1 January through to 31 December because they do not work and do not have just one month off during the year.	1.2557268530763688
Unfortunately, this is not true of them all, but this is why I am calling on the Commission to follow up on the Viceconte report.	1.6809430005311485
. Mr President, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Viceconte and congratulate him on the report.	1.090037321031025
I think we all acknowledge the economic, social and environmental importance of tourism in today' s developed Europe and its great potential for growth and employment.	1.090776658013058
I am glad to see that the Commission and Parliament are converging towards the same goal in this area.	1.1119142307557832
Employment issues are at present the core concern regarding tourism.	0.9869246127486087
An essential condition in order to make good progress in the work in this respect is that the cooperation with Member States and the industry and with other partners be as fruitful as possible.	1.4904999515531825
This will determine the success of our work.	0.9624421530622157
Certainly the Commission will seek good coordination with national employment policies.	1.1225734575512205
This will also be important with a view to the special summit in March, where tourism is bound to be mentioned as a significant contributor to employment.	1.2482049801939867
Coordination of Community tourism activities with other important issues such as regional policies, transport, employment, environment, culture and competition must strongly involve Member States and the tourism industry itself.	1.1624941528774302
As far as specific policies are concerned, I would like to pinpoint just one on which the draft resolution focuses - regional policy.	1.3025169499678042
The Commission guideline document for the new structural fund' s programming period has already identified tourism as one of the areas with particular potential for employment creation through competitive enterprises.	1.1059086143551624
The Commission expects Member States to put increased emphasis on tourism measures in their plans and programming.	1.0318791995570664
Quality, sustainability, innovation are at the forefront of the Commission' s own policy and are priorities recognised by the Council of Ministers.	1.2662301051319278
Quality products in order to improve competitiveness, sustainability in order to protect resources and innovation in particular through the use of information technologies.	1.1889162975638827
Regarding sustainability indicators, the European Environment Agency is already working with the Commission on the issue.	1.4904632109835354
I want to mention, as has already been mentioned by many speakers today, that tourism related to the natural and cultural heritage is expected to be the fastest expanding form of tourism in the EU during the next two decades.	1.456020672178794
These possibilities should be fully exploited.	0.8234891643342345
Mr Provan said that I often talk a lot about tourism and information technology.	1.0361448511058327
I am personally convinced that information and communication technologies will be a key competitiveness and innovation factor for European tourism.	1.1237733693248857
The travel and tourism sector is the front-runner in making use of ICT tools.	0.9343397812942417
This will dramatically change the way it operates.	0.9661444344302106
Marketing, reservation and transport are expected to be the areas of profoundest change and improvement.	1.0275951796682916
Use of ICT opens a completely new dimension in the context of travel and tourism.	0.9810208807587691
Direct business to consumer contact will supplement, and sometimes also reduce, the currently, nearly exclusive business to business relationship.	1.2852163441014566
It will give more and better choice to tourists and generate new and better tourist products.	0.885366948083697
For the Commission this requires that action in the tourism field must be tightly linked to measures promoting the take-up of information communication technology by the tourism industry, in particular by the innovation and innovative society technological programmes which are both within my competence.	1.2546852350792033
The new strategy outlined by the Commission communication on tourism and employment, and agreed by the Council, places the emphases on tourism gathering and disseminating information and good practice.	1.2495837292310754
The implementation of the directive on statistics aims at improving the knowledge of market structures and trends in European tourism and its industry.	1.2028639769049145
Commission decisions have advanced the methodological approach.	0.6604058373890944
The report on the experience acquired in the work carried out under this directive is part of our work programme for the current year.	1.365903079078185
More work on the social and economic impact of tourism is currently on-going with the international organisations, such as the World Tourism Organisation.	1.2032819678134614
The European Community' s prime role is to ensure a framework which enables and encourages stakeholders and authorities at all levels to optimise and realise the tourism sector' s potential for growth and employment.	1.1546218940827908
Such a European strategy will be achieved through building on the commitment by Member States and the Commission to cooperate in a number of priority areas: exchange and dissemination of information, notably through new technologies; training in order to upgrade skills, quality of tourist products and sustainable development in tourism.	1.1861502269278645
In the autumn the Commission will report back on the progress made in this respect.	1.2233316354040524
A report on the work to be undertaken, together with the Member States and the tourism industry should be available in about two years from now.	1.1593949184080474
Depending on the results of this work, a wider debate could then take place which might well be the starting-point for even more comprehensive policy initiatives.	1.180407102900035
Mr Medina Ortega asked me some very concrete questions.	0.7759775178169612
As regards the role of tourism policy in the communities concerned, we must understand that many policy sectors have a huge impact on the framework on tourism.	1.2804549961184066
It is not only the targeted, specific tourism actions which are important but the other horizontal actions in the field of transport.	1.2475149115512756
At the moment, the question of congestion of air and roads is the fundamental problem.	1.1096824444604962
In the area of environment, we are looking at ways to cooperate with Mrs Wallström; in the area of regional policy Mr Barnier is giving a lot of attention to this sector.	1.5305564275693577
We need to have this streamlined approach on tourism which covers all the policies.	1.2875017920298157
I am sure that we will improve on that in the future when we have had a good high-level working group report, your support with your report here and also when the tourism sector is part of enterprise policy.	1.47730880313482
Why is it so important in that sector?	0.8906557977227904
It is because the key emphasis on the enterprise policy will be how to help to create new enterprises; how to make it easier for young people and women to create their own enterprises.	1.213299040875167
That is where the potential is.	0.8005860175012574
If we can eliminate the obstacles to make it cheaper to create new enterprises, to facilitate the access to financing and to change the attitude of society to be more positive entrepreneurship, I am sure the tourism sector will be the first to benefit from this.	1.5012449577849822
There is one problem that I hesitate to mention today as I am new in the sector.	1.240011212423815
I have been working now in all industrial and service sectors, but when you look at the organisational structure in tourism it is almost impossible.	1.2859843845393344
It is very difficult for a Commissioner to try to work in an area where there are dozens of different organisations whose representativeness needs to be ascertained every time.	1.2141714970378372
To strengthen the role of tourism in Europe, the organisations should do what has happened in most economic sectors: seek better focus, better coordination and concentrated activities.	1.2765376889187632
Then we could have a solid dialogue in our everyday work.	1.0497364718877835
That is the real difficulty which we must overcome.	1.3582378889102464
As far as the Treaty is concerned, the intergovernmental conference started this week so we do not know the results yet.	1.4475042451575468
I want to be very candid: I have not seen much enthusiasm about that conference or the proposal to enlarge the powers of the EU.	1.5129849156130948
Tourism is also in the list of subjects which do not figure as new areas of competence for the EU.	0.9737246789563888
We will see what happens but at the moment that seems to be the case.	1.4052151319689723
Finally, the Commission welcomes the resolution which continues the line of the high-level group, the Commission communication on enhancing tourism' s potential for employment and the corresponding Council conclusions.	1.3468997520085215
The general agreement between both institutions in this field must not keep the Commission from following the most pragmatic approach in achieving our common objectives.	1.1201859935962941
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6737777542510281
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.	0.6204212530316258
(The sitting was closed at 7.40 p.m.)	0.6496601847660328
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	0.4510321946745718
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.	0.3735514178617478
Are there any comments?	0.1337831580886173
Mr President, yesterday' s Minutes will naturally indicate interventions referring to the so-called 'Strasbourg Declaration" which intends to implicate the European Parliament in certain considerations which would literally lead to the conclusion that I am a Nazi.	1.3039225723329333
This declaration - which, as I have said, implicates the European Parliament, although no such declaration was put before this Parliament - is a completely unacceptable form of manipulation.	1.3040369097932576
I thank the President, Mrs Fontaine, who just yesterday expressed her opinion by refuting the implication of this House.	1.3146881090410634
Mr President, as well as discrediting the PNV, Eusko Alkartasuna and the democratic government of the Basque Country - who have the kind of attitude which, in the case of Ireland, deserved the Nobel prize - by calling them Nazis, the declaration insults representatives of the European citizens - as in my case: I represent a section of Galician society - by saying that we are more dangerous than the Nazis, and insults groups which are clearly democratic, with decades of history, in an unacceptable and crazy way, which I would like to condemn here and now.	1.500905592608342
I would like these words to be heard, because the European Parliament cannot be implicated in this way in a crazy declaration which I consider to be totally unacceptable.	1.5067098747715728
Thank you, Mr Nogueira, for your explanation.	1.5688623709545129
I would remind you that questions on the Minutes should refer to the Minutes.	0.9604720810297251
In any event, for those Members who not aware of the President' s position, I will read the official communication and it will thereby appear in today' s Minutes:	1.396642432771135
"On 17 February, Mrs Nicole Fontaine, President of the European Parliament, received as guests, at their request, the representatives of the Forum d' Ermua.	1.2465108948607924
The Spanish Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament were represented.	1.28578774033228
Following this interview, the representatives of this Forum presented her with a text entitled "Strasbourg Declaration" . The President wishes to specify that under no circumstances does she sanction the terms of this "declaration" .	1.246063225120908
Strasbourg, 17 February" .	0.8098128321376267
I therefore believe that the issue is totally cleared up.	1.125043658346251
Mr President, I would like to request a correction to the Minutes regarding the vote on Amendment No 5 of the Swoboda report.	1.1769327199713522
Please note that Mr Michel Raymond, Mr Jean Saint-Josse and I voted against this amendment.	1.129891547301415
We take note and this will appear in the Minutes.	1.0399475794213904
Mr President, this is not exactly a point of order but concerns a communication we have before us today, namely that the Conference of Presidents open to Members, which was scheduled for 23 February, has now been cancelled.	1.5010381309326208
We should consider on principle whether there is any point at all in holding these kinds of meetings.	1.0943860345915777
I have the feeling they are just another compulsory exercise we have to perform.	1.2964141295413323
We can just as easily find out what happened from the newspapers.	0.8739590474719929
That would be more productive and I do not like seeing the various committee agendas that are already overloaded being cut again and again because of this kind of show-piece.	1.2223122239725654
So I think we should consider simply abolishing these meetings once and for all.	1.046270228023063
Mr Bösch, I take note of your observation but, clearly, we hold this type of Conference of Presidents, open to all MEPs at the original request of the MEPs, so that they may participate in some of them.	1.4319925752486293
Surely we should be more selective.	1.2331023246364679
In any event, the Bureau will consider your suggestion.	0.9727352212514639
(The Minutes were approved)	0.08791063492812108
VOTE	-0.0
Mr President, we should like to request that the last sentence of Amendment No 2 which reads: 'also calls on the Member States to promote tourism for the elderly' be incorporated into Paragraph 25, which deals specifically with social tourism, after: 'tourism for organised social groups...'.	1.4283625857032745
We think its inclusion there would be both more appropriate and more effective.	0.8801544352584124
Mr President, the subsidiarity principle is one of the fundamental principles underlying cooperation in the European Union.	1.2922752684971446
It is high time it was properly evaluated and that a system was set up which clearly identifies the EU's areas of competence.	1.1270046686523858
A criticism which is often levelled at the EU and which, to some extent, is justified is that it is involved in far too many areas.	1.4424185680179613
One such area is tourism which, by its very nature, is very much a national concern.	1.3250948682051937
In so far as tourism falls within the political domain, it should be at national, regional and local level.	1.1077746561722135
Tourism is a major source of employment and has a role to play as regards the EU's financial support for less well-off regions.	1.2999430389275557
Even in that respect, any cooperation should, however, be carried out according to the subsidiarity principle.	1.3392892375061087
Because tourism can also have a harmful impact on the environment, there needs to be a strategy for damage limitation.	1.375758007102341
However, such a strategy should come within the framework of environmental policy.	1.6028853642495167
The report laments the lack of a legal basis for a policy on tourism.	1.191637102685434
However, the Swedish Christian Democrats would oppose any such development as we believe that tourism is a matter with which the European Union should only be marginally concerned.	1.4577692485784357
. (DA) Tourism is a significant source of international understanding and an important part of the labour market, which ought to be promoted and encouraged.	1.2644796628708372
It is of inestimable importance that people in Europe, as well as in the rest of the world, should have the opportunity to experience each other' s ways of ordering their lives and their societies.	1.1580042616730641
Policy on tourism is not, however, something which ought to be planned and decided upon by the European Parliament or by the EU as a whole.	1.3610723290279427
I am therefore voting against the proposal.	1.1429222242361379
Mr President, before we begin our discussion, as an Italian MEP - and I believe I also speak on behalf of all Italian MEPs - I should like to condemn the position taken yesterday by the German Chancellor, who interfered in Italian internal affairs, when he threatened that Europe would intervene if any neo-fascists became members of the government.	1.5666977531844446
Fortunately, the Italian Government and the President of the Republic intervened, and today the Italian Ambassador to Germany will also speak on the subject, to call on the German Chancellor not to interfere in Italian internal affairs, in so far as there are no neo-fascist candidates for government office.	1.4501572487715257
We would like to thank the President of the Republic, as well as the Government and all the politicians who spoke and we too, in this House, would also call on the German Chancellor not to intervene in Italian internal affairs.	1.4171396207002456
Mr Tajani will accept that it is a little difficult to understand the relationship between his intervention and the points of order, but I understand his political meaning.	1.409931863817316
We will proceed to the debate itself and Mr Monti will take the floor on behalf of the Commission.	1.1036995452146745
European postal services	-0.0
The next item is the debate on the oral question (B5-0010/2000) tabled by Mr Hatzidakis, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, to the Commission, on European postal services.	1.1086309745936085
Mr President, the Commission's proposal on further gradual and controlled liberalisation of postal services has been delayed mainly because of the reorganisation and reallocation of duties within the Commission and the fact that the new Commission needs to re-examine the issues involved.	1.3739300027728054
With regard to Parliament's various resolutions on the postal sector, my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, has already responded to some of the main points at the hearings which Parliament held last year.	1.299416612500011
Furthermore, as regards consultations with Parliament, Commissioner Bolkestein will meet the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism next Monday.	1.445076246282298
The studies were sent to the committee and to the MEPs who requested them, in September 1999 and are, in any case, still available.	1.4722336093570318
They can also be consulted on the Commission's Internet website.	1.332068060706008
I am sure Commissioner Bolkestein will listen carefully to all Parliament's comments.	1.163612828745594
The Commission is firmly convinced of the need to prepare a new proposal on developing the postal sector.	1.2889714540893262
Furthermore, the submission of a proposal is a legal obligation.	1.3140035794962275
I can confirm that it is Commissioner Bolkestein' s firm intention to present a proposal to the Commission by the middle of the year, to be forwarded to Parliament and the Council.	1.3625856736043833
The date set for completing the next phase, which the Commission intends to keep to, is 1 January 2003.	1.37240468007478
The proposal will take account of the studies and, in particular, the need to maintain a universal service, to develop efficient safeguards for consumers, to create a climate favourable to new jobs and to solve any problems relating to competition.	1.2054335203356719
The role of liberalisation in modernising and improving postal services throughout the Union with the help of new technologies will be examined in order to identify potential benefits for the industry as a whole.	1.1274996200836802
The proposal, when it is put forward, will take account of the points of view of Member States, Parliament, users, universal service providers and their competitors and by other interested parties, all of whom have been involved in an in-depth consultation process.	1.3184509892083107
The aim is to ensure that the internal market in postal services functions smoothly in the interests of consumers and businesses throughout the European Union.	0.997949734823406
Mr President, the postal sector continues to be an area in which old, outdated monopolies are allowed to operate regardless of the requirements of competition.	1.3105983586898065
And, in the absence of any energetic action by the Commission, the situation has gone on for far too long.	1.3720911049713842
The EU' s competition authority has intervened in all other areas, but not in the postal sector.	1.176993652617011
We have now been waiting in vain for 18 months for the Commission to put forward proposals, so I should be grateful if the Commissioner could let me know today when we are likely to have a new, modern Europe-wide postal system.	1.250257769420703
One of the EU' s most important tenets is the need for a common internal market.	1.388533810542043
We are currently working hard to enlarge this to include ever more Member States.	0.8768737461183236
That requires greater efficiency which, in turn, is dependent on competition.	1.2206559174999887
Today, one area after another is being compelled to introduce deregulation and liberalisation, an exercise in which the EU often leads the way, while the Commission's determination to make progress serves as a model.	1.389521983671744
The Commission is committed to liberalisation because experience has shown that the old monopolies are unable to provide the efficient service which a modern society expects.	1.0663263378651107
It is also because liberalisation is necessary in order to be able to keep up with technological advances and, moreover, because it will lead to lower prices. All that, we are assured, will be more easily attained in a free and competitive market.	1.4617868116799788
It has been done in a number of different areas but, unfortunately, the postal sector has remained the one major exception until now.	1.2735533396420824
It can hardly be because customers are satisfied.	0.676977140151898
We are all familiar with the much-criticised price hikes, and delayed deliveries are a constant topic of discussion.	1.0631565604874091
If we really want a functioning internal market, we cannot go on constantly making an exception of the postal services.	1.230826211047746
A number of countries have been in the forefront of introducing more competitive postal services.	1.2457457287677853
The Netherlands, Finland and Sweden have travelled furthest along this road.	0.8726626951366147
During the 1990s, they were able to show the benefits that could be achieved.	1.2822192133974128
Moreover, Sweden has introduced the changes gradually in a climate of political consensus.	1.2362190811192946
The process should be allowed to continue and be given the necessary encouragement.	1.0163490291255148
Experience has shown that the old monopolies cannot provide the type of efficient service which, as customers, we are all entitled to expect.	1.1929182125357225
Prior to this discussion, a letter was sent out by supporters of the old monopolies.	1.2427694367311792
They hold up Sweden as a warning, which might be appropriate in certain instances, but not as regards postal services.	1.4358710505349157
It is alleged in a circular that the price of postage has gone up by 59 per cent since liberalisation in 1993.	0.8738294007116266
That is true as long as account is taken of the 20 per cent of the total postal services market where, in practice, there is still a monopoly, that is where the state is the only player.	1.4543160390031304
However, for the 80 per cent of services where there is a competitive market, prices have fallen.	1.4551771774903912
That shows that competition really is working.	0.6909030145854498
My conclusion is therefore: make sure that there is competition in the remaining 20 per cent of the market, too.	1.192340468529098
It is against just such a background that more and more people are calling for ...	0.8805045178995593
(The speaker is interrupted by Mr Markov) I thought I had the floor.	1.0640274731530301
Perhaps we can discuss this later on.	0.6133435930818822
However, I should like to affirm that it is exactly as I said, namely, that prices have fallen in areas where there is competition, whereas they have risen where there is still a monopoly.	1.3886264138156688
That is usually the case.	0.5417325787201347
That is why I should now like to see a Commission that takes the necessary initiatives and sees to it that there is effective competition in the postal sector.	1.2846142987026774
Mr Markov, in five or six minutes time, you will be allowed a few minutes to speak.	1.367246729486572
I would be grateful if you would not interrupt other Members.	1.0051098712795599
Mr President, there is a mystery.	1.2813589563641896
What happened to the Postal Services Directive that was passed on 15 December 1997?	0.980625776202355
There has been a deafening silence from the Commission during the period between then and now.	1.0730362540950427
I am sorry it is Commissioner Monti who is here today.	1.1369961326257203
I am very fond of him.	1.0418428445011345
He is one of the more diligent and hard working commissioners.	0.9859158153797325
It is a pity I cannot say the same for some of his other colleagues.	1.4987632819188774
There has, over this period, been no real progress on the Postal Services Directive.	1.3197173709000802
Commissioner Monti stated that part of the reason for this was the organisation and reallocation of duties.	1.035326505385135
That has only happened recently.	0.5806899787390365
For over a year the old Commission could have done some work on this.	1.10876498395201
We really have not progressed very far.	0.8778822974907182
However, since Commissioner Monti is here, I would like him to take a message back to Commissioner Bolkestein telling him what the Postal Services Directive was about.	1.5079783983871422
It was about gradual liberalisation; it was about a guaranteed universal service at an affordable price; it was about direct mail and cross-border mail remaining in the reserved sector.	1.2663323496587622
These issues were fundamental in that report and they should be fundamental in any forthcoming directive.	0.9874108612082194
The postal service is not just for Christmas.	1.473120497461367
It is for life.	1.0509166549842601
In the area in Scotland I come from it is much more than just a postal service.	1.2707641432583414
It is about keeping communities together.	0.9691372755912055
The postal service is also the bus service.	0.9253364410723294
The postal service is also the social service.	0.9598517765086841
The postal service is also the doctor.	0.9075890909665187
If we allow the postal services to drift into complete privatisation then we will lose all that and many of our local communities - we were voting earlier on tourism - will lose their tourist trade.	1.415689992033701
We will cut them off.	0.6585557462039803
The postal services are important.	0.8606256290226936
That message must be taken back from here today.	0.9405330296591613
The Commission must listen to it.	1.0739310838659137
Mr President, we are in favour of liberalising the Union' s postal services.	1.3418287765697228
This should first of all stand for better service.	1.1280765881300168
This is the intention and it must be the ultimate goal.	1.2530843578286934
Liberalisation began because there was doubt regarding the structure of the postal services and the value of a monopoly.	1.019259111328209
Is a monopoly flexible enough in a market where the customer' s requirements and the market situation can change very rapidly, because, for example, the use of electronic data carriers has increased dramatically?	1.0995859561543841
The question is, therefore: what are the demands that a monopoly or part of a service which is governed by a monopoly needs to meet?	1.2768690553474442
Most Member States have been putting the brakes on, and I am pleased to note that, in my country, the new government has at long last completed something which should have been done a long time ago, and that the Belgian postal services and the Belgian government are now taking measures to ensure that the postal services are ready - at least partly ready - by 2003 to be able to stand up to the competition.	1.5159962668635207
As you can see, as a new MEP, I am trying to get to grips with the dossier and I must admit that I have great difficulty doing so.	1.3332766424612759
I have found a number of studies which were commissioned by the European Commission at the time, and I am also coming across documents from Post-Europe which claims that these studies are inaccurate and that the basis on which these were carried out is incorrect.	1.2978752023201547
I think that the Commission could have been more pro-active on this score and could have also provided us with the studies which it had promised to give us and which we had requested.	1.3651954198220402
As far as I know, that has still not happened.	1.4383695545839
I would therefore ask you, Commissioner, to help me in my task as a new Member.	1.2582171689264248
Like Mr Miller, I would welcome an explanation from you regarding the implementation of the 1997 directive within the next couple of months or weeks or, if at all possible, within the next couple of days.	1.3150253022882044
My second point concerns the universal provision of services. What is happening on this score, how much does it cost, how does it work, how do you intend to organise it and what proposals do you have?	1.2838430537689618
I would welcome more concrete information on this.	0.966505058752146
Apparently, the postal service is a very strong lobby and rightly so.	1.3350846692287741
There are hundreds of thousands of people who earn their living at the Post Office.	0.8848634652275584
Moreover - and Mr Miller has already pointed this out - it will surely not be the end of the world if the postman no longer comes round, even in my country, however densely populated it may be.	1.6515994512907606
But in Belgium too, there are a great number of people, older people for example, who only see one other person in the day and that is the postman.	1.613472093363666
We should not overlook this fact: postal service is about more than just ferrying around letters and parcels.	1.18274003348163
The postal service is also extremely important to companies.	0.896769569800948
A study has shown that 90% of the postal traffic is between companies and only 10% between individuals.	1.1245597244109145
What exactly do you intend to liberalise?	0.5734064497712645
I would like more information on this, because the key question is how you can better serve the customer using the existing services.	1.4236750839210848
There are postal companies which have a monopoly and are doing a reasonably good job.	1.0992238009902862
We need to protect this type of arrangement and denounce other things.	1.0348607761379283
Mr President, Commissioner, this morning on French national radio, I heard that liberalisation of the French postal service was now only a matter of days or hours away and that it was irreparable, like the developments with our neighbours in Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany.	1.4554840731140477
This concerns us deeply and that is why we requested this debate today.	1.2222886692389479
The Commission is committed to a universal postal service, as the European Parliament has shown on several occasions, the postal service is actually, as some speakers have already mentioned, a key factor in social and territorial cohesion.	1.4424787291318355
In this connection I should like to ask one of our Swedish MEPs for an opinion of the study which has been carried out and which shows that in fact in the most remote areas of Sweden the postal service was rather poor in terms of distribution.	1.3939880270397629
That is not the sort of postal service that we want.	1.1938410699554578
The economic value of the postal service was recognised by the Treaty of Amsterdam and we consider that it goes far beyond the distribution of mail.	1.232330210512004
It is the service which remains closest to the citizens and which we call a 'public service' , which makes it possible for everyone resident within European territory to receive the service, and this entitlement must remain an acquired right, an acquis communautaire.	1.4580815153999187
The matter of the European Union' s recognition of a high-quality postal service, available to all, remains valid today, and we are increasingly concerned.	1.4819816888822743
That is why today we are asking not to have any nasty surprises in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism come Monday.	1.2647500895640802
Let us point out that Parliament' s positions were clearly defined and that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supported them.	0.962181760912312
This resolution of 14 January 1999 required that, prior to undertaking any liberalisation of this key sector, involving 1.7 million employees after all, the Commission should provide impact studies for this liberalisation.	1.2552747475775485
Well, we are not convinced that the studies currently available make it possible to implement this liberalisation right now and we are concerned because it is well known that liberalisation without impact studies would cause thousands of job losses, something we certainly do not want.	1.3906888039259568
We value our public service, our universal postal service, because we know, and here too we are acting as representatives of the citizens, that the citizens value this service and the Commission undertook, during Mr Bolkestein' s hearing, to maintain this universal service throughout the European Union.	1.5168659745408042
I shall not repeat all the various statements he made at his hearing, I think we all still remember them.	1.3411196116158892
We further maintain that we are waiting for this proper evaluation before any definitive decision, as stipulated in the directive and the revision of the 1997 directive.	1.1083986387589633
We shall not accept a date for the liberalisation of all activities in the postal sector until the Commission has offered us a guarantee that the universal service will be integrated into this directive and that the public postal service will be maintained in the States which consider this service essential to the citizen.	1.3110451691325005
Mr President, I share the view that we need to make more progress from the point of view of efficiency and the analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the services offered.	1.3100946870888683
But as an entrepreneur myself, I really cannot understand why it is always assumed this can only be done under the headings of "privatisation" and "liberalisation"!	1.2072833738776416
Or perhaps people are not concerned with creating the same conditions of access to the postal services for all, but are thinking only of the capital employment conditions for companies in large conglomerations.	1.3210521360344611
Members should however represent all the citizens, which means it is their duty to think not in terms of business management but in terms of the national economy.	1.3800179752375787
In practice that means the following for the postal services: firstly, priority must be given to employment.	1.2434900323410651
I have nothing against liberalisation and privatisation, but the premises must be right.	1.1583533834721873
Secondly, we must guarantee that the citizens are not faced with reduced postal services.	1.4392013725510309
Examples in Germany and Sweden show that this certainly is a risk.	1.0717614981503987
Mr Stenmarck, Sweden is the only country in which prices rose far higher after liberalisation than in all the other Member States of the European Union.	1.1750672396079733
So that is another potential effect and one that we must prevent.	1.3902253827831643
Thirdly, it is vital to have, first of all, a universal postal service at an affordable price for all citizens, wherever they may be; secondly, to have a uniform price for all Member States; and thirdly, to have daily mail deliveries and collections on working days.	1.2956444937686955
On the question of the cost-effectiveness of the various postage weights, it is worth considering further price cuts; but that is what the postal administration itself is saying.	1.4115908057457016
We do not have to adhere to a weight of over 300g when the analysis shows that we need to ensure a minimum weight of 150g to make it at all worthwhile.	1.2242320694304683
In that respect I believe it was right and important to hold this debate today, to make Mr Bolkestein aware of Parliament' s position and allow him to take certain aspects into account from the outset.	1.4012469996618517
Mr President, the 1997 directive, issued on 21 January 1998, which undertook the partial liberalisation of postal services in Europe, envisaged a revision at a later date, in a rather convoluted manner, indeed, since it was to be dealt with in a Commission proposal by the end of 1998, then decided by 1 January 2000, to come into force finally by 1 January 2003.	1.3893120038069289
Well, for the time being, the revision has not got off the starting block.	1.317491869219046
The two initial phases were not observed which, logically, ought to compromise the third.	0.9225612818845397
My first question is this: surely the scheduled time limits were too short in any case?	1.018047089065132
Apparently, they were.	1.3846205037141053
It is really not possible to see how the Commission could by the end of 1998, as stipulated by Article 7 of the directive, have evaluated the effects of a text which came into force in February of the same year.	1.480916732029247
Moreover, the Commission was also not able to provide the implementation report which, according to Article 23, it was to submit by 31 December 2000.	1.542018837405085
Should we complain about this delay?	0.6059243432038198
We do not think so.	0.9290580392112485
If the Commission actually did have convincing evidence in support of taking liberalisation forwards, no one doubts that it would present it without delay.	1.1890600726973883
For its part, the European Parliament, which had fought hard to ensure that the 1997 directive was balanced and respected the requirements of a universal public service, is rather satisfied to see that the compromise it obtained then is proving to be tenable.	1.2906589456383428
In these circumstances, it is quite reasonable for this House to express concern today, asking an oral question which urges the Commission to show the definite and unquestionable feasibility studies which to date no one has seen.	1.2638359720992969
What are the scenarios for development and the potential risks?	1.2857722897200896
The main risk is that the Commission, without adequate justification, might upset the balance which exists now by proposing to go swiftly on to a second phase of liberalisation which would, in some countries, throw off balance the funding of the universal postal service, making it unmanageable.	1.2998547350033773
Today, following the 1997 compromise, Member States can give public monopolies responsibility for the postal service involving mail and parcels whose distribution cost is less than five times the basic tariff, with a weight of less than 350 grammes.	1.22189721485204
It may be supposed, for example, as Commissioner Bolkestein gave us to understand during his hearing on 6 September last year, that the Commission might propose reducing these limits to 50 grams and two and a half times the basic tariff.	1.2207337320408629
This solution would not, in our opinion, be a fair one and indeed the Commission would have no irrefutable figures to support it.	1.3686283437829434
But, unfortunately, we are aware since Seattle that the Commission has no need of a proper assessment of the previous stage before proposing that we go rapidly on to the next stage.	1.4153357260269965
The second scenario, which we prefer: to defer the revision and maintain the current situation until such time as we do actually have a proper, detailed objective study of the effects of the 1997 directive.	1.2716317697213302
In saying that, we are not seeking to protect monopolies whose pernicious effects we are already familiar with, but we wish to be certain that it is possible to combine the gradual evolution of the organisations with maintaining the key principles of public service.	1.3901235992148506
Finally, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group wonders if the idea of foisting unified management rules on the postal services of the fifteen Member States might not be, essentially, flawed.	1.1269030141697527
In France, for example, the unequal distribution of the population over a vast territorial area makes the obligation to provide a public service absolutely indispensable in mail distribution if one wishes to maintain the equality of citizens and social cohesion.	1.0872788769860766
But other countries, in other situations, may have alternative analyses.	1.3962672851764117
In our opinion, each one must be free to make its own organisational choices.	1.2173553648578312
In fact, Article 86 of the EC Treaty, formerly Article 90, stipulates that services of general economic interest are subject to the rules on competition only insofar as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance of the particular tasks assigned to them.	1.1374814202162857
But who defines these tasks?	0.49918592598717987
Who established the limit beyond which this public service mission is compromised?	0.8454397486340078
Our answer is clear: it is not the Commission nor even the Council or the European Parliament, but the people of each Member State by democratic procedures.	1.556753938939956
To wish to proceed in any other way would be to distort the spirit of our institutions.	1.2157496568273778
Mr President, we are currently in the first phase of transposition of Directive 97/67/CE on postal services and I am terribly afraid that a new phase of liberalisation might be reflected in a significant reduction in the public service offered.	1.380378784001311
During Mr Bolkestein' s hearing, my colleague Véronique Mathieu asked for an undertaking "that any new proposals, once these are known, should be the subject of impact studies to determine the implications of this liberalisation programme before these provisions are adopted."	1.1388546637884074
What has become of it?	0.6272353209552451
Do we have the results of this impact study?	1.3506001138418307
As you know, we members of the EDD Group, are in favour, along with others, of rural life, maintaining employment, and social cohesion in rural areas, a cohesion reinforced by high quality universal public service.	1.5770427595432865
Most assuredly I would like to be able to say that the examples I observe every day in my own country and in my own region, a very rural one, convince me that we can safely proceed to a new phase of liberalisation.	1.395454822112228
Unfortunately, this is not the case and currently, by merging the start of the application of the European directive and the application of the 35-hour law, which is purely French, but also by changing the working time criteria, such as the 1 700 objects per hour to be handled per workstation as opposed to 1 400, as previously, in our rural areas we can observe either a reduction in public opening hours or a threat that some post offices will be closed.	1.3994569097510607
This is already an intolerable withdrawal of the public service.	1.1191397845347146
I have here the local paper for my municipality, which reads, "The manager of the post office wishes to inform the local population that as of 3 January 2000" - you can see how topical this is - "the last collection will take place at 3.45 p.m. instead of at 4.30 p.m. as at present."	1.4140456025138233
So you can appreciate why I am afraid of a phase of extensive liberalisation, and a package of measures which will entail a new wave of depopulation.	1.3113956162361466
As you know, in our country, each village has its own local post office or at least a post box, with a collection every day.	1.3826004524959925
The postman is not just a simple mail distribution operative but also the only social link with the local residents.	1.21649767440128
So he delivers money too, and sometimes even medicines, thus making it possible for isolated elderly people to be supported in living at home.	1.318082662694936
If postal services are liberalised in a poorly regulated way, more post offices will be closed, in the name of this infamous profitability, which is often the cause of rural regression.	1.370993772285751
Once again, Europe is distancing itself from its poorest and most vulnerable inhabitants.	0.9942708797773679
They will be told that they are too expensive, without drawing any comparison with other social services such as police and health services but also sports and cultural services, where lack of profitability is scarcely admitted in urban areas.	1.1652011994943878
Everyone is free to choose their lifestyle.	0.7515934625067637
They should be able to do so without compromising their equal opportunities and equal treatment.	1.1799866851881715
In sport the saying goes, "Do not change a winning team."	1.0087241997206544
Why should we wish to change a system which is satisfactory?	1.122333053829948
The universal service will be able to fulfil its social mission only if it retains an area of monopoly enabling it to balance its budget.	1.0087439066348862
We cannot afford to make a mistake, for we know for a fact that we shall not be able to turn the clock back and that in the event of an imbalance, the firm will know how to tackle it: jobs will be lost, services will be reduced, the dead wood will be removed and we already know which areas will be considered dead wood.	1.3949464875598059
We are told we should change the limit from 350 grammes to 150 grammes, or even 50 grammes.	1.0686692694979407
So be it. But the 200 grammes that make up the difference will be seized upon by many private and therefore profitable bodies.	1.1818067915936814
So, once again, why not leave things as they are and allow the public service to fund itself and to guarantee the annual excess cost of its operations in the public interest, valued in France, by Senator Larcher, as it happens, at FF 8 billion?	1.342783742916446
If revenue is lost, then public interest operations will be revised and cut, and again it is in rural areas that the most swingeing cuts will be made.	1.4634350946071644
What we should do now, I feel, is wait, particularly until we know the economic and social impact of one phase of liberalisation before taking the risk of destabilising an entire section of our universal public service, which many of our fellow citizens still value highly.	1.4088402608264097
Mr President, I am one of those who agree that it is appropriate that this particular service should be regulated at European level.	1.2436262391848198
If people are to be free to provide services across borders it is only fair and reasonable that we should have European regulations to govern it.	1.281256516037402
In Ireland some services are provided by companies from outside Ireland, for example, English companies certainly operate there.	0.9866884765368379
But this directive has never been transposed into national law.	0.8615996070842421
It is the job of the Commission to ensure that national governments take account of their legal obligations under European law and transpose European directives.	1.3577772308507208
That has not been done in Ireland although a certain liberalisation has taken place and has not been impeded by the national government.	1.1331918077892602
A small segment of our market has been taken over by private operators.	0.9938626969864531
But the need for common legislation is underlined by the fact that in the Netherlands they have liberalised, in Germany they have not, yet German companies which enjoy the protection of national law seek to take market share in the Netherlands.	1.323727851203528
This is another example of the importance of moving forward with common legislation and ensuring that it is put into effect throughout the Union.	1.0572567374759345
I come from a rural area.	0.654740272935423
I support the principle of liberalising and the right of everybody to compete and I recognise the benefits that common regulation and liberalisation has brought over the years.	1.137894370843782
For example it has enabled us to fly from peripheral parts of the European Union to the centre for a fraction of the cost of 20 years ago.	1.1641342985232923
I remember when people came into this House lobbying us in the national interest not to allow this liberalisation.	1.0665877156425627
We allowed it and the result is that our young people can travel and broaden their education.	0.9352715388678051
Our older people, even though on social welfare, can enjoy the benefits of travel.	1.2453818186336139
So liberalisation has taken a lot of parasites off our back in many areas and enabled many people to enjoy higher standards of living.	0.994169439286833
On the other hand this is not a free market without limits and if you come from a rural area you recognise that some services in the free market situation cannot and will not be provided.	1.3442715694031728
So, the Commission, in bringing forward their new proposals, must remember those sparsely populated rural areas and not put anything in this legislation which will deprive those areas of the opportunities of having those services.	1.3552500719578686
In rural areas, for many years, even before the Irish Free State came into existence, we sometimes had this service of a post office.	1.2793772425291718
Today, it is probably the only public service in many remote areas and people are concerned that European legislation will eventually make it difficult to maintain it.	1.3002102792433883
I want to underline the fact that the existing legislation protects rather than threatens the right of every citizen in every remote area to have this service.	1.3720770346971496
But complaints are made by private individuals about social welfare being paid in the post offices in Ireland.	0.9740000556600139
I want the Commission to recognise that this is a necessary social service.	1.4830123401475954
It should go hand in hand with our postal services in rural areas.	0.9545037298141658
We must implement what the directive insists on, that the postal service is available to everybody.	1.3402173384850078
Mr President, Commissioner, besides the fact that the postal services doubtless play an extremely important part in providing employment, they are very helpful in the effort to achieve the cohesion we all want so much and which is a basic reason for the European Union' s existence.	1.5046031212910433
As is known, the Commission should already, before the end of 1998, have tabled new proposals for a revision of the Postal Services Directive 97/67, guaranteeing the continued provision of a universal service, securing its economic viability, and regulating the gradual liberalisation of the postal services market while taking into account the consequences of this for all those involved, including postal workers and customers.	1.284636526312712
To that end, the Commission has commissioned studies on the cost of universal services, the consequences of liberalising cross-border mail and direct mail, the consequences of reducing weight and cost limits in the reserved sector, the consequences of liberalising the other phases of the postal process, excluding distribution, and an overall appraisal of the results of those studies.	1.3545513118468322
Mr President, we are therefore wondering, and we ask the Commission - although, of course, Mr Bolkestein is not here, but Mr Monti is a man of many parts and I think he may have a view on this: should those studies not examine the economic and social impact of the various liberalisation scenarios envisaged on each, and I repeat, on each one of the European Union' s Member States?	1.6458856586338217
The postal services in Greece, Great Britain, the Netherlands or Belgium are, of course, all different.	1.3672275308670425
With liberalisation, how will it be possible for the universal postal service to be funded and to operate correctly in a country such as my own, Greece, with its particular geographical features and its numerous, small but inhabited islands?	1.172281681939784
How can a universal service provider in my country survive with the liberalisation of cross-border mail which amounts to approximately 25%, as opposed to less than 5% in other countries?	1.3396275252420695
How are we to deal with the transfer of the national post office' s business abroad?	1.1808717006665799
We have just heard Mr McCartin on the subject.	1.0217682145202438
It will most certainly be necessary, we say, because of the technological developments that simplify this transfer and thereby make it more profitable, to determine the further gradual and controlled liberalisation by setting weight and price limits.	1.2322585240138924
But what will those limits be?	0.744658064901069
Are we naively to grant 'freelance' enterprises the right to operate selectively and therefore circumvent the weight limit very easily since the content of letters cannot, of course, be checked?	1.0510802091555067
In any event, we ask the Commission to lay its cards on the table and put forward its proposals, having examined the ultimate foreseeable development of the matter from every aspect and for all the Member States.	1.2755532530325449
It is self-evident that liberalisation is not an end in itself, but only a means towards improving services.	1.0513889245644423
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the planned liberalisation of the traditional national postal services raises the inevitable question as to what the postal services will consider their core business to be in the future. In other words, what will the postal services be prepared to do themselves, what will they want to do together in international cooperation and what will they no longer provide?	1.3172020366196444
This question should be answered in light of the fact that the age-old monopoly has de facto been undermined by all kinds of courier companies and by technological developments, such as fax and e-mail.	1.0762836233192816
But then again, the central theme of the liberalisation of the postal services is employment.	1.0951706803558603
Past experiences have sufficiently shown that early retirement schemes and voluntary redundancy schemes often have an undesired effect.	0.8396413513701342
I would remind you of the fact that the Belgian telephone company had to recall employees who had been sent into retirement in order to prevent too much know-how and expertise from disappearing from the company.	1.1399614810986616
Once again, the point of discussion in the liberalisation of the postal services will no doubt be a reduction in the workforce.	1.2192460976629658
One should, however, be very aware of the fact that if people are encouraged to apply for voluntary redundancy, the company will primarily lose those people who already work under pressure or who can easily find employment elsewhere, in other words, they are often the people which the company in question needs.	1.2901106171425483
In my opinion, it would be a sign of well-thought-out human resource management if the Commission were to share a number of these concerns, so as to ensure that a sensitive sector such as the postal service is liberalised with minimum impact on social conditions.	1.201752251081017
Mr President, postal services and post offices seem to be very topical in Parliament at the moment and rightly so, given their importance.	1.485713353419063
Only last week, in the UK parliament at Westminster the newly-elected MP from our European Free Alliance partners, Plaid Cymru, the party of Wales, made his maiden speech on that subject.	1.289970789563077
The Scottish parliament too recently had a debate with particular reference to the role which post offices, especially in rural areas, play in service provision and the sustainability of rural communities.	1.131347004219422
Liberalisation is not the only potential threat to post office services.	1.1494175305848506
Post office outlets in Scotland, as we have heard, handle much more than just mail delivery.	1.1089942087755131
Traditionally they have been used by governments and some local authorities as an agency for the payment of state pensions and other benefits as well as a local collection centre for house rents, local taxes and so on. But as the modernisation of public financial systems leads to more and more electronic cash movements straight to and from bank accounts, so the viability of rural post offices is being threatened.	1.238957471528385
If a rural post office closes, usually with the only local shop attached, then a major threat to community sustainability and to social inclusion can result.	1.091725200978653
Instead of allowing post office outlets to be undermined by liberalisation or by the modernisation of systems, governments, and the Commission too, should be encouraging and supporting the extensive network of post office outlets and viewing these as an asset which can be built upon, providing public information and services from a location which is convenient for residents.	1.185559814018083
Mr President, the task of the post office is to ensure that, every day, the post is delivered everywhere, be it in the city or in remote, rural areas, at the same tariff.	1.297142771060176
For 150 years, the postal services have been a public affair and, as such, just like public transport and the power supply, a core task of the national governments.	1.6599623400198928
Such recognisable and useful core tasks give the electorate a reason to vote.	0.8008270140991086
They are much less interested in a government which takes no interest in these affairs.	0.9632880377939563
I once heard a Christian Democratic politician make the following comment in a Dutch village: "The postal service belongs to us all; taking it away from us is tantamount to theft" .	1.0880538695840416
The existing postal companies no longer fall under democratic control and room is being made for competitors.	1.175573155894772
The newcomers are only interested in those parts of the work that generate high profits at low cost and low prices.	0.9748084520641199
They can be the cheapest for a while only by means of a drop in quality for their customers and employees.	1.0798597782775776
Such companies have always been around, but they used to be banned, whereas these days they are being heralded as progress.	1.3416345551420141
The end result will be that existing companies will also be forced into bad practices.	0.9877931539543329
They will get their workforce to do more work at lower wages.	0.9221155028523346
They will often do fewer home deliveries, charge more for retaining post during the holidays, close down a large number of the post office branches and, ultimately, the tariffs for the individual will sharply increase, at which point the only parties which will stand to benefit from this type of practice will be companies which conclude collective agreements at a lower tariff.	1.1196694634059647
It is time we stopped this trend.	1.079202547284131
A fault confessed is half redressed.	0.5403948666824847
We are better off with one democratically controlled monopoly than the waste and chaos brought on by competition which cannot be controlled.	0.908683179886743
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, people used to be summoned to demonstrations by letter or telegram; nowadays this is done by e-mail and via websites!	1.0707406299067035
Incidentally, many thanks to Mr Scharping, the Chairman of the European Social Democrats, for withdrawing the call to take part in demonstrations in Austria from his homepage and therefore not advising anarchists in favour of violent action to go to Vienna tomorrow.	1.4787223074365452
It is clear that electronic mail, electronic commerce is going to become extremely important in the future.	1.0682188506700212
I also see this as offering special potential for the existing postal service.	0.9911578218416504
We know that until the year 2002 it will not be possible to fill some 1.2 million jobs in the field of electronic commerce because we do not have the skilled workers needed for this market.	1.199996195286793
I believe that this opens up very extensive employment potential in the postal administration in particular, which can prepare its existing staff for this very interesting challenge by means of training and further training measures.	1.3723683559502269
Of course the existing rural post offices also have a strategic advantage, because they are so densely distributed throughout Europe.	1.1168727432244057
Even the tiniest village has a post office and in future e-commerce will make far more use of the post because many people will order goods by e-mail and through websites and also send bills and so forth by that means. That is why the physical handling of these transactions will also become increasingly important.	1.2209510816542664
The collection, sorting, transportation and delivery of mail will take on an entirely new dimension.	0.9091366969373922
I believe that in future we must seize this opportunity.	1.0901814083859718
As politicians we must devote special attention to defending consumer interests.	0.7467522098607157
We want our consumers to obtain as much as possible for the wages they are paid.	1.0937866324364376
That faces us with the very important challenge of offering the consumers cheaper postal services.	1.014263582164362
We should take a look - thinking also of benchmarking - at what the consumer currently pays for an employee in the existing postal services and what he pays for an employee in the private sector.	1.1633257699831816
This transparency is also very important for the unions, for how can a union official who has to represent his members in a private company compete with a union official who has to represent his members in the postal service?	1.1346935940367833
I think it is important for the unions too to operate under uniform economic and social framework conditions so as to achieve the best results for their members on a basis of justice, fairness and solidarity.	1.175682635186201
But I also believe that in future we will have to make the universal service sufficiently attractive.	1.295778327981869
We should define the universal service precisely, establish efficiency criteria and then issue invitations to tender.	0.8688702570442752
In rural areas where we have real fears that these services really can no longer be cost-effective, I believe the decision should be taken by a regulator who can lay down fair and decent tendering conditions, so that all the market forces, and of course the existing postal services too, can compete here and so that we can pursue the best and most efficient consumer strategies.	1.4217544274582568
I believe we must avoid further subsidies and should try to ensure that the private supplier and the consumer benefit from the new system.	1.2148927977221295
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, postal services, just like any European public service, contribute to the social cohesion of Community territory under the terms of Article 16 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	1.126014875404037
By equalising tariffs, i.e. treating citizens and economic operators on a basis of strict equality with regard to the cost of the service, by meeting the obligation to provide a universal service, while complying with the requirement for quality of service, postal services reflect the concern which we must have to ensure equality between different regions and the people resident in them.	1.291242155703837
They also play a major role in maintaining links between people.	0.8783398840790958
As has been pointed out here on many occasions, is the postman not in fact the last point of contact in depopulated districts or divided communities, whether these are areas that are isolated geographically or the problem districts in our towns and cities?	1.321762634061059
Let me cite the example of the initiative of the French postal service, which decided, for instance, to make interpreters and writers available to the public in post offices in problem urban areas.	1.3246137181322022
Without even mentioning the jobs in related sectors, European public postal services today employ one and a half million operatives whose futures are clearly threatened by the spectre of radical, untrammelled liberalisation.	0.9725078061375911
The European Parliament was confident of reconciling openness to competition with the obligation to provide a universal service in a manner which safeguards jobs.	1.1445412836148876
We may congratulate ourselves on this, but we intend that this should continue and this is the reason why one can only deplore the fact that the European Parliament is today being excluded from the main decision-making process which will determine the fate of the postal sector in Europe.	1.5172830257118775
Indeed it is regrettable that to date - as the resolution we are debating points out - the Commission has not taken account of the resolution of 14 January 1999.	1.589068012949088
That resolution called for the European Parliament to be involved in drawing up the planned measures and urged that the reliability of impact studies regarding liberalisation should be improved.	1.047206412187851
These impact studies are necessary in order to assess the effects of any untrammelled liberalisation, not just on the economic organisation of the market, but also in terms of its human and social aspects.	1.2350097039199261
The delays in the Commission' s work will inevitably have a knock-on effect on the proposed timetable and the deadline of 2003 must certainly be called into question.	1.1077625985903976
By defining a sector reserved for public postal services, on the basis of weight and price limits, the postal service directive would clear the way for controlled liberalisation in phases.	1.1401225092131053
The sudden reduction of these limits poses a threat to the balance between the obligation to provide a public service and economic viability for postal services.	1.0267854296029975
Against a background of globalisation, where the rationale of profitability and profit is coming increasingly into conflict with the wish to achieve both a balance between regions and social cohesion, we must here, as a matter of urgency, reiterate our commitment to European public service, whether it be, today, the postal service or, tomorrow, the rail service or, the day after that, the health service.	1.3878950325562687
Mr President, I rise as other Scottish Members of this House, representatives of Scotland, to protest against anything that lead to a decline in the quality of rural life in remote parts.	1.22117087748463
The postal service and the post office are a vital feature of life in rural communities throughout Europe and not least in Scotland.	1.225972997629439
It would be a disaster if action were deliberately, or even inadvertently, taken which had the effect of damaging that.	1.2395008020008522
I do not believe that it is anybody' s intention to do so.	1.057382275513367
I do not believe that the Commission has set out to make war upon the islands of Scotland or Greece.	1.3897375657213786
But they might accidentally do great damage.	0.5984108766810768
The point is to determine at what speed and by what methods the gradual liberalisation of the postal services should take place.	1.0141826572853692
If too low a limit were set for the continuing monopoly right of the postal service, it would become uneconomical to maintain in the outlying areas universality of service at what would remain an affordable rate.	1.1894926453737682
The critical thing is to balance universality and affordability.	0.7480817080729709
The message that is coming very clearly from all sides of the House to the Commission today is that the Commission should tread warily.	1.4285648509194675
The Commission should not, for example, take a stepwise jump from 350 grammes to, as some have suggested, as low as 50 grammes.	1.4579052169131586
On the contrary, it should proceed cautiously.	1.2092562228491768
I imagine anything less than 150 grammes would be extremely unwise in these circumstances.	0.8975714833679963
The solidarity and cohesion of people all over Europe depend on the thought that you can post a letter anywhere and it will be delivered anywhere else, at an affordable stamp price.	1.2121587433096497
Stand by universality and affordability!	0.4232228959132205
Mr President, the only way to guarantee a high-quality universal postal service is to keep this as a public service.	1.4613625019865424
A universal service offering high-quality postal services at affordable prices throughout the country forms the basis for the operation of the whole postal system and must lead to a uniform nationwide tariff.	1.1397288784476332
This service must therefore be kept public.	0.817652895480917
This is the only way to guarantee that the network, from collection to distribution, will be a comprehensive network which cannot be broken up or used only in part and according to the convenience of postal service operators.	1.2699613243177472
However, further to the directive on common rules for Community postal services, the Commission has undertaken studies which have not been forwarded to the European Parliament. We are therefore unaware of the impacts of the directive' s application on either the level of service provided to the people or the current European postal operators in terms of both economics and employment.	1.5439101104072885
In our opinion, the whole process of applying this directive must therefore be halted, including its timetable.	1.3782579401370596
Any change to the current situation must be preceded by a rigorous study of its various implications, with the objective always being to guarantee a high-quality public service and to retain the current public operators and existing jobs.	1.1985387132837888
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to support this proposal on principle while asking right at the outset whether the previous speaker' s statement that on the one hand we need an innovative and highly effective and competitive service while on the other hand this service should be a public service, is not a contradiction in terms.	1.360302694773223
I think ours is a different approach!	0.8191010824541364
European policy has liberalised monopoly markets - energy, telecommunications and air transport - and the target, the focus, was always the consumer.	1.3764172698274348
The aim was simply to offer a better service and also to put the emphasis on the user in liberalising the postal services.	1.2027448180527023
I think the consumer can decide for himself and define in advance what he needs.	1.0101139760072646
He does not need a government to do so, or a parliament, nor does he need a Commission to do so!	1.5616015964716528
The postal market is limping along behind and, sadly, we have wasted valuable time here.	1.1848395615579395
I believe we should give the postal service a chance to adapt to new trends.	1.1825252979281586
I am thinking here of the very sound words of Mr Rübig, who also talked about e-commerce.	1.2886340082813652
That will develop very quickly and present the various undertakings in our society with new challenges; we will have to adapt very flexibly and rapidly to these challenges.	1.1063213934535496
I believe a liberalised market will speed up this process more than a less liberalised market.	1.025036135418584
It also offers some prospect of conveying a positive picture of European policy.	0.7870983660463698
We should seize that opportunity, for the citizen keeps asking, why do we have Europe?	1.1898620103922901
These are areas where the citizen can see and understand the benefit of Europe.	0.964090527183627
I am glad Mr Monti, the Commissioner for competition, is here today in person, for he is pursuing an excellent policy.	1.5724068974333687
And here I want to turn to an area where in my view - and this is a point also made in this debate - Parliament and the Commission must consider where to draw limits to competition.	1.6429480222126223
We are in favour of competition as a component of the social market economy, and of course we are also in favour of it because we want this economic system to be as successful as possible.	1.4164105536393707
Yet I believe that, as this debate has shown, we have to discuss the limits to competition in some areas.	1.6156706799161273
So I would ask you to give an impetus in that direction, together with Parliament.	1.1892405508097865
I have mentioned the example of social services before: nowadays we can reduce everything to attracting the customer, including the pensioner in an old people' s home, and the question is whether we want to subject all that to competition, whether that is the right course.	1.4553850183820927
I believe we should use this legislative term to determine the limits, the positive aspects of competition.	1.2511591870523495
For competition is not an end in itself; it is there to serve of the citizen, the consumer, which is why we should consider the areas in which we do not want it.	1.4736674238543253
Mr President, liberalising postal services could increase competitiveness in the postal sector and guarantee cheaper and more flexible services for the public; it could also address the challenges brought by modern technology.	1.2517490732082794
I emphasise the word 'could' , and that is if it is done well and with care.	1.258941050206442
Wrongly done, the threatening images that have been described here will certainly become a reality.	1.0981261079928986
Social problems will increase, interregional disparities will grow, and competition will occur only in those areas where the economy is strongest, areas where there are more people and, especially, more businesses.	1.3571983947469453
On the other hand, the losers will be the remote areas and their inhabitants, and the people that will not benefit from the new services.	1.3473095007911682
Before we decide whether to liberalise postal services, there should be much more discussion about how we can make the present services more flexible and more customer-friendly, and how funding systems can facilitate the investments called for by the new technology.	1.25434310530902
I think this policy has been reasonably successful in Finland, as testified by the present public system.	1.2762870793853829
I think, however, that common rules have to be applied to this sector, so that we do not find ourselves at some stage somewhere out in the Wild West, or even the Wild East. We need rules in common based on equality and the principle of a public service.	1.4125097782155145
Mr President, a precise assessment of the effects of the first directive is the least we can ask for when approaching the future of the public postal service.	1.4619839421321046
It would be obscene to wish to settle the fate of hundreds of thousands of postal workers, millions of service users, in a great rush.	1.2327922808259062
But, despite the unfavourable opinion of ten European postal services, a form of unacknowledged privatisation is brewing in the corridors of the Commission.	1.084990674291316
By lowering the price/weight threshold reserved for public postal services and by liberalising mailshots or cross-border post, the second directive may offer the most profitable sectors to the competitive sector.	1.150597600250714
Postal services may then keep whatever does not whet the appetite of the private operators.	0.8588290497788091
Whether total or partial, privatisation will only make an already dismal situation worse.	0.8406493634024463
Just the example of the privatisation of British rail services should suffice to prove the extent to which opting for maximum profit is antipathetic to maintaining a socially useful service.	0.9276664448856508
Instead of fighting amongst themselves, public postal services should cooperate, take staff on and guarantee decent, stable working conditions, while meeting the needs of service users in terms of both post delivery and savings bank services.	1.1899002309329427
Mr President, today' s debate comes under the sign of the snail, not because I ate such excellent snails here in Strasbourg yesterday but because the snail is a symbol of slow progress.	1.2008700237343983
One example of this slow progress is the way the Commission is proceeding.	1.4209977719207225
This study is taking far too long and we feel it is important to speed up the pace at last.	1.200886784359016
I am most grateful to the Commissioner for his plain talking today and I would ask the Commission to force the pace now.	1.372876469376971
Today' s debate makes it quite clear that Parliament wants more emphasis on speed, not speed at the expense of quality, but then slowness alone does not mean quality either.	1.3617936298728308
This brings me to my second point, namely the snail as symbol of our postal services.	1.1616599088483481
What has happened over the past 200 years is that the time it takes for a letter to go from Munich to Brussels has increased fivefold.	1.195095931415423
Letters to Strasbourg arrive there a bit sooner, but it still takes far too long.	1.1795325259094893
That means that since the days of mail-coaches and taxis, we have seen a steady decline in the quality of services.	1.1878503316617204
It may be true, as was said here, that today we have new possibilities, e.g. electronic possibilities such as e-mail, but on the other hand we must realise that as ever the ordinary letter continues to play a very, very important role and that, in particular, young families, the elderly and many others continue to rely very heavily on conventional mail.	1.3965173213409836
So I believe that in relation to conventional mail we must do what Mr Radwan described in such excellent terms, namely encourage competition on the one hand and on the other, define the limits.	1.2708868698581233
But what we have often seen in recent years was the very opposite!	1.3694275869094825
By embarking on the kind of pseudo and partial privatisations we have also witnessed in Germany, we have combined the drawbacks of the state monopoly with the drawbacks of privatisation, which is really not the purpose of the whole exercise!	1.3518759908469598
Some speakers have referred to the social importance of the postman. Let me add to that, the importance of the post offices.	1.5196326622237928
They have referred to rural and sparsely populated areas.	0.6418748991929945
I come from Munich, a very densely populated urban conglomeration, but we have the same problem there.	1.5694433924648594
One urban district post office after another is being closed down.	0.7909321426923072
We have a disproportionately large number of old people in these large cities, who are becoming increasingly lonely with the decline in the number of retail shops.	1.2017661233831338
That is why we must define certain minimum standards here too and realise that it is important to provide the necessary services for the people.	1.410450783272379
For if there is only one letter box left in the inner city of Munich where the mail is collected again in the evening, that reflects a rapid decline in quality, while at the same time prices are sometimes rising, which is something else we must note.	1.2422522359193964
So, yes to liberalisation, but let us also think about the limits to liberalisation, rapidly create reasonable conditions in Europe and submit the appropriate study to the Commission.	1.2178902492614774
I would hope that in future the symbol of European postal policy will no longer be the snail but that our post will finally be dispatched post-haste.	1.1601261470029491
That is a term that harks back to the time when the post was still the symbol of speed.	1.1593524248288105
Like Mr Radwan, I am glad that Commissioner Monti is here rather than Commissioner Bolkestein because I believe that he can explain to us certain aspects relating to competition.	1.2866250993759998
I do not know if Mr Monti is aware of the judgement of the Court of Justice of the European Communities of last week, 10 February, which recognised the possibility of the German postal service being in a dominant position as a result of its holding a postal monopoly.	1.4663735401808689
Competition policy will no doubt have to be applied to this sector before the coming liberalisation - before 1 January 2003 - because at the moment the tendency is to divert mail via countries with lower postage rates.	1.3573755174797975
This has consequences for free competition between the different postal administrations.	0.9807164804981139
In the event that liberalisation is brought about throughout the European Union, what consequences would that have for free competition?	1.3102586225776174
For the moment, it appears that, in the only country where liberalisation has taken place - Sweden - there has been a 59% increase in the price of postal services.	1.4575890306513672
We do not know what will happen in each of the countries where liberalisation is going to take place.	1.2775641406235487
It is likely that postal liberalisation will lead to greater cost differences between countries, which will no doubt have implications for competition, which will not only affect the cost of the postal service but also the establishment of installations.	1.418951764557906
For example, there are currently companies which set up in Holland because the postal charges are lower than in Germany and the same may happen in the future.	1.2338284273983233
I therefore wonder whether the Commission' s package on postal liberalisation will include the preservation of free competition, because it is very possible that - as has happened in most sectors in the Community today - it will lead to concentrations of large companies which will cancel out the benefits of this theoretical liberalisation.	1.2669063333184787
At the moment, in services which are not theoretically liberalised - as is the case with national postal services - there is a basic form of liberalisation, which is agreed within the framework of the Universal Postal Union, allowing for lower tariffs.	1.5020296254936407
In a service which is theoretically liberalised, free competition may disappear as a result of the concentration of the service amongst large companies abusing their dominant position, agreements between companies and other similar circumstances.	1.1374701971023162
I would therefore advise Commissioner Monti to deal with the issue of postal liberalisation, taking strict account of free competition, because I believe that this will probably become a very worrying issue in the future.	1.299857142213104
My prediction is that the liberalised postal services will probably be much less competitive than the current public postal services.	1.0377274813386297
Mr President, the postal service is not a normal service provider like a hairdresser' s or a fitness centre.	1.1713760282601382
For us in Finland, a sparsely populated country, a visit to the post office is a social event.	1.4610260654970961
In the world of networking, the mail service is the most democratic of all networks.	1.4707948864780038
It creates and maintains interpersonal relationships.	0.5697166571308885
The common market in postal services will be created on the terms of the marketeers.	1.1828164249381559
For us in the north it will mean that the EU will be destroying the social infrastructure.	1.2585942448301977
Commissioner Monti, the principle of competition cannot be applied to interpersonal relationships: postal services must be improved, not run down.	1.3598887826655686
Only a public mail service can guarantee that information technology is within everyone' s reach in society.	0.8643350767594168
The post office is democracy.	0.7126730591811147
It is better suited to handling such matters than telecommunications companies.	0.8691472321869522
Telecommunications costs have risen as a consequence of companies being bought and sold and marketing costs accounting for more than 50% of companies' turnover.	1.0196427956692278
Democratic investments have to be made to preserve a democratic post office.	1.2282628752874518
It is particularly appropriate that Mr Monti is responding to this debate because the great conundrum with postal services is how to square an open market and free and fair competition with providing a service which is universally available to all, even in the remotest and least inhabited region of the European Union.	1.1823006353781458
In the hills and glens of Scotland and the rural borders and central belt, on the beautiful but fragile islands of the Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland, there is real concern at possibly losing this essential service.	1.120630254280374
Yet we all know that service quality can only improve if postal services, like all service industries, are given the financial and management freedom of the private sector and the spur of open, even international, competition.	1.3187168846850468
I would suggest that there is a solution.	1.1614647362349497
It is already employed widely in the transport sector.	1.0455252643319617
Air routes, ferry routes, train routes, bus routes, within and to these remoter areas are put out to tender. The bidder who offers to provide the specific service at a specific quality level and at the lowest subsidy level gets the contract.	1.1038421319203975
Let us call this a negative tender franchise.	0.8276517479408315
This permits desirable competition in providing these services under a publicly-supported but fully transparent franchise system.	0.8033191606589403
Why could not mail collection and delivery in a certain region be put to negative tender in this manner?	1.0430262270124164
The lowest subsidy would win the franchise for a certain period of time.	0.9044344360085657
Why could not the sub-post office in a remote village also be put out to this sort of negative tender?	0.9428132492050001
It would therefore be up to the appropriate democratically accountable government body, local, regional or national - probably under overall EU supervision - to set the service criteria and the financial resources for meeting this particular social purpose.	1.3631698838864956
Otherwise the postal services can be left to all the demands and constraints of the marketplace.	1.13319339560991
Mr President, Commissioner, it is no coincidence that I am the fifth Member of this House from Scotland to rise to speak in this debate.	1.336783354714494
That is a measure of the importance to us of our postal services.	1.3544981528050282
Scotland as a country is larger than some Member States.	0.8072574781683588
It has many remote mainland communities accessible only by road, sometimes served poorly by public transport, sometimes not at all.	1.0960920462351984
Such communities rely for their survival on having local facilities, such as a school, a post office and a shop.	1.1596537894349501
It is on the last two that the elderly, in particular, depend.	1.3521045024628844
Often they are located together, each service being made more viable by the existence of the other.	1.17375701387907
Scotland also has many island communities, some of which can be reached by air but most of which depend on sea ferries.	1.0729150157978689
It has been calculated that the actual cost of carrying a letter from Edinburgh to the Central Highlands is about ten times that of carrying the same letter across London.	1.018686378242711
And it is about four times the postage cost actually charged.	1.0826284243302833
The more remote the community, the greater the difference becomes.	1.1612007711642165
That is the measure of the problem.	1.097780539113193
It is not to oppose liberalisation to ask that it be done in a way that takes account of these factors and allows the continuation of a universal and affordable postal service.	1.2935490695768765
It is for all our remote and island communities, no matter where in the European Union they are situated, and not just for the people of Scotland, that I ask you to preserve the vital lifeline that their postal services provide.	1.4894516626159595
. Mr President, I consider it a privilege that I am replacing my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, on the occasion of such a high-quality debate on postal services.	1.293566316348258
I will try to respond to the debate on the basis of information provided by Commissioner Bolkestein.	1.097325296621531
May I repeat that on Monday he will be available to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of Parliament.	1.032612058968905
Some Members, like Mr Stenmarck, complain that there have been delays with the new proposal.	1.107348555995085
Others believe that it is not so bad after all, if there is a slight pause after the first step of liberalisation.	1.4431549281957246
This is, for example, the position expressed by Mr Berthu.	1.0944555780283962
The Commission' s position is that the new proposal was delayed mainly owing to the internal problems of the Commission, of which I am sure Parliament is not totally unaware.	1.6424835644949052
But we feel that there is a legal obligation for a proposal to be made.	1.3596399510344408
It is Commissioner Bolkestein' s intention to present such a proposal to the Commission for adoption in the first half of this year.	1.2519952856777383
The scheduled date of 1 January 2003 for implementation of the next steps remains feasible.	1.1517598043640325
The proposal will take account of the studies undertaken and in particular look at such issues as universal service, to which I will come back in a second.	1.3530350411272327
As regards the existing directive and its implementation, most Member States have taken the necessary legal measures to transpose the directive.	1.3151457513690574
A number of problems exist as regards the structure of the regulator and its independence.	1.0507369994680362
The implementation deadline for the Member States is January 2003.	1.0248492865979122
Further liberalisation will occur afterwards.	0.6121544891519711
In some areas competition is already taking place, as in the parcels sector and in the express services.	1.2456982589576395
The quality of services has, generally speaking, improved, in particular in regard to cross-border activity.	1.3382045389853026
The quality of services, which is so relevant to consumers, was a main concern of all speakers, some of whom, like Mr Rübig, were very explicit on this point.	1.4865716332954506
The experiences in countries where liberalisation is more advanced such as Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands, prove that when liberalisation takes place in an orderly way, the quality of service may be raised as a result of higher-quality service requirements imposed by the national regulations and their follow-up.	1.2333615250785865
So this is not a selling-out of the service and of its quality.	1.5058888956149312
Frequently liberalisation leads to guaranteed standards and the on-going standardisation of the measurement of the quality of service also contributes, as these standards will better reflect actual performance.	1.0981103954885973
This will allow for meaningful bench-marking and improved customer orientation by the incumbent operator as a result of the combined pressure by regulators, competitors and customers.	0.9485923073389463
We can see in the incumbent operators, in public post offices, a change of culture that I believe nobody can consider negative if the current trend towards concentrating on customers' needs continues.	1.3015787470955862
The concerns expressed in this Parliament this morning by honourable Members will be at the core of the activity of my colleague and of the Commission as a whole in the preparation of the further proposal.	1.3083246085211873
That proposal will fully take into account the need to ensure universality of service, the development of efficient safeguards for consumers, and the creation of a climate which would be favourable to new jobs - not to fewer jobs - in the framework of a progressive, gradual evolution.	1.470663126565417
The issue of universal service was mentioned by Mrs Isler Béguin, by Mr Miller, whom I thank for his personal message, and by many others.	1.4069491869135806
We are all aware of the extremely important aspect of social and structural cohesion, especially in the sparsely populated rural areas, one of which has been particularly strongly and overwhelmingly represented in the debate this morning.	1.2766141218418263
We believe that the universal service is a pillar and I am sure that my colleague will be able to provide reassurances to the appropriate parliamentary committee.	1.370861875819051
Mrs Gillig, but others like Mr Markov and Mr Ésclope, voiced concerns about employment.	1.138808412892178
Experience in other sectors show a sort of U-curve pattern: a phase of reduction in employment starts just before liberalisation takes place, as, of course, the incumbent prepares itself to be competitive; then a second phase of steady employment, as new jobs in newcomer operators balance further potential employment reductions; finally, a third phase of net job creation, both in the incumbent and new operators as the benefits of liberalisation reach users and the market develops more quickly.	1.205811872797787
In the postal sector the first phase is already in progress, as the universal service providers have embarked on a process of modernisation.	1.32733181530814
The new technologies and logistics rather than the process of postal liberalisation are the most important factors impacting on employment.	1.2469637713950756
On the availability of the studies, - a point raised by Mr Staes and others - copies of each of the studies were handed to Parliament in September 1999.	1.2846126377257059
They have all been available on the Commission' s Internet website since August 1999 and the Commission is willing to provide copies to anybody who is interested.	1.100596918958236
The studies have been the object of some criticism, especially on the part of the public postal services.	1.140456770320866
I am aware that all the studies launched experienced difficulty in collecting adequate data.	0.9851850489481443
This was no surprise, since the universal service operators do not always have the systems in place for detailed letter collection.	1.1632756931680681
Does that not say a lot about management ability?	0.9981980602078033
No single methodology for accessing the cost and financing of the universal service is accepted by all the parties.	1.0967979019201106
Nevertheless, Mr Bolkestein is convinced that the studies undertaken provide enough clarity and precision to form the basis of the decision-making process.	1.2544663502679343
I finally come to three interventions about a subject I am supposed to know better than postal services, that is competition.	1.1241067882748543
Mr Purvis, I found your methodologically provocative remark about the tender interesting and certainly worth exploring.	1.0567569295219743
Mr Medina Ortega, I am as convinced as you are that we must be even more vigilant after liberalisation, because we do not want the disappearance of public monopolies to give rise, through unchecked concentration, to private operators.	1.460028984118853
This applies both to the post and other sectors.	0.988761006392749
If I can provide one example of this sort of vigilance, it is the case of Deutsche Post where, following complaints and an action before the court, the Commission initiated a formal state aid procedure in July.	1.4923463020185195
We have just received the reply of the German Government to the observations made.	1.2454762425806114
The state aid procedure covers the question of cross-subsidisation between monopoly letter services and commercial business parcel activities as well as the financing of Deutsche Post' s numerous recent acquisitions.	1.1308740200701184
I will not go into the details due to lack of time, but this is perhaps one illustration of the fact that the Commission does not stop its work as liberalisation progresses.	1.2835857377341933
In a sense this is where its work begins.	1.1370210606836024
Finally, Mr Radwan, of course, there should be limits to competition and there are limits to competition.	1.346103227776694
In particular, if we take the issue of competition and services of general interest, where a Member State defines a mission of public service, it is important to quantify the costs for discharging that mission and state aids that compensate for those costs are certainly not a violation of competition.	1.4107510526731202
I would slightly disagree with the terminology you used when you said, Mr Radwan, that it is time for the needs of citizens to be taken into account rather than exclusively the need for competition.	1.2147298741013315
That concept I reject firmly, because competition is there for the citizens, and for them alone.	1.5022382822716853
Most companies hate competition.	0.4421284384677081
Competition is run and managed in the interest of the citizens, their economic interest and for their liberty.	1.1844628535806625
The examples of liberalisation and competition in air transport and in telephony services in Europe show that citizens have benefited from this.	0.9629960436352656
I can only say again that Commissioner Bolkestein will be able to address all the concerns on Monday, in the appropriate committee, more competently and in much more detail.	1.445878679931915
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	0.47513528222732565
Pursuant to Rule 42(5), I have received a motion for a resolution to close the present debate.	1.41497726087802
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
We shall now proceed to the vote.	0.16783221255831815
(Parliament adopted the resolution) EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE	0.8849385399606096
We voted in favour of the resolution because we received a request to this effect from a French postal service trade union which was looking to obtain, in the event of a favourable vote, an additional time frame in which to defend employees.	1.3162697937445176
This does not mean that we approve the entire contents, which are too vague and which leave out the main concern.	1.294092593590756
The policy undertaken by the European institutions and by national governments, especially the French government, is a retrograde policy, counter to the interests of both the service users, i.e. the great majority of the population, and the postal service workers.	1.4866955415858605
Postal services must continue to be public services.	0.8670254497102731
All people, regardless of their location or social status, must have access to the postal service on an equal footing and subject to the same conditions.	1.2653358588368513
In organising the public service no consideration must be given to the idea of profitability, and private firms must not be authorised to amass private profits by carrying off the most profitable public service activities.	1.1820515072810005
Consequently, the post office and its equivalents in the various countries of Europe must keep their monopoly of this service.	1.4086971573404168
In order to ensure that we have proper postal services on the European Union level, it is essential to put an end to the policy of closing down local post offices, reducing the number of deliveries and overworking postal staff.	1.25047104663322
The post office and, more generally, all public services must, on the other hand, recruit additional staff.	1.2074468596344123
Such jobs are unquestionably useful, and creating an adequate number of them would reduce unemployment in Europe.	1.1046140786877334
Mr President, personally I voted in favour of this resolution, because the essential thing is that the European Parliament should discuss the postal service and we should get away from the current ambiguous situation.	1.5774263106454387
If we dismantle the public service, this would be very serious, and we wish to know what are the Commission' s intentions.	1.6189967098019336
Saying that the client will receive a better service at a lower cost is patently inaccurate.	1.034776427320428
People who live a long way from civilisation will clearly not receive a better service or else they will then have to pay a great deal and some of them will not be in a position to do so.	1.3262790284311643
Postal services do not provide simply a postal delivery service but also a social service.	1.0099179185629539
Occasionally for some people the postman is the only person they see all day.	1.244291050142064
We can salute them, these postmen who, whatever the weather, sometimes walk for miles to be able to offer this service to everyone.	1.200968780474521
Dismantling the postal service, the local communication service, would be a serious mistake and we would be unable to maintain the principle of the equality of all citizens.	1.4526714697979626
Profitability at all costs means going against fraternity and against social cohesion.	0.8853227360582326
Mr President, I voted for the resolution and should like to explain my motives.	1.3814781962347238
Several speakers mentioned that the only person with whom many elderly people have any contact is the postman, particularly in mountain communities.	1.225253971082836
I wholeheartedly agree.	0.44014592694619137
However, it also seems to me that the pensions of many elderly people are being reduced as a result of national budget constraints.	1.4559451316164138
In my own country, Italy, there are some 200 000 postal workers who cost the state approximately ITL 50 million a year per capita, or EUR 25 000, that is, a total cost of around EUR 5 million.	1.1757073470237598
Liberalisation of postal services would mean that the state could give each pensioner an extra ITL 10 million a year so that a million pensioners would see their pensions doubled.	1.019661836352952
That should amply compensate them for forgoing their contact with the postman.	0.6829405460488946
Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution on European postal services with all the more satisfaction since it reiterates once again the position I have always defended in this House, which is the need for a high quality universal service, particularly ensuring this service in the least populated regions and rural regions, and there are some even in my small country, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.	1.4952447179453
In these regions but also in some districts of towns and cities, as Mr Posselt explained so clearly, post offices and postmen have an almost socio-cultural role, I might say, which goes beyond merely delivering mail.	1.3367359594219184
I know that this service is unprofitable.	1.0583274726571306
It would perhaps be less costly to make a fax or email available to isolated houses or villages.	0.9598972887915453
In principle, I am in favour of abolishing public sector monopolies, whether in water, gas, electricity, telephone, satellite, cable or any other services.	1.0611627915627329
Nonetheless, liberalisation, which has a lot to offer to the consumer in terms of the price and the quality of the service, especially in the telephone sector, must cease as soon as the service provided becomes inadequate or disappears, when the firms profiting from liberalisation are not making money.	1.4591089095240002
If they cannot be obliged to provide what the state monopoly was able to guarantee, particularly thanks to its obligation to provide a universal service, then the public service must be protected.	1.3109937431865164
I feel we can still afford to maintain a postal service, even if our post offices operate like businesses.	1.2250392413992621
They clearly have to make some effort so that they are no longer described as snail mail even if they cannot attain the speed of email.	1.2383877304685273
.	-0.0
(FR) Here indeed is a sector which has highlighted the limitations and serious deficiencies of liberalisation.	1.0224373327716987
I am not, personally, a blinkered militant in favour of monopolies, whether public or private, but when I see the results achieved by private firms in this sector I am reinforced in my position as a defender of public service!	1.389827954527425
If liberalisation continues in this area too, then there is a great risk that one day we will see entire regions with no postal service.	1.4891747749870492
For who can believe for one moment that private firms, motivated only by profit, will continue to provide services in high-cost areas unless the costs are borne by the already disadvantaged inhabitants who are not, therefore, in a position to take advantage of the service.	1.2319258555741992
I should add that today, at a time when Europe is revealing itself and is proving to be incapable of opposing the inclusion of Fascists in a government within the European Union, it is no longer acceptable to have an ultraliberalism which destroys public services foisted on us in the name of this same Europe.	1.2035519251170659
I am a European and even a federalist.	1.2510910354621443
To achieve this I was ready and I am ready to make certain sacrifices, but not just anything! Most especially, I am no longer ready to accept the formation of a liberal single market if Europe is not at the same time capable of defending the values on which it is based and which, in the 1960s, made me a committed European!	1.462273780597093

Parliament has completed the agenda.	0.5276035019585842

Resumption of the session	0.13474910339249976
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 18 February 2000.	0.826632055101068
Statement by the President	0.5336908263689515
Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, on 22 February, ETA struck again in a brutal attack in Spain with the murder of Fernando Buesa Blanco, the General Secretary of the Socialist Party of Vizcaya and the spokesman of the Socialist Party of the Basque Parliament, and Jorge Díez Elorza, his bodyguard.	1.32352717267467
The same day, I conveyed my own and the European Parliament' s deepest sympathy and sincere condolences to the victims' families.	1.0281324065033528
These men paid with their lives for their commitment to democracy.	0.8006698670456532
I utterly condemn this act of barbarism that is unworthy of any civilised society.	0.7794840465137943
The rule of law and the respect of rights and fundamental freedoms are the principles on which the European Union is based.	1.3317348088153376
Terrorism, whatever form it takes, is unacceptable.	1.3687438250321502
In expressing the hope that these men will be the last victims of ETA, I call on this organisation finally to cease resorting to violence and to use the democratic channels that exist in Spain.	1.2726337527375093
I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to observe one minute' s silence in memory of Fernando Buesa Blanco and Jorge Díez Elorza.	1.0418420426034392
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)	0.3436815902905627
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I want to thank you for your statement last Tuesday and for your words today in memory of Fernando Buesa Blanco.	1.0085412356849826
He was a member of the Basque regional parliament, spokesman for the Socialist Party in that parliament and also a former vice-president of the Basque regional government.	1.4141064113418036
Madam President, the best tribute that my Group and this House can pay to Fernando Buesa is to take on board his vision, as a European, of the Basque Country, Spain and Europe.	1.5336905397027851
The following is a translated extract from his autobiography. 'We are in Europe.	1.1075073416246992
Anyone of my age - I am 54 - can remember their grandparents' era and their parents' era and, of course, is living in the current era. We can also see into the era in which our children will live.	1.4360059438465436
In my grandparents' time, it took several days to travel from Vitoria to Seville.	1.1204874454310565
Now you can go from Vitoria to Copenhagen in 2 or 3 hours by plane.	0.8201267064858224
Today, at the end of the 20th century, a single market is operating in Europe in which we will soon be using a single currency.	1.3792171934274047
We can now travel much more easily than our grandparents could within Spain or even within the Basque Country.	0.953470574767179
We are building a vast European area which will firstly be linked economically and then politically.	1.003074460506255
This process may take a long time but it is unstoppable and, what is more, desirable.	1.1803653464270691
The public still regard this as being a long way off but it is very real and should serve to make us question certain aspects of our current situation.	1.3040100251967948
In a debate within the Socialist Party on the Irish process, someone said: "In the end, the key to the Irish solution was that everyone involved had the following thought: does it really matter whether we are Irish or British?	1.2000440526741494
Everyone can be what they want to be because, if Ireland and Britain are both in the European Union, there is no point in killing each other for being Irish or British.	1.3246566592710458
What difference does it make if the national level is no longer going to function?"	1.0576641701037863
We in the Basque Country could ask ourselves the same question. Does it really matter if we are Basque or Spanish or European?	1.1847229679362647
We have talked a lot about what it is to be Basque, but a Basque today dresses like a Dane and reads the same things as a British person.	1.1681334521690891
If life is going to be lived on a much more global basis, as is already happening, and our children will therefore be living in the Europe which we are creating, why are we killing each other for being Basque or Spanish?'	1.3927050233193636
Fernando Buesa also said the following, which everyone in Ireland has probably thought. 'If we are killing each other for no reason - and this was happening in Ireland because there were paramilitary groups on all sides - we should be resolutely asking ourselves this question in the Basque Country too.	1.367548063042207
What difference does it make to be Basque? Surely it is all the same thing.	1.1135934772447964
You can be what you want to be.	1.1496274700253952
If, in the future, economics and politics and vital decisions for each country are dealt with in the European arena, there is no point killing or dying for being Basque or Spanish' .	1.232785266874469
May he rest in peace.	0.535251031331896
(Loud applause)	0.04062958545577951
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats, I want to express our most profound feeling of solidarity with the families of Fernando Buesa, an elected representative of the Basque people, and Jorge Díez, a member of the Basque police force. We also naturally want to express our solidarity with the whole of the Basque Socialist Party.	1.3299194012978826
In recent times, in this House, we have sadly had to discuss the various faces of extremism in Europe.	1.3521505167813788
It does not matter what banner these come under because, in the end, they are all different expressions of the same thing.	1.1900063459761885
Faced with these, we democrats cannot resign ourselves to the peace of the dead.	1.1798338148742609
On the contrary, we must take strength from knowing that the only social division which exists in the Basque Country is the abyss which separates those who kill, and those who support and express understanding for the latter, from the vast majority of the Basque people who simply want to live in peace and freedom.	1.2639518362639324
(Loud applause)	0.04062958545577951
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I must indicate my complete and categorical condemnation of the terrorist attack on 22 February in Vitoria which took the lives of the socialist MP and spokesman in the Basque parliament, Fernando Buesa, and his bodyguard, Jorge Díez.	1.0302005813954163
In a country governed by the rule of law and which is a member of the European Union, it should be possible for all ideas and options to be defended, provided that this occurs democratically and with respect for the rights of the individual and the principles and values of justice, freedom and economic and social progress on which the Union is based. The transgression of these principles is simply not acceptable, as clearly indicated in the Treaties.	1.416864702223962
There is no justification in our society for terrorist acts such as the one which took the lives of Fernando Buesa and Jorge Díez, particularly when the former was a freely elected representative of the Basque people.	1.2648388416610534
We pray that these are the last victims in a process which, as you said, Madam President, has seen much barbarism. We pray that a way forward can be found which will allow the Basque people to live together in peace.	1.489610161460328
Madam President, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, I must add my voice to those of my colleagues who have expressed their grief at the truly perverse and cruel outrage which has occurred in the Basque Country. We send our condolences to the families of the victims and emphatically condemn these acts which have been going on for so long and which must stop.	1.2115739331062678
The terrorist organisation ETA has, in its time, killed police officers and soldiers.	1.3244807417037767
It has placed a bomb in a supermarket and killed men, women and children.	0.8643113297653071
In the streets of Madrid it has killed a general, Quintana Lacaci, who defended democracy at the time of the attempted coup of 1981.	1.1876589546654683
It has assassinated the spokesman of the Popular Party in the town council of San Sebastián, Gregorio Ordóñez.	0.8428701802910449
It has been to the lecture room of the university professor in Constitutional Law, Francisco Tomás y Valiente, and killed him in cold blood. Now, just a few days ago, in the same odious way in which it assassinated Admiral Blanco, it has killed the socialist MP and spokesman in the Vitoria parliament, Fernando Buesa, and his bodyguard, Jorge Díez, of the Basque police force.	1.3067446045783497
ETA must be condemned. However, those who support and express understanding for these attacks must also be condemned.	1.1569601034863728
There is no point continuing to ask these people and organisations to go down the democratic road.	1.20279370122623
We must appeal to the whole of society and particularly to the democratic parties, whether they are national or nationalist, and no matter how pro- or anti-European they are.	1.3374197948687492
It is regrettable that there are organisations and people who are saying nothing or simply regretting the deaths as if they were the result of a road traffic accident.	1.144306237603587
All European democrats in this House must join together to send a message to the Basque Country that it is time to put an end to the division and killing. It is time to share the Basque Country, Spain and Europe.	1.2950670045628807
This, Madam President, is the only way forward which we therefore fully support.	1.3567664437634919
Madam President, on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group, I would like to express our sorrow for the victims and our rejection of terrorism and those who defend it.	1.2086637604494912
For the friends and relatives of the victims this is a human tragedy and for their political families it is a political tragedy, but I feel that we are also witnessing a cultural tragedy, in that the culture of death and of violence is constantly gaining ground against the culture of respect for others, democracy and democratic life.	1.4846693228232626
So, Madam President, maybe we should consider taking some action if we want our sorrow and our rejection of terrorism to have any actual significance.	1.2447910063353225
Why does Parliament not meet in all the countries of the European Union and show that it rejects terrorism?	1.2731058991991284
Let us make ourselves heard!	0.6988684195843365
We are not just confined to Brussels or Strasbourg.	1.0510223865727428
Let us all go back to our respective nations and shout from the rooftops that our belief in democracy and our indignation are not just words, but a demonstration of our actual political commitment.	1.22933117727162
Madam President, as a member of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and also as an MEP for the Basque Nationalist Party, I must firstly categorically condemn the cowardly attack which took the lives of a Basque police officer, Jorge Díez Elorza, and the Basque MP and former vice-president, Fernando Buesa.	1.2930172834009321
Secondly, we send our deepest condolences to their families, their socialist colleagues, the Basque parliament and the Basque police force. We also want to express our solidarity and heartfelt sympathy.	1.3987548314179634
Thirdly, we denounce the extreme nature of an attack which, by being perpetrated against an elected representative of the people, not only violated human dignity and human rights but also showed absolute contempt for the will of these people.	1.3559442349284465
Fourthly, we express our repulsion at the fact that this dual assassination was intended to directly destroy the political process aimed at achieving peace in the Basque Country.	1.1559816934140705
Fifthly, we again call on the Spanish and French leaders and politicians to show the same tolerance as in the United Kingdom and Ireland in order to resolve the current Basque conflict with something more than police measures which, on their own, cannot bring about the peace which we all desire.	1.47399648202417
Sixthly and finally, we reaffirm that ETA' s terrorism and violence must end. ETA must stop hijacking the will of the Basque people who must be allowed to decide on their future freely and without violent coercion.	1.1500091518876068
Just three months ago I took the floor in this House to congratulate the Irish and British people on their success in reaching the Northern Ireland settlement, as many other colleagues did.	1.4454615782206337
In Northern Ireland in the last thirty years too many people have been killed and injured - too many families shattered.	1.266575902021963
So far, unfortunately, in Spain and France, just the opposite has been happening as regards the on-going conflict in the Basque country.	1.2317982449479044
We, Euskal Herritarrok, are convinced that a definitive solution to the present struggle can only be found through an open process of dialogue and negotiation with no limited agenda.	1.2008934620369518
Before 20 January last, during nineteen months, the only killing we witnessed in the Kingdom of Spain was that of José Luis Geresta, member of ETA, in March 1999.	1.3951033046246
In spite of that and the arrests made by the Spanish and French police, including arrests of ETA negotiators with the Spanish government' s agreement, ETA honoured its unilateral ceasefire.	1.236155367480503
Then, last November, before the ceasefire was over, the Spanish Government spokesman, Mr Piqué, declared that his government had done and would in the future do everything possible to hinder present moves towards a political solution in the Basque country.	1.3152984817997477
We, Euskal Herritarrok, have regretted many times the loss of human lives.	1.0282812994245292
We share with all the Basque citizens the sufferings of our people.	0.8781280774310114
We are committed to dialogue and ready to work together with all those eager to find a democratic settlement for the Basque country.	1.028037159430956
Twenty years have passed since the Northern Ireland question was first raised in this Parliament.	0.9218630418487712
May I ask: Quousque tandem - Noiz arte?	0.9688778274540689
Thank you, Mrs Dührkop Dührkop, I should like to assure you of my empathy and sincere respect.	1.2359896722681984
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	0.4510321946745718
The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed.	0.7162302620677699
Are there any comments?	0.1337831580886173
We are about to discuss the subject of reforming the Commission and you will recall, Madam President, that at the beginning of the last session, I raised with you the question of whether, in the interests of openness and transparency, the Members' register of interests could be made more available to the public by being published on the Internet.	1.475435382377172
You promised Parliament you would raise this subject with the Quaestors that very evening.	0.9328099499613088
I wonder if you are now in a position to confirm to Parliament that the Quaestors have agreed in principle that the register should be published on the Internet and, if so, whether you will personally set them a deadline - perhaps 1 April - for doing so.	1.4236786746404433
I can tell you, Mr Davies, that the Bureau has adopted the principle of publishing the Members' register of financial interests on the Internet and the Quaestors are studying in great detail the problems and the legal questions that it may involve.	1.3884536715964788
But we shall have a decision very soon.	1.0544988860176807
(The Minutes were adopted)	0.781558256585443
Reforming the Commission	-0.0
The next item is the Commission statement on Reforming the European Commission.	0.9412483165321941
I shall give the floor straight away to the President, Mr Romano Prodi.	1.4771685279036386
- (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, last July, here in your presence, I made a solemn commitment to reform the Commission.	1.2218729659635208
I would just like to take a moment to recall the events of last July: the outgoing Commission had been in crisis, I had just been nominated and you gave your preliminary approval of that nomination.	1.258418408462308
The climax of the chain of events was my undertaking to reform the Commission, to reform it thoroughly, completely revolutionising the Commission' s way of working.	1.2128374673455828
Today, that commitment has been fully discharged: you have the reform here, before you, in the form of an institutional White Paper which has just been adopted by the Commission.	1.4407849408882507
I would like to emphasise that, on that occasion too, the Commission voted unanimously, with one voice.	1.7093528725669034
Briefly, these are the main points of the reform.	1.470439809979637
One: definition of political priorities and translation of these into practical measures through the focused use of resources.	0.8281278675283252
This is at the heart of the system, and it is this, the setting of political priorities and the focused use of resources, which will enable the political sphere to assert its primacy and to take its responsibilities fully on board.	1.3833862309813563
In order to do this, we have created a completely new policy-planning mechanism, a system which will allow the College to set annual policy guidelines and to establish the budgetary procedure on the basis of these, to assign well-defined objectives to the Directorates-General and to keep the relationship between available resources and activities assigned under control, which is of fundamental importance.	1.4249337609660422
In this context, activity-based management is the key to ensuring coherence between objectives, actions and resources.	1.0425209903574228
The second point is human resources.	0.8548515203206859
It is the central part of our reform. Our staff are the Commission' s best asset, its richest resource.	1.4363302086192247
They are extremely highly qualified, of a calibre which it is difficult, if not impossible, to find in the individual national administrations because of the nature of the recruitment methods and criteria used.	1.3864507634180108
This was the impression I received when I first became President of the Commission, and it has been confirmed by observation during my daily work.	1.1509717850671741
However, at the same time, I have found that morale amongst the Commission' s staff is very low.	1.373643914410826
Previously, there was pride and pleasure taken in being part of a universally admired institution, but now staff are frequently demoralised by the unceasing criticism.	1.2099545066174424
All this has to change, and this is one of the main reasons for our reform.	1.2591703547291153
Recruitment, career development, mobility and disciplinary measures are all being based on completely new criteria: there will be greater emphasis on individual service, credible and, above all, verifiable performance appraisal systems, lifelong learning and a greater degree of management responsibility.	1.0251603690712645
These are the areas in which changes will be made.	1.0109099265998391
The third point, which was also rather a sensitive, key issue in the recent crisis, is financial management.	1.4718240854564946
This is the hub of the administration which has to ensure efficiency and security.	1.2636776152709457
We are going to create a management and control system in every Directorate-General.	1.086775224243229
At the moment, our control system is completely centralised; with the reform we will switch to a control system which combines decentralisation of management control with an efficient central audit system.	1.2092431726506236
This means that we will have a central financial service to provide financial management guidance and advice, decentralisation in every Directorate-General of the entire chain, that is of programmes, undertakings, contracts, expenditure and the related ex ante control systems, and an external auditing service which will direct these operations.	1.3490006656057634
This is a complete revolution of the Commission' s way of working; it is a totally different method of organisation and it will require a totally different way of thinking.	1.4080404882941842
We are familiar with the problems associated with this transitional stage, and it is this transition which has caused the greatest concern among our staff: we will therefore adopt the necessary security measures and put the necessary safeguards in place.	1.2931022730757296
In fact, the Commission desires this reform in order to become a model of excellence for the whole of Europe and the world.	1.455843551889259
We also want to be exemplary in our advanced use of information technology.	1.020774209392826
We want to be a model of a completely computerised administration.	1.4136319842162208
The Commission has been accused of being buried under piles of paper, and so we are going to become a paperless Commission.	1.3018525979396083
This will make the Commission itself more efficient and encourage the use of new technologies outside the Commission.	1.2611986583277883
This is not just a technical revolution, but a complete organisational revolution as well.	1.3831030636603943
I shall leave to Neil Kinnock the task of explaining the details of the reform, but I would first like to thank him for the intelligence, enthusiasm and energy he has brought to this exercise.	1.121858227205579
We would both like to thank all those who have worked on the project and all the Commission staff, who took part in the broadest debate ever organised at the Commission.	1.359430390350882
I would stress that this style of debate is something very new and, in my opinion, it has forced us to radically change our way of thinking as well.	1.2229391762157389
The White Paper before us is also the product of contributions from the Commission staff: they knew that the Commission would have to undergo substantial reform in order to become, once again, that internationally-admired institution which was at the heart of European history.	1.3790916381638743
The adoption of the White Paper marks the end of a chapter of history - and I hope that it will remain closed forever.	1.3317476580074106
Now we can focus on the future, on the challenges awaiting the Union and on the programme for 2000-2005, the contents of which we have outlined to you over the past few weeks.	1.4805308078895594
The very political essence of the reform is mirrored in the objectives of this five-year plan.	1.0499606371139434
We need - the whole Union needs - a strong Commission, a Commission which has regained its ability to act as a political entity and is recognisable as such in all its actions.	1.5462863441896537
This is why we are redefining all our work priorities.	1.0577368212226779
This is why we are offloading all the activities which it is no longer appropriate for us to carry out - another important area of reform - in accordance with a principle of decentralisation and subsidiarity.	1.2933550481813074
For this reason, we are reforming the administrative machinery in order to create the necessary conditions for us to be able to carry out our work efficiently.	1.1956576816783349
We will make the best use of the resources at the Commission' s disposal, but they are very limited and we have almost exhausted them.	1.4985835806344716
We may need to come back to you and ask for additional resources to fund the new tasks which have been assigned to us and those which will be assigned to us in the future.	1.1673046647178738
In September, we undertook to present a White Paper on reform, and today we are fulfilling that undertaking according to the conditions established in your presence.	1.3531405955859512
The Commission wishes to be judged on results and results alone - on what we achieve.	1.2337665028637994
I would, however, remind you, and this is my final point, that the Commission is not the only Community institution.	1.6548688991410216
Parliament and the Council are also called upon to take up all the challenges presented by these reforms.	1.2846697658290258
The Commission has resolutely forged a path, and I hope that all the institutions will follow it right to the very end, in the service of the citizens of Europe, to achieve an ever-stronger and ever more transparent Europe.	1.4827025257789643
I am glad to be here together with President Prodi and my colleague, Michele Schreyer, to present the White Paper adopted by the Commission this morning: "Reforming the Commission" .	1.3338321902410373
As honourable Members will see from the document, which will be available to them today, the unprecedented consultations with the staff of the Commission, with this Parliament and with the Council, which have taken place since the adoption of the consultation document in January, have been very productive and resulted in useful refinements.	1.4278093983148568
Together with Romano Prodi, I express my gratitude to this House and to the very large number of people who have put time and effort into giving us their constructive responses.	1.4304490456199843
The White Paper puts reform in its proper political context.	0.8313386675160895
