The Erika cost no human lives but it may have ruined many human livelihoods. Just as the Sea Empress, just as the Braer did.	1.1135566606718896
It is absolutely certain that all three left us with an ecological disaster.	1.0865292686517631
My group's sympathy goes out to the people of Brittany who have seen their area despoiled by this disaster, just as my group's sympathy went out to the people of West Wales and to the Shetland Islands on previous occasions.	1.1201064860952055
Is it not about time that we stopped expressing sympathy and started issuing enforcement notices to get rid of these ships of shame in favour of safe seas or we will be back again, later on this year, discussing a new motion for a resolution when yet another flag-of-convenience tanker sadly goes down spewing its crude oil all over the sea.	1.1000831865858949
The time for resolutions has passed.	0.8696327274544328
What is now needed is action.	0.7669885383255425
Sadly, I fear, the Council will yet again fail to act and we will be back in the future discussing yet another maritime and ecological disaster.	1.6275840375970705
Mr President, every time there is a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again.	1.5032687975183674
In reality we can never stop accidents happening at sea, but it is incumbent upon us all to learn the lessons whenever an incident of this kind takes place and apply those lessons to reduce risks in future.	1.096525222267645
The "Erika" incident was serious especially for the people of Brittany most closely affected, but it was devastating for the wildlife of much of Europe.	1.1864471552695628
Some say that it is the worst accident that has ever befallen the bird life of this part of Europe.	1.1847152898967765
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds believes that as many as 400,000 birds, perhaps mainly guillemots, may have died.	1.1059425860595693
The pictures many of us will have seen of oil-soaked birds being put down by veterinary officials were both distressing and tragic.	1.010390556205179
We all want the highest standards for ships whatever flag they may be flying.	1.0541322663143344
We need to enforce the regulations and ensure that the "polluter pays" principle is applied so that financial penalties and some incentives are used to put pressure on both ship operators and oil companies to ensure that best practice is introduced.	1.0746004796567923
I agree with every word the Commissioner said in her remarks, but the question is, how long will it take to ensure that measures are introduced to deal with the problem in the way she proposes?	1.486848590836487
As a politician she needs to remind her officials how difficult it would be were she to have to come back to this Parliament in a year, were a similar incident, just as devastating, to take place, if some of the measures she has proposed today were simply still remaining as fine words and she had not had the chance to put them into practice.	1.3781831999368273
The thought of an incident of this kind occurring in the near future should concentrate her mind and the minds of her officials wonderfully.	1.0624595227304738
Mr President, Commissioner, I have brought you a small gift. Here is a cake of oil sent by someone living on the French island of Noirmoutier who wrote to me as follows: "With every tide, the beach is covered with heavy fuel oil which has leaked out of the Erika.	1.1905308276407787
With every tide, the volunteers, members of the armed forces and firemen remove great pancakes of this thick, sticky, black tar.	0.903636198254334
When will we see a return to cleanliness and the end of this devastating accident?"	1.1254752995928095
Indeed this disaster involving the Erika, like that of the Russian vessel in Turkey, moreover, is unacceptable and intolerable at a time when the ultimate hi-tech technology is available.	1.2357491108268814
It is all the more unacceptable for such a thing to occur twenty years after the Amoco Cadiz disaster, despite our saying at the time and many times since, "Never again!"	1.2481062413165367
It is, of course, the responsibility of policies, and therefore our responsibility, to guarantee the safety of sea transport.	1.311900599624876
We absolutely have to guarantee our citizens that a disaster of this type will never happen again.	1.1178513043270124
But, listening to you, Commissioner, we are somewhat frustrated because anyone already involved in these matters knows that in 1992, I believe, the Commission and Parliament drew up a very interesting text which already contained all the proposals included in the resolution drawn up by the transport committee.	1.362071078346691
Indeed, we must say and keep saying that the Erika is one disaster too many.	1.3363357281705914
This is why it is essential, as a matter of urgency, for the European Union to undertake a radical review of its directives on sea transport to make them more restrictive and to establish clear and specific regulations determining the responsibilities of the owners of the cargoes.	1.2891139873514605
We should be aware, for example, that Shell and British Petroleum refused to use the Erika to transport their oil.	1.2062971431027958
Why, in these circumstances, is the liability of Total as charterer not recognised?	1.3443767501882795
Your proposals must also include making double hulls mandatory and enforcing observance, at last, of the ban on degassing at sea.	1.1680777833965037
A European inspection body must be established which can monitor the condition of vessels effectively and efficiently.	0.9408826528936299
In addition, it is also essential for the European Union to undertake to reform the IMO, as a matter of urgency.	1.4675628924928006
What point is there in issuing restrictive directives if, once they are at sea, most vessels do just what they wish?	1.2072715889215604
Finally, a compassionate thought for all the volunteers, nature lovers and bird lovers, who spontaneously and generously are coming through to the aid of the oil-covered birds, organising rescue operation with the means available.	1.1974812877894745
I can testify to this remarkable work.	0.584657069626099
You are no doubt aware that approximately 200 000 birds are going to die as a result of this oil slick, which is a major ecological disaster, practically unprecedented in scale.	1.2494602487121573
In relation to this, you are no doubt also aware how difficult it is nowadays to preserve natural species as well as natural spaces.	1.1419305673886384
And, on this subject, Commissioner, you did not mention how the Commission intends to contribute to the restoration of the natural environment and the natural habitats.	1.2968300752009965
Once again, there will be no clearly defined party responsible.	0.9895754501568828
In the meantime, it is nature that is taking the rap, as always.	1.4556197334373346
Mr President, my group asked that this debate be set up in order to provide Parliament with an opportunity to express its solidarity with the people directly affected by this ecological disaster, affected both in terms of their economic activities and in terms of their attachment to their natural environment.	1.2587609384857945
Let me, in this connection, welcome the presence in the visitors' gallery of Mrs Javette-Le Besque, spokesperson for the oil slick action group "Marée noire" , made up of men and women from the French department of Morbihan.	1.1732571865701007
Many volunteers from France and other European countries have expressed their solidarity by lending a hand to the victims in the field.	1.2718146128630858
As the European Parliament, we can express our solidarity primarily by taking action in order to ensure the immediate release of emergency aid to the families affected by the oil slick and, at the same time, demanding tightening up of the quality criteria, on the European and international scale, of the regulations and standards governing the safety of sea transport, stipulating much more frequent inspection and sanctions that are a far greater deterrent to offenders.	1.36391607073706
Our proposals are particularly concerned with the age of oil tankers.	0.9583260347561908
Among those inspected and found to be in contravention of regulations last year, 15 were at least 20 years old and some were 30 and more.	1.096818452788245
This is no longer tolerable.	0.47655926074014965
Next, we have flags of convenience.	1.3481498936847933
According to the International Transport Federation, over 40% of the ships wrecked in 1998 were sailing under flags of convenience, the symbol of profit and the exploitation of human beings at the expense of safety.	1.252163242585965
This is no longer tolerable.	0.47655926074014965
Finally, there is the lack of transparency.	1.3959981361256044
Everything is done to make the lines of responsibility, the identity of the owners and real decision-makers as impenetrable as possible.	1.1937010707015345
This is no longer tolerable.	0.47655926074014965
In all these respects we must ensure real, significant change, including setting a time limit for the switch to new standards, including the mandatory double hull, on pain of being banned from the ports or the territorial waters of Member States.	1.30853313761205
We must also ensure increased strictness both in issuing sea-worthiness certificates and in monitoring the condition and the maintenance of vessels.	0.9327935775040532
Finally we must ensure that all the parties responsible for disasters contribute to repairing the damage caused.	1.1097742782277389
I am thinking specifically of Total-Fina in the present instance.	1.2312684773833313
This is an approach, Mr President, which the European Union can develop with regard to the International Maritime Organisation.	1.778288904912827
In so doing, it will have proved its usefulness to public opinion which, in this instance, is awaiting clear, tangible action.	1.4061160446215055
Mr President, Commissioner, as a Member for the French Atlantic coast, for Vendée, I should first like to express the disgust of the people who are the victims of the Erika oil slick in the face of these disasters, caused not by a natural disaster such as the hurricane which has also just struck us, but by a crime.	1.4187554307802666
In this emergency, in this ordeal, we have seen a magnificent display of solidarity: local solidarity, national solidarity, and intergovernmental solidarity.	1.4970210616006339
What the stricken populations are waiting for now, those who have lost everything, particularly among those who made their living from the sea and from tourism, those people whose businesses have been compromised for several years to come, is not for the polluters to repair the damage they have caused, but for the gears to now be set in motion to ensure that their present misfortune serves to prevent similar crimes affecting other people in future.	1.2394856190296228
Quite clearly, we are now paying the price for our lack of concern.	1.195742490907521
Because our states, with the blessing of the Community, did not deem it useful to have its own commercial fleet and allowed meticulous shipbuilding know-how to disappear, we no longer have access to the clear traceability of vessels and we can see veritable coffin ships navigating our waters under flags of convenience, drifting according to the short-term interests of the multinationals.	1.2293223803352475
It is absolutely essential to put an end to this floodtide of irresponsibility, irresponsible charterers, untraceable shipowners and lenient certification companies.	0.854234048241599
So today we find ourselves in a state of utter confusion.	1.034372751376204
Obviously, such matters should be handled at world level, but the current international regulations of the IMO are far from adequate and are far too loose, and neither our own countries nor the Community have tried determinedly to make them stricter, despite previous disasters.	1.4208041366134678
Admittedly, there is the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund, IOPCF, but it waters down the issue of liability and sets its ceiling at a quite inadequate level, which must be reviewed.	1.3498196349202216
The question of flags of convenience must be reviewed within the IMO.	1.0003432500389862
It is up to the Members States and the Community to take the necessary initiatives to achieve this.	1.3978469414938146
Let me remind you that the Erika was sailing under a flag of convenience, that of a state applying for membership of the European Union.	1.1306955237569372
In addition, there are Community directives, but they are seldom applied, if at all, due to the insufficient number of national inspectors.	1.330371173992522
This omission must be remedied as a matter of urgency.	0.7479146223718636
A directive on maritime safety has been in preparation for many years, but it is making very slow progress.	1.1995675938646733
The Commission is displaying intolerable inertia and unacceptable shortcomings.	1.0481639129721736
The date when the Commission is supposed to present its communication devoted to this key issue is put off time and again. It is now scheduled for July.	1.4394487512768732
This must be brought forward.	1.024199875291949
The terms of the regulations to be enforced must be particularly clear and strict.	1.1467815761274047
I shall mention three issues that our group feels are priorities.	0.8250099043907636
Firstly, the liability of owners of oil cargoes must be clearly established and the victims of pollution incidents must be able to claim on this liability unequivocally.	1.143484983379817
The best form of prevention we can offer for the future is the sure knowledge we can offer charterers that they will be heavily penalised in civil, criminal and financial terms if they are not extremely vigilant regarding the matter of the safety of the vessels they select.	1.2442182588189725
Secondly, the requirement of the double hull as a condition for access to Community waters must be enforced as soon as possible and cease to be put off indefinitely.	1.1549482674592633
Thirdly, a strict age limit on vessels to be given access to Community waters must be established in the near future.	1.273085291308563
This could be of a maximum of 15 years of age.	0.8673773366870453
If we do not obtain a framework of Community regulations which is sufficiently clear, strict and trenchant, then those Member States that wish to do so must be allowed to take the necessary steps to protect their people and their territory, in the same way that the United States succeeded in learning the lessons of the Exxon Valdez disaster by making double hulls compulsory and banning all vessels more than 20 years old from their waters.	1.2376953615222888
Thus, the Erika was refused access to American waters.	1.2261098163392987
If the European Community had done the same, a great disaster would have been avoided.	1.4647175708942926
Let us ensure, Mr President, Commissioner, that this time we really do learn the lesson, even after the media hype and the shock of this House have died down.	1.2994546712379342
Mr President, Torrey Canyon, Olympic Bravery, Haven, Amoco Cadiz, Gino, Tanio, so many names we remember with horror.	1.1273942778848132
And now the Erika.	0.5392294455103697
Whose turn is next?	0.4413824622606393
Twenty one years after Amoco Cadiz, this umpteenth oil slick, the seventh since 1967, shows the irresponsibility of our successive rulers.	1.2130093507853545
The Atlantic West Coast once again is paying a high price for their inability to react, for their capitulation to the multinationals.	1.0406722121054892
It is hard to understand why the French and the Europeans allow something which the Americans refuse to accept, and why Europe, normally so quick to pass environmental legislation, has chosen to overlook the matter of maritime safety.	1.2734946085636476
And this is the result.	1.638526723968214
The Erika, a vessel flying a Maltese flag, a floating rust bucket, classed amongst the most dangerous type of oil tankers, has contaminated more than 400 km of our coastline, a case of pollution even worse than that caused by the Amoco Cadiz.	1.1781633479368272
As an elected representative for the Loire-Atlantique region, unfortunately, I can testify to this.	1.1461885709726223
There is nothing natural about these recurring disasters, they are the result of fate.	1.1208659625935726
They are the result of human thoughtlessness.	0.9075016255961581
What we have here is an ecological disaster.	1.2239799575248
Only the people cut off from the harsh reality of the grass roots could have any doubt about that.	0.9141850032731101
It is also an economic disaster for all the people who make their living from the sea and from tourism, fishermen, oyster farmers, shellfish farmers, people who make a living from the salt marshes, shopkeepers, etc.	1.078153182647572
The Erika disaster must be the last in the series.	1.1570466626787583
First of all, we must shed some light on this shipwreck.	1.191907192635514
Why do we not appoint a parliamentary committee of inquiry or get Members of Parliament involved in the team of experts which has just been announced by the Commission?	1.155093128087537
Next, as a matter of urgency, we muss pass legislation, firstly, regarding identification of the exact characteristics of goods transported.	1.3444091192589236
In fact, according to the experts, the oil the Erika was carrying was supposed to sink to the bottom and should never have reached the coast.	1.1399784383059666
We know what actually happened.	0.8134215048568733
Next, reliable technical inspection must be established like the technical inspection compulsory in France for vehicles more than five years old.	1.0385410334732148
We must regulate the use of flags of convenience, make double hulls mandatory for the transport of polluting or dangerous materials, work on technological innovations in order to be able to process or recover hydrocarbons at sea.	1.0400631718676874
This would be a minimum requirement, I believe, on the dawn of the third millennium.	1.4491456614035356
Non-compliant vessels must be denied access to European waters, the responsibility of polluters, shipowners or charterers must be determined in line with the principle of the "polluter pays" , maritime supervision must be strengthened to prevent any degassing, thorough and reliable inspection of tankers must be required, an appropriate "natural disasters" budget line must be re-established for Member States and, in the meantime, Community aid released on an exceptional basis and the French departments affected by the disaster should be made eligible for Structural Funds.	1.1947424636545994
I have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the EDD Group.	1.3379470728009264
Mr President, in the course of the last few years there has been a succession of serious tanker disasters world-wide and the countermeasures taken have either been ineffective or not worth mentioning.	1.1701711989725816
It is particularly bad this time, not least because it has affected a major European State; an incident which could happen again at any time.	1.3299968096144867
We urgently require a directive if we are to reduce these risks. The 15 clearly do not suffice.	1.1922936784040825
These guarantee - making no claim to be exhaustive - a minimum of 3 things.	1.26871500894668
No tanker or freighter fit only for the scrap heap must ever put into any harbour within the European Union again. All those involved, including the transport agent, are responsible for any ensuing damage, and these individuals are to provide satisfactory assurances.	1.2948667846441078
This is the only way of affording the victims the opportunity to make their claims for compensation.	1.2428337405774637
However, we must aim higher in the long-term, let there be no mistake about that.	1.4372908388302696
In other words, we need real cost-effectiveness for our entire energy supply system.	1.2017410252000544
Mr President, may I start by saying that I would like to thank Commissioner Palacio very much for her clear, adequate and, at the same time, very firm response.	1.3632844026541022
Many thanks for this.	0.5103239095963555
This also means that, in any case, I have a great deal of respect for the briefing note which she sent on 10 January but also for the action points which she announced today.	1.1893830654462927
The Erika disaster shows that when sound traffic and transport regulations are lacking at international and European level, nature and the environment come off second-best.	1.1010687642078403
The damage suffered, also in ecological terms, cannot be expressed in money.	1.0750122200925443
Hence also this joint debate involving transport and environmental management Members.	0.8870689373573794
During the Christmas break, when the Dutch media received attention for the Erika disaster, I had a look, just out of interest, on the Internet to see what arrangements were, in fact, already in place for the purpose of taking relevant measures, especially after Premier Jospin had said that Europe should do more.	1.4220691741840399
What I learned is that, actually, there is sufficient legislation in place but the problem is the lack of supervision.	1.25968598065844
Could I highlight a few points which have also been touched upon by the Commissioner?	1.028209322075812
First of all, the port-state control, according to which 25% of all ships require inspection.	1.1603562168374206
I think that this 25% should not only be enforced but that it should also be ensured that more inspections take place. So this 25% should be increased.	1.4263977833018824
Furthermore, if a ship is no longer seaworthy, not only should the facts be examined, but a legal system should be introduced which states or recommends that the vessel should no longer be used.	1.521604425267783
But this is not in place.	1.2958867993445389
Mr President, I would welcome some action in this area.	1.3548011733188985
Finally, as far as the technical requirements for ships are concerned, some Members have already mentioned just now that, since 1999 in the United States, ships should in any case be double-hulled.	1.5310230234091797
In my opinion, we should look further into this point, and I also think that the Marpol Treaty, which comes into effect in 2001, should be looked at very closely.	1.456934140412621
Mr President, I would like to take a brief, critical look at the accession negotiations with Malta and would like to express my gratitude to, and admiration for, the many NGOs that have at least rolled up their sleeves in order to save animals.	1.3132980596549801
Mr President, we have already had this discussion so many times in the past.	1.3843920454083851
We have achieved nothing so far, and we have been unable to reach agreement within the European Union.	1.300252325391168
That is why I will only believe that there is any point to having this debate today if what we are all saying today, and what the Commissioner has announced here, actually leads to legislation being produced; in other words, if you all go and say to your Heads of Government and Ministers: "you must push this through in the Council of Ministers" .	1.4462575882255801
Allow me to say first that what we are talking about is an environmental catastrophe, which also impacts on the economy and threatens livelihoods.	1.305789924660483
So what are we to do now?	0.6732554083516371
I have no intention of talking about past events; rather I want to look to the future.	1.3163466205449244
What are we to do now?	0.5714061054132
I will tell you a few things we should do.	1.1677426851250627
Of course, we need double-hulled vessels.	1.40473583953513
That goes without saying, but it is something that will only work through in the medium and long term.	1.267114551389715
So what do we need to happen immediately?	1.2745190648672315
We need technical testing of ships, that is obligatory technical testing every two years, and no ship to be operated without the accompanying certificate.	1.248596071128188
We need this at European level and internationally; we need something like a TÜV, an organisation that undertakes technical testing of motor vehicles in Germany, which is compulsory every two years.	1.3335707760452393
If you do not have a certificate then you are not allowed to operate the vehicle.	1.1585563136953894
This is what we need for ships.	1.1464174207494864
Thirdly, we need to carry out checks on these safety and insurance certificates in the ports, that is in every port of the European Union.	1.3744564726822355
Any failure to produce these certificates must lead to the ship being laid up and prohibited from leaving the port, regardless of all the port charges.	1.076960275531495
We must reach agreement here, in all the European Union' s ports, from Marseilles, through to Rotterdam, to Wilhelmshaven, Cuxhaven, and wherever ships drop anchor.	1.5500965484659772
Fourthly, we need the shipowner to bear liability, and not just to the tune of a derisory USD 12 million, but to the value of at least USD 400 million, to be covered per insurance certificate.	1.4872281656843516
We also need the country whose flag the ship flies to bear liability.	1.0137773997659514
We need to be sure that if need be, the country whose flag the ship is flying will accept liability.	1.1112397758782158
This would be a marvellous exercise in supervision!	1.0154846274485776
I can assure you that those countries awarding flags would then take great care to avoid having to accept liability.	0.9365442370705305
In the fifth place, we need there to be a guarantee that these demands will apply to all ships using the ports and waterways of the European Union, and incidentally, that includes the candidate countries.	1.4461357371955765
Last but not least, we need a long memory, for the issue of legislation will crop up on the agenda more frequently in the near future.	1.3801349807433014
Environmental standards will be a recurring theme.	1.0367574918052707
I would not like to have someone coming and saying that these requirements will lead to job losses in the ports.	1.1238966743311456
The unions will have something to say as will industry.	0.9592947987888469
A long memory will serve us well, ladies and gentlemen.	1.0812676982564147
I am looking at all those of you who have not exactly been at the forefront of the environmental movement.	1.1303316487937913
Just you go home and say: " we have not concerned ourselves with standards to date" .	1.2583094744396748
We need to have a long memory when it comes to the demands being made in the ports.	1.2114833312121758
We need to have a long memory when we say: " for once we are united, at last as far as port charges and requirements are concerned, and will not play one off against the other in the European Union."	1.4969057097711118
If we succeed in this then perhaps we will be better off in a few years' time!	1.1265075887531575
Mr President, Mrs Roth-Behrendt expressed very many of my own thoughts.	1.31029449102573
We have now obtained a first-rate enumeration of a variety of measures.	0.9881089360509793
But how do we make use of the sense of crisis to which this ecological disaster has led?	1.1688266929169784
I would compare the situation with an earlier generation' s introduction of the Plimsoll line, a marking which was introduced to prevent insurance fraud involving inferior vessels.	1.1359996086675015
Where is the sense of crisis which generations before us had?	0.790448757685635
I consider that what we should adopt is the form of certification that Mrs Roth-Behrendt speaks about, the identification in the form of green marks on tankers which certain harbours in Europe have brought up for discussion.	1.1517195527330675
We must also critically examine the classification societies.	0.9434280099945238
I do not think that we can accept their procedures.	1.4002588126616382
We need independent procedures and procedures involving public control.	0.6970746612516507
Finally, I want to say that, when my country provides environmental aid to shipowners who wish to improve the quality of the environment, there are units within the Commission who regard this as prohibited aid to shipyards.	1.2840781670091728
Within the Commission, the one hand does not know what the other hand is doing.	1.8846237205790561
It is not an acceptable procedure that measures to improve the environment, which are in keeping with the Commission' s guidelines, cannot be taken because these are considered to constitute prohibited aid to shipyards.	1.4429679886284603
Mr President, we shall vote in favour of the GUE/NGL Group resolution because it denounces Total-Fina' s responsibility in this ecological disaster and I endorse the proposal that flags of convenience and the use of superannuated vessels should be prohibited, or that double hulls should be mandatory for oil tankers.	1.2039453444554153
I shall only add that it would be the least that Total could do to compensate for the direct and indirect damage caused by the oil slick.	1.1448719901553486
How can we stop similar disasters occurring in future if we do not institute draconian measures against the major oil corporations, and indeed many others who, in order to make more profit, take the risk of making the world uninhabitable?	1.2920586174590547
How is it possible not to be outraged when a bank refuses to divulge the names of the Erika' s owners on the grounds of professional confidentiality, without governments reacting?	1.1624346003289725
The crux of the problem is that all governments, and indeed all the European institutions, acknowledge the right of major corporations such as Total-Fina and its ilk to maximise profits whether it be harmful to their employees or to the environment.	1.2722706720888866
They accept the professional confidentiality of business and banks, even though this same confidentiality serves to conceal what are essentially criminal actions.	1.0376653563230365
In these circumstances, even the best resolutions will remain little more than appeals to principle which are powerless to limit the great corporations' capacity to cause damage.	1.0414408443512848
Mr President, I am in favour of tightening up the legislation on port state control and on classification societies.	1.0193378830017619
However, we must stick to the facts.	1.437051585454527
The ship Erika has been investigated four times in the course of the last two years.	1.0458161674034863
The answer cannot lie in the number of investigations but rather in guaranteeing the rigour with which the controls are undertaken.	0.88145912946216
I have heard in the course of the discussions that have taken place in the last few weeks that the Member States do not have enough money to undertake the controls.	1.4521613430273193
I cannot accept this.	0.7074574797182868
If the Member States decide, in agreement with ourselves, that 25% of ships are to be monitored on the basis of port state control, then they must also make the necessary personnel available.	1.5187184501402768
The controls must also be carried out in such a way that the inspector does not just go on board and check whether there are any fire extinguishers missing, rather there must be materials testing, for this ship obviously broke up on account of material fatigue.	1.277204156689519
This can only be detected if controls undertaken are more rigorous.	0.7767139995860893
It should be our goal to ensure that port state controls are not superficial, but include materials testing.	1.2753219019964546
Secondly, I also share the Commissioner' s observations and would like to encourage her to continue down this path.	1.4404065140284208
If it should become apparent that one or more classification companies have provided reports by way of favours then they should be struck off the list of authorised classification companies.	1.0165752924795093
That is the only deterrent we have for preventing other classification companies from following suit.	1.1347732552302654
Mrs Roth-Behrendt, we already have a TÜV (organisation for safety testing) for ships in the form of the classification companies.	1.2581211333699394
There are reputable companies too.	0.5042939076072783
You will be familiar with some reputable companies, our French fellow MEPs will be familiar with some reputable companies, but we must look carefully at exactly which companies do not fulfil requirements, and these must be struck off the list.	1.117451274425472
Finally, we should make it quite plain to Malta that if it wants to become a Member of this Community then by the time it accedes it must apply a standard in respect of registration and flag state control which completely fulfils our requirements, for the environment is a communal entity and not something that we can divide up!	1.4178399660055634
Mr President, Commissioner, the Erika sank near my home and is still there, with 20 000 tonnes in its hold, the fate of which we are waiting to discover.	1.377425249658853
It could have sunk anywhere.	0.6916381144954777
It happened to sink there, and Brittany, where I come from, should not apologise for the fact that geography has made it a peninsula, and the result is that it is often forced to clear up after shipwrecks.	1.3412125451365198
My first thoughts are for the 26 Indian sailors, who were saved but of whom nothing has been said.	1.1307718277471237
There could have been deaths in this disaster and safety at sea means, above all, men' s lives.	1.037721996522871
By now they are far away.	0.8087387333209511
It is a miracle that they were saved.	1.3811334685338617
So we are now experiencing the same thing that happened 20 years ago with the Amoco Cadiz; a wreck on the North coast, a wreck on the South coast, a wreck on the West coast.	1.241569276649193
Things could well continue in the same way.	0.7583320005968416
Commissioner, as time is very short, I would like to pick out the seven points which we feel, and you have already mentioned some of them, are essential to work on: double-hulled vessels in our waters as soon as possible and the strictest possible state control of ports. In particular, we must ensure that classification societies are compelled to make their reports public, as currently, we do not have access to them.	1.5158755640679584
Then, sanctions must be harmonised between the 15 Member States; they should not be different, but the same throughout the Union.	1.2770728767879906
We must be tougher on vessels flying flags of convenience, not because they are necessarily bad boats, but because amongst these boats there are many bad ones.	1.4025926510773297
We must improve information on all of the world' s ships, but provision has already been made for this. We must also target those responsible and take a tougher line with them.	1.5194193889664482
With regard to this matter, I would like to know who owns the Erika, because the idea of a legal person under our law is one thing, but there are always real shareholders in the background. Where are the Erika' s owners?	1.3786140801340996
Perhaps they are in lovely villas by lovely beaches, getting a nice tan.	0.8480637649135121
We would like to know their names and their faces.	1.1555007557468813
Finally, there must be improvements in the training of crews.	1.3647841699952394
In our society there is no such thing as zero-risk, but we must at least ensure the greatest possible levels of safety.	1.3737187832947453
Mr President, I welcome the statement from the Commissioner.	1.1368140241018994
Having spent a lot of time at sea myself I am well aware of the sea's power and destructive force, which make a proper design and maintenance of ships and boats essential.	1.1398486103944512
I would like to express my sympathy with all those who are dealing with the consequences of the breaking up and sinking of the oil tanker Erika.	1.0578260215283277
This has been an environmental disaster as well as a deplorable waste of resources.	1.1945472166447526
It should be noted that the oil industry, through the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds, regards itself as liable under the 1969 Convention and its 1992 Protocol, for over 90% of the estimated cost of this incident, or some USD 170 million.	1.2105206009918392
This suggests to me that we should also look to the shipowners, to the flag state and the inspection authorities to shoulder their share of the responsibility.	1.2965762857599765
However, before we rush in with a whole raft of new measures and new regulations, let us look carefully at the existing arrangements to be sure that they are being properly implemented.	1.313328308444727
Better to heed calls to amend and improve existing legislation than to embark on new proposals.	0.8057904276771954
In that context I support calls to strengthen port state control to ensure full and effective inspection.	0.9901484219284183
I support calls to ensure that the classification societies effectively monitor vessels' structural conditions and are held accountable for their actions.	0.9691687991019698
Calls for design improvements in hull construction, especially double-hulled vessels, are sensible but take time to be implemented throughout the fleet.	1.2623570286824015
They are no substitute for rigorous regular inspection.	0.7435241235392641
Mr President, I would like to thank my Socialist colleagues, mainly in the committees on transport and the environment, who have not forgotten that this disaster also affects the fishing industry.	1.381498266713723
Because, as well as the irreparable damage to the environment, the damage to the ecosystem and losses in the tourist industry, the oil slick dealt a huge blow to the fishing industry, to the conservation of marine resources, and the damaged coast lines will take years to recover.	1.324562665689504
It is no accident, Commissioner, that the affected areas are always those European regions which are least developed, those which eke out a meagre existence from tourism and fishing and which, in the majority of cases, do not have any other resources.	1.3123379838115294
These are the same areas, Commissioner, which already have to put up with the disrespectful activities of certain shipowners who empty the bilges of their vessels off their coasts, without any control whatsoever.	1.343095986193228
I come from a region, Galicia, which has suffered similar accidents in the past.	1.271084784204291
Brittany and Galicia, two European 'Lands Ends' , fall constant prey to the irresponsibility of those who prefer not to comply with safety regulations and transport crude oil in vessels which in themselves constitute potential oil slicks.	1.0145293988547395
I therefore believe that it is necessary to act in two ways.	1.0236176502234253
On the one hand, by asking the Commission, within the scope of aid to the fishing industry, to implement special measures to compensate for the effects of this catastrophe on the industry in the areas affected, and also by asking them to demand, of international bodies and of themselves, tight controls on ships which sail under flags of convenience.	1.3236170079249303
In this regard, the current process of negotiations on Malta' s accession to the European Union must be used to ensure that this country rigorously monitors the oil tankers which sail under its flag.	1.2952890342208299
On the other hand, prevention is essential.	0.780148183352467
Portugal is a country which has clearly demonstrated its sensitivity to issues relating to the sea.	1.0504756135889506
I would ask the Portuguese Presidency to study the possibility of implementing a complete strategy for the prevention of maritime accidents at European level, using all the means at our disposal - technological, structural and socio-economic - to prevent a disaster such as this from happening again in the future.	1.2801524980305796
Lastly, Mr President, I would like to highlight the work carried out by the volunteers and local authorities, who reminded me of old times when, as the then Mayoress, I lived through similar situations.	1.2890758812458616
We must thank those who, while defenceless and lacking in resources, have battled courageously against the grave effects that this disaster has had on coastal regions, the marine ecosystem and European fishing stocks.	1.2330207729863125
Mr President, as chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I should like to congratulate the Commission, and in particular Commissioner Loyola de Palacio, for her reaction to this incident, which has really shaken the whole of Europe.	1.3116891494410956
We, as the Committee on Transport, are prepared to discuss the Commission communication on the question of safety at sea and, of course, we are likewise prepared to discuss, at a later date, the legal implications of this communication.	1.4802735105635856
In addition, I should like to make a number of comments:	1.092519914277733
First, the Commission was right to concentrate its investigation on the liability of RINA, the Italian shipping register, because we need to know if Community law was applied.	1.5300633227371898
That should be the starting point for our efforts.	1.061229741836208
Secondly, apart from the shipowners' liability, it would be a good idea in such cases to examine the liability of the charterers, for example the oil companies which are also responsible for causing ecological disasters like this and, of course, for restoring the damage.	1.4137704700707192
Once we have done that, our reaction to the ecological disaster is fully justified.	1.4209454256530611
However, this should not lead us to accuse the whole merchant marine, which is an important sector of the economy, covering as it does 1/3 of transport requirements, which is why our reaction needs to be measured: strict, but correct.	1.4243403561044878
I have no objection to examining an amendment making Community law stricter but, as other members have stressed, we need to start with application, because there is already a legal framework at European Union level and we must not lose sight of that fact.	1.4115296515232865
This legal framework is fairly advanced, at least if you compare it with what is happening at worldwide level and the Member States, under the supervision of the Commission, should endeavour to ensure that Community law is actually applied.	1.3434853105790323
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that the unfortunate incident involving the Erika should in fact, as others have said this afternoon, constitute a decisive watershed which will see the end to this type of accident in the European Union where, since 1967, there have been seventeen accidents involving large oil tankers; more than one every two years.	1.2899475649138172
The economic and social damage, which we have spoken about today, in terms of the loss of jobs and fishing and tourist resources, is so great that they fully justify decisive and thorough action on the part of the Community institutions.	1.2688398454822982
Commissioner, I would also like to thank you for the speedy response of your department to this event and the measures which are being adopted and implemented.	1.26740100191126
I trust that these measures will, in a few months, give rise to a clear and convincing legal instrument - a directive, possibly - which will put an end, once and for all, to these 21st Century pirates, who deprive us all of the wealth and beauty of the sea.	1.494988846463944
I would like to comment on one of the measures to be taken, which was mentioned by the Commissioner and some of my colleagues.	1.6478740090732882
I am referring to the double hull, which consists of two layers of steel, with containers divided into two tanks.	1.1449784743003881
Commissioner, there are many experts who consider that the double hull is not sufficiently safe and propose the so-called 'ecological hull' in which case, in the event of an accident, the seawater penetrates the containers and, as a result of pressure, the oil is transferred to other tanks.	1.4701835680472557
Commissioner, I believe that it is time to opt for the safest technically possible measures.	1.1844472022363528
It is therefore not sufficient to merely reproduce the legislation in force in other countries.	1.2270185207144633
I believe that we can and must improve the existing legislation in this regard.	1.390597996581938
Any cost-benefit analysis which truly takes into account all the harm occasioned to persons and the environment by these accidents, is bound to support this approach.	1.208640379499663
Mr President, Commissioner, I think that first we should all congratulate ourselves on the procedure that has been adopted and which will lead us, after each of our respective political groups has rallied together and expressed its feelings, finally to produce a joint resolution.	1.3992756866824538
I think that given the dramatic circumstances, and as a matter of principle, it would be ill-advised and inappropriate to hold several votes.	1.3570362919102257
On the other hand, Parliament is issuing a resolution in one vote, for which we can see the agreement amongst the various speakers who have preceded me. I think that this is an opportunity to put parliamentary pressure on the doubts or evasions of a few governments and I think that we are providing the Commission with a powerful political act for the preparation of a European maritime area.	1.4069869753231943
I think that it is quite obvious, and this is the first conclusion that can be drawn from the Erika disaster, that public opinion would find it hard to understand that we regulate chocolate but do not regulate maritime transport.	1.2290777507755142
Public opinion would find it hard to understand that we talk about a common judicial area, common airspace, a common rail area and a single market, but not a common maritime area. I therefore believe that this is a project which must be opened up with the absolute will to see it followed through and followed through in concrete terms.	1.3857201984538767
The Commissioner has suggested three main chapters which need to be drafted and brought into line with our legislation, in which we can set standards.	1.3266208305428437
I have also noted, to my great satisfaction, that even the groups advocating greater national sovereignty, or the eurosceptic groups are calling for Europe to regulate, and I think that this is in fact the right level to take action.	1.548025184328214
We sometimes regulate things which could, by and large, remain subsidiary.	1.0301416965244445
In this area we must respond to public opinion.	1.1147630758351625
This is extremely important and everyone should feel concerned because we are, when all is said and done, on the global scale merely a peninsula.	1.1331555592600042
Therefore, once our legislation has been brought into line, we must follow this up immediately with appropriate law. We must also put in place systematic controls and finally apply the 'polluter pays' principle of responsibility which is, of course, supposed to be a deterrent.	1.4118833958305486
I have almost finished and I would like to say that I have personally requested a public hearing of the Committee on Transport, which would enable us to provide an immediate follow-up to the Erika case and to suggest possible future considerations.	1.2215927167040497
I hope that all political groups will support us in our request for a public hearing.	1.2663858344377779
Mr President, the oil tanker Erika, the ownership of which is veiled by accommodation addresses on Malta and probably in Italy and Greece and which was hired by Total-Fina for the transport of oil, foundered off the Breton coastline, with disastrous consequences.	1.2700894960229654
The implications for the environment and for the flora and fauna of the European maritime environment are enormous.	1.1723226604786836
The cause of the disaster must be sought in the weakened structure of the oil tanker.	0.9872014830355648
So people are doubtful about the safety of ships which carry dangerous or polluting goods.	0.8269741753994251
The International Maritime Organisation has issued international rules in this connection.	0.8700744850940092
States can carry out port inspections.	0.5562717456574593
In Europe, legislation is stricter and it is compulsory to inspect 25% of the incoming vessels according to the port-state control directive.	1.1551247628785157
However, it seems that none of the Member States meets this figure due to a lack of inspectors.	1.2908655518047039
It is clear that there is no lack of legislation.	1.0669951278833805
In my opinion, the Commissioner is quite right.	1.320282960275547
Where the scheme falters is in the enforcement of existing legislation.	0.8814863273447977
But how are we now going to enforce this if there is indeed a lack of inspectors, esteemed European Commission?	1.0234006288040305
Can the Commission provide an assurance that Directive 93/75 concerning minimum requirements for vessels bound for or leaving Community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods will be implemented correctly in all Member States?	0.9456265193190891
Should its implementation not be more strictly monitored?	0.8969236091200473
Would it not be beneficial, in the short term, following the Rotterdam model, to inspect according to a points system in which, for example, account is taken of the ship' s age, whether it is single or double-hulled or whether it sails under a flag of convenience.	1.1444897309412476
In short, to give priority to older sub-standard ships over ships which meet all quality requirements.	1.0667543514242162
The Erika was built at a Japanese shipyard and is single-hulled.	0.8851907573420136
There are four more sister ships in service at present.	0.8094816675245627
Construction of this type of ship was halted at the time because the risk of rusting was especially high.	1.0524368145573688
Some of them also sail under the Maltese flag.	0.8866200539372304
Are we waiting for the next accident to happen?	1.0397093941127218
Would sanctions not be appropriate, as the Commissioner stated, for the classification society?	1.4195463109385733
RINA is currently the talk of the town.	0.8254332174324903
Malta is entering the accession negotiations.	0.5956941123515698
In my opinion, the European Union can only accept Malta if it is guaranteed that the Maltese flag will sail without an accident in future.	1.1654770609338334
I would be grateful if you could be disciplined since we are running out of time, and this delay is going to limit the time available for Questions to the Commission.	1.2551629479799682
Mr President, just before I went down into the Chamber, I received an e-mail with a quite emotional description from a Swedish woman who had chosen to spend New Year' s Eve on the French coast in Brittany instead of staying at home and celebrating with her relatives.	1.2434278481684997
Like many other hundreds of volunteers, she had seen the destruction, washed birds and cleaned up after the people responsible who were not to be found on the coast on those evenings and nights when they really should have been required to be there.	1.1423353966943401
Like so many others, I too wonder where the people responsible are.	1.3663805604999137
Where are the shipowners and those who order the shipments when these disasters occur?	0.8816019787761183
Perhaps it might be time for us to begin to consider establishing a common environmental authority which could deal with this type of crime.	0.9886003893102047
This is not the first time we have seen oil slicks, whether intentional or unintentional.	1.3360683485443159
(The President cut the speaker off)	0.0993768251480497
I would like to thank Mrs Grossetête and her colleagues for bringing this motion before Parliament.	1.113323001172727
The environmental disaster of the sinking of the Erika off Brittany and the spillage of 10 000 tonnes of oil has been widely reported in the British media.	1.0458998604432594
Although Britain and France have had their differences recently, I can assure you that there is considerable sympathy in my country for all those affected.	1.2591081538868192
TV pictures of the damage done to your coastline and wildlife, in particular birds and the already dwindling fish stocks, have brought back memories of similar British disasters, such as the Torrey Canyon in 1967, and have prompted many British volunteers to help.	1.2096810618090665
I salute these joint efforts to repair the damage.	0.7220182950142828
This is clearly a problem for all EU coastlines which will require imaginative solutions.	1.1470193570956815
Instead of allowing the costs of these disasters to fall on the communities most affected and insurance markets such as Lloyds of London, we must develop new technologies to retrieve from the sea much more than 10% of the lost oil.	1.2906179733503143
There is currently little financial incentive for this when the insurance market picks up the tab.	0.9344842527785396
Ultimately, the polluter must pay.	1.1133318275342465
In addition we must build on the Council directive dealing with enforcement of international standards for ship safety and pollution prevention by ensuring that the inspection goal of 25% of ships calling at EU ports is met and that a high standard of inspection is delivered.	1.0914931518620938
Moreover, although I am not opposed to shipowners registering their vessels in their country of choice, I believe there is a need for stricter application of international regulations.	1.3009177925945927
Rather than banning flags of convenience, which would violate the right of every sovereign state to have a merchant fleet, under the 1995 EU directive on port state control, national maritime authorities must impose more effective sanctions on flag states which fail to carry out their international treaty obligations.	1.1936935467379368
I sincerely hope that, particularly during the French presidency later this year, the Commission and the Council will look carefully at all these options, and I heartily commend this resolution to Parliament.	1.4215037789771576
Mr President, it feels quite strange to be standing here again today, as I have been doing at regular intervals for almost ten years, and all because of an accident caused by human hand and by a lack of human competence, and not by force majeure.	1.451513975412673
The victims are waiting outside.	0.5875592535922277
They want answers.	0.34560834274245494
They do not want any more promises that we then fail to keep, or to see any efforts that we then fail to follow through.	1.2449412079646003
The citizens are right to ask: "do our regions now count amongst those which are lost forever?"	1.065661497373539
Who will provide us with new jobs?	0.6994241349694672
When will those responsible at last understand that sparing resources is not something we do for fun; nor is it just a question of creating a system for its own sake or a new study group, rather it is a joint European challenge.	1.288329301629371
That is why I welcome Mrs Palacio' s action plan with open arms.	1.290372881739799
It is equally important to note that "prevention is better than cure" .	0.8975869079000027
But there is an art to that as well.	1.0928872197674089
Deploying the German multipurpose ship "Neuwerk" - it is right outside my front door in Cuxhaven - entailed the swift provision of European neighbourly help.	1.1513793944683028
We are particularly in the debt of those who undertook the difficult deployment of all their crew.	1.0346007423635228
Valuable experiences were gained, and also the knowledge that we cannot master such environmental disasters using state-of-the-art technology alone.	1.2435464685611743
We are therefore right to demand improved controls, sanctions and preventive measures.	1.0237763064553032
I have been fighting for a European environmental coastguard service for almost ten years, here in Parliament.	1.2263615232546412
The issue is as topical as it was before.	1.1390254805234252
Furthermore, I will not withhold my support but will endeavour, alongside my fellow MEPs, to bring about improvements and logical solutions within the framework of European and international cooperation.	1.4607805142808372
Mr President, firstly I would like to express my very sincere thanks, not only for the initiatives of the different groups, of Mrs Grossetête and the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, but also for the initiatives of Mr Wurtz and the Confederal Group of the United Left/Nordic Green Left, who proposed this debate, which has led to a positive and important discussion.	1.3571437617207585
Before the end of March, I propose to present a communication in which I will possibly present legislative texts, that is to say, amendments of specific directives so that discussions may begin in the Council and in Parliament.	1.4050263659284754
I would like to tell you that, in fact, it is not just an environmental problem - it is a very important environmental problem - but it is also a very important social problem.	1.4527386362449741
There are men and women who depend on fishing, gathering shellfish and the service or tourist industries in these coastal areas. They are environmentally sensitive areas, but they are also sensitive from the point of view of social development and territorial equilibrium.	1.23380305188189
And therefore we must take the utmost care to prevent the recurrence of a similar situation.	1.145857410752403
Mrs Roth-Behrendt said that nothing had ever been done.	0.8157295820345857
In fact, I believe that things have been done by the Commission, but there is still more to do.	1.5858937471159928
This was demonstrated by the Americans who, after the Exxon Valdez disaster, within one year, adopted enormously rigorous and tough legislation, which threatens, as I said earlier, to divert ships unacceptable to American ports towards Europe.	1.365023105847364
In Europe, after the Amoco Cadiz, or the Urquiola on the Spanish coast, in 1976, or the Torrey Canyon, in the same year, or the many other cases there have been, we really began to legislate after 1994 and 1995, particularly in the last few years.	1.5382761622000012
During these years, the emphasis has mainly been on the safety of passenger transport.	1.1116797495731263
That is the reality.	1.0571587115240397
In my opinion, we now have to make a significant and urgent effort to confront new problems, also deriving from American legislation, which emphasise the safety of the transport of dangerous goods in the maritime sector.	1.3012435407374736
I have referred to a series of issues which I will lay out in more detail, if you wish, in an appearance before a special committee on this matter, or when I present the actual initiatives in the coming months.	1.3057307863759227
My intention is - and I insist - for us to begin discussions after the end of March, also coinciding with the Council of Ministers, and, of course, before the end of the six-month period of the Portuguese Presidency, for us to have texts to discuss.	1.4375505327285603
Flags of convenience are one problem, but are not the only one.	1.497609925230326
The Romanian flag is not a flag of convenience but, nevertheless, that country has an extremely high number of incidences at inspections; more than the countries with flags of convenience.	1.3531644154729314
Malta and Cyprus have asked to join the Community.	0.8128650178088392
We must be demanding on this issue and we are negotiating to this end.	1.6439196746610782
This will oblige us to reconsider the registers in the European Union, and to deal with the notorious problem, which will no doubt arise again, of the aim of a Community register.	1.4747628490603741
I believe that this will be difficult but, in any event, we should carry out a review of the registers of the European Union countries.	1.5711099592044648
As for the inspections, very much a key question, the first thing we have to consider is how the current legislation has worked, as Mr Hatzidakis has said.	1.65920573126188
We already have legislation.	0.6444707194640201
According to the information which the Commission services have given me, this legislation is not adequately applied in many Member States due to a lack of personnel, means and inspectors.	1.2458084814599253
The problem is not that only 25% are inspected, but rather how we select, how we find, the ships which constitute the highest risk, through the age of the ships and the risk history of the flags.	1.3791733608513723
Unfortunately, the 25% often consists of flags which are expected to fulfil the requirements: in this way inspections are quicker and the work is carried out more easily.	1.2772941076889939
Therefore, more than making amendments, we will have to implement measures to control what is already being done, apart from some supplementary requirements with regard to reviews, especially in relation to the age of the different vessels.	1.44402036431283
And that is why we have SOLAS (the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea) and MARPOL (the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships), two conventions of the International Maritime Organisation which will eventually have to be made mandatory in all Member States of the Union and whose application will have to be monitored.	1.307441136465155
With regard to the question of Union inspectors, I believe that the principle of subsidiarity justifies the idea that these inspections be carried out by the Member States, which does not mean that the Commission does not have to ensure that the States carry out their duty adequately.	1.3813463114739655
Lastly, I would like to stress the issue of liability. Not only in terms of maximum sums insured, which I believe should be similar to those in the United States.	1.2629907494474995
We have set a figure of USD 180 million; in the United States they are talking about USD 1 billion as a maximum ceiling for covering claims payments.	1.2252822062514233
I believe we have to increase the current amount so as to move closer to levels in the United States, but that we also have to reconsider the sums insured on vessels and, therefore, the liability of shipowners, and also to hold liable those who charter ships, which is to say the owners of the cargo.	1.3860951140524684
Unless we require that the owners of the cargo be held liable, we will never, in my opinion, resolve these problems.	1.1833085308242066
I will end now.	0.7558686246808025
I will not expand further. We will have the opportunity to do so on other occasions.	1.3042709766741072
But, obviously, as some speakers have said - and I thank all of you for your totally positive and relevant interventions - we cannot allow a situation where, within one, two or three years, we have to say once again that we have not done what we should have done.	1.721158203840559
As for me, I can say, after having debated it in the College of Commissioners, that the Commission is prepared to present the necessary legislative measures, amendments and directives to Parliament and the Council, in order to equip ourselves with the greatest possible level of safety.	1.4041823439613332
The political will of this Parliament is required - and I can see that I can count on this - as well as that of the Council of Ministers.	1.572602861736186
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	0.47513528222732565
We have taken good note of your intentions.	1.1632610152627645
I have received 8 motions for resolution, in accordance with Rule 37(2), to close the present Commission statement.	1.189740729651204
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.	0.29695966651602207
Storms in Europe	-0.0
The next item is the Commission statement on the storms in Europe.	0.924597101950867
Mr Barnier has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	0.7413990388362205
Commissioner, I would like to thank you for the ideas you have put forward, particularly on the very specific proposals concerning the people affected and who are expecting a lot from the European Union, in terms of the help that we can offer them.	1.3789331911590321
In the days immediately following this terrible storm I wrote to you myself with a request for you to ask the French authorities to redraw the boundaries of Objective 2 so that all areas devastated by the storms in France and elsewhere could benefit from Objective 2.	1.133713146591418
I think that you must have done so, because you have not mentioned it.	1.606178931850411
In fact, we all know that anyone who does not live within the perimeter of an Objective 2 region will find it all but impossible to obtain aid.	1.2671790124766062
We should therefore put this situation right immediately.	0.9740470207191179
You also know that this will not only be a short-term problem, but also a medium and long-term one.	1.5718843801562303
Let me explain.	0.4927154615522146
I was in the region of Lorraine at the time of this terrible storm which destroyed around 20% of deciduous forest.	1.291492766430309
Indeed, for some 'forestry' districts, which have lost 20% of their trees, this represents a huge loss.	1.540039006107942
We know, for example, that it takes between 150 and 200 years for a tree to reach maturity, so the loss these towns will suffer will not be spread over one, two or five years, but over many more.	1.3092227005873172
The towns concerned estimate that it will be spread over 40 years.	0.8937380879161627
I think that consequently it will be extremely difficult indeed to compensate these rural towns through subsidies for losses in their financial revenues.	1.1293864821732975
I think that this is something which we should continually bear in mind so that we do not lose sight of it in our various policies.	1.3841601842830014
It is true that the problem of the forestry sector is an extremely complex one.	1.274624950906719
Indeed, you spoke of releasing funds for timber storage on the grounds that its price must not depreciate.	1.2547522041205472
On the other hand, districts which have not been affected by the storms will also suffer, as the National Forestry Office has decided to freeze cuts in forestation for four years.	1.1417311220745456
Those districts which have not suffered losses will therefore see their incomes decrease in any case.	1.0210367876203383
I am telling you all of this to illustrate how complex the problem is, and I thank the Commission once again for extending their analysis of this situation as far as it could.	1.4819347489893977
I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that, although there has indeed been an economic disaster, the real ecological catastrophes are still to come.	1.301773595676872
As you yourself said, Commissioner, these disasters or storms do not always have natural causes, and we think that these are the first signs of climate change.	1.455724472333566
We should therefore review our policies in order to take account of this fact.	1.2318508314632666
Mr President, everyone who has travelled here by car, train or aeroplane, has been able to see the extent of the damage, particularly in France, caused by hurricanes of a completely unprecedented violence which struck Europe at the end of last month.	1.3571498838823304
What can the Members of the European Parliament do when faced with such a widespread disaster?	1.2681318790804608
Firstly, I would like to pay tribute to the mayors and local representatives who, on a daily basis, have had to reassure their constituents, organise volunteers and cooperate with the public services.	1.3692268220062689
They have earned the confidence of their fellow-citizens.	0.815953976888649
Next, I would like to thank the emergency services and the armed forces of the Union' s Member States who, in a fine example of intergovernmental cooperation, came to support the efforts of their French colleagues.	1.3708749106926321
I would also like to consider the paradoxical situation we have with regard to emergency aid.	1.0722917390258655
If this disaster had taken place in Guatemala or Turkey, we could have immediately used the Community budget to help the victims, but in our own countries nothing of the kind is possible because there is no suitable budget line with which to do so.	1.4517668853972185
We must also ask the Commission not to prevent local authorities and individual States from coming to the assistance of businesses affected by the disaster by applying Community competition rules too strictly.	1.2201141621607305
I am thinking in particular here of fish and shellfish companies, which have been particularly badly hit.	1.063295061485738
As you said, Commissioner, we must ensure that there is compensation for the forced cessation in activity and that appeals can be made to FIFG for investments that have been totally wiped out.	1.0673644136812777
Beyond this, I think that implementing MAGPs in a mechanical way will no longer be appropriate in the coastal regions that have been affected.	1.245324737656205
I therefore ask the Commission to stop doing so and, on the contrary, to help those who make their living from the sea to proceed to new investments, which they urgently need.	1.4034220641998734
Mr President, the storms which devastated France during the night between 26 and 27 December have caused, as has been said, 90 deaths and damage to a value of FF 75 billion, i.e. EUR 11 billion.	1.2135241458671053
Almost three weeks after the disaster, several thousand people were still without electricity and telephones, 500 000 hectares of forestry land, or 100 million cubic metres of forest, have been ruined, and our historical heritage has also been affected, as the sad example of the park at the Palace of Versailles demonstrates.	1.2412701187009187
It seems quite natural that given such a disaster, national and European solidarity should go to the help of the devastated regions and those people who have been worst affected.	1.117652733642374
As the previous speakers have said, and as you said, Commissioner, in response to my fellow Member, Mr Martinez, with regard to another tragedy, the floods in November in the Southwest of France, you have certainly noted these disasters with concern, but all you are doing is pointing out that the budget line for emergency appropriations for natural disasters has been discontinued, which has resulted in this shocking paradox. This paradox, pointed out by the previous speaker, is that it is easier, a great deal easier, to offer help to victims of natural disasters outside the Union than within it.	1.4348066347370916
We know full well that what you are doing, Commissioner, and that is, limiting yourself to giving us the hypothetical and remote possibility of benefiting from the Structural Funds of the new Objective 2 or from the provisional Objectives 2 or 5b.	1.2196163926146881
These are the terms of the written answer you gave Mr Martinez on 11 January 2000.	1.016979759927245
I can show you a copy if you wish.	0.9427028553761501
We would understand completely if you were not able to say anything else given the irresponsible attitude not only of the Commission, but also of this Parliament, and if you cannot do anything because there is no legal or financial framework for doing so.	1.4038641959370406
But for pity' s sake, and I am not saying this to you in an aggressive way, please do not present appropriations which have previously been earmarked under an unrelated regional policy as aid for victims of the storms.	1.2533214233631595
As a matter of urgency, therefore, we must restore, within the framework of a supplementary budget, the budget line which was allocated to us for natural disasters.	1.4286044335305703
We must use the Berlin Summit aid appropriations and we must change the forestry policy implemented in most countries in the Union. That, however, is another problem altogether.	1.4505123199267869
Mr President, Commissioner, Europe has undergone a tough ordeal at the start of this millennium.	1.0897259826590742
I would first like to express my heartfelt condolences to the families in mourning as a result of the appalling weather conditions that devastated Europe in December.	1.0239887332666697
These storms were an unprecedented ecological disaster for our forests.	0.7756085875977731
I hope you do not mind if I make particular mention of the forests in my region, Lorraine, which have suffered enormous destruction.	1.2236601724944365
I would like to congratulate the regional authorities, the volunteers and the public services on the fantastic way in which they rallied round but, unfortunately, their troubles are not yet over.	1.4414881799591637
It is Europe's duty to support them and thereby complement the efforts of the governments of Member States affected by the disaster.	1.1560479964661254
I welcome Mr Barnier' s statement and I also welcome the measures which the Commission has announced.	1.4054953237299188
I am certainly not forgetting the economic dimension of this matter, as the timber industry has been devastated and a whole population is suffering the tragic effects of this.	1.2062131666845293
The Community action programme for civil protection, established by a Council decision on 9 December, was launched on 1 January 2000.	1.3385468683879695
I ask Member States to grasp this opportunity. This programme must work at full capacity.	1.2756639388951858
Although it may have been effective in certain areas - and I do not doubt the sincerity of Commissioner Barnier' s words - unfortunately it is still in its infancy when it comes to forestry.	1.3877023447546062
Our priority, as we wait for Community-level funds to be freed up, is for material aid in terms of partnership exchanges between Member States.	1.2636328198977393
It is therefore a matter of urgency to improve forest roads, and to repair them as quickly as possible.	1.3351250993610142
Lending forestry equipment and making personnel qualified in forestry management available are also covered by this measure.	0.8410215746187404
Our next challenge will be to prevent the occurrence of phytosanitary problems which could result from having to abandon large amounts of wood in the forest, and from the pollution of ground water through having to store such large quantities of wood.	1.0835167295986197
Finally, it is essential that we slow down the logging of standing wood, in order to give priority to the purchase of windfalls.	1.2958649454416926
These timber sales should be supported by strong media coverage in Member States.	0.7916670921083411
This aid for gathering timber is, of course, only the first stage of an aid package, which will take the form of aid for reforestation and aid for the development of rural areas.	1.2488835728623517
I ask the Commission to incorporate this into a study of how the situation should be managed now that the emergency is over.	1.2398438421030102
This is a very sad opportunity for Europe to renew its forestry heritage in line with the role that this plays in wildlife and nature conservation and in our economies.	1.1714962650704857
It is therefore a time for solidarity and cooperation between Member States in the face of an ecological and economic calamity.	1.1627146896082727
If this solidarity is to have been worthwhile, it is up to Europe to propose priority actions for safeguarding the timber industry.	1.2777508370084592
Hurricane "Lothar" should prompt us not to abide solely by the principle of undertaking repairs once the damage is done - something which is discussed at a very superficial level here -, but to switch to the precautionary principle, under the terms of which potential perpetrators are brought to book too.	1.16727576242695
Current programmes must be accelerated.	0.5702432894588529
For example, as they stand, the Commission' s programmes will preclude us from meeting our obligations under Kyoto.	1.4200172866837937
The trade in emissions rights is immoral to my mind and rather than solving the problem, it shelves it.	1.1487777036367517
The entire taxation system must be given an environmental perspective in the medium term.	0.963216233677587
We must work more rapidly towards achieving the targets stipulated in the White Paper for renewable energy sources, as this would bring about a massive reduction in greenhouse gases.	1.1910954678427959
The new Commission has not put forward nearly enough on this subject, and what it has put forward is woefully inadequate!	1.454084111453364
Commissioner, Mr President, Lothar was a quite ordinary name hitherto.	1.2151901236462086
However, it has now achieved notoriety.	1.6737331926898897
The hurricane of the same name swept across Europe claiming numerous victims, mainly in France and Germany, but also in Switzerland, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.	1.2216748022803356
The wind triumphed over electricity pylons, roofs, traffic signs and, ultimately over the forest.	0.9849037050700845
We have heard that in a short space of time the storm left us with approximately 120 million cubic metres of solid timber, and this is only an estimate.	1.2035859157054882
I have listened to you very attentively Commissioner, and welcome with open arms the fact that you are intending to go and see for yourself the effects the catastrophe has had in France and in Germany.	1.3169920772836692
If Mrs Schreyer is to visit the Black Forest sometime in the next few days, then any one farmer might ask her how the Commission and Europe would be able to help him as an individual.	1.2409266089608684
What would you say to the forestry manager if his enterprise happened not to be in an Objective 2 region, or in a 5b region?	1.351816268209059
What answer will the Commission give, when it is on the scene, when you tell the forestry worker that we support road construction and dam-building, and we want to rebuild our cultural heritage and create tourist attractions etc.? All this is well-intentioned advice.	1.3196436552074748
However, I come from an area in Northern Germany where the forestry industry predominates and I can tell you that we are already feeling the effects of the immense damage.	1.3835703997893454
The thinning-out we need is not being attended to; the forests are not being tended to the requisite degree.	1.1169057732882866
What we need the Commission to do as a matter of urgency is to approve national aid, so as to avoid the competition issue being raised again at a later date.	1.2173757361631272
Mr President, Commissioner, permit me, first of all, to make reference to two facts.	1.14135053900964
Firstly, at the beginning of 1999, NATO, with the participation of most Member States of the European Union, flattened Kosovo with bombs in the name of freedom.	1.2810746317091535
We are now endeavouring, at huge cost, to get the country back on its feet again and help its people, and rightly so.	1.4069972234215782
Secondly, at the end of 1999 unbelievable storms raged bringing death and destruction to vast tracts of the EU.	1.198535066009431
The Commission in Brussels responded to the victims' cries for help with a shrugging of shoulders.	1.0193961669581162
"We do not have the wherewithal for that," they said.	1.2392870817292672
This is wrong!	0.3455865222931484
And no one can comprehend this attitude.	0.8457288775223206
Certainly those who fear for their livelihood are at a complete loss.	0.920152424791262
The citizens of the European Union expect solidarity, also from within this Community.	1.2596546697810571
I say they have a right to solidarity.	0.9835733699744402
Indeed the European Parliament must make it its business to uphold this right in hours of need.	1.286885172745843
I urge the Commission not to keep having to be asked and to provide assistance for the victims of the storms.	1.2710953999988683
It knows the ins and outs of aid provision better than any local organisation or authority.	0.7693147310348117
I call upon you, ladies and gentlemen, to support me in bringing home to the Commission the fact that what most Brussels offices are lacking is not so much the wherewithal for providing aid as the good will.	1.2423982275738767
Permit me one further comment. Although it was less evident in the case of the consequences of the storm, the tanker disaster off the French coast has made it very clear that we need to give the Commission a helping hand on another matter.	1.3205922813626758
The European Union needs rules governing environmental liability as a matter of urgency.	1.166822019479606
We can no longer tolerate a situation where the general public has to foot the bill for damage that has often been caused by individuals involved in criminal machinations.	1.006502103079856
We must make the perpetrators liable for all manner of damage done to our environment.	0.9301179250719794
Then, for example, people will think twice before transporting oil in a tanker that is about to fall apart.	1.141436733469357
When, in 1994, over five years ago that is, I joined the Legal Affairs Committee in this Parliament, I became rapporteur for the environmental liability dossier.	1.5940923709219272
To this day I am still awaiting an initiative from the Commission, which will actually enable me to start work.	1.34577945819374
It is a scandalous state of affairs that must be ended with all haste, and I hope that February does not see this dossier being postponed yet again!	1.2529774767292963
Mr President, Commissioner, the storms that took place at the turn of the millennium should galvanise us into thinking about certain problems.	0.948679286865408
It has become clear that mankind continues to be unable to avoid natural disasters.	0.8738735148348914
There have always been natural disasters and there always will be.	0.8347640474619457
Of course, there is a need for solidarity here.	1.10636289458329
There is certainly a need for European civil protection, and the EU budget must also provide for a budget line covering natural disasters.	1.4631186131263474
But, most importantly, it is only ever man that makes the mistakes as far as the nature-mankind relationship is concerned - despite the fact that the same mistakes have often been made down through the centuries - and never nature, for nature cannot make mistakes.	1.4302484933205415
The extent of the damage caused on this occasion was determined by the population density, the type of infrastructure, and, of course, the many monocultures, if we are talking forests.	1.401301288578607
Of course, I am in favour of providing assistance where we can.	1.241098343534381
But when it comes to aid, we ought to bear in mind that perhaps in future, more emphasis should be placed on laying electricity and telephone cabling underground.	1.3522725503574446
We must take account of smaller cycles and plant stable mixed woodland when undertaking reforestation, rather than monocultures.	1.016735747437342
The most important subject for discussion in this context is the climate.	1.15442926674366
To this day, we in Europe remain in the privileged position of having the Gulf Stream, and the Gulf Stream still does its stuff.	1.4414127084537636
America and south-east Asia are having a much worse time of it as far as climate and storms go.	1.1733439246856283
We are fortunate in having the Gulf Stream.	0.6683255552498452
But in common with others, we too are having to endure the greenhouse effect.	1.2288069127947936
This is partly the work of human hand, as difficult as it is to demonstrate climate change using calculations.	1.6036472650423967
We must take more account of the guidelines produced at the Kyoto environmental conference.	1.2863481313665228
We must reduce CO2 emissions, employ renewable energies, and generally make enquiries, in this connection, as to how the forests of Europe are faring.	1.4736782634881473
Mr President, I think we should firstly express our sorrow for the victims.	1.125804761698803
This is an irreparable loss.	1.1735949752385253
Secondly, we welcome the solidarity between the French departments and citizens, and the solidarity of other countries with France, which is the country worst affected.	1.5383870055248243
As I have little time, Mr President, I would like to touch upon two elements of our resolution.	1.2268657328005927
I believe that the first one was implicitly recognised by the Commissioner in his speech when he wondered whether these catastrophes are natural or not.	1.154076273340631
That is to say that experts are ever more convinced that climate change and human activities, in general terms, are linked to the increase seen in natural disasters in recent years.	1.2230339288984176
In fact, over the last decade, the temperature has risen more than in the rest of the century.	1.2325186522428406
Therefore Europe must be clearly committed to the Kyoto Protocol and make specific proposals.	1.0079396751771228
Secondly, I was rapporteur for civil protection in Europe and I completely agree with the Commissioner' s proposal to create a European civil protection body.	1.51957497581217
Furthermore, we should utilise an extraordinary budget line, since this is an extraordinarily catastrophic situation.	1.5529171912345248
First of all, we would like to express sympathy with all the families and communities that lost members in this terrible tragedy.	1.2821142354430193
It is really the loss of life that makes this particular disaster an extraordinary one by European standards.	1.0130749145132774
It is regrettable that we do not have any instrument with which to give assistance in situations like this.	1.1753759715828789
I want to thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive statement on the subject and his suggestion that we might indeed organise ourselves at European level to give assistance to Member States and regions that have tragedies like this.	1.291031363638258
That is important.	0.3906482444523105
The other thing we should remember is that we did have a budget line in the past.	1.304392204638419
It was very small.	0.5349382699828819
It was not able to do very much but it was repeatedly abused by Members of this House proposing action when the disasters were not even major.	1.2576758010616609
Officials and ministers from Member States were coming to Brussels, whispering with the Commission and getting a few euros and making a political point by bringing aid back to their constituencies.	1.2088526623539115
So there was not much sympathy for this budget line when it was abolished.	1.051609406280156
I think we should reinstate this budget line.	0.9404789212905685
When we had the earthquake in Greece, which was a big disaster, the Community had no instrument with which to offer its sympathy or solidarity to the Greeks.	1.3233344026870677
The same when the floods came in France and the same again now.	1.119134030130896
These are major disasters, we should have an instrument, we do not have it.	1.6118466584166449
We should reinstate that instrument and we should make the rules tight so that only in situations where grave disasters occur will we call up this particular instrument.	1.146045022910843
We can save it from year to year and ensure that when something major happens we have an instrument to deal with it.	1.0376002986251633
We did not have it so bad in Ireland this time although we have had many serious wind storms on the Atlantic.	1.151431433979367
We had floods in Ireland also and I want to express my sympathy with the people in Ireland who suffered from these.	1.1786689156407122
Ladies and gentlemen, none of us must forget what has taken place.	1.1496214897809793
It is true that there was a joint decision by the Council and Parliament seeking to discontinue emergency lines.	1.2860520196237268
It is also true that there is a lot of European money around. Commissioner Barnier has pointed out that oyster farming and agriculture would be eligible under Article 30 of the regulation concerning rural development, forestry would be eligible under Article 33, companies would be eligible under exemptions from the competition law stated in Article 87(2) of the Treaty and public facilities would be eligible under the Structural Funds.	1.1907469149092063
It is nevertheless the case that not a penny more than what was allocated before the storm will now be freed up to demonstrate practical, active solidarity.	1.1472773496900446
It is nothing more than the States playing at taking from Peter in order to give to Paul.	1.1800450043689683
This is inadequate, and I am personally delighted that Mr Barnier has stated an idea close to my heart and which, moreover, I expressed when I told the press in Bordeaux what I am hoping for, and that is the establishment of a reinforced policy of European civil security.	1.3464497790553325
If the European citizenship that we all want to see is to come into being, if the mandate that our President, Mrs Fontaine has staked on a closer relationship between the Union and Europe' s citizens is to be effective, our citizens must be able to feel that we are acting with some urgency.	1.5352028982049486
I therefore believe that a European civil protection force, real civil relief blue helmets, who would go to areas in difficulty within the Union, as we currently have no emergency procedure, but also outside the Union if needs be, in Venezuela or anywhere else, is something that we should hope to see. I would like to tell Commissioner Barnier that in me he has an active ally for this idea which strikes me as noble and truly European in spirit.	1.4406553761392829
Mr President, Commissioner, when we compare the frequency with which storms occur in other parts of the world with our own situation, we see that Europe gets off relatively lightly.	1.3169783039678993
Nevertheless, the storms that took place in the last week of December showed us what the consequences can be and that there are major problems in store for us.	1.2425488735020782
Anyone travelling to Strasbourg by car or by rail would have been able to see for themselves that storms raged in Alsace as well.	0.9995344750718465
I would therefore like to extend my sympathy to all those citizens in the regions where the storms raged so furiously, and at the same time, from my position here in this Chamber, point to how important it is to support these regions and people.	1.3734286407319825
Each and every one of us knows that any other region of Europe could meet with just such a fate tomorrow.	0.962805509641526
What we need to do now is to deal with the fallen timber as swiftly as possible.	1.0585419966952003
For it is common knowledge that we could have an even greater disaster on our hands if the fallen timber were to be left in the forests too long.	1.1936565367257213
For instance, it should be pointed out that fallen timber provides the best breeding ground for the bark beetle' s larvae, and we are not yet in a position to assess the repercussions this will have.	1.3362041012728196
That is why it is absolutely essential to deal with the fallen timber before the warmer weather arrives.	1.0117031818641797
Decades will have gone by before we are able to determine the true extent of the damage sustained by the forestry industry.	0.9031591150513351
For we all know how long it takes a tree to grow.	1.0066334911650516
The calculations are in decades rather than years.	0.6798519618924249
In addition, I would like to point out that the forestry industry is certainly not just about timber production, for barrier woodland and woodland that acts as a shield against avalanches also constitute an important factor in certain regions.	1.116893898662482
I am therefore very proud to say that the skilled Austrian forestry workers are also prepared.....	1.1084605316711276
(The President cut the speaker off)	0.0993768251480497
Mr President, I extend our deepest sympathy to all of those who were affected by the storms.	1.1698973843179092
Sometimes within the Community we do not actually have an awareness of what is happening in other countries.	1.2669036373374347
We had very little coverage in Ireland of the tanker that sank.	0.8179572795688329
I was asked to highlight the result of the storms in Ireland.	1.2959749690331408
We had high winds and unprecedented, prolonged rainfall which, adding to existing difficulties, resulted in thousands of acres being submerged, sometimes, in up to 15 feet of water.	1.0733000277027291
We experienced the human misery of flooded homes and farms, no sanitation, no drinking water and the environmental disasters of E.coli-infected water.	1.1796462120953792
I talked with farmers whose ewes were aborting their lambs due to drinking the infected water.	0.6989413819643746
Natural habitats were destroyed.	0.42207139079416633
So I ask that Ireland be remembered in this particular case.	0.9234864428607382
I thank the Commissioner and support him very much in his European protection force.	1.240559970773013
Mr President, Commissioner, I second all those who expressed their solidarity with the storm victims.	1.149645653931782
I would just like to point again to the impact on the forestry industry throughout Europe.	1.1510158499836636
For the storms will have major implications for the forestry industry in all areas of Europe, and I believe we need, in the long-term, to give thought to how problems of this kind are to be dealt with in future.	1.4164723476237737
We certainly do not want market organisation for forests, but maybe we should set up a system, perhaps in conjunction with the private insurance sector, which will make it possible to mitigate the implications for the victims in some way.	1.4387288903598108
Unfortunately, we can expect there to be repeat performances of this kind of major disaster in the future.	1.3822134141620044
As has already been mentioned here, there are indications - no proof, but clear indications - that the increase in storms world-wide has to do with the climate catastrophe.	1.3378932576255493
Of course, the scientists do not all see eye to eye on this yet, but the majority of them are fairly convinced that if we continue to emit greenhouse gases as we are doing, these storms will, of course, hit us much harder still at the dawn of this new century.	1.3512458779749297
I believe now is the right time for us to think back once again to a proposal put forward in this Chamber by a former fellow MEP of ours, Tom Spencer. He suggested that rather than giving storms the names of men or women, we should name them after the perpetrators of the greenhouse effect - he proposed the oil companies at the time.	1.3016459424979354
However, an exception should certainly be made in the case of Shell and BP, for they have changed policy and do not just base their sales on fossil fuels which are damaging to the climate, rather they also invest in forms of energy that have future viability.	1.288311700478028
We must be aware of this connection; I do not support those who make sweeping statements to the effect that the greenhouse effect is to blame for this storm, but one thing we can be relatively certain of is that we have reason to fear further catastrophes if we do not soon alter our course!	1.4043839840366954
I have received seven motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.	0.7362265685245909
That concludes the debate.	0.19308667519260808
The vote will be taken at noon on Thursday.	1.2416540720748839
Food safety	-0.0
The next item is the communication on food safety and a statement by the Commission.	1.3292488673411944
Mr President, I am very pleased to take this first available opportunity of outlining to Parliament the main lines of the Commission's White Paper on food safety, adopted on Wednesday last, 12 January, in association with my colleague, Mr Liikanen.	1.4658227251271017
At my hearing last September, I promised speedy delivery of this White Paper.	1.0450833455650301
I am happy that we have been able to deliver so quickly.	1.1232143201823712
The White Paper represents three to four months of intensive work since the new Commission was appointed last September.	0.9652928675242041
It takes on board the extensive consultations of the past couple of years since the Commission's Green Paper on food law was published.	1.2326278016873524
Equally it reflects our experiences of recent food alerts in such areas as dioxin and sludge, as well as the BSE crisis.	1.0325518817105561
The White Paper also reflects the concerns of this Parliament which you have outlined to both President Prodi and myself on the numerous occasions we have debated food safety in this House since the Commission was appointed.	1.3808742514076842
I do not need to remind you that consumer confidence in Europe's food safety regime has been badly affected by the crises and alerts of recent years and months.	1.1526164462128166
The Commission is fully committed to restoring that confidence by putting in place the most up-to-date and effective food safety regime in the world.	1.0489490923242646
When I launched the White Paper last week I said that the shopping trolley is one of the most potent weapons on the face of the earth.	1.1138216726653147
The most discerning decisions are made by the consumers of Europe.	0.8706961324363158
If their confidence is damaged this is reflected in shopping decisions. This in turn has a dramatic effect on farmers, producers and industry generally.	1.0362799178565612
In an industry worth some EUR 600 billion annually, even a slight dip in confidence levels can have significant effects.	1.0047613569578655
Between the agro-food sector and the farming sector there are over 10 million employees.	0.8885284002788347
High levels of confidence are necessary to boost job numbers and competitiveness.	0.7838621168790326
This crisis of confidence has also had the unfortunate but inevitable effect of eroding the trust of consumers in the systems and institutions at national and European level that should monitor and assure the highest standards of food safety.	0.9980240727238726
In saying all of this, I would like to make it clear that Europe nevertheless has one of the best food industries in the world and also one of the safest food control systems.	1.2693865134188196
The challenge is to make the system the very best.	1.1226071894400536
The overall objective therefore of the White Paper on food safety is to put in place the necessary legislation and structures that will guarantee the highest possible level of health protection for consumers arising from the consumption of food.	1.0263891989055398
We are setting out a challenging and ambitious agenda for change.	0.9507567741387617
The Commission will need the full support of Parliament if we are to achieve our ambitions on schedule.	1.393241567017443
We will also need the fullest support from the Council and other key stakeholders.	1.3799515296675802
The White Paper on food safety outlines a comprehensive range of actions needed to complement and modernise existing EU food legislation.	0.858431764308613
All of these measures are designed to make it more coherent, understandable and flexible.	1.1650431901373037
We want to promote better enforcement of that legislation and to provide greater transparency to consumers.	1.1576523630263265
The detailed action plan on food safety in the White Paper sets a precise timetable for action over the next three years.	1.020615445013697
Over 80 measures are envisaged.	0.5732803346275271
Our objective is to put in place a coherent and up-to-date body of food law by the end of 2002.	1.059652111979184
We are also envisaging the establishment of a European food authority by 2002 as an essential complement to the new food safety regime.	1.2035480504511868
This idea will be the focus of much scrutiny and debate.	0.9191355455368266
It has already attracted much comment, including reactions from Members of Parliament.	1.161072588982125
The chapter of the White Paper devoted to the establishment of a European food authority is clearly designed to elicit views and comments.	0.7965972958103625
We are seeking views by the end of April on what we envisage.	1.1712477854324437
I will return to this process of consultation in a few moments.	1.2890830244862574
The Commission believes that major structural change is required in our system of food safety to ensure the twin objectives of assuring the highest standard of food safety and restoring consumer confidence.	1.0835392114807032
Why should a European food authority be an essential part of that structure of change?	1.019156638400948
The first key concern is independence.	0.6092183020770552
Key stakeholders, including consumers, are seeking a system that is independent and perceived to be independent of all vested interests.	1.2684102651515887
We must also ensure excellence and transparency.	0.9517868732911885
We have made a lot of progress over the past couple of years since the reformed system of scientific advice was adopted as a consequence of the BSE crisis.	1.0757705679959741
However, the Commission believes that we must go further.	1.6039263634929863
We must create a permanent and truly independent, excellent and transparent system of risk assessment.	0.9497017127379448
The key task of the authority will be risk assessment in the area of food safety.	1.0585176785210002
We envisage that the work of the existing five Scientific Committees devoted to food safety will be transferred to the authority.	1.0015494560129012
They may not be transferred in their present form or structure - this is an issue on which we will elicit views before making our definitive proposals on the authority's establishment.	1.2359082109436976
However, if we were merely to propose a simple moving of deckchairs, this would clearly not be enough.	1.5686982736073287
As the White Paper makes clear, the new authority must be a value-added structure.	1.3104471038579135
I am of the view that the existing system of scientific advice needs to be strengthened.	1.144796111130991
Within the authority I envisage much stronger scientific and other support for the independent scientists.	0.9580852433103519
I am also envisaging that the authority will be much more proactive than our current regime - anticipate rather than react, identify issues before they become crises.	1.0554689307143572
This proactive approach should become the hallmark of the authority.	0.7646723184304057
To be proactive the White Paper identifies a number of new areas that would be embraced by the authority.	1.1030130509241922
These include a comprehensive information gathering and surveillance function, the coordination of scientific information in the EU, and building up strong networks with food safety agencies and bodies in Member States.	1.138111226269901
As part of its remit we also envisage the authority operating an enhanced rapid alert system for food and feed concerns.	0.9818051553062639
The Commission has decided that it is neither appropriate nor feasible to devolve risk management power to the authority.	1.1943890606217056
We believe that decisions in the risk management area should properly remain the preserve of the Commission, Parliament and Council.	1.2254146684240552
I make no apology for this approach; I firmly believe that it is the correct one.	1.176123409370951
Certainly there are those who would argue that we should give law-making powers to such an authority.	1.137740261225337
I do not accept those views and reject them with some degree of passion.	1.097349255246255
It was only last year that the Treaty was amended to give Parliament a much greater role in the legislative process.	1.3435103273658382
To give such a role to an authority at this stage would be, in my view, a retrograde step and represent a dilution of democratic accountability.	1.1914749323978235
I will be very interested to hear the views of Parliament itself in relation to this matter.	1.3238004881998704
There are also those who argue that the Commission could effectively ignore the advice of the new authority.	1.4578617694373972
I also reject this line of argument.	0.6597507257072187
How could a Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection reject or ignore well-founded independent scientific advice in relation to food safety?	0.9651110109419156
Would this be in the interests of Europe's citizens?	0.9369949295940654
In my view, most definitely not unless such rejection of the scientific arguments were soundly based, rationally argued and fully justified.	1.036208014379711
It seems difficult to envisage such a situation evolving.	0.7874401334520252
I can assure you here today that the Commission, in exercising its risk management functions, will fully take account of the scientific advice of the authority.	1.3908786244317841
I have already said that the authority will be charged with developing networks with national food safety agencies and bodies in the Member States.	0.9830198277588867
This is a major task.	1.3502799290087282
We must develop greater certainty in the science that underpins food safety in the European Union.	0.9719983802482076
The authority must become the authoritative source of scientific advice and information on food safety issues.	1.0025188295014502
This situation will not come about by the very creation of the authority but will evolve over time as confidence is gained in the authority itself.	1.1381017398038364
I do not believe we can be prescriptive in the area of science and advice based on science.	1.2264857611961728
However, with the evolution of dynamic networks with national scientific bodies and agencies, the authority will become pre-eminent on the European stage.	1.4666809897078283
I am also anxious to hear the views of Parliament in this regard.	1.2315471707737422
As an integral part of a value-added structure, the White Paper proposes that the authority would have a major role in risk communication: to disseminate complex scientific information in a consumer-friendly way; to be the obvious and indispensable port of call for the most up-to-the-minute data on risk; to be highly visible; to tell the good news story about food; to be proactive.	1.312301359606836
The White Paper also contains very important proposals in respect of controls.	0.958947757406356
This is a hugely important component of the system of checks and balances to ensure that Member States and operators are complying with Community legislation.	1.1172584912548376
I want to see a genuine internal market operating in the control arena.	1.2535334242295064
In this context we are also proposing to strengthen significantly the control function carried out by the food and veterinary office located in Dublin.	1.2098949445128255
This revised Community framework would have three core elements: operational criteria set up at Community level, Community control guidelines, and enhanced administrative cooperation in the development and operation of control.	1.1892357493563352
As part of our proposals in this area - which I expect to bring forward at the end of this year - I will be examining whether additional powers in addition to infringement procedures need to be given to the Commission.	1.5570451011228728
These could include withholding Community financial support or recouping funding already committed to a Member State.	0.768467495747064
These proposals must be seen as part of our mission to have the highest food safety standards in the world, boost consumer confidence and increase markets for farmers and producers in the Union.	1.163949666135218
In addition to the proposals for a new European food authority and an enhanced control system at Community-level, the White Paper proposes an action plan with a wide range of measures to improve and bring coherence to the Community's legislation, covering all aspects of food products from farm to table.	1.3685652723651054
It sets out over 80 separate actions that are envisaged over the period ahead and intends to close identified loopholes in current legislation.	0.9458120032881884
The new legal framework will cover animal feed, animal health and welfare, hygiene, contaminants and residues, novel food, additives, flavourings, packaging and irradiation.	0.9055350901075805
It will include a proposal on general food law which will embody the principles of food safety such as responsibility of feed manufacturers, farmers and food operators, traceability of feed, food and ingredients, proper risk analysis through, for instance, risk assessment - that is, scientific advice and information analysis - risk management - that is, regulation and control - risk communication, and application of the precautionary principle if and when appropriate.	1.2654358863752615
As regards the precautionary principle, I might add that the Commission is currently finalising a communication which I expect to be adopted very soon.	1.5170309998607368
I look forward to having a useful exchange of views this afternoon with the Members of Parliament who would clearly have preferred to do this last week if there had been an appropriate parliamentary forum available.	1.1961635934833823
However, having regard to my contacts with the presidents of the relevant committees, I recognise that this was not feasible.	1.5671263933367041
But I know too that we will have many further opportunities in the coming months to consider the White Paper's proposals on the authority.	1.3368963548170654
We now have a number of months to have the necessary debate on the Commission's ideas on the White Paper on the establishment of a European food authority.	1.2845600958516143
Parliament will have a key part to play in this debate.	1.1036880483850462
Parliament played a crucial role in Europe's response to the BSE crisis.	0.9690106595513618
It has especially active since then in bringing citizens' concerns about food safety issues to the fore.	0.962158988182518
I expect that Parliament's contribution to the debate on the authority can be as incisive and constructive.	1.05117006250882
While we have a number of months to the end of April to debate the issue and garner our views, I recognise fully that this is also a very tight timeframe.	1.4724167895823457
I would therefore ask Parliament to make appropriate arrangements to ensure that its views can be formulated as quickly as possible.	1.11100008872501
It is essential that the Commission should have the benefit of Parliament's contribution to the shaping of what would be a key component of raising consumer health protection to a new plane and thereby restoring consumer confidence in the European Union's food safety regime.	1.2917674665204826
The European food authority will be a key ingredient in the EU's food safety regime in the years ahead.	1.0630879185291415
It is essential that we get the mix right.	1.078419887060172
Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his statement.	1.2721173561914734
I would like to welcome the division of labour that you have made and that food management will remain the responsibility of the European institutions, including the Commission and Parliament.	1.4386006203047934
That is very much the right approach.	1.1243200787153727
But there is one word that I have not heard you mention here tonight.	1.4288108162406155
I hope that we can thrash this out.	1.1085354569085633
We need a body of food law, as you have said, and we need to agree this together.	1.4839197850557302
It is very important that we include liability in that process.	0.9208911153560568
That is the one word I am talking about.	1.32338168749127
The problem so far is that taxpayers paid when something went wrong.	0.846432079889076
That cannot continue.	0.34641859728757707
When we have a crisis we have to clearly identify in advance that if there is a problem, those responsible are liable.	1.3948513874776483
Mr President, it is a very worthwhile White Paper and you will not hear a word from me on the food safety authority.	1.3592066244410559
My questions relate to the positive list for animal feed.	0.839762632233699
You are unclear about this in your White Paper.	0.7549689326730791
What is your schedule, how long will it take you to produce a positive list?	1.1117450433677627
When will the same requirements be applied to animal feed and the production thereof as apply to the production of food and the monitoring thereof?	1.1716939587711233
The final part of my question is as follows: when will BSE testing be binding in all Member States?	1.0776059520391177
That is another point, i.e. the question of obligation, which you were somewhat unclear on in your White Paper.	1.2510521244302386
Thank you, Commissioner, for your statement.	1.1788515631924315
I think the lines that you have set up regarding the Food Safety Authority are a recognition of reality.	1.2028418057586974
The Member States would not accept a regulatory agency, so there is not very much point in your proposing one.	1.5218212371454443
Some sectors of the food industry clearly need better regulation and that is clear on the issue of feed and animal feedingstuffs.	1.1437250158823131
However, as chairman of a committee which looks as though it will be concerning itself almost entirely with food over the next three years, I have to ask: if Europe has the safest food control system, as you have said, why do we need 24 new directives and regulations and 20 new amending directives?	1.3752621762293493
Secondly, will this not compound the problem of over-regulation from Brussels and under-implementation in the Member States?	1.4355770660360487
We look forward to a fruitful dialogue with you on this.	0.9556410729385679
Regarding enlargement: what plans does the Commission have to involve the applicant states in debates on these new laws, given that the Commission clearly expects the laws envisaged in the White Paper to form part of the acquis communautaire by 2003?	1.1607424330066514
President, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Ahern, Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mrs Jackson for their words of support in relation to the White Paper.	1.302659794082495
I find that encouraging and I look forward to further discussions with them and other Members of Parliament in relation to the issues that they raised.	1.389033526695629
Mrs Ahern raised the issue of liability.	0.6230864296846474
That of course is not specifically addressed in the White Paper except for the reference to the fact that we will be putting in place provisions - and there are already some - relating to the issue of traceability.	1.335255936759952
Once that is done, issues such as liability can be addressed.	0.8741441433382754
I have not given full and detailed consideration to issues relating to and surrounding questions of liability despite my background, but it seems to me that there may very well be subsidiarity issues involved.	1.281833655538772
But I have taken on board your suggestion and I will give it further consideration.	1.5549203424232203
Mrs Roth-Behrendt asked me about establishing a positive list.	0.9002401242052277
That is one of the issues that we address in the annex to the legislation, and the intention is to establish a positive list for feed material.	1.342227006390562
At the moment the list is, as I say, a negative list and it is added to as required.	1.5564188507865424
The establishment of the positive list is one of the issues set out in the annex with a date attached to it, 2002 in fact.	1.1628998628358922
The rapid alert system for feed is something that we have identified as a gap in the legislation.	1.0851273361709641
Rapid alert is there for food but not for feed.	0.9589664972436395
This is unfortunate and it is wrong, and we believe that it is important to identify it and to establish legislation to close that gap and that will be done.	1.3661639233574663
The work in relation to BSE in Member States and the establishment of random testing to identify levels of infectivity in Member States is ongoing, I know that Mrs Roth-Behrendt has asked me this question before and I said I thought it was coming along quickly but I understand it is in inter-service consultation in the Commission and work is currently under way.	1.3661689096597824
I hope that the next time you ask me the question, I will be in a position to give you more detailed information.	1.4115907690637441
Mrs Jackson has focused on the fact that there are 24 new and 20 amending pieces of legislation and asks whether this compounds over-regulation.	0.9771959033842771
I should say that the pieces of legislation that we have identified are intended to close gaps in existing legislation.	1.123367127611558
It is not so much a matter of the establishment of new regimes or further regulation, although that is part of it, but of identifying where there are gaps and loopholes in the chain from farm to table and closing them.	1.3268373984860626
There is a reference to applicant states and that is something that we have in mind.	1.3626043977570845
Standards of food safety and indeed other areas of safety are obviously of critical importance in relation to enlargement and this is a matter that I have drawn to the attention of Mr Verheugen.	1.296816846111663
Commissioner, the ignorance of certain Member States has landed us in a major food crisis here in Europe, and I am afraid that once more I have cause to be angry at the fact that again no Members of the Council are in attendance, and that on the day that you present your interesting report.	1.4577877496700793
What I would very much like you to tell me is how you intend to guarantee that a new authority of this kind, whatever name it goes by, will be given influence over the Council, who in this authority will have the say in matters, and who will issue orders.	1.4297106533120776
Of course, we are not in a position to dictate anything in terms of content, but I would insist on Parliament retaining the rights accorded it under Maastricht and Amsterdam, and even extending them.	1.3434856852435553
I very much fear that we are to have yet another authority that flies through Europe anonymously like a satellite; an authority of this kind would be anathema to me and I hope it does not come to that.	1.2973685264351833
I also welcome the White Paper.	0.7549427470089042
But do you envisage that the Food Safety Agency will have enough teeth to prevent something like the beef war that we have had and France's refusal to lift the ban?	1.2402051287678624
You mentioned the Commission being able to withhold grants and subsidies from countries who are acting in the way that France is acting.	1.1098214454073947
Would you also propose that the Commission could give interim payments for instance, similar to the one that the British farmers are asking for at the moment?	1.3680959596662758
Mr President, you said during last week' s information session that it was your view that any future EU food agency should not be located on the periphery, but you did not mention what that periphery was.	1.4133949567599777
For example, the work of the EU unit located in Dublin has shown that physical distance is no barrier these days to communication and having an effective influence on matters.	1.1704258205358427
It has been suggested that the most important tasks of a future food authority will be to gather, publish and coordinate data, make recommendations for improved food safety, and - as you said - collect scientific data and popularise that information for consumers.	1.311855642288444
All this will be managed with the help of modern technology in any area of the European Union.	1.1318618735467025
I would ask you on what you base your ideas for a location?	1.1591057541283607
In relation to the makeup of the authority: first of all it will employ in-house scientists who will liaise with and consult with scientists who are experts in the particular field that is being considered at any particular time.	1.2609507054148614
In addition to that, the food safety authority will have a board.	1.3262341451929542
You will notice in the White Paper that we have not been specific about the makeup of that board.	1.0725834668668188
This is an issue which I expect will be discussed between Parliament and the Commission over the next few weeks and months.	1.2417151848129497
I envisage that the board's membership will be made up from stakeholders or representatives of stakeholders.	1.0067783105433992
Its function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal I will bring to the Commission in September.	1.4789683873302797
We have not done that yet but it will be done in September.	1.2791384676595585
I do not expect that the board will have any function in directing the scientists how to do their work.	1.1653974623268428
That would erode the independence of the scientific advice.	0.842018608410152
But it would have an overall remit, particularly, for instance, in requesting the authority to investigate particular areas requiring research.	1.4171731533105443
Mr Florenz asks whether Parliament will have a say in that.	0.9611640303806226
That is an issue for consideration and discussion.	1.1259443247703123
There may be a number of views on that.	0.9697389163600656
Some may take the view that it would be inappropriate for Parliament or Members of Parliament - or indeed Parliament nominees - to be members of the board.	1.3748456331720162
Others may take the view that it would be a valuable exercise if Parliament, through nominees or even MEPs themselves, were able to have an opportunity to discuss what issues should be investigated.	1.2308618912493419
It is an issue for consideration but it has not been ruled out.	1.3985342832843506
Mr Florenz also raised the question of anonymity.	0.8566970861304698
I am happy that he raised it because it is particularly important for this authority to have a high profile.	1.2382465016308826
It must be visible.	0.5850147454036285
It must be known.	0.8576268139442277
Consumers in the European Union must know of the existence of the food authority.	1.3127211649816943
The CEO of the authority would be somebody who typically would be known, who might appear regularly on television talking about issues relating to food, particularly in relation to the good news stories surrounding food in relation to nutrition, diet and such issues, so that if another food crisis comes along consumers will be aware of the existence of the authority.	1.2508306706208545
They will be aware that they have heard from the authority before under other circumstances and hopefully will have some bedrock of confidence already built up in the pronouncements from the authority.	1.1046826746378045
It is fundamentally essential therefore that the authority is not anonymous.	1.0517660524473535
It must be visible.	0.5850147454036285
I will do everything I can to promote that high profile role for the authority.	1.1175198184885708
Mrs Lynne asks whether the authority will have sufficient teeth.	0.9915056076559418
I suspect that the question is focused on the issue of where the competence of the authority begins and ends and where the competence and authority of food safety agencies in Member States begin and end.	1.1979637209434015
There would have to be an interaction at scientific level.	1.176115519471874
Quite clearly it is undesirable to have situations develop whereby scientists working for, or advising, the food safety authority at Community level may be in disagreement with some scientific opinion at Member State level.	1.1009637764202571
That is an undesirable situation, we do not want that situation in the future.	1.3970167217097675
There are a number of things that undermine consumer confidence - lack of information is one.	0.9509845088553813
But information which includes a fundamental disagreement between scientists on core issues relating to food safety is also an issue of serious concern.	1.102503222781002
We must attempt to avoid that and establish the structures so as to ensure that there is a proper dissemination of information between scientists, that there is full consultation and discussion and that the authority at Community level has the opportunity and is mandated to seek the advice and opinion of independent scientists in all Member States and indeed maybe even beyond, where experts are to be found elsewhere.	1.3026513520930225
Over time, as I said a moment ago, not only will the profile of the authority be raised but its expertise, its moral authority will be increased and enhanced over a period of time so that its views are accepted and not challenged.	1.3302428894587748
This situation can be achieved over a period of time.	0.8461916014951999
You cannot legislate for consumer confidence. It is something that is earned over a period of time.	1.1254708137837284
However, the Commission will have the possibility of seeing that the opinions of the Authority on scientific matters are enforced by way of passing legislation which is the function of the Commission, Parliament and Council.	1.3800476805150776
I realise that this is a somewhat time-consuming exercise but, nonetheless, the establishment of legislation arising out of the opinions of the Authority is - I believe - the way forward.	1.4333484335808462
Any failure to comply with legislation is a matter that can be dealt with in the courts in the normal way.	1.137175246805372
One of the issues that we may have to address over time is the question of the speed of response in such circumstance.	1.2173616202031368
I hope to see if something can be put in place to get us a faster response from the court process.	1.1323385752941582
In relation to grants and subsidies: yes, consideration has been given to that issue.	0.932550175947578
It will require the advice of legal services and that will be sought, particularly bearing in mind that it may provide a speedy response to a failure to comply with Community law pending a court ruling.	1.227349910250838
In relation to Mrs Lynne's question on interim payments: that is a matter that might very well be addressed by Parliament as it relates to budget issues.	1.3182192624367253
Mrs Myller then asked me about the location of the Authority.	0.8001712541535788
No decision has been taken in relation to that other than to say that it is more likely that the Authority will be located centrally rather than on the periphery.	1.176285799436797
I recognise that the FEO is located in Dublin and, although I come from that part of the world myself, I have to accept that it is not the centre of Europe!	1.6238824910038268
But the FVO is in quite a different situation from the Food Safety Authority.	0.8813800677611889
The FVO is made up of independent scientists and vets and so on who travel from some location where there is an airport - quite clearly we have an airport in Dublin.	1.2300651768139765
The Food Safety Authority's situation is quite different.	0.9297964730197537
It has to be close to the Commission because of the need for interaction between the scientists involved in the Food Safety Authority and those of us who are involved in the initiation of legislation.	1.1999248531872573
An important part of the communication between the two institutions will obviously be to ensure that those of us who are involved in the drafting of legislation understand clearly and perfectly what it is the scientists mean, what problems they have identified, what legislation is necessary to deal with the issues they raise.	1.3419931719036025
Equally, the scientists will wish to have some input into the legal process or the policy-making process or the law-drafting process, to ensure that the legislation meets the ills that they have identified.	1.3444792532803376
It seems to me desirable for an authority of this type to be centrally located.	1.1276850158034242
Scientists will be employed in-house but it will also be necessary to liaise with scientists on a consultative basis and, in those circumstances, as scientists will have to travel, it is probably better that they move to a central location, once again where the parliamentary structures and the Commission and Council are based.	1.4725455874839104
That is my judgement at the moment.	1.0318610662352143
It may be a matter for discussion here and elsewhere and I will listen to any suggestions that are made but my preliminary conclusion is that this Authority should be located centrally rather than on the periphery.	1.1294108421706703
Colleagues, I am in a very difficult position because I cannot change the agenda.	1.4909692056895658
I would suggest to you to take this matter up with your political groups and raise it in the Conference of Presidents.	1.2665118806165552
If you feel that these sessions after a Commission statement are important, I would suggest that we require more time than the half-hour that is allocated to them.	1.2732963543566982
On this occasion we have had six minutes of questions from the floor of the House and we have had 29 minutes of response by the Commissioner, and his statement.	1.6513455013607146
As you can see, half-an-hour is not really anything like enough time for such a session.	1.0272625318471054
I hope you might discuss this in your political groups so that we can have a better structured session with the Commission on such future occasions.	1.417382464795487
That concludes the debate.	0.19308667519260808
Question Time (Commission)	0.3763026442786636
The next item is Question Time (B5-0003/2000). We will examine questions to the Commission.	0.9915140624595835
We will dedicate approximately one hour and fifteen minutes to Question Time.	0.6638029039441679
We will cut back our time a little because the interpreters are working today in continuous session.	0.9482585686472215
Mr Purvis has the floor for a procedural motion.	0.5869797966615448
I object to the fact that we are cutting back the time for Question Time; it is one of the few occasions when backbenchers have a chance to get their time on the floor and I do ask you to extend it to one and a half hours as is on the agenda.	1.235760583828932
That is the agenda and I think that we should stick to the agenda.	1.5162193554202799
The fact is that the agenda said that we would begin at 5.30 p.m., and you can see the clock.	1.4066867511326118
I hope that we do not go on into the evening session in any event.	1.5278417201898846
First Part	-0.0
Question No 28 by (H-0781/99):	0.7677543773981416
Subject: Construction of nuclear plant in earthquake-prone Turkey The two recent earthquakes in Turkey registering more than 7 on the Richter scale raise tremendous doubts about Turkey's persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at Akkuyu, while energy reserves produced by the Atatürk dams are exported to third countries and the EU spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes.	0.5410005525470423
Turkey's nuclear plans ? which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of Turkey and the surrounding region ? prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by Turkey's political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons, as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of Canadian origin of the type acquired by India and Pakistan.	0.6670729390043211
What steps will the Commission take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the EU but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the EU budget?	0.5970042528251284
Mr Verheugen has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	0.6595928627255191
The Commission is following with interest the planned construction of a nuclear power plant in Akkuyu, Turkey and recognises the importance of ensuring that the construction of the new plant follows the highest internationally accepted nuclear safety standards.	1.280620494403592
According to our information, the decision on the selection of a bidder has not been taken yet.	1.2177314194221283
The Commission acknowledges the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the convention on nuclear safety and recognises that the responsibility for granting licences and regulating the siting, construction, commissioning, operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants in Turkey rests entirely with the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority.	0.9686881147572305
The Commission does not have a mandate to impose any limits on decisions taken by any country in terms of energy production, including the nuclear option.	1.2001899000827234
As Commissioner Wallström indicated during the hearings in the European Parliament in September 1999, the Commission will bring up the issue of nuclear safety and radiation protection in any relevant meeting with the Turkish Government in the future and I am happy to inform you that I will have a meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister in a couple of days and will certainly raise the issue.	1.5011776829152899
In particular, the Commission is aware of the public concerns about the recorded seismic activity in the area of the Ecemis fault line located in the vicinity of the proposed plant site.	1.2163001222243675
According to information received from the International Atomic Agency, the design of the plant takes into account the possibility of earthquakes stronger than any ever recorded in the area and particularly more than ten times stronger than the one registered in June 1998 in Adana.	1.205235431458352
Large design margins are being provided in order to ensure safe operation of the plant according to the environmental conditions of the site.	1.2457063995337339
The Commission is also aware of concern about the possible intention of using the plant to produce weapons-grade material.	1.1785681813572224
It acknowledges the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and has subsequently concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency.	1.1328542484680522
Thank you for your reply.	0.5091778424529624
I should like to make the following points: Turkey is now a candidate country.	1.3155787615806656
This plan is designed to increase its energy potential by 2%.	0.5442858616029295
At the same time, it also wishes to acquire Cadou type reactors from Canada, which we now know have already been used for nuclear weapons in Pakistan and India.	1.3098340107267397
In this sense, there is therefore a serious risk that some idiot will decide that the new geopolitical balance of power in the Caucasus calls for a nearby country with weapons grade nuclear technology.	1.2729830399160598
So much for the political aspect.	0.8272126394476219
Now to the technical aspect. The safety factor in this type of project, and I am speaking as an engineer, has nothing to do with increasing safety levels in relation to the risk of collapse by a factor of ten or twenty.	1.347840910101927
In cases such as this, where there is uncertainty, simulators are used.	0.977019386937959
However, we cannot used simulators in cases relating to nuclear energy.	1.2745375062819355
In this sense, all high seismic risk areas must be excluded a priori for nuclear installations such as this.	1.0028180693075663
Therefore, and given that the relationship between the European Union and the Commission and Turkey has now changed, it would be a good idea if Turkey discussed certain matters relating both to the safety of the area in general and the peaceful development of Turkey within the European Union.	1.5120253663471217
A couple of weeks ago we had a debate in Parliament on the nuclear safety issue with special regard to the candidate countries.	1.1768986654695606
I have explained the position of the Commission.	0.8173956429043258
You have to accept the fact that there is no acquis communautaire on nuclear safety.	1.2068419079983626
So what we did was use political means to convince some candidate countries that we have to have decommissioning plans for some reactors that are considered not to be upgradable.	1.18583389803314
In the case of Turkey it is different.	0.9247275180042015
The plant is not yet there.	0.9339130148469194
I have already said that Turkey is part of the NPT and of the Convention on Nuclear Safety.	1.102051484536281
If we see in the development of that nuclear power plant that there are concerns about safety we will discuss it with Turkey.	1.1373721598967468
If the conclusion is that Turkey is planning to build a nuclear power plant that does not meet normal European safety standards is concerned then we would do the same as we did with Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria.	1.0958083094053335
Mr President, the Commissioner said that Turkey has signed the non-proliferation treaty, it has signed the nuclear safety treaties: why should there be any doubt at all but that Turkey's nuclear plant should not be just as safe as any in the Community, and would the Commissioner be prepared to take a rather more robust position with Mr Souladakis on this matter?	1.4236581995033397
I think it is the right of a Member of Parliament to raise his own concerns and fears.	1.5732564874064126
I do not have these concerns.	1.2447874744688392
I believe that Turkey completely recognises the standards and the criteria of the convention on nuclear safety and the non-proliferation treaty, but there is no doubt that there are concerns in the public in Europe and I think it is quite right to discuss them here in Parliament.	1.5122464360451822
Question No 29 by (H-0786/99):	0.7501147591685661
Subject: Depleted uranium weapons Has the Commission conducted any studies of the potential effects upon EU states of transboundary pollution arising from the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Kosovan conflict?	1.044740685696103
If not, why not?	0.616959217326673
Mrs Wallström has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	0.7314655531081516
Thank you, Mr Bowe, for your question.	1.3445372397198394
The European Commission has monitored the environmental effects of the conflict from the beginning of the NATO action.	1.43345528465754
As early as last June the Commission financed a first study. It was carried out by the regional environment centre for central and eastern Europe and concluded that there had been no large-scale ecological catastrophe.	1.1900288300738324
None of the subsequent evidence or analysis has overturned that original assessment.	0.7508743335535187
The Commission has also been closely associated with the production of the recent report published by the United Nations environment programme - Balkan Task Force.	1.2234676186400948
This is the most detailed and comprehensive report to date on the environmental effects of the Kosovo conflict and I recommend it to those who have not yet studied it.	1.375170391369878
The use of depleted uranium weapons was one of the many issues considered and this report is now widely available also on the Net.	1.096020650439888
The Balkan Task Force was hampered by the fact that little or no information was available on the actual use of these weapons during the conflict.	1.0598225020708942
No indications of contamination were found in Kosovo during the BTF fact-finding mission.	0.7127775169137037
However, this does not exclude the possibility that areas in Kosovo are contaminated by depleted uranium.	1.1866895854196662
From a desk assessment coupled with a fact-finding mission the report concludes that the risks, if any, are limited to an area around the target.	1.1696949120110287
Future actions will take place within the stability pact for south-eastern Europe. A special regional environmental reconstruction plan is also being developed.	1.2583881059773434
It will form the framework for emergency assistance for combating war damage if such action should be needed.	0.9685414897878848
First of all, Mr President, can I thank the Commissioner for that very useful response.	1.4483846470879438
Clearly the Commission has given some consideration to this problem and I am pleased that these reports which have been produced so far have looked carefully at the issue.	1.4219166179058378
But I would like to point out that the concern with depleted uranium weapons is about the way in which they are used.	1.1827234189630091
This uranium becomes air-borne, is inhaled and could now be effectively carried by members of the population in Kosovo with rather more long-term effects than it has been possible to establish so far.	1.2737060371162454
This seems to be the pattern of events that has emerged after the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Gulf war.	1.1087940240395746
I would therefore ask the Commission if it would wish to consider continuation of monitoring and for what length of time they might consider monitoring in future to see the long-term effects, not just of depleted uranium weapons but of some of the other effects on the environment that we do know have occurred at least in a localised way within Kosovo?	1.3682892567918628
How long will you continue to monitor the effects of these weapons?	1.060614419081701
Thank you, Mr Bowe, for that question.	1.3367686404464838
We have to state again that there is still no confirmation that depleted uranium was used in the conflict and no depleted uranium has been detected in the clean-up of Kosovo.	1.2348761278073395
But those symptoms and those problems that you mentioned could be there and that could be the effect of the use of depleted uranium.	1.1234016475126576
That is also mentioned in the report.	0.8636726325425803
No transboundary effects have been detected and most of the weapons will have been used on the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.	1.0739867148552993
The problem is that the current political isolation of the country means that access to this area is restricted.	1.3122012070107947
A big responsibility rests with the United Nations because they are addressed with this report, so they have to take responsibility.	1.386878197918614
But through this regional and environmental reconstruction plan we can continue the monitoring and the assistance we can give and that is, for the time being, the kind of frame we can use for the work of the European Union.	1.3128948415694086
It is important to follow up and it gives the Member States, as well as the United Nations and the Commission, something to think about when it is a matter concerning military secrets and their effects on the environment.	1.5384200561950976
It also has a long-term effect on thinking when it comes to the use of these sorts of weapons.	1.1477891451672202
Mr President, Commissioner, in a few months' time, hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers will again head for the Adriatic Coast to spend their summer holiday.	1.0392251715770606
We know from media reports that bombs and weapons were dumped just off the coast.	0.8402072857914462
Are you able to confirm that holidaymakers will be able to swim safely in the Adriatic this summer, and are there any measures in the pipeline for ascertaining what the dangers might be in this respect?	1.303054973747523
I wish I could give guarantees for many things but unfortunately I am not able to.	1.0457128477568614
We make our judgements from reports like this and the missions we send to check on things like this.	0.8998278476135873
That is what we rely on when we advise people on what to do.	0.9211545007003747
What we have seen is that war affects the environment in the long term and is dangerous.	1.2916865303009202
In the environmental field we have just passed a directive on marine pollution.	1.1112905527491728
That also includes bullets and weapons and so on and it is an early warning system.	1.2353378118758993
Unfortunately we are not able to give guarantees and we can only continue to monitor and try to do the clean-up exercise.	1.2785262566559368
I wanted to ask the Commissioner whether it is true that soldiers of the NATO armed forces now stationed in that region undergo special controls against nuclear radiation and that the same measures are not applied to civilians living in the area?	1.304118148362906
I cannot answer that question.	0.5032908901118593
When it comes to medical checks and so on, I do not have all the information needed to give a proper answer.	1.322046558690767
What we know from the environmental side is what I have already mentioned, that there is now an environmental reconstruction plan, but when it comes to medical check-ups I do not have the information about that.	1.5111369370932997
Of course I can go back and see whether we can find the necessary information.	1.2101149268799931
Question No 30 by (H-0793/99):	0.751525604179121
Subject: Appointment of a European Union envoy for Tibet In 1998 the Tibetan Government in exile received over 4000 Tibetans who escaped over the Himalayan mountains seeking freedom and refuge at risk of life and limb.	1.1529587045184162
Many of the refugees had been severely frost-bitten and many had died along the way.	0.8476712649979226
The Tibet Intergroup is very concerned about the worsening situation in Tibet and it is clear that the current policy of the European Union has proved inadequate to address the grave human rights abuses faced by Tibetans daily in Tibet.	1.2837373919955182
The Tibet Intergroup, therefore, gravely concerned about the continuing human rights abuses in Tibet and supporting the Dalai Lama?s proposal for dialogue with the Chinese Government to resolve the situation in Tibet, calls on the Commission to appoint a Special Envoy for Tibet to address the concerns of the European Union and to help bring the Tibetan and Chinese authorities together for dialogue.	1.2777247882037615
When will the Commission appoint a Special Envoy for Tibet?	0.6634043998859291
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	0.5431039271632084
The concerns expressed by the European Parliament about Tibet are widely shared.	1.1028844489681082
I have long believed in the need to set out our views on human rights issues, including Tibet, firmly and candidly to the Chinese authorities.	1.1315228375238517
The European Union did that at the European Union­China Summit in Peking last month where we pressed the Chinese on a number of human rights issues, including Tibet.	1.2652433111394488
We again urged the Chinese to begin a dialogue with the Dalai Lama.	0.7636792339603595
I urge the Chinese again to do so.	0.9885675870675832
We will continue to raise Tibet with the Chinese authorities.	0.7498675920089198
We are also doing a number of other things: in the European Union-China human rights dialogue, we have focused on a number of practical steps, including sending experts on assignment to Tibet, planning development assistance programmes and activities focusing on health, education and training for Tibetans.	1.3256137720190349
The appointment of an EU special envoy for Tibet would be primarily a matter for the Council to decide and Parliament might care to take the issue up directly with them.	1.1454914913752177
But for my part, I am not sure that it would add much practical value to our efforts.	1.2591153768353531
It would be unlikely to have much impact on the Chinese authorities and we already have effective channels of communication with the Tibetan community in exile.	1.1269692864645007
I am also keen to guard against an exponential growth in the number of special envoys, however worthy the cause.	1.2028864077282864
Mr President, Mr Patten, of course, you are very well-qualified to comment on account of the time you spent in China, and you are well aware of how hard the Tibetans are trying to initiate a debate, something which has always been blocked hitherto.	1.3700711361146962
However, if your response was to be that we should turn to "Mr CFSP" , that is, to Mr Solana, then I fear that this would constitute a one-sided approach to an external policy matter.	1.4690704851754515
Your approach, which I am very much in favour of, since it is a coherent one, takes its inspiration from the issue of human rights; I wholeheartedly agree that we must embrace the cause of human rights.	1.4323502496419092
Imprisonment, torture, the mutilation of young women and so on and so forth, are definitely issues that we could discuss ad infinitum.	1.343836335677337
If we cut down here and say that the Council now shares responsibility for this, then I fear that these human rights issues will not be given the attention they deserve.	1.21246839888853
The possibility of stressing the importance of business and trade in the first place, but also making very sure that we include human rights in the equation, would be a step we should take in tandem with the European Commission, rather than saying that it is a matter for the Council.	1.5080572517417108
Let me make clear to the honourable Member what the position is.	1.014549591880363
I stated nothing but the truth when I said that the appointment of special envoys was a matter for the Council.	0.9490325921990812
As it happens, we deal with the budgetary consequences, the Council makes the appointment.	1.421815214740237
Some may think that the budgetary point should be looked at in due course.	0.936865829244947
Putting that on one side, because that is the situation, it does not mean that we do not have a view and a competence in human rights issues.	1.4091785221988211
I am very much hoping in the next few months that the Commission will be able to produce a communication on human rights pointing out, among other things, that there is no disjunction whatsoever between a regard for human rights in China or other places in the world and the trading and commercial interests and other interests of the European Union.	1.3265791412596393
I have long believed that we should all recognise that countries where it is best to do business are countries that treat their own citizens most decently - everywhere in the world.	1.1116929488052354
I repeat that we have made our position known to the Chinese on Tibet.	1.3534033795891933
During the few months that I have been a Commissioner that has happened twice, first of all in New York at our meeting with Minister Tang and most recently at the meeting in Peking and we will continue to make that concern manifest.	1.2290850077609345
If I can make a literary commendation to the honourable Member, who I recognise is interested in these subjects, I recommend to him a book published just before Christmas written by Isabel Hilton, the distinguished journalist, on the problems of Tibet.	1.244805278385424
Mr President, I would like to start my additional question with the Tibetan greeting, which betokens peace and happiness.	1.2387367624440662
We are not just talking about human rights and the environment where Tibet is concerned, rather it is about a unique cultural heritage that is also able to communicate important values such as peace, serenity, compassion - as the Dalai Lama would say - to us Europeans.	1.391860108916961
The question before us now is what can the Commission do to provide more practical support for his Holiness, the Dalai Lama' s, proposal for a peaceful solution to the Tibet affair?	1.223711754680358
I would point out that doing nothing will be the death of Tibetan culture and will mean the end of the Tibetan people.	1.2226397156348883
I have much sympathy with what the honourable Member has said about cultural heritage and about the Buddhist tradition.	0.9522491316548585
Like the honourable Member I have read the autobiography of the Dalai Lama.	0.8749338894137242
It is an extremely moving account, not just of his responsibilities in and towards Tibet but also of his spiritual views as well.	1.4148235218491436
The Commission, like others, has urged dialogue.	1.55980446037855
The Dalai Lama has made it clear that peaceful dialogue is what he wishes.	1.0079503151887503
I wish that the Chinese authorities had responded consistently and positively to that overture from the Dalai Lama.	0.928641331889405
At or around the time of President Clinton's visit to China, the President of the People's Republic of China gave the impression that dialogue was on the agenda.	1.1527231205783992
It would be very beneficial, not just for Tibet and for all those who believe in peace and stability in Asia, but it would also be greatly to the credit of the Government of the People's Republic of China if they were to respond to those attempts to begin a dialogue.	1.4102568800755595
Question No 31 by (H-0795/99):	0.7783364618290279
Subject: Commission's rejection of legislation on proper administration in the EU According to newspaper reports, the Commission has rejected the proposal by EU Ombudsman Jacob Söderman for a citizens? right to proper administration in the EU.	1.1797850065834588
Although the Commission has itself approved the idea of legislation on proper administration, it has not now accepted a detailed proposal that has been made, but has decided to issue a whole set of additional guidelines on improving service.	1.3433848374678112
Are these reports accurate?	0.529647957087251
What is the reason for the Commission?s acting in this way, and how can it explain the resultant discrepancy between its words and its actions on the reform of EU administration?	1.357728073623415
Does the Commission consider that what has happened is compatible with the five-point programme agreed between Parliament and the Commission in September, and is it prepared to submit a detailed proposal for legislation on proper administration in a form which allows Parliament to express an opinion on it?	1.3012908567600785
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	0.5431039271632084
The newspaper reports that the honourable Member made reference to seem to me to be misleading and inaccurate.	0.9250775919570365
In November 1999 the Commission approved at first reading a code of good administrative behaviour to be incorporated into its Rules of Procedure.	1.0315803548152018
At the moment the Commission is consulting its staff representatives on the document, a process which will be finalised in the forthcoming weeks.	1.5016503077104573
The Commission will then adopt the code at second reading.	1.060421053712171
It should be noted that the new Commission gave an immediate follow-up to the European Ombudsman decision of 28 July 1999 in his own-initiative inquiry related to the code.	1.1964089360442067
The Commission would like to stress in particular that, in the drafting of the code, it has taken on board all the draft recommendations of the European Ombudsman.	1.6873977601527934
The code will be a document exclusively dealing with the relations of the Commission's administration with the public.	1.3408876031677046
It will be adopted through a legally-binding Commission decision to be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.	1.2677891687812664
The document has been drawn up taking full account of the provisions contained in the draft prepared by the European Ombudsman's office.	1.2280111909807256
According to the related provisions in the Treaties the responsible legislator for establishing its Rules of Procedure is the Commission itself.	1.3042566701789258
However, it goes without saying that the Commission adheres to the principle of regular political dialogue with the European Parliament on all aspects of administrative reform.	1.3181857165842374
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner.	1.068106001442873
However, I would still like to ask when this code will finally come into force, bearing in mind that it has been on the agenda since 1997.	1.4252312935336162
The newspaper reports were misleading.	0.630883262745957
I do not think there is any difference between us and the Ombudsman.	1.4574814123789275
There is a question about the legislative base on which we have taken the best advice and I think we are soundly placed on that.	1.5275699976399613
I want to repeat that honourable Members, like the honourable Member who asked the question, who take a particular interest in this issue, will want to have a dialogue about it.	1.3516027001140176
It is extremely important and I recognise the concern of the honourable Member.	1.0085452029667208
I want to thank the Commission for what I perceive as a very positive answer.	1.3263975044612613
For safety' s sake, I should like to have confirmation that it really is the case that, where the Commission and good administration are concerned, there is no part of Jacob Söderman' s proposal which the Commission thinks is unacceptable.	1.4747198622343765
Is it true that the contents of all parts of the proposal will be approved?	1.148285311319871
Let me read what it says in my brief - and as it is in my brief it must be true! "I would like to stress again that the Commission has accepted all the Ombudsman's recommendations contained in his draft recommendations of July 1999".	1.5675639683437066
Both documents, that is the Commission's document and the Ombudsman's draft, cover largely the same ground.	1.3032067918394876
