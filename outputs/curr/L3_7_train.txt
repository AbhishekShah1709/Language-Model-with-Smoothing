The present consensus paper recommends diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in HIVE and HIVM and outlines the current research.	0.865413810194739
Background: Prognostic data heart failure rely on epidemiological studies or large clinical trials.	1.1083013221814793
These data are not to transfer easily on everyday practice.	0.9622289250107898
Forty-nine patients (mean age, 54 years) admitted for displaced ankle fractures were observed retrospectively to determine by clinical examination and measurement of plantar pressure distribution whether successful surgical treatment of ankle fractures had led to gait symmetry.	1.167694531368624
The mean follow-up was 36 months (range, 19-54 months).	0.997757725933789
The deviation in gait was quantified using peak pressure.	0.6521452948997278
Using a clinical score, most of the patients had satisfactory results.	1.2078959445721102
The plantar pressure distribution showed significant load asymmetries of patients with satisfactory results and those with non-satisfactory results.	0.9077498477551823
Dynamic gait analysis allows quantification of gait asymmetry and clinically non-visible gait disorder.	0.7956587063447522
Comparison of radiation exposure applied by different types of CT scanners for the investigation of the chest and abdomen.	0.8962669011711044
Determination of radiation exposure applied by multi-phase spiral CT. Estimation of the dose in air in the system axis of the scanner, the CT dose index (CTDI) and the effective dose for electron beam tomography (EBT) and two conventional CT scanners (sequence, SEQ; spiral, SCT).	1.1942508240758918
For EBT, dose in system axis for investigation of the abdomen was above 50 mGy.	0.9462325439535313
Effective dose for investigation of the chest and abdomen was higher with EBT (11 and 26 mSv, respectively) than with conventional CT (SEQ, 4 and 20 mSv; SCT, 2 and 7 mSv).	1.2578384018838944
The effective dose for a biphasic investigation (liver 5 mSv, kidney 4 mSv) was below, for a triphasic investigation (liver 7 mSv) above the effective dose of the investigastion of the abdomen (6 mSv).	1.1984860443505685
Investigation of the abdomen with the EBT should only be performed for certain indications.	1.148277582415985
With spiral CT, effective dose is much lower than with EBT.	1.0022738774132798
Bone fracture, soft-tissue trauma and hemorrhagic shock are frequent complications in trauma patients, and these patients are known to be immunocompromised.	1.0723011859551421
Nonetheless, it is difficult to differentiate the effect of soft-tissue trauma plus hemorrhage from that of bone fracture and hemorrhage on host immune function in the clinical setting.	1.1656813052824575
To determine this experimentally, closed bone fracture (right lower leg) and/or soft-tissue trauma (2.5 cm midline laparotomy) were induced prior to hemorrhagic shock (mean arterial BP of 35  +/-  5 mm Hg for 90 min) in male C3H/HeN mice.	1.2457302916343131
All animals were killed at 72 h after initiation of the experiment and the spleens were collected aseptically.	0.8517324909748172
More significant depression of splenocyte IL-2 and IL-3 release occurred with the combined insult than after bony injury or tissue trauma alone with hemorrhage.	1.0596480060009148
The present study suggests that different traumatic insults, i. e. bone fracture as well as soft-tissue trauma in conjunction with hemorrhagic shock, produce comparable depression of host immune function.	1.0643533846553384
Moreover, combination of closed bone fracture and soft-tissue trauma prior to hemorrhagic shock leads to even more compromised immunity.	1.100554935716753
This indicates that different mechanisms of immune depression may be involved following soft-tissue trauma or bony injury coupled with hemorrhage.	0.9946954629673435
The markedly depressed immune function following bony injury, soft-tissue trauma and hemorrhagic shock may contribute to the increased susceptibility of severely injured patients to sepsis and the ensuing multiple organ failure in the clinical situation.	1.0304961710007823
In the management of acute major vessel occlusion, the use of fibrinolytic agents such as recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), urokinase or streptokinase is widely accepted.	0.9205590152176482
Today, the spectrum of indications for thrombolytic drugs comprises acute myocardial infarction, lung embolism, ischaemic stroke, deep vein thrombosis and acute arterial occlusions of the lower limbs.	1.1611107396776532
In view of the histopathological and clinical features of retinal vessel occlusion, fibrinolysis aimed at early restoration of blood flow appears to be a promising therapeutic approach.	1.0443189617513167
Basically, it is of some concern that the systemic administration of fibrinolytic agents is associated with a haemorrhagic risk.	1.1812697987235814
Since this includes cerebral haemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding, the choice of an appropriate intravenous thrombolytic therapy in a non-life threatening situation such as central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) or central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) should be based on minimising the risk of adverse events.	1.0085093352575711
Furthermore, the fibrinolytic treatment of choice should be able to produce rapid and complete restoration of retinal capillary and arterial or venous blood flow and maintain patency long enough for retinal salvage to take place.	1.0885988786262402
In this article, we review several studies of fibrinolytic therapy in patients with retinal vessel occlusion to determine whether this treatment is likely to improve major clinical outcomes.	1.1425700627451207
Moreover, we review the large scale trials of fibrinolysis in myocardial infarction and acute ischaemic stroke to evaluate safety and efficacy of various thrombolytic regimens.	1.1217412650218759
Furthermore, we report on our results of fibrinolytic therapy with low dose rt-PA in patients with retinal artery occlusion and ischaemic central retinal vein occlusion.	1.3295562900542963
In light of the fact that the occurrence of bleeding complications constitutes a dose dependent problem, we conclude that the use of low dose regimens should be the ideal approach to fibrinolysis in retinal vessel occlusion.	1.1054668612607048
Although the results of our pilot studies must be interpreted with caution, we believe that the administration of low-dose rt-PA (50 mg) in a frontloaded manner ( = simultaneous administration of rt-PA and intravenous heparin) constitutes a reasonable treatment option in patients with central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) or ischaemic retinal vein occlusion (RVO), recent onset of symptoms (CRAO <= 12 h, RVO <= 11 d) and severe visual loss ( <= 20/50).	1.295826891421313
Because of these limitations and the numerous contraindications of fibrinolytic therapy, only a limited number of patients will be suitable for this treatment.	1.1449712204699871
In view of the poor visual and ocular prognosis in severe retinal vessel occlusion, controlled clinical trials are needed to determine the benefit of thrombolysis in the management of this disease.	1.08076208448179
This study was designed to determine the relationship between the electroencephalogram (EEG) and clinical signs of depth of anaesthesia during induction of anaesthesia by slow infusion of propofol (18 mg/kg - h).	1.168749474084653
The object of this study was to evaluate currently published data regarding extragenital neoplasia induced by HRT.	0.9209830482296838
Objective: This study was designed to investigate the differences between TIVA with propofol/remifentanil (P/R) and balanced anaesthesia with sevoflurane/fentanyl (S/F) in gynaecological laparoscopic surgery.	1.3413709995925607
Emphasis was put on haemodynamic reaction, recovery profile, postoperative side effects and patient satisfaction.	1.0384663404945569
Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis (CRP) is a rare dermatosis of unknown aetiology.	0.8674010278411376
Recent electron microscopic studies suggest that CRP is a disorder of keratinisation.	0.8571222660551143
In our case we could not confirm the previously reported ultrastructural findings.	1.0282623175283556
CRP is generally resistant to therapy.	0.6245624442549454
We treated a 19-year-old patient with typical CRP with oral minocycline.	1.020493710001453
Within a few weeks the eruption resolved completely.	0.8816822424441966
A mild relapse 7 months later responded promptly to a repeated course of minocycline.	0.8150642358185951
Twelve months after discontinuatin of therapy there is no evidence of recurrence.	0.927293061311028
In CRP minocycline should be preferred to systemic retinoid therapy because of its minor side effects.	0.8154447085800999
Wound instillation seems to be an easy and preferable way to achieve postoperative analgesia in pediatric hernioplasty.	1.0826202358548374
This prospective, randomized and double-blinded pilot-study was initiated to gain preliminary information in order to define the appropriate concentration of local anaesthetic for efficient posthernioplastic analgesia.	1.0230913953229936
The recommended infusion time for i.v.	0.5753775324682668
prostaglandin E 1 (PGE1) therapy is 2 or 3 h, depending on the dose.	0.9586733565551891
The aim of the present multicentre study was to investigate, for the first time, whether the dose of 60 µg PGE1 is effective and well tolerated with shorter infusion times.	1.285242458240912
A total of 118 patients with intermittent claudication and a pain-free walking distance between 50 and 200 m (3 km/h, 12%) were randomized to receive an i.v.	1.1519905649641575
infusion of 3 ampoules Prostavasin (60 µg PGE1) administered for either 1 or 2 h, once a day for 4 weeks.	0.9945544548613879
Primary variables were pain-free walking distance as well as safety, determined by the frequency of adverse events and the course of blood pressure.	1.042308832587118
The efficacy was comparable in the two groups.	0.5968077830756182
In the 1-h infusion group, the pain-free walking distance increased from 87 to 135 m, and in the 2-h group from 88 to 147 m, while the absolute walking distance increased from 124 to 200 m and from 147 to 238 m, respectively.	1.093153695965923
The differences between the two groups were not significant, although an analysis of subgroups with initial pain-free walking distances of less than 80 m indicated a significant difference in favour of the 2-h PGE1 infusion (increase in walking distance 58 m as compared with 22 m).	1.120585761015679
Course of blood pressure and frequency of adverse events were comparable in the two groups.	0.8603730185116174
Altogether, in intermittent claudication both the 1-h and the 2-h PGE1 infusion show comparably good results in terms of efficacy and safety.	1.149370527749339
Patients with an initial pain-free walking distance of less than 80 m seem to reveal a major benefit after a 2-h PGE1 infusion.	1.003823085352539
The problem in the treatment of deep hyalin cartilage defects is due to the minimal regeneration potential of this specific tissue.	1.0083063526756761
Several attempts were made to solve this difficulties experimentally and clinically.	0.7626216829137203
The proliferative potential of autogenous perichondrium/periost is well-known for decades.	0.9293631220780463
Gender identity change in intersexual patients is rare.	0.6540048118251928

Fractionated irradiation with X-rays or megavoltage is an important therapeutic option in the palliative treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma.	1.0008894245503
We report on three HIV patients demonstrating bullous cutaneous eruptions in the irradiation field.	1.0412757061881843
Three homosexual men (age 45-60 y) stage of disease CDC 3C, were treated with fractionated soft X-rays with the scheme conventionally used by us (total dose 30 Gy, single doses 3 Gy).	1.0601244671995194
Immediately to three days after completion of treatment large blisters appeared within the irradiation field, resolving after 2-4 weeks, leaving postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.	0.9114858585150729
The cause of this rare reaction to soft X-ray therapy, potentially suggesting an individually altered radiation sensitivity, is so far unknown.	1.2266327808329736
Controlled prospective studies applying different fractionation schemes will be necessary to better elucidate this issue.	0.8330077907745698
Due to the decreased trauma in anterior as well as posterior surgical approaches to the spine, microsurgical techniques have been used more frequently in recent years.	1.0802513614229166
This article describes two new microsurgical techniques to approach the anterior lumbar spine for interbody fusion as part of a posterior-anterior stabilization concept in various diseases like spondylolisthesis, degenerative instability; failed back surgery syndrome, fractures etc.	1.0403379307418676
The lumbar segments L 2-5 are approached through a blunt muscle-splitting retroperitoneal technique.	0.8925028817631387
The antero-lateral circumference of the motion segment is exposed with a frame-type retractor which is anchored in the adjacent vertebral bodies with anchoring screws.	0.8988158013282677
The lumbosacral junction is exposed via a mini-laparotomy using a special soft tissue spreader.	0.7702063869451008
Interbody fusion is described with autogeneous bone grafts.	0.6977668065373567
Preliminary experience with 83 patients treated between 1995 and 1996 show that peri- and postoperative morbidity is low.	1.1841638602119247
Clinical as well as radiological results are comparable to the standard techniques.	0.8630854031192825
Spectrum as well as rate of complications so far do not differ from those described in the literature for non-microsurgical approaches.	1.0837177943766363
The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is the strongest ligament of the human knee joint.	1.1970893057750707
Its origin is at the lateral wall of the medial femoral condyle and the insertion is located in the posterior part of the intercondylar area.	1.177684661669966
The posterior cruciate ligament consists of multiple small fiber bundles.	0.6440245370848483
From a functional point of view, one can differentiate fiber bundles with an anterior origin and fiber bundles with a posterior origin at the femur.	0.9818221869996545
The anterior fibers insert in the anterolateral part of the tibial insertion zone.	0.8196009699840443
These fibers become tense when the knee is flexed.	0.4283439169266591
The posterior fibers insert in the posteromedial part of the tibial insertion and become tense when the knee is extended.	0.8480783081219121
The main part of the posterior cruciate ligament consists of type I collagen positive dense connective tissue.	0.8760433300705999
The longitudinal fibrils of type I collagen are divided into small bundles by thin type III collagen positive fibrils.	0.8262229605232644
In the center of the middle third region, the structure of the tissue varies from the typical structure of a ligament.	1.0188803036235132
In this region, the structure of the tissue resembles fibrocartilage.	1.0286108199409916
Oval-shaped cells surrounded by a metachromatic extracellular matrix lie between the longitudinal collagen fibrils.	0.8114227706179373
The femoral origin and the tibial insertion have the structure of chondral apophyseal enthesis.	0.9412096938912998
Near the anchoring region at the femur and tibia there should be various mechanoreceptors which might have an important function for the kinematics of the knee joint.	0.9675688325468208
The blood supply of the PCL arises from the middle geniculate artery.	0.8355866733989813
The ligament is covered by a synovial fold where the terminal branches of the middle and the inferior geniculate artery form a periligamentous network.	1.0432880272437897
From the synovial sheath, the blood vessels penetrate the ligament in a transverse direction and anastomose with a longitudinally orientated intraligamentous network.	0.912108304903122
The distribution of blood vessels within the PCL is not homogeneous.	0.7174948045860535
We detected three avascular areas within the ligament: Both fibrocartilaginous entheses of the PCL are devoid of blood vessels.	0.859689237605404
A third avascular zone is located in the central zone of fibrocartilage of the middle third region.	0.8825337823993985
Atrial reentrant tachycardias (ART) are a potentially life-threatening complication in survivors of congenital heart disease surgery.	1.0734951411639846
From July 1993 to December 1997, temporary transesophageal pacing was used to convert 29 tachycardia episodes in 19 patients.	0.8750998249194706
At the time of the first tachycardia episode, patients' ages were 1 month to 26 years (mean 9.8 yrs).	1.1985400122448107
Time from operation to onset of first tachycardia episode ranged from 1 day to 19 years.	0.8084912374531544
Onset was within the first 2 weeks postoperatively in 6 patients and occurred later in 13 patients (1 to 19 years after operation).	1.1993341873485088
Postoperative pacemaker implantation had been performed in 2 pts; 17 of 19 pts were receiving antiarrhythmic medication.	1.010397128773127
After placing a quadripolar transesophageal catheter, atrial and ventricular signals were recorded and atrial stimulation performed.	0.8214025485605321
Atrial cycle length of tachycardia ranged from 160-380 ms with 1:1 to 4:1 AV conduction.	0.8780127295139095
Temporary transesophageal pacing was performed following an algorithm starting with 4 extrastimuli (20 ms below atrial cycle length of tachycardia).	0.9232777251579862
Tachycardia terminated in 27 of 29 cases (93%) without complications.	1.0871463154555832
In 3 cases, conversion was achieved by pacing after amiodarone 5 mg/kg i.v.	0.8487551329316355
After tachycardia conversion, sinus- or pacemaker rhythm was present in 20 cases.	1.0057608595558198
In 9 cases atrial fibrillation was recorded; spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm occurred after a maximum of 3 min (7 cases) or persisted and required direct current cardioversion (2 cases).	1.1236608595628141
In conclusion, transesophageal atrial pacing is an effective, relatively noninvasive method for conversion of atrial reentrant tachycardias after operation for congenital heart disease.	1.052187537925593
After elucidating the components and theory of neuroticism (N) as well as of psychosomatic complaints and their relationships to personality dimensions and to psychosomatic diseases, comparisons are performed between patients suffering from fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) or related pain diseases with healthy subjects scoring high on personality dimensions related to neuroticism.	1.0344045407101667
FMS and pain patients score high on depression, anxiety, and experience of stress although questionnaire scores on depression are higher in subjects not exhibiting somatic features of the disease.	0.9474004290553144
High subjective pain sensitivity and low thresholds for pain perception are also common features in high N subjects and FMS patients.	0.9314141367003416
On the endocrinological level cortisol responses to challenge tests with CRH as well as prolactin responses to TRH are higher in FMS patients than in high N healthy subjects indicating an endocrinological difference.	0.8761062301057126
A common feature, however, is the lack of adapatability in the two groups, since neurotics are in particular characterized by a low capacity to shift their behavior from one state to the other (waking-sleeping, working-relaxing), to re-adapt to baseline levels after endocrinological or physiological stress responses, or to adjust to conditions of shift work.	1.1863576581034267
This is reflected by chronobiological disturbances in FMS patients and could also explain their maintainance of pain perception, because they are incapable of correcting conditioned pain-producing muscle tension.	0.9114816206988728
Purpose: To document our experience with spiral hydro-CT of the pancreas based on a combination of pharmacologic intestinal paralysis and water distension of the stomach and duodenum with specific reference to tumor detection rate, differentiation of malignant versus benign tumors and assessment of tumor resectability in a prospective study on 211 consecutive patients.	1.1102243879563602
Since the publication of a case of Syphilis transmission by blood transfusion in 1915 the discussion about transfusion-associated bacterial infection is ongoing.	1.0404723249080463
For some time, virus infections through blood and blood products have been highlighted.	0.8407620171978686
However, in the last years the attention required has been drawn to the problem of transmission of bacteria.	1.2969042703375084
In this publication the present situation concerning the contamination rates through blood components and the frequency of transfusion-associated microbial infections is outlined.	0.8735392654927985
The bacteria involved are discussed.	0.5408211012135026
Furthermore, the state of the art for prevention and diagnosis as well as the methods for inactivation of bacteria are assessed.	1.1901672064562396
While working to develop a distal locking device, we analyzed distal nail position with reference to nail deformation and a radiographic-morphometric investigation.	1.065320090685316
The amount and the direction of implant deformation in unslotted stainless steel unreamed tibial nails (Synthes) were analyzed.	0.9012584347489685
Measurement of implant deformation (3 translations, 3 angles) in the center of the distal transverse locking hole was performed with a 3D magnetic motion tracker system before and after nail insertion.	1.2642876977192135
Unreamed tibial nails (diameter 8 mm, n = 10; diameter 9 mm, n = 10) were inserted in paired human cadaver tibiae.	1.0584938291662935
The results showed lateral translations of -4.5+/-3.5 mm (mean and standard deviation, range 14.3 mm) and dorsal translations of -7.8+/-5.8 mm (mean and standard deviation, range 19.2 mm).	1.2947301537133233
Rotational deformations around the longitudinal axis of the nail were 0.3+/-0.7 ° (mean and standard deviation, range 2.4 °).	1.1902606889023515
The results showed, that a simple aiming arm, mounted on the proximal nail end, alone or even in combination with a large working channel (e.g.	1.0482674181612803
10 mm in diameter), was not adequate to the aiming process.	1.281551265605075
A radiographic-morphometric analysis was subsequently performed in 40 tibiae after experimental (n = 20) or clinical (n = 20) implantation of nails 8 mm and 9 mm in diameter.	1.029939822944593
These measurements showed a relatively constant distance between the upper distal transverse hole and the anterior aspect of the tibia (average 12.3 mm and only a narrow range (7.6 mm).	1.150481854381735
These data were the basis for the development of an aiming technique that exploits the relatively constant distance between the distal nail hole and the anterior aspect of the tibia.	0.9877235229670913
The goal of the Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study of Aging (ILSE) is to assess healthy and satisfying aging in middle adulthood and later life.	1.0546069548763557
In addition, this study compares adults from eastern and western Germany.	1.3503482214423048
The data for this study were collected between late 1993 and early 1996 as part of the first measurement point of the ILSE.	1.183538807824605
Five-hundred and one participants from the Leipzig region were compared with 500 participants from the Heidelberg area on four specific dimensions: personality, cognitive functioning, subjective well-being, and health.	1.0531573738567126
Age differences were obtained for neuroticism, extraversion, openness, and agreeableness.	1.0407766474522988
Differences were also obtained in cognitive functioning and health.	0.8232794373806946
Regional differences between eastern and western Germany were obtained in the personality dimensions neuroticism, openness and conscientiousness, as well as in subjective well-being.	1.0208489158319272
Significant age by region interactions were obtained for openness and some of the cognitive measures, as well as for the physicians' health ratings of the participants, suggesting selective historical effects.	1.00407903652837
The results are discussed with respect to functional abilities and levels of satisfaction in midlife, as well as with respect to regional differences that might be due to prior political system differences in the east and west.	0.8869812217494537
Modern obstetrics must try to maintain high safety standards for both mother and child and, at the same time, satisfy the general desire of women for natural birth.	0.8858353922747657
Standards of safety are based on early recognition of high risks, allowing early intervention to prevent serious complications.	1.0083390977427564
A considerable number of diagnostic and therapeutic measures recommended on a prophylactic basis and therefore widely used are responsible for the medical-technical image associated with modern obstetrics.	1.0840726151125686
The benefits of most of these prophylactically recommended activities are unproven or low relative to the unavoidable side effects and the costs associated with widespread application.	1.0158772729922743
There is good scientific proof that routine application of fetal heart rate monitoring during labor and delivery is associated with an increase in the rate of cesarean sections as well as operative vaginal deliveries without any clear benefit to the newborn in terms of a decrease in mortality or morbidity.	0.9930073805635368
In a population of healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies, the prevalence of perinatal mortality or morbidity is so low that even with meta-analysis of several studies the numbers remain too small to show significant differences for these rare events.	1.087765187721976
In high-risk cases the routine application of fetal heart rate monitoring throughout labor and delivery is undisputed and leads to a significant drop in morbiditiy and mortality of the baby.	0.9736544574983554
With careful selection of pregnant women a combination of electronic fetal heart rate monitoring and auscultation during certain segments of the first stage of labor provides adequate surveillance.	0.9695634292182267
We report the history of a 38 year old patient who began to develop mental deterioration at the age of 26.	1.2325709858288272
After a time of 7 years neurological signs like writing dystonia occured.	0.8939207645941252
Hallervorden-Spatz-Desease (HSD) was diagnosed at the age of 36 in vivo with the clinical presentation of severe dystonia, rigidity, dementia, and typical signal loss in the globus-pallidus the reticular part of the substantia nigra, and the nucleus ruber in the T-2 weighted MRI.	1.195669252211653
The "eye-of-the-tiger"-sign, a bilateral hyperintensity in the rostral globus pallidus, was not observed in follow-up examinations.	1.2414238588351338
HSD is a rare autosomal-recessive or sporadic disease of unknown etiology.	0.9736461161098527
In one third of the patients a dementing process is the first clinical sign of the disorder, and is a rare differential diagnosis of early onset dementia.	1.4857192918224569
In 33 patients with chronic venous incompetence (CVI) caused by primary varicoses or postthrombotic syndrome stage I-III (according to Widmer) the therapeutic benefit of 6 months of medically supervised physical exercise training was documented.	1.1279680800491383
During the training penud there was an improvement in subjective complains such as pain and tendency for edema in the legs.	0.8943643072077587
Mobility in the upper ankle joint was improved asuss as venous drainage function.	0.9795948696035676
Clinical benefit was achieved in the reduction of ulcer size; 7 of 10 ulcers completely healed.	0.8907008390544388
Medically supervised physical exercise training and optimized compression therapy are basic therapeutic approaches in conservative treatment in chronic venous insufficiency.	0.8780475828043376
Costs are covered by the patient's health insurance company in Germany, as long as the exercise training is medically supervised.	1.2118247622955909
Epileptic seizures may alter autonomic functions.	0.4870833844312733
This is especially the case with complex focal seizures (of temporal lobe origin) and grand mal.	1.122455412425808
Most frequently, such seizures cause ictal tachycardia, sometimes tachypnea, probably caused by the propagation of epileptic discharges to autonomic cerebral structures.	1.033321913445787
Ictal bradycardia and asystole are rare phenomena.	0.6459528992388682
However, they may be life threatening.	1.5054931466040624
Their differentiation from primary cardiac arrest is possible by the use of ictal EEG and ECG registration.	0.9284087459594716
Postictal serum prolactin measurement does not differentiate syncope from seizure.	0.6418460626125573
However, a postictal increase of creatine kinase is only measured after epileptic seizures and not after syncope.	1.014541533201809
Treatment of such epileptic seizures includes an optimization of anticonvulsant drug therapy and the implantation of a cardiac demand stimulator.	0.9785060692858013
There is growing evidence that ictal asystole is a cofactor in sudden unexplained death in epileptic patients.	0.7913717227353009
A minimal documentation system (MIDOS) has been developed for self-assessment of pain and other symptoms by the patients on palliative care units.	1.142381786520265
To decrease the administrative burden and thereby increase the acceptance of the system an electronic database was developed to facilitate data entry and documentation.	0.9964023807870394
Background: Hearing loss can be found in more than 50% of children with Down syndrome.	1.4255361570382035
Chronic or recurrent middle-ear effusions are considered the most frequent etiology with an incidence of 60%.	1.0578965495608175
Microcystic adnexal carcinoma is a rare semimalignant cutaneous neoplasm characterised by slow but locally aggressive growth.	0.8905777946505954
Its histogenesis and nomenclature are still a subject of controversy.	0.7940328431761258
Under-recognition and the tumour's bland cytologic features lead to frequent misdiagnoses.	0.7319175900956808
In addition, subclinical tumour invasion explains the high incidence of local recurrence.	1.031793817033086
Thus, the tumour makes great demands on the planning of its surgical removal.	1.020440011119906
We report the case of an 81-year-old woman with a microcystic adnexal carcinoma of the lower lip, which was treated by micrographic surgery.	1.2630983430769682
On the basis of this case, differential diagnoses, histogenesis and micrographic surgery as the treatment of choice are discussed.	1.1943524524271287
In old age, individualization processes also simultaneously effect the opportunity and necessity to shape one's life.	0.8313385429503235
Societal orientation dissipates, and the certainties of earlier times disappear.	1.1303658151978115
Plurality and option appear as an increasing twofold challenge to coping with life.	0.757963494776994
These ambiguities characterize modern old age.	0.5246629274379193
Or in other words: the biographization of old age has begun.	0.9792811911737286
Posttraumatic cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is associated with a poor outcome.	0.7369386302129608
When evaluating the literature according to the Utstein method, there were only 2 survivors (0.18%) out of 1,135 CPR attempts after trauma (Table 1).	1.210237576295143
Differences in the study populations and levels of prehospital trauma care led us to analyse the results of a physician-staffed prehospital trauma care system in Cologne.	1.0945219097092378
From January 1987 to December 1990, a total of 49,054 emergency calls were registered using a standardised protocol.	1.0126487908568098
Among 9,595 trauma-related calls, 636 patients were found to be pulseless on arrival of the emergency team, 412 of these were pronounced dead.	0.9601831143720599
CPR was initiated in the remaining 224 patients, who comprise the study population (defined as 100%).	1.0656480116877995
All patients who were admitted to a hospital were followed using a second protocol.	1.1483075643596576
CPR in the field was successful in 68 (30.4%) patients, who were then admitted to a hospital; 42 of these died within the first 24 h. Four patients (1.8%) could be discharged from hospital alive and were still living 1 year later, 1 with a lasting neurological deficit (Fig.	1.2791472521403164
In 156 (69.6%) cases resuscitative attempts were unsuccessful in the field.	1.0680208985793738
Even in a physician-staffed prehospital trauma care system, the chance of surviving a post-traumatic cardiac arrest is minimal.	0.9079379333324559
Survival has to be regarded as an individual fate; the overall results are discouraging.	1.1225919524246049
Even though this study analyses the largest population of posttraumatic CPR ever published, prognostic factors could not be identified due to the few survivors.	0.9914164137004408
Nevertheless, the result does not justify general omission of CPR after trauma as: (1) prognostic factors for survival have not been identified thus far; and (2) no significant additional costs arise from posttraumatic CPR.	1.1275202415111378
Functional voiding disturbances can be due to failure of the detrusor or to discoordinated sphincter function during micturition.	0.7714087271620609
Therapeutical options are directed either to strengthening the contraction up to an adequate magnitude or to lowering the voiding resistance or can be aimed at influencing both.	0.8908022290937462
In a brief survey mechanical, pedagogical, electrotherapeutical, and surgical measures as well as drug treatment are critically examined.	1.1019614004922749
Conservative methods should always be attempted before surgical procedures are performed.	0.8770990095139423
Depending on the degree of severity and the etiology of the disease, a combined therapy can be useful.	1.1667618566659677
In the case of resistance to therapy, intermittent autocatheterism is to be preferred to permanent deviation via an indwelling catheter.	1.0148826312401515
During long-term therapy of hyperuricaemia with allopurinol (300 mg/d) two patients developed generalized granuloma annulare.	1.0561526123972615
The diagnoses were confirmed by histology; concomitant diseases, especially diabetes mellitus, were not detectable.	1.2537823102261147
Following discontinuation of allopurinol therapy, cutaneous granulomas healed without relapse.	0.8236874276669683
Hyperuricaemia could be controlled by low-purine diet and medication avoiding allopurinol.	0.8175898104280181
The clinical history of our two patients suggested a causal connection between allopurinol therapy and generalized granuloma annulare.	0.9218252787992218
For this reason we rate the development of this disease in both cases as a rare but significant side effect of allopurinol.	1.3787044597035991
This should give rise to critical assessment of concomitant drug therapy during development of generalized granuloma annulare.	0.8336176038309467
Background: Aim of the present prospective longitudinal study was the statistical foundation and thus further replication of recent findings of Hasenbring [13], who postulated a significant importance of specific, within the psychological pain research long neglected pain coping strategies as risk factors concerning pain chronification: appeals to "stick it out" on the cognitive level and endurance strategies on the behavioural level.	1.185089229158885
Intraarticular bleeding and muscle bleeding occur spontaneously or as a result of trauma in hemophilia A or B.	0.9482641558154239
The most common sites for hemarthrosis are the knees joints, elbows and ankles joints.	0.9140177960767376
Resorption of intraarticular blood induces reactive hemophilic synovitis.	0.6087119907809976
Hyperplasia of the synovium can be followed by recurrent bleedings.	0.8197800546327386
These early reactions can change to a chronic synovitis and cause cartilage damage, finally resulting in a complete destruction of the joint.	1.0046862261066944
Since 1981 158 adults and 61 children with a hemophilia A or B were treated at the Center for hemophilic disorders Frankfurt in an interdisciplinary approach.	0.9303242630594467
Consequent prophylactic treatment with factor substitution can prevent the incidence of severe hemarthrosis.	0.9862685450525773
Minor joint bleedings are treated by adequate factor substitution, temporarily non-weight bearing of the extremity, application of ice-packs and physical therapy.	1.0139975681318991
More severe joint hemorrhages should be aspirated in order to reduce the acute synovitis.	0.8891660294873679
This is followed by a consequent physical therapy (joint and soft tissue techniques) and anti-inflammatory drugs.	0.9370139307524008
The goal is a sufficient muscular balance of the joint, the improvement of the coordination, and the proprioception.	1.2717524840373666
The chronic synovitis is less painful and poorly responses to conservative interventions.	0.8198837216388489
Local ice application, sytemic and local anti-inflammatory treatment support the physical therapy.	0.8197603545060389
Soft heel shock absorber, elastic and semi-rigid bandages prevent recurrent bleeding episodes by shock absorption and decrease of synovial impingement.	0.8040342148065833
Synovectomy is indicated in cases of chronic persistent synovitis.	0.836569097828422
Radiosynoviorthesis (RSO), which is an alternative in certain cases, has been performed with great success in 12 cases in our hospital.	1.3188744369581358
In advanced arthropathy joint mobilization should be the emphasis of the physical therapy.	0.8622819887803266
Bandages, crutches and ortopaedic shoe devices improve the walking capacity.	0.6878382121850475
Over an 18-month period findings of stress X-ray of the ankle and medical records of 112 cases were analyzed retrospectively as to indications, results and therapeutic consequences.	1.1193414805467385
The analysis showed that critical setting of indications can reduce the frequency of stress X-ray of the ankle and thus lower the total costs.	1.0108190207582761
The introduction of guidelines could be advantageous at medical training institutions.	0.7499519164973184
A 72-year-old patient received 0.1 mg morphine by the intrathecal route and 2x1.5 mg midazolam as adjuvant therapy.	1.1315505545056745
Severe respiratory depression and somnolence supervened 3.5 h later, which lasted over the next 24 h and necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation.	1.146212848991698
Continuous administration of >6 mg naloxone to antagonize the supposed effect of the morphine had no effect.	0.8977222909448767
The patient's condition was not normalized until a single dose of 0.3 mg flumazenil was administered.	1.214771871285684
For the time being, especially in the case of elderly patients, we recommend that strict indications are adhered to when intrathecal administration of morphine is considered and that less than 0.1 mg morphine is given.	1.1875499161314522
Respiration should be monitored for quite some time.	0.7943275292352593
In contrast to the often debated NYHA classification, the determination of peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2) by cardiopulmonary exercise testing allows an objective assessment of the exercise capacity of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF).	1.0638854696035696
However, cardiopulmonary exercise testing is a time consuming and costly diagnostic tool, which requires sophisticated equipment and specially trained personell.	1.291105778429057
Exercise capacity can also be determined by the 6 minute walk test.	0.8026906003244684
This test simply measures the distance covered by strong walking on a hallway level within 6 minutes.	0.8101165432867967
The 6 minute walk test is a submaximal exercise test, which is associated with much smaller increments in heart rate, blood pressure and plasma catecholamines than cardiopulmonary exercise testing.	1.0591370590584976
It is characterized by a very small intraindividual variance.	0.7943951132707784
Furthermore, it can be easily performed and, due to low logistic and personal requirements, it is very cost effective.	1.2497283418794227
The results of the 6 minute walk test - as well as of cardiopulmonary exercise testing - are influenced by extracardial exercise-limiting disorders, such as pulmonary diseases.	1.155042317120517
Independent from the etiology of CHF, the results of the 6 minute walk test are closely related to peak VO2.	1.0433206702471869
In serial exercise testing the distance covered within 6 minutes allow to predict the individual peak VO2.	0.9040123409627986
Like peak VO2 the 6 minute walk test has been shown to be a predictor of morbidity and mortality in CHF, with its predictive value being independent from left ventricular ejection fraction and other potential prognostic parameters.	1.1540205847010492
In CHF patients a walking distance < 300 m is associated with a one-year-mortality of up to 50%, whereas the one-year-mortality in patients reaching a walking distance > 450 m amounts to only a few percent.	1.2694443659266785
In addition, the hospitalization rate of patients reaching a walking distance of < 300 m is several fold higher than in those with a walking distance >= 450 m. Like cardiopulmonary exercise testing, the 6 minute walk test allows to control the efficiency of specific treatments and to monitor the natural course of the disease.	1.1384024463199989
The 6 minute walk test is, thus, a cost effective alternative to cardiopulmonary exercise testing in CHF patients.	1.0010364162109304
However, neither the 6 minute walk test alone nor the results of cardiopulmonary exercise testing alone are sufficient for selecting patients, e.g., for cardiac transplantation, as each individual case requires a synopsis of all relevant facts and parameters.	1.223437422454675
We report the first case of prurigo pigmentosa in the German literature.	1.106102166832207
For over a year, a 16-year old white girl developed an immensely pruritic symmetrical reticular, papulo-vesicular eruption on the trunk, axillae and pubic region.	0.9386077438304332
Histologically a superficial  perivascular spongiotic and lichenoid  inflammatory pattern with prominent pigmentary incontinence in older lesions was observed.	0.8536266336228366
Topical corticosteroids and  systemic antihistamines had no effect.	0.722402912129495
Systemic corticosteroids and diaminophenylsulphone (DADPS) produced improvement but could not prevent recurrences.	0.8182144191523403
Healing  occurred only after 4 weeks of systemic- minocycline.	0.9729436302660368
Following parenteral administration, clonidine has analgesic effects at both cerebral and spinal levels.	0.8259262764185212
Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) makes it possible to determine equipotent dosages of analgesics by relating analgesic consumption per time to the levels of analgesia obtained in comparable patient populations.	0.8837694121033344
Therefore, we studied the equipotency ratios of clonidine and piritramide and the incidence of undesired side effects in the treatment of postoperative pain in patients undergoing maxillo-facial surgery.	1.1971320916338677
The effects of glycerol are discussed in detail.	0.6464333795965561
Glycerol can lead to a transition of crystalline lipid structures within the horny layer lipids into liquid crystalline states.	0.8260870521591661
Especially if applied in oil/water-emulsions it improves, the hydration of the horny layers better than urea.	0.9812856039405241
In addition, if facilitates the dissolution of desmosomes within the superior layers of the horny layer enhancing desquamation.	1.0437255337534082
Furthermore, by using glycerol, the mechanical properties of the skin can be influenced; long term used leads to increased elasticity.	1.3689276349981432
The roughness of the horny layer is reduced, which can be explained by the abrasive and/or the hydrating effect.	0.9614213914292854
Glycerol used in o/w-emulsions also protects against the influence of tensides or noxious lipophilic agents.	0.8051683232996071
Presumably a flux from the base of the epidermis towards its surface triggers the regeneration of the barrier.	0.9447807112910573
Finally,  glycerol can lead - similarly to urea - to an improvement in active agent penetration, as has been proven for hexylnicotinate.	1.473651542801978
Background: An 18-year-old woman presented with thyrotoxic symptoms - right sided lid retraction and exophthalmus.	1.2439164858265215
She complained of diplopia on lateral gaze.	0.5568532584900125
Laboratory investigations confirmed Grave's disease with hyperthyroidism and TSH receptor antibodies.	0.7060284630895163
Atrial tachyarrhythmias significantly reduce quality of life in a surprisingly large number of patients.	1.0886807536528242
The safe and effective treatment of atrial tachyarrhythmias is being intensively studied.	1.1180024305938538
Internal electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation has been shown to be an effective non-pharmacological treatment option.	1.1409384581330422
Cardioversion therapy has been applied in the absence of a clear understanding of the mechanisms governing the process.	0.9779082442994551
Recent measurements of atrial transmembrane potentials using sophisticated optical mapping techniques reveal that internal cardioversion shocks cause changes in repolarization time that favor annihilation of wave fronts.	0.7984721663782126
Thus, mechanisms of atrial cardioversion appear to be similar to ventricular defibrillation.	1.0769371979986084
Further studies are needed to determine whether cardioversion mechanisms differ for chronic atrial fibrillation compared to acute atrial fibrillation.	0.8857406805207841
Plasmocytic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is the most common tumor of bone and bone marrow, typically diagnosed by symptoms such as monoclonal paraproteinemia, proteinuria, anemia and hypercalcemia.	1.085813064311737
In its progress, deposits of amyloids in  almost all organs can be observed.	0.8297008326444735
However, plasmacytomas which are diagnosed by macroglossia of primarily unknown etiology are rare.	1.133693959747121
This case report presents a 61-year-old woman who suffered from a persistent swelling of the tongue with painful ulcerations.	1.1086365861443055
A biopsy led to the diagnosis of primary systemic amyloidosis of the light-chain type, which subsequently proved to be a plasmacytoma with lambda light-chains stage II after Durie and Salmon.	1.1003631196346833
In the course of the disease the patient developed further deposits of amyloids in the whole gastro-enteric system.	1.105361546951681
Macroglossia as a primary manifestation of plasmacytoma is rarely described in medical literature.	0.9463064530816351
However, reports on deposits of amyloid in the tongue in advanced stages of disease are well known.	1.200675174196436
Aim: Improved detection of pulmonary-venous pathologies by imaging the pulmonary veins without arterial overlay.	1.0498490448258408
For the histological verification of suspicious non-palpable small breast tumors, the three-dimensional breast biopsy applied as cylindrical extirpation using the ABBI system is the optimal solution at present.	0.9723939042822124
Because of the possibility of performing mammography during the operation, errors of localization can be corrected and incorrect incisions avoided.	0.857495655948591
Taking the three radiomorphologically leading symptoms into consideration - suspicious microcalcification, focal shadow and structural irregularity - it can be stated that the digital mammography of the ABBI system is more sensitive than the conventional one for detecting microcalcification, but focal shadow and structural irregularity are detected less well by digital technique.	1.0919416550554213
These structures should be preoperatively marked by using sonography.	0.7541097289235686
After the complete removal of suspicious microcalcification checked by digital mammography during the operation, residual tumor might be found in a second excision when histologically invasive or intraductal tumor terminations reach the excision margin (R1 resection).	0.9527032200062225
Thirteen invasive and 8 intraductal carcinomas were found in 80 cases of cylindrical extirpation using the ABBI system.	0.8027771758561182
In 7 procedures carried out to exclude an in-breast recurrence, 3 intraductal carcinomas and 1 invasive carcinoma were observed.	1.0587652721753027
In 8 of 12 invasive carcinomas and in 1 of 5 intraductal carcinomas, breast-conserving therapy was indicated.	1.0385445341545188
Two cases of invasive carcinoma fulfilled the criteria applied (minimal tumor-free margin > 2 mm, no extensive intraductal component) to use the ABBI cylinder as lumpectomy without a second excision to follow.	1.2182402977576519
With the increasing number of patients surviving after therapeutic intervention for congenital heart disease (CHD), accurate and frequent follow-up of their morphologic and functional cardiovascular status is required, preferably with a noninvasive imaging technique.	1.2267698539217669
In a retrospecitve multicenter study we followed-up 30 fractures of the neck of the femur in children aged 11 years (1.5-15 years) for 4.8 years (0.5-20.0 years).	1.3124348213014907
It is the aim of this study to analyse factors possibly related to outcome, like age at injury, type of fracture, interval between injury and treatment, method of stabilization and postoperative interval until full weight bearing.	1.1517553174442487
At follow-up subjective parameters (pain, weather sensitiveness), clinical parameters (range of motion, claudication, leg length discrepancies) and radiological parameters (hip series) were investigated and medical charts and roentgenograms were reviewed using a standardized protocol.	1.2179618240038368
29 of 30 children (96.7 %) have sustained displaced fractures.	1.1408257156714583
Non-operative treatment has been applied in 4 children.	1.0061033925692267
26 femoral neck fractures (type I: 1, type II: 8, type III: 17) were stabilized by internal fixation using screws and/or pins.	1.2032866358005172
Following non-operative treatment one child suffered a coxa vara and another child suffered a avascular femoral head necrosis in combination with coxa vara and leg length shortening of 4 cm.	0.9760997949331285
Following operative treatment 9 of 26 children (34.6 %) sufferred a avascular femoral head necrosis and 3 children (11.5 %) suffered a coxa vara.	1.1180480306604987
In 6 of 26 children (23 %) we observed leg length discrepancies > 2 cm.	1.1643574495815403
We were not able to demonstrate any significant follow-up result differencies between the groups of children who have sustained type II or type III fractures, or between the groups of children aged < 10 years when compared to children aged > 10 years, or between the group of children who were operated on within 6 hours after the accident when compared to the group of children operated > 6 hours after the accident.	1.160638082205968
We observed no significant follow-up result differences between the groups of children who had different intervals between operation and full weight bearing.	0.9037920929929771
Operative fracture management remains the treatment of choice in the majority of displaced femoral neck fractures in children.	1.090803518414409
However, in our limited study we were not able to demonstrate any significant follow-up result differences between the group of children treated by immediate open reduction and internal fixation (interval injury - operation < 6 hours) when compared to children who had been operated > 6 hours after the injury.	1.1817956475942437
Evidence based standards for structure quality in out-patient management of chronic pain states do not exist.	0.9301456022308568
Therefore we tried to evaluate if german standards for outpatient management of chronic pain states which are based on opinions of experts for pain management influence the outcome quality of independent physicians for treatment of chronic low back pain.	1.039959856014803
Objective: The aim of this study was to compare low dose dopamine and dopexamine with respect to of liver-venous oxygen saturation, oxygen delivery and - demand, liver function tests and cardiocirculatory effects  in the reperfusion period during a hemihepatectomy operation with occlusion of the liver hilus.	1.177038824964029
Facial trauma is frequent and mainly caused by motor vehicle accidents.	0.7054700476808371
Due to this main etiologic factor, trauma to the facial skeleton is often associated with serious injuries, commonly involving the brain, chest or abdomen.	0.9194288347180037
As a consequence, the initial clinical management of these patients includes control of hemorrhage and immediate assessment of life-threatening injuries, including the maintenance of the airways.	1.2647041446463294
Patients presenting with facial trauma are initially evaluated with a systematic clinical examination because many fractures can be accurately diagnosed by inspection and palpation alone.	0.8915585842934708
In these cases plain film radiographs serve only for confirmation and documentation of the diagnosis.	0.9977643283563126
In many other cases accompanying and extensive soft tissue swelling may clinically obscure fractures.	0.8237074855463575
A complete and accurate evaluation of these patients requires additional radiological imaging methods.	0.943965974870582
A series of plain films may be generally sufficient but in most of the cases they can be regarded as initial screening methods for more thorough diagnosis with computed tomography (CT).	0.9912873395249682
In trauma patients CT is the imaging method of choice because it shows more fracture lines and displaced fragments than any other imaging modality.	0.9966431595328862
CT delineates soft tissue and bony structures and can localize and even characterize foreign bodies.	0.8495444623814014
A complete and accurate characterization of the fracture type and potentially associated complications is mandatory for the appropriate treatment and can only be achieved by careful radiological (CT) evaluation.	1.120678555232531
On the basis of the claims data of the statutory health insurance funds, surgery rates and small-area variations within the catchment area of the AOK Magdeburg were examined for the year 1997.	1.0676724086606473
Substantial variation can be constantly seen.	0.5857121902312546
The extremal quotient at the 30 most frequent ICPM groups ranged from 2 to 5.	0.7918597910102785
Generally, the extent of the variation was larger with elective procedures than with acute.	1.0328514059661247
Correlation analyses do not show clear associations with hospital bed supply and physician density in primary sectors.	0.8257714754712715
The extent of the small-area variation requires further research to evaluate possible determinants of surgery rates.	1.1278218746556736
Criteria for hospital admission and indications for surgery should be made explicit.	0.9886540537747496
Between 1984 and 1994 the legally required task force "Advisory Committee to the German Federal Health Office in Matters of Approval and Review of Existing Medicines B3-Psychiatry, Neurology, Anesthesiology" analyzed and evaluated the CNS-active compounds that until then had only possessed a fictitious registration.	0.9172440965481272
The evaluation was related to efficacy and safety within the indications claimed by the producers.	0.8317593853286752
Reviews and monographies had to be established for 445 basic compounds.	0.8851452378334222
One hundred positive and 30 negative monographies were published.	0.7099777189845881
"Negative" indicates that none of the claimed indications could be accepted by the committee.	0.9011062249993365
It is regrettable that the Federal Health Agency did not notice a considerable part of these negative evaluations until the present date.	0.8674184285954084
The process of the "Aufbereitung" was stopped abruptly by the 5th amendment of the German Drug Law in August 1994, - a very doubtful political decision with respect to drug safety in this country.	1.1382358854186707
Background: We attempted to illustrate connections between selected metabolic parameters and the inflammation course in patients after cataract operations.	1.1522316908158763
Without a more detailed knowledge of etiology and pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis final conclusions regarding an association between physical trauma and the onset or course of multiple sclerosis cannot be drawn.	1.0124938861098425
Only a few prospective studies which are appropriately designed to prove a putative correlation have been published.	0.9012954045238263
A critical review of these studies and some case reports, in the light of the current pathophysiological concepts of multiple sclerosis, does not indicate a causal relationship between physical trauma and onset of multiple sclerosis or exacerbations.	1.1680796892130092
We report on unusual presentation forms of Pneumocystis carinii infection of the lung in two patients with AIDS.	1.2262533688857393
A 36-years-old woman presented a cavitation in the lung middle lobe and bullous changes in the apical portion of the right upper lobe on the chest x-ray.	1.0874730925688885
The biopsy of these lesions was not diagnostic and the patient was operated on.	1.1387555249569326
The surgical specimen of the removed lung segment showed a cavitary lesion with a border of granulation tissue with giant cells, focal recent and older hemorrhages, rests of fibrinous exudate and dystrophic calcifications.	0.8334986832764164
In the surrounding tissue there were Pneumocystis carinii in the alveolar spaces and also in the alveolar walls, this tissue invasion through the organisms being most probably the cause of the cavitary change.	1.1103497223628112
A cytomegalic virus infection was also found.	0.766433845868599
In aortic atresia, coronary perfusion normally occurs through retrograde blood flow in the ascending aorta.	0.8260768806408679
We report on two patients with antegrade flow in the ascending aorta despite aortic atresia.	0.7123797437635961
In one patient with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (aortic atresia, severe mitral stenosis), an intact interatrial septum/premature closure of the foramen ovale was found.	1.0960570039789488
While no other way of left atrial or ventricular decompression was found, echocardiography, angiography and the post-mortem examination showed left ventricular to coronary sinusoids as the sole pathway for systemic oxygenation.	0.9969282456573051
In a second patient with complex congenital heart disease, including aortic atresia, antegrade flow in the ascending aorta was through a left coronary fistula with shunt flow originating from the pulmonary trunc.	1.0052323773436007
This report describes systemic perfusion depending on retrograde coronary flow due to coronary-cameral (sinusoids) and coronary arterio-venous fistulas leading to the phenomenon of antegrade blood flow in the ascending aorta despite aortic atresia.	0.9674187075142031
The introduction of biosensor technology for near bedside measurement of plasma lactate concentrations has been a promising step for critical care profiling.	0.9296252131621416
However, methodological drawbacks and relevant inaccuracy have been reported.	1.1017408068074077
With the advent of a new biosensor (Chiron Diagnostics) and a revised NOVA Biomedical device, accuracy was expected to be improved.	1.066740397202724
The goal of the present investigation was to evaluate the accuracy of both methods.	1.0184644805832475
The combined histological and microcomputed analysis of human iliac crest biopsies leads to major advances in our understanding of three-dimensional bone architecture.	0.8266698626112401
Microcomputed tomography avoids the time-consuming reconstruction and artifacts of serial sections.	0.8273285964954339
Furthermore, its high resolution allows the recording of structural differences as low as 10 mm.	1.2060984163499284
Thus, three-dimensional analysis in combination with histological evaluation of cellular dynamics facilitates earlier and easier recording of changes of cancellous bone.	1.0703080533654694
The aneurysmal bone cyst represents a tumorlike lesion, which does not occur frequently.	0.8953444404137206
Every site of the skeleton may be involved.	0.9320786130267796
Although it can be observed at any age, it distinctly predominates from 10 to 20 years of age.	1.1529635665578066
Distinction of aneurysmatic bone cysts from certain benign or malignant bone tumours requires subtle imaging techniques and an experienced bone tumour pathologist.	0.8571287395734398
Since the lesion shows a heterogeneous biological behaviour and typically occurs in the growing skeleton, a wide range of surgical procedures must be provided concerning tumour resection and defect reconstruction.	1.0912997748392659
In the current retrospective study results of 41 surgically treated aneurysmal bone cysts, thereof 5 latent, 31 active, and 5 aggressive lesions, were investigated.	1.1565831344251132
While morbidity due to the therapeutic measures was comparatively low even in extended lesions and demanding reconstructions, a recurrence rate of 19.5% had to be observed in our series.	1.1436436547419924
Taking into consideration the biological activity of the lesion, analysis of the recurrences revealed inappropriate surgical margins had been chosen at the primary operation in all of these patients.	1.0769684461661688
Since the risk of a local relapse is linked both to aggressiveness of the primary lesion and to surgical radicality, therapy of aneurysmal bone cyst requires preoperative staging and stage-dependent surgical procedures.	1.140634757620076
The RS3PE syndrome (Remitting Seronegative Symmetrical Synovitis with Pitting Edema) is a manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis in the elderly with a good prognosis.	1.0115331996229187
It usually presents as an acute, symmetric polysynovitis with edema of the dorsum of the hands and feet.	0.6322475842336179
Anti-inflammatory treatment with corticosteroids leads to prompt improvement.	0.8396730086675046
We describe the case of an 81 year old man with a primarily unilateral manifestation involving the right hand.	1.103136192128175
A thrombosis of the axillary vein was suspected.	0.7424424366193838
Within a few days he developed a pitting edema of the dorsum of the other hand.	1.0238285421283257
Movement of both shoulders and wrists was painful.	0.7529035069872614
Low-dose corticosteroid therapy resulted in a rapid improvement of the edema and the inflammatory symptoms.	1.0308704056851077
The objective of this study was to determine the usefulness, safety and acceptance of a new technique of percutaneous implantation of port-catheter-systems (PIPS) for locoregional intraarterial chemotherapy of the liver.	1.1096974725906337
From October 1994 to July 1996, 128 patients (30 women, 98 men) participated in an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program (phase II).	1.0103286547395236
Our objectives were to demonstrate risk-factor modification and increased work-load capacity resulting directly from the rehabilitation in terms of primary results and long-term effects, 6 months (n = 59) and 12 months (n = 30) after termination of the program.	1.2429492891176561
We observed how many of the patients were able to be occupationally re-integrated after completion of phase II rehabilitation.	1.0382144550855092
Here, we present the so-called "Vollmer retractor", which can be fixed on to the operating table.	1.2212233772512724
It allows an optimal transference of the traction force on to the border of the wound, both in upper and lower abdominal interventions.	1.065228647343159
In this way, as shown by our recent experience, we gain an optimal view of the subdiaphragmatic area and into the small pelvis.	1.1835468699629845
The disaster management in Germany is embodied in the constitution.	0.9037937672637504
According to the German constitution the ministries of the interior of the federal states coordinate the disaster management by delegating it to the city and county administrations.	0.9503353413684555
These elaborate and update a special disaster management calendar, which allows a prompt flow of information to and from the administration and the person in charge of operations and guarantees a smooth collaboration on which the success of the operation depends.	1.1407336383369169
The American-European Consensus Conference recently recommended the following criteria for diagnosis of ARDS: (1) acute onset; (2) PaO2/FiO2<=200 mmHg regardless of PEEP level; (3) bilateral infiltrates seen on frontal chest radiograph; (4) PCWP <= 18 mmHg when measured or no clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension.	1.0298557728969395
Pathophysiologically, ARDS is characterized by pulmonary edema owing to injury of the capillary-alveolar membranes and increased pulmonary artery pressure.	0.9661436537506588
It is further distinguished by severe hypoxemia unresponsive to the usual methods of support for respiratory failure.	0.8768849147903522
Hypoxemia is caused by intrapulmonary right-to-left shunting due to to persistent perfusion of non-ventilated alveoli.	0.8055280508705188
Another characteristic feature in ARDS is the low thoracopulmonary compliance.	0.8930966534849859
Latest studies suggest that the incidence of the syndrome is in the range of 3-10 cases / 100,000 inhabitants / year.	1.2554526171220282
Mortality rates are a major concern: old and new reports continue to report mortality rates of 50-60%.	0.9092005619883703
Thoracic organ transplantation has evolved as standard therapy in end-stage cardiac and pulmonary failure.	0.9156429388622361
Meanwhile more than 50.000 heart, 2500 heart-lung and 10.000 lung transplantations have been performed worldwide.	1.088422130030399
Improvements in patient selection as well as in the postoperative management have led to 1-year survival rates of 70-90%.	1.1446480441857991
Long-term results are still influenced by the development of graft vessels disease, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and malignancies.	1.0708066618841037
Furthermore, indications and results of different procecures will be presented and new developments discussed.	1.2282174131272097
The paper focuses on the cultural history of brain death in Germany in the second half of the 20th century.	0.9674615799475615
It analyzes scientific and public discourses on the relevance of brain death and the importance of medical innovations in intensive care medicine.	0.8063509729008614
The paper examines how the public reacted when heart transplantation led to an urgent need for a new definition of death.	0.9729930903514167
It will be shown how the concept of brain death was accepted by the public, introduced into clinical routine, and implemented through medical and legal policies.	1.0246441122475527
Finally, it will be analyzed why the public consensus on brain death was definitely questioned in the last ten years.	1.210468333789818
An understanding of the use of the concept of brain death by scientists, lawyers, theologians, and the public during the last three decades may help to shed light on the social role of science in modern and late-modern societies.	1.1235226838317327
Background: In the course of Graves' disease (GD) the extraocular muscles become fibrotic after an acute inflammatory stage.	1.130619738804779
Differentiation of these two stages is important for therapy.	1.1257585199027393
Injuries of the joints of the pelvis and of the acetabulum are still a problem even today.	1.252090761775988
When the joints of the pelvis are damaged the risk of complicated pelvic injuries, that is to say pelvic injuries with damage to the soft tissues in and around the pelvis, is increased threefold.	1.0636910162825224
The lethality, the overall gravity of the injuries, the probability of haemorrhagic complications and the proportion of associated pelvic injuries are also increased.	1.1120803070194403
Even when anatomical reconstruction of the lower limb girdle is achieved, long-term secondary conditions such as pain and genitourinary and neurological scquelae frequently persist.	0.9715706703190868
Complicated pelvic injuries, i. e. pelvic injury with concomitant damage to organs and soft tissues in the pelvis and pelvic injuries with ipsilateral femoral fracture (floating hip) are special cases.	1.005655907270778
Haemodynamic stabilization of the patient and the treatment of organic lesions must be the first priorities in the interdisciplinary therapy.	1.2108671015144334
Even when these priorities are correctly observed, the lethality is almost three times as high as in the case of pelvic injuries not involving soft-tissue damage.	1.0896971115496674
Acetabular fractures are a particular challenge even compared with other joint fractures.	0.8809641049594179
Operative treatment with anatomical joint reconstruction and stable internal fixation has been shown to have the best results.	1.0879439660369463
In addition to the type of fracture and the personal experience of the surgeon concerned, such fracture-specific factors as the presence of further fractures of the posterior wall, comminuted fractures, joint depression fractures and intra-articular fragments increasingly play a part.	1.207340886254774
The long-term result worsens with increasing number of these additional pathologies.	1.1821885065484792
The primary cartilaginous damage caused by the accident seems to have a considerable influence on the long-term result following acetabular fractures.	1.0698249994609714
Two-dimensional conventional X-rays and computer tomographic imaging systems contribute to the diagnosis and surgical planning of patients with orofacial malformations.	1.2108025368409694
The ability to reformat CT scans into three-dimensional osseous and soft tissue surface images has a significant impact on the diagnosis and management of orofacial malformations.	0.9830135831617313
Cephalometric evaluation with teleradiography provides precise insight into both the skeletal structures and the soft parts, enabling the radiologist to assess the relationship among the different parts in a given subject, at any given time and in relation to the normal.	1.0809594488363925
The purpose of this study was to check the precision of the Dräger vaporizer model 19.3 when filled with three different preparations of isoflurane.	0.9500472353385665
Background: Since there is no epidemiologic assessment of the frequency of pain caused by tumor in Germany, tumor-pain-prevalence is estimated indirectly on the basis of mortality and median survival.	1.2348458349924054
Knowing that about 50% of all patients having metastases or incurable locoregional recurrence suffer from pain every day, the product of median survival times mortality was calculated to achieve the number of patients' days with tumor-caused pain per year (82.710.690 days in Germany 1995).	1.0873686986319497
By division with 365 (days), it is calculated that 226.605 patients require tumor pain related treatment at one day in Germany.	1.092054857377975
Another calculation based on Bonica's publications that 60-90% of patients suffering from advanced cancer are having pain and based on an estimated tumor prevalence 1989/90 revealed a tumor pain prevalence of 221.826.	0.9747303327010781
Laser catheters which run eccentrically on a guide wire were developed for maximization of luminal gain by excimer laser angioplasty (ELCA).	0.8068918266906349
We investigated the safety and efficacy of ELCA with these new catheters plus PTCA in patients with restenoses or occlusions in coronary stents.	0.9235266571683524
The age of standardized instrumented scoliosis correction and stabilization began with Harrington instrumentation (HI).	0.8126726822147571
With HI, satisfactory long-term correction of the frontal plane averaged approximately 50 %, but without notable derotational capabilities.The distraction of the concavity leads to reduction of the sagittal contour of the spine (flat back), which is biomechanically disadvantageous.	1.2530754052525632
The newer multisegmentally attached implant systems avoid this disadvantage.	0.629773567661767
The first prototypes of these systems were Luque- (SSI) and Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation.	1.1893294528732063
Ideal indications for posterior instrumented curve correction are structural idiopathic double major curves and flexible single curves.	0.7832376225864679
However, even with these newer doublerod systems derotation is low, because derotation is, without any doubt, related to anterior release and thus decoupling of the segments by means of disc resection.	1.1935554872841199
Autoaggressive syndromes as causes of diseases underlying chronic blepharitis and keratoconjunctivitis that are refractory to treatment are often difficult to recognize.	0.8901627071960602
The surgical correction of a tandem stenosis of the carotid artery is sometimes difficult, especially if the second stenosis is near or above the skull base.	1.0241400539086774
Angioplasty and Stent implantation may offer an alternative to standard surgical procedures in the treatment of carotid stenoses in the future.	1.0638321568573412
However, the potential advantages of these endovascular techniques warrant continued evaluation.	1.1919470866890247
The application of these techniques in carotid artery tandem stenoses presents specific problems and dangers.	0.9828331759094782
We discuss the case of a 78-year-old man with severe carotid stenoses on both sides and an additional symptomatic tandem stenosis above the skull base on the right side.	1.0240436606344685
After the surgical correction of the left carotid artery using standard endarterectomy, we performed endarterectomy on the right side in combination with an open Stent implantation.	1.3001351516130795
The periungual fibromas in tuberous sclerosis are also known as Koenen tumors.	0.7222706844565288
Joannes Henricus Maria Koenen was born on March 10, 1893, in Eindhoven and died in Bois-le-Duc May 29, 1956.	0.9022641508256191
From 1910 to 1918 he studied medicine at the University of Amsterdam.	0.751663163773372
Then he worked as a physician at the "Coudewater" asylum in Rosmalen and from 1929 in the "Voorburg" asylum in Vught.	0.8871023462120736
In 1932 he published his publication concerning a family with tuberous sclerosis in which photographs of periungual fibromas are shown.	0.7596417762801556
His thesis in 1933 at the University in Leiden was titled "Imbecility in children.	0.8508004975592547
Its Importance in pedagogic and social regard, by reason of an investigation in some communities in Noord-Brabant".	0.9815206932140823
Later he was appointed director of a state mental institution.	0.7265006563087102
The periungual fibromas in tuberous sclerosis were first described by Richad Kothe in Munich in 1903.	0.7002734985465854
Parallel with the increasing number of coronary stent implantation procedures, new or more elaborate coronary stents were introduced into clinical use almost every month in 1996.	1.038616260527075
We have studied the architecture, surface-morphology, and shape-conversion of 16 different coronary stent systems.	1.020020609473178
The objective of our study was to detect possible specific design and surface features which might influence the healing process, instent restenosis, and stent thrombosis.	1.0435271803068176
Using electron microscopy we found ultrasmooth surfaces on 5 stents.	0.695794742279192
All other coronary stents revealed individually varying and partly sharp-edged surface irregularities.	0.753711323675578
Video-based morphometry showed covering between 8.3% and 26.4%.	1.0803498445999082
Stent shortening after in-vitro expansion ranged from 0% up to 10.5% of the initial stent length.	1.2875116394761963
In some stent systems balloon dilation lead to over-expansion of the stent margaine.	0.8360285389781218
This over-expansion mounted up to 20% of the balloon diameter and the stents revealed a rather biconcave than homogenous expansion pattern.	1.0274796287977155
This phenomenon was also found after postmortal stent implantation in 20 autopsied hearts.	0.9678187302616331
Unilateral hearing loss (HL) caused by an acoustic neuroma (AN) is regarded to be neural ("non-cochlear").	1.1068952768986682
By using otoacoustic emissions it is possible to prove concurrent sensory (cochlear) HL.	0.9184342740812919
We prefer distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) because these are more frequency-specific and stable.	0.8277995068921752
From April 1994 to May 1996, we examined preoperatively 24 patients with radiologically proven AN.	1.1501581593606593
Pure-tone audiometry, DP-grams, brainstem-evoked response audiometry (BERA) and vestibular studies were performed in all cases, while special auditory tests (Fowler, Carhart) and short increment sensitivity indices were also performed in 12 cases.	1.0702494333984887
BERA was pathological in 23 cases and latencies were borderline in one case.	0.9146939789015367
After comparing audiograms and DP-grams we found 13 patients with sensory HL, 4 patients with combined sensorineural HL and 7 patients with neural HL.	1.0521094135767348
There was a strong correlation between the results of DPOAE and the results of special auditory test (=0.63) whereas there was no correlation between tumor size and cochlear function.	1.155935592545633
The result showed that the typical HL caused by AN was a combined sensorineural loss.	1.0521020549589701
DPOAE were not suited for the detection of AN but were able to give exact information about any remaining cochlear function.	0.909707836203117
The monoclonal dominant malignant T cells in mycosis fungoides (MF) carry identical TCR rearrangements.	0.8094347512796641
Their detection is a useful diagnostic tool.	0.8378480028386059
Thus, in routine diagnosis we investigated the occurrence of monoclonal T cells in skin biopsy samples of MF-patients by TCR-PCR, followed by temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE).	1.1210597690377146
In 188 out of 208 MF patients, at least one skin sample with sufficient DNA quality for PCR analysis was obtained.	0.9895933726007117
Applying a consensus PCR for the TCR genes VI and J 1/2, we detected monoclonal T cells in 122 cases (65%).	0.9262482987435059
In the remaining 66 cases, we performed two multiplex-PCRs, covering rearrangements of the other TCR genes.	1.2383813807871749
Here we found in 11 cases (6%) predominant clonal rearrangements of VII-IV and J 1/2 and in 2 (1%) those of VI-IV and J P1/2.	1.3310205497344116
In patients with MF, detecting rearrangements of only VI and J 1/2 is sufficient for PCR screening analysis.	0.8440256522125169
In 53 of the patients (28%) the applied methods revealed no monoclonal T cells.	1.133967208382722
This may be due to a low cell number, oligoclonal nature, chromosomal abberations or remaining of TCR in germline configuration.	0.8188687562718887
Despite significant improvements in early detection of hearing losses in children, a relatively long interval still exists from initial concern by families to definite audiological identification.	0.9219212020343751
The aim of our retrospective cross-sectional study was to identify parental factors contributing to the delay of early detection.	1.2566027742469428
The parents of 70 hearing-impaired children were interviewed.	0.750499770618653
All children were fitted with hearing aids in our clinical and had no additional physical or cognitive disabilities.	1.0256896756448608
At an average age of 19.5 months, parents or family doctors noticed first signs of a possible hearing impairment.	1.1328957775044313
On average it then took an additional 7.2 months until hearing impairment was diagnosed by an expert and the necessary first steps taken for rehabilitation (fitting of hearing aids).	1.0404565989867265
Significantly, total hearing loss or profound hearing impairments were detected earlier than mild or moderate hearing impairments.	0.8858745760665105
In addition to hearing loss, parental education correlated significantly with an earlier start of rehabilitation.	0.9971715802923197
Statistical analysis revealed that children with hearing-impaired close relatives as well as first-born children tended to be diagnosed later.	1.0293069671296227
To further improve secondary prevention of hearing loss, the competence of specific parental groups should be taken into consideration.	0.9499913957094538
After the incidental puncture of a sidebranch of the thyreocervical trunk during a subclavian vein catheterization, a symptomatic av-fistula developped.	0.8967689721353932
The diagnosis was confirmed by angiography.	0.4610549808106335
Using a microcatheter system the fistula was occluded with microcoils.	0.7527275151686434
This prospective study was designed to compare quality of life, life satisfaction, and subjective ratings of health before and at variable time intervals after heart transplantation (HTx).	1.0204867105868827
175 patients were included between February 1994 and December 1997.	0.9790420217458314
Every six months before and 1,5, 3, 6, and 12 months after HTx, they received the following standardized and validated questionnaires: German SF 36, heart failure and specific transplant symptom list, global quality of life assessment, Munich life quality dimension list, expected/experienced life changes after HTx, good command of the German language, and a minimum age of 18 years.	1.2752165989080113
During data evaluation, median (Me), mean (M), and standard deviation (SD) were created from individual parameters.	1.2822009492288458
Quality of life was rated as very poor by 84% of patients with congestive heart failure.	0.9545365145553657
Only 6 weeks after HTx, 74% rated their quality of life as significantly better.	0.9829112322050279
Before HTx 80% were very unsatisfied about their health status and 87% about physical performance.	0.9002284889334995
Six weeks after HTx, this parameter improved significantly and 76% were very satisfied about their health status and 50% about physical performance.	1.0382444760517933
While somatic changes expected before HTx corresponded well with experienced ones, psychological improvements were smaller than expected, but one year after HTx they were significant (before: M=3.66; SD=0.9; Range (R)=3.78 vs 12 months postop: M=4.61; SD=0.6; R=2.67; p<0.05).	0.9839525217038263
Quality of life correlated before HTx best with subjectively rated health (r=0.61, p<0.01) and 6 months after with satisfaction about health status (r=0.76, p<0.01).	0.9405779058375837
Only in 25% were expected improvements fulfilled regarding sexual activity/satisfaction, professional situation, and recreational activities.	1.1088515538162327
90% of posttransplant patients reported physical compaints, most by effects of immunsuppression, but were coping well.	1.257125563541267
The study shows that already 6 weeks after successful HTx all quality of life parameters improved significantly.	1.0157936148087876
Despite some unfulfilled expectations and complaints, the postoperative life situation of HTx patients appeared significantly improved.	0.9495171711084481
Sevoflurane is a "new" volatile inhaled anaesthetic.	0.8473321489357685
Owing to its lower blood-gas solubility coefficient, emergence from anaesthesia is faster with sevoflurane than with isoflurane, enflurane, or halothane.	0.977359558591366
Sevoflurane undergoes metabolic biodegradation, releasing inorganic fluoride ions that could produce nephrotoxicity.	0.7254893981850958
In this study, we compared serum inorganic fluoride concentrations (IFCs) in patients receiving either sevoflurane or enflurane.	1.1735311479021135
Furthermore, indices of renal function were evaluated until the 3rd postoperative day.	1.1648195391299707
Background: Rarely, an additional Brown's syndrome develops spontaneously in cases of posttraumatic bilateral superior oblique palsy.	1.2822292101136223
Surgical measures are controversial and problematic.	0.6448208241667851
Metastasis formation is a multistep process that requires tumor cells to progress through many different stages.	0.8478981351398506
One of the first steps is a disturbance of the epithelial integrity through a decrease in intercellular homotypic adhesion.	1.1688038102365637
Proteolysis of the extracellular matrix, as well as increased locomotion, leads to intravasation and dissemination of the tumor cells.	0.9387359829258517
In the target organs metastasizing cells adhere to the endothelium, extravasate and form metastases.	0.8150640206465334
Finally, neoangiogenesis is required for the initiation as well as the growth of the metastases, providing the tumor cells with both nutritive agents and growth factors.	1.339266923934758
This leads to the conclusion that anti-proteolytic and anti-angiogenic substances could provide effective therapeutic approaches for the control of metastatic growth.	1.0157080350523908
Whether or not this goal can be accomplished by synthetic or endogenous drugs must still be demonstrated by basic and definitive clinical research.	0.9285068970957925
Purpose: The purpose of this study was to present our experience and results with arthroscopic resection of the acromioclavicular joint.	1.0950046531833646
Urodynamic examinations were performed in 82 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer before and after radical prostatectomy.	0.9797779631954682
A significant decrease in bladder capacity (396 ml to 331.9 ml), urethral closure pressure (89.6 cm H2O to 65.,2 cm H2O) and functional profile length (61 mm to 25.9 mm) was noted.	1.3443579153814609
The continence rate after radical prostatectomy was 33.4 % after 1 month, 69.4 % after 3 months, 84.7 % after 6 months, and 90.9 % after 12 months, respectively.	1.2661003027463114
A correlation was found between urethral closure pressure and functional profile length and continence.	0.8157111323316695
A second urodynamic examination was performed 6 months after radical prostatectomy.	0.8270928817090869
Functional profile length and urethral closure pressure increased.	0.6620612056633526
These data suggest that restoration of continence is based on sphincteric parameters.	0.7092344497861716
We are interested in the interaction of high-energy ultrasound with biological tissue with regard to cancer therapy.	0.978288651952451
The physical and biological aspects of this are reviewed and summarized in this paper.	1.0540593039809478
The preliminary results give reason to hope, as ultrasound is easy to focuse and might be applicable as a supplementary therapeutic technique in ultrasound-accessible tumors.	1.0182818668050018
The changes observed in biological studies are clearly a function of the pyhsical parameters.	0.8111334210042231
Therefore, it is possible to calculate and predict the biological effects.	1.243182020620054
Recent results have shown the potential of magnetic resonance imaging in monitoring ultrasound therapy online.	1.1128799597735515
The capability of MRI to measure temperature will be an important tool for the safe and reliable application of this new therapeutic approach.	1.242819661889763
The role of ultrasound therapy in the management of human tumors must be clarified in carefully conducted clinical trials.	0.9367257622116579
Posttraumatic deformities after pediatric fractures are either the result of incomplete or failed remodeling, complete or partial stimulation of the growth plates, or complete or partial closure of a growth plate.	1.0866226457762935
In contrast to fractures of the upper extremities, spontaneous remodeling should not be intentionally integrated in the treatment algorithm.	1.3355687954532387
In the context of the quality assurance program of the German pension insurance institutions, instruments and procedures have been developed in the past few years in order to assess the quality of structure, process, and results of inpatient rehabilitation, as well as patient satisfaction.	1.2015910774518526
The routine implementation of these procedures aims at providing rehabilitation hospitals with fast information on shortcomings in their current practice, so that concepts of treatment and - in the long run - effects of rehabilitation can be systematically improved.	1.2585509599311393
When the "quality profiles" of rehabilitation hospitals are compared ("benchmarking"), paying institutions of rehabilitation could gain information on the cost-quality-ratio of particular hospitals as well as important leads for improving the steering processes of patients and hospitals.	1.2592491190468658
In the present article, results of a first "field-run" of the procedures for measuring patient satisfaction and quality of rehabilitation processes are reported.	1.450803703039017
A comparative analysis of patient satisfaction in four orthopaedic/rheumatologic rehabilitation hospitals showed high degrees of overall satisfaction in all hospitals.	0.8582737663421859
In several subdimensions of patient satisfaction, however, significant differences between hospitals were found.	1.1781129020220094
Quality of rehabilitation processes - as assessed by a standardized peer-review - varied substantially between 36 hospitals.	1.1870423401398515
Problems of quality were found especially in some dimensions that must be considered as crucial for rehabilitation, e.g., in the history and diagnosis of disabilities, in the consideration of psycho-social problems, or in the assessment of occupational capacities.	1.2510781947711214
The analysis of THR-failures showed that the acetabular component still is the main problem of total hip replacement.	1.0663556782072814
The acetabular cup fails more often than the stem.	0.7801662125715446
In the midterm analysis the failure rate is a little bit higher in cementless than in cement fixed cups.	0.9730142583443522
The known effect that the failure rate of cups fixed with cement increases exponentially 8 to 10 years after implantation, could of course not be seen in this study.	1.0679791083798007
The success of the cementless fixation was negatively influenced by the diagnosis rheumatoid arthritis, age over 70 and the fixation manner: the failure rate of threaded cups was higher than the one of pressfit cups although the Zweymüller-cup as well as the Link type V-cup showed good results.	1.1755059790993005
The midterm results of the stem were very good for the cementless as for the cemented technique.	0.9644055425405882
Some implants showed compared to others significantly worse results.	0.7266720481348854
The further implantation should be thought of, what partially has already happened.	0.8459114416542003
The results of cementless stem fixation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthrosis and dysplastic osteoarthritis is comparable, so that cementless fixation should be thought of in case of adequate conditions (ability of partial weight bearing for some weeks, age under 60).	1.0713494714113927
Type I and type II diabetes are the most common types of diabetes.	1.1632252869708195
The ratio of type I to type II diabetes is about 1:9.	1.070996616821377
Type I diabetes is caused by an absolute insulin deficiency and is therefore referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes.The disease becomes manifest clinically in childhood or adolescence ("juvenile diabetes"), although manifestation in adulthood is being increasingly observed.	1.2194488661930376
Morphologically, a subtotal ( > 80 %) to total loss of beta cells in the pancreatic islets occurs.	1.2858383944677674
Lymphocytic insulitis, which disappears after the beta cells have been totally destroyed, is pathognomonic of type I diabetes.	1.1407191480823833
This insulitis is an expression of an autoimmune event that is triggered by a multitude of factors.	0.8353870235387184
An important factor appears to be a genetic predisposition (HLA DR3/DR4/DQ8) in connection with as yet unknown environmental factors (e. g., viruses).	1.1049219224225502
Autoantibodies, such as islet cell cytoplasmic antibodies (ICA), insulin autoantibodies (IAA), and/or autoantibodies to the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid carboxylase (GAD), are already detectable in a prediabetic phase, although it is not possible to predict the time of clinical manifestion.	1.214538182279268
The course of the disease is dependent on age.	1.1815674236537461
Young children require insulin therapy sooner than juveniles or adults.	0.635398665531168
This article summarizes data from recent studies on the prevalence, diagnosis and therapy of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children.	1.2452720652367466
The prevalence of this disorder in 4-6 year old children is 0.7%.	1.15361249238671
Leading clinical sign in 90% of patients is habitual snoring, but this is rather nonspecific, as 60% of patients investigated for habitual snoring do not have OSAS.	1.421436449878851
Other signs such as daytime sleepiness, failure to thrive, profuse nocturnal sweating or mouth breathing are equally nonspecific.	0.7523884865741424
The diagnosis, therefore, has to be confirmed by polysomnography, where OSAS is suggested by the occurrence of >5 obstructive apneas/hypopneas per hour of sleep in conjunction with a CO2 of >50 mmHg for >8% of sleep time and/or >1 desaturation to <=90%/h.	1.291875340508048
Patients with progressive cancer and their families face a series of existential crises with each stage of disease up to terminal stages in which palliative treatment is begun, and patients come to accept the inevitability of death.	1.0532274381619038
This can lead to a unique, highly emotional situation with direct or indirect, open or hidden, varied and very personal manifestations.	0.9184748990945704
The dermatological clinic in Homburg was founded in 1945.	0.670750038491086
In 1947 it was integrated into the Saarland University as a dermatology department.	0.7839078052482219
A review of the history of the clinic documents advances and challenges in clinical dermatology, as well as new developments in related basic research during the last 50 years.	0.9239113587848781
The coexistence of carotid artery stenosis with coronary artery disease occurs in a small percentage of patients requiring open heart surgical procedures.	1.0717917299156248
Whether the combined surgical approach favorably influences the outcome of patients requiring major cardiac operations remains controversial.	0.9307689614117651
We report the successful thrombectomy of the internal carotid artery.	0.9437927483017958
A 33-year-old woman suffered from ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome after treatment with FSH/HCG for in-vitro fertilization.	0.9749944005139716
She developed a transient left hemiparesis.	0.6470276274692687
This was caused by a floating thrombus located in the internal carotid artery.	0.761642846205655
Open surgical treatment with thrombectomy prevents recurrent neurological symptoms.	0.8295728520258938
The development of hand eczema is a relatively commonly seem dermatosis in housewives.	0.9468019976791978
In 1986 we presented a first survey of potential contact dermatitis sources for a housewife.	0.8863885513937733
Now, we present an update in which we analyse the different contact sources in the household and grade them in comparison to the data of 1986.	1.205222884854473
The results are based on the analysis of a large population of 2633 patients with the occupation "housewife" and the diagnosis "eczema" who have been seen in departments of dermatology belonging to the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK).	1.1724160016319705
Data for HIV infection on transmission probabilities per contact are of widely differing quality.	0.7782811672116222
Estimates of infection probabilities after sexual exposures are the most problematic, even though sexual exposure is the most frequent transmission risk.	1.1766680880771723
Extrapolations of data from discordant couple cohort studies and from US seroincidence studies may be seriously biased.	0.8072535516982546
Infectivity of and susceptibility to HIV may be influenced by concomitant STDs, antiretroviral therapy, alloimmunization and/or subinfectious virus exposures and thus may show a wide range of inter- and intraindividual variability.	0.9878923700832241
Differences in factors influencing transmission probability of HIV most likely outweigh differences in sexual behaviour in explaining the differences in epidemic spread of HIV.	0.9056934011915032
Between January 1989 and March 1997, 175 patients with traumatic shoulder dislocations were treated by conservative means (median age 41 years, 39 F, 136 M).	1.0419995109013624
In 78 patients (17 F, 61 M) a clinical and radiological follow up (median 50 months, range 6-106) could be obtained.	1.3090981251964129
Additionally, a diagnostic ultrasound was carried out in all patients.	1.2654624586853203
The recurrence rate in the group younger than 30 years (G < 30; n = 35) was 86 %; in the group older than 30 years (G > 30; n = 43) it was 21 % (P < 0.05).	1.2378426502046231
Persisting neurological deficits were found in 6 patients (8 %).	0.9242622621314879
According to the Rowe score, 16 patients (46 %) of the G < 30 achieved excellent or good results, in the G > 30, 29 patients (67 %).	1.2444223946369324
In 17 % of cases, a glenohumeral arthrosis was diagnosed be radiological means.	0.9344765054481304
18 % had radiological signs of a previous fracture of the greater tuberosity.	1.2379105956834011
Hill-Sachs lesions were identified in 19 % of cases.	0.9043189053933383
Rotator cuff tears were diagnosed in 9 % by ultrasound.	1.1682687194986072
No relationship between the duration of immobilization and the recurrence rate was found (P = 0.95).	1.0318185681879946
The recurrence rate following primary shoulder dislocation depends primarily on the patients' age.	1.008770851769593
We analyzed quality assurance protocol records of 532 geriatric hospital patients in comparison to an administration database concerning data on "length of stay" information (LOS).	0.9141289482596375
Doctors handwritten quality assurance protocol records corresponded in 74.25% of cases to administration data.	1.1041642197663066
14.47% of cases were registered with different LOS; 11.28% of LOS information was missing.	1.2683213982647856
The increasing amount of documentation tasks in German geriatric hospitals is discussed.	0.7583473045009322
Conclusion: We assume that not only discrete well known information (admission and discharge dates, LOS) are contaminated by documentation failure but also data on functional status of geriatric patients which may have important influence on external data processing.	1.15823188098422
The majority of patients with symptomatic spondylolysis can be treated conservatively.	1.0519218108762465
Only when symptoms persist in spite of conservative treatment surgery may be indicated.	0.9340862743526467
In young patients, however, fusion of a mobile segment should be avoided, but a direct repair of the pars defect can be attempted.	1.32158957961778
This procedure allows complete healing and possibly avoids degeneration of the intervertebral disk.	0.7900351826150954
For this purpose Morscher developed the hook screw, which connects the arch with the anterior articular process.	1.0477724301828633
It allows compression of the defect without crossing the defect with the screw.	0.9189018931829774
A follow-up study of the first 33 patients with a follow-up time of 3.5 years on average showed a good subjective result in 79 % of the patients.	1.3845735905630423
In patients younger than 20 years of age, however, the result was good in 87.5 % of cases.	0.9795867871401531
The reason for the better results in young patients is that in older patients the origin of the pain is often not the pars defect, but the degeneration of the intervertebral disk.	1.2498945774669075
Direct repair of spondylolysis is therefore indicated when pain persists after 6 months of conservative treatment or there is a progressive olisthesis of not more than 10 mm.	1.0830770145522555
After the end of growth an MRI study of the intervertebral discs should show whether there is degeneration or not.	1.0355856759412998
Direct repair is indicated only in the absence of disc degeneration.	0.8837183414721475
After the age of 25 years this procedure should not be carried out.	0.9920847049171261
We are presenting a 47-year-old woman who was stung by jellyfish while bathing in the sea of Thailand.	0.89329608601816
Immediately after the injury she developed sharp pain and urticarial erythema of the skin of the knees accompanied by muscle cramps of the entire body.	1.0928839636365135
After a few days a toxic contact dermatitis with edematous swelling and ulcerations developed, which did not respond to topical antibiotics or corticosteroids.	0.9342090225470238
Three weeks later the patient presented with a disseminated urticarial eruption, which at first responded well to topical treatment and systemic corticosteroids.	1.1023669562385268
Over the next few weeks, however, a relapse of the eruption and the ulcerations occurred.	1.0801157919048365
Raised titres of IgG and IgM antibodies against different jellyfish from the Indian and Pacific Ocean were detected in the patient's serum by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.	0.9245241690664046
Antibodies against bees (class 1) and wasps (class 4) were found by the radioallergosorbent test.	1.2939675325211268
The clinical features and the immunological findings led to the diagnosis of toxic and allergic contact dermatitis to jellyfish venom.	0.9881378885995071
First aid and secondary treatment of jellyfish injuries are suggested.	0.7876078282863528
The design of controlled clinical trials on prevention and therapy of arrhythmic events is a difficult task.	0.9265313882902338
In particular in ICD trials, false estimations and omissions have occured that can compromise the interpretation of a trial.	0.9488307777503558
Identification of crucial issues that should be regulated in a study protocol in order to minimize the risk of failure.	0.9885379841316865
Evaluation of the weaknesses of completed antiarrhythmic trials.	0.6814006970297473
Problems in the specification of indications and in the estimation of the effective sample size cannot be solved by the inclusion of mixed populations but require the establishment of development programs.	0.9360312049967624
Further crucial points are the appropriate choice of control and the identical concomittant treatment and observation of the groups to be compared.	1.030658867091725
Technical mistakes as imprecise definitions, arbitrary decisions during the course or at termination of a trial, unclear responsibilities or an unscheduled flow of information can be avoided if these potential problems are anticipated in the trial protocol.	1.0417232160349188
A prospective approach that anticipates problems at the time the study protocol is drafted is preferable to a reluctant reactive approach during the course of the trial.	1.0652781064892767
Ultrasound is the primary imaging modality after kidney transplantation.	0.747121443843396
Its general availability and the absence of radiation exposure and discomfort for the patient also make it a suitable procedure for follow-up.	1.0681095537056458
Simple B-mode sonography provides comprehensive information on the morphology of the renal transplant and surrounding structures, while color-coded duplex sonography (CCDS) additionally allows assessment of the anastomoses and organ perfusion.	0.9846612446168688
More recent technical advances such as power Doppler ultrasound appear to improve in particular the assessment of peripheral circulation.	0.923161265996282
The possibilities and limitations of the various sonographic techniques in the evaluation of kidney transplants are discussed with special reference to the most important clinical aspects and some basic technical concepts.	1.1633646679417584
Purpose: The first morphological changes in eyes with HIV infection are microvascular disease of the retina with cotton-wool spots and microaneurysms.	1.0363525867700458
The study was performed to find out if evidence of disturbances of ocular microcirculation can be established by non-invasive methods.	1.1486330801171207
The operative realignment of mechanical axis deviations (MAD) is necessary to prevent early joint degeneration and to reach normal load-bearing.	1.0176060069268769
Modern types of external fixation systems allow an alignment of the mechanical axis to exact degrees.	0.8956874717154322
Predominantly this are corrections of angular deformities.	0.6707413873288222
In some cases the analysis of the MAD does not show any angular deformity, but a parallel staggering of the mechanical axis lines of a bone.	1.0936227163016115
Such parallel staggering of the mechanical axis lines is defined as a translation deformity of the bone.	0.8988509903394414
In combined deformities with angulation and translation the centre of deformity can be established proximal or distal out of the limit of the bone.	0.9988150375467992
In translation deformities the realignment of the mechanical axis requires a parallel re-staggering made by a translation-osteotomy or by a counterangulated double osteotomy.	0.9022466814466464
In complex deformities with angulation and translation, the translation requires a separate corrective planning.	0.8779490191036841
By using external fixator systems to perform acute or progressive corrective osteotomies the position of the Axis of Correction of Angulation (ACA) in relation to the n-CORA of the deformity has to be considered.	1.0933502648104527
If ACA position is not conform with the n-CORA position relevant geometric effects in relation of length and translation occur.	0.896014827870247
These geometric effects to corrective osteotomies can be calculated by using simple trigonometric formulas or graphical methods.	0.7942615444429265
Possibilities to compensate translation and length effects are shown by using unilateral external fixator systems.	0.9262352304851479
The employers' liability insurance association for victuallers and licensed victuallers has been controlling healing procedures with the aid of a computer program for several years.	0.8481216721177811
The personal data of the injured patient and the precise diagnosis of the injury are used to prepare a forecast of the duration of the treatment and of the patient's inability to work.	1.367506870126141
The basis of this forecast is provided by tables integrated in the program, which have been elaborated by experts on trauma medicine and also constantly refined by them.	1.106539906575198
Meanwhile numerous insurance companies concerned with accidents and trauma have acquired the program and are intending to use it.	0.8302347800731974
The objective is a national database on trauma medicine covering the whole of Germany.	0.7874823498382084
It is intended that its evaluation will help to guarantee the quality of concomitant treatment of trauma victims and also yield some indications on how best to realize the networking of institutions concerned with acute treatment and rehabilitation.	0.9601435624716991
Stroke and its consequences are under medical, sociologic and socioeconomic aspects one of the biggest contemporary challenges.	0.9509920201322979
Due to the demographic development the importance of this disease will further increase.	1.0460231398202182
Nonetheless acute therapy of ischemic stroke up to now was marked by therapeutic nihilism and adherence to empiric therapeutic procedures.	0.908075503416041
Only the admission of rt-Pa in the USA in 1996 for the systemic thrombolysis in ischemic insults less then 3 hours old led to a change in therapeutic strategies.	1.0225298145864528
The good profit-risk-ratio of early thrombolysis with rt-Pa could be confirmed by further studies lately.	0.9382582688274277
In the meantime this therapy was officially recommended by the AHA in the importance of grade A recommendation.	0.8885550623728495
In Europe thrombolysis is equally promoted as the procedure of choice.	0.8522439230329132
At present only few patients receive such a treatment.	0.843212848562972
A thrombolytic therapy can only be provided by a minority of centers due to high requirement in infra-structure.	0.8389679954798532
Furthermore clinic admission often appears with immense loss of time.	0.6569436273745136
Unfortunately also within the clinics there are relevant latencies until therapeutic intervention.	0.8152808115248911
Therefore fundamental requirements for thrombolytic therapy are the indentification of potentially suitable patients and the rapid transfer to an appropriate clinic.	0.9928512015528258
A 69-year-old patient with reduced pulmonary function was diagnosed as suffering from non-small cell lung cancer of the left lung invading the main bronchus, pulmonary artery and left atrium.	1.2174300954393382
Using cardiopulmonary bypass, an extended pneumonectomy with partial resection of the left atrium was performed.	1.1221884268161249
The cardiac defect was closed with a pericardial patch.	0.7197340226932099
The lower lobe was divided ex situ from the upper lobe and reimplanted with anastomosis of the lower pulmonary vein to the left auricle.	1.067571246525636
After a totally uneventful course the patient is in good condition and free of tumor recurrence 2.5 years postoperatively.	1.2508517156100138
In this retrospective study we report the indications, complications and functional and cosmetic results after dermofat grafting into anophthalmic orbits.	1.2031264996906408
The method consists of implantation of autogenous dermis with attached subcutaneous fat from the gluteal region into the orbit.	0.7762309821056168
Twenty-four primary and 4 secondary grafts were implanted in 28 patients aged 12 to 49 years.	0.974817415400053
In the explantation site one patient showed delayed healing.	0.7100834339512234
All implants became integrated, none were lost because of infection or extrusion.	0.9328170214462347
Eleven patients developed minor complications like central ulceration in the dermis, hair growth on the dermis or suture granuloma.	0.8920589283799263
In the primary implant group the functional and cosmetic outcome was evaluated by measurements of the lid structures, exophthalmometry (Hertel) and measuring the prosthesis motility (Kestenbaum).	1.0112241258948553
Three patients showed fair results; all the others had good or very good results.	1.067594626171277
In one case of a secondary implant marked graft atrophy was observed.	1.0372613694007875
Despite the more extensive surgery and some minor complications the safety of this method with good functional and cosmetic results makes dermofat grafting an excellent alternative to heterogenous orbital implants.	1.0413449030261406
Liver tissue from 14 female patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC; stages I-IV) was systematically investigated for the prevalence and distribution of dendritic antigen-presenting cells.	1.0352964136620786
Dendritic cells (DCs) were immunhistochemically identified by use of anti-S 100 protein and KiMlp antibodies.	0.9167328157709491
We confirm previous findings that, in early PBC, S 100 protein-positive DCs can be detected within the lining of bile duct epithelia.	1.152991213811143
However, the present study disclosed that S 100 protein- and KiMlp-positive DCs regularly occur in piecemeal necroses (PMNs) developing in PBC-associated chronic hepatitis.	1.1198929924098981
DCs in PMNs were observed in all PBC stages, but were most prominent in late-stage PBC.	1.1671430384930568
These findings suggest that autoimmune tissue damage in PBC may not be limited to bile ducts, but may also ensue in hepatic parenchyma, producing the pattern of chronic hepatitis with signs of activity.	0.9352532647548768
Health care in emergencies is a social good and a hallmark of a humane society, the ethical foundations of which have to form the basis of all decisions regarding medical emergencies.	1.0762977342997901
The ethics of emergency medical care are part of general medical ethics.	0.9445325552327046
Their principles are outlined and put into perspective with regard to dilemmas characteristic of emergency care.	0.8308647556096407
Due to dwindling resources, the efficiency of emergency medical care is being increasingly scrutinized.	0.9664317105464668
Possibilities of rationalizing care without compromising its quality are being discussed, such as renouncing futile therapy and implementing measures of prevention.	0.9332394028002103
If emergency medical services are to accomplish their mission, however, observing standards of medical practice, legal provisions, and the given framework of society, they must not surrender to pure cost containment.	1.2094472195203185
We performed a phase II trial with second-line chemotherapy in patients with refractory, metastatic cancer of the bladder.	0.9292657147217748
Second-line therapy consists of 2.6 cycles of mitomycin-C, 5-fluorouracil and folic acid.	0.9632847754437709
Two patients suffered from WHO grade III side effects (nephrotoxicity, leukocytopenia).	0.7911803409132594
We did not find any complete or partial remission.	0.711699738837901
Four patients had a stable disease; 3.3 months after therapy, patients developed tumor progression with a median survival of 9 months.	1.3293395674122561
Four patients reported an improvement in quality of life.	0.7087725847731481
Since all patients received supportive care, improvement in quality of life cannot be related to chemotherapy alone.	1.0387116613334098
In conclusion, second-line chemotherapy with mitomycin-C, 5-fluorouracil and folic acid has no effect on refractory, metastatic cancer of the bladder and is no alternative for cisplatin and methotrexate-based chemotherapy.	0.9428396587906197
Every form of active euthanasia is a punishable offence under § 216 of the Penal Code; nor is there any ethical justification for it from a medical point of view.	0.8564556894250851
The many strands of the movement in favour of making "death on demand" exempt from punishment in Germany as it is in The Netherlands cannot change this.	0.982606653457612
The oral retinoid etretinate (Tigason) has recently been replaced by trans-acitretin (Neotigason) in the treatment of severe psoriasis, primarily because of its short half-life and the assumption that a shorter period of subsequent contraception would be required.	1.1484383223124985
After introduction of the new drug, however, circulating quantities of etretinate were detected in patients treated with trans-acitretin.	1.1120109047398055
Thus far, re-esterification has been detected in at least 83 cases.	1.0342763914766244
The 2-month period of strict contraception initially recommended after oral intake of trans-acitretin has been extended to 2 years, as with etretinate.	1.0925974965251568
We review some aspects of trans-acitretin metabolism, with special emphasis on etretinate formation.	0.9248120337319568
Re-esterification of trans-acitretin into etretinate takes place under varying conditions in volunteers and patients, as well as in animal models.	0.8963020558742073
Ethanol is a co-factor for the enzymatic re-esterification of trans-acitretin.	0.7036088489401724
It is unclear whether the introduction of trans-acitretin has been of any significant benefit to patients.	0.9431481658458026
Monitoring of plasma retinoid levels during and after retinoid therapy remains of decisive importance in managing difficult cases and or in approving decisions for pregnancy.	0.858176305073854
The purpose of this study was to compare the midterm results of the conservative treatment of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures in athletes.	0.8946386852584965
During 1989 and 1990, 279 athletes with ACL ruptures were treated in our Sports Surgery Department, and 221 of them were suitable for inclusion in the study.	1.0154343864909166
The patients were divided into two groups based on management after the diagnosis of ACL rupture had been  made.	0.9464485835980527
Group I (n = 129) underwent ACL reconstruction using free bone-patellar tendon-bone autografts, while group II (n = 92) received conservative treatment.	1.2695176395496208
We were able to evaluate 92 patients during follow-up (42 from group I and 50 from group II).	1.0720279189609851
The average follow-up period was 86 months.	1.100950410261544
There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding the patients' age, sex, or level of sports activity.	1.130968619637146
Follow-up consisted of clinical and radiological examinations and recording of the subjective opinions of the patients.	1.1422235554882956
During follow-up, we used IKDC and OAK scores to evaluate the results.	1.17717485152846
We found significantly better results in the group that was operated on if the patients took part in high-risk pivoting sports, but there was no difference if the patients were in the low-risk or no-risk pivoting group of athletes.	1.3615107663846924
Concerning reoperation and early arthrosis, the difference was significant between the two groups.	1.077769075794317
Background: By depletion of stratospheric ozone, enhanced levels of UV radiation reach the surface of the earth.	1.0397015637200817
Exposure of the anterior parts of the eye to UV radiation leads to irritation of the conjunctival and corneal cells.	1.0158352053487452
The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of a low field strength MRI unit (0.2 T; Esaote, Biomedica) and a high field strength MRI unit (1.5 T; Siemens) in detecting meniscal lesions.	1.1586980022494584
Twenty patients were investigated on a 0.2-T low-field MRI unit and a 1.5-T high-field MRI unit for meniscal lesions.	1.2394464239330754
Evaluation was performed of four meniscal compartments (anterior and posterior medial and lateral meniscus), for a total of 80 observations.	1.277208742639992
The reliability of diagnosis was ranked qualitatively on a three-point scale.	0.9895893805251542
Investigations of the high-field MRI unit revealed a meniscal tear in 6 patients and ruled out a tear in 14 patients.	0.9492151162538661
Evaluation of individual meniscal compartments revealed diagnosis with high confidence in 58 observations and with moderate confidence in 22 observations.	0.6947415653404381
Investigations of the low-field MRI unit revealed a meniscal tear in 5 patients and ruled out tears in 15 patients.	0.8960549637598022
Evaluation of individual meniscal compartments revealed diagnosis with high confidence in 39 observations, with moderate confidence in 38 observations, and with low confidence in 3 observations.	1.0231868224907528
The diagnosis in high- and low-field images was identical in 98.7 % of cases; in one patient observations from the high-field unit changed the therapeutic management.	1.3605358488197452
Diagnostic reliability was significantly higher with highfield strength MR imaging.	0.8024793033615527
Low field strength MR imaging shows comparatively high diagnostic accuracy for meniscal lesions compared to high field strength imaging; however, we demonstrated a significantly higher confidence in diagnosis with high-field MR imaging.	1.208654344328066
The past decade has seen the successful application of genetic techniques in the dissection of the most important phenotypes of cancer cells.	1.0145303952566425
In the case of drug resistance mechanisms, the elucidation of the genes involved in resistance to anticancer agents has led to new and unexpected information about tumor physiology and may well open therapeutic options by virtue of reversing clinical chemoresistance.	0.9985552865581565
The experimental characterization of defined multidrug resistance factors, such as P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance associated protein, topoisomerase, or glutathione-S-transferase in urologic malignancies, is now relatively comprehensive, allowing for an initial analysis.	1.0317315897359376
Clinical studies on some of these concepts have been started and will be the subject of careful scrutinity.	1.0797690807775624
We expect that they will have a considerable impact on the way certain urologic anticancer strategies will be pursued in the future.	0.8631100263872078
A study was carried out to determine the risk of dysesthesia of the inferior alveolar and of the lingual nerve after molar surgery.	1.0653726164650168
A total of 1103 impacted lower wisdom teeth and 3 impacted lower second molars were removed in 687 patients, all of whom with unaltered sensibility preoperatively.	0.9120240548410891
Clinical, radiological, and surgical factors of each case were recorded.	1.0526909726465956
Postoperative disturbances in the sensibility of the lip and tongue were evaluated by neurological examination.	0.9554210073136841
Follow-up was carried out for a maximum of 35 weeks.	1.0528736997992414
Dysesthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve occurred with an incidence of 3.57%.	0.8520304900939161
The lingual nerve was injured in 2.1% of patients.	0.9750939127122399
Most of the initially reported alterations in sensation resolved within the follow-up period.	0.8921598226652666
Dysesthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve persisted in 0.91%, and of the lingual nerve in 0.37%.	0.9622347542570348
However, the extent of the prolonged impairment was slight in general.	1.0531271844193855
The effect of the documented factors on the incidence of dysesthesia was analyzed.	0.8401324480715466
For the inferior alveolar nerve, analysis revealed significant effects in older patients, for completely developed roots, for deeply impacted teeth, in the radiological relationship of the roots and the inferior alveolar canal, for difficult surgery, and for intraoperative exposure of the nerve.	1.352185793950803
The surgeon and the anesthesia had a significant influence on lingual dysesthesia.	0.8469103434771864
Background: This review of radiological and other procedures used in the diagnosis of (chronic) low-back pain is not intended to provide a complete evaluation of the methods employed, because the validity, specificity and sensitivity of the various diagnostic measures are the subject of so much controversy that a comprehensive discussion would be beyond the scope of the present overview.	1.40026362528004
The choice of method depends not only on the clinical symptoms but also on the localisation of the pain, the aetiology of which may also be related to the age of the patient.	1.1403038693476941
Enteritis and pseudoappendicitis are typical manifestations of Yersinia infections in children.	0.7180637711078823
This is a report on a child with localised tumourous mesenteric lymphadenitis due to Yersinia enterocolitica persistent for a long time.	0.962590020902389
We found specific antibodies against Yersinia outer membrane proteins repeat-edly in the patients' serum.	1.0163306730267097
Only after a ciprofloxacin therapy for 16 weeks we observed a recovery of our patient.	0.9123993697916934
The present study investigates patients' expectations toward radiotherapy and their associations to quality of life and physician judgements.	1.1646250954296922
Fifty-five patients with tumors of different sites (30 with previous tumor-related surgery, 25 without surgery) admitted to the department of radiotherapy filled out a standardized questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30, PLC by Siegrist et al., therapy-related expectations and success) before and after inpatient radiotherapy.	1.158836971908512
The corresponding physician ratings were collected.	0.5435935642510736
Fifty-eight percent of the patients expected the therapeutic goal "healing", whereas from the physician's standpoint this was realistic in only 7 % of cases.	1.1940604613246544
The specific radiotherapy-related expectations "tumor control" and "pain relief" reached almost the same levels in patients and physician (71 % vs 71 % and 40 % vs 44 %).	1.3604369801928027
Patients with healing expectancy reported higher quality of life at the beginning of the therapy (53.4 % vs 39.9 %); patients expecting pain relief reported lower quality of life (37.1 % vs 54.5 %).	1.2352304488458745
Surgical patients who had been operated on within the past year (n = 18) showed a particularly high healing expectancy (83 %), whereas patients whose operation dated back more than 1 year focused on pain relief as therapeutic goal (83 %).	1.096338276857316
The surgeon, as the primary contact person for patients, can influence patients' therapy-related expectations.	1.233099450723881
In explaining the overall therapeutic strategy, surgeons should also mention the scope and limits of adjuvant therapies.	0.8862718648424588
The meanings of the terms "quality", "quality of care", and "quality management" were clarified with common international definitions.	1.4059503701246854
Based on that, the basic ideas, concepts, and objectives of quality management in medicine were explained.	1.1564150038683203
Finally some future trends related to quality were viewed, which represent challenges for the medical profession and entire medicine.	1.101299635220535
The papular-purpuric "gloves and socks" syndrome (PPGSS) was first described in 1990 by Harms et al.	0.6970664367365821
The syndrome is characterised by fever, an itchy erythema with edema, confluent papules and purpura of the hands and feet in a "gloves and socks" distribution.	0.8316063926060479
The skin lesions may be associated with purpura and superficial erosions of the oral mucosa.	1.0280421076421775
Viral infections, in particular parvovirus B19, are the most likely trigger.	1.3221141950388606
In the present case PPGSS developed after taking trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.	0.9743955958533425
Since the patient developed identical symptoms after accidental re-challenge with the same drug, this case strongly suggests medications as another factor in the pathogenesis of PPGSS.	1.1181142690220454
Most fractures of the clavicle heal well with nonoperative treatment.	0.9738325504188695
On rare occasions, malunited clavicular fractures are associated with a pattern of disability that includes not only pain but also functional or neurovascular impairment.	0.906377513897899
In these cases, clavicular osteotomy and correction of the deformity should be considered.	0.8375492478844946
In four patients with a malunited fracture of the clavicle following nonoperative treatment, we performed a clavicular osteotomy for deformity.	1.1452568580391866
In all four patients the clavicular fracture healed with shortening associated with pain and ipsilateral glenohumeral dysfunction.	0.9642645200201392
The deformity was not associated with neurovascular dysfunction.	0.7319823781701478
In preoperative X-ray studies, the shortening of the malunited clavicle was between 0.9 and 2.2 cm in comparison to the contralateral clavicle.	1.401435962292794
All patients underwent an extension osteotomy of the clavicle with interposition of an autogenous iliac crest bone graft.	0.9531338431612577
The follow-up was 1 - 4 years postoperatively.	1.3060990191447521
The functional outcome was evaluated using the Constant-Murley and the UCLA score.	0.9673456844538418
All patients had immediate pain relief following osteotomy and correction of the deformity.	0.9216564508790921
The shoulder function rapidly improved, and the functional outcome was good in three out of the four patients.	1.233601073446843
If there is associated functional impairment in malunited clavicular fractures, extension osteotomy combined with autogenous bone grafting may produce predictably good results.	0.9295709835607648
As the importance of laparoscopic surgery for benign diseases of the gastrointestinal tract continues to grow, the application of this approach in cases of malignancy remains controversial.	1.039757362702368
Although the concept of cancer recurrence in the area of surgical wounds is not new, the incidence of port site recurrence is the most obvious concern.	1.2065677514558024
Indications and contraindications for surgery as well as a standardized nomenclature describing the type of laparoscopic procedures being performed are some other issues that need to be clarified.	1.0133938558487585
Complete laparoscopic procedures or the combination of laparoscopy with open techniques can offer advantages and disadvantages that surgeons will have to take into consideration when making decisions.	1.038786663202346
The skill of the operating team and the extent of disease define the boundaries of laparoscopic surgery possible.	0.9831210838424468
The continued research as well as development of intelligent instruments and standardized techniques might give laparoscopy a clear role in the treatment of abdominal malignancies.	0.977617793602705
Background: The mechanical stabilization of the cornea in keratoconus may delay progression of this disease.	1.1027618987324062
The cross-linking techniques optimized in corneas of enucleated porcine eyes were investigated under in vivo conditions in rabbits to estimate the biocompatibility and duration of the stiffening effect.	0.9546308667414645
In the biopsy material of a polypoid intrabronchial lesion of a 54-year-old male patient with radiologically established lung tumor, spindle-cell neoplasia was seen.	0.9212214435406548
No clear histogenetic classification of the submucous tumor process was possible.	0.8619498715667508
After resection of the right upper lobe of the lung, including the results of additional immunohistochemical analyses, the tumor was classified as biphasic synovial sarcoma.	1.1800247982266032
This was suggested mostly by immunohistochemical detection of the epithelial membrane antigene (EMA) and of vimentin.	1.1342392881556438
Extensive clinical examinations ruled out the possibility of a primary tumor with extrapulmonary localization.	1.0575796223730654
This case report shows the problems faced in correctly classifying the histogenesis or the direction of differentiation in extremely rare cases of primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma.	1.0840976768003725
Especially in small biopsy samples showing a submucous spindle-cell tumor of the lung, apart from frequent sarcoma metastases, the presence of primary synovial sarcoma of the lung has to be considered in the differential diagnosis.	1.025562117458114
Necrotizing pancreatitis is still associated with considerable morbidity and mortality.	0.8503495721695647
Formerly, surgical treatment with early and extensive pancreatic resection has been the standard.	1.2684851643598538
Improvements in our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease and progress in the field of intensive care therapy have made conservative therapy the initial standard in the treatment of necrotizing pancreatitis.	1.1466267499404772
A considerable percentage of patients with sterile necrosis can be managed with low morbidity and mortality by conservative treatment without operation.	1.1267732006097142
Nevertheless, surgical treatment is indicated in patients with infected necrosis and in sterile necrosis if multiorgan failure persists over a limited period of time despite maximum intensive care therapy.	1.2302739800663647
Pancreatic resection should be abandoned for surgical treatment of pancreatic necrosis, as results with regard to morbidity, mortality and long-term outcome are unsatisfactory.	1.195251574860306
Today the surgical standard is careful digital necrosectomy, which must be followed by either postoperatve drainage, repeated open lavage or continuous closed lavage.	0.9714510526369106
In experienced hands, all three procedures provide similar results with regard to morbidity and mortality.	1.0107179636766008
The aim of quality management in rheumatology is to improve care and outcome in patients with rheumatic diseases.	1.2807593381870863
This can be achieved by means of prospective long-term observation of the patient with regular documentation of clinical, radiological, biochemical and functional data using certain validated scoring methods (DAS, radiological score, ADL score Hanover or Health assessment questionnaire, SF36, etc.).	1.0331991039423984
Long-term observation and documentation including radiographs have been performed in the rheumatology hospital in Ratingen for 20 years without even knowing the term quality management.	0.9998788394255199
Quality management in a hospital for rheumatic diseases begins with certain structural prerequisites: possibility of direct admission of a patient to the hospital by the family physician, outpatient clinic to investigate and to follow patients over a long period of time, multidisciplinary team with specialists in rheumatology, orthopedic surgery, physiotherapy, ergotherapy, special care, psychological, and social services, close cooperation with specialists in neurology, dermatology, ophthalmology, etc., department of radiology, special laboratory, facilities for internal diagnostics and treatment.	1.1590333537137334
The hospital needs a training program for the qualification of rheumatologists and orthopaedic surgeons.	0.7219607383064189
The hospital staff should closely cooperate with the doctors in private practice who admit patients and should continously support patient organizations.	0.8761676043544675
The quality of outcome is influenced by the process quality which depends on the following factors: selection, training and motivation of the hospital staff; supervision of clinical assessment and documentation by senior physicians, daily x-ray demonstrations and case reports, interdisciplinary case demonstrations at least every week in addition to daily consultation, team reports, regular education including review of actual literature for physicians, education programs exchanging knowledge with physiotherapists and nurses, and regular education programs for patients.	1.0946423245247083
Process quality can only be achieved by an interdisciplinary approach and regular communication between all participants including the patient, whose opinion must be noted and regarded.	1.0129739668220805
As far as possible, the same doctor who treats the patient in the hospital should follow her/him in the outpatient clinic.	1.1609593974348624
The quality of outcome can be improved by regular reinvestigation of the patient with control of medication, side effects, efficacy, documentation of clinical, biochemical, radiological, and functional data.	1.1099738623408513
Decisions for further treatment have to be based on these follow-up data.	1.1519050388413714
A standardized follow up and documentation system for all rheumatology units with prompt feedback could definitely improve the quality of rheumatologic care in Germany.	0.8470121358558552
Two children on chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) had initially focal, then generalized seizures of short duration.	1.069042989028748
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed in one case minor parietal, cortical and subcortical increased signal on T2-weighted images.	0.9178303487386489
In a second case extended supratentorial lesions and additional signal changes in the cerebellum were found.	1.0005124318720833
Although chemotherapy was continued, a few days later signal changes were considerably reduced or had disappeared.	1.120783113764288
We consider these lesions to be seizure induced in a brain previously sensitized by chemotherapy.	0.8348874139395269
Hydatid disease is caused by the parasitic tapeworm Echinococcus.	0.6800248286345905
The larval stage of this parasite can thrive in many parts of the body, most frequently in the liver.	1.0229273458589578
Primary bone location is very rare, accounting for less than 2 % of all hydatid lesions.	1.1691694236350796
We report on a case of left-sided extended pelvic infestation.	1.043635500064545
The destruction of the hip joint, os pubis, large parts of the ileum and the femoral head made pelvic resection and prosthetic replacement necessary.	0.991322373644846
Recurrence of a hydatid cyst 5 years later in the left groin originating from the proximal femur was treated with second femoral resection and new total hip replacement.	1.068898314469712
Because of instability, the primarily inserted polyacetal pelvic replacement had to be exchanged for a custom-made device fabricated with the aid of computer-aided design (CAD) techniques.	0.9384689582484388
This surgical procedure was combined with chemotherapy (mebendazole).	0.8003833683301672
The necessity of radical resection in osseus hydatid disease is discussed.	0.8337888231343538
At present, phosphodiesterase III inhibitors are commonly used for the treatment of low cardiac output states.	0.9817196092641844
Despite their positive inotropic and lusitropic effects, these drugs are still under discussion because of certain adverse effects like thrombopaenia, elevation of transaminases, abdominal disregulation, and excessive periphereal vasodilatation.	1.0947972442170155
As a consequence, more cardioselective phosphodiesterase inhibitors were developed with the aim of reducing these adverse effects.	1.1741627424992755
One of them, enoximone (Marion Merrell Dow, Fig.	0.7536310539365553
1), an imidazole derivative, has nearly no influence on platelets and abdominal organ function.	1.2215772063683152
In addition, in many studies vasodilatation was found to be absent.	1.2573036142504204
Recently a new substance, R80122 (Janssen, Belgium, Fig.	0.7936980635281013
1), was developed.	1.4396794866348437
First experimental studies showed high cardioselectivity of this substance.	0.833490216424328
The aim of this study was to compare the haemodynamic effects of enoximone and R80122 in patients with ischaemic heart disease.	0.8275262549760661
The extremely rare finding of a proximal radio-ulnar synostosis in a 5 years-old girl with a fetal alcohol syndrome is presented.	0.9601907989432396
Despite the elbow's being fixed at 30  ° pronation, the patient exhibits good ipsilateral arm function.	1.10618039499751
The difficulties in differential diagnosis and treatment modalities are discussed.	1.1495786242764348
Ischemic preconditioning (IP), using one or more brief periods of ischemia before a sustained ische- mia, represents a new approach in reducing ischemia-induced skeletal muscle damage.	1.110842783949849
The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of IP on skeletal muscle function after 3 h ischemia and 2 h reperfusion in a rodent model.	0.9200556746117573
IP protocols using one, two, or three preconditioning cycles of 10 min ischemia and 10 min reperfusion each, were compared to non-preconditioned controls.	1.1581999876483944
IP was found to significantly improve force, performance, endurance, and contractility of postischemic skeletal muscle.	1.0200530032419812
The efficacy of IP- induced protection was correlated with the number of preconditioning cycles.	0.8331885134232353
Preconditioning with three cycles resulted in a more effective protection as compared to one or two cycles.	1.1031106951310248
Altogether, this study describes the efficacy of IP in improving post-ischemic muscle function and the need of more than one IP cycle to achieve this improvement.	1.2327275073202266
The respective clinical potential warrants further exploration.	0.5738950399180703
Pachyonychia congenita (PC) is a rare ectodermal dysplasia with variable expression.	0.8803074803093837
The condition is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.	0.9124462742390974
Several classifications of PC have been proposed.	0.7704542795274567
Feinstein and colleagues suggested four clinical types of PC.	0.6377310346519939
Type II, the Jackson-Lawler-Syndrome, is characterized by multiple epidermal cysts, palmoplantar bullae and hyperhidrosis as well as natal teeth in addition to the main findings of pachyonychia, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and follicular keratosis.	1.0119972061996867
We report two patients (father and son) with Jackson-Lawler-Syndrome and describe in detail pathogenesis, diagnostic criteria and treatment approaches as well as the different classifications of pachyonychia congenita.	1.2380549148050697
Aim of this review article was to critically analyse the recently described zytogenetic and molecular markers for testicular germ cell tumors with regard to their clinical utility.	1.1950544917900356
The isochromosome i(12p) represents the most common and characteristic cytogenetic finding which already appears in testicular carcinoma in situ.	0.9422481674213327
A number of proto - oncogenes (Cyclin D and PTHLH) as well as putative tumor suppressor genes are localized on 12p; however, their role in pathogenesis and prognosis of testicular germ cell tumors has not been defined yet.	1.0310627782702537
Clinical characteristics of patients with familial testicular germ cell tumors indicate a genetic background for the development of testicular tumors.	0.9113346984134081
Although a number of chromsomal loci encoding potential testicular tumor susceptibility genes have been identified, the genetic basis of testicular cancer pathogenesis is still unknown.	0.9520051774523635
With regard to molecular prognostic risk factors most of the reported data on proliferation markers, tumor suppressor genes, proteases and adhesion molecules have to be confirmed in prospective randomized trials prior to their widespread clinical use.	1.0645053128262834
Based on the available data on prospective studies percentage of embryonal carcinoma and vascular invasion appear to be the most significant prognosticators.	1.1857282725231342
Investigation and identification of those factors determining the aggressive biologic behavior of embryonal carcinoma compared to all other histological components appear to be most promising in research for prognosticators of metastatic disease.	0.9006649948632975
After laparoscopic cholecystectomy, carbon dioxide (CO2) must be exhaled after resorption from the abdominal cavity.	0.8006315892146152
There is controversy about the amount and relevance of postoperative CO2 resorption.	0.8794493548906968
Without continuous postoperative monitoring, after laparoscopic cholecystectomy a certain risk may consist in unnoticed hypercapnia due to CO2 resorption.	0.9236068572793688
Studies exist on the course of end-expiratory CO2 (PeCO2) alone over a longer postoperative period of time in extubated patients during spontaneous breathing.	1.0816004128328254
The goal of this prospective study was to investigate the amount of CO2 resorbed from the abdominal cavity in the postoperative period by means of CO2 metabolism.	0.9903485238010811
After giving informed consent to the study, which was approved by the local ethics committee, 20 patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy.	1.2740805878984205
All patients received general endotracheal anaesthesia.	0.8081043454372804
After induction, total IV anaesthesia was maintained using fentanyl, propofol, and atracurium.	1.0636123438779364
Patients were ventilated with oxygen in air (FiO2 0.4).	1.0105436007430086
The intraabdominal pressure during the surgical procedure ranged from 12 to 14 mm Hg.	0.940404975507117
Thirty minutes after releasing the capnoperitoneum (KP), CO2 elimination (V.CO2), oxygen uptake (V.O2), and respiratory quotient (RQ) were measured every minute for 1 h by indirect calorimetry using the metabolic monitor Deltatrac according to the principle of Canopy.	1.1964672963222542
Assuming an unchanged metabolism, the CO2 resorption (V.CO2) at any given time (t) can be calculated from V.CO2 (t)=V.CO2 (t)-RQ (preop) V.O2 (t).	1.295497747993058
It was thus necessary to define the patient's metabolism on the day of operation.	1.0834846247407823
The first data were collected before surgery and after introduction of the arterial and venous cannulae for a 15-min period.	1.0612793622207823
Measuring point 0 was determined after exsufflation of the KP and emptying of the remaining CO2 via manual compression by the surgeon at the end of surgery.	1.0468620294944653
Patient's tracheas were extubated and metabolic monitoring started 30 min after release of the KP for 60 min.	0.8710841493615847
Simultaneously, a nasal side-stream capnometry probe was placed and the PeCO2 and respiratory frequency (RF) were obtained by the Capnomac Ultima (Datex) and registered every minute as well.	1.1170113609331715
Values were averaged over four periods of 15 min each.	0.750300663686276
An arterial blood gas sample was drawn at the end of every 15-min period.	0.9179644738771617
Postoperative pain was scored by a visual analog scale and completed by a subjective index questionnaire on general well-being.	0.9254564058185785
All data were analysed by the Friedman or Wilcoxon test; P<0.05 was considered significant.	0.7359982167698309
The findings do not indicate CO2 resorption in the postoperative period after laparoscopic cholecystectomy (Tables 2 and 3, Fig.	1.0371527683288913
Arterial CO2 as well as PeCO2 were elevated postoperatively (45 mm Hg vs. 36 mm Hg intraoperatively), while V.CO2 and V.O2 were unchanged when compared to the preoperative measuring period.	1.211608961414111
The postoperative RF was comparable to preoperative values.	0.7557763926939279
Calculated CO2 was lower than 10 ml/min and within accuracy of measurements.	1.130193721095229
The postoperative pain index ranged between 3 and 4, and 3.75 - 15 mg piritramid was administered.	1.2726149484204374
All patients feld tired immediately after the operation, but scores improved slightly at the end of the 60-min period of metabolic monitoring.	1.0031900201232364
There is no significant resorption of CO2 from the abdominal cavity later than 30 min after releasing the KP.	1.0091673848386535
Up to this time, any CO2 remaining in the abdominal cavity after careful emptying by the surgeon has been resorbed and exhaled.	1.026435205720668
The gene of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4)-inhibitor p16INK4A (CDKN2/MTS1) has been proposed as a candidate for a tumor-suppressor gene located on chromosome 9p21, a frequently deleted region in a series of human cancers including malignant melanoma.	1.0901941886946733
An increasing and sometimes conflicting body of data has accumulated regarding the frequency of homozygous deletions and mutations as well as the importance of p16INK4A in malignant melanoma.	1.0017433892805572
The purpose of this review is therefore to summarize the current knowledge on p16INK4A and to discuss its biologic significance in the pathogenesis of melanocytic tumors.	1.1030621928388573
The prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and disorders in HIV-infected patients is high.	0.9797451355027401
The differential diagnosis includes psychoreactive disorders, acute psychiatric symptoms of an HIV-associated encephalopathy, and symptomatic psychotic illnesses due to secondary neurologic manifestations such as opportunistic central nervous infections and intracerebral lymphoma.	1.1085480584376064
Clinical aspects and psychopathological findings are not sufficient for differential diagnosis and identification of primarily psychiatric disorders.	1.0658355240527753
Secondary neurologic manifestations causing a symptomatic psychosis must be excluded as soon as possible by brain imaging (CT, MRI) and analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid.	1.1862832358261324
In emergency situations, however, German law imposes strict regulations, especially in the case of sectioned patients.	1.0670758541902767
These medical and medicolegal questions are illustrated by case reports and propositions for an effective strategy are made.	0.9017171875827564
In simultaneous bilateral nerve recordings, patients with Sympathetically Maintained Pain (SMP) affecting one limb show similar sympathetic traffic in nerves supplying the affected and unaffected limb, also when the painful limb shows a marked regional autonomic (vasomotor) dysfunction.	0.8988978710799937
These findings argue against the notion that SMP must be mediated by a reflex change in the pattern of sympathetic discharge.	0.8539525829511979
In general, they underline the fact that autonomic effector disturbances may give little information about underlying nerve traffic.	0.9307598074731807
Intraoperative transluminal angioplasty (ITA) has considerably broadened the spectrum of vascular surgical reconstruction, fulfils the requirements of minimally invasive therapy and has thus experienced a rapid development within the past few years.	1.0509416142294437
Whereas the indications and clinical results have been described adequately in the literature, reports on the procedural management of ITA are rare.	1.153504816946696
One of the basic prerequisites of this method is the correct and nontraumatic implantation of the vascular access sheath at the proper location.	1.288074666260169
In the following, the technique of ortho- and retrograde sheath implantation, either through the vessel itself or through a vascular graft, is described in detail.	1.2155612044191368
By respecting particular standards for sheath introduction, ischaemia time and vessel wall injury during ITA can be kept to a minimum.	0.8227464119318931
The importance of the chronology of vascular reconstruction to angioplasty is also elucidated.	0.9281063204835649
In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of sheath implantation compared with direct vessel puncture are demonstrated.	0.9669733616121854
In spite of new developments, including intraluminal fixation of the sheath with an expandable balloon, the "ideal" angioplasty access sheath is, as yet, not available.	1.175767884347301
In several cases of lupus erythematosus (SLE, SCLE, DLE), the Koebner phenomenon could be seen in the apparently normal skin of patients following traumas, scratching effects, operation scars, contact dermatitis, pressure from sock tops, application of liquid nitrogen, exposure to strong sun light, etc.	0.9827608288342993
The interval between exposure to such provocation factors and appearance of the isomorphic reactions varied from case to case.	0.8871320711724782
In SLE patients receiving systemic treatment with glucocorticosteroids, the Koebner phenomenon could not be found, while it was detected in patients with generalized DLE who had never received any systemic glucocorticoid hormones.	1.1222858966712939
It was not seen in patients with localized DLE.	0.9129739744146368
There was no direct relationship between the appearance of humoral autoantibodies and onset of the Koebner phenomenon.	0.9864280318309187
With regard to the histopathogenesis of the Koebner phenomenon, it is thought that disturbances of the local cellular repair processes and of the cytokine network, with expression of adhesion molecules, might be involved.	1.136419973549625
The Koebner phenomenon may be a valuable model for the investigation of lupus erythematosus.	0.9421849583749677
In 5 years 9 patients with a total of 16 painful ear nodules (chondrodermatitis helicis) have been treated as follows.	1.1705248794183987
A small excision is carried out with local anaesthesia for histological examination.	0.8944764346923402
The rest of the nodule or any other nodules are carbonized by means of the argon laser, also with local anaesthesia, including the surface of the cartilage under the nodules.	1.0500778894613667
There have been no cases of postoperative inflammation or infection.	0.892564158789392
New nodules occurring several months after treatment have been successfully treated in the same way.	1.1892959195340795
There have been no real recurrences.	0.7614845926996165
The cosmetic result is very good in all cases.	0.9972960533131758
The patients are free of pain immediately after the laser therapy.	0.8535379272846871
Laser therapy for painful nodules of the ear has good and lasting results, with a lower rate of recurrences than any other form of treatment.	1.1414179974354348
We represent and discuss etiology, diagnosis as well as differential diagnoses of tuberculous orchtitis referring to an actual case of this rare disease.	1.0176392511687604
In the least of all cases one can conclude from the clinical symptoms on the tuberculous origin of the disease.	1.097685043338393
Other differential diagnoses will set more frequently due to rarity of this disease.	0.7336553119517536
Quite a lot of cases a bacterial superinfection veils the sterile leucocyturia as main characteristic of genitourinary tuberculosis.	0.8410501308945207
Imaging diagnostics frequently fails to give indications of tuberculous origin of the lesion.	0.7924859760147784
As before the evidence of Mycobacteria tuberculosis is the most important parameter to proof a tuberculosis.	1.0126864567452918
Despite required microbiological cultivation to make a resistogram the polymerase chain reaction is a high sensitive and comparable fast method for detection of Mycobacteria even from tissue.	0.9650824472285688
In such dubious cases we recommend to perform an operative denudation due to frequently difficult delimitation from malignant testicular tumours.	0.8490873062003398
In surgical procedures associated with high blood loss, such as vascular and cardiac operations, differential diagnosis and therapy of perioperative hemorrhage are of special importance.	1.1022878065989536
Preoperative screening for patients at high risk of bleeding and in particular for those with qualitative platelet disorders [drug-induced platelet disorders (in particular ASS), von Willebrand's disease and other congenital platelet disorders] is effective in minimizing blood loss.	1.2567669668454342
Bleeding in acute medical emergencies or during emergency operations may require treatment without specific investigations being performed in advance.	0.8900533659812055
Therefore, simple schemes are essential for the rapid management of acute hemostatic problems.	1.310447358919389
The aim of this paper was to address the diagnostic and therapy of hemorrhagic diathesis focusing mainly on diagnosis and therapy of hemorrhagic diathesis due to blood platelet disorders and blood coagulation disorders and preoperative identification of patients at increased risk of bleeding.	1.1390767852539139
Although deep vein thrombosis now has a better prognosis than in the era before anticoagulation, a number of patients remain in whom ulcus cruris cannot be adequately controlled by conservative treatment.	1.0750429600723543
The case report of a 50-year-old woman with stage III chronic venous insufficiency associated with the post-thrombotic syndrome is presented.	1.0302881238299726
Progress in imaging techniques and functional diagnostics of the post-thrombotic syndrome make a reliable differentiation of the chronic venous insufficiency possible with respect to obstruction or reflux.	0.9625627315367318
If conservative treatment fails, autological valve transplantation is described as a suitable reconstructive management method in the treatment of reflux.	0.8954457574659639
Following this report, the results and limitations of this method are discussed.	1.4099482209818233
The neurobiological alterations commonly found in affective disorders (e.g., alterations in the nocturnal sleep profile, dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical system) gradually recover with improvement of the depressive syndrome.	0.8676360400492639
Their persistence during full clinical remission, however, is associated with an increased risk for relapse and, thus may represent trait markers for affective disorders.	1.0045631132147048
In order to test this hypothesis, we designed a prospective study in which healthy first-degree relatives (high-risk probands; HRPs; n=54) of patients with an affective disorder are investigated by means of polysomnography, the combined dexamethasone and corticotropine-releasing hormone (DEX-CRH) test and a variety of psychometric scales.	1.130558151143702
In the present part of the study (index assessment), these HRPs, as a group, showed depressionlike alterations in both the sleep pattern and the DEX-CRH-test outcome; furthermore, their psychometric profile was characterized by elevated scores on the scales assessing "rigidity" and "autonomic lability".	1.3234712580766177
On a single-case level, 35% of the HRPs were identified as conspicuous (depressionlike) in at least two of the three areas investigated.	1.2958297607806089
A decision of whether or not this "conspicuousness" indeed represents a trait marker for affective disorders can be reached when the follow-up part of the study has identified those HRPs with their respective premorbide status who have developed an affective disorder in the meantime.	1.0430780154770343
Undifferentiated connective tissue disease with secondary antiphospholipid syndrome was diagnosed in a 33 year old woman after recurrent arterial thromboses, two miscarriages and myocarditis.	1.067799037994304
Despite effective immunosuppression and anticoagulation her initially mild precapillary pulmonary hypertension progressed in the absence of thromboembolic events, cardiopulmonary disease or other systemic disorders.	0.8754211094681611
iloprost in a dosage of up to 4.5 ng/kg/min for a total of 15 months, her 6 min walking-distance improved from 210 to 315 m, the pulmonary vascular resistance decreased from 1710 to 1111 dynxsxcm-5 and the mean pulmonary arterial pressure decreased from 64 to 54 mmHg.	1.0857409918199792
This partial success of conservative treatment enabled a reassessment of the necessity for heart and lung transplantation.	0.8241025781894431
In the USA, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) has been approved for therapy of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) within a 3 hour time window based on the results of the NINDS [1] trial.	1.037172980757167
