As a final result an unscientific era comes about, on which Karl Jaspers commented in 1945 that only this unscientific spirit had made National Socialism possible.	0.8971372976953823
Based on the good statistical results of German obstetrics compared to those of foreign countries, it is shown that our patients' demands for "gentle" obstetrics can be combined with the requirements of safe obstetrics.	1.0851070895054402
If the professional interests of doctors and midwives are joint together, "safe and gentle" obstetrics should result in the common goal of a healthy child and a happy mother.	1.0865551336187016
Objectives: Due to its unique pharmacokinetics, the new esterase-metabolised opioid remifentanil results in rapid post-anaesthesia recovery.	1.0199823519623639
The aim of this clinical investigation was to compare recovery times after remifentanil anaesthesia in combination with hypnotic concentrations of either propofol or isoflurane.	1.11577804824211
Dosages used in the study protocol were based on recommendations by the pharmaceutical manufacturer.	1.1410762101528102
Methods: Patients (ASA status I-II) scheduled for elective arthroscopy were included in this trial.	0.9969913323668023
Without premedication in the morning, anaesthesia was induced identically in both groups: remifentanil bolus (1 µg/kg), start of remifentanil-infusion (0.5 µg/kg/min), followed immediately by propofol (ca.	1.212532643731856
For maintenance of anaesthesia remifentanil (0.25 µg/kg/min) was combined with either a propofol infusion of 0.1 mg/kg/min or 0.5 MAC isoflurane (=0.6 vol.%) in O2/air.	1.1354180675838152
Anaesthetic delivery was discontinued simultaneously with termination of surgery and recovery times were recorded.	0.9247480833091515
Results: A total of 40 patients were studied at random in two groups of 20 each with comparable demographic data and anaesthetic technique (Tables 1 and 2).	1.1119986789563
In both groups emergence was very rapid.	0.8417068515757182
Recovery times were significantly shorter for remifentanil-isoflurane than for remifentanil-propofol (Table 3): spontaneous ventilation 5.1 vs 8.1 min (P<0.05), extubation 5.5 vs. 8.6 min (P<0.02), post-anaesthesia recovery score >=9 of 10 points 6.2 vs 11.3 min (P<0.01), and arrival at PACU 16.2 vs 19.2 min (P<0.01).	1.101480929860435
Mild to moderate shivering was noted in 40% of all patients (9 cases following isoflurane, 7 following propofol).	1.1408203686125913
Conclusions: Using the manufacturer's recommended dosages, emergence after remifentanil anaesthesia is more rapid with 0.5 MAC isoflurane than with 0.1 mg/kg/min propofol.	1.158617629321862
These results are most probably due to the different pharmacological properties of both co-anaesthetics, especially the applied dosages, and to different interactions with remifentanil.	1.3004440558226824
Present clinical experience suggests that a further dose reduction, especially for propofol, is possible.	1.2627369185837916
For both remifentanil groups emergence was remarkably rapid between return of consciousness and the awake state (on-off phenomenon), which might contribute to post-anaesthesia safety.	1.106206462488486
Exposure of the skin to ultraviolet irradiation is an important risk factor for the development of malignant melanoma, with UVA possibly playing an important role.	1.1682098850788019
Hereditary factors are also relevant.	0.6612671307601506
In the dysplastic nevus syndrome a genetic instability has been shown by different methods.	1.042677786006329
In xeroderma pigmentosum the DNA repair defect is thought to be responsible for the high incidence of malignant melanoma.	0.8562422949615242
Frequent and non-random changes in certain chromosomes have been demonstrated in melanoma cells.	0.8903584655520489
These might contain sequences that control melanoma growth or melanoma suppressor genes.	0.6929401910479575
Especially the short arm of chromosome 9 is thought to contain one of these genes.	1.0053854276816308
This hypothesis is supported by a genetic linkage analysis in melanoma families and the demonstration of a germ line deletion of the locus 9p21 in a patient with eight primary melanomas.	1.0606085703897852
Changes in known tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes have also been reported in melanoma, but no consistent sequence of genetic events is known.	1.0757929900209602
Neuropsychological studies could demonstrate increased risk for impaired attention and short term memory as well as a general reduced information processing speed in childhood's epilepsy.	1.118944837127279
Up to now it is not totally understood if focal EEG-pathology represents a specific cognitive deficit strongly related to the corresponding hemisphere's functions or represents a less lateralized but more general cognitive deficit of both cerebral hemispheres.	0.984527011012593
In a sample of 44 pediatric patients with epilepsy we studied sequential and simultaneous cognitive information processing.	0.7592711861736223
As a major result a general decreased function in cognitive information processing (more sequential than simultaneous) has been found.	1.0656434772214696
There was no correlation with the localization of an EEG-Focus nor with the hand preference.	1.0624355912164964
According to previous studies patients with an increased number of medical drugs or with presence of neuroradiological lesions are at greatest risk for cognitive impairment.	1.0506817367560168
Our data indicate a possible affection of underlying metamemory functions.	0.7234481993111572
The aim of this prospective and randomized study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a reduced shock strength in transvenous implantable defibrillator therapy.	1.172987099359002
So far clinical data concerning the safety margin of the shock energy in ICD therapy do not exist.	0.8699396606463656
The shock energy tested during long-term follow-up in this study was twice the intraoperatively measured defibrillation threshold (DFT).	1.1431215971580797
A total number of 176 consecutive patients representing a typical cohort of ICD patients were evaluated.	0.9301228767195312
All patients received a non-thoracotomy lead system (CPI, Endotak 0070, 0090) and a biphasic cardioverter-defibrillator with the ability to store episodes (Cardiac Pacemakers Inc., Ventac TM PRx II, PRx III).	1.080104587789921
The intraoperative defibrillation threshold (DFT) was evaluated in a step-down protocol (15, 10, 8, 5 J) and hat to be <=15 J for inclusion into the study.	1.1229823366343574
The lowest effective energy terminating induced ventricular fibrillation had to be confirmed and was defined as DFT+ augmented defibrillation threshold.	0.9150300576749049
The DFT+ value was tested immediately after successful implantation, at discharge, and after a follow-up period of one year.	1.2183281763064089
Prior to implantation the patients were randomized into two groups.	1.0112901851550726
The energy of the first shock in the study group was programmed at twice DFT+ and in the control group at the maximum energy output (34 J).	1.2223286790020567
The efficacy of the first shock and its reproducibility in DFT testings and in spontaneous episodes during long-term follow-up of the study group were compared to those in the control group.	1.2312766205582315
A DFT+ value was found to be <=15 J in 166 of 176 patients (94%).	0.7693293431570059
The DFT+ in the study group was 9.6+/-3.2; in control group 10.1+/-.35 J.	1.1324626298563736
The prohability of successful defibrillation at DFT+ level after one year was 84%.	0.7782657985921178
The success rate of the first shock meant to terminate induced ventricular fibrillation (VF) was 99.5% in the study group (217 of 218 episodes) and 99% in the control group (201 of 203 episodes).	1.1840010900507751
During follow-up of 24+/-9 months spontaneous episodes in the study group, 83/86 (96.5) monomorphic ventricular tachycardias (MVT) and 38/40 (95%) VF-episodes were converted successfully by the 2x DFT+ shock.	1.2163726539454307
In the control group the first shock was successful in 151/156 (96.8%) spontaneous MVTs and in 30/33 (91%) VF episodes.	1.2429623672977714
The efficacy of the first shock was not influenced by clinical data such as the underlying cardiac disease, left ventricular function, ongoing antiarrhythmic therapy with amiodarone, or the number of spontaneous episodes per day or by the DFT itself.	1.1864948189347881
At a mean follow-up of two years there was no significant difference between the two groups concerning the incidence of sudden cardiac death (2.4% in the study group vs. 3.8% in the control group).	1.4399839773178098
In conclusion programming the first shock with the ICD lead system used in this study at 2x DFT+ is as efficient as a shock energy of 34 J in order to terminate induced and spontaneous episodes of VT/VF.	1.0930127732536692
Thus, the safety of ICD-therapy is not impaired when programming the shock energy at the 2x DFT+ value.	1.1145938393846055
Culpable deficits of the preoperative information cause a complete illegality of the whole medical intervention and lead to liability for any resulting damage.	0.9715024376057665
In cases of controversy it's the physician's due to prove the correct preoperative information.	0.9528943432371475
To reduce these liability-risks a computer based information system has been developed.	0.8515191049527734
With its help an working sheet is provided which is individually adjusted for the patient.	0.7605124673213208
Based upon this record the real preoperative information takes place.	0.7413206439814622
After the patient signed the record the physician keeps it at his disposal for proving the contents of the preoperative information.	0.9295080670041762
The conception's use over many years shows that overlooking essential aspects and misunderstanding can grossly be excluded for the patient and a high quality of information can be reached.	1.0548968821695737
In vitro culture of peritoneal explants of neonatal rats after previous application of agents simulating wound antisepsis is a sensitive screening method for the determination of the tissue compatibility of local wound antiinfectives.	1.0037117397985393
Two test models are differentiated: (1) separated peritoneal explants as a model for chronic or deep wounds and (2) peritoneum in situ in the experimental animal with subsequent extraction and cultivation of the explants.	1.012595817549356
Considering the present state of knowledge the following conclusions can be drawn regarding antisepsis of wounds: Lavasept (0.1 %) may be classified as the agent of choice for deep and chronic wounds, for drip-suck irrigation and for antiinfective lavage of body cavities inclusively for peritoneal lavage (0,05 %).	1.1714939095492416
Taurolidin is antiseptically effective in long term application ( > 6 h), and because of its antitoxic effect as well as lack of cytotoxicity it is especially suitable for peritoneal lavage.	1.038813062362466
Betaisodona solution is very well suited for superficial contaminated wounds and can be used in a dilution of 1 : 10 for short-term rinsing of deep wounds, including body cavities but not for peritoneal lavage.	1.1678499233863127
Ethanol causes no inhibition of explant growth and therefore retains its importance in wound antisepsis.	0.846880399348384
Pain is a widely occurring disturbance of well-being and has serious consequences for the quality of life of patients suffering from acute or chronic pain.	1.0513391549344335
Thus, pain makes high demands on the health system.	1.1484922795099832
For the first time in the Federal Republic of Germany the National Health Interview and Examination Survey allows to make representative statements concerning the prevalence of pain, its intensity, frequency, duration and localisation.	0.9874772819214984
Furthermore, the results enable to differentiate according to age, gender, and social classes.	1.1777101760478903
The SF-36, used as an instrument to measure health related quality of life, has been employed to demonstrate the overwhelming significance of pain for the well-being of the population.	1.1096525195286588

Death may occur while a fleeing or resisting suspect is taken into custody by the police.	0.815263518811395
We report about this type of acute death in two males.	1.0887906111177388
In both cases, a cocaine intoxication was taken as the cause of death despite an initial suspicion of a direct association between the death and police measures (e.g.	0.9276931297885779
neck compression or "headlock", chest compression).	1.1628746074172762
From the Institute's autopsy material we selected another 12 cases with monointoxication by cocaine as the cause of death of as a secondary finding for comparison.	0.9015179235568408
Of the 12 cases 5 were gunshot injuries and 4 were classified as suicide.	0.8641718958591602
The analysis suggested an increased willingness to apply force against themselves or others under the influence of cocaine.	0.7826428014700786
In both cases, cardiac arrest occurred suddenly and unexpectedly for all those involved and who were unaware of any acute life-threatening situation because of the extreme attempts of the suspects to flee or resist arrest.	1.0223766475478313
Attention should be given to these types of cases during the training of police officers.	1.005518839963964

It was of interest whether there is a risk of HCV transmission from the corpses.	1.0424375131803258
The presence of HCV-RNA indicates infectiosity in the living but this may be different post-mortem.	1.0213343433779558
To our knowledge no case of HVC infection from a corpse has been reported so far.	1.072518236306506
Non-traumatic duodenocaval fistulae are rare, but may be the source of massive gastrointestional bleeding with associated fever and sepsis.	0.972562605138283
These fistulae result from penetrating duodenal peptic ulcers or right nephrectomy and subsequent radiation to the upper abdomen.	0.8103884631116557
The outcome depends on early diagnosis and surgery before a potentially fatal hemorrhage occurs.	0.9577060974832896
The therapy of choice includes closure of the fistula and repair of the duodenum and inferior vena cava.	0.9324494643128111
We describe the seventh case with radiogenic duodenal ulcer.	0.9329111169099189
Gastrointestinal bleeding occurred 10 years after radical nephrectomy and radiation (60 Gy).	0.9803832416626551

Purpose: Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) induces variable functional deficits depending on the grade of vascular occlusion and its localisation.	1.0695064378261623
Theses deficiences are not easily defined by visual acuity measurements.	0.8038184240321982
However, microperimetry offers topical mapping of retinal function, allowing precise documentation of the intensity and dimension of retinal functional loss in BRVO.	1.1494577612045345
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is rare but beset with a high mortality rate.	0.9412355055606918
In recent years, however, a trend towards higher survival rates has been observed.	0.8763114188202414
High inspiratory oxygen concentrations, large tidal volumes, and high peak inspiratory airway pressures applied during mechanical ventilation have been identified as harmful to the lung and can contribute to the progression of ARDS.	1.0942014665354458
This had led to reconsideration of the sequelae of ventilatory therapy.	0.7183875530522349
Mechanical ventilation and other adjunctive strategies in ARDS have changed from the conventional approach aiming at normalisation of physiological ventilatory parameters to an elaborated approach that intends to protect the ventilated lung, prevent oxygen toxicity, recruit the infiltrated atelectatic and consolidated lung and reduce the anatomical and alveolar dead space.	0.9124359427586481
This new approach consists of various forms of pressure-controlled mechanical ventilation with PEEP and permissive hypercapnia, body position changes, and inhalation of nitric oxide.	0.9808132071706801
Should these procedures fail to improve impaired gas exchange, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is an additional therapeutic option.	0.8212352252671037
None of these therapeutic procedures, however, has been tested against traditional standard treatment in a classical randomised controlled trial.	1.1913468137325616
The following review focuses on the latest insights into the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of ARDS.	0.9720611471288265
Femoral neck fractures are frequent fractures of the elderly.	1.0662827411668332
They can be treated by the use of dynamic hip screws, lag screws, bipolar hemiprotheses or total hip replacement.	0.9231761353961194
The results are markedly influenced by the timing of the operation and the choice of the implant.	1.167511499136201
Using the Garden classification of femoral neck fracture we demonstrate a different therapeutic approach according to Garden stadium I-IV.	0.8893757606501242
Stool frequency after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is about 5/day after adaptation during the first year.	1.1538433173452345
It depends on stool volume and pouch capacity, not on the design of the pouch.	1.0301909947116574
In most cases evacuation is spontaneous and as complete as in healthy rectum.	0.8965170571770378
67 % of patients are perfectly continent, while 19 % have to wear pads due to intermittent leakage.	1.3980811450626651

We describe a patient who was admitted to hospital because of hypoglycemic convulsions at the age of 6 months.	0.990358275363131
Diagnostics revealed that the hypoglycemic episodes were caused by glycogen synthase deficiency.	0.8080720014754041
Glycogen synthase deficiency its a rare cause of fasting hypoglycemia in childhood associated with normal production of ketone bodies.	0.8533157920259885
It is characterized by supranormal increase of glucose and lactate in blood after a meal or an oral glucose tolerance test.	0.8363825863907597
Diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of a reduced activity of glycogen synthase in liver tissue, and lately also by identification of pathogenic mutations in the glycogensynthase gene (GYS2-gene).	0.9498277612160574
Hypoglycemic episodes can be prevented by offering frequent protein-rich meals during the day and a late evening meal with uncooked corn starch.	0.9090869518278616
Although most subacromial decompressions are performed arthroscopically, rotator cuff repair is still performed using an open or mini-open procedure.	0.8893402021490093
Arthroscopic techniques have improved in the last decade, however, so that rotator cuff repair can also be performed arthroscopically.	1.2232733326341116
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a well-established method for the diagnosis of diseases of the heart and the great vessels.	1.160574575172816
Almost 20% of all patients cannot be completely examined by transthoracic echocardiography.	1.028404946003941
In this patient group, MRI can be used as a second line technique to provide important diagnostic information not obtainable by echocardiography.	1.055649510178423
However, there are clinical problems for which MRI may be used as the first line technique such as complex congenital heart disease, diseases of the great vessels, pericardial disease or cardiac tumors.	1.285580979815213
MRI is undergoing rapid technical improvement and this will further improve the diagnostic utility of the technique, especially in patients with coronary artery disease.	0.9128653719007895
In the last 7 years we have performed 220 infrainguinal vein bypasses associated with critical limb ischemia.	0.9885720893171226
All patients were prospectively controlled in a follow-up program 3 - 72 months postoperatively.	1.142357555759261
The patients were divided into two groups: patients with diabetes mellitus (35%, group 1) and patients without diabetes mellitus (65%, group 2).	1.2871563881474728
There was no difference in sex, age or localization of distal anastomosis (supra- or infragenicular) between the two groups.	1.0623501574466327
The primary and the primary-assisted patency rates were not statistically different after 60 months.	0.9478281063706286
There was a significant difference in limb salvage.	0.9989169929567976
The limb salvage of group 1 was 75% after 60 months, while the limb salvage of group 2 was 95% (P = 0.0045).	1.1018175075899683
The rate of major amputations was significantly higher in group 1 (15.6%) than in group 2 (4.9%, P = 0.007).	1.327806864876503
The indication for amputation was persistent foot infection.	0.7263978974987159
A 24-year-old woman with lymph vessel dysplasia had experienced a progressive edema of her legs since her second year of life and progressive facial edema for the past year.	1.0226670886792733
She also had telangiectasias and papules on the background of a diffuse erythema as well as marked seborrhea on her face.	0.9083355392602073
Histopathological examination of a representative facial lesion revealed a granulomatous dermatitis with periadnexal distribution mainly consisting of lymphocytes and histiocytes.	0.8511696458572463
In addition, there was a moderate fibrosis of the dermis with numerous mast cells.	1.1343975161993136
By duplex ultrasound, a diagnosis of a massive edema of the legs without evidence for chronic venous insufficiency was made.	1.1700238950861501
The clinical and histopathological findings were consistent with solid persistent erythema and edema of the face associated with rosacea and lymph vessel dysplasia.	0.9850452432555556
The chronic course, absence of serological abnormalities and nonspecific histopathological features as well as resistance to therapy are the most important diagnostic cirteria of this disease also known as Morbihan's disease.	1.0968886419949215
The cervical spine is an extremely complex functional unit and has always been the subject of impassioned discussions among surgeons, orthopedic specialists and neurologists.	0.973092407204674
In the presence of injuries affecting this section of the spine, which sometimes have grave consequences - including implications for legal insurance aspects, neurologists are usually at the end of the line when it comes to diagnosis and treatment.	1.0653011195303608
In fact, in view of the clinical and technical neurophysiological options available to neurologists, it would be desirable for them to be involved as early as possible.	1.1265419294101637
In this paper the relative value of neurology, compared with orthopedics and surgery, in the diagnosis and treatment of whiplash injury to the cervical spine is discussed.	1.209469493108937
The newer options available - particularly in neurophysiology - are highlighted, as are the differential diagnosis and problems concerned with official expert assessments, which also involve other specialties.	1.3678192573343637
A 19-year-old male patient with chronic cutaneous leishmaniosis was treated topically with paromomycin sulphate (15%) and methylbenzethonium chloride (12%) in petrolatum album.	1.1140957645375507
After application twice daily for two periods of 32 and 44 days the lesions were completely healed.	0.9169319389547221
Previous treatment for 9 months with ketoconazole (400 mg/day) together with the topical application of thiabendazole (2.5%) in base had been unsuccessful.	1.0929382974621016

In seven cases, progressive neurological deficits had developed, some of which led to complete paraplegia.	1.1980273484871249
On all eight patients operations were performed.	0.7121144850062149
After an average of 11 weeks' follow-up, full recovery from the preoperative pain and neurological deficits could be seen in 6 of the patients.	1.1589219984705545
The confusion of scientific, economic, juridical and professional contexts is the reason for the present uneasiness within therapeutic culture.	0.9698949442277057
The author pleads for autonomy of these contexts to defend the profession reasonably against powerful overdetermination by other contexts.	0.7624705261536785
The debate about EST ("empirically supported therapy") is being drawn upon to show that the list of criteria for differentiation of effective and ineffective therapies is not warranted.	1.1770362833344457
Scientific or economic dominance claims might have deteriorating effects in the professional fields, as well-known researchers meanwhile fear.	1.1236894193065448
In economic contexts the aim is efficiency, in professional contexts it is quality.	1.0777981377130468
To develop own quality measures has the aim to promote the profession as a learning organization.	0.8913782523604045
This could help to rise professionals' self-confidence.	0.7201597409390057
Procalcitonin is the propeptide of calcitonin devoid of hormonal activity.	0.6125309813739904
Normally, procalcitonin is produced in the C-cells of the thyroid gland.	0.4948816815879654
In healthy humans procalcitonin levels are undetectable (<0.1 ng/ml).	1.2043368239882795
During severe generalized infections (bacterial, parasitic and fungal) with systemic manifestations, procalcitonin levels may rise up to 100 ng/ml.	1.0271041112774706
In contrast, severe viral infections or inflammatory reactions of non-infectious origin do not or very moderately increase procalcitonin levels.	1.071252196345436
The exact site of procalcitonin production is not exactly known but even large amounts of procalcitonin released during infections do not lead to an increase in plasma calcitonin level or activity.	0.9096275563412148
In this retrospective study, oncologic and functional results of 24 patients treated for glomus jugulare tumor stages C and D are reported.	0.9894685669157813
The surgical approach used was a combined transmastoid-transcervical approach, which was modified according to individual tumor growth.	1.1801422826714607
As needed, this was combined with a transtemporal or retrosigmoid approach.	1.054523977895847
Complete tumor removal resulted in a cure rate of 100%.	0.9237897524025198
Surgically induced cranial nerve palsies developed in 38% of the patients.	0.7803757442062826
In 54% of cases it was possible to retain middle ear function.	1.3113968232038073
Seven patients had incomplete tumor removal requiring postoperative irradiation, with tumor progression occurring in 2 patients.	1.0230024881344455
Radical tumor removal was modified by efforts to reduce mutilating resections.	0.8030595175885714
These results show that individually tailored and combined multidirectional surgical approaches can allow total tumor removal to be performed with lower morbidity.	1.0527724253723925
Electron beam CT, which does not require mechanical movement of an X-ray tube, has a temporal resolution which exceeds that of conventional computed tomography by a factor of about ten.	1.1309643993925413
Axial images of the heart can be acquired within 50 to 100 ms with a spatial resolution below 0.5 mm2 and permit precise visualization of all cardiac structures.	1.074316276095968
ECG-triggered acquisition of 30 to 40 axial images (3 mm slice thickness) in a short inspiratory breathhold allows one to sample a 3-dimensional volume data set which covers the complete heart.	1.190414029980048
Overall acquisition times are approximately 30 to 50 seconds.	0.7638911180853774
While electron beam CT in general permits a complete cardiac investigation, including morphology, function, and perfusion, the method's most important application is non-invasive imaging of the coronary arteries.	1.0787772116179162
Without contrast enhancement, coronary calcification by EBCT currently constitutes the most sensitive non-invasive marker for the presence even of very early forms of coronary atherosclerosis.	1.0088238298859975
Intraveneous injection of contrast agent during image acquisition additionally permits the selective visualization of the coronary artery lumen and detection of significant stenoses.	0.9775167498869807
This method is especially well suited in the follow-up of coronary interventions and coronary bypass grafting.	1.1837972458222077
Breathhold and movement artifacts, superposition of coronary arteries and veins, as well as severe coronary calcifications currently constitute the method's main problems.	0.8605872616838938
In spite of these limitations, electron beam CT has been shown to permit clinically valuable non-invasive investigations of the coronary arteries, which may be further refined as technology progresses.	1.1104078447745998
Despite the availability of diagnostic modalities such as transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging up to 30% of patients with acute aortic dissection remain undiagnosed before death.	1.0106432941837933
A novel immunoassay of serum smooth muscle myosin as a potential diagnostic tool for the detection of aortic dissection.	0.8840697907846014
The immunoassay was applied in two patients with an acute chest pain syndrome but no initial suspicion of aortic disease.	1.1350427747574865
In both patients myocardial ischemia was ruled out by laboratory, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic examination.	0.9119068874543856
In the first patient both dilation of the aortas and long-standing arterial hypertension were known; however, it was not before 48h until dissection was suspected and a spiral-CT was performed demonstrating a localized ascending aortic dissection.	1.1620909872923508
At this time (48 h after onset of symptoms) the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain concentration in the serum was close to normal.	1.1485766208147974
In the other patient there was neither a suggestive history nor any clinical sign of aortic dissection.	0.896799887527222
Widening of the abdominal was the key to the incidental diagnosis of a clinically unsuspected type B dissection.	1.1624993535895436
The serum test 12 h after onset of pain revealed elevated (diagnostic) serum levels of smooth muscle myosin heavy chains.	0.9155774327168156
Recurrent abdominal pain is found in 10-25% of school-aged children, thus being one of the most frequent complaints in childhood.	1.2376931743263087
Despite that, our knowledge about this syndrome is still very incomplete.	1.1425228654405832
Following oral surgery, there are sometimes disturbances in wound healing.	1.0738944868806015
It was the aim of this investigation to look for relationships between the composition of saliva and disturbed wound healing.	0.9748779286846249
Resting as well as stimulated fasting whole saliva was collected from 96 patients (19 to 53 years of age) prior to oral surgery.	0.9382643698206473
Flow rate, pH, standard bicarbonate, total buffer bases, peroxidase, lysozyme, thiocyanate, secretory immunoglobulin A, lactoferrin, total protein, tissue type plasminogen activator, and plasminogen activator inhibitor were determined.	0.9743677664941371
The salivary data of eight patients who suffered from disturbed wound healing were compared to the data of 20 randomly selected patients with normal wound healing.	1.0836740571338328
Patients with disturbed wound healing revealed increased activities and secretion rates for peroxidase in resting saliva.	0.7349977564146277
In stimulated saliva, decreased secretion rates for thiocyanate and total protein were found.	0.8663658437287266
Not a single salivary factor was able to discriminate both groups of patients with sufficient accuracy, but with a combination of tissue type plasminogen activator, peroxidase, plus secretory immunoglobulin A measurements from resting whole saliva a clearly improved and acceptable discrimination of the two patient groups was possible.	1.0255995057905882
A discriminant function including six salivary factors could be used to completely separate both groups.	0.9131642822041254
Nuclear imaging methods provide noninvasive indexes of myocardial function, perfusion, and metabolism and are well accepted in clinical cardiology.	1.0548732141309636
Advances in prevention and treatment of cardiac disease have resulted in decreasing cardiovascular mortality in industrialized nations.	0.9476654548406981
The improvement in therapeutic options has increased the demand for diagnostic tests that might guide clinical decision making.	0.9171606204853185
Information beyond the pure anatomic characterization of coronary stenoses is required.	0.783502931579164
Nuclear imaging can be used for early detection and monitoring of the severity and extent of disease.	1.2517116311571084
The prognostic potential of such functional testing is being increasingly appreciated and used to guide therapy, thereby resulting in improvement of the quality and cost-effectiveness of the workup of patients with cardiovascular disease.	1.1843345669049072
Extensive clinical validation has resulted in growing acceptance of these techniques.	0.8966064786583182
Furthermore, ongoing improvement of imaging techniques and development of new radiopharmaceuticals will pave the way for disease-specific, molecular-targeted cardiac imaging in the future.	1.1736918566551429
Epidural anaesthesia for elective caesarean section can have advantages over general anaesthesia.	0.7613460269403005
The anaesthesiologist can avoid endotracheal intubation as well as fetal depression following placental transfer of systemic anaesthetics.	0.8783524006509457
However, despite reaching an effective blockade preoperatively, intraoperative discomfort and pain may occur during epidural anaesthesia with local anaesthetics alone, necessitating supplemental systemic analgesics or even conversion to general anaesthesia [21].	1.158447058416011
Addition of epidural fentanyl has been shown to improve onset and quality of perioperative analgesia without evident side effects for mother or newborn [24].	0.9883483845671218
Nevertheless, administration of epidural opioids before cord clamping is still hotly debated, some fearing maternal and or neonatal depression [6, 26].	1.1890647911817058
The aim of the present study was to investigate the quality of analgesia, associated side effects and the resulting maternal and neonatal plasma opiate concentrations after a single preoperative addition of 0.1 mg fentanyl to epidural bupivacaine analgesia in comparison to epidural bupivacaine analgesia alone.	1.1173642991761479
The quality of the morphological analysis of myocardial and coronary alterations depends essentially on the method chosen for the heart dissection.	1.0358863853822158
Even if previous postmortem coronary angioplasty is not feasible, the best results are obtained by transverse sectioning of the ventricles in a bread-loaf fashion subsequent to formalin-fixation and serial cross-sectioning of the coronary arteries, with decalcification in addition if necessary.	1.0492208061965167
The distribution pattern of disseminated myocardial necrosis, the longitudinal, circumferential and transmural extent of infarction, its age and sequelae and its correlation to the coronary supplying areas can be evaluated with better accuracy than by dissecting the heart chambers according to the flow of blood.	1.1274271215521279
Cross-sectioning of coronary arteries with preservation of their luminal shape allows proper examination of the degree and extent of luminal narrowing, plaque hemorrhage, parietal and occluding thrombi and the effects and complications of angioplastic procedures or bypass surgery.	1.0192769353070328
Transverse sectioning of the heart is a prerequisite for adequate examination following sudden cardiac death and short-term territorial ischemia.	0.9876934873973916
Full-thickness samples of the ventricular walls, taken systematically with respect to coronary narrowing and coronary supplying areas, enable identification of early myocardial damage.	0.9905585635840856
Total hip replacement is one of the most successful procedures in surgery.	1.1096759312520963
In Germany there is a great variety of cemented and uncemented implants with different principles of fixation.	0.9947683746926166
We reviewed the different principles, with particular reference to long-term clinical outcome, and discuss the most popular systems available in Germany.	1.094949833290157
Despite many new developments which have been made in the field of cementless hip replacement, cemented total hip arthroplasty will remain the "gold standard" until prospective long-term data (>15 years) of cementless systems become available.	1.1124971001813215
To summarize current knowledge on surgical therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and diverticulitis).	0.8846816887175415
Procalcitonin is a propeptide of calcitonin.	0.536879037547161
It is usually not detectable in healthy volunteers but appears in high concentrations in the serum of patients with severe bacterial, parasitic or fungal infection.	1.0596324228378493
In contrast, procalcitonin levels do not or only moderately increase during viral infections or during non-infectious systemic inflammatory states.	1.0724726082446818
Because of these properties, procalcitonin has been proposed to serve as a marker of severe infections and sepsis.	1.0918210435801046
Increased procalcitonin levels have recently been shown to indicate the severity of systemic infection with increasing specificity.	1.095168058321968
Normally, procalcitonin is produced in the C-cells of the thyroid gland.	0.4948816815879654
The origin of the high levels of procalcitonin in septic conditions is not fully understood.	0.9018583275484471
Although procalcitonin has drawn attention as a marker of severe systemic infections, a recent study suggests it may also be a mediator of sepsis.	1.054511668523999
More studies are needed to uncover the nature and pathophysiological role of this molecule.	0.8374927267709344
Fractures of the hand sceleton are common injuries.	0.961858271070629
These are or are associated with phalangeal fractures.	0.7256741833876191
Kirschner wires can be used for osteosynthesis, but can cause lesions of periphereal finger structures.	1.1874432198133549
The aim of our study was to record the incidence of lesions in peripherial structures of the fingers caused by retrograde crossed inserted Kirschner wires of 1.0, 1.25, 1.4 and 1.6 mm diameter into the middle and proximal phalanges of the long fingers and the proximal phalanx of the thumb of 120 fresh cadaver hands.	1.3673398327829087
We found an increase of insertion attempt frequency and an increasing number of lesions with increasing Kirschner wire diameter.	1.0430014474576976
Because of these findings Kirschner wires of 1.0 or 1.25 mm diameter should be prefered to prevent the periphereal functional finger structures.	1.0649644944505963
Fucosidosis, a rare lysosomal storage disease due to nearly complete deficiency of -L- fucosidase, was diagnosed in two unrelated male German patients who exhibited typical symptoms of this disorder including mental retardation, dysostosis multiplex, vacuolization of lymphocytes and progressive neurologic deterioration by the age of 3.2 and 4 years, respectively.	1.1287201752777576
In both cases, activity of -L-fucosidase in leukocytes and cultivated fibroblasts was negligible.	0.8740647918524885
DNA analysis revealed a nonsense mutation (G401X) in exon 7 of the fucosidase gene; this leads to a premature stop codon and C-terminal deletion of 61 amino acids from the protein.	0.9939950358206134
Discussion: On account of the mutation a unique PFlMI restriction site is obliterated; this simplifies molecular diagnosis of the G401X mutation.	1.0667788264200622
So far, the mutation G401X has not been found in any other population.	1.0817817468291557
The main reason for posttraumatic secondary brain damage is cerebral hypoxia.	0.817153412820942
Both, severity and duration of hypoxia are crucial in determining wether irreversible cerebral infarction will occur or not.	0.9074591613105712
For the clinical routine, the diagnosis of hypoxia is indirectly made by low CPP, low jugularvenous oxygen saturation (SjO2) or low tissue PO2.	1.136925217972758
To minimize misleading false negative SjO2, the CT-Approach for the side of monitorig and calculation of arterial-jugularvenous lactate content for detection of anaerobic metabolism is recommended.	1.0120734238809097
Targeted treatment of hypoxia according to the underlying cause is mandatory.	1.080561162271543
Primary goal is to increase cellular oxygen delivery by correction of low arterial oxygen content and elevation of regional CBF.	0.9715796841496872
Within the autoregulatory range decreasing CPP causes vasodilation and increasing CPP vasoconstriction with increasing or decreasing cerebral blood volume respectively.	0.8121460383573859
Initially elevation of the lower autoregulatory threshold often requires CPP 70 mmHg.	0.9658518288857595
Targeted treatment of intracranial hypertension must avoid decreasing CPP.	0.7147830216504769
In the early postrautmatic phase prevention of cerebral hypoxia relies on management of CBF by means of CPP and cerebral vascular resistance.	0.946377655047037
Thereafter targeted treatment of intracranial hypertension caused by cerebral edema and hypervolemia are increasingly important.	0.8563560889829592
Today, orthotopic liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for the end-stage of various liver diseases, and a 1-year survival rate of 80 % and a 5-year survival rate of 70 % in elective patients without tumor are reported in international surveys.	1.4000698217599021
The liver transplant programme of the Inselspital in Bern is small compared with international centres, which may raise questions about the results and the justification for such a programme.	1.1431493474199956
Over a period of 66 months, 62 liver transplantations were performed in 60 patients at the Inselspital.	1.0052814121057532
The hospital mortality was 3.3 %, and the 2.5-year overall survival rate was 92 % for elective cases without tumor.	1.4521880659831305
After a median follow-up of 30 months, 68 % of all patients were re-integrated in housework or full- or part-time in their profession, and 83 % were independent from the help of others.	1.2993847135993166
We conclude that a small liver transplant programme based only on routine resources can achieve results comparable to the international standards.	1.0263925234447564
Accidental hypothermia (AH) can be defined as an unintentional decrease in core temperature below 35  °C during cold exposure by individuals without intrinsic thermoregulatory dysfunction.	0.9322550931441218
Pathophysiological changes can be attributed both to the severity of hypothermia and to co-morbid factors such as trauma, submersion, intoxication and underlying diseases.	0.8850901815330263
In trauma victims stratified according to the Injury Severity Score, the factor hypothermia is considered to be a poor prognostic sign for survival.	1.0652692604795766
In these patients rewarming therapy should be applied as soon as possible.	0.9927653916707571
In the Utrecht University Hospital, adult patients with AH are managed according to an algorithm based on their presenting hemodynamic conditions.	0.9907319709422953
Patients with perfusing cardiac rhythms and systolic pressures over 80 mmHg will receive continuous arteriovenous rewarming (CAVR).	0.7754793766233367
Arrested and hemodynamically instable patients are treated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).	0.6490849679689435
In a 3-year period, 22 patients with AH were admitted to the emergency department.	1.0395970634616152
Fourteen patients had a trauma as the cause of hypothermia.	0.8863601657804966
Twenty patients were treated according to the algorithm (CAVR n = 18, CPB n = 2) and two patients were alternatively managed.	1.2402686422734464
Mortality in the CAVR group was 28 % and total mortality reached 32 %.	1.1890606606879117
Complications of CAVR are related to placement and removal of vascular catheters and may be severe in these patients with impaired coagulation.	1.0503030949606451
CAVR permits a good access to the (trauma-) patient and rewarming can be continued synchronously with diagnosis and treatment of various injuries.	1.268477870080819
The grading of long-tubular-bone pseudarthrosis depends on the biological reaction or lack of reaction in pseudarthrosis or non-unions.	0.9744880089483893
Hypertrophic and oligotrophic pseudarthrosis belongs to biologically reacting non-unions, whereas non-reacting non-unions are necrotic pseudarthrosis and defective non-unions with partial decline or complete destruction of cortical substance.	0.9653323287559824
Pseudarthrosis is a serious disturbance or disorder within the regulation cycle in fracture healing, which consists of osteoregeneration, osteovascularization and stabilization.	0.9429397134596673
The causes and underlying reasons for disturbance of this regulation cycle are primarily massive destruction of the biological and functional very important unity of periost, cortical substance and medullary space.	1.0037036504858743
This can occur from trauma, but it happens more often from surgical procedures that do not take the biological principles of bone-healing into account.	1.1487779518022305
Surgical strategies and interventions that respect the importance of periosteal tissue, cortical tissue and medullary space do fill the biological principles of fracture-healing and fracture union.	0.9545633288025234
Background: Clonidine, an 2-receptor agonist, has been reported to prolong the blocking actions of local anaesthetics.	1.436723004045582
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of spinally injected clonidine on the duration of spinal anaesthesia by mepivacaine and on the postoperative demand for analgesics.	0.9030460819010098
Differentiation of an elevated, repeatedly determined platelet count (>=500x109/l) includes the discrimination between reactive causes generated by a variety of underlying conditions and a neoplastic myeloprolifera-tive disorder (CMPD).	0.9567104087104814
In addition to clinical findings, the evolution of laboratory data during follow-up and histology of the bone marrow exerts a significant diagnostic impact.	1.201410598559635
Characteristic features are not only expressed by hematopoiesis, but also by the myeloid stromal compartment.	1.165667578606967
While the megakaryocyte-rich subtype of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and the 5q- syndrome (MDS) are dominated by abnormal micromegakaryocytes, in polycythemia vera (PV) this cell lineage reveals a pleomorphous appearance.	1.0110376398795986
In essential thrombocythemia (ET), a prevalence of giant megakaryocytes with deeply lobulated (staghorn-like) nuclei may be encountered.	0.9662420238494269
A clear-cut discrimination of ET from early (hypercellular) stages of idiopathic (primary) myelofibrosis (IMF) presenting with thrombocythemia becomes possible, provided the conspicuous atypical features of megakaryopoiesis characterizing the latter entity are taken into account.	0.9411383650812307
Moreover, CML displays a predominance of the granulocytic lineage whereas PV shows a panmyelosis or trilineage proliferation, involving erythropoiesis, in particular.	1.0962478551791486
In contrast, erythropoiesis is markedly reduced in CML and to a lesser degree also in IMF.	1.0374975386381056
In CMPDs extreme values of iron deposits may be found, ranging from a total lack (PV) to minor amounts (CML) and a normal staining reaction (ET).	1.1260708833354651
Similar results are exhibited regarding reticulin fibrosis, which is usually not present in ET, rarely observed in PV and detectable to a variable degree in CML and IMF.	1.0749175565694962
Nevus cell aggregates in lymph nodes are uncommon.	0.8295083350098913
This benign phenomenon may be difficult to differentiate from metastatic neoplasia.	0.7981583678464492
We report the case of a 56-year-old patient who underwent breast biopsy, followed by radical mastectomy including lymphadenectomy.	0.9985995091374545
Histological examination revealed solid cell aggregates as foreign tissue in the capsule of 1 of 11 identified lymph nodes devoid of any keratin immunoreaction.	0.9643999963690569
Strong immunohistological staining for the S-100 protein confirmed the diagnosis of nevus cell aggregates.	1.0541660083161868
We report the case of a seven year old girl presenting with varicella infection 14 days after kidney transplantation.	0.8795078096165426
Cramp-like abdominal pain and a subileus were the first symptoms.	1.0421340366706997
Enemas did not relieve the symptoms, and the following laparotomoy with Tenckhoff catheter explantation was performed which did not reveal any pathologic abnormalities.	1.0661377664712446
Two days after the beginning of abdominal pain an unspecific papular rash developed.	0.8244794256893603
Further twelve hours later skin vesicles appeared and varicella-zoster virus was isolated from their fluid.	0.7855395381157515
Despite high dose administration of aciclovir and varicella-zoster immune globulin further visceral dissemination occurred and finally lead to liver failure and intravascular coagulopathy.	0.8325632317509661
The patient died 18 days after kidney transplantation from multiorgan failure.	0.8752920153480512
The unconscious patient presents an challenging emergency in the intensive care unit.	0.5979149496112944
Patient evaluation and treatment must occur simultaneously.	0.7220931092960399
After checking vital signs, deciding about cardiopulmonary resuscitation or intubation, an intravenous line must be established, blood samples collected and glucose and thiamine should be given.	0.9960555292125811
The physical and neurological examination should be performed in a efficient way and must consider the following eight points: best reaction to loud commands, best motor reaction to noxious stimuli, respiratory pattern, size and reactions of pupils, eye movements, corneal and blink reflex, meningismus, muscle tone and deep tendon reflexes.	1.0071164066735325
With this approach it is possible to formulate a working diagnosis, and the appropriate diagnostic steps can be performed.	1.2884669948059058
A severe course of alcohol withdrawal has been observed in 28% of patients in a neurological intensive care unit due to complicating central nerve system (CNS) diseases.	1.295387669636172
In any atypical alcoholic delirium, especially with focal neurological signs, partial seizures, or decreased level of consciousness, CNS diseases like meningoencephalitis, intracranial hemorrhage, or central pontine myelinolysis must be diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) scan and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) tap.	1.0530471264498447
The diagnostic and prognostic value of CT scan and CSF analysis was examined in 32 persons with alcohol withdrawal syndrome or delirium tremens.	1.081264159568913
Neurological complications and cerebral convulsions at the beginning of delirium tremens appear to predispose the patient to a protracted clinical course and necessary mechanical ventilation.	1.0411278858340365
Blood-CSF barrier permeability is increased in 70% of alcohol withdrawal patients and that also seems to be a marker of a prolonged clinical course.	1.1701090348005672
Cerebral atrophy as shown in CT scan does not play a role in predicting clinical course.	0.9409793285074802
In our experience, CT examination or lumbar puncture is not necessarily recommended if clinical signs are typical for alcohol delirium.	0.9950605274166076
Recently, an implantable hearing aid for rehabilitation of sensorineural hearing loss has been developed.	0.979489468533786
One component of the device is the microphone for implantation into the posterior canal wall.	0.9506175657577454
The membrane of the microphone can be covered by skin, cartilage, or fascia, avoiding reduction in sound transmission at the same time.	1.0101513832627114
In the study presented here, the microphone was implanted into 50 cadaver specimens of human temporal bone.	1.1549087056928793
Localization of the microphone was determined by the anatomical situation of the facial nerve.	1.105895190899237
The microphone and the piezoelectric transducer could be implanted in 78% of the temporal bones after total mastoidectomy.	1.280523167495922
In the final version of the microphone, the size was 4.5 mm and total weight 400 mg.	1.2876229135891535
Collagen vascular diseases, representing systemic soft tissue disorders, may cause a broad spectrum of pathologic changes of the respiratory tract.	1.0795776733430926
The type and extent of manifestations can vary considerably among individuals and entities.	0.7879871881876233
This survey describes the chest radiographic and, in particular, high-resolution computed tomographic (HRCT) findings of individual lesions of the respiratory tract.	1.1181576470892605
It includes fibrosing alveolitis (alveolitis, interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis) and bronchial (bronchitis/bronchiolitis, bronchiectasis), pleural and vascular manifestations, as well as lymphadenopathy and abnormalities related to therapy.	1.0460114394778404
We present typical patterns of changes in progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS, scleroderma), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD, Sharp syndrome), Sjögren syndrome, overlap syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).	1.019118427441156
Furthermore, we describe findings which are specific for individual entities such as esophageal involvement in PSS, acute pneumonitis and pulmonary hemorrhage in SLE, lymphoproliferative disease in Sjögren syndrome and necrobiotic nodules in RA.	1.042346566680618
The psychodynamics of patients with severe personality disorders, eating disorders, or "hysterical" symptoms are increasingly understood as ways of coping with traumatic experiences in childhood or adolescence such as abuse or violence.	1.01762732657673
Dissociation with induced depersonalisation, derealisation, and personification of objects as only good or only bad is the central coping mechanism during and after a traumatic experience.	1.0035543578646742
Unassimilated memories of traumata have a retraumatizing effect and call for defence through eating disorders, substance abuse, self-harming behaviour, or social acting-out.	0.8364828572514653
Against this psychodynamic background we describe a method of trauma-therapy which uses experiences of hypnotherapy and of Guided affective Imagery.	0.9697392822233966
In the preparatory phase a secure inner space and contact to inner helpers are established in the imagination using a resource-oriented approach.	0.8488678221471495
The actual trauma-therapy consists of a gradual leading-up to the traumatic scenes through consistent, minimally retraumatizing confrontation, followed by consolation and the ability to let go.	1.0463771672687123
In the final phase there is a return to resource-oriented creativity and concrete life planning.	0.9478387115339734
All patients of the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the Erfurt Hospital with odontogenic pyogenic infections have been analyzed in a retrospective study over a period of 10 years, from 1987 to 1997.	1.0554919289895262
This included questions concerning frequency, seriousness and treatment of these infections, social changes in the environ prove effects about the referral behaviour and the course.	1.0863801406523168
Odontogenic pyogenic infections are mixed infections.	0.6426757054016535
Aerobic agents such as hemolytic streptococcuses and staphylococcuses as well as anaerobic bacteria and  fungi can be involved.	0.799673806935122
Cephalosporine, aminobenzylpenicillin in combination with -lactamase inhibitor, alcylaminopenicillin and lincosamide are recommended based on analysis of infection resistance as first choice medications with carbapeneme as a reserve antibiotic.	0.8944251947774647
Hospitals are competing with each other for the limited financial resources available in the health care sector.	0.8410493207303068
Comparison of hospitals is legally required (BPflV § 5) to improve financial efficiency in the health care sector and make competition between hospitals keener, while also objectivizing it.	1.0647888589533239
If comparison of the hospitals is really to enhance profitability or efficiency, and not just to reduce the prices for hospital stays regardless of quality, it must extend to far more than the global figures in the compilation summarizing performance and calculation and the hospital statistics (no.	1.1674913299697485
of cases, days of care, length of stay, case lump sums and special fees).	0.8785163947274465
Documentation of particular features of the patient population, the potentials of the hospital and description of the treatment processes yield valuable information on capacity and performance level.	1.2797526504035766
With rising costs, the danger is growing that the quality and risk dimension of the actual medical treatment will not be promoted with the same enthusiasm by those offering the service.	1.1235413312108062
Hospital audit does not only allow a check on the hospital's own situation with regard to performance, quality, efficiency and patient satisfaction, but can also provide a basis for structural planning.	1.0454262619759975
The fact is that all efforts made and steps taken by the responsible persons in the hospital to improve the quality of structures, processes and results can only be successful if they are also perceived by the patients, the doctors who refer them and the visitors.	1.0846522090248396
If hospital audit is restricted to the bed occupancy and the invoicing data, it is only realistic to expect cuts in performance level.	0.9791306577799398
This would be bad for the patient and, in view of the consequent costs, also for the overall costs in the health care sector.	1.1494741701594333
Against the backdrop of a future performance-related system of remuneration instead of the principle of covering one's own costs that has been in place hitherto, openness about treatment results gains in importance as a competition parameter for qualified hospitals.	0.9836560252430389
Laparoscopic pelvic lymph node dissection was performed in 120 patients scheduled to undergo either radical perineal prostatectomy or radiation therapy.	0.9312800200575544
On average 13 lymph nodes were resected in each patient, and 21 patients were found to have metastatic disease in 1-9 lymph nodes.	1.1418004701348037
After an initial learning curve, mean operative time was reduced significantly, allowing laparoscopic lymph node dissection and radical prostatectomy to be performed as a one-stage procedure.	1.2435665155256377
The overall complication rate was 10 %; open revisions were necessary in only 2 of 120 patients.	1.0703562253950247
Postoperative hospital stay was 2 days in patients undergoing laparoscopic lymph node dissection only.	1.0713256525776738
This minimally invasive procedure is particularly beneficial to patients with lymph node metastases not undergoing radical prostatectomy, as well as to patients planned to be treated by radiation therapy.	1.1025968937199102
The combination of laparoscopic lymph node dissection and radical perineal prostatectomy avoids an abdominal incision and thus shortens both the hospital stay and the period of convalescence.	1.0247654843144876
Taking the concepts of psychic structure and internal representation as an example, three different ways of relating psychoanalytic concepts to neurobiology are presented and discussed: the localizing, the metaphorical and the modelling relation.	1.201263056995137
The need is stressed not to mix up the different levels of description and explanation too early; at the same time it is argued that - after the dismissal of the old metapsychology - this way of relating offers a new chance to integrate neurobiological aspects in the concept of psychic structure without falling into the traps of biologistic reductionism and individualism.	1.0392902947410514
Following augmentation of the upper extremity muscles necessitated by damage to the brachial plexus, special post-operative care programs are required to provide the patient with the best possible results.	1.222774485519116
Proper care requires cooperation between the orthopedic surgeon, physical therapists and nurses.	0.8748012726944325
Only then can postoperative rehabilitation and functional control of the extremity improve.	0.9081349166294176
We describe interdisciplinary postoperative care programs for augmentation of the deltoid muscle with trapezius transfer, arthrodesis of the glenohumeral joint, biceps augmentation with the latissimus dorsi transfer, Steindler flexorplasty and augmentation of flexors/extensors muscles in the hand.	0.8517983489387014
The prevalence of type I allergy against latex was investigated in dental students by questionnaire, prick tests and the determination of specific IgE antibodies.	0.9148810762365427
Positive prick tests against different latex fluids were found in 18 (8.7%) of 206 students, with clinical relevance in 11 cases.	1.2464260383837116
When the total number of students in each semester was taken into account an increase in the minimal prevalence of clinically relevant latex allergy from 2% in the second semester to 10.4% in the tenth semester was seen.	1.3044528859713882
A history of glove intolerance presenting as a wheal-and-flare reaction was associated with a type I allergy against latex in only 50% of the affected subjects.	1.0749217724393252
Atopic diseases and hand eczema of different causes proved to be risk factors in 16 and 5 of 18 students with latex allergy, respectively.	0.9768384427894987
A high-ammonia accelerator-free latex fluid proved to be a very reliable test medium compared to the less sensitive determination of specific IgE antibodies to latex.	1.0637982951985354
Gastrointestinal obstruction is a frequently observed emergency with tumor patients.	0.8548781995266702
In addition to tumor relapse, the development of a second tumor or intraperitoneal tumor spreading, and benign alterations in advanced tumor stages (radiogenic stenosis, adhesions) may also be the cause for the obstruction.	1.2081188288531148
The main objective of therapy is an attempt to eliminate the intestinal obstruction through surgery.	1.0592175053834414
If this is not possible because of advanced intra-abdominal tumor expansion, several endoscopic or interventional radiology methods, and drugs are available, that are used on an individual basis and based on prevailing experience to relieve the patient's condition.	1.2027131248357934
The case of a 60-year-old female patient with a supraglottic larynx carcinoma (T3N2CM0) and bilateral enlargement of the laryngeal sacculus is presented.	1.1807122911873345
On one side, the sacculus opened atypically into the left vestibular fold.	0.822321693038477
The sacculus is a physiologic part of the roof of Morgagni's ventricle, the size of which can vary greatly.	1.003577737664347
These canal-like structures can be the point of origin of cysts, laryngoceles, mucoceles, and pyoceles.	0.9310042449998815
Adverse effects of resuscitation due to closed-chest cardiac massage are common, and the incidence is increased when an incorrect technique is used.	1.2203841610268953
Nevertheless, thrombolytic therapy of a myocardial infarction can become necessary even after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).	1.040156169825686
In these patients, the risk of thrombolytic therapy-induced bleeding is immanent.	0.9294910614992496
Implantable cardioverter/defibrillators (ICD) have led to a reduction in cardiac mortality in patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias.	1.0257736220288614
A considerable number of patients experience repeated shocks which may have an impact on the quality of life.	0.886538458662314
An overview of the 30 years history and developement of documentation and information systems in the Orthopedic University Hospital Heidelberg is presented.	1.0075221251593984
Since the foundation in 1967 four developmental phases can be described: first initiatives of medical doctors, establishment of a basic documentation system for scientific purposes, strategic information system planning and realisation of information systems with the possibility of controlling in medical areas and thereby steering of the services.	1.0106487375873177
Planning and realisation were accomplished within the framework of the masterplans and concepts of the university clinics of the state of Baden-Württemberg.	1.0112971792474554
The treatment success of nCPAP therapy (nasal continuous positive airway pressure) depends partly on the relief of symptoms and partly on long-term patient acceptance and the related avoidance of complications.Nasal complaints constitute the most frequently reported side effects and, together with problems of mask application, are among the primary factors causing an nCPAP-therapy to be prematurely discontinued.	1.087947041736517
The foramen ovale is anatomically open in 25 % of individuals, but functionally closed by the higher pressure in the left antrum.	1.2366290187899178
Right-to-left shunt and subsequent paradoxical embolism may occur when pressure in the left antrum rises, for example, as a result of pulmonary embolism.	1.1359740012007709
In the present case we demonstrate a patient who presented 20 days after osteosynthetic treatment of a femoral fracture with word-finding deficits.	1.1879046576321324
Cerebral MRT revealed a fresh ischemic insult.	0.6479320108964793
Duplex ultrasound of the legs showed a fresh thrombosis of the superficial femoral vein and scintigraphy of the lungs detected pulmonary embolism.	1.075400116878906
Transesophageal contrast echocardiography trapped a hemodynamically spontaneous, open foramen ovale.	0.832503030127494
Duplex ultrasound of the carotid arteries detected no pathological findings.	0.9049518239647765
Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism can be clinically unconspicuous and become manifest by cerebral deficits resulting from paradox embolism and cerebral ischemia.	0.8108713225852364
The diagnostic strategies in multiple trauma aim at rapid identification of life-threatening injuries, recognition of serious organ lesions, and evaluation of the systemic trauma impact, as well as the resulting host reaction.	1.0610549809320067
Besides improvements in the structure and organization, major innovations in imaging techniques have significantly improved and accelerated evaluation of the patient with multiple injuries in the emergency room.	1.2981237829234455
Systematic diagnostic work-up, integrated multidisciplinary approach, and defined algorithms for traumatic key symptoms represent the hallmarks of successful emergency room management.	0.9763799932873026
In particular, diagnostic work-up of injured body cavities using sonography and helical computed tomography are evaluated.	1.201324231147859
Pheochromocytomas are functionally active, catecholamine-secreting tumours of chromaffin tissue.	0.7469940322439333
The mainstay of pharmacological therapy is preoperative treatment with oral phenoxybenzamine.	0.917771001901673
This drug irreversibly alkylates alpha-1-adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle and renders them nonfunctional, thereby causing vasodilatation.	0.9320155817832196
The duration of action of a single dose is approximately 24 h. Therefore, postoperative hypotension is a hazard of therapy with phenoxybenzamine if adequate plasma volume repletion is not provided.	1.178737311917277
Prazosin, a short-acting, competitive alpha-1 blocker, has been used preoperatively, but has been criticized for its failure to adequately prevent perioperative hypertensive episodes.	1.2403626689598513
Case report: Case presentation of a 59-year old female patient, who has been treated for her cancer by a physician of internal medicine with peroxodisulphuric acid.	1.0362069957644098
For this therapy to be successful - according to the physician - all drugs especially the analgetics had to be stopped.	1.2638067985287456
We present a case of primary plasmocytoma of the left upper bronchus.	1.1454240966004359
Occlusion led to atelectasis of the left upper lobe and subsequent poststenotic pneumonia.	0.9039297394251021
Therapy consisted of local excision of the bronchus and postoperative radiotherapy.	0.9932494736424223
This type of lung-conserving therapy in a case of primary plasmocytoma has not been described before.	1.0901228745644276
545 male patients with a tentative diagnosis "urethritis" were examined between November 1984 and December 1994 in the Department of Dermatology and Venerology of the Military Hospital in Ulm.	1.124142224500268
The patients, aged from 18 to 58 years (mean age 24.1 years), were examined according to a standardized diagnostic procedure: ...	1.3317390040355763
The use of the Kaufman-Assessment Battery for Children (K-ABC) was evaluated with a sample of 50 mentally disabled adults in a wide age range, as there exist no special tests for this group of patients.	1.158013860757364
Intercorrelation- and factor analyses, and correlations with the German adaptation of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (HAWIE-R) proved the use of the K-ABC to be valid.	1.1158484136674058
As an assessment battery for children designed for the wide age range from 2-6 to 12-5 years is more adequate to the capability of intellectually impaired adults, the K-ABC delivers results on individual strengths and weaknesses, based on a neuropsychological theory.	1.0517662805673493
Thus the individual cognitive abilities can be assessed with more differentiation, and that gives an important base for intervention, partial remediation, and placement.	1.1855383007913554
Subject: Using multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) large body areas can scanned with high spatial resolution.	0.9020701736565443
In this study, MSCT was employed for virtual colonoscopy in various pathologies of the colon.	0.8500062701422468
In a regional quality assurance project for screening mammography (German Mammography Study), 27 335 women were screened in 40 participating, office-based mammography units from 1990-1992.	0.9964344641606838
Screening led to 317 biopsies with a positive predictive value of 0.33.	0.9099268039973362
All biopsy documentation available to the mammography physicians was analysed with a view towards biopsy interval and completeness of information fed back to the Mx physicians.	0.9263723467168641
Biopsy recommendations were acted upon in 29 % of cases within 2 weeks.	1.0683899512196047
With the exception of the dignity Mx physicians were incompletely informed about biopsy results.	0.7617431082746435
The surgical procedure was known in the doctors' offices in 62 % of the cases.	1.060301775489672
Specimen radiographies were not done regularly.	0.6199016203673199
A pathology report was available overall in 42 of 106 malignant cases, respectively.	0.753465354094469
With the exception of the histological diagnosis itself, no variable mentioned in the reports was documented completely.	1.1049393164435326
Only one third of the physicians received such reports routinely.	0.9773343127447673
Fail-safe information are requested by Mx physicians and can help them to better target biopsy recommendations.	0.8351759935436501
A (regional) quality assurance center should be made responsible to analyse the flow of information in mammography screening, to fill in gaps and to speed up professional cooperation.	1.0478612263536031
The high rate of recurrence after the treatment of adhesive obstruction demands special prophylactic treatment.	1.050482952840193
In a 13-year period, 52 out of 95 patients with major adhesions were provided with a long nasointestinal tube for intestinal splinting intraoperatively.	0.9987735641090884
The was being left in situ on an average of 6.6 days.	1.0370684444569513
After an observation period of at least 36 months a recurrence was seen in 2 of these 52 patients (3.9 %; causes: volvulus after 6 months/fibrinous peritonitis on the 6th postoperative day).	1.1218626184085023
Amongst the 43 'non-splinted' patients, recurrence of adhesive obstruction was documented in 8 cases (18.6 %; causes: adhesions after 0.3-136.9 months).	1.0331171447508796
In the course of aftercare abdominal complaints were significantly fewer in patients who had been splinted.	0.9428249130366841
Complications concerning the nasointestinal tubes did not occur.	0.5527384207869699
The rate of perioperative complications was similar in both groups.	0.8204819408673845
Minimally invasive cardiac surgery has been developed to offer patients the benefits of open heart operations with decreased pain and limited skin incision.	1.1151625603978668
In this study, we report the results of minimally AVR compared to the conventional method performed in the same period.	1.3470493695809216
From May 1996 to January 1998, 86 patients received isolated aortic valve replacement by the limited superior median sternotomy (group 1).	0.9564481144738747
As a control group (group 2), 78 patients were enrolled who underwent isolated aortic valve replacements by standard sternotomy in the same period.	1.0006537321755606
AV-synchrony and rate-responsive pacing are known as major factors to increase the maximum working capacity in patients with chronotropic incompetence.	0.8954647101585829
However, their importance throughout low-levels of exercise is poorly evaluated.	1.2032062412062172
We studied 11 patients with implanted dual-chamber pacemakers (Telectronics, META 1254) concerning oxygen uptake kinetics during serial treadmill exercise testing at a constant workload of 35 W (LITE protocol).	0.9265483087004581
Each patient was tested in VVIR-, DDD-, and DDDR-mode.	1.216214917689337
All AV delays were constant at 160ms.	0.602248099517884
The oxygen deficit (O2D), mean response time (MRT) for oxygen uptake, and a oxygen deficit index (O2Di) were determined.	1.3393226937182976
In addition, the heart rate (HR) and bloodpressure were monitored.	0.8694340216937323
Results: Significant differences (p<0.01) were observed in HR and O2D when comparing both DDD- to VVIR- and DDD- to DDDR-modes.	1.22781320640459
Comparing the randomly synchronous VVIR- to the DDDR-mode, only the MRT of oxygen uptake demonstrated a significant decrease in the DDDR-mode (p<0.05).	0.9369885151540718
There were also significant decreases in O2Di and MRT in the DDDR-mode, as compared to the non-rate responsive DDD-mode (p<0.01).	0.8005075414696425
Stress testing in PM patients with an appropriate chronotropic response to low intensity exercise demontrates that AV synchrony is of much less influence on oxygen uptake kinetics than the rate-adaptive pacing.	0.9907447926071102
Purpose: This paper discusses the role of different imaging modalities in the diagnostic work-up of Crohn's disease (CD).	1.195564717994604
Introduction: Results of animal experiments have demonstrated that the osseous integration of non-cemented prostheses can, at the very least temporarily, be impaired by the application of non-steroidal antiphlogistic agents (such as diclofenac).	1.11451456355614
It is the objective of this study to examine whether there is a direct influence of diclofenac used in usual clinical dosages (3 times 50 mg daily) on bone cells and their progenitor cells which would explain the observed slow integration of the prostheses.	1.2909701256822033
Methods: To investigate this, cultivated human in vitro osteoblasts and stromal bone marrow cells were incubated with increasing doses of the medications.	1.1760858197752475
Our study focused on the effect of diclofenac application on proliferation and functional metabolism in both cell lines.	0.7278144440433822
The measurable maximal plasma concentration 2h after the application of one tablet Voltaren 50 reached 1.6µg/ml.	0.7649391908538451
This correlated with diclofenac concentrations between 1 and 10 ml found in our experiments.	0.935404512883283
The detected values were correlated to the control group (0 µg/ml diclofenac).	0.9565353989106091
Results: The drug effect upon osteoblasts was higher than on progenitor cells.	0.9842062116138351
The proliferation of in vitro stromal bone marrow cells, compared to untreated cells, was found to be decreased.	1.0955821090604372
We observed a decrease to 82% at a diclofenac concentration of 1 µg/ml, Osteoblasts exhibited a decrease to 97,5% at the same concentration.	1.2904225755477317
The DNA synthesis increased to 118% in stromal bone marrow cells, in osteoblasts to 144%.	0.962649535189875
In contrast, we detected a neglectible decrease to 92% in the collagen synthesis of osteoblasts compared to untreated cells.	1.2704809159943409
The synthesis of osteocalcin by osteoblasts increased to 119%.	0.7064857166972232
The alkaline phosphatase activity was found to be decreased to 88% in stromal bone marrow cells and increased in osteoblasts to 111%.	1.0266870278066031
Conclusion: Temporary inhibiting effects on osseous integration in non-cemented prosthesis by diclofenac could be caused by a disturbance in the anabolic bone metabolism, exhibited by an increase of osteoblastic osteocalcin expression.	1.0692066424662778
Osteocalcin as a known negative regulator of the osteoneogenesis is most likely inhibiting the collagen matrix deposition.	0.8740957805049229
Recent investigations have controversially but convincingly interpreted the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (arteriosclerosis).	0.9375102566407366
Atherosclerosis can apparently be the result of ultrachronic, persistent infection by Chlamydia pneumoniae and not the result of heterogenous risk factors.	0.9787013876438716
The main arguments for chlamydial genesis are: Correlation of coronary heart disease and other atherosclerotic diseases and antibodies against Chlamydia pneumoniae.	0.8490106808784178
(2) Chlamydia pneumoniae could be detected with different techniques (PCR, ICC, immunhistology, electromicroscopy, culture) in a high percentage of atheromas from different sites.	1.1681264209529132
(3) According to three successful international studies with macrolides in coronary heart disease.	0.8072610105348459
(4) Target cells of atherosclerosis (endothelia, macrophages, muscle cells) can be infected by Chlamydia pneumoniae in vitro.	0.8985289109739802
(5) Provocation of arteriitis in animal experiments.	0.6216714282700341
(6) The reduction of incidence of atherosclerotic diseases since the 1960s, probably due to advances in antibiotic treatment.	0.9851171565310395
(7) Elevated levels of acute-phase proteins and other inflammatory signs (CRP, WBC count, fibrinogin) briefly before cardiac infarction occurs.	0.9397284912438499
There are good arguments for intervention studies in coronary heart disease and other manifestations of atherosclerosis.	0.9213763428522582
The relevant antibiotics are available for chlamydial infections and are inexpensive and safe.	0.8779210385260354
Meticulous protocols and long-term monitoring of patients should be developed.	0.8855268304187085
The pre- and postoperative symptoms of zygomatic bone fractures were examined in a follow-up study to prepare a classification proposal.	1.193533379815136
A differential indication for minimally invasive therapy modes was looked for with respect to this proposal.	0.8168192367448847
Therapy of isolated zygomatic bone fractures consisted in repositioning with a hook and miniplate fixation across the frontozygomatic suture.	0.7671326170731841
The aims of this study were clinical and radiological assessment of the repositioning result in terms of aesthetics and stability and quantification of the postoperative remission of disturbances of sensitivity of the infraorbital nerve.	1.0809292255645855
A total of 52 patients were examined.	1.0045678826949458
After the operation (on average after 3.5 days following the trauma) they were followed-up postoperatively for 12 months according to a strict schedule.	1.2386230948122825
Preoperatively, 49 patients reported disturbances of sensitivity of the infraorbital nerve.	0.7001536628333348
Other symptoms, such as periorbital haematoma and flattening of the zygomatic prominence, were observed in 49 patients and 45 patients, respectively.	1.052759903740667
All fractures were repositioned well as assessed clinically and radiologically.	0.8481445360245181
The aesthetic result was evaluated as symmetric and durable in all cases.	0.8505332495550182
Six months postoperatively 41 patients reported normal sensitivity in the area of the infraorbital nerve.	0.763893405920179
In only five patients (10.2%) was the sensitivity loss persistent throughout the entire follow-up period.	1.264012885644002
Patients with primarily lacking diplopia developed neither eye motility disturbances nor postoperative enophthalmus in the following period.	0.8675904888281836
It can be concluded that the treatment of an isolated zygomatic bone fracture which satisfies aesthetic and functional requirements is possible by reposition and fixation with one miniplate at the lateral orbital rim.	1.0688333148368403
An additional osteosynthesis at the infraorbital rim or at the zygomaticomaxillary crista is not necessary.	0.8063527167558981
A routine revision of the orbital floor is only indicated in cases of preoperative diplopia.	0.897656030187589
A zygomatic bone fracture connected with diplopia should be classified as combined zygomatic-/orbital floor fracture.	0.9094636380578137
Chronic primary headache has a considerable impact on the quality of life.	0.7134763668156061
To date, this impact has been evaluated by measurements of the general pain specific impairment of the quality of life.	1.0268953746445264
Headache specific measurements of quality of life or of disability caused by the headache are still missing for the German language.	1.1673245697818462
In America, a headache specific questionnaire, the "Headache Disability Inventory" (HDI), has been evaluated which is used in the presented study to create a German version, the "Inventar zur Beeinträchtigung durch Kopfschmerzen" (IBK).	1.269556710245845
94 consecutive patients with a primary headache disorder (59 female, 35 male; mean age 40 +/- 12 years) were examined.	1.2228942863348222
Cronbach's alpha was a=0.90, the test-retest-reliability after three months was r=0.87.	0.8665585385113258
An analysis of subscales for emotional and functional disability showed similar values for the internal consistency and the test-retest-reliability of these subscales.	0.8666500376667704
The scores of the different headache types did not differ significantly.	1.1218840387033444
In post-hoc-analyses, however, cluster headache showed higher disability scores than migraine both in the total scale and in the subscales.	1.0718996711664575
The total score of the IBK was significantly correlated with the number of headache days per month (r=0.41; p<0.0003) but not with the duration of disease or other demographic parameters.	1.075546307125658
The IBK is the first German headache specific measurement of certain aspects of the quality of life in chronic headache patients.	1.133897716289522
It can be used in clinical settings to evaluate the current state of the patient or to monitor treatment and it can be used for scientific studies.	1.4698819354693586
Age and menstrual cycle have an important influence on the breast.	0.7854430742836921
This well-known fact is experienced in the daily routine of gynecologists and radiologists.	0.9419897981153165
The number of publications addressing the effect of these influences on imaging, however, is surprisingly low.	1.0759618646367772
The aim of this work is to describe the influences of age and menstrual cycle on the breast and to address their clinical relevance for mammography and MR mammography.	1.1680799067623662
Therefore, own data are presented concerning the age and menstrual cycle influences on breast parenchyma in dynamic MR mammography.	1.1299037196190829
Literature data are used to correlate mammography and MR imaging findings with these influences.	1.0044816563211056
The changes of the breast due to age and menstrual cycle have important direct implications on performing and reading conventional mammography and MR mammography.	0.9109083968682528
The knowledge of these changes is also helpful in the interpretation of findings when comparing different methods.	0.9171534873952145
Finally, the data gained by using imaging methods enable important basic insights into physiology and physiopathology of the breast in vivo.	1.1305935508074654
As part of our neonatal screening program we applied tandem mass spectrometry on 128.225 dried blood samples for detection of inborn errors of metabolism.	0.8255459290947968
Appendectomy is one of the most frequent surgical procedures.	0.9090324319476875
Accuracy in the clinical diagnosis of acute non-specific appendicitis, however, suffers from the fact that the symptoms and clinical findings of acute appendicitis can be mimicked by many other abdominal diseases.	1.2837872334069467
The clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis, therefore, can only be definitely confirmed by pathomorphological analysis, the criteria of which are reviewed in this paper.	1.187305301562493
Special emphasis is given to distinct variants of acute appendicitis and the significance of neuroappendicopathy.	0.9547550435768728
Extra-articular interventions by osteotomies to correct the axial malpositioning of the joint (genu varum or valgum) are treatments proven over many years.	1.0043045349542086
The middle and long term results shows many patients are very satisfied.	1.0750274275159835
Unfortunately a uniform critical examination is lacking because the investigators used no scores.	0.8063844414429956
The good results by infra- and supracondylar osteotomies - some of them for 15 years and more - have to be achieved by prosthesis first.	1.2295798140743424
The important facts for gonarthrosis of the knee joint are the axial malpositioning, the miss load, and the instability of the joint; these facts are the cause for the complaints and for the restriction of functional efficiency.	1.2202531396878271
Therefore, indication of infra- or supracondylar osteotomies is not limited by the age of the patient.	1.2045393815178096
The most important fact is the condition of the joint, especially the quality of bone, the instability of the joint, and the loss of bone.	1.2730674408515459
Given the right indication, the treatment of genu varum and valgum by osteotomies is an important factor in preserving the joint.	0.9534409314790825
Also, there are still chances to do another operation, such a prothesis.	1.3335482735766566
A prothesis can be implanted if the osteotomy has no chance to preserve the joint.	0.8901807131005778
Psychic trauma may be followed by a variety of unpredictable reactions by the subject, which differ individually and are dependant upon the situation.	0.9657836851162137
Differentiation between psychic crises and psychiatric emergency situations (PES) is often difficult as the first might proceed into the second and definitions of the two tend to blur.	1.180056449010498
This article aims to overview the different psychic and psychiatric disturbances which are relevant in preclinical emergency medicine.	0.8670231492947229
A definition is offered to outline PES that require immediate medical intervention and crises due to psycho-social reasons.	0.7665690041287968
For the most important disturbances and syndromes the differential diagnostic procedures and therapeutic strategies are presented.	1.1782992446021023
Acute pancreatitis is a multietiologic entity with rather diverse clinical courses.	0.7520271942086362
Whereas edematous pancreatitis has a mortality of less than 1%, nowadays; still approximately 20% of all patients with the necrotizing form succumb to the disease.	1.2622262609650796
To further improve therapeutic results a standardized approach should be used.	0.8880823726737251
For effective treatment the differentiation between edematous and necrotizing pancreatitis is crucial.	0.8841794219372401
All patients with signs of pancreatic necroses during abdominal ultrasound and patients with organ insufficiencies should undergo a CT-scan to define exactly the nature and the extent of the disease.	1.02491427674333
Primarily all patients are treated conservatively.	1.0431714656853166
Main indications for operative intervention are signs for infection of pancreatic necroses and an acute abdomen due to local complications of acute pancreatitis.	1.1570620282557076
In cases of biliary origin an elective cholecystectomy has to be performed during a free interval to prevent a recurrence.	1.0979071888504657
Objective: Diagnosis of osteomyelitis is difficult in early state of disease.	1.1491797784305633
Usually, characteristic X-ray findings cannot be obtained during the first week of disease.	1.3142489219722646
Sonography, scintigraphy and magnetic resonance tomography were compared at clinical manifestation of osteomyelitis.	0.969240896416235
A 73-year old female patient is known to have hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) since 1989.	1.139895261729026
After a transmural anterolateral myocardial infarction with the development of a large apical aneurysma of the anterior wall, a previously measured gradient of 11 mm Hg in the LVOT is no longer detected.	1.1281965530320976
As a consequence of this casuistry, "pseudo-myectomy" caused by myocardial as an example of an uncommon spontaneous course of HOCM.	1.1451886790961536
Aim: Intensified insulin therapy is the therapy of choice for patients with diabetes Type I.	1.1362325055379527
Intensified insulin therapy includes an basis-bolus insulin injection regimen or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, several times daily blood glucose self-monitoring, self-adaptation of insulin dosages by the patients themselves and a far-reaching liberalization of nutrition.	0.9566239058688554
The patients learn selfmanagement of diabetes therapy in a structured treatment and teaching program.	0.8888949136590371
The effectivity of this program is evaluated in the routine care.	1.0452661109450412
The treatment of idiopathic scoliosis over 40  ° (Cobb) during the growth period is under discussion concerning the indication for conservative or surgical treatment.	1.038950386174778
Curve progression depends on the degree of the frontal and sagittal deformity, vertebral rotation, rigidity of the curve, the skeletal age, the age and sex of the patient, the familial frequency of scoliosis and the location of the curve.	1.1550144937929507
In scoliosis over 40  ° progression is fast and the possibilities for successful conservative brace treatment are reduced during the growth period.	0.9089190004534493
Progression occurs more frequently in thoracic and double major scolioses, especially in young patients (Risser sign 0 and 1).	1.160371537239689
The purpose of this study was to evaluate low-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with an open system and to correlate results obtained with the experience of the radiologist.	1.2051329662292183
Between August 1995 and May 1997, 75 patients at the Unfallchirurgische Universitätsklinik, Mainz, Germany, with an acute trauma of the knee joint were operated on arthroscopically after clinical examination, X-ray and MRI imaging.	1.1770266363928188
MRI analysis was performed by two independent radiologists with varying MRI experience without knowledge of the patient's history.	1.0942414704971706
The sensitivity and specifity of the more [U1] and the less experienced [U2] radiologist ranged from 83 to 100% (U1) and from 61 to 100% (U2).	1.1314040681081914
Positive and negative predictive value ranged from 83 to 100% (U1) and from 58 to 100% (U2); accuracy ranged from 92 to 100% (U1) and from 77 to 100% (U1).	1.0366427263907099
We conclude that the results of low-field MRI are comparable with those of high-field MRI and that differences in the results of the experienced and less experienced radiologist can be established.	1.3009345524751943
In intervention trials it was without exception possible to influence the development of atherosclerosis by a reduction of the LDL-cholesterol and an increase in HDL-cholesterol and to reduce complications like myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, angina or heart failure.	0.9921545629982725
Changes of lifestyle can be effective, but are rarely accepted and are difficult to communicate.	1.0234044749400082
Dermatosurgery has been gaining in importance in recent years.	0.736954205514083
In departments of dermatology German-speaking countries the total number of operations increased by 58% from 1984 to 1991.	1.029469298815637
The increase in the number of operations of moderate and extreme severity was especially marked.	0.8370813764038549
Out-patient dermatosurgery was also performed mainly by dermatologists as opposed to other specialties.	0.825329254272524
From 1988 to 1992 dermatologists in private practice recorded an increase of 40.6% in the number of operative procedures they performed.	1.0341819722037249
The importance of dermatosurgery in hospital and private practice can be expected to continue increasing in the future; dermatologists must therefore prepare themselves for the present and future challenges inherent in surgery of the skin.	1.0796195132122097
There is evidence that diastolic function is a major determinant of overall cardiac performance.	0.9472383238703636
Intraoperative use of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) enables Doppler measurement of mitral inflow pattern (E/A ratio).	0.9832611052256238
The E/A ratio is suggested to be a reliable index of changes in myocardial relaxation.	1.032078114647276
In the present study we compared the time course of the E/A ratio and the time constant of myocardial relaxation () assessed by direct left ventricular pressure recordings in patients before and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).	1.1890386818648988
After ethical approval, 12 patients undergoing CABG surgery were studied.	0.9653832395719222
Measurements of the E/A ratio and  were performed after induction of anesthesia (I), immediately prior to CPB with the pericardium open (II), 5 min after CPB (III), and after sternal closure (IV).	1.1511658445034747
Time constant of myocardial relaxation was calculated as the reciprocal value of the slope of the left ventricular dP/dt and left ventricular pressure plot.	1.0332353786507384
The E/A ratio was significantly decreased at the end of surgery (IV).	0.8061717695129826
In contrast,  was increased immediately after CPB, but decreased after sternal closure (IV).	1.0090361728735282
Cardiac index and heart rate both increased after CPB.	0.815429659889355
The results of the present study demonstrate that diastolic dysfunction occurred immediately after CPB, as indicated by an increase in the time constant of myocardial relaxation.	1.1639326061746655
However,  improved rapidly to pre-CPB values.	1.4714609644623777
The E/A ratio alone failed to detect the initial post-CPB alteration in left ventricular relaxation.	0.8867114578929461
Acute exercise is followed by a mobilization of white blood cells, mainly induced by increased levels of catecholamines and cortisol.	0.9750927826871668
NK-cells react the most intensive, they can increase fivefold after intensive exercise.	1.0025287547166293
Additionally a weak acute-phase reaction occurs.	0.7169251883066812
Most of these changes normalize during twenty-four hours.	1.0856343926951624
Parameters of the humoral immune system may be different from the pre-exercise levels up to seventy-two hours.	0.9665654918751077
Repeated physical exercise, which is typical for sports, is followed only by small changes of immunologic parameters under conditions of rest.	1.175370877323843
Epidemiological studies give clues that the rate of upper respiratory tract infections in athletes can be described by a j-shaped curve.	1.0063318657683438
Moderately active subjects have the lowest rate of infection.	0.8229943294692422
For this influence of exercise on health mainly functional changes seem to be important.	0.9188001922589801
Especially after exccentric exercise immunological cells can be seen in the muscle tissue, which remove destructed tissue.	0.9704873947056125
Not very much is known about the role of the immune system in the regeneration of tendons and other bradytrophic tissues.	0.986774029843324
To achieve septoplasty without compromising the surgical goal of attaining a straight and solid septum, even in cases of marked deviations or severe post-traumatic deformities, we now use a new technique in which the septal reconstruction includes the placement of a resorbable implant as a "compound graft".	1.1121383526398942
For this purpose the entire septal cartilage is removed, and the severely deviated part is divided into straight sections that are reconnected to each other to form a straight and solid plate.	1.0942846674081899
As connecting material we use a polydioxanon (PDS) foil.	0.6933592706692464
The sections of cartilage are sutured to the foil with PDS suture material.	0.754364981590778
The compound graft thus constructed consists of the septal cartilage and resorbable alloplastic material and is reimplanted into the nose.	0.8743557442339296
The PDS and suture material are usually resorbed within 8 months, excluding long-term complications.	0.9783863516042148
During the past 2 years this method was used in treating 38 patients.	1.12611123743063
The surgical goal was attained in every case, and no immediate or long-term complications occurred.	1.3129047099868933
This method of combining septal cartilage with a resorbable implant leads to a better, significant correction of even severe septal deviations.	1.0591231224852204
Two types of corticosteroid receptors have been identified in the brain and pituitary that play an important role in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis.	0.7475804451216238
These glucocorticoid hormone binding receptors are the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR).	0.9722802895349076
Evidently, a tight control of the concentration and function of these receptors is of prime importance for maintaining and regaining homeostasis after stressful challenges.	1.0617383690914093
Here, we describe a novel mechanism revealing a rapid upsurge in MR density in the hippocampus (a limbic structure highly involved in HPA axis regulation) after an acute psychologically stressful challenge.	1.1586377804034815
This rise in MR is accompanied by a stronger MR-mediated inhibitory control of the HPA axis.	0.8996914869067932
Thus, an acute stressful experience results in a reorganization of the HPA axis involving a principal role of the hippocampal MR.	1.1610320372945075
This novel mechanism may be of significance for increasing our understanding of the etiology of stress-related disorders.	1.0743000512636967
The wide variety of therapeutic effects make neuroleptics potent drugs in the treatment of pain.	1.0095002831077309
Until now there has been no proof of their analgesic potency; in spite of this fact, neuroleptics are used to treat chronic pain states on the assumption that they do have analgesic potency.	1.1107511371534053
A metaanalysis was performed and 48 publications reviewed.	0.9348166452169198
Thirty-four, the majority of the studies, are case reports, retrospective analyses or non-randomised cohort studies.	1.2284615021781755
Most of these reports attest to a positive effect.	1.0622148726177445
However, only ten out of fifteen studies with a higher statistical study power describe a possible analgesic effect.	1.198970366997609
None of the studies could differentiate between the effects of analgesia and sedation of the drugs used.	1.1133495803733837
The metaanalysis provides no evidence of intrinsic analgesic properties of neuroleptics for their use as adjuvant analgesics.	0.871994118156247
Studies into the pathophysiology of acute ischaemic stroke have indicated that treatment options are likely to be optimised when early signs of stroke are recognised and treatment is initiated within 3 hours from symptom onset.	0.9449639831298876
For most patients there is a long delay between the onset of symptoms and the start of therapy.	1.0881125494510062
Many factors are responsible for this time delay: signs and symptoms often go unrecognised by patients, relatives and bystanders and stroke is not given a high priority by medical staff.	0.9852122824806707
Although a small number of stroke patients is treated as emergency and attended to by the emergency medical services within this time window, this number could easily be increased by intensified public and emergency personnel education.	1.0478210437687379
For the future, we hope that emergency medical services (EMS) will be able to initiate therapies which must be administered within the first few hours of acute stroke.	1.0047455791439655
Standard of care by the EMS personnel includes maintenance of oxygenation, treatment of cardiac arrhythmia and hypertension as well as hyperglycemia and hyperthermia.	1.0655404976059177
Early notification by the emergency medical services about stroke patients would enable stroke teams to be present at admission, thus improving the likelihood of a better outcome for patients.	0.9836752576390647
A decrease in compliance of the ascending aorta caused by prosthetic replacement or "wrapping" may lead to a partial loss of the arterial Windkessel-function.	1.0318393291470311
The following study investigated the effects of this intervention on aortic input impedance.	0.8542104225817898
In 8 pigs, the wall of the ascending aorta was wrapped with a prosthesis.	1.020089150432444
This approach was chosen to minimize additional influence of extended operative procedures on the ascending aorta, like extracorporal circulation, cardioplegia or blood loss.	0.9380917415818597
Flow and pressure were recorded before and after the intervention, and following Fourier Transformation, the aortic input impedance was calculated.	1.0748653676328923
Mean pressure, mean flow, and total peripheral resistance were unaltered, while there was a significant increase in blood pressure amplitude and characteristic impedance in response to the "wrapping" procedure.	1.1330493895781975
Thus, it becomes obvious that even the loss of elastic properties of the ascending aorta only leads to an increase of left ventricular load.	1.1545673432056704
Cervical lymphadenopathies are widespread diseases in otorhinolaryngology.	0.5622395301211842
There are many differential diagnoses which have to be considered when swelling persists.	1.0316729278301964
To gain further information it is advisable to perform sonographically controlled fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNP).	0.8380469217329141
If there is no reliable result, it is necessary to remove a lymph node.	1.0436061892064294
We report on the rare case of isolated histiocytosis X in lymph nodes.	1.096723501708375
A 63-year-old male had noticed a swelling of the right side of the neck about 6 weeks previously.	1.1228471393212371
The preliminary examinations (FNP/blood examinations) revealed no pathological findings.	0.8965292694689179
Only the histological examination delivered the diagnosis of histiocytosis X.	0.9644993765665774
Systemic manifestation was excluded by staging examinations.	0.6841744208760393
No further therapy was necessary after lymph node extirpation.	0.8241306900320078

We report our preliminary results using a new magnetic resonance imaging technique for visualization of the urinary tract.	1.1055973028769959
Using the paramagnetic contrast medium gadolinium diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA), we were able to obtain images of the urinary tract comparable to those obtained by conventional excretory urography.	1.025378876793484
The major advantage of our technique is that besides good morphologic visualization, the excretion of gadolinium-DTPA can be studied simultaneously.	0.9546857436261308
We demonstrate our preliminary results in selected cases.	0.5798114031321996
Microcallus formations are demonstrable in nearly all cancellous bones by means of suitable preparation techniques.	0.7674678076287959
Histologically, these structures are immature fibrous bone formed in local overloaded parts of the trabeculae.	0.9420533098389231
Using a preparation technique that allows combined two- and threedimensional analysis, 26 normal human spines and 11 osteoporotic spines were investigated for microcallus.	0.9984783777729112
Microcallus formations occur frequently in people over 45 years of age.	0.6351752406100754
They are mainly localized in the lower thoracic and lumbar spine and occur significantly more frequent in females than in males.	1.0205109228312443
The number of microcallus formations depends more on the microarchitecture of the cancellous bone than on individual trabecular parameters.	0.8444443870277569
In about 33 % of cases microfractures are demonstrable in the centre of the microcallus formation.	1.1226001146530502
In noninvasive studies the bone mass could be misinterpreted due to microcallus.	0.7821558129241695
Although it indicates instability of the bone structure, microcallus formation is not a purely negative mechanism.	1.0681678931696281
It stabilizes and regenerates the bone tissue.	0.6061150920528309
Furthermore, complete new trabeculae can be formed due to bridges of microcallus between residual trabeculae.	1.0876047560696749
Osteoporosis is not the result of an inability to form microcallus.	1.0465135388230753
DNA cytometric investigations of intraosseous cystic lesions and osteoblastic tumors may be helpful in morphological diagnosis.	0.8577164054682536
The detection of a DNA-aneuploid stemline supports the diagnosis of a high-grade malignant bone neoplasm, even in small biopsies.	1.2625148548642842
Solitary and aneurysmal bone cysts have DNA-diploid cell populations.	0.759511259542531
Low-grade central osteosarcomas may show single-cell aneuploidies of varying extent as well as a DNA-diploid stemline.	1.109721699385027
Their presence may be a sign of genetic instability within the population of neoplastic cells before a DNA-aneuploid stemline is established and should prompt careful postoperative observation.	0.9480354877180182
Although noise in general can induce hearing loss, environmental noise represents an important risk for children, teenagers and young adults.	1.0310523349363556
Epidemiological investigations now support the occurrence of an increasing number of irreversible hearing losses in these groups.	0.8950273880082984
Major causes of hearing loss are toys (guns), explosives and electroacoustically amplified music delivered by head sets or heard in discotheques and open air concerts.	0.9302008318699095
The development of arthroscopic wrist surgery has helped to understand the anatomy and pathology of the wrist joint.	0.8804146942187859
One of the most important functions of the arthroscopic inspection in the radiocarpal and mediocarpal joints is the evaluation of the wrist stability.	1.1351086482281263
State of the art in the hand surgery today includes a combination of arthroscopic and arthroscopic assisted operations.	1.059924093735984
The arthroscopy of the wrist offers significant information independent from the standard radiological diagnostic tools.	1.0443368485916915
TFCC lesions and scapholunate dissociation remain to be the most common causes for arthroscopic wrist surgery.	1.1164292488979584
Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) is a consequence of vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency and in the majority of cases due to alcoholism.	1.1223121214143983
We report here the case of a 26-year-old male alcoholic who had stayed helplessly at home for 4 days until hospital admission.	1.086560281568528
Clinical diagnosis was difficult due to major disturbance of consciousness.	0.8352614856393843
MRI showed an increase in signal intensity (T2-, FLAIR-weighted) around the third ventricle, the quadrigeminal bodies, the fornices, the mamillary bodies, the floor of the fourth ventricle and around the aqueduct.	1.200829002350482
These findings were indicative of WE although of unusual extent.	0.7772479300436987
In this case MRI correlated well with clinical symptomatology.	0.9959812168730557
Therapy with thiamine was started immediately and symptoms as well as MRI findings resolved partially.	0.8655346117732297
The presented case illustrates the diagnostic usefulness of MRI in WE especially if the patient is of reduced consciousness and clinical investigation is limited.	1.1033869575063862
Background: SLO microperimetric examination after the extraction of choroidal neovascular membranes (CNV) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) shows absolute scotoma in the area of pigment epithelial loss.	1.0666966836864984

The functional results of these two methods should be compared before the surgical procedure is expanded.	1.269613433562823
Three case reports of a pseudomeniscus and an angiomatoid vascular proliferation of the synovial membrane as rare aseptic complications of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty are presented.	0.9413998233619792
Neither complication can be confirmed by clinical examination, laboratory findings or diagnostic imaging techniques.	0.8586782139232028
Arthroscopy of the knee joint permits both diagnostic evaluation and low-risk surgical treatment.	1.0404342721184332
Strabismus surgery in children is associated with a high incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).	0.9685130166040097
We report on a case of a 23 years old man who was polytraumatized in a car accident.	1.160308421547773
He survived with excellent clinical outcome, but after 113 days after the accident he collapsed, massive bleeding out of the mouths started and the patient died within a few minutes.	1.2359397659688678

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of oral leukoplakia (OL) in HIV-positive patients and to evaluate the clinical and histopathological features and the presence of Candida hyphae and viral infections (HSV 1, 2, HPV, EBV and CMV) by immunocytochemical methods using mono- or polyclonal antibodies.	1.201761647728744
A total of 269 HIV-seropositive patients, (222 men, median age 36.7 years and 47 women, median age 32 years) were registered.	1.1984063861348648
OL occurred in 20/269 (7.4%) patients (men, smokers, median age 38 years); the non-homogeneous form was observed in 11%.	1.0411418082750328
A lesional biopsy specimen was obtained from 8/20 patients.	0.8351733832383768
Specimens did not show signs of epithelial dysplasia.	0.8311269246195515
Candida hyphae were evident in 2/8 cases.	0.8230784857237736
Two patients tested positive for HPV and CMV; antibodies against EBV, HSV1 and 2 were negative.	0.7777450092227663
In conclusion, the prevalence of OL is comparatively high in this group of HIV-seropositive patients (7.4% vs. 0.9-2.2%).	1.1756791679322542
Moreover, the mean age of the study group at the time of diagnosis for oL was lower (38 years vs. 60 years).	1.3091904482569419
Damage/dysfunctioning of the heart forms part of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in sepsis and SIRS.	0.9988072248559376
This acute septic cardiomyopathy is often underestimated in degree and relevance, although about 10% of all sepsis fatalities are due to intractable heart failure.	1.0965780057048444
This potentially reversible cardiomyopathy is characterized by a considerable pump failure, not primarily ischemic, with coronary blood flow being normal or even enhanced; the left and right ventricle is enlarged as a consequence of an increased ventricular compliance.	1.1849289536295293
Damage of the heart can further be aggravated in case of additional right ventricular impairment due to pulmonary hypertension in ARDS.	0.9846709675546982
SIRS-cardiomyopathy in non-infectious MODS has common traits with acute septic cardiomyopathy.	0.8331704634729101
The pathogenesis of heart disease in sepsis and SIRS is multifactorial, the endotoxin/TNF/NO/ cGMP-cascade representing a main negative inotropic axis.	1.0288913994009883
Therapy of acute septic cardiomyopathy and SIRS-cardiomyopathy at present is still mainly symptomatic (volume substitution, inotropic/vasoactive agents); causal therapeutic principles are, however, put to test in the context of a comprehensive concept of causal sepsis treatment.	1.1071898702287684
Fractures of the distal metaphysis of the tibia often include an extension into the ankle.	1.0589574157080905
Intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw osteosynthesis should reduce the high incidence of soft tissue and ankle problems and should be an alternative to open plate fixation, with good ultimate functional outcome.	1.058425520048408
Between January 1993 and December 1995, a prospective study on 49 patients with distal metaphyseal tibia fracture and involvement of the ankle was performed.	1.0990418509535596
All the fractures were treated with intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw osteosynthesis, and plate fixation in cases of fibula fractures.	0.9174627842107069
There were 27 men and 22 women with an average age of 46.4  +/-  12.7 years (range 21-90).	1.1548544642610392
In most studies of the use of intramedullary nailing in distal tibial fractures the classification has been inadequate.	0.9103816565088356
Therefore a new classification according to Robinson et al.	0.8040084118506012
(1995) was used: 10 fractures were type II B (20.4 %), 13 were type II C (26.5 %), and 26 patients suffered a combination of type II B and type II C (53.1 %).	1.1711444111251141
This fracture type was defined as type II D for use in this study.	0.9048796311122799
The severity of soft tissue injury was recorded using the Gustilo system in case of open (n = 19) and the Tscherne system in case of closed fractures (n = 30).	1.1009610183001886
In 31 patients distal tibia fracture was accompanied by a fracture of the fibula, which was first stablized using a plate.	1.1087345604332752
For reconstruction of the distal articular surface, covered screw osteosynthesis was done.	1.001368018359596
At the next step intramedullary nails were inserted and were statically locked proximally and distally.	0.8357117897721529
From January 1993 to February 1994, the reamed AO standard nail was used.	0.8305185929862318
After introduction of the unreamed tibial nail (UTN) all fractures were treated by this implant.	1.000997079417886
Full load on the operated leg was allowed after 8 weeks.	0.83313074827223
Union of the fracture was assessed by standard radiological and clinical criteria.	1.1942686165803638
Misalignment was defined as more than 5  ° of angular rotation.	1.0984027538689436
Further surgery due to a valgus deformity in the ankle joint had to be done in three cases.	1.033604592646737
There were no deep infections.	1.025220066466489
Three patients had a superficial infection in the ankle area, but surgical debridement was not necessary.	1.2641234485357058
A leg shortening was found in 4 cases, but it was less than 1 cm in every case.	1.312432599995369
Therefore, surgical correction was not done.	1.4852463858548826
Patients were reviewed at intervals of 2, 6, and 12 weeks, and after 6, and at least 12 months.	1.4287555815823356
All 49 patients were finally reviewed after an average time of 15.7 months (range 12-38).	1.1641831061244203
Bone fusion was reached 12.8 weeks (range 9-21) after the operative treatment.	1.1562633988098832
A specific assessment of the ankle symptoms was made using the score of Olerud and Molander (1984).	1.0421429450621378
In 29 patients excellent results were recorded.	0.7352386834601363
A satisfactory result was attained with 17 patients and just 3 patients were found to be unsatisfactory.	0.9647227188833241
Although proximity of distal tibia fracture to the ankle makes the treatment more complicated than for fractures of the tibial diaphysis, closed intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw fixation is a good alternative to open reduction and plate fixation.	0.9138547692343324
The major advantages are closed procedure and simplified interlocking techniques.	0.7544404032470658
Therefore, closed intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw fixation is a safe and effective method of managing this type of fracture.	0.9345606126906202
Laryngeal candidiasis is very rare in the absence of other more proximal diseases in the aerodigestive tract.	0.969724147420986
The lesion shows pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia or acanthosis and, given its rarity, may be confused with cancer.	0.9710106034377907
In the present paper we report on a 56-year-old male patient who presented with hoarseness.	1.1234788620629903
Physical examination of the larynx revealed a hyperplastic lesion involving both vocal cords.	0.8290734462457845
The clinical aspect and the risk factor profile of the patient (ten bottles of beer and 40 cigarettes per day) generated the clinical diagnosis of laryngeal cancer.	1.1926144910693002
The histopathological examination of the specimen excluded a squamous cell carcinoma; however, it could not provide a clear diagnosis.	1.1101907375797364
Laryngeal papillomatosis and tuberculosis, which had been suspected, could be excluded.	1.03613505836497
As the lesion progressed, further biopsies led to the diagnosis of candidiasis.	1.0340946335199022
Systemic antimycotic treatment with fluconazol and amphotericin caused a complete remission.	0.7938328215689282
Lymphatic spread of bronchial carcinoma can reach any part of the mediastinum, irrespective of the localisation of the primary tumor.	0.8824482053502368
Metastatic spread may not affect al topographical lymph node positions, but this is unpredictable.	1.0146924339696968
The number of lymph nodes in each position varies.	0.8449977973462148
Therefore, systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection includes all ipsilateral compartments of the mediastinum.	1.026666262254641
It is also possible to reach contralateral sites.	1.0672262919457953
In right-sided thoracotomies the lymph node dissection is standardized.	0.9720496652233646
Mobilizing the aortic arch and the large vessels also allows complete mediastinal dissection by a left-sided approach.	0.8703121387357386
The surgical technique is described.	0.9031343116304592
Perioperative morbidity does not increase.	0.5654721441953844
Systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection is the gold standard for evaluation of an exact pN stage.	0.8810424605039158
The stage-related survival rate is significantly improved.	1.0654607178094213
Therefore, it should be required that systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection be standard in the surgical treatment of bronchial carcinoma.	1.1829161972307567
In the diagnosis and treatment of acute scrotal pain and swelling it is important to differentiate between testicular torsion and epididymo-orchitis.	1.0688237813731436
A special case of a thirty-eight-year-old male asylant from Nepal was presented in the urological service with acute scrotal pain.	1.1119766800693027
To exclude testicular torsion, a diagnostic exploration of the scrotum was done with the findings of an acute funiculitis with abscess formation.	1.1132413540441344
Under surgical drainage of abscess together with medical treatment the acute inflammation disappeared.	0.8000993325554125
The diagnosis of filarial funiculitis was made after identifying the microfilariae in a blood vessel and in the peripheral blood smear.	1.076739324229353
A filaricide medication with diethylcarbamacine citran was administered with good symptomatic relief.	0.7210878397719036
We studied 10 patients with Parkinson's disease and 12 patients with Parkinson-plus-syndrome, trying to improve patients' gait by application of various external rhythmic stimuli, including metronome stimulation (96 beats per minute=middle andante).	0.9973978025269424
The test course of the patients was 4x10 meters and 3 U-turns.	1.2218438649910532
The patients' gait quality under stimulation was compared with their free walk (velocity, number of steps, number of freezing episodes).	1.0008917539550206
Metronome stimulation significantly reduced the time and number of steps needed for the test course and also diminished the number of freezing episodes.	1.0598417998675285
March music stimulation was less effective and tactile stimulation (rhythmically tapping on the patient's shoulder) even produced negative results.	0.9368955586923501
The positive effect of metronome stimulation was also found, when the tests were not performed inside the hospital building, but outside in the hospital parc.	1.196680144436623
Metronome stimulation was comparably effective in both patient sub-groups examined in this study (M. Parkinson, Parkinson-plus-syndrome) and seems to be an important additional help in the treatment of these patients.	1.1749878893078147
Electronical metronomes are not expensive, easy in handling, and portable.	0.9890274827850062
A theoretical explanation of metronome stimulation effectivity in patients with Parkinson's disease still needs to be elucidated.	0.7391761246228553
The occurrence of perineural epithelial complexes within the pancreas cannot always be regarded as evidence of malignancy.	0.8095687971941348
Chronic pancreatitis can induce alterations in the anatomy of the organ with a histological picture comparable to that of neural invasion.	0.9788236761680867

Deciduosis of the appendix is a rare cause of acute appendicitis in pregnancy.	1.0946857981153992
Ectopic decidual cells localized in the submesothelial stroma may represent a physiologic reaction of the pluripotent stromal cells to progestational hormonal stimulation.	0.7769803104103927
Less frequently, deciduosis is based on a preexisting extragenital endometriosis, visible in a localization other than strictly submesothelial, in residuals of cyclic proliferation and bleeding, and in endometrial glandular formations embedded in the decidual cells.	1.0711651268547238
In 14 patients with acute LBP the effect of manual therapy was examined.	1.0520942953646253
The examination was conducted with the Triflexometer, which is an electromechanical measuring instrument for examination of the posture and function of the spine.	1.1298917038164136
This instrument makes possible the measurement of the spine in resting as well as in moving positions, and it is also suitable for recording local disturbances of the movement.	1.2371866995548872
In our study we measured the spine from C7 to S2 in the sagittal and frontal planes.	1.004650260447608
Improvement in movement was detected in all patients following manual therapy, as well as in ante-, retro- and lateral flexion on both sides, and local functional disturbances also disappeared partially or totally.	1.208831672219128
Our study shows that the Triflexometer makes it possible to record the effect of manual therapy in acute LBP.	0.9125677097464445
The proof of the local functional disturbances after manual therapy indicates that these patients have a higher risk of new episodes of acute LBP or perhaps of chronic LBP, and because of that there it is necessary to use other treatment forms.	1.1131865890839963
Diagnostic imaging after renal transplantation is of high importance in the differential diagnosis of peri-and postoperative complications.	0.9579310241397806

The amino acids arginine and ornithine are mainly important for immunological gut cells as precursors of NO and polyamine synthesis.	0.7998566382578022
Complex carbohydrates are fermented in the lower gut portions to short-chain fatty acids, mainly acetic, propionic and butyric acid.	0.9529655767550195
The trophic effect of these acids is also mediated via an improvement of blood flow.	0.9596807437685884
Among the trophic substances independent of nutrients are the hormones gastrin and enteroglucagon and various growth factors, contributing to the maintenance of a eutrophic gut mucosa.	0.8267985092552488
We investigated 88 Patients with a total of 102 angiographically diagnosed intracranial aneurysms by means of transcranial colour coded Duplex sonography (TCCD) during a time period of 15 months.	0.9955662409650093
Both the size and teh localization of teh aneuryms were determined.	0.7186726403316802
Seventy aneurysms (77%) with a diameter of 16 +/- 8 mm (6-55mm) were detectable, with excellent visualization in 36 (42%), moderate visualization in 34 (40%), and no sufficient visualization in 16 (16%) aneurysms, respectively.	1.288885362040587
In another 16 cases (16%) there was no sufficient vone window.	1.0873883427590127
Thrombotic material inside the aneurysm was detectable in 16/20 cases (75%), visualization of coil embolized aneurysms in 12/25 patients (48%).	1.0005921767622585

In contrast to carotid endarterectomy, the indication for vertebral surgery is not standardized.	1.1028885553343015
In a prospective study including 44 patients, it was investigated whether extended diagnostics help in making the decision as to whether operative treatment should be given.	1.2009528493009411
The diagnostic procedures included DSA, CCT, MRI, 24 h ECG, otoneurological, and neurological examination, and ultrasonic flow measurement.	1.0528357821179446
We compared the diagnostic results before and after surgery with the subjective symptoms of the patients.	1.1660467772440166
Two different surgical procedures were used: transposition of the vertebral artery to the CCA or graft implantation between CCA and atlas loop.	0.9436361289753564
In the follow up period (6 - 9 months), 72% of the patients had improved or were without complaints.	1.4693660438248937
The validity of the applied diagnostic parameters relating to a successful operation were disappointing especially the ultrasonic flow measurement.	0.9235102657205143
In our opinion, exact anamnesis and sufficient angiography are decisive for the indication of vertebral surgery.	0.8628497139730374
It has long been a goal to develop a means to measure squint angles in three dimensions simultaneously.	0.8627659361798385
A three-dimensional binocular method is naturally needed especially with surgical procedures that affect three dimensions of ocular motility.	0.903704772908148
In situations of depressed myocardial function, the role of immunological mechanisms has been studied recently.	0.8964381104785062
In different pathophysiological situations, such as chronic heart failure, open heart surgery with extracorporal circulation, cardiac transplantation, myocardial infarction and angina pectoris, patterns have been described with elevation of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and reversible myocardial dysfunction, which may represent a final common pathway.	1.201853697586008
The available data suggest a modulation of important determinants of pump function, i.e., contractility, preload, afterload, and heart rate, by cytokines.	1.1320615450481863
Potential mechanisms include the -adrenoceptor- and nitric oxide pathway, as well as a direct impact on intracellular calcium homeostasis.	1.1318170714675282
Interventional strategies based on this understanding are beginning to emerge.	0.8148055452060664
A prospective randomized study was designed to determine the effect of postoperative water contact on tissue healing.	0.9329922039396342
A total of 121 patients undergoing open hernia repair was divided into two groups.	0.8575020289977261
The first group was permitted to shower postoperatively, allowing the wound to come into direct contact with the water, the second group was instructed to keep the incision dry.	1.0203871888631921
Water contact, wound healing and patient satisfaction were assessed.	0.8460930194722156
There was no difference in wound healing between the two groups and no manifest infection.	1.0858470079022575
In children and adolescents motor/vocal tics and obsessive-compulsive behavior are known to be closely related.	0.8503080842926745
Thereby, a continuum of symptoms ranging from single tics to a mixed picture of tics/rituals/obsessive-compulsive traits to clinically relevant obsessions and compulsions could be described.	0.9271676814107471
As neurobiological substrates dysfunctions in corresponding cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits (sensorimotor circuit in tic symptomatology, orbitofrontal circuit in obsessive-compulsive behavior) were postulated.	0.8364136106416761
For both disturbances behavioral therapy can be used to improve control mechanisms to counterregulate tics and obsessive-compulsive behavior, respectively, and psychopharmacological agents can be administerd to compensate dysbalances in neurotransmitter systems.	0.9427933321000557
In case of a mixed symptomatologic picture it is necessary to include interventions for both pols of the symptom-continuum in the therapeutic programme to achieve extensive improvement as a basis for a further positive development of the patient.	1.0972908161539017
As laparoscopic cholecystectomy becomes more established, interest in legal aspects increases.	0.8227421061313037
The legal cases dealt with in Germany since the introduction of this laparoscopic method in 1989 were studied to determine the legal consequences of complications.	0.9281569348149694
Of 40 cases, 16 were judged to be cases of malpractice, whereas 24 were not.	0.9153776523036414
The most common cause was injury of the common bile duct (26 cases).	1.0805018220132814
Seven of these 26 cases were judged to be cases of malpractice, 2 of these as grave errors.	0.8914463957417839
The main reasons for the acceptance of a case as malpractice were delay in changing to conventional cholecystectomy, delayed revision, laparoscopic revisions and not reverting to conventional cholecystectomy in unclear situations.	1.025537914970969
Purpose of this review is, to highlight key issues in transplantation medicine today and to summarise basic information on current state of perfused organ transplantation.	1.1024034483510843
There is special emphasis on ethical and legal considerations with regard to living donor transplantation, brain death concept, donor consent and organ allocation.	0.9961583963786091
Transplantation frequencies and the impact of whole organ transplantation on the treatment concept for patients with end stage organ disease is heavily dependent on donor and organ availability.	1.0076785889555016
Organ donor rate of 25 to 30 donors per million inhabitants per year seems to yield sufficient organ supply for patients on renal replacement therapy.	0.8797563440679419
15 to 20 liver transplantations per million inhabitants per year, my be sufficient, to cover the need of organs for non malignant end stage liver diseases.	0.9446984524542009
This frequency my be achieved by increasing donor rates and employing "split techniques", where one liver is used for two recipients.	1.1846744657627153
One year graft survival in kidney transplantation can be expected to be between 85 and 90 %, one year patient survival in heart and liver transplantation can be expected to be beyond 80 %.	1.1459903123526456
The risk of organ failure is highest in the first year, long term results are dependent on incidence of chronic rejection, comorbidity of the patient and original disease.	1.2891831658589414
Patient- and/or graft loss after the first year is in the order of 1 to 5 %.	1.1758267429686893
Whole organ transplantation for kidneys, hearts and livers are considered routine procedures, lung transplantation is reaching standard phase, pancreas and combined pancreas kidney transplantation is well established technically, but its indication is still controversial.	1.0353672871073802
Laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy (LITT) is a promising method of treating different types of tumors.	0.9284710529472454
To increase the effectiveness of LITT, a new thermo-controlled application system for minimal invasive intervention was designed.	1.0408677704262486
This laser system consists of a laser applicator 3 mm in diameter, insertion equipment and an Nd:YAG laser source.	0.892801826671375
The power of the laser source is controlled dynamically by thermosensors in a water-cooling system of the laser applicator.	0.9927066634608323
In in vivo experiments in five pigs, within 10 min we found homogeneous coagulation regions in the liver that were of 3 cm and 5 cm in diameter.	1.1204855197968027
Via ultrasound we observed in real time the increasing coagulation zone that appeared as a hyperechogenic halo.	0.8862536525212021
However, due to perifocal edema, the real coagulation area was smaller than detected by ultrasound.	1.1417414202344511
Macroscopically and microscopically, the coagulation zones showed well-demarcated borders of the coagulation lesions, and the surrounding tissue appeared vital.	1.2262369441900534
The reparative reaction after irradiation was early fibrosis.	0.6624170122027154
In the course of 4 weeks, the surrounding scar capsule, containing fibrocytes, biliary ductules and collagen fibers enlarged.	0.987721567434575
As a result, the coagulation necrosis became more and more fragmented between collagen fibers and was largely resorbed.	0.9793332311625417
The absence of complications in our animal experiments suggest that the technique of thermo-controlled laser light application is safe and useful in therapy for metastases that are not resectable.	1.0286242594343113
Attachment theory, originally developed by John Bowlby, becomes increasingly relevant in the field of psychotherapy (research).	0.9162061141279927
This review starts with a definition of central concepts and hypotheses of this theory and summarizes results regarding the development as well as correlates of attachment, mainly from research in developmental psychology.	1.0170128921319326
Related to adults, attachment theory has to be reconceptualized which is done in another part of this paper.	1.0090706982187885
Finally, some common methods for the assessment of adult attachment are described which play an important role in clinical studies (these will be the content of the part 2 of this review).	1.2543225119327512
Inflammation-mediated osteopenia is an animal model for bone mass reduction following chronic inflammation.	0.93450080872546
We found a reduction of calcitriol serum concentrations during the inflammatory process, in addition cytokines are increased.	1.159858020523957
Treatment of the animals with calcitriol is able to prevent bone mass reduction and to preserve bone formation.	0.9756551541667877
Anxiolysis with drugs and psychoprophylaxis are both recognised methods of preoperative preparation.	0.7795038386852836
The beneficial effects of anxiolytics, however, appear to be difficult to prove.	0.971857504380098
In this study a comparison was made of heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and norepinephrine, epinephrine, and cortisol levels.	1.260101386615424
In group I 19 children recieved only psychological treatment, while in group II 21 children received 0.2 mg/kg midazolam orally.	1.0850939379615672
Measuring points were directly before medication, 30 min afterward, and at induction of anaesthesia.	1.164054145606514
During the observation period the patients (5-10 years old) remained calm.	1.148703597138922
At the beginning of the study the parameters of all patients were within a normal range; 30 min after premedication the HR and BP were significantly higher in group I than in group II.	1.356820654112088
In contrast to group I, epinephrine levels in group II were lower at the beginning of anaesthesia than before premedication.	1.146492537586697
In both groups, norepinephrine levels were the same at induction of anaesthesia as before premedication.	0.8487245830551458
Cortisol decreased only in patients who received midazolam.	1.2671975161550586
HR, BP, as well as humoral stress parameters indicate that midazolam in a dose of 0.2 mg/kg orally is sufficient to reduce preoperative stress in children.	0.9254205531278714
A case of isolated right ventricular myocardial tuberculoma with pericardial effusions is presented.	0.9672870187120385
The diagnosis of myocardial tuberculoma was initially suggested by echocardiography and later by magnetic resonance imaging.	1.0400861784297535
The diagnosis of cardiac tuberculosis was confirmed by demonstration of tubercle bacilli in the pericardial fluid.	0.8610803936933262
This is a very rare condition which is usually diagnosed only by necropsy.	1.1640953669831788
Myocardial tuberculoma should figure on the list of intraparietal masses visualized at echocardiography.	0.6757043722601299
The incidence of hepatitis A infections has decreased due to improved hygienic conditions in Germany.	0.878278751445331
However, hepatitis A is one of the most important diseases imported to the country.	1.3380665219418975
Currently, more than the half of all registered hepatitis A infections are acquired in foreign countries.	1.1137544397010146
According to the decreased morbidity over the past few decades most younger people (age below 50 years) are not immunized and, subsequently, this age group is at higher risk during exposure in foreign countries.	1.2438562406264868
Therefore, a hepatitis A vaccination is recommended before travelling in countries with a higher incidence of hepatitis A (Southern Europe, Africa, South America, and Asia).	1.1037090333568191
Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) are a group of Gram-positive organism, which have in common a fermentative metabolism with lactic acid as the major end-product.	1.1858416097975994
Except for bifidobacteria, the LAB are phylogenetically closely related.	0.8726964270399767
They directly contribute to human well-being as they are the most important germs in the production process of fermented foods which constitute one fourth of our diet.	1.0750666338756205
They are, furthermore, an essential component of the mucosal flora and especially of the intestinal flora.	1.21457955982226
The genus Streptococcus contains highly pathogenic species which can be clearly differentiated from the useful germs.	0.8854982315199554
The intestinal flora contains such species of the genus Lactobacillus that are also important in food fermentation and species which are strongly adapted to the intestines and therefore, can be found exclusively in this ecological niche.	1.0874714374448964
A special status characterises bifidobacteria and enterococci.	0.663201577879919
The former are located in a separate phylogenetic branch and also occur virtually exclusively in the intestines.	0.9186481208531284
Enterococci are rather ubiquitous, participate in indigenous food fermentations, are found in the mucosal flora and are counted as opportunistic pathogens.	0.9627010507991056
To influence the intestinal flora and to achieve health promoting effects LAB are isolated from the intestinal flora, grown and employed either as pharmaceutical preparations or additions to food (usually fermented milk).	0.9454822810014019
These bacteria are termed "probiotics".	0.6729848570570215
The exposition of consumers to high numbers of germs belonging to one or a few species needs an evaluation of their safety for human health.	0.8364813062807955
In this process the traditional experience with the safe nature of the species can serve as an important criterion.	1.0322081300518822
In front of this background, LAB in probiotics can be considered to be especially safe, nevertheless some restrictions have to be made.	0.9556836200000133
Generally, the germs used should not contain genes encoding transmissible resistance to antibiotics.	0.897115480156468
In addition they should not produce biogenic amines (e.g.	0.5543976448637981
histamine, tyrosine or phenylethylamine) and should not degrade mucine.	1.0132933805636166
The assessment may also include the following: absence of a potential for deconjugation of bile salts, induction of platelet aggregation and binding to fibrinogen and fibronectine.	0.948240057484815
These examinations may be required as certain LAB have been identified in clinical isolates.	1.0324498894347673
The isolates were, however, obtained in the most majority of cases from debilitated patients.	1.2096605745985678
The germs were components of the body flora as well as of the environment, organisms deliberately employed in food fermentations or probiotics have never been isolated.	1.0520174329502745
Dural sinus thrombosis is not uncommon.	0.517319681361322
Due to the nonspecific symptomatology, as well as the manifold etiology, clinical diagnosis may be difficult.	1.1773568864502604
In these cases imaging procedures are frequently crucial in deciding how to proceed and how to treat.	0.9790228924558971
The aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic utility of helical CT in the detection of dural sinus thrombosis.	0.8634835356171504
In 20 patients with clinically suspected thrombosis CT angiography was performed.	0.9223395413040602
In 6 patients dural sinus thrombosis was diagnosed.	0.8013813185226056
In order to acquire also arterial vessels, a short delay of about 22 s after the onset of the application of contrast medium was selected.	1.1439576882845226
By this method we found an occlusion of the MCA in two patients with clinically suspected sinus thrombosis.	1.1486558857255182
In all patients the transverse slices and the multiplanar reconstructions showed filling defects or an "empty delta" sign.	0.9541328348909396
With irregular outlines the thrombus could be depicted over the complete course of the sinus.	0.9897719172296302
The MIP reconstructions were particularly helpful in the evaluation of the vessel anatomy and the pathological collateral venous drainage.	0.9551009642093078
In three patients MR angiograms were available for comparison.	0.8170250987538779
The smaller veins, such as the v. vermis inferior, were less clearly depicted than in CT angiography.	1.0824537295097338
CT angiography is a fast and reliable method to exclude or verify a sinus thrombosis.	0.8899582740035643
It can be performed immediately after non-enhanced CT.	0.9813438019125702
According to our present experience CT angiography is sufficient for the diagnosis of a sinus thrombosis.	1.0878841929712082
Coronary angiography ist considered to be the most important component in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease.	1.0190028150157286
Only the lumen may be visualized using contrast radiography of the coronary arteries, however.	0.898697673813967
With intravascular ultrasound, on the other hand, pathological changes in the vascular wall can be recorded.	0.94601778881733
Despite typical symptoms, an angiographical image of the coronary arteries is sometimes unable to show unambiguous stenotic lesions of the coronary arteries.	0.9786391955886826
In such cases, intravascular ultrasound provides a new complementary diagnostic tool for detecting even early forms of arteriosclerosis or angiographically underestimated coronary findings.	0.9513684817622822
Two cases are used to illustrate this.	0.9126897529134107
In those, angiographic visualization of the coronary arteries was unable to produce an unambiguous finding despite typical clinical symptoms, yet intravascular ultrasound could detect considerable arteriosclerotic wall changes.	0.8912553582377016
Purpose: The pontine micturition center plays a central role in regulating the micturition reflex, but the precise neural mechanisms are unclear.	1.103907183961593
The cerebral cortex is involved in coordinating micturition but there is little knowledge on specific evolutionary higher brain regions.	0.8570611515272862
The present study aimed to investigate whether cortical activation during micturition can be demonstrated by EEG power spectra patterns and to explore whether specific cortical regions involved in the interaction of inhibition and release during the micturition reflex can be discerned.	1.0338546610083503
We also aimed to test whether intravesical electrostimulation (IVES) therapy in patients with micturition disorders has an effect on patterns of cortical activity.	0.9638862800783121
Background: Indirect traumatic optic neuropathy represents a severe, potential vision-threatening disease process that requires close interdisciplinary cooperation for treatment.	1.051113323137846
In general, any therapy has been dis-cussed controversially in the literature.	0.7965194260901358
Based upon experiences with spinal cord trauma, high-dose steroid therapy is recommended initially to minimize secondary consequences following orbital trauma.	1.0010692320250942
The usefulness of surgical decompression of the optic nerve has been confirmed in several studies but is still not recommended in principle.	1.0978353802859782
In recent years there has been an increasing incidence of streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome (TSLS) in otherwise healthy adults.	1.1085619896749874
It is characterized by fever, rash, hypotension and early shock with consecutive organ failure and a mortality rate of about 30 %.	0.9620513594701879
This paper describes the history of two patients with severe streptococcal TSLS.	1.0545581560588564
Various aspects of the pathophysiology, diagnosis and therapy are discussed.	1.0534204164947674
Only early, aggressive and repeated surgical debridement can reduce the bacterial load and decrease circulating exotoxins and thereby, in combination with antibiotic therapy, decrease the high mortality of this entity.	1.0867854260026826
Purpose: To test, whether axial, coronal and sagittal MIP and MPR reconstructions of diagnostic quality can be obtained from 1-mm collimation MSCT data of the chest for the evaluation of thoracic anatomy and pathology.	1.1720232781312356
The risk to health posed by a sedentary lifestyle is a problem of our times.	0.8883234102911151
In contrast to the previous assumption that only fairly high-intensity sporting exercise undertaken over a minimum period of 20 min produces health-related benefits, recent studies have shown that even everyday activitites (climbing stairs, brisk walking and cycling) can have a benedicial effects on health, particularly in those who take little exercise.	1.1118951412559404
So now the recommendation is: exercise of moderate intensity lasting 30 min at least 5 times a week, corresponding to an energy consumption of about 150 kacl/day or 1000 kcal/week.	0.9037339471686382
The results of experimental studies on sport and arthritis and sport and osteoporosis point to the advisability of taking up or maintaining an active sporting lifestyle.	0.9301868968564465
