Introduction: Avoidance of extracorporeal circulation during beating heart surgery (OP CAB = Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery) for aortocoronary bypass grafting (ACBG) is gaining increasing importance in modern cardiac surgery.	0.6512769683690444
With the development of new mechanical stabilization devices, the revascularization of the posterior wall of the heart and the distal rith coronary artery became feasable.	0.687659237280983
Especially high-risk patients with multiple risk factors for open heart surgery will profit from this approach, because the negative effects of the extracorporeal circulation are avoided.	0.8305362821035299
Although dementia is described as one of the constituent characteristics of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), alongside gait disturbances and urinary incontinence, there is a rather limited number of controlled studies concerning neuropsychological deficits in the disease.	0.6073485097942335
A wide range of psychopathologically relevant symptoms have been described, but the common features of most cases include mental and motor slowing, apathy, emotional indifference, anosognosia, memory and attentional impairment.	0.5527176641249424
A number of other functional deficits such as dyslexia, dysgraphia, acalculia, apraxia can also frequently be found.	0.3550155181224201
Some emphasis is put on the work of J. de Mol (Brussels) which appears to be most important for the study of neuropsychological symptoms in NPH patients.	0.6289471004739604
The methodological standard of a number of studies has been found to be rather low, and yet a sound neuropsychological investigation may be of utmost importance for the diagnosis and neurosurgical outcome assessment.	0.7814674006636609
Concerning morphological correlates of the functional deficits in NPH, various hypotheses have been formulated, but it is argued that symptoms can neither be described as predominantly "diffuse" in nature, nor can they be reduced to unilocular dysfunctions.	0.6771867585486535
Recommendations for future research strategies are formulated.	0.4316867769397276
Up to now there are no published results of therapy of paraphilia (Pedophilia, Sadism) and sexual aggressive impulsiveness with LHRH-(luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone) Agonists in the Germanspeaking countries.	0.6083715850255482
In this report we describe 11 patients which were treated with the LHRH-Agonist Leuprolide Acetate in a period of 12 months.	0.6712858846133951
The patients showed no tendency of sexuell aggressive behaviour and reported an evident reduction of penile erection, ejaculation, masturbation, sexual deviant impulsiveness and phantasies.	0.4172591040793502
One patient died from suicide.	0.662718213161141
In combination with other treatments LHRH-Agonist seem to be a very promising alternative to cyproterone acetate and its possible carcinogene effects.	0.6206011040700533
Aim of the study: To investigate the long-term effect of TNFR55-IgG1 in patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis refractory to multiple previous DMARD treatments.	0.7117861107777705
Methods: Between 1994 and 1995 we recruited 80 patients for two double blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trials.	0.5244588351936165
All patients were treated for 2-30 months with a glycosylated fused protein consisting of two human p55 TNF receptors linked to a human IgG1-Fc.	0.5691637093772794
The dose range was 2.5-100mg/month given i.v.	0.5549960182259439
with cumulative doses from 40-940mg.	0.2572247985136097
All patients were followed-up prospectively for 24-36 months after initiation of therapy.	0.6587328971375563
The evaluations included a 48 swollen and tender joint count, ESR, CRP, RF, ANA, ENA, and safety parameters at 6 month intervals.	0.3764123982892776
In addition, pharmacokinetics, TNF, and anti-TNFR55-IgG1 antibody levels were available after the first and third injection.	0.5583149456049749
Results: Data from 80 patients are available representing an experience of more than 170 patient years;  11 patients are still being treated.	0.7495365635267273
Predominant reasons for treatment withdrawal were restrictions in treatment protocol.	0.3167996661860748
Six patients died  (1 during treatment, 5 in the post-treatment follow-up).	0.8545501156648834
All deaths were related to preexisting cardiovascular disease except one post-surgery septic arthritis 6 months after the last dosing (during vacation in another country).	0.4892834238192013
Anti-TNFR55-IgG1 antibodies correlated with a decrease in drug half-time.	0.3685596528435662
Shifts in the TNFR55-IgG1 glycosylation pattern affected pharmacokinetics and efficacy.	0.30234888434839197
A lupus nephritis occurred 18 months after the last dosing in one patient with erosive RA (ANA and dsDNS positive already before TNFR55-IgG1 initiation).	0.49705842142985684
Continued treatment for 3 years in 11 patients resulted in an 81% reduction in swollen joint count, less morning stiffness, less pain, and a reduction in steroids.	0.7950986407472822
Conclusion: Treatment with TNFR55-IgG1 is safe and efficacious over the long-term in patients with severe refractory RA.	0.6199976271647022
For both VFR and as IFR flight, visual assessment is the major source of information for the pilot.	0.5823792132165615
The new possibilities for change of refraction by means of corneal refractive surgery have led to an increasing demand from pilots for these new methods.	0.5072387759256611
Can these methods successfully be applied for aviation purposes?	0.31383775581742773
The valid regulations for medical standards of pilots, as well as the future international regulations such as JAR and ICAO, are explained in this respect.	0.5077624608251735
A report is given on the work of the Advisory Board of the German Federal Government Air Traffic Authority and on the cases treated so far and their outcome, and recommendations are expressed.	0.6517675987403607
Concerning the legal situation and clinical experience, advice for pilots, aviation medical examiners and ophthalmologists is given.	0.37412657126177334
Persistent remnants of the caudal müllerian ducts can manifest in several forms and are often associated with other urogenital disorders, especially hypospadias.	0.5714358072981934
Inadequate activity of the müllerian inhibiting factor, in addition to fetal testosterone deficiency, is responsible for this syndrome.	0.7387846066081923
The etiology, diagnosis and management of müllerian duct remnants are discussed.	0.4587333350773052
A complex case of penile-scrotal hypospadia, hypoplastic prostate gland, testicular ectopia and retrovesical cyst is presented.	0.3164156194492658
The official German guidelines for prevention of nosocomial pneumonia were published by the Bundesgesundheitsamt, now called Robert-Koch-Institut, twelve years ago.	0.368210543264475
The recently published official "guidelines for prevention of nosocomial pneumonia" of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are categorized according to scientific evidence.	0.44335313816200284
The American guidelines are very detailed and differ in some aspects from the official German guidelines.	0.2900952513980966
The purpose of the present paper is to inform the German anaesthesiologist about the official CDC guidelines and to provide a renewed background for the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia.	0.665046684976819
At present, the importation into Germany of life-threatening and highly contagious diseases such as pneumonic plague and Ebola is unlikely, but cannot be ruled out.	0.5009699842005471
In spite of the extreme rarity of these diseases, guidelines are necessary to prevent the spread of these agents in case of their importation.	0.711943864174254
In Germany, marked regional differences exist with respect to the development of emergency regulations and the availability of specialized centers for diagnostics and therapy.	0.4583379289167085
A federal framework is missing.	0.13869351417902295
A concept is presented here in which the capacity to respond is substantially augmented with limited additional cost through inter-regional cooperation using existing infrastructure and federally standardized procedures.	0.4099672300103158
The therapeutic effect and the side effects of fumaric acid derivatives used in treatment of psoriasis vulgaris have been subjects of controversy for more than 30 years.	0.6886665739669219
A total of 83 patients with severe psoriasis vulgaris were investigated in as ingle-centre, long-term open (12 months) clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of the fumaric acid ester preparations Fumaderm initial and Fumaderm.	0.699930154983509
The antipsoriatic effect of the fumaric acid derivatives was clear, with a mean reduction of 76% in PASI.	0.7907928176409674
Adverse events in were noted in 62% of the patients (mainly flushing and gastrointestinal complaints).	0.6371358435591715
These were dose-dependent and decreased in frequency in the course of the study.	0.7204588894930158
No severe adverse events occurred.	0.2298342413693609
We believe that of fumaric acid derivatives are indicated in cases of severe therapy-resistant psoriasis to and can be used even for long-term application.	0.6820150920030309
Background: Because retinal necrosis syndrome seldom occurs, we present our results of silicone oil tamponade for associated retinal detachment.	0.6758632119679778
The eyelids are the site of many different pathological conditions.	0.47538386880203715
Swelling - often oedematous - is a frequent symptom.	0.9863846728221326
This publication deals with the pathophysiological and anatomical basis of eyelid swelling and mainly provides a practical approach for differential diagnosis with the help of flow and short characterisations of possible causes.	0.5202044981060188
The subjective complaints of the patient charts (pain, pruritus) are shown to be important criteria for orientation.	0.829540134013707
Special interest is focussed on allergic diseases and atrophic conditions as causes of eyelid swelling.	0.3664956788831353
A 74-year-old man suffered from symptoms of a left upper lobe pneumonia.	0.7168251847335871
Additional retrosternal masses were proved.	0.11623552549565935
Progression in the left upper lobe occurred in spite of antibiotic therapy; infiltrations of the right lower lobe were seen.	0.7161445324109041
No germs could be identified.	0.25904767757075314
Bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy showed no pathological findings.	0.27742245313596875
His general health became worse, and the patient died under the clinical diagnosis of "wandering pneumonia" with finally suspicion of fulminant pulmonary artery embolism.	0.831107682862395
Autopsy findings revealed an advanced stage of pulmonary artery sarcoma with myocardial infiltration and metastases in both kidneys and thyroid gland.	0.4759917952433588
General manifestation of pulmonary artery sarcoma usually are symptoms similar to those caused by pulmonary artery embolism with obstruction of pulmonary arterial flow.	0.549255382861516
The unusual constellation of clinical findings similar to colliquating pneumonia results in secondary infection due to tumorous pulmonary infarction.	0.3473038253469782
The difficulties in diagnosis by biopsy are caused by primary intravascular growth of the neoplasms.	0.5485963389874187
Therefore early diagnosis in an operable tumor stage by means of CT, MR, and angiography is very important.	0.6814683097479839
Definition of the problem: Is it the brain that makes a human being a person?	0.445099957007588
This anthropological question has been raised because of the findings of modern human brain research, and there are severe ethical consequences anew: If the appropriate anthropological answer is yes, then all invasive research would be problematic, because one would touch the basis of human essence.	0.6522804973210399
The problem is that the two major philosophical paradigms that offer an answer to the anthropological question, dualism and monism, have opposing concepts.	0.5492464104445925
Arguments: This paper argues that the error of these two paradigms is that they understand the human body and the human mind as 'res' - as things.	0.7711950347525887
The explanation of the human being as an interactive unit of body and mind is impossible in both paradigms.	0.5662984730001434
A third anthropological view that tries to make that understandable is the anthropology of the Hebrew Bible.	0.3098523494463406
It does assume the category 'thing' while speaking about humans, it presumes the category 'aspect'.	0.47326050486231047
There is no Hebrew word for 'mind' in contrast to 'body' or vice versa.	0.42880651890805244
The biblical language only knows terms for the unity of human beings seen under a certain aspect.	0.36815577766122565
Conclusion: Here, the body and thus the brain are important and necessary condition for human essence, but this is not a sufficient explanation for the human personality.	0.7949060394643059
Invasive research on the human brain is here neither generally forbidden nor tolerated - one has to demonstrate in every single case whether the planned operation touches regions that are crucial for the personality of the human subject.	0.6080334382643071
Introduction: In recent studies we identified two morphological phenomena in the facial nucleus of the brainstem that play an important role in the recovery of facial movement: hyperinnervation and misdirected reinnervation.	0.6222298427360806
While the hyperinnervation could easily be quantified by cell counting, the extent of misdirected reinnervation could not be estimated accurately.	0.5017195566161864
In the present study we developed a method for accurate quantification of this misdirected reinnervation.	0.7020720385735575
A 50 year old female patient received anaesthesia of the arm by the vertical infraclavicular blockade of the plexus brachialis (VIP).	0.5525676582111799
Postoperatively an ipsilateral pneumothorax occured complicated by pleural effusion and a contralateral bronchopneumonia, which resolved completely after treatment.	0.4979123429613436
The blockade of the plexus was performed correctly, failures in determining the correct point of needle insertion could be excluded.	0.4975481702142006
Therefore a pneumothorax has to be regarded as a specific complication of the VIP, which might occur despite correct technique, and requires that the patient be informed of this eventuality.	0.7088490686393262
Nevertheless, the VIP is an important method due to its high success rate concerning blockade of the musculocutaneous nerve and tolerance of tourniquet.	0.6953792408957054
The risk of a pneumothorax is about 0.2 to 0.7%.	0.82228490184121
The routine application of ultrasound in pregnancy has had an important impact on perinatal medicine.	0.5155126498275442
New trends in perinatal medicine, aiming at more individual and self-determined pregnancy and delivery, are realizable because of the safety provided by ultrasound.	0.5367326343274305
Often prenatal ultrasound is regarded as only being able to detect fetal malformations, but ultrasound provides many more benefits for a safe pregnancy: early detection of fetal viability; intrauterine localization of the pregnancy; exact determination of the gestational age in early pregnancy; later in pregnancy, confirmation of appropriate fetal growth, position and localization of placenta site.	0.5726124824873084
In addition, the development of close mother-child bonding by visualizing the fetus could be of positive impact.	0.47348806707075486
These aspects are contributions of ultrasound to a gentle and safe pregnancy and delivery for mother and child.	0.4926021283661262
For routine evaluation of ureteropelvic junction obstruction in children, sonography, voiding cystogram, IV pyelogram and a renal scan in combination with administration of furosemide are available.	0.4869761973653181
Furthermore, often preoperative antegrade or retrograde ureteropyelography is performed.	0.4666254561721553
However, the significance of retrograde ureteropyelography in the world literature remains controversial.	0.6193028881646405
Therefore, we reviewed the records of 41 children who underwent a pyeloplasty in our department.	0.728050710269382
In 9 children the ureter was visualized by IV pyelogram, voiding cystogram or antegrade ureteropyelography; a retrograde examination of the ureter was performed in 21 children before pyeloplasty in the OR.	0.5437968563208394
In 11 children the ureter was not visualized preoperatively.	0.3003824766823724
Retrograde ureterography neither gave additional information in any patient nor did it change the operative technique.	0.47779602578378416
In the children where the ureter was not visualized preoperatively, no ureteric abnormality was found in association with ureteropelvic junction obstruction.	0.5675519193723473
Hence, we conclude that retrograde ureteropyelography before pyeloplasty in children is not necessary, provided that sonography does not show ureteral dilatation.	0.6761097360310535
We report on a patient with multicentric juvenile xanthogranuloma, whose unusual clinical and histological pattern initially obscured the diagnosis.	0.5815325606588997
Spontaneous remission of the tumour, which has now been maintained for over 2 years, the change from the primary monomorphological fibrocytic appearance to a polymorphological histiocytic picture with multiple fat-storing giant cells, and the lacking demonstration of specific cell organelles finally allowed the nature of the disease to the definitely diagnosed.	0.7119771504796744
In children with horseshoe kidneys Wilms' tumors can be observed 2 to 8-times more often.	0.5831043894204486
Wilms' tumors are malignant mixed tissue tumors that seldom show large parts of fatty tissue.	0.36773849345805354
We report about a 28-month-old girl with an unusual Wilms' tumor in a horseshoe kidney which according to radiological criteria could have been a teratoma because of its large lipomatous part with internal calcifications.	0.5941860711011817
The radiological characteristics of these differential diagnoses are presented in different cross-section imagings.	0.48755204692998366
Both differential diagnostic considerations correlated with the histologic diagnosis of a teratoid Wilms'tumor.	0.580493781875478
Gene therapy in orthopedic surgery is a new technic based on the idea of biological tissue healing.	0.6835862690046235
External gene segments are transferred to cells that overexpress growth factors locally to achieve this effect.	0.3951791628273381
The influence of growth factors on fracture healing is very well documented in the literature.	0.6645174747416381
Experimental data demonstrate that defect healing in bone can be accelerated by the application of different cytokines in vivo.	0.44352936292827555
Gene transfer is a promising, new technic of in situ tissue engineering that will enter clinics within the next decade.	0.6390554485774966
Biomechanical investigations of the mandible are difficult to perform due to a variety of conditions involved.	0.66517376049447
For the appropriate reconstruction of biomechanical properties, a geometrically correct body model has to be established which fits to complex in vivo conditions.	0.6305615863274989
The aim of our study was to evaluate the use of finite-element models (FEM) for the assessment of mandibular deformation under mechanical loading.	0.5855984294297477
Explanted human mandibles (n = 5) were investigated by strain gauges to determine the individual strain distribution under mechanical loading.	0.6343038856889575
FEM analysis based on a computed tomograph (CT) was performed and the results were matched with the test data.	0.7917898789315695
Our study demonstrates only minor interindividual differences in the strain distribution for each load studied.	0.4500377947224149
The mechanical response in terms of deformation was found to depend mainly on gross geometrical properties and to a minor extent on the various other variables.	0.5476768001807119
At all positions the maximum principal strain was tensile, the minimum principal strain was compressive, and the absolute strain values were correlated with the magnitude of the applied force.	0.6491695535683956
CT-based FEM analysis revealed the utility of mathematical models to approximate simulated data our experimental results.	0.34277789338852993
Hence, FEM analysis is a non-invasive tool in the prediction of biomechanical behaviour of individual mandibles and therefore may help in trauma reconstruction and treatment planning.	0.6156273604757003
Acrodysostosis is a rare syndrome characterized by growth retardation and peripheral dysostosis.	0.5595194325850903
70% of affected patients exhibit mental retardation.	0.6444313891785739
Inheritance occurs in an autosomal-dominant pattern.	0.4948463721631364
The genetic defect is not known.	0.5215879688236795
Therapeutic strategies in the treatment of pancreatic carcinoma are based on the high number of non-resectable cancers, the high relative radioresistance and the high distant metastases rate.	0.7181806231723412
Even in curatively resected carcinomas, a locally effective treatment modality is needed because of the risk of microscopical residual disease in the peripancreatic tissue.	0.5545606392834993
The efficacy of radiotherapy is dose dependent.	0.368728407432704
Based on an analysis of published data a dose of more than 50 Gy is recommended, resulting in a high morbidity rate with external beam radiotherapy alone.	0.7445760613607663
The use of intraoperative radiotherapy allows locally restricted dose escalation without increased perioperative morbidity.	0.3917908330291157
In adjuvant and in primary treatment, local tumor contol was improved (70-90 %).	0.6205610771924218
With palliative intent, pain relief was obtained rapidly in over 60 % of patients and led to improved patient performance.	0.8036716337625254
As a result of the high distant metastases rate, even in curatively resected carcinomas, the overall prognosis could not be significantly improved.	0.8100459618325345
Further dose escalation is limited by the increasing incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (20-30 %).	0.6237083789696654
Malignant tumors of the head and neck region are amongst the six most often occurring tumors of the body.	0.6066425497921273
They can be associated with the different anatomical compartments as well as different histologic types.	0.6606122069105431
The way of tumor spread of these malignancies depends on their histologic type and on the region.	0.5949522705893304
These compartments can be separated into the nasopharynx, the oropharynx, and the hypopharynx.	0.7174734414896431
Most of the malignant tumors belong to the squamous cell carcinomas, other histologic types are depicted less frequently.	0.6299111944350383
The histologic types of the other groups which are seen more often comprise of lymphomas and adenoidcystic carcinomas.	0.5243989049121388
The undifferentiated carcinoma of the nasopharynx is supposed to be a special type of tumor.	0.6322152084113253
The malignant tumors of the pharynx can also involve all three compartments.	0.5227772332669922
Beside these tumors, malignancies of mesenchymal origin can also be delineated.	0.3915986104642656
While there are quite a number of reports on vascular injuries complicating hip arthropasty by acetabular component screw fixation, retractor tip pressure or extruding bone cement, the incidence of deep femoral vessel injuries in operative fixation of proximal femoral fractures is comparatively seldom described.	0.4949447327310532
We report on two patients with per- and subtrochanteric femoral fractures who sustained injuries of deep femoral artery branches during the implantation of a dynamic hip screw (DHS) and a dynamic condylar screw (DCS), which resulted in a massive thigh hematoma and a fist-size pseudoaneurysm respectively and necessitated surgical intervention in either case.	0.6710819466119738
We blame these vascular injuries on the pressure of Hohmann retractors exposing the femoral bone or on the drilling of boreholes for plate attachement.	0.3985395669532632
After discussing various operative procedures, we conclude that intramedullar implants are safer than plates with regard to potential vascular complications.	0.45773225291833186
Cleft lip and palates (CLP) are caused by a variety of factors.	0.5745796418355111
Ionizing radiation is only one of these factors.	0.6879589549322851
The meltdown of the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl on April 26, 1986, and the subsequent radioactive fallout did not cause any acute radiation sickness in Germany.	0.5487594657270819
Nevertheless, in West Berlin a significant increase of trisomy-21 cases was reported in births 9 months after the Chernobyl reactor accident.	0.682406106560464
In our study we analyzed the influence of the radioactive fallout after the Chernobyl disaster on the rate and regional distribution of CLP newborns in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR).	0.6112954563675065
In contrast to the Federal Republic of Germany an ongoing malformation register for CLP newborns had existed in the former GDR since 4 July 1967.	0.46038643172909466
Environmental data were collected from national and international environmental authorities and atomic energy agencies.	0.4272348932720016
Population statistics were taken from the statistical yearbook of the former GDR.	0.4933206531590909
During a 10-year period from 1980 to 1989, the average number of CLP newborns in the GDR was 1.88 per 1,000 live births.	0.7085584540018898
A significant prevalence increase was recorded in 1983, 1987 und 1988.	0.40269353337417796
In comparison to the mean rate in the period from 1980 until 1986, 1987 demonstrated an increase of 9.4%.	0.74347769088826
Regional prevalence increases were seen in the three northern districts of Schwerin, Rostock and Neubrandenburg, where the radioactivity measurements in general showed higher levels of the radionuclides caesium-137 und strontium-90 than in other districts.	0.5215629989872663
Owing to the comprehensive malformation register for CLP patients in the GDR, this is the first study for Germany, analyzing the CLP rate before and after the fallout in Chernobyl.	0.6933289297976493
The results support the allegation of the influence of radiation-induced increase of CLP newborns after the Chernobyl reactor accident.	0.43791818125883475
The median survival time for patients with disseminated malignant melanoma is 5-7 months; it is still not really known whether therapeutic measures prolong survival.	0.7372643299568404
The aim of the present investigation was to identify patients with prolonged survival in stage IV disease and to analyse the possible impact of therapy on the course of the disease.	0.7526103595941476
in the Department of Dermatology, Benjamin Franklin University Medical Centre at the Free University of Berlin, 263 patients with were diagnosed as having stage IV melanoma and enrolled in a computer-based registry between 1970 and 1993.	0.44937307678812544
In 89 cases systemic medical mentous treatment was given and 111 patients underwent surgery and/or radiation therapy.	0.5262678290307894
There were 48 patients who received both systemic and local therapy.	0.6381585483839797
On the other hand, 111 patients received no treatment.	0.32374133660983734
Twenty two patients were identified survived longer than 24 months (median survival time 33 months).	0.7314955947042625
None of the patients who had received no treatment survived for 2 years or longer.	0.8823293648931699
The 22 patients with prolonged survival were treated by multimodality included 16 who had received both systemic treatment and surgery and/or radiation, while 3 had had only systemic drug therapy and another 3, only local treatment.	0.71402702045852
Twelve of the 22 patients became tumour free after their initial surgery or radiation.	0.401581862039745
Active therapy in disseminated melanoma with reduction of tumour mass by surgery and radiation and with systemic medical treatment may lead to prolonged survival in a considerable percentage of patients.	0.5421583695063931
Background: The use of intravenous heparin is essential for the treatment of unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction.	0.7235286276757877
A significant rebound of thrombin generation within 6 to 10 hours after termination of heparin infusion has been reported.	0.45971778618443737
This time window is clinically critical as the incidence of recurrent ischemia peaks in this period.	0.4648556913614171
It has therefore been recommended to gradually taper heparin infusion continously rather than to discontinue it abruptly.	0.46009098230804096
However, it is not known which dosing procedure is useful and whether it definitly reduces thrombin rebound.	0.6457975059939262
The use of porcine skin as a biomedical model for the human integument is discussed with reference to the literature.	0.6490101480928224
The epidermis and dermis can be used as a model as there are clear structural, functional and biochemical similarities with human skin layers.	0.5969111391393429
The actual utilization of porcine skin in dermatological research is reviewed.	0.3737072858243717
Practical difficulties are emphasized: in particular, the conditions required for use of porcine skin in experimental research, the most suitable breeds, and restrictions on biological interpretation of the results.	0.7723995252948582
Laparoscopic procedures have attained increasing importance in the diagnosis and therapy of carcinoma of the cervix in recent years (Table 1) [34].	0.9004112509449372
Laparoscopic pelvic and para-aortal lymphadenectomies are therefore performed to assess the operability of carcinoma of the cervix and for its staging.	0.5295094091546306
In the case of primarily operable tumours, paraortal and pelvic lymphadenectomy is carried out by a laparoscopic procedure, and when the lymph nodes are negative nodes and there is no intra-abdominal metastasis the lymphadenectomy is combined with laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy.	0.6583420535125678
If laparoscopy discloses positive lymph nodes, debulking can be carried out and the patient can be referred for radiotherapy.	0.4942323050286067
In addition, laparoscopic procedures, even in combination with radical cervicectomy for early invasive carcinoma of the cervix, can mean conservation of the patient's fertility.	0.7426197655244551
In the case of primarily inoperable tumours laparoscopy can be used to assess the lymph node status and the intra-abdominal tumour spread and to classify the patient's condition as potentially secondarily operable or inoperable.	0.7262185123627715
In addition, in the case of primarily undertreated patients whose carcinoma of the cervix has been diagnosed incidentally in preparations of tissue examined following hysterectomy, posttreatment in the form of laparoscopic lymphadenectomy and laparoscopically assisted colpectomy can be performed.	0.5577911163180658
The efficacy of buprenorphine in opioid dependent patients (n=20) was compared to methadone maintained subjects (n=20) in a randomized comparison trial.	0.7478257184672454
Sublingual application of buprenorphine as an alternative synthetical opioid is being compared to methadone during a 24 week study period.	0.4696634576250394
A trend (p=0.06) could be found in the retention rate of investigated patients being maintained on a mean dosage of 63 mg oral applicable methadone (racemat of L- and D-methadone) in comparison to the group on a mean dosage of 7,3 mg buprenorphine (sublingual tablets).	0.6113225035207237
The dropout-rate of 11 subjects at the end of the study in the buprenorphine group was higher when compared to the dropout-rate of 5 in the methadone group.	0.6430160876347113
There was no significant difference between the two groups over the treatment period in respect to additional consumption of opiates, benzodiazepines and cocaine as evaluated through urine toxicology.	0.5042946036183289
The result in regard to compliance over the study period demonstrates that methadone appears to be the more successful oral opioid (p=0,04).	0.6495280051994794
Nevertheless, efficacy of buprenorphine in maintenance could be demonstrated in the remaining subjects, and further studies with higher daily doses and a higher number of subjects have to be performed.	0.8004042425999053
In patients with pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma, surgery is a technically difficult procedure.	0.6216212760316837
Whereas those rare forms of localized pleural mesotheliomy are being detected incidentally and can be cured by complete resection, most patients with diffuse malignant mesothelioma present with an advanced stage of disease.	0.5992836518340806
Most of these patients survive less than 12 months irrespective of the treatment modality.	0.8345195256751192
For diffuse pleural mesothelioma, some favorable prognostic factors were identified: IMIG (International Mesothelioma Interest Group), stages I and II, epithelial type, age under 50, female gender.	0.601330619889612
In IMIG stages I and II, extended pleuropneumonectomy followed by chemo- and/or radiotherapy is recommended.	0.4920037561418114
For this subset of patients, a median survival time of between 20 and 30 months is reported.	0.6592579115223764
Pleurectomy and decortication are recommended as palliative surgical strategies against pleural effusion.	0.34083748004179226
In patients with technically inoperable infiltration of the thoracic wall, irradiation is helpful; sometimes partial remission and relief of pain can be achieved by chemotherapy.	0.6024648917063502
Fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG) registers the magnetic field generated by the fetal heart.	0.33976816439417995
In contrast to the fetal elctrocardiogram, fECG permits non-invasive registration of fetal heart activity and documentation of all parts of the PQRST-wave-forms from the second trimenon onwards.	0.5482576239879963
This facilitates the determination of cardiac time intervals and establishment of reference values for different stages of pregnancy.	0.4893631514423769
We examined 53 women in 104 recordings from the 10th week of gestation onwards (1 to 10 recordings per individual).	0.5543988658768102
The fMCG (37 magnetic channels, sampling rate 1024 Hz, bandwidth 1-200Hz) was recorded non-invasively over the mother's abdomen in a magnetically shielded room.	0.4882897394319587
Registration of fetal heart beats was generally successful from the 20/21th week of gestation onwards.	0.48986086372794957
In a few cases, fetal heart beats could be registered as early as in the 16th week.	0.7121661004765895
Cardiac time intervals and amplitudes of fMCG increased concordantly with fetal growth.	0.2776761153681547
Mean P wave duration increased from 31 to 49 ms (p < 0.05), PQ interval from 95 to 107 ms (n. s.) and QRS duration from 36 to 52 ms (p < 0.01).	0.5123909002706518
The mean amplitudes of the P and R waves also increased.	0.37830091736969984
To demonstrate imaging findings in inflammatory diseases of the pharynx and possible complications.	0.591691297971525
The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyse the complications of our arthroscopic procedures at the ankle joint.	0.6932961458145027
In all patients we evaluated the treatment protocols and in 111 patients (79,3%) we also evaluated the clinical and radiologic results.	0.7879949944012812
All in all we have found complications in 14 patients.	0.41721603601380725
In 4 cases we have seen a delayed wound healing, in 2 cases a superficial infection, in 3 cases a deep infection, in 3 cases a neural damage and in 2 cases a phlebothrombosis.	0.8698486858925878
Our study show, that the complication rate could be minimized by detailed knowledge of the anatomy, exact preoperative diagnostic and planing of the operation and careful preparation of the portals.	0.7343433236212471
The use of a laser also shows a tendency to a lower complication rate.	0.6666554403126521
Airbag inflation is associated with a loud noise.	0.446508010319315
This very short noise has a peak amplitude of 170 dB sound pressure level and can make otologic injuries.	0.3680223801911859
We report a case of acoustic trauma after airbag inflation.	0.49774566678536925
The 24-year-old man has hearing loss both side in the 3000- to 6000-Hz range and in the deep-frequency.	0.6547726555680117
The possibility of acoustic trauma from airbag noise are probably much more common and need more attention in the clinic.	0.49419009705949146
The incidence of primary malignant neoplasms of the pleura, the pericardium and the peritoneum in Germany has been rising since about the mid-1980 s. A continuing rise is expected until about 2020, predominantly due to the peak of asbestos processing in Germany between 1965 and 1980.	0.5697642008716437
About 90 % of the mesotheliomas stored in the files of the German Mesothelioma Registry in Bochum are asbestos related and therefore possibly due to occupational exposure that may be compensated by the professional associations.	0.5620928911019437
More than 500 mesotheliomas annually can be diagnosed in the German Mesothelioma Registry.	0.7412441940234153
In this first part of the series on mesotheliomas, current concepts on etiology and pathogenesis as well as diagnostic procedures and standards are discussed.	0.6520551174907793
At the present, specific chromosomal or genetic defects that constantly give rise to a mesothelioma are not known.	0.5643685400083684
The initiation and progression of malignant mesotheliomas is a highly complex mechanism that is based on individual genetic alterations.	0.4956256500346791
A reliable diagnosis is the basis for therapeutic, prognostic and medicolegal conseques; in general, it can be achieved by thoracoscopic inspection with selected biopsy.	0.7669596192578143
Surgery may gain a more important role in the therapy of malignant tumors of serosal membranes not only in palliative, but also in potential curative approaches if the diagnosis can be made at earlier tumor stages.	0.7837896420686131
Acute gastrointestinal bleeding is a life threatening disease with a mortality rate of 10%.	0.7735350135380724
Upper gastrointestinal bleeding occurs more frequent (85%) and more severe compared to lower gastrointestinal bleeding.	0.6668835846993356
The medical history may be helpful in the diagnosis of the bleeding source.	0.8555914632772306
Prognosis and mortality are dependent on intensity of bleeding, reflected by clinical signs such as shock, hemoglobin level, transfused blood units, hematemesis, presence of comorbidity and age of the patient.	0.5865832093361293
Furthermore rebleeding is associated with an increased mortality.	0.6977447081495725
Therefore one major goal in the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding is to avoid rebleeding.	0.4872885153887104
Joints are innervated by nociceptive nerve fibres (nociceptors), which are only activated by tissue-damaging stimuli.	0.5649986350882998
This activation causes pain in conscious humans.	0.22361104250634734
The sensory terminals of many nociceptors in the tissue are sensitized by inflammatory processes.	0.38508929134086445
Under these conditions, normally innocuous and non-painful stimuli are sufficient to activate nociceptors and to elicit pain.	0.39610463008635044
The effect of inflammatory mediators such as bradykinin and prostaglandins is important for the process of sensitization.	0.5255279078598881
In addition to their sensory function, many nociceptors have an efferent function.	0.6275442043077942
They evoke a neurogenic inflammation by the release of neuropeptides such as substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide into the tissue.	0.3683895563205404
The efferent function of nociceptors contributes to the generation of inflammatory lesions of the tissue.	0.5028896806810075
Autolyzed, antigen-extracted, allogeneic bone (AAA bone) is prepared from cortical bones of human organ donors.	0.4812657313092166
AAA bone possesses osteoinductive properties as it delivers BMPs from its bone matrix.	0.27724315356556145
Within a prospective study, 37 cranial defects were reconstructed using AAA bone implants over a period of more than 7 years.	0.597159844118569
The patients were followed-up at standardized intervals.	0.7343681779847759
Roentgenographic assessments and bone scintigraphies revealed osseous integration and remodelling of the AAA bone implants.	0.3412353336687797
In one quarter of the cases re-entry was performed 10 to 18 months after the cranioplasty (removal of osteosynthesis material, recurrence of tumor).	0.6180702911402496
All nine AAA bone reconstructions showed bleeding surfaces and bony integrations.	0.2647840593555527
A bone biopsy was taken from the center of one of these AAA bone implants and this showed new bone formation originating from the surface of the implant.	0.6724950541780362
In one case an AAA bone implant was lost due to infection.	0.46475308341407295
This is noteworthy as in approximately one third of the cases the bone implants were in direct contact with the frontal sinus.	0.7203717858966714
The clinical results clearly emphasize the therapeutical benefit of AAA bone for cranioplasties.	0.4516334483524282
Large AAA bone chips from human skull bones facilitate the reconstruction of the skull's convexity, especially when sterolithography-based operation planning is performed.	0.5517609382546337
Saphenous vein harvesting remains a 20 % source of morbidity in patients who require lower extremity bypass or coronary artery bypass grafting.	0.601571005029016
In an attempt to reduce the complications associated with this procedure, minimally invasive video-assisted vein harvesting is propagated.	0.5255732066757492
The technique uses currently available endoscopic equipment with mechanical retraction to dissect the great saphenous vein with two limited incisions.	0.33795317259781876
The dissection is visualized on the video monitor to isolate and control side branches by clips.	0.31353945644795717
The vein is removed for reverse arterial bypass grafting or dissection is completed for an in situ bypass procedure.	0.4797371697092537
Initial experience with ten patients undergoing peripheral bypass procedures showed a mean vein-preparation time of 60 min.	0.4067321531823304
Two of seven in situ bypass procedures were complicated by side branch damage controlled through longer skin incision.	0.3878060876468765
After a mean follow-up of 12 months, all bypasses are patent.	0.7943297163888772
Taking our own experience as well as that reported in the literature into consideration, aspects of cost-effectiveness are discussed.	0.6695054560342958
Obstructions of the nasolacrimal duct occur frequently (70%) in term newborns and are symptomatic in 6%.	0.6112347580527387
The reason is an incomplete canalization and differentiation of the lacrimal duct during the fetal period.	0.5795339670821127
A persisting membran between the duct and the nasal cavity at the level of the valve of Hasner in combination with a proximal valvelike obstruction at the junction of the lacrimal canal and sac may cause a dacryocystocele by fluid accumulation.	0.537930291542852
We describe a term newborn with a bilateral dacryocystocele and respiratory distress.	0.4597428568478574
The recognition of a medical discipline on a European level as an independent specialty depends on its registration in the medical directives of the European Union.	0.5812607857917174
With supreme effort, the oral and maxillofacial surgeons of the EU reached this goal in 1989.	0.5927645902374189
The UEMS - Section of Stomatology and Oromaxillofacial Surgery - became the forum for discussion of the relevant problems with representatives of the member states and officials of the European Commission.	0.5331531747254024
Thanks to its activities, oral and maxillofacial surgery is now recognized as an independent specialty with about 3800 specialists in 11 European countries.	0.49503206661974936
A biatrial pacemaker was inserted in a 68-year-old female with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter refractory to antiarrhythmic drugs based on a sick-sinus-syndrome and concomitant interatrial conduction delay.	0.5925750951798796
One electrode positioned in the right atrium and another electrode located in the coronary sinus were connected to a dual-chamber pacemaker.	0.6251893299842856
The electrode in the right atrium was connected to the atrial channel, the electrode in the coronary sinus to the ventricular channel.	0.6858851568431155
The pacemaker was programmed in DDD-mode with an AV-delay of 30 ms.	0.4725370151305871
Under a chronic antiarrhythmic medication with 160 mg sotalol per day there was no evidence for recurrent episodes of atrial tachyarrhythmias in the patient's history, 24-h-Holter-ECG, nor in the memory of the pacemaker during a follow-up of 8 months.	0.7193401845670508
The AB0 blood types, first discovered by Karl Landsteiner in 1901, can be genotyped with the PCR method of Lee and Chang [6].	0.4001499236704116
Using two primer pairs, allele-specific sequences can be amplified and, after digestion with restriction endonucleases, visualized by silver staining on a polyacrylamide gel.	0.42134670048125533
In a southwest German population the allele frequencies were: Allele A = 0.2704, allele B = 0.0741 and allele 0 = 0.6556.	0.40410575378231695
With the method of Lee and Chang [6] only the nucleotide positions 261 and 703 are considered so that out of 280 individuals 10 (3.57%) showed differences between the AB0 genotype and phenotype, because it was not possible to differentiate between A and 02 alleles.	0.6969096711390426
Based on the one experience and the information that is available in the literature indications for ankle arthroscopy are given, surgical equipment, patient placement and surgical technique of different procedures are described.	0.837463469163604

Removal of loose bodies as well as synovectomies in case of an acute infection or rheumatoid arthritis are good indication.	0.5718569131348629
Arthroscopic treatment of anterior pathology in the athletic ankle need a thorough diagnostic work-up; the results of the treatment do not always meet the expectations of this especially demanding population.	0.6324315546310634
Cartilage treatment is technically possible, however, long term results are still missing.	0.6846315261481675
This is also true for the treatment on osteochondritis dissecans.	0.746648827416917
In patients with degenerative joint disease arthroscopic debridement can only lead to a temporary benefit.	0.5572495896364189
Arthroscopic assisted arthrodeses (AAA) is technically demanding, but can serve as an excellent alternative to conventional open techniques.	0.7952836961554656
The complication rate in ankle arthroscopy is high compared to other joints, which is especially true for neurologic complications and postoperative infections.	0.6975654561413586
This should be addressed when performing the informed consent.	0.32217892520840247
Recent prospective randomised trials dealed with the optimal extent of surgical resection as well as with preoperative therapy modalities in pancreatic, rectal and breast cancer.	0.48703858621241214
In pancreatic cancer extended lymphadenectomy did not improve overall survival.	0.42278019271546996
Total mesorectal excision remarkably changed surgery for rectal cancer.	0.24167149431836119
Rate of local recurrence of rectal cancer could be significantly reduced by preoperative irradiation.	0.5981281440599453
In advanced rectal cancers curative resection and sphincter preservation seems possible due to multimodal preoperative therapy.	0.3030424002198158
It has been demonstrated that in appropriate cases breastpreserving resection is comparable to mastectomy with respect to overall survival.	0.6012957134756797
Up to now it is not quite clear if sentinel node sampling is equivalent to routine lymphadenectomy.	0.5568293088568518
Following neoadjuvant chemotherapy breastpreservation rate is significantly higher, but survival is not significantly increased.	0.6421706087987401
Introduction and Methods: A 0.5 T open-configuration MR system allows free access to the patient via a 58-cm-wide opening on both sides of the machine.	0.6718874223987031
A newly developed system for needle guidance enables the examiner to perform biopsies in combination with real-time imaging and to position laser fibers in the human body.	0.5455005038951857
For imaging, a 2D gradient echo sequence is used (TR 19 ms, TE 9 ms, flip angle 30  °, FOV 24 x 24 cm, slice thickness 10 mm matrix 256 x 128).	0.47634133749973123
The acquired images are displayed on two LCD screens localized within the MR system, thus allowing an interactive needle guidance.	0.4857971309905449
This procedure is illustrated by a case report.	0.6857616773879224
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are established drugs for the treatment of patients with heart failure and hypertension.	0.5140897634303391
There is mounting evidence to suggest that ACE inhibitors may be used for different indications as well.	0.5415258407485942
The rational for the use of ACE inhibitors is to block the vasoconstrictive effects mediated by angiotensin II.	0.428723384639426
The hemodynamic profile of ACE inhibitors is modified by additional effects such as interference with the degredation of bradykinin and accumulation of prostaglandin and nitric oxide (NO).	0.39655155163667544
Thus ACE inhibitors may be successful in preventing the negative effects of vasoconstriction on regional circulation.	0.45284895978404466
Since vasoconstriction, particularly of the mesenteric vasculature appears to be largely mediated by the renin-angiotensin-axis, ACE inhibitors are assumed to be effective in treating or avoiding gut mucosal hypoperfusion.	0.5291755537164008
The critically ill intensive care patient at risk of developing multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is still a major therapeutic challenge.	0.7294391188677893
Intravenous preparations of ACE inhibitors may broaden our therapeutic armamentarium for these patients.	0.4628746574678702
However, several questions about the exact mechanisms of ACE inhibitors, such as the ideal substance and the optimal dose, are still open.	0.7824895823290329
Moreover, further work needs to be done to definitely determine whether ACE inhibitors may be helpful to prevent or treat (micro-) circulatory catastrophe in these patients.	0.6389406869951444
The pharmacologic properties of ACE inhibitors provide an exciting stepping stone for future research in this field.	0.48420515719163976
Hypoparathyroidism (HP) results from deficient parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, pseudohypoparathyreoidism (PHP) results form decreased PTH action on its target organs.	0.4319476486257376
Between May 1996 and 1999, a total of 186 endoscopic spinal operations were performed to treat unstable injuries and pathologic fractures.	0.5917747440212154
The operative spinal interventions followed the classic sequence of excision of part of a vertebral body, partial replacement of the vertebral body with bone harvested from the iliac crest, and implantation of a titanium plate to stabilize the part to be fused.	0.6362102438741293
In 62% of these cases we performed primary dorsal straightening with a fixateur interne.	0.8248096396519708
The serious complications were aortic leakage and deep infection in the area of the graft and the implant, each of which occurred in 1 case.	0.7191008927134392
Comparisons with the literature showed approximately the same rate of spinal complications as with open surgery, while the rate of morbidity connected with the surgical approach was reduced to a third in the patient population treated endoscopically, with correspondingly positive implications for the postoperative analgesic requirement and for convalescence.	0.7609649209551516
Various risk scores have been developed for the assessment of operative risk in cardiac surgery.	0.6673117345270374
Although risk stratification has been acknowledged as a useful tool to analyze trends in therapy and changes in patient populations, its relevance in assessing the indication for surgery has been questioned.	0.6863448060352807
It was the goal of this prospective study to compare 6 common risk scores with regard to the predictive value for mortality in individual patients.	0.7047299624242456
Between September 1998 and February 1999 all adult patients undergoing heart surgery were prospectively scored according to the following scores: initial Parsonnet, Cleveland Clinic, French, Euro, Pons, and the Ontario Province Risk score.	0.5393405325370565
Early lethality was assessed within 30 days postoperatively.	0.2823340058534276
Follow-up was completed in 504 patients.	0.6453625228500419
With the exception of the Ontario Province Risk score, lethality in the high risk group was overestimated by all scores, whereas lethality in low to moderate risk groups was underestimated by several scores.	0.6190168980186584
Mean scores of surviving and deceased patients showed a broad overlap with high standard deviations.	0.44784181048506483
Preoperative risk scores are effective tools for stratification of patient populations and the analysis of surgical outcome.	0.43767926875811447
With the aid of risk scores, operative risk can be sufficiently predicted for patient populations or subpopulations.	0.6051629023000636
The Euro score best predicted the outcome of our patients.	0.5280091247071027
However, when the indication for surgery is to be determined in an individual patient, risk scores should be only considered as an orientation in the decision process.	0.8969266754050368
Background and objective: A complicated course of erysipelas is not uncommon.	0.5227682337112901
Bullous, haemorrhagic, necrotic and purulent lesions may be encountered.	0.3012357806421327
Today no reliable data exist as to which constitutional factors renders a patient at risk for developing complicated erysipelas though several risk factors, particularly diabetes mellitus, are often suggested.	0.561766513263721
Based on the analysis of patients with erysipelas at the Department of Dermatology in Graz, factors determining the risk for complicated erysipelas should be identified.	0.7155893784501638
Patients/Methods: In a retrospective case-control study clinical data sheets of 766 in- patients treated at the department were evaluated with respect to the course of the erysipelas and with respect to potential risk factors.	0.7805160850268532
Results: General risk factors for local complications were location at the lower extremities, pre-existing hepatic or renal disease, hyperuricaemia, and diabetes mellitus.	0.6844418921368148
Hepatic and renal disease and - to a lesser extent - diabetes particularly predisposed for bullous and haemorrhagic lesions, while vascular occlusive disease enhanced the risk for ne- crotic lesions.	0.661218434097522
Conclusions: Location and hepatic and renal disease are the most important risk factors, while diabetes is probably of less significance than previously suggested.	0.7012799928825595
Patients with end-stage liver disease frequently develop combined coagulopathies due to increased procoagulant and fibrinolytic turnover as well as thrombocytopenia.	0.45205505522594125
The onset of clinical symptoms of a haemorrhagic diathesis requires balanced substitution of coagulation factors, since fresh frozen plasma alone does not always maintain a sufficient haemostatic potential in these patients.	0.572358875247265
This substitution commonly follows standard rules based on the assumption that 0.5 - 1 IU of a coagulation factor or inhibitor concentrate given per kg body weight will increase its endogenous activity by 1%.	0.6008943645213838
We set out to investigate the validity of this standard regime in patients with end-stage liver disease scheduled for orthotopic liver transplantation.	0.5423021092807311
Fifty-one adult patients were prospectively studied.	0.477476940306249
In 37 patients with antithrombin III (AT III) activity <70%, an AT III preparation (Kybernin, Behring, Marburg, Germany) was given preoperatively (mean dose 2616 +/- 207 IU) following standard calculations in order to increase endogenous activity to 80%.	0.6615928132792057
Twenty-seven of the patients had chronic hepatic failure (CHF group) with histologically proven cirrhosis and 10 had acute hepatic failure (AHF group).	0.7197229389277627
Blood samples were drawn prior to a 15-min infusion of AT III concentrate and 30 min thereafter.	0.6391174983694665
In 14 patients with prothrombin time (PT) <40%, AT III levels had been corrected earlier during the clinical course to achieve activities >70%.	0.7335844568577514
Prothrombin complex (PPSB, Beriplex, Behring, Marburg, Germany) was substituted (mean dose 2304 +/- 289 IU) to increase procoagulant activity to PT >60%.	0.5819526620349971
Blood samples were drawn in the same fashion as in the AT III group.	0.7189469385146441
The amounts of AT III and PPSB concentrates ( AT III, [IU/kg];  PPSB [IU/kg]) required to increase AT III activity and PT, respectively, by 1% were calculated.	0.8656679036751523
Standard calculations for AT III substitution indicated AT III recovery in all 37 patients who received AT III concentrate.	0.5270684153327692
However, there was a statistically significant difference between patients with CLF and ALF.	0.8521588841898766
In patients with CLF,  AT III was found to be 0.8 IU/kg ( +/- 0.1 SEM) and in those with ALF it was 1.5 IU/kg ( +/- 0.1 SEM) (P<0.05,  t-test).	0.8718394623310837
In patients treated with PPSB concentrate,  PPSB was 1.6 U/kg ( +/- 0.2 SEM) for both CLF and ALF groups.	0.8074860729739846
In patients with end stage liver disease standard rules for substitution with AT III-concentrate are adequate only for patients with CLF.	0.6139192436852844
In patients with ALF higher AT III doses are required to achieve the expected effect on endogenous AT III activity.	0.5761278468974469
Procoagulant activity, as reflected by PT, can be increased by 1% when 1.6 IU/kg PPSB concentrate is given.	0.7158999982590151
However, this study shows the effects of coagulation concentrates only 30 min after administration.	0.7827583008650191
An increased volume of distribution and increased turnover may explain the poor recovery of AT III activity in the ALF group, indicating that the dose of coagulation concentrate should be estimated against the background of the patient's clinical symptoms and diagnosis.	0.723723485116014
Fatigue is a common symptom in patients with multiple sclerosis.	0.7576657028148756
Rapid exhaustion and reduced exercise tolerance leads to difficulties in maintaining a normal daily life for many patients.	0.3240114659072785
Regular resting and short breaks can help to compensate this to a  certain degree.	0.4426753612121476
A sixteen year old girl with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis suffered two episodes of toxic shock syndrome within a short period of time.	0.5542796538188873
Both occasions were associated with menstruation.	0.24358077857980173
Mycoplasma hominis was isolated in the tracheal secretions once.	0.3772448185030072
Discussion: The etiology of the toxic shock syndrome has been extensively described.	0.6044136391454935
The toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 acts as a superantigen in toxic shock syndrome and interestingly a similar mechanism is discussed in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.	0.4905284792310617
This case report demonstrates the possibility of a close relationship between toxic shock syndrome and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and raises the suspicion of a similar immunopathogenetic process.	0.6327836704184596
Porokeratos of Mibelli is a rare inherited disorder of epidermal keratinization, whose pathogenesis is not fully understood.	0.5701147544983284
The common clinical feature is a erythematous plaque surrounded by a hyperkeratotic border.	0.4129697709821665
The histopathologic hallmark is a parakeratotic cornoid lamella.	0.2527081698603428
An unusual case of porokeratosis gigantea, a morphological variant of classical porokeratosis of Mibelli, is reported.	0.5450766927549178
The pathogenesis, taking in account especially the clonal hypothesis and premalignant nature of porokeratosis, is discussed.	0.5039602826271875
With the introduction of the non-benzodiazepine hypnotics zopiclone and zolpidem it was expected to have hypnotics without side effects and risks characteristically seen with benzodiazepines.	0.5254578965410349
We report two cases with high-dose usage and dependency of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics.	0.5684975831062613
Both patients were prescribed the drugs to treat sleep disturbances occuring during a depressive episode.	0.45788899812839445
While one patient had a polysubstance abuse there was no evidence for an abuse history in the other patient.	0.681002107028105
To reduce withdrawal symptoms long-acting benzodiazepines were given to both patients.	0.41707460155746834
Thus, it seems that not only patients with a history of substance abuse but also patients with a psychiatric disorder are at risk for abuse of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics.	0.7746349349101813
Considering the increasing number of case reports with abuse and dependence of zopiclone and zolpidem it seems necessary to reevaluate the dependency risk of the currently available non-benzodiazepine hypnotics.	0.4673085136068352
Fractures of the proximal radius in children may lead to deformities of the radial head and functional disturbance of pro- and supination.	0.7616730178054479
However, traumatization is not only caused by the injury itself, but may also occur secondary to surgical reduction, manipulation of fracture fragments and excessive physiotherapy.	0.6882048691663142
In a prospective long-term follow-study (2-20 years after trauma) of 38 children with displaced proximal radius fractures we found functional disturbances in 11 % of children only.	0.8515597418981008
These were not caused by radial head deformities, which were present on 83 % of follow-up radiographs.	0.8060597878610615
Functional impairment was mainly seen after open reduction or secondary growth disturbances.	0.43016057154911036
On follow-up radiographs all conservatively treated fracture angulations up to 60  ° had corrected themselves spontaneously.	0.5088986697134993
In view of the high complication rates after open reduction and the poor functional results, as well as the inconvenience for the pediatric patient and the economic aspects, we recommend a primary conservative treatment concept of proximal radius fractures in children.	0.7926041035071129
Patients who have undergone cardiac surgery with use of extracorporeal circulation frequently reveal marked hypovolaemia in spite of a highly positive fluid balance.	0.5649262720053982
This is thought to be due to transient microvascular damage and extravascular fluid shift.	0.37750145973347815
Further volume replacement to achieve haemodynamic stability in the postoperative period may cause fluid overload and congestive heart failure.	0.4889905158988162
The present study was designed to investigate whether this fluid overload could be avoided by using a hypertonic-hyperoncotic solution (group I: HHL, 10% hydroxyethylstarch 200/0.5 in 7.2% saline) instead of two different standard colloid solutions (group II: HA, 5% albumin; group III: HES, 6% hydroxyethylstarch in 0.9% saline).	0.7649571443658338
Purpose: The temporomandibular joint is a place of motion where release of proinflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1 (IL-1) induces cartilage destruction via production of nitric oxide (NO).	0.5150468622692776
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of continuous passive motion in the form of cyclic stretch on the synthesis of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).	0.471690489706968
Methods: Articular chondrocytes were harvested from rabbit cartilage slices and cultured in F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.	0.42042160120093214
Subsequently, cells (105/ml per well) were transferred to Flexercell plates, grown to 90% confluency, and subjected to one of the following regimens: (1) no mechanical strain (10 Hz, 20% elongation rate); (2) rhIL-1 (1 ng/ml); (3) mechanical strain; (4) mechanical strain and rhIL-1.	0.7279637583558777
The cells were exposed to cyclic stretch for 24 h. Thereafter, cells were trypsinized and centrifuged on microscope slides in a cytospin centrifuge.	0.4011220405805335
The presence of iNOS was determined by indirect immunoperoxidase staining using polyclonal rabbit anti-iNOS as primary antibodies, and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as secondary antibodies.	0.5034254485495746
Diaminobenzidine was used as substrate for HRP.	0.3613482877030649
Total NO production was spectrophotometrically measured in the supernatants of cultures using Greiss reaction.	0.2910012610198119
All experiments were done in triplicates and the statistical significance was analyzed by Student's t-test.	0.49101616395346315
Results: Cells with treatment 1 and 3 did not exhibit presence of iNOS.	0.5330654387223267
IL-1-treated cells in group 2 exhibited intense peroxidase staining.	0.7705877711995265
Cells in group 4 exposed to IL-1 and mechanical stress showed staining with considerably less intensity.	0.5306875326436867
Control cells treated with normal rabbit IgG as a primary antibody did not exhibit peroxidase staining.	0.5086530648412894
The data were further confirmed by measurement of statistically significant differences of NO levels in supernatants assessed in the four different treatment groups.	0.581846991109728
Conclusion: Our findings suggest that continuous passive motion exerts anti-inflammatory effects on chondrocytes, downregulating the quantity of iNOS -positive cells.	0.5183912998563754
Since NO acts as an intracellular, transcellular, and cytotoxic molecule, it has a basic importance for proper post-traumatic and postoperative TMJ function as well as the course and therapy of inflammatory TMJ diseases.	0.7332187340761329
Recently, we presented an implantable piezoelectrical hearing aid transducer.	0.5463956856276423
Its characteristics make it suitable for implantation in patients with sensorineural hearing loss.	0.4040497759569174
The transducer transmits micromechanical vibrations instead of sound into the hearing organ.	0.32297709963934457
Efficiency of the transducer implant was investigated in ten cat ears.	0.6218347562068737
After determining preoperative (acoustical) BERA threshold, the middle ear was opened and the piezoelectrical transducer coupled to various ossicles or the perilymph.	0.5128755035410597
BERA responses were recorded following stimulation of umbo, long incus process, stapes head, stapes foot plate, and vestibulum.	0.5613988166596473
By comparing the acoustical and mechanical threshold, a correlation was found between the stimulus level of acoustical and mechanical stimulation.	0.612412892995083
An electrical transducer voltage of 1 Vrms* was equivalent to sound-pressure levels between 100 and 128 dB SPL at the tympanic membrane.	0.41008483356760733
To judge hearing impression, stimulus-dependent latencies of the early acoustically and mechanically evoked potentials (waves P1 to P5) and their thresholds were analyzed.	0.5255115507094021
After coupling the piezoelectrical transducer to the long incus process, latencies corresponded well to stimulation.	0.41386045633911794
They were almost completely similar when the equivalent sound-pressure level of 100 dB SPL was achieved by the transducer voltage level.	0.5091546644659123
Pyoderma gangrenosum was first described in 1930 by Brunsting, Goeckermann and O'Leary.	0.33012390170351624
Nevertheless we found some illustrations in an atlas on dermatology, published by Marie-Nicolas Devergie in the first half of the 19th century, which appear to be pyoderma gangrenosum.	0.5307986310475645
In addition to discussions of typical syphilitic affections of the skin, Devergie's "Clinique de la Maladie Syphilitique" includes illustrations of gangrenous ulcers, which appeared unexpectedly after local and systemic therapy with mercury.	0.5197373836238034
Devergie interpreted those enlarging ulcers as a side effect of mercury therapy.	0.33802722110296746
Thus we were able to find evidence of pyoderma gangrenosum more than 100 years before first description in 1930.	0.4092114694979891
The etiology of this clinical picture is still unsettled.	0.708129713143463
The favorite postulate has been a bacterial genesis which was the subject of numerous publications until the 1960s.	0.5169769474097666
Multiple-system atrophy (MSA) is characterized by progressive autonomic failure with cerebellar, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs.	0.459978385359451
In MSA patients laryngoscopy often reveals unilateral or bilateral abductor vocal fold palsies.	0.3053555250243923
However, assessment of sites of obstruction and their severity is needed.	0.4394888551362929
We report our clinical experience in managing a 56-year-old, obese male MSA patient (1.76 m height, 100 kg weight, BMI 32.3 kg/m2) who was admitted for evaluation of snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness.	0.7131764772750839
Endoscopy while awake demonstrated an incomplete abductor vocal fold palsy.	0.28147833398384886
Polysomnography confirmed heavy snoring with arousals (11.1/h) and an RDI of 1.4/h.	0.857785335704599
Sleep efficiency was low (51.9%) due to long intermittent awake periods.	0.4808681691978188
Sleep videoendoscopy of the upper airway proved the entire pharynx to be open during REM and non-REM sleep.	0.5181116377061872
During inspiration fluttering movements of the vocal cords caused the snoring.	0.39920443704631325
This was regularly terminated by arousals.	0.24395741022894765
The further treatment is discussed.	0.4047611258668713
In general, glottic snoring without daytime stridor is rare and has only been described in MSA patients.	0.5413179720533562
However, certain of these patients will also be pharyngeal snorers.	0.7185552328747774
The source of the sound and site of obstruction can only be diagnosed by sleep videoendoscopy.	0.6155046694564278
Introduction: Homografts for valve replacement are indicated in acute valve endocarditis.	0.44055179153649693
It is assumed that they possess anti-infective properties.	0.3708634669123576
Homografts are an established indication in aortic valve replacement.	0.4219032328886757
We present our early results with homografts for mitral valve replacement in acute endocarditis.	0.5525546130762801
The surgical management of enlarged inferior turbinates has been actively debated for more than a century.	0.44267393906609387
The second part of this review decribes the following techniques: laterofracture, submucous turbinectomy, concho-antropexy, partial turbinectomy, anterior turbinectomy, inferior turbinoplasty, total turbinectomy, and vidian neurectomy.	0.607917215367414
Indications, advantages, disadvantages, complications, and controversies of each treatment modalitiy are reviewed and discussed.	0.5500913151077275
Partial or submucosal resection should be prefered, because there are moderate side effects and the amount of turbinate excised can be altered according the degree of symptomatology.	0.5357781345784234
Total turbinectomy or vidian neurectomy are indicated if all other treatment attemps do not succeed.	0.3328644002550376
Acute oxalosis is an important disorder causing serious abnormalities.	0.4949189616469153
Acute oxalosis may come about by ethylene glycol poisoning; in recent years iatrogenic cases of acute oxalosis have also been described following iv treatments of naftidrofuryl, a vasodilator.	0.6100849818472855
Furthermore, chronic asymptomatic intestinal oxalosis may turn symptomatic by a superimposed major load of oxalate.	0.43865116633774276
Acute oxalosis results in acute renal failure; in addition oxalate-induced angiopathy may be associated with necrosis of affected tissue.	0.5873301269457415
The diagnosis of acute oxalosis requires a demonstration of oxalate crystals in the urine and in other affected tissues.	0.6210246352826515
In terms of therapy, hemodialysis should be used promptly in cases of ethylene glycol poisoning and a worsening of the renal function.	0.5520132231057463
In cases of a secondary chronic intestinal oxalosis prophylactic measures such as maintaining an elevated urinary flow rate and prescribing oral calcium supplements will be helpful.	0.48588326101572316
Generalized granuloma annulare is a rare variant of granuloma annulare affecting the trunk and extremities with a multitude of lesions.	0.5592003781383258
In contrast to localized granuloma annulare, generalized granuloma annulare occurs in older patients, shows a stronger association with diabetes, and is characteristically chronic.	0.6967679556173053
Like our 55-year-old patient, most patients present with papules and annular plaques; less often, macular or non-annular lesions may be encountered.	0.5575679552401622
Histology often fails to show necrobiotic or necrotic connective tissue changes demarcated by a palisading granuloma.	0.30683968493657676
Instead, there are diffuse dermal, band-like or nodular aggregations of histiocytes intermingled with some multinucleated giant cells and a predominantly lymphocytic infiltrate in the periphery.	0.45951765555174184
Because of its special characteristics, it has been suggested that generalized granuloma annulare might constitute a separate disease entity and that it should be classed among the primary cutaneous histiocytoses as a diffuse dermal histiocytosis.	0.6651739248513792
Using immunohistochemistry to determine the macrophage phenotype of the lesional histiocytes, we have shown that generalized granuloma annulare is not a cutaneous histiocytosis.	0.744964967185208
Neither MS-1 high-molecular-weight protein, a new specific marker for cutaneous non-Langerhans cell histiocytoses, nor CD1a, the well-known marker for Langerhans cells and Langerhans cell histiocytoses, is expressed by the lesional histiocytes of our patient.	0.6195589965726063
In contrast, the antigen expression pattern was diagnostic for non-infectious granulomas and was highly similar to that in localized granuloma annulare.	0.5569873848031066
In contrast to the successful treatment of localized granuloma annulare reported with intralesional interferon -1, systemic treatment with interferon -2b (9x106 units three times a week) was ineffective.	0.7526176237753237
The aims of the study were: (1) to predict reversal time from intensive atracurium blockade; and (2) to determine the optimal time of neostigmine administration during recovery from atracurium blockade, i.e., the time at which the administration of neostigmine results in the shortest total recovery time (time from administration of last supplemental dose of atracurium to train-of-four [TOF] ratio 0.70), and at the same time results in the shortest time from administration of neostigmine to TOF ratio 0.70.	0.7504345105353243
The spontaneous and neostigmine-facilitated recovery in 52 healthy women anaesthetised with thiopentone, fentanyl, droperidol, and nitrous oxide was followed.	0.43919026417513773
Post-tetanic count (PTC) of TOF stimulation of the ulnar nerve and mechanomyography were used for monitoring neuromuscular transmission.	0.6261261103285345
The neuromuscular blockade was induced with atracurium 0.6 mg/kg and supplemental doses of 0.15 mg/kg were given when the first twitch response in the TOF (TH1) had recovered to 20%.	0.6576047593701924
Neostigmine 0.036 mg/kg body weight was given at different levels of neuromuscular blockade to 37 of the patients.	0.5784184806216555
Multiple regression analyses including pre-reversal time (time from administration of the last atracurium dose to neostigmine administration), PTC, weight, and age of the patients suggest that pre-reversal time is the best predictor of reversal time: reversal time=27.3 min-(0.89xpre-reversal time [min]; (SEE=6.0 min).	0.681816431620128
If pre-reversal time is unknown, PTC can be used: reversal time=24 min-(4.5xln PTC) at time of reversal); (SEE=6.8 min).	0.7366832385569702
Total recovery time was 47 min (SEM=2.0 min, n=15) in the patients allowed to recover spontaneously, and 29 min (SEM=1.2 min, n=29) in the patients reversed by neostigmine; the difference of 18 min (SE diff 2.0 min) was significant (P<0.0005).	0.7949083170694098
The level of blockade indicated by PTC (1 - 24) at the time of reversal had no influence on the total recovery time.	0.7744454203725364
The spontaneous recovery times from reappearance of TH1 and TH1=10% to TOF ratio 0.70 were 29.2 min (SEM=1.7 min) and 24.4 min (SEM=2.6 min), respectively.	0.62914947898365
The results suggest that pre-reversal time is the strongest predictor of reversal time when neostigmine is administered during intense atracurium blockade.	0.4367262451950174
To achieve the optimal time-saving effect, neostigmine must be given 18 min (the time saved by giving neostigmine) plus 7 to 11 min (needed for neostigmine to reach its peak effect), giving a total of 25 to 29 min before TOF ratio 0.70.	0.5912883747925406
As TH1 is between 1% and 10% 25 to 29 min before TOF ratio 0.70 is reached during spontaneous recovery, the optimal level of neuromuscular blockade for neostigmine administration in atracurium blockade is when TH1 is between 1% and 10%.	0.600383369313281
Reversal time can be predicted as 27.3 min-(0.89xpre-reversal time (min), and the optimal time of neostigmine administration in atracurium blockade appears to be when TH1 is 1% - 10%.	0.795914608544986
A seminar for hospital physicians in management positions (Württembergische Verwaltungs- und Wirtschaftsakademie, Stuttgart) in October 1994 illustrated the immediate relevance of W. R. Bion's book Experiences in Groups and Other Papers, published in 1961.	0.48771076758506515
The aim of this article, recalling Bion's experiences in groups by presenting in seminar's leadership principles, is to show how these experiences can be applied to an understanding of the individual.	0.702499984162642
If continuous seizure activity lasts longer than 5 minutes generalized tonic-clonic seizures require prompt treatment, if significant morbidity and mortality are to be avoided.	0.5599716044033162
The mortality varies (mean: 20%) depending on patient age and etiology.	0.6640756609633865
Control of status epilepticus is achieved by benzodiazepines in about 80% of cases: Lorazepam is recommended due to its longer-acting effects on the central nervous system.	0.6629787698216919
To maintain the anticonvulsive effect phenytoin is usually administered intravenously.	0.32763909407126945
Fosphenytoin (not approved in Germany) has advantages over phenytoin, because it can be given three times more rapidly and produces fewer side effects.	0.6607286968268898
The IV use of valproic acid in status epilepticus seems to be promising, but needs further evaluation.	0.5032864594248745
There is no generally accepted treatment protocol for the therapy of persistent seizure activity lasting more than 60 minutes (i. e., refractory status epilepticus).	0.597737744468129

Since the life span of our society is increasing and the expectation of high functional demands is growing more and more older people take part in sports activities emphasises the necessity of early diagnosis of rotator cuff lesions and their correct treatment.	0.5165599632921078
The goal of any diagnostic means should be a proper treatment of rotator cuff lesions according to the detected pathology.	0.5732962007864677
New arthroscopic techniques to surgically reconstruct rotator cuff tears have brought the operative repair techniques another step further.	0.3620026092729029
In cases of large and complex cuff tears the surgeon can individually select an adequate reconstruction procedure which includes anatomical-, partial-, tendon-transfer and muscle-transfer repairs.	0.5006207915762202
In cases of irreparable tears with cuff-tear arthropathy and consecutive superior migration of the humeral head hemiarthroplasty or the inverse deltoid prosthesis have to be considered.	0.4226990169823719
Based on clinical, radiological and arthroscopic findings we developed algorithms that will lead to the best suited procedure for a given lesion.	0.6504385671249375
Almost all patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) experience symptoms of nocturnal hypoventilation during the course of the illness.	0.5554989515534634
These symptoms can develop  years before death and may severely affect quality of life.	0.45155545350335147
Non-invasive intermittent home mechanical ventilation (HMV) via mask is a possible palliative measure for  these symptoms, which is not often used in  Germany.	0.6799406608689542
We report on our experience with HMV in 24 patients with ALS.	0.8278389150241223

Many clinical studies have been performed investigating corneal endothelial cell loss after penetrating keratoplasty using different preservation methods.	0.593691980384091
Most studies, however, included variable follow-up intervals, neglecting the dynamic cell loss over the course of time.	0.43597165275494576
The aim of this study was to perform endothelial cell evaluation 5 years after penetrating keratoplasty using two different storage methods.	0.5161339529979276
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is generally associated with ulcerative colitis (UC).	0.5266931308471724
The disease typically progresses slowly, but ultimately, and leads to cirrhosis, liver failure or bile duct cancer.	0.6695515530327968
PSC patients with simultanous ulcerative colitis are also at higher risk for colorectal cancer.	0.37272026285112697
At the present time, there is no effective treatment for PSC, although preliminary data show encouraging results after treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid.	0.6632071336435712
However, there are no data concerning the delay or prevention of progress of the disease with this drug, because follow-up time is not yet long enough.	0.9503019245364106
Isolated bile duct strictures should be treated endoscopically.	0.478129768633772
The possible effect of proctocolectomy on the course of PSC is controversial.	0.3343827984276706
Liver transplantation is the therapy of choice for PSC in its final stage.	0.5975029718948439
The 5-year survival rate (89 %) is significantly better than after transplantation for other indications.	0.7692987641578446
Patients with ulcerative colitis have to be followed up by lifelong colonoscopy.	0.553255167416033
Although the course of UC after transplantation is mostly asymptomatic, these patients are at higher risk for colorectal cancer.	0.7195948799008909
On 3 June 1998 a high-speed train (Inter City Express, ICE) collided with a bridge at a speed of 200 km/h.	0.4176543731715158

Severe complications after chiropractic treatments rarely occur.	0.24513811564473606
They happen mostly when manipulating the atlantoaxial and the craniovertebral articulations or when not attending to the contraindications like partial dislocation and hemivertebra.	0.2862982535496913
Therefore, x-ray pictures from the part of the vertebral region to be treated are inevitable and likewise the medical scientific associations demand them uniformly to minimize the risks.	0.6002994699636434
Nevertheless, our case-report shows also inconspicuous radiological findings do not exclude local tumor infestation of the bones with possible deleterious results for the patient treated by the chiropractor.	0.5799474971730356
In patients with painful, possibly hemorrhagic vesicles or black crusts, especially on hands/fingers or face/neck with typical history (contact to cows or feral/cats) the possibility of a cowpox/catpox infection has to be considered.	0.5632821851902122
The clinical diagnosis can be confirmed with the electron microscopy; cytoplasmic inclusions may be detected histologically.	0.609419343501714
Further useful diagnostic tools are the identification of the cowpox/catpox virus by PCR or in cell culture as well as serological tests to detect virus specific antibodies.	0.48658957521467117
We report the development of typical skin lesions of a cowpox/catpox infection in two female patients who had contact with cows or cats.	0.6851002852142484

The laboratory findings of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets are signs of an acute pregnancy complication often associated with abdominal pain and intrauterine growth retardation.	0.609832050997387
A high coincidence with symptoms of preeclampsia is observed.	0.3920647986017987
The high rate of complications and the restitution of laboratory findings to normal values following cessation of pregnancy have led to the general recommendation of immediate delivery for about a decade.	0.6060436455719149
However, the fact that HELLP syndrome can also occur for up to 1 week post-partum and the results of studies on prolongation of pregnancy call this former concept of management into question, in particular, since there is a high rate of hemostasiological complications after cesarean section in acute HELLP syndrome.	0.665143952423503
Because of the correlation of complications of HELLP syndrome with those of severe preeclampsia, the indication for delivery should be based on the signs of preeclampsia and additional clinical features.	0.6900810579225845
The results of studies on prolongation of pregnancies in HELLP syndrome and severe preeclampsia support this concept.	0.4771738805534667
Innervation of the head and neck differs from other regions of the body in certain respects.	0.647200450531164
In particular, besides the external cuneate nucleus, thick-calibre neck muscle afferents project directly, to the vestibular nuclear complex.	0.5080483316598933
This projection is most prominent in segments C2 and 3 and is sparse or absent in more caudal segments.	0.42028661918630855
Thus, proprioceptive neck muscle afferents gain direct access to vestibulospinal, vestibulooculomotor and other secondary or even higher order vestibular neurons that receive labyrinthine input.	0.35542975650759656
Proprioceptive input via indirect spinovestibular pathways is also most prominent from C2 and 3 compared to more caudal levels.	0.3442866018070646
Likewise, thin calibre, mainly nociceptive afferents from cervical segments are channelled via the parabrachial nuclei in the rostral pons to limbic structures different from the targets of thoracolumbar afferents.	0.42089241937814303
It is tempting to consider these neuroantomical peculiarities relevant for the pathogenesis of the puzzling symptoms after whiplash injury.	0.4454255022017577
In some recent German textbooks of pain management there is maintained that psychological dependence to opioids in pain patients is not a real problem.	0.5122940610036127

Real bone tumors are rarely encountered in the daily routine of radiological practice.	0.49874645586224886
Therefore, for a general radiologist there is no need for a specialist knowledge on this field.	0.8315524820483934
However, he should be able to distinguish benign from malignant lesions in order to avoid unnecessary biopsies.	0.6237528457641164
A systematic approach towards osteolytic lesions, e. g. according to the classification of Lodwick, is mandatory.	0.5945479111452125
CT and MRI are indicated to clear up the anatomy in areas of superposition artefacts in conventional radiology and to determine the inner structure of a lesion, e. g. fatty tissue, liquid/solid.	0.5371981504783343

During routine middle ear surgery prototypes of implantable piezoelectric hearing aid transducers were coupled to the ossicular chain of 28 patients.	0.4689887591644972
Pure tone thresholds in a broad frequency range (250 Hz-8 kHz) and perception of music were the basis of psychoacoustic evaluation of the transfer properties of the prototypes in this human study.	0.6755169067785018
The piezoelectric transducer reached an equivalent transducer sound-pressure level of up to 145 dB SPL and frequencies of 10 kHz.	0.4247869199634192
The dynamics for music reached 32 dB, which was identical with the results of the preoperative investigations using hi-fi headsets (33 dB).	0.7176509394205209
The low nonlinear distortions of around 0.1% and the frequency range up to 10 kHz are reflected in the positive evaluation of sound quality by 84% of the patients involved.	0.824420647193676
The study is the basis for realizing a piezoelectric transducer designed for routine clinical implantations.	0.6394972388782735
The transducer is thought to be part of a totally implantable future hearing aid for rehabilitation of moderate and severe sensory neural hearing loss predominantly in the middle and high frequency range.	0.6575118758958083

Several investigations prove that monaural acoustic deprivation induces detrimental changes in the auditory pathway.	0.45915734476887676
So far the major interest focused on degenerative processes on the deprived side, while effects on the contralateral untreated side were not taken into consideration.	0.5721169468913795
This ontogenetic study investigates effects of early monaural acoustic deprivation on the functional development of the acoustically evoked auditory brainstem response (ABR) in the Mongolian gerbil.	0.5678521076938419
Young gerbils were deafened by a single intracochlear application of neomycin sulfate.	0.30992918944864545
The ABR development on the contralateral side differed in a late developmental period from that of normally hearing animals.	0.4775247747730287
These changes persisted until adulthood.	0.19747865166268677
Between day 55 and day 90 a significant 5 dB decrease of the ABR thresholds and a significant shortening of the interpeak latency II-V occured.	0.5141584473682765
The results confirm that a complete monaural deprivation during the sensible or critical period leads on the contralateral side to plastic or compensatory changes in the auditory brainstem.	0.5354143001467933
There are estimated to be 20 million people blinded by cataracts, 80-90 % of whom live in rural areas of developing countries where expert surgical resources are scarce.	0.501350424505463

Dorsal fusion with the internal fixator has become the standard treatment of instabilities and deformities of the thoracolumbar spine.	0.5939506366159907
With our new device, the modular spine fixator (MSF), which has been specially designed for short-distance instrumentations, we have increasingly been treating unstable injuries of the thoracolumbar spine by one-level stabilization.	0.7204480347042032
Prerequisite is an accurate evaluation of the indication, including CT and MRI to assess the involvement of the intervertebral disc and the ligamental structures.	0.7499192796190735
The operative technique differs in some details from the procedure in moremulti-level instrumentations, especially concerning the application of the pedicle screws.	0.665863024310799
The instrumentation is always combined with posterior allogenic bone grafting.	0.2775404392356082
Since the beginning of 1993 we also perform anterior autogenic transpedicular bone grafting.	0.34273700192708
Between Januar 1991 and July 1995, 57 one-level stabilizations with the MSF were performed.	0.4232347254377431
Of the 57 patients operated on 39, 27 men and 12 women, with an average age of 41 years, have had a clinical and radiographic follow-up examination so far, on average, 27 months after the accident.	0.8646704812203726
Seventeen patients were completely free of pain and 17 patients (were only) sensivite to weather changes or had minor pain during great physical stress.	0.4807975150131962
Five patients had pain even during slight physical stress or at rest.	0.3956710905337725
The preoperatively measured Cobb angle was 15.1  ° on average, after the operation 5.2  °, and at the time of the follow-up examination amounted to 8.1  °.	1.0076592872763561
The patients' range of motion was normal.	0.8258882211405643
Only five minor complications have been seen.	0.4095414094194716
No implant fatigue failure has been noted in this series.	0.3851222316969999
We derive from these results that, for correct indications, one-level stabilization can be performed successfully and should be firmly established in the operative treatment of unstable fractures of the thoracolumbar spine.	0.8043311848029537
Between May 1995 and March 1996 we were able to diagnose and remove glomus tumors of the left nasal cavity from three female patients.	0.5596537606410488

Hemangiopericytoma, non-chromaffin paraganglioma,  hidradenoma, cavernous hemangioma and nevus cell nevi have to be excluded by histology and immunohistochemical techniques.	0.557035492393646
From a clinical perspective the bleeding  septal polyp (granuloma telangiectaticum sive pyogenicum sive pediculatum) has to be considered because it often comes from Kieselbachi's plexus, has a mushroom-like appearance and bleeds slightly.	0.5855614269232436
Background: Gynaecological surgery including laparoscopy is frequently associated with PONV.	0.33990326282428784
Therefore, choosing an anaesthetic with only little side effects in operations eligible for outpatient surgery is at least as important as applying anaesthetics that enable fast-tracking.	0.5424298435111498
The reliability of continuous fibreoptic oximetry in cerebral venous blood and its correlation with intracranial and cerebral perfusion pressures (pressure-volume curve) were examined in an experimental porcine study.	0.6379705748893525
In a population-based study of 110 women between 53 and 82 years of age (mean age 64.5 +/- 7.9 years) static posturography data were compared to functional items of gait and balance in common geriatric mobility scales.	0.6092463700806744
Posturographic data of double-stance with eyes open and eyes closed (DSEO; DSEC) did not differ from those of a group of healthy women previously tested for intact nervous system function.	0.5161400022201632
The total neuromuscular score - roughly corresponding to the well-known Tinetti score - did not correlate to the posturographic measures.	0.6396881362962994
DSEC correlated with the items "rapid walking" and "single-stance left leg".	0.4817344799349437
Age, vision, and neuropsychologic test results correlated with DSEO, "rapid walking", "single-stance right leg", "single-stance left leg", and "walking a figure eight".	0.68027939176729
Multiple linear regression confirmed the impact of age, vision, DSEO, and DSEC on "rapid walking" with a 34% variance explanation.	0.5733645119479646
Posturographic parameters did predict other selected gait and balance items.	0.2948310058527487

The ocular surface epithelia with the tear film as a unit provide clear vision and comfort and serve as the first line of defense.	0.4906317642633652
It is important to understand how ocular surface health is maintained and how ocular surface failure occurs.	0.4549829369610419
Furthermore, it is timely to summarize new information concerning action mechanisms and clinical uses of amniotic membrane transplantation for ocular surface reconstruction.	0.4902107645497478
When appropriately processed and preserved, amniotic membrane as a native matrix can be used as a graft to restore conjunctival surfaces following removal of lesions such as pterygium, tumor, scar, symblepharon, and conjunctivochalasis.	0.5229700080978318
It can also be used as a graft to restore corneal surfaces suffering from limbal stem-cell deficiency.	0.558503620772357
For partial limbal deficiency, amniotic membrane alone is frequently sufficient, while for total limbal deficiency it needs to be combined with limbal stem-cell transplantation with or without corneal transplantation.	0.5215630762552605
When used as a graft or patch, amniotic membrane can facilitate healing of persistent corneal ulcers and recurrent corneal erosion and reduce corneal haze following keratectomy.	0.44254990622160567
Reported data indicate that amniotic membrane transplantation facilitates rapid healing with recovery of a normal epithelial phenotype in the epithelium and reduces inflammation, vascularization, and scarring in the stroma.	0.5225804572843511

This therapy influences pubertal development and growth of healthy adolescents.	0.34780635232444496
For that reason patients should be carefully selected, taking into account the benefits and possible side effects.	0.5592711666721828
Colour measurements were performed on powdery substances of whitish to slightly yellow colouring (cocaine samples of different composition) in order to give an unequivocal optical description of the samples and relate them to control samples.	0.5467973034540983
The measurements were carried out with a spectrophotometer (Carl-Zeiss-Jena GmbH, MCS 400) using a halogen bulb as light source (standard illuminant D65).	0.5041523791614818
Colorimetric classification was made on the basis of the CIE-L*a*b*-values.	0.3361264949719421
The examination showed that specimens of similar or different chemical composition which could not be distinguished macroscopically revealed characteristic differences in the CIE-L*a*b*-measures.	0.40003760294923024
The method gives a first clue for orientation within a few minutes when comparing substances in specimens of different origin.	0.5456244152349694
Eighty-five patients with grade 2 or grade 3 sprains of the acromioclavicular (AC) joint were evaluated clinically and radiographically 32 months after injury.	0.6141340759666806

Nine of 10 patients (90%) with grade 3 sprains (group IIb) had more pronounced displacement and increased mobility of the lateral end of the clavicle after conservating treatment.	0.8442143900045102
After surgery, dislocation and increased horizontal, mobility of the lateral end of the clavicle occurred in 18 (44%) of 41 patients with grade 3 sprains (group II a P<0.0001).	0.7938345019697066
However, these findings did not correlate with the functional outcome.	0.6854799040872255
At follow-up there was a significant increase in degenerative changes seen on radio-graphs (P<0.035) in all patients.	0.7244523973152989
Again these findings did not correlate with the functional outcome.	0.4085552632796992
More degenerative radiological changes were observed in patients who had undergone surgery (P<0.003).	0.7133666844193429
Patients with grade 2 sprains were more frequently restricted in sporting activity after surgery (P<0.05).	0.4542076955799617
Patients with grade 3 sprains who were treated surgically complained of pain more frequently (P<0.01), and they returned to work later than patients who were treated conservatively after grade 3 sprains.	0.7556392960942931
An additional rehabilitation program guided by a physiotherapist seemed to have no impact on the functional outcome.	0.5644116978343967

Macular amyloidosis (MA) and lichen amyloidosus (LA) are the two major variants of the primary cutaneous amyloidoses which present with severe and therapy resistent itching.	0.7271816999868891
Various therapeutic modalities such as antihistamines, intralesional injection or topical application of corticosteroids, etretinate, UVB irradiation and dermoabrasion have been employed with variable success.	0.41879506750816436
Recently, in a few case reports authors have observed encouraging beneficial clinical effects by using topical dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO).	0.6170732595144279
In our study 10 patients with either MA or LA or biphasic amyloidosis were treated with a 50% solution of DMSO in water.	0.7038192790981499
9 of them showed marked clinical improvement at the end of 6-20 weeks of treatment.	0.5370698072354485
Degranulation and depletion of the mast cells by DMSO is the most probable explanation for the rapid improvement of itching beginning within the first week of therapy.	0.680662931399645
Remarkable flattening of the lichenoid papules which was obtained within 11 weeks of treatment is interpreted as a result of the improvement of itching and the related scratch effect.	0.6850093934617212
Histological examination after treatment revealed no disappearance of amyloid deposits in the papillary dermis.	0.5191157325785689
In the follow-up period relapses of itching and papules were observed.	0.5686847185762123
Therefore further studies are needed to find out the optimal procedure of therapy.	0.5018663942326848
As early as 1974, Brian advocated the prone position for ventilated patients [5].	0.4202849152857686
He suggested that this position might enhance ventilation of the dorsal parts of the lungs, thereby improving oxygenation.	0.628636599789868
These considerations have been confirmed by several experimental and clinical studies [1, 6, 13, 17].	0.6985590919175743
Better secretion removal, decreased intrapulmonary shunting, and an increased FRC are thought to be responsible for the observed improvement of oxygenation.	0.717661248772081
However, the prone position never became very popular in the clinical treatment of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).	0.6083757555364309
Routine performance of thoracic CT scans in ARDS patients demonstrated preferential distribution of pathological densities in the dependent lung areas.	0.39585081290670265
The prone position therefore could possibly benefit these patients, as shown by two recent studies [8, 11].	0.6201026362826483
The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of repeatedly turning the patient to the prone position on gas exchange and thoracic CT findings in multiple-trauma patients.	0.601527824867712
Seven ventilated intensive care patients with severe ARDS (Murray Score >2.5 [9], Quotient >0.7 [4], mean airway pressure >18 cm H2O, thoracic CT scan showing dorsal atelectases) were included in the study.	0.8633642777927638
Patients were turned from the supine to the prone position at 12-h intervals using an air-cushion bed (Mediscus, Austria).	0.40016785149057943
Redistribution of dystelectatic or atelectatic dependent lung areas was verified by means of repeated thoracic CT scans (Figs.	0.39154757439780413
The patients were intermittently turned for 6.5  +/-  1.1 days.	0.9448009150446568
The course of gas exchange is shown in Figs.	0.513684540615435
Initially, improvement of the respiratory quotient could only be achieved during prone positioning, from the 2nd day in the supine position as well.	0.7466945154705182
Intrapulmonary shunting showed a similar trend (Figs.	0.29378763112604256
No significant changes in cardiovascular parameters could be observed.	0.4729415224504603
Control thoracic CT scans showed uniform reduction of atelectases in dependent lung areas (Figs.	0.43550598130799384
The inspiratory fraction of oxygen could be reduced significantly as of the 2nd day (Fig.	0.5749829570828939
Constant levels of positive end-expiratory pressure and tidal volume were associated with decreasing mean and plateau airway pressures (Fig.	0.431920320368171
Repeatedly turning the patient to the prone position produced long-lasting improvement of arterial oxygenation, which persists up to the end of the weaning process.	0.6709694975643545
This is in good accordance with other studies [1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 13, 17], however, this is the first study to report an observation period of more than 6 days of repeatedly turning the patient.	0.7533073194253566
These positive effects on gas exchange can be attributed to sudden improvement of the ventilation-perfusion ratio within the lung areas that become dependent after turning to the prone position.	0.4609641342822402
Due to reduced hydrostatic pressure [11] and relative hyperventilation [7, 16], previously collapsed alveoli are recruited in the lung areas that become non-dependent after turning to the prone position.	0.48571219871450455
After a gynecological operation under therapy with unfractionated and low molecular weight heparin, a 63 year old patient developed right-sided ascending pelvic thrombosis with multiple pulmonary embolism and infarction pneumonia, septic-toxic circulatory failure, and thrombocytopenia.	0.6310485033899438
Heparin-associated thrombocytopenia (HAT) type II was diagnosed.	0.45557574695244335
Because of contraindications against thrombolysis a cava-filter was implanted, heparin therapy was stopped, and anticoagulation with recombinant hirudin was started.	0.5071935691903589
Inspite of this, an arterial thrombosis of the A. femoralis superficialis developed and had to be treated surgically.	0.7004770725716499
From this time on, no further thromboembolic complications were noticed.	0.5533608303335691
Overlapping coumarin therapy was begun.	0.19814683545213488
Due to ubiquitous coumarin-necrosis, rapid progressive toxic circulatory failure with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) developed two days after terminating hirudin therapy necessitating high dose catecholamine therapy.	0.4249656539032525
A second course of hirudin resulted in complete restitution of the coumarin-necrosis without the need for re-operation.	0.41729197902512727
Subsequent coumarin-therapy, which was gradually increased over two weeks, was without further complications.	0.7088895338533546
Thus, hirudin appears to be a new and safe alternative to a therapy with the heparinoid danaparoid in HAT type II with fulminant thromboembolic complications and especially in coumarin-necrosis with critical septic-toxic circulatory failure and DIC.	0.6227239211133248
A prospective process-analysis evaluating organizational, medical and medical-technical alterations and real-time-documentation during out-of-hospital resuscitations (n=71) was performed due to the definitions of the "Utstein-Style".	0.6123630282153142
The gaseous radical nitric oxide (NO) is catalyzed by conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline by one cytokine inducible form (iNOS), which becomes active only within hours after the inducing event, and by two constitutively expressed forms, endothelial (eNOS) and neuronal (nNOS), which are regulated by the cytosolic concentration of free Ca2+.	0.6080811832921783
Brain nNOS is physiologically present in discrete populations of neurons, which are all excited by glutamate via the ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, which controls a Ca2+ channel.	0.5077170198077017
After its diffusion into the extraneuronal space, NO may activate in neurons, which as a rule do not stain for NOS, soluble guanylyl cyclase and formation of cGMP as an intracellular messenger.	0.5216455030228813
Beyond that, NO is important as a feedback regulator of glutamatergic excitation.	0.5043007956674634
NO as a nitrosylating agent enhances disulfide bonding of vicinal sulfhydryl (thiol) groups of the redox modulatory site of the NMDA receptor complex and thereby down-regulates its Ca2+ channel activity.	0.3526916872454176
Histochemically studies have revealed the presence of large number of NOS containing neurons in the magnocellular and parvocellular subdivisions of hypothalamic nuclei.	0.361279059693962
Numerous studies conform to the view that NO participates in the control of many different neurosecretory processes, especially of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurosecretory system.	0.566142734685682
The redox-modulatory site of the NMDA receptor appears, therefore, as a critical structure in the control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis.	0.5336182120901477
Moreover, glucocorticoids augment neuronal excitotoxicity by increasing the expression of glutamate receptors and inhibition of glutamate reuptake.	0.38351604089710567
In attempting to explain the many conflicting results obtained in studies with NO, it may be worthwhile to consider that the actual redox-environment of distinct loci of the brain may determine the final function of NO, acting either as a transmitter or neuromodulator or, in the worst case, causing neurodestruction.	0.6390217029889627
It seems likely that any kind of stress by altering the ratio of reduced vs oxidized thiols within the central nervous system influences neuronal excitability, with NO working either as an amplifier or as a feedback regulator of neuronal excitation or inhibition, which may alter acutely or chronically, among others, the homeostasis of a given neurosecretory system.	0.5914158975357255
Purpose: To study early and late findings of macular retinal thickness in patients with hypotony following filtering procedures.	0.6010609966771728
Even in the era of coronary stenting, acute coronary artery occlusion continues to represent a significant limitation of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA).	0.5711095165294399
Despite application of heparin and aspirin, abrupt vessel closure still occurs in 2-8%, depending on the definition applied.	0.4965939866301016
Especially patients receiving PTCA for acute coronary syndromes are at high risk for abrupt vessel closure.	0.5271252302994022
The formation of an intracoronary thrombus plays a central role in the pathogenesis of abrupt vessel closure.	0.4866763090698687
Dipyridamole induces dilatation of coronary arteries and prevents platelet aggregation by a mechanism that differs from that of aspirin.	0.46924566980671223
The primary purpose of the study was to evaluate whether adjunctive local intracoronary therapy with dipyridamole could reduce the incidence of coronary artery occlusion following PTCA.	0.7028816426246626
Secondary endpoints were defined as myocardial infarction, necessity for bypass grafting, and death.	0.548282512385878
The intravesical instillation of BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) in cases of relapsed superficial bladder cancer is an acknowledged kind of prophylaxis.	0.4472625982164284
It is uncertainly up to now whether a verification of the immune systems competence is necessary.	0.5521418715291986
The recommendations in this problem are very different.	0.38286342794806416
In conclusion to the recent literature we think that a verification of the immune system before BCG installation in the urinary bladder has not a prognostic value.	0.5327716371648707
Additionally, the legal obligingness of this immunotest is doubtful.	0.46468922591119816
Discoid meniscus is one of the commonest anatomical variations of the meniscus.	0.4294221456980549
There is at the moment no consensus on the aetiology of discoid meniscus.	0.590702833123269
According to Watanabe three types can be differentiated: the complete form, the incomplete form and the hypermobile Wrisberg form.	0.6059528820487831
Discoid meniscus frequently remains asymptomatic and thus requires no treatment.	0.276153054455971
Partial meniscectomy is recommended for treatment of the stable form, while for the unstable forms total meniscectomy is generally regarded as the treatment of choice, since the instability means that rupture of residual meniscus would be possible.	0.8011899928544782
A fourteen years old girl showed the classic signs of acrocephalosyndactyly I: dysostosis craniofacialis with hypertelorism, exophthalmus, strabism, amblyopia and cleft palate as well as syndactyly of the fingers and toes.	0.4219808224993066
The feet showed on both side a 6  cm long horny band.	0.3381585039107739

Here a pair of monozygotic twins with Dubowitz syndrome and clear-cut atopic eczema is presented.	0.352133892991551
Humeral shaft fractures can be treated either conservatively or operatively.	0.5915092168640458
Plating of the humerus is the established operative method, but recently interest has also been focussed on intramedullary nailing.	0.6092509680808175
Fifty-nine cases of humeral fractures treated with intramedullary nailing (Seidel/Marchetti-Vicenzi/Prévot) from January 1991 to December 1995 (44 fractures after trauma, 11 pathological fractures, 3 pseudarthroses, 1 re-fracture).	0.6289817496550687
Closed reduction in 55/59 cases.	0.2879571040642427

Functional postoperative treatment in all 44 cases of humeral fractures after adequate trauma.	0.4370295029696596
One poor functional result: periarticular ossification after retrograde nailing, possibly connected with long-term respiratory treatment after trauma.	0.43626122370329523
Treatment of humeral shaft fractures by intramedullary nailing is favoured in our clinic (low complication rates, excellent or good functional results, limited approaches, small scars).	0.6612771535265138
Proximal fractures should be treated by the Seidel nail (stable interlocking of the proximal fragment); very distal fractures need Prévot nailing (reaming of condylar canals).	0.5253971873322858
All other fractures of the humeral shaft can be treated by each of the implants used in our clinic.	0.8279439390867956
Pathological fractures are an excellent indication for intramedullary stabilization.	0.42656631151724644
These patients benefit from stable fixation without intense surgical trauma.	0.3224218365821565
Pseudarthrosis, according to our limited experience, seems to require plating plus bone grafting.	0.4886463680107264
Plating is also recommended if revision of the radial nerve becomes necessary.	0.47010514604773584
2-4 % of vascular injuries need operative reconstruktion.	0.7060123661633365
In polytraumatized patients the rate is even 10 %.	0.4652839663304243
Arterial vascular repair should precede venous reconstruction and orthopaedic stabilization due to limb threatening ischemia.	0.2912975749485243
Penetration or blunt vascular trauma result either in acute blood loss, ischemia or compartmental compression.	0.3946662174117304
Reperfusion syndrom leads to vital threat of patient.	0.2332075945309169
Clinical assessment, measurement of limb pressures using a Doppler device and use of duplex ultrasonography are reliable adjuncts in the rapid evaluation.	0.4088518429833726
Arteriography is rarely indicated and should be spared for patients with abnormal physical examination.	0.5154912230981561
Minimizing ischemia (6-8 h) is an important factor in maximizing limb salvage.	0.9364050144017618
Vascular repair include direct anastomosis or lateral suture repair mostly combined with primary shortening of the extremity.	0.45510431591711786
In most cases autogenous vein graft is required.	0.3839587260142995
Rethrombosis, arteriovenous fistula and pseudoaneurysms are possible complications.	0.2709293631055906
Stabilisation of the fracture has priority over vascular reconstruction.	0.5334336652511953
The initial steps to success are surgical debridement, adequate bony stabilization mostly by external fixation, revascularisation of vascular injury, immediate fascial decompression and early soft-tissue reconstruction.	0.46217450971015095
The best results are obtained when a multidiciplinary approach is used combining expertise in orthopedic surgery, vascular surgery and plastic surgery.	0.6105879697379041
In secondary prevention, statins are cost-effective and even more cost-effective than other lipid lowering drugs.	0.5741689820944034
Statins are especially favorable in patients with previous myocardial infarction compared to those with angina pectoris.	0.5789976950212219
For secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, statins should be administered generously.	0.5006628628918482
In primary prevention, statins are effective but not cost-efficient.	0.44412240108008444
Unfavorable results have to be expected especially in premenopausal women, younger patients, and in those with a low risk factor profile.	0.8787634348947415
For population based primary prevention, only dietary measures can be advocated; however, apart from a serious lack of compliance their efficiency has not yet been proven.	0.4645394641249967
Preventive measures have their own prize; in general they are considered not to prevent coronary heart disease but retard it.	0.5375065363045081
Therefore, such therapeutic interventions can be assumed not to reduce but rather to increase the "direct" medical costs.	0.7315600930386271
Furthermore, successful prevention of coronary heart disease leads, due to life-prolongation, to an increase in people out of work and in disabled patients due to age and/or disease.	0.6194443826201113
Therefore, an increase especially of the "indirect" costs for unemployment, pension, nursing homes, etc.	0.5758681373127301
Background: There are three fields where the the biochemical cardiac markers creatine kinase (CK), its isoenzyme MB (CK-MB), myoglobin, and troponin can play an important role: (1) the primary diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), (2) identification of patients suffering from unstable angina with minor myocardial damage (MMD) and consecutively increased risk for major cardiovascular events, and (3) assessment of coronary reperfusion after intravenous thrombolysis.	0.679032434688008
MRSA/MRSE infections are a major problem in hospitals and although in orthopaedic units the incidence is low awareness of this problem is necessary.	0.5953656962276518
Once a MRSA strain has been isolated the strict use of the hygiene precautions has to be applied to avoid epidemic spread of the strain.	0.5807640967778103
The patient has to be isolated.	0.5797613939010937
The staff has to use gloves and gowns whilst treating the patient.	0.31781334074791173
A antimicrobiel hand wash solution has to be used after taking off the gloves and before leaving the isolation room.	0.4547803189485424
Patient and staff have to be informed about the pathogenity and the way of infection spread so that infection precaution rules are fulfilled.	0.574158738923119
Antibiotics should only be used in clinically well defined cases and the overall use of antibiotics should be reduced to lower the incidence of MRSA/E isolates.	0.6981871333452632
The problems of an MRSA case and its successful treatment are demonstrated.	0.4514136683143235
A microphone constructed for implantation in the posterior wall of the auditory canal and a piezoelectric transducer serving as the main components of an implantable hearing aid were temporally implanted in five patients during middle ear surgery under local anesthesia.	0.6341649703064155
The microphone was positioned beneath the skin of the auditory canal such that it completely covered the microphone membrane.	0.46894798529183374
The vibratory element of the transducer was coupled to the malleus in four patients with normal ossicular chains and directly to the stapes in one patient with missing incus.	0.6478964122288786
The microphone and transducer were electrically connected with an external battery-driven signal amplifier.	0.44556419216443394
Speech material and music were presented in the operation room at a sound level of 65 dB SPL under free-field conditions.	0.44383612787259036
The patients had to estimate the quality of speech, music, and their own voice as well as the effects of bone-conducting noises.	0.8188096592937719
All patients were able to hear with the system.	0.43014796911391107
An intraoperative talk without vision contact was possible without any problems, as was understanding of numerals ("Freiburger Zahlentest").	0.5921173696729297
Perception of music was judged as "clear and undistorted with all broadband component."	0.41781485263613627
The estimation was also valid for one patient with a sensorineural hearing loss.	0.665420924271848
One patient declared the music to be "a little of unnatural."	0.43982845545372024
Bone-conducted sound was estimated as normal in two patients, better than without an implant in one patient with sensorineural hearing loss, and "somewhat metallic" in another patient.	0.7431175868519965
Hearing the own voice was considered "normal" in two cases "monotonous" in one case, and "a little bit roaring" in another case.	0.8815670842910887
An amplification factor that can be technically realized in an implantable hearing aid was necessary for one of the patients with sensorineural hearing loss to perceive music at a pleasant volume.	0.6202035150093523
On the basis of this study, essential requirements for the construction of a fully implantable hearing aid are fulfilled.	0.7710745381290555
We report a patient with metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) with a first manifestation of homicide.	0.7821395198539746
On admission the patient showed a hebephrenia-like syndrom with inappropriate affect, thought disorder and  behavioral changes.	0.4274305854296919
Magnetic resonance  tomography (MRT) findings suggested a  diagnosis of MLD, which was confirmed by a decreased activity of leucocyte arylsulfatase A and an excessive urinary sulfatide excretion.	0.6315235370552561
The cervical spondylotic myelopathy is the most frequent spinal dysfunction.	0.561296964756805
Its spontaneous course is very variable, from progress to stagnation.	0.4632871377698443
This makes prognosis and decision-making difficult for conservative or operative treatment.	0.4617423743395057
The authors attempt to provide some basis for decision-making by observing the individual course of neural dysfunction, consideration of morphometric data and the use of functional scores.	0.46838627447083525

Subject: In a 7;11 year old boy with trichotillomania (ICD-10 F63.3), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (ICD-10 F90.1), and subclinical minimal cerebral dysfunction, Methylphenidate (Ritalin) medication resulted in a remarkable improvement: unexspected interruption of trichotillomania with regrowth of hair.	0.5810828004191846
An essential feature of the known procedures for the analysis of the ECG signal is the splitting of the ECG into individual parameters which are subsequently processed in defined decision trees, neuronal networks or statistical procedures to diagnostic information.	0.5561909935851241
The correctness of the diagnostic statements thus substantially depends on the suitable selection and the exact determination of the individual criteria.	0.6274497372364022
The analysis algorithm and the expert knowledge are closely linked due to the procedure.	0.45275661338434436
This paper presents a new procedure or the evaluation of signals of medical sensor systems by the example of the ECG.	0.581854469661086
Unlike the methods used up to now, this procedure is not based on an ever more profound splitting of the ECG signal into individual features.	0.7310950044893099
Furthermore, analysis algorithm and knowledge base are separated from each other.	0.5191476838731545
The consideration underlying the procedure is that two ECGs whose leads show identical or very similar signal patterns indicate identical or at least very similar cardiological diagnoses.	0.45729439190447874
As this assumption is the basis of medical experience, it should be possible to compare the signal patterns of the leads of an unknown ECG with those of the leads of the reference ECGs from a database and to draw conclusions for the diagnosis of the unknown ECG.	0.7066301957008421
For this purpose, those ECGs are searched in an ECG database whose leads show greatest agreement with the signal pattern of the unknown ECG.	0.5028482325557763
The function of the method was established with the aid of the ECG signal database CARDIODAT with 249 ECGs for the diagnostic groups: infarcts and healthy reference persons from a data inventory of 550 ECGs.	0.552866258822477
It can be seen from the results that the presented procedure which is based on signal pattern recognition is a new approach to deriving diagnostic information from the ECG signal at least for the diagnostic group of myocardial infarcts.	0.717686467451321
Purpose: The technical conditions, the optimized scanning protocols and the facilities of virtual endoscopy (VE) are presented in an overview.	0.7122893463561513
During a 4-week ambulatory cardiacc rehabilitation program, 262 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), 235 men and 27 women, 53.6+/-10.2 years, performed 30.5+/-2,9 exercise units.	0.6893517547525913
Before and after the rehabilitation program exercise, capacity was assessed by bicycle ergometry.	0.6651270329248273
There was a significant (p<0.001) increase in the maximum exercise capacity at the end of the program (105.3+/-32.3 vs. 121.9+/-37.3 W).	0.6499601035189516
Physical work capacity on the 2.0 mmol lactate level improved (p<0.001) from 72.2+/-23.5 to 86.4+/-25.8 W, on the 2.5 mmol/l level (p<0.001) from 83.5+/-23.2 to 97.4+/-26.4 W, and on the 3.0 mmol/l level (p<0.001) from 93.1+/-23.0 to 106.6+/-26.1 W. Despite enhanced performance, heart rate remained unaltered on the 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 mmol/l lactate level.	0.7707846530966672
Furthermore, ergometric performance on predefined heart rate levels was significantly (p<0.001) increased: 85/min: from 56.0+/-24.1 to 65.8+/-24.5 W; 90/min: from 62.0+/-27.3 to 71.2+/-26 W; 95/min: from 67.2+/-26.4 to 77.5+/-27.6 W; 100/min: from 71.1+/-29.6 to 80.6+/-28.1 W; 105/min: from 69.8+/-26.2 to 81.9+/-28.2 W and 110/min: from 73.6+/-28.9 to 90.4+/-29.4 W. The results demonstrate that physical performance in patients with CAD was improved by our novel ambulatory cardiac rehabilitation program.	0.6707093606434013
This improvement included an increase in maximum as well as endurance work capacity; furthermore, this increase was accompanied by a decrease in resting and exercise heart rates.	0.5252497751434548
The results demonstrate an absolute increase of physical performance, more importantly an increase of physical performance at defined lactate levels in the presence of unchanged heart rates mediated by the rehabilitation program.	0.6176503656149168
Thus, this increase was independent of motivational factors in the patients and/or the investigators during the re-exercise test.	0.7719242599719237
On the contrary, our data demonstrate that it is based on an improvement of aerobic endurance capacity associated with a therapeutically beneficial significant decrease of heart rate for a defined workload.	0.7082684159507241
The effects were independent of pharmacological influences (e.g., -receptor antagonists).	0.7259547372043295
These findings are of clinical importance with respect to reduction of myocardial oxygen consumption in patients with CAD.	0.7193310991245235
Newborn screening programs for inborn errors of metabolism are well established in industrialized countries.	0.46304742363006957
Missed cases may be not only due to errors in specimen collection and laboratory errors but also to failures in adequate follow up.	0.4108833358715294
We report the case of a now 4-year-old girl whose classical phenylketonuria was diagnostically missed in the course of follow-up procedures of a pathological screening result 1067 µmol/l 17,6 mg% phenylalanine.	0.5594657816608893
The separation of whole blood into components is the state-of-the-art in transfusion of allogeneic blood.	0.5770890111749435
The main reasons are the negative effects of the buffy coat and the need for FFP.	0.6392042178718907
Nevertheless, especially in Germany whole blood is being rejected more and more even as autologous blood.	0.561295474478297
However, most of the negative effects of the buffy coat do not apply to autologous blood.	0.5802834978391854
Additionally, these patients usually do not develop coagulation disorders and therefore do not need plasma as a hemostatic component.	0.5877417143210073
On the other hand, separation into components of autologous blood leads to an increase of costs and to logistic problems that restrict autologous blood predeposit to a few institutions.	0.5166046702961116
Therefore, we have reviewed the literature in order to find a scientific basis for this.	0.7974038773880795
We analysed all articles listed by MEDLINE during the last 12 years that dealt with the quality of whole blood or red cell concentrates.	0.5802425873133914
In addition, all references were included that contributed relevant information to the topic.	0.5091096133574068
A total of 135 original articles, abstracts, reviews, letters or editorials were analysed that referred to standard preparations and storage media.	0.35298155906033346
In 48 papers the in vivo red cell survival was studied.	0.4631934200821329
28 of which fulfilled the prerequisites to be included into a meta-analysis.	0.5392615421289975
The following in vitro parameters were also evaluated: pH, potassium load of the units, ATP and DPG concentration of the red cells.	0.5765134732319602
Whole blood (resuspended in CPDA-1) and red cell units (stabilized in CPDA-1 or additive solutions) with a different buffy coat or leucocyte content have comparable pH values and red cell 2,3-DPG and ATP concentrations at the end of the approved storage time.	0.5286632722625034
The potassium load of a whole blood unit appears to be higher than red cell concentrates, but this is to some extent caused by the higher plasma content of whole blood and is not thought to be a clinically relevant problem for patients receiving only a few units.	0.7917292366007539
A number of studies demonstrate that dependent upon the leucocyte content of a red cell unit, leucocyte metabolites and enzymes are released and accumulate during storage.	0.40909301425974753
A detrimental influence on the integrity of the red cell membrane was found in several in vitro studies.	0.6789145580029123
Nevertheless, a significant improvement in red cell survival by leucocyte reduction was detected by only one group.	0.7622481022482477
Undoubtedly, non-hemolytic febrile transfusion reactions (NHFTR) are generally caused by an antibody-antigen interaction due to the transfusion of allogeneic buffy coat.	0.5572939273571335
On the other hand, there is some evidence that non-specific immunological mechanisms such as the release of histamine or cytokines are also capable of causing NHFTR.	0.5620967610310242
Thus, these reactions are expected to occur in autologous blood transfusion.	0.6552946250733248
However, so far, there are no data about the frequency and severity of these reactions and whether they are more likely to emerge after transfusion of blood units with a particular preparation.	0.8248954517175534
Blood transfusions can cause septic complications due to bacterial contamination of the transfused units.	0.412569204411586
These fatal but rare complications may be reduced by pre-storage filtration of blood, but there is no indication that buffy coat reduction is effective.	0.6367378806618625
Three cases with septic complications have been reported after autologous transfusion, in two of which red cell concentrates (at least one was free of buffy coat) had been used.	0.9196683427201164
Thus, there is no justification for the conclusion that the risk of septic complications is increased by transfusion of whole blood.	0.6678188513978919
After all, whole blood and red cell concentrates exhibit only minor differences in relevant in vitro parameters.	0.5314707167137595
Hence, a higher incidence of adverse effects following the transfusion of autologous whole blood compared to autologous red cell concentrations is unlikely.	0.5281162156399555
Therefore, the 24 h in vivo recovery is considered to be the most valid criterion to assess the quality of red cell preparations.	0.6615716043880872
Physical therapy can support geriatric rehabilitation in contributing to better health status, mobility, and quality of life.	0.5408188643182988
However, the central focus of this contribution is not on illness-specific aspects of physical therapy but on power and stamina training.	0.5884431670737146
These two training methods are of special importance for geriatric rehabilitation since most patients are admitted due to related problems and these two methods do imply specific risk factors for the rehabilitation process.	0.6033377844800893
The spectrum of physical adaptation processes supported by power and stamina training is described and scientifically evaluated.	0.45146526314067525
Even in higher age groups positive training effects are possible.	0.3175184281106164
Adequate usage of these training methods contributes to increased competence and a minimization of risks in daily life.	0.40316237682123157
The arthroscopic extraarticular Bankart procedure tries to imitate the open Bankart procedure.	0.29153384499276
An anterior-inferior transmuscular approach through the subscapular muscle permits to implant self-locking tacks into the anterior inferior third of the glenoid rim.	0.46449061927475066
The extraarticular location of the implants makes a superomedial capsular shift possible, if required.	0.5846259012622969
A total of 257 arthroscopic repairs following traumatic recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation have been carried out between 1992 and 1996.	0.406066613808158

Clinical and radiological follow up was possible in 165 patients.	0.6719597628821738
According to the Rowe score 69,7 % were classified as excellent, 10,9 % as good, 9,7 % fair and 9,7 % poor.	0.7615542101708344
Postoperative complications: the recurrence rate was 9,7 %, allergic reactions representing a foreign body reaction to the synthetic material were seen in 5 cases (3 %) and a frozen shoulder in 6 cases 3,6 %).	0.7625005605919516
61 % of the patients involved in overhead or contact sports returned to their preoperative sport activities.	0.6759935147929198
Contrast-enhanced 3D MR angiography permits comprehensive assessment of the arterial system in the chest, abdomen und lower extremities.	0.663734786532901
The method combines intravenous bolus application of a non-nephrotoxic, paramagnetic, extracellular contrast agent with the acquisition of a fast 3D data set.	0.4670473849295912
High contrast between the vascular lumen and surrounding tissues, inherent three-dimensionality and the ability to collect image data in the chest and abdomen under apnea conditions all contribute to excellent image quality.	0.5230095229009912
Contrast-enhanced 3D MRA is being employed in many centers throughout the world for the evaluation of various arterial pathologies.	0.5101926359979466
This review provides a technical overview and critically discusses the clinical applications in the chest, abdomen and lower extremities based upon the available literature and several clincial examples.	0.5808920961016938
The indications for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on prosthetic heart valve recipients remain critical.	0.4822615574782381
A generalized contraindication for MRI is doubtful.	0.34338378145523896
Some diagnostic questions such as interests in pathologies of the posterior cranial fossa, spinal abscesses, and internal derangements for the knee, strongly recommend the advantages of MRI versus all other radiological diagnostic techniques.	0.596239917756592
MRI can directly affect patients with prosthetic valves in three ways by: 1) movement or dislodgment of the prosthesis, 2) heating, and 3) arrhythmias induced by electric currents, and indirectly by distortion of the image and its subsequent misinterpretation.	0.6415313097305179
Present literature that concerns the safety considerations of current values appears to be incomplete.	0.38017963969820734
Therefore, a survey of twenty-five valve manufacturers with regard to compatibility, safety or contraindication for MRI on their respective prosthetic heart valves was performed in 1998.	0.6683576159222075
Those manufacturers who distribute most of the valves in Europe confirmed the safety of MRI.	0.4692252532540581
However, some gave their assurances based on inadequate data, or assigned all responsibility to the physician.	0.6055546111139622
Some companies did not give any assurance for MRI safety or failed to respond to our enquiry.	0.3588623858131921
Two valve manufacturers warned against performing MRI on certain prostheses.	0.24505341353298468
Based on our 1998 questionnaire, the technical issues, the clinical circumstances, the prerequisites and criteria for and the definition of safety standards for MRI on prosthetic heart valve recipients are presented in this paper.	0.8592310959840214
Argyrophilic grain disease (AGD) is a frequently occurring degenerative illness of the aging human brain.	0.5897722238701688
It is accompanied by progressive pathological alterations of the cytsokeleton which are traceable to an abnormal phosphorylation of the microtubule associated tau protein.	0.3936541067115756
Histologically, it is possible with the help of suitable staining techniques to identify pathognomonic spindle-shaped cellular inclusions (argyrophilic grains).	0.5773037769793751
These cellular inclusions display a typical cortical as well as subcortical distribution pattern.	0.36246609727344575
The goal of the present study is the retrospective evaluation of the clinical findings from 53 individuals with neuropathologically demonstrable AGD-related changes of the brain.	0.8679987986794545
Nearly one-half of the cases (49%) was classifiable as demented in accordance with DSM IV-criteria.	0.6128257495843282
Moreover, the frequency of the dementia increased significantly in relation to the growing severity of the AGD-associated pathological cytoskeletal degeneration.	0.6386695520765306
These results confirm the assumption that AGD can cause degenerative changes ranging from cognitive impairment all the way to dementia.	0.5215551110385208
They also underscore the necessity of further prospective studies pertaining to the clinical aspects of this still enigmatic disease.	0.5781691001549628
The major problems in the treatment of open fractures with high blood loss are hypothermia acidosis and coagulopathy.	0.5708262137924788
By improving the standards of polytrauma management and using massive transfusion systems, which should help to avoid those complications, the indication for primary limb salvage under hypovolemic shock conditions is greatly increased.	0.6361977480946367
The following case of an grade 3 open fracture of the femur with severe soft-tissue damage, including vascular lesions, with consecutive massive transfusion, should demonstrate that the cardiac-respiratory system can still be stabilized, even if a surgical solution seems impossible.	0.7684503181157797
Annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma is mostly found in middle aged women in skin areas exposed to sunlight.	0.3582035021131404
Our 17-year-old female patient had a widespread reddish-brown lesion on the abdomen that met the histological criteria for annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma.	0.4736620278237427
However, the clinical findings and the localization were uncommon.	0.9435025309019761
UV light was excluded as a trigger.	0.430219581782056
Other, still unknown, factors that might change antigenicity of elastic fibres must be considered.	0.5426640217296229
Spontaneous resolution suggests a transient influence of such factors.	0.33496065374836903
Differential diagnosis includes skin disorders with elastolysis; discrimination especially from mid-dermal elastolysis is not well defined.	0.4106953212518548
Traumatic instability of the sternoclavicular joint is a rare diagnosis.	0.6611313560006158
It is usually treated by different bandaging techniques without the possibility of early functional aftercare.	0.4807020115159723
In the period betweeen 1 January 1996 and 31 December 1998, a total of eight patients with unstable sternoclavicular joints requiring surgical treatment were treated with Balser plates.	0.6558518679996038
The population comprised sevenanterior and one posterior dislocations.	0.25428815080676626
A 81-year-old man presented with massive hemoptysis and dyspnea.	0.4573712336596167
Results of chest radiography and computer tomography were highly suspicious for a large right-sided tumor of the bronchus with impression of the right main bronchus.	0.6041444165263564
Because of clinical worsening the patient was transferred to our department of pulmonology.	0.7085230950503699
The patient died of unappeasable hemoptysis the next day.	0.5559538026988096
At autopsy we found a 2-cm-diameter tumor of the proximal trachea as the source of massive bleeding and blood aspiration.	0.7063710149865267
Histological examination confirmed the tumor to be an epithelioid angiosarcoma of the trachea, which was a primary as no other tumor manifestation was detected.	0.7115422714232111
The entity of epithelioid angiosarcoma as a primary tumor of the trachea, to our knowledge, has not yet been reported.	0.7683890948429621
The benefits of epidural analgesia are well known, but it is not well understood which types of urologic surgery benefit most from epidural analgesia.	0.6838350643996763
In this study, the effects and side effects of prolonged epidural analgesia are prospectively examined and analysed on 172 adult patients in three different operation groups.	0.6459205147809518
An epidural infusion of local anaesthetic combined with an opioid and adrenaline was given for a period of 5-7 days.	0.753741436294147
There was no difference between the groups with respect to the effectiveness of the analgesia and patients' perception of the treatment.	0.8176057752859948
Mobilization differed, as expected, between the groups, however even after the most major surgery (e. g. cystectomy with bladder substitution), mobilization was impressively unproblematic.	0.7588529199668841
Retarded return of regular intestinal function after the transperitoneal operation and partly after lumbotomy compared with the extraperitoneal operation depended on which operation was performed and the amount of analgesia given.	0.5082367370687396
The side effects such as sedation, nausea and pruritis were conditional partly on the opiate and partly on the intervention.	0.4817119791819415
Up to 11 % showed slight muscular weakness of the lower limbs as a specific side effect of the local anaesthetic.	0.9107171564736141
Complications: One patient died of cerebral hypoxy due to an initially undetected subdural catheter placement complicated by severe pre-existent carotid stenosis.	0.5728408981352507
In four patients, the epidural analgesia had to be stopped because of catheter migration.	0.7006726111544362
There was no clinical evidence of hematoma, abscess or permanent neurological damage.	0.5450121313031012
Epidural analgesia works well in terms of analgesia, mobilization and patient satisfaction, bearing in mind the potential side effects and complications.	0.5465691456364519
It can be recommended for lumbotomy and long transperitoneal operations however not for extraperitoneal interventions in the lower abdomen such as radical prostatectomy.	0.5423774453638278
High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) provides excellent contrast between osseous structures, air and soft tissue in conjunction with high spatial resolution.	0.508195419418296
Therefore, thin-section HRCT with bone window setting is the method of choice for the examination of the middle ear structures.	0.6637406704213551
The indications are acute and chronic inflammatory changes, cholesteatoma and tumor, the "postoperative middle ear", and malformations.	0.673638277159012
In most cases, HRCT enables differentiation between inflammatory changes, cholesteatoma, and tumor.	0.5679679603745532
The excellent depiction of subtle osseous details enables the identification of erosions of the ossicles or of the bony walls of the mastoid cells, of osseous defects of the tegmen, of the bony labyrinth, and of the tympanic course of the facial canal.	0.792559590797692
In addition, HRCT enables excellent depiction of reconstructions of the ossicles or prosthesis of the ossicles.	0.5007634399768126
Although HRCT is the first method of choice, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may provide additional information and lead to a more accurate diagnosis in some cases.	0.719859245140494
This is explained by the excellent soft tissue contrast provided by MRI.	0.5258686912267773
In addition, MRI offers the possibility of using various pulse sequences and the administration of IV contrast material.	0.513417962940453
Therefore, MRI may allow the differentiation between inflammatory changes, cholesteatoma, and tumor in those cases in which accurate diagnosis cannot be made by HRCT.	0.7591548329414674
The differentiation between a meningocele or meningoencephalocele and other entities such as tumors or cholesteatoma can be established by MRI.	0.48164960010011637
Furthermore, MRI can accurately depict cases of labyrinthitis or of neuritis of the facial nerve or of intracranial disease caused by middle ear processes, while this is not always possible by HRCT.	0.6565236133565882
Morbidity and mortality after emergency procedures in 105 patients with perforated colonic diverticulitis were evaluated in a retrospective study.	0.646864164973781
In different stages of diverticulitis (Hinchey classification: I, 8.6 %; II, 14.3 %; III, 57.1 %; IV, 20.0 %) mortality was 12.4 %.	0.75363107774616
Preoperative sepsis syndrome with leucopenia and disturbed liver function, cardiac risk factors and obesity were independent prognostic factors in multiple logistic regression.	0.5724487155030075
Accompanied by immunosuppression the mortality rate remarkably increased to 33 %.	0.43491936090444566
The stage of peritonitis showed no influence on the prognosis.	0.6037620298272466
In multivariate analysis, surgical procedure (primary resection 12.4 %, Hartmann's procedure 61.9 %, non-resection procedures 25.7 %) showed influence only on increased general complications.	0.6219007996993124
The role of laparoscopic cholecystectomy on patients with histologically confirmed acute cholecystitis is still controversial.	0.5986897958698122
From January 1992 to December 1996, 228 cholecystectomies were performed for acute cholecystitis and a total of 104 patients were operated on conventionally and 124 patients underwent laparoscopic surgery.	0.5013171034370014
In a prospective study we compared the conventional with the laparoscopic technique.	0.6806821684354609
The results indicated that in 19 patients (15.3 %) treated initially with the laparoscopic technique, a switch to laparotomy was required.	0.7335050004647192
The operating duration was lower for conventional cholecystectomy (75 min versus 95 min).	0.5207299633022928
However, surgical and nonsurgical complication rates were similar in both groups.	0.6582176575874349
The period of hospitalization was shorter in laparoscopic operations.	0.5346469706772468
According to these results we believe that laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with acute cholecystitis is a safe and effective procedure.	0.7165047777599758
The patients will benefit from the advantages of laparoscopic surgery without increased morbidity.	0.6226861945706431
The sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) is one of the most striking developments in the treatment of melanoma.	0.7278180292612264
Since the first report by Morton et al.	0.551800678452912
in 1992, the method has been refined, and its use has increased.	0.8605525246496137
Introduced as an alternative to elective lymph node dissection (ELND), it has rapidly made its way into clinical practice.	0.6786643167582451
SLND allows precise pathologic staging through removal and analysis of a limited number of nodes (false-negative rate < 2 %).	0.5699590721504629
It distinguishes patients with clinically occult nodal disease from those with tumor-free regional basin who would not benefit from radical dissection.	0.5163456284638211
However, the SLND is still an experimental procedure with yet unproven utility.	0.575012859217885
Although children are injured everyday through accidents, road traffic, leisure or sports activities, internal lesions of the knee joint due to the trauma are rare.	0.5695389458137136
Diagnose and therapy follow rather empirical than analytical patterns.	0.25483203021093465
A retrospective, controlled study evaluates and recommends ways of treatment.	0.5115247711509829
Traumatic internal lesions of the knee where analysed in 76 children up to age 16.	0.5927090179415261
The pattern of injury changed with increasing age, the trauma remaining the same.	0.5807525278422653
Most common where injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).	0.3440743616224988
Main cause where sports activities.	0.172751214819423
Operative treatment seems to be the appropriate treatment.	0.8499355736087391
Osseous avulsions of the cruciates and collateral ligaments showed good results after transosseous refixation with a suture.	0.3959152511532592
