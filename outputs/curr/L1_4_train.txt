The only substantial question that has arisen is the legislative basis.	0.8678731721290008
I can go into that in detail if the honourable Member would like but there is no doubt that we are on all fours with the Ombudsman on this important issue.	1.3085545364722393
We will be happy to incorporate Mr Patten' s notes into the bibliography, as another bedside book for the Members to bear in mind.	1.2289693864537128
As the author is not present, Question No 32 lapses.	0.6944629154414912
I apologise to Mr Vitorino for this parliamentary discourtesy. I am sorry.	1.289571044178157
According to the Rules of Procedure, you are not required to reply.	1.0884300584115976
I wish you a good evening.	0.8459496663846336
Second Part	-0.0
Questions to Mr Nielson, who is replaced by Mr Patten	1.220728807584857
Can I first of all emphasise how sorry my colleague, Mr Nielson, was that he could not be here but the honourable Members who are concerned about these development questions will know how important his mission is, trying to ensure that our agreement with South Africa survives.	1.354039804490932
The Commission is prepared to look at the possibility of making an introduction to gender and development, part of the so-called induction courses for new staff, something that has been done already but not, I admit, on a regular basis.	1.2276606526422196
The training of staff moving to the delegations in the different regions is another entry point.	1.0034589489417498
The training then would be automatically performed without being compulsory.	0.783207419769303
We also aim to include training in these issues in the basic training that our officials receive in project cycle management.	1.0121710089137532
As far as possible, we want to see this sort of training automatically built into programmes at the outset, instead of having to be tackled separately and later.	1.2589865452349782
My own view as a former development minister is that these issues should be mainstreamed themselves and tackled at the heart of training and not turned into a sort of optional add-on.	1.033835940892283
The quest for equality should permeate the work of the Directorate-General for Development at all levels.	0.9659081394723789
It is not to be brought in as a "sort of optional add-on" .	1.1617804036105128
This must naturally lead to a reformulation of development goals and strategies, together with a transformation of institutions and processes so that both women' s and men' s priorities and needs are better reflected.	1.125982986608282
In addition, measures must be taken to combat differences on the grounds of gender.	1.3080990133136992
Equality must permeate not only projects and programmes but also all overarching goals, action plans and strategies.	1.01103322028025
It would appear that we are in agreement about this.	1.2864603664118957
However, responsibility for ensuring that due attention is given to equality lies with departmental and unit managers.	1.223087719657356
If the latter do not have the required professional competence, then nothing will happen and gender mainstreaming will no longer be a priority.	1.3199187098621388
Extremely few members of the Directorate-General for Development, that is to say unit managers and more senior managers, have taken part in the gender courses that have been organised.	1.1950467954308979
Only one manager has participated in gender training, and for half a day.	1.1490592673340247
That is naturally unacceptable.	0.5379327328376382
What is the Commission prepared to do to ensure that unit managers and more senior managers go through the necessary gender training?	1.0125106509750956
Gender has in fact been included in the compulsory introductory course for new employees, but then with only one to two hours devoted to it on each course.	1.207332736834147
This limited training element has, however, been removed from all introductory courses which have taken place in recent times.	1.1812602387321989
As I point out in my question, one to two days, and not one to two hours, need to be devoted to the subject.	1.4139881653372537
My question is this: is the Commission really prepared to comply with the adopted guidelines for gender mainstreaming at the Directorate-General for Development?	1.0570477328766121
Well I certainly take gender mainstreaming seriously and so does my colleague Commissioner Nielson.	0.8434130483885267
I must not go on about books, but I have just been reading the book by David Landis Barnhill on what makes some countries prosperous and some countries less prosperous and it is interesting to see there the importance that he attaches to gender issues, in the economic prosperity and political stability of societies, going back millennia.	1.3606491006515689
Secondly, in my view, while the training that we are talking about should not be compulsory - after all there is no compulsory training on anything in the Commission - it should be essential. And, since it should be essential, I would hope that everybody would make certain that they had adequate gender training.	1.6439725249605115
That goes for everybody at whatever level of seniority.	0.7418858626208499
It is not something which more senior officials can deem appropriate for their juniors but think that they are too grown-up or too senior to receive themselves.	1.1398632820239114
Thirdly, one of the best approaches to this issue is to integrate gender as an important and cross-cutting issue into the most popular courses for development officials and above all perhaps for the project cycle management course which is key to good management of projects on the ground.	1.299521717127351
So I sympathise very much with what the honourable Member has said.	0.7842143523213001
I hope the approach that we are following both demonstrates practicality and the imperative of giving this the attention which it deserves.	1.1134319150903773
Since 1991, the Community has provided significant financial support to the New Independent States including the countries of central Asia.	1.4960285470546233
The major part of European Union aid has been provided under the TACIS programme.	1.0332768607701295
In 1998 and 1999 Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan received technical assistance of EUR 75 million.	0.8224302029734305
This assistance has delivered benefits in all sectors, in particular agriculture, infrastructure development, the private economy and the strengthening of institutions.	1.2844212017758647
Security considerations have prevented Tajikistan from benefiting fully from TACIS but a rehabilitation programme of EUR 7.2 million has been in place in 1998 and 1999.	1.0206636104883051
In addition to national programmes, the European Union has supported important regional actions in the energy, transport and environmental sectors.	1.3917528909140666
Food security programmes in central Asia began in 1996, following two previous years when the European Union provided food aid in kind.	1.2562359309079771
These programmes have benefited Kyrgyzstan and to a more limited extent, Tajikistan.	1.08076308493226
Funding for NGO programmes in Tajikistan amounted to EUR 7.42 million in 1998 and 1999.	0.7521856326993646
Over the same period, Kyrgyzstan received EUR 17 million.	0.5705114308822604
Since 1993 the Commission's European Community Humanitarian Office, ECHO, has been active in supporting the most vulnerable groups and sectors in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.	1.1957135097725033
In 1998 and 1999 EUR 3.8 million was granted to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan received over EUR 35 million, mainly for food, medical supplies, water and sanitation.	1.0482740169909008
Frequent monitoring and situation assessments have shown that European Union assistance is contributing to the stability of these countries and therefore the ongoing peace process.	1.1766773588258432
Mr President, Commissioner, there is a risk of Central Asia and the Caspian Sea becoming the Balkans of the 21st Century.	1.0229691463006612
That is why it is imperative to stabilise the two major states of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in particular. That is why I would like to ask you what you are actually able to do within your own sphere of competence, how the negotiations with regard to the partnership agreement with these two countries are going, that is, with regard to political relations that is.	1.4513025131061323
Of course, that falls within your remit; my next question falls within Mr Nielson' s remit in that it concerns environmental cooperation, in particular matters pertaining to water and the problems surrounding the cotton monocultures, which are the cause of great aridity.	1.4314660536450157
We were able, at the Istanbul Summit a couple of weeks ago, to meet and have discussions with some of the Central Asian republics.	1.2334939561073388
I am very anxious that we should strengthen our relationship with them.	1.2691629468609982
I can send the honourable Member, if he would like, a detailed breakdown of exactly where we stand on the negotiation of partnership and cooperation agreements with each of the Central Asian republics.	1.1897175641369169
Obviously everyone will hope that his prediction of what may happen in the future is on the gloomy side.	1.0936254802551055
But I have no doubt at all that he is right to point to the strategic importance of Central Asia.	1.3543861254843197
I have heard the honourable Member talk in the past about the Caucasus as well.	1.2026531893330044
He is absolutely right to say that a Union which talks about conflict prevention should be looking at what it can do in these particular areas to ensure that there is not the sort of conflict in the future which has caused so much devastation in the Balkans and which has cost us a great deal more than we might have had to spend otherwise, had we taken more pre-emptive measures if those had been possible.	1.3699351203371541
So the honourable Member's remarks about the strategic importance of these regions are extremely well made.	1.0023719186750644
We are contributing to programmes in the region which have some ecological impact.	1.0828285309914254
Our food programmes are directly related to structural reforms in agriculture as well as poverty alleviation.	0.9581262591780404
Those programmes themselves are intended to ensure that agriculture has a more soundly based position in those societies and does not consist simply of raping the land.	0.8555025811194401
There is an ecological aspect which we should continue to give priority to.	1.3209121474855814
We also take good note of the fact that the Member who has asked the question has applauded the Commissioner' s answer.	1.2488581258987228
This is not the usual state of affairs.	1.050000363587294
And furthermore the Commissioner has not quoted from his bibliography this time.	0.9552093795437755
Thank you very much, Mr Patten, for your interventions today.	1.2616407995330212
Question No 35 by (H-0778/99):	0.7681010684412177
Subject: Greek action plan for employment According to the findings of the evaluation of Action Plans for Employment, Greece and Italy are the main targets for criticism from the Commission for not properly carrying out employment support measures and policies.	1.2794842548508034
The report states that in Greece and Italy targets for improving ?employability? have not yet been reached and it is doubtful whether the policies to be implemented will enable the guidelines on preventing and dealing with long-term unemployment to be complied with.	1.2243368706633464
The report also comments that in Greece there are no plans for medium to long-term measures aimed at reducing employment tax and insurance charges, or for the satisfactory use of European Social Fund resources to support employment policies, and, in addition, that there are no exact employment figures.	1.381367470493138
Could the Commission say whether the Greek Government has made any specific commitments on how to tackle the problems of youth and long-term unemployment, and what these commitments are? Has the government legislated for and put into place a suitable system for pinpointing, recording and monitoring fluctuations in unemployment, or are most of the measures perhaps still limited to counting those out of work?	1.244814992895013
As far as Mr Papayannakis' question is concerned, in the 1999 Action Plan for Employment, the Commission proposed certain recommendations for Greece with a view to improving the efficiency of the Action Plan for Employment.	1.3636474171514175
The most important recommendations related to the need to improve efforts to reform public sector services, where problems exist, improve the statistical monitoring system and apply preventive policies in accordance with guidelines 1 and 2 of the Action Plan for Employment.	1.1327827155569314
The Greek Government introduced two specific programmes in 1999 as part of its employment policy: "Yes to Work" and "Back to Work" .	1.1465435550500902
We do not yet have the final results of these programmes and cannot yet tell if the quantitative objectives were achieved.	1.214534320262829
The Greek Government acknowledges the problem of its being unable to record human resources entering and leaving work and is therefore committed, firstly, to restructuring public sector employment services in Greece, secondly, to setting up efficient employment promotion centres - this programme has already started but has not yet been completed - and, thirdly, to introducing a system of electronic employment cards and using suitable IT systems to monitor all these policies.	1.2699712540855461
In the new programme submitted for the period from 2000 to 2006, which is being financed from the Social Fund, both the resources and the policies should be used, with the Commission' s support, to implement the objectives which I referred to earlier.	1.5860006956267252
The Commission will keep a close watch on the Greek Government in order to ensure that it honours the commitments which it has made.	1.2771908733202684
Thank you, Commissioner for your reply.	1.1896899309373574
However, our current situation is as follows: at 11.3%, we have the second highest unemployment in Europe, which was not previously the case, we have the biggest increase in unemployment, we spend less than anyone else on the unemployed, i.e. less than 1% of GDP, while other countries, such as France, Belgium and Germany spend 3-4%, and it is not clear how the money received from the Social Fund has been used, inter alia, to combat unemployment.	1.4847637102576716
You tell me that you, as the Commission, have made recommendations.	1.6061807910716315
I understand and welcome that and I hope that the recommendations will be adhered to.	1.0071098576795818
However, my question for a very long time has been this: what happened with previous policies?	1.4592091845123907
Did anyone find work?	0.4408986187707975
How many people found work?	0.7310629934304355
If you cannot tell us for this year, then last year and the year before.	1.3433678934205389
What has been done about training?	1.1048138470810454
Is the purpose of the famous training centres to provide jobs for instructors or trainees?	0.8186343508278573
Do we have any figures?	0.8267761969893916
In other words, do we have ways of checking what is happening with this government policy in Greece?	1.2274164599886388
Mr Papayannakis, the only answer I can give you is that the Greek Government does indeed need to step up efforts to introduce computerised statistical records and to set up structures so that the programmes implemented have the quantitative results which you mentioned, and so that monitoring can be carried out and used as a basis for formulating policies.	1.2264087777514667
Greece has seen an increase in the employment rate and, as far as I can see, an increase in productivity.	1.3109947401726432
The action which the Commission can take relates to the specific guidelines.	1.408555431877178
As you know, there are 22 guidelines on which each country is evaluated.	1.1318995366102704
They concern access to training, the ratio of men to women with access to training, and special action for the long-term unemployed.	1.071912055181569
The Commission will endeavour, for all these specific guidelines, to quantify the data and to obtain specific information based on the implementation of the new Community framework for 2000 to 2006.	1.5253049575392796
Question No 36 by (H-0782/99):	0.6265326349062238
Subject: Danish early retirement pension scheme Will the Commission state whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme has been approved in its entirety and whether there are disagreements between Denmark and the Commission in other areas of social policy?	1.315122452284045
The Danish pension scheme, the Efterløn, only allows people resident in Denmark and people who have completed the required period of employment in Denmark to retire.	1.2178126669808507
Some workers have complained to the European Commission because they do not have the right to retire.	1.3447861977803663
The Danish authorities do not consider that they are obliged under Community law to pay this compensation to workers taking early retirement who do not meet the conditions required under Danish law.	1.0225852268048892
It should be noted that the current regulation on social security systems does not at present refer to the question of early retirement and the Commission has proposed certain amendments to the regulation which are, however, still pending before the Council.	1.3923346927581817
There is, as yet, no European Court case law on Efterløn, but it could validly be argued that the residence requirement is incompatible with general clauses now in force banning discrimination on the grounds of nationality.	1.236338192719465
The Commission services set up a procedure for joint meetings and discussions with the Danish Government with a view to finding a common language and a common approach.	1.3095610974661327
The last meeting on the subject was held in November 1999 and we are waiting for the Commission services' final proposals on whether or not infringement proceedings will be instituted against Denmark.	1.2745839707134419
I noticed that the Commissioner did not give a direct answer to the question of whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme as a whole has been approved by the Commission, but it was indirectly apparent that the answer was that it has not been.	1.2233769866000037
I should like to ask the Commissioner expressly to confirm that the scheme has not been approved by the Commission.	1.1429204815184664
The Commissioner also more than hinted, of course, that a lot of consideration was being given to bringing the whole issue of the Danish early retirement pension scheme before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg, specifically on the grounds that the scheme actually discriminates against non-Danish wage earners who are unable to fulfil the conditions, due to the fact that they have not been in paid work for the period required under the Danish system.	1.216320761905647
I should like to ask the Commissioner if she can provide any approximate deadlines in connection with this matter, for it is a problem which needs clarification in the context of the Danish socio-political debate.	1.3079580775686845
So I should be grateful if the Commissioner could enlarge upon this question.	0.7834996045754455
Honourable Member, I should just like to stress that both Denmark and numerous other Member States are having problems interpreting the directives and transposing them into national law.	1.2856084713167069
This is one such case and discussions are under way between the Danish Government and the Commission in order to find the best possible solution to the matter, to the benefit of the workers who meet the requirements and who, as things stand, have a right to this pension.	1.4467224907273173
Briefly, just to follow on from that last point, I invite the Commission to make it absolutely clear that the Commission's objections, such as they are, would not in any way infringe the rights of Danish nationals to benefit from this scheme, but simply that the Commission has a concern, which it has the right to have under Community law, to ensure that the scheme applies to all EU citizens who qualify.	1.6357296697144894
I think that the answer is brief and clear.	1.1642970085604396
Of course it is as you say.	1.0001852965709646
There will be no problem with Danish nationals within Denmark, that is not where the problem lies.	1.3083210042498699
The problem is with Danish nationals or other nationals residing outside Denmark.	0.9616117236191192
Question No 37 by (H-0791/99):	0.6285942998179878
Subject: Working time directive Can the Commission say what action it proposes taking to ensure a level of protection, equivalent to that provided by the 1993 working time directive, for non-consultant hospital doctors, who were excluded from that directive and again from the proposal for a Council amending directive (COM(98)0662-C4-0715/98 - 98/0318(SYN))?	1.245963433202244
A proposal has been drafted for a directive to amend the directive on the working time of non-consultant hospital doctors.	1.1174600520006102
The content of the proposal concerns the average 48-hour working week of doctors, with the possibility, following negotiation, of increasing it to 54 hours.	1.3663480311671068
The Council, Commission and Parliament are all agreed on the content but there is disagreement on the transitional period for implementing the directive.	1.2750983892287737
Parliament has proposed 4 years, the Commission 7 and the Council 13.	1.5966744241887423
This proposal is still being discussed by the Council and Parliament on the basis of the codecision procedure.	1.3259576549758612
Although there is this disagreement, I should stress that all three institutions agree on the content and that every effort is being made to find a common approach to this particularly important and sensitive question which concerns an exceptionally large number of working doctors throughout Europe.	1.3669632268583711
Question No 38 by (H-0805/99):	0.6366981912758939
Subject: Measures to advance gender equality One of the working groups of Commissioners announced by President Prodi has as its objective the promotion of measures to advance gender equality (gender mainstreaming).	1.155061769745857
Which Commissioners are members of this group?	1.2164054328280098
How many meetings of the group have been held to date?	1.1773852337864703
What concrete measures have been discussed?	0.7719827235771612
This question covers several individual matters.	0.5472261450182032
It refers to the special Commission working group dealing with questions of equality.	0.840660473338258
The Commissioners taking part are President Prodi, Vice-President Kinnock, Mr Reding and myself.	1.1576211526096647
The meetings of the working group are open and the first meeting was held on 11 January 2000.	1.127907961685947
Three serious issues were discussed: the first was the first discussion on the fifth programme for women, of which I gave an initial evaluation, the second issue was the report by Mr Busquin on the investigation into the participation of women in research and science, and the third involved Mr Kinnock, who reported to the working group on efforts being made to take account of the gender equality dimension in the overall reforms currently taking place in the Community.	1.3224730557968822
Thank you very much, Commissioner, for your reply, although I regret the fact that this working group has taken so long to meet, since this matter is of the greatest importance.	1.4961718044796268
We trusted this Commission, from the outset, to begin work on all issues relating to greater equality for men and women.	1.2806206492424073
I hope that, in the future, things will change and meetings will become frequent, because there are many issues which require the attention of the Commission in order to speed up and conclude, as quickly as possible, those measures which will promote greater equality between men and women.	1.354665694669327
Mrs Avilés-Perea, that was an exhortation rather than a question.	1.1715817673047995
But if the Commissioner wishes to offer doctrine or good intentions ...	1.054680378568218
Allow me to say just one word. I agree that the working group should have met earlier but at least, once it did, important decisions were taken straight away.	1.399663312510725
Question No 39 by (H-0807/99):	0.6266593342785471
Subject: Community EQUAL initiative On 13 October 1999, the Commission adopted the Community's EQUAL initiative, the aim of which is transnational cooperation to find and develop new means of combating discrimination and inequalities in the labour market with the focus on asylum-seekers.	1.3213762514019973
Under this umbrella, each Member State is to submit proposals in the form of a Community initiative programme for that particular country.	1.3580462725169014
What criteria will the Commission use to approve or reject the Member States' programmes?	1.2122638290998218
Which Community body will control the funding of the steering group and the monitoring committee and verify that the programme is carried out exactly and correctly?	1.0710314163412344
The European Social Fund contribution for the period 2000-2006 will total 2 487 billion euro. As the EQUAL initiative is a joint funding venture with the Member States, what will Greece's contribution amount to?	1.2714634824891222
The EQUAL initiative is not restricted to certain groups of people.	0.9309077187110462
Its purpose is to combat discrimination in the workplace.	0.697231255250824
The decision on this initiative was taken in Berlin, where it was decided to take account of professional groups of asylum seekers and to include them in its action.	1.347057356642936
This is an important aspect of this initiative.	0.9584988488504672
The Community initiative programme in each Member State must comply with the regulation. This is the same as the Social Fund regulation, i.e. EQUAL comes under the Social Fund regulation.	1.4629032663388635
It has been submitted to Parliament and we expect Parliament' s opinion next month.	1.304498054295357
I should like to stress that the EQUAL initiative satisfies national requirements and national plans defined in accordance with agreed European strategy.	1.1161352111914915
The Member States, i.e. the national governments, have primary responsibility for setting up the joint agencies, submitting proposals, selecting the proposals which the programmes will implement and carrying out primary control.	1.1614742110690777
Within the European Commission, the Directorate-General for Employment is responsible for implementation, while financial control is the responsibility of the Directorate-General for Financial Control, the Anti-Fraud Office and the European Court of Auditors.	1.4255877891097628
The last question concerns the amount granted.	0.772886918743063
Greece has been granted ECU 98 million. The contribution commitment is 80%, rising to an 85% contribution from the initiative for the island regions, especially the remote Greek islands, and a contribution by Greece of 15%.	1.297753194973787
Mr President, I feel that the guidelines for the Community EQUAL initiative, especially the four actions described in it, will result both in complicated bureaucracy and, paradoxically, a non-transparent structure.	1.4041110408426913
For example, one wonders how a development partnership will prove its cooperative spirit or its representative capacity, as required by action 2 in paragraph 33 of the guidelines.	1.1893176883654317
At the same time, the obligation to engage in transnational cooperation, the complicated demands of the plan and the implementation of a development partnership inevitably require large structures, as these are the only structures which can meet such demands.	1.3223890176554165
However, this contradicts the stated aim of the general objectives for decentralised action plans at the level of local authorities and rural areas. However, at the same time, participation by those actually discriminated against, such as asylum seekers, immigrants and so on, is rendered impossible or merely symbolic.	1.3058883422993792
Finally, if you consider the overall amount, which is on the small side, - EUR 2.8 billion for 15 Member States - and how ambitious the objectives are, I am afraid that all we shall succeed in doing is to prove that unemployment is a bad thing.	1.4501458807787642
First let me say that it would be a great help to us, now that we have reached the stage where this is being processed by Parliament, if you could make specific proposals which we could take into account.	1.470769879157177
Secondly, I have to say that the aim of the EQUAL initiative is not to reduce unemployment, it cannot possibly deal with the issue of reducing unemployment, or to support an increase in employment.	1.5148752325785755
That is the job of the European Strategy for Employment and the Social Fund, which have huge sums of money and exceptionally large resources at their disposal, especially for countries like Greece.	1.4410953446127241
The EQUAL initiative has a specific mission. To encourage, to assist promotion, to create statistics, to create studies and agencies to support those sections of the population which suffer discrimination.	1.5288633585300393
So what we are looking for is cooperation between local groups, between local authorities and between countries in order to exchange experiences; that is mainly what we are looking for, and for experience to be transferred from one country to another so that it can be emulated.	1.3851097047835235
This is the philosophy behind the initiative; the budget is commensurate with it and our aim is for development agencies, non-governmental organisations and local authorities to be involved as much as possible, so that it can get as close to the people as possible.	1.3724689567178405
Question No 40 by (H-0808/99):	0.6252482926319026
Subject: Article 13 TEU and Employment The draft Commission Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation gives exemption to religious organisations (Art. 4.2).	1.169519866836039
Could the Commission please tell Parliament the circumstances and the groups within Article 13 (TEU) likely to be effected by such an exemption?	1.0247003749230703
A month ago, the Commission submitted a proposal on equal treatment in employment, as prescribed in the Treaty, in order to implement Article 13.	1.476903939421168
The ban on discrimination is the rule in the package of directives and programmes which we submitted.	0.9870124310710485
At the Commission' s proposal and after approximately two years of consultation with social agencies, Member States and the European Parliament, a number of exceptions have been made.	1.1932818978160895
These exceptions relate to professions which must be exercised by persons with a genuine professional qualification.	0.897396770527093
Allow me to give you a specific example to illustrate this.	1.1144207322717852
In a religious school, it is logical for an exemption to be requested and accepted in order to ensure that the teacher is of the faith to which the religious school in question belongs.	1.2811603101457778
That is the sort of exemption we are talking about.	0.8080671365765657
Clearly this is not a general exemption and the different approach which allow Member States to introduce special provisions are only justified in the case of this special professional qualification.	1.2507630753432293
This is a perverse interpretation of ending discrimination.	1.0367134449399815
For instance, religious schools could quite properly say to a Roman Catholic for example: we do not want to employ you because you are a gay man or because you are a lesbian.	1.0940128128488544
Here we have from the Commission a reinforcement of a hierarchy of oppression.	1.1186155685335941
Surely what we should be doing, and I hope you will agree, Commissioner, is engaging the person to do the job on the basis of their capability, and we should not enshrine such bigotry and prejudice, no matter how sincerely held.	1.483651869726844
I must stress that this exemption is not a refusal of work for any reason, be it the reason which you mentioned, sexual orientation, ethnic discrimination or any other reason.	1.1199139289268247
It allows a choice to be made only where special qualifications are needed which relate directly to the activity in question.	1.040097251964848
In other words, it is positive discrimination.	1.2884346787619703
In the example which you mentioned, it is only logical that the teacher in a Catholic school should be Catholic.	1.121683110201073
That is the only form of exemption which is acceptable.	1.1803349877025977
Question No 41 by (H-0813/99):	0.627383995658834
Subject: Promoting jobs for women in severely less-favoured regions Given the enormous difficulties in obtaining work which women face in certain severely less-favoured regions, and given that these women very seldom have any resources to draw on, in terms of either finance, entrepreneurial or cooperative traditions or even training facilities, living as they do in rural districts where 80% of the population is on the poverty line, what measures or actions are planned to help these women overcome the hurdle of their social environment?	1.2009365669882572
Does the Commission intend to put forward lowest common denominator policies which will properly reflect the admittedly extreme but nonetheless real-life situation of these women, or will their plight once again be overlooked by the new employment policies?	1.1474599797444356
Obviously, the cohesion policy exists for less-favoured regions and cooperation and joint action by the Structural Funds, the Social Fund and the Agricultural Fund exist for the cohesion policy.	1.3562028903061116
I should point out that the funds available for regions with problems account for one third of the total budget.	1.1357114464074523
The aim of these regional policies, which, of course, are implemented under the jointly agreed European guidelines in each Member State, i.e. each Member State is responsible for implementing this programme, is to increase opportunities for work for both men and women.	1.2964517349196314
I should point out that 70% of funding for the period 2000-2006, i.e. EUR 195 billion, will go to the less-favoured regions of Europe.	1.07972113791399
With particular reference now to the question of access by women to the opportunities which are created, I would like to say, first, that there is, via the Social Fund, an entire equal opportunities pillar which the Member States must implement, i.e. special policies for women which must use Social Fund resources.	1.3285189947987461
Secondly, the LEADER initiative currently being studied gives special priority to development strategies which aim to give special support to women in small enterprises in the agricultural sector and in rural tourism, with a view to increasing the involvement of women in agricultural regions.	1.2307431500085575
Commissioner, thank you for giving me a well-intentioned answer, which has been rigorous and well-argued.	1.2269096810717872
However, I can assure you that we do not, with the existing measures - which you have referred to - reach these severely less-favoured regions.	1.3775584717650513
They are areas where there is much need and we have to put them on an equal footing with those areas where we work in cooperation, where almost none exists.	1.3769119237255532
Therefore, my question is whether you could examine the possibility that some of the policies on microcredits, which have brought results in cooperation, could be applied to those women in severely less-favoured regions, who have the odds stacked against them.	1.4314499011387993
I am very familiar with the programmes which you refer to.	1.2850273665348
I can assure you that we are not reaching the areas where there is most need.	1.232613030416979
With these forecasts of the structural policy - which I know very well - and the forecasts of LEADER and rural development, we will not promote, as we should, employment amongst women in the severely less-favoured regions.	1.5906189138420936
I would therefore ask you to study the possibility of applying microcredit policies.	0.8947653795875488
Question No 42 by (H-0817/99):	0.6265841841301621
Subject: Commission's plans for presentation of a new social action programme It is important that the Commission present as soon as possible a new social action programme, setting out a specific plan with a timetable for implementation for both the legislative work in the area of social security and initiatives for framework agreements in the context of the 'social dialogue'.	1.2396732044697676
Can the Commission say what its precise intentions are regarding the presentation of a new social action programme?	0.8883126715172587
We estimate that the Commission' s new social action programme for the next five years will be ready at the end of this summer.	1.273277408345874
In order to complete the programme and be able to present it, we first need to complete our consultations with Parliament, the social partners and non-governmental organisations.	1.3809044652461742
These discussions have already started, but we will need to take account of the results in Lisbon.	1.3468247730195508
The Lisbon European Council is trying to take a new approach to the question of social exclusion and the link between social exclusion and the information society, economic policy and reforms.	1.2504114659021364
These results will be most important in shaping the Commission' s social programme.	1.1977442464077914
I have already told the European Parliament that a joint meeting will be held in April between Parliament and the Commission, after the Lisbon conference, so that all aspects can be discussed and the social programme for 2000-2006 can finally be drafted.	1.4576905664900477
Clearly, any future social action programme should take account of developments, for example within information technology, and, in time, become a modern social action programme.	1.4032005331872037
But can you also provide confirmation concerning the matter I raise in my question, namely that the programme will be designed in such a way that we shall obtain a concrete timetable for the various types of legislation in the social sphere which the Commission is planning, as well as for those initiatives which the Commission is planning with regard to dialogue between the two sides of industry?	1.3534396100137636
We need to see which concrete alternatives the Commission will adopt during the coming period and which initiatives it will take for the purpose of reaching agreements.	1.3180149907967291
Firstly, I agree with you entirely. Account will be taken of the information society; that was something which I too mentioned.	1.4618464378333929
Social exclusion, the programme for women, the efforts we are making in the social protection area, everything needs to be looked at now in the light of the new reality of the information society.	1.4346601613267806
Secondly, there will obviously be timetables for the initiatives within which systematic monitoring will also have to be implemented.	1.3787520262233341
Where I cannot commit myself is on your reference to legislative work in the social security area which, as you know, is not included in the articles of the Treaty and there is no legal basis for social security questions in the Treaty.	1.33755018332228
Question No 44 by (H-0819/99):	0.6265841803526024
Subject: Opportunities of the disabled to take advantage of freedom of movement within the EU Under Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty, it should be possible for all EU citizens to take advantage of freedom of movement within the Union.	1.0807103542946594
However, for people with various kinds of physical disability who are in need of special transport and personal assistance, freedom of movement is still highly restricted.	1.3922076806315384
What measures is the Commission taking to facilitate opportunities for the disabled in this area?	1.2010924996777776
On 26 November 1999, the European Commission approved a package of measures to combat discrimination.	1.3627382528780558
As far as the package in question and people with special needs are concerned, there is a directive which concentrates on combating discrimination, especially in the workplace.	1.3076476881562462
The European Commission believes that this initiative to combat discrimination will help to increase the level of employment of people with special needs and, in the end, to promote the freedom of movement of these persons.	1.5420126150920643
Of course, it is particularly important for people with special needs to have access to means of transport, services and all types of installation if they are to exercise their right to freedom of movement.	1.2138898052339198
The European Commission has approved a proposal for a directive on special arrangements in buses, coaches and other vehicles, so that people with special needs with mobility problems and people using wheelchairs have access to them.	1.0776456606121385
In addition, you should know that, on 4 June 1998, the Council approved the recommendation for a pan-European type of parking permit to be introduced for people with special needs, the aim of which is to help them travel in all Member States with a common permit so that they can take advantage of all organised parking areas throughout Europe.	1.4753909671842285
I would thank the Commissioner for her answer.	0.9675652200651835
My question in the first place concerns the opportunities the disabled have to take advantage of freedom of movement in Europe.	1.1101350400039875
It is quite an expensive business if you are to travel from Gothenburg to somewhere else in Europe on holiday or on a study visit if you are in a wheelchair and also need to have a personal assistant or carer with you in order to manage.	1.2358435915058874
I am grateful for the fact that the Commission has adopted an action plan.	1.2435973981928525
It is of course a prerequisite, however, that there be financial resources and means of actually crossing the borders physically if you have a disability.	1.3006694816309123
It would be interesting to hear whether the Commission is also prepared to set aside financial resources for those who have disabilities, so that they too might venture further out into the world than merely to where their wheelchairs take them.	1.3338995582127888
I referred to the directive which the Commission has proposed on compulsory arrangements for means of public transport, so that people with special needs can use them.	1.2778418737435426
It has not yet been passed by the Council; it is at the consultation stage.	1.6547874438114807
I think that a strategic decision of this sort can be taken at European level.	1.4023979471980437
I think it is exceptionally difficult for us to specialise in aid programmes for personal transport.	0.9334501661746166
That is dealt with either under special programmes in education, for young people, for women and for exchanges or must be a matter for national policy.	1.330994428223179
Question No 45 by (H-0006/00):	0.7498385797031025
Subject: Compliance with Directive 96/71/EC concerning the posting of workers The posting of workers directive has still not been implemented in Denmark, even though the deadline has passed.	1.1142934407687044
The draft legislation before the Folketing does not contain any rules governing rights of employed persons under collective agreements.	0.8838945124351085
Pursuant to Article 3(8) of the Directive, terms and conditions of employment must be in keeping with the 'collective agreements which have been concluded by the most representative employers' and labour organisations at national level and which are applied throughout national territory'.	1.1369352766252365
However, such use of an agreement outside its specific scope cannot be imposed on the two sides of industry without a legal basis.	1.3393480741407062
There are therefore two possible solutions: either the Directive is inapplicable in Denmark, or Denmark is required by the Directive to introduce universally applicable agreements.	1.1671238987101336
Can the Commission confirm that the Directive concerning the posting of workers is inapplicable in Denmark as far as 'collective agreements ... declared universally applicable' (cf. Article 3(1)) are concerned, given that such universally applicable agreements do not exist under Danish law?	1.2594855049456375
If not, will it explain how the Directive is to be complied with in this area?	1.5299398814534109
The European Union posting of workers directive stipulates that the compulsory rules concerning the terms and conditions of employment applicable in the host country must also apply to workers posted to that country.	1.1146326391523118
What it says it that one of two things may apply, i.e. either the legislation in the host country or the collective agreements which have been declared to be the rules universally applicable to a specific sector.	1.1952700428517784
Because Denmark does not have a system for declaring collective agreements to be universally applicable rules, provision must be made in the implementing legislation so that, apart from current conditions of employment stipulated in legislation, the hours in universally applicable collective agreements, concluded by the most representative organisations, also apply to posted workers.	1.201529717672409
In other words, to put it simply, Denmark has a choice: it can either introduce legislation or it can use the legislative process to choose a collective agreement and legally activate it.	1.3138293065355202
Discussions are being held between the European Commission and Denmark, and Denmark is expected to notify the Commission of the transposition of this directive into its national legislation.	1.4424493254332433
The deadline by which it had to answer the Commission' s questions expired on 6 December 1999 and we have not received a reply.	1.4004577227274302
We are waiting to see what the next move will be.	1.0243532517429
Thank you for a very clear answer, the gist of which - if the interpretation is correct - is that the posting of workers directive entails an obligation on the part of the Danish state to establish a system of universally applicable agreements.	1.3628282144150268
It is a very clear answer, but it is also an answer, may I point out, which puts Danish organisations, the Danish Government and the Danish Parliament in a very, very difficult situation politically, for it is a well-known fact that there are a number of basic problems associated with the relationship between the Danish model, which is based quite obviously upon collective agreements, and the Continental model, which presupposes legislation.	1.5454357644212764
The disagreement and the correspondence to which you refer, Commissioner, concern, first and foremost, another directive, namely the working time directive, but now we can foresee another letter of formal notice and further Treaty infringement proceedings looming because the Danish Government does not intend, or has expressly stated that it does not wish, to implement legislation and establish universally applicable agreements.	1.2673186123082603
Firstly, no attempt is being made to change the system in Denmark or in any other country.	1.416842260646635
As I said earlier, there are always problems interpreting the directives of the European Commission both because they have a very general framework and because systems are very different from one country to another.	1.3123462134719244
As far as your question is concerned, this problem does not only apply to Denmark. It is not only Denmark which has matters pending.	1.3797031941960372
Five countries have transposed this into national legislation and the rest are at the discussion stage.	1.0761896298232543
What now needs to be done, and this was the reason for the consultations and discussions between the Commission and the Danish Government, and with other governments, is to find the best way forward, so that something which is decided at European level by all the Member States, and which constitutes a general framework, can also include workers posted to Denmark from other countries.	1.5524408101749378
And this is the direction in which we expect the Danish and the other nine governments to move.	1.401660141303359
Thank you very much, Commissioner, for your dedication.	1.0422839045127097
You have fulfilled your objective for today, which is to answer all the questions.	1.3427989055205563
We congratulate you.	0.3465380164332319
Since the time allocated to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions 46 to 68 will be replied to in writing.	0.9528865173858935
That concludes Question Time.	0.17283601513432983
(The sitting was suspended at 7.50 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)	0.4743843368100697
1997 discharge	-0.0
The next item is the report (A5-0004/2000) by Mrs van der Laan, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on giving discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Communities for the 1997 financial year (Section I - Parliament, II - Council, III - Commission, IV - Court of Justice and V - Court of Auditors) [SEC(1998) 520 - C4-0350/1998, SEC(1998) 522 - C4-0351/1998, SEC(1998) 519 - C4-0352/1999]	1.2622601415964552
The Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, is not here yet, but I hope, and expect, that she will arrive in the next few minutes.	1.7461134194361236
Nevertheless, I recommend that we start, in the hope that the Commissioner will be able to follow the debate, and particularly the rapporteur' s speech, from her office, if that is where she still is.	1.568080880290942
Mr President, I am sure that Mrs Schreyer must have a very good reason for not being here because her absence would be inexcusable otherwise.	1.351035804898492
I would like to start by thanking my colleagues for their cooperation on this report, it would not be what it is today without that spirit of cooperation.	1.2737312115232655
Mr President, early last year, the 1997 discharge was postponed because this Parliament could not possibly grant discharge to a resigning Commission which could not enter into any commitments for the future.	1.1761342224311868
In its resolution, this Parliament stated that discharge could not be granted until we had received serious, far-reaching proposals for reform from the new European Commission.	1.2596077894794777
This report, therefore, appears at a crucial time, on the eve of Mr Kinnock' s reforms.	1.278848859705419
It is an excellent opportunity for this Parliament to introduce far-reaching reforms to these plans.	1.284324723074733
In the period leading up to this, it already appeared, on the basis of the initial drafts, that the Commission had made very important pledges.	1.4740988990702129
We asked for a whistle-blower' s regulation, and this is now in place.	1.2865252036962047
Parliament wanted financial inspection and audit functions to be separated.	0.7923037788956943
This has now been done.	0.7618954678847408
Parliament requires a code of conduct for Commissioners and Cabinets.	0.7127252603068898
This is in place too.	1.2264554719646819
Parliament asked the Commission to waive its excessive privileges.	1.041234851713193
It did this as well.	0.6406504883187688
The Commission has also entered into commitments to cooperate with Parliament in terms of SEM 2000.	1.1939676654926408
Fundamental changes will also be considered for the technical assistance offices.	0.9206331002196345
These are sound, first steps which illustrate that, if this Parliament so wishes, changes are not only possible but can also be translated into action quickly.	1.336317965220463
We want more than that, however.	1.2356572112151052
The Commission should now produce an ambitious and far-reaching reform programme.	1.14964160384245
This is not only necessary for proper public administration, it is a conditio sine qua non of regaining the trust of the European citizen.	1.3868488812971689
We now demand from the European Commission clear pledges concerning the following points.	1.183088390243611
Firstly, Parliament must have complete access to all Commission documents.	1.4241662844075265
This, however, presupposes that we set up an internal scheme quickly in order to be able to guarantee the confidentiality of sensitive documents.	1.2550700399878567
In the context of providing information, I would like to draw the Commission' s attention to the fact that we are very concerned about the present draft plans on public access to documents.	1.1733435752336059
If the current draft is correct, then this is a huge step backwards in comparison to today.	1.3648171601528427
We must put an end to the situation in which financially powerful organisations with representation in Brussels are able to access information whilst the ordinary citizen is not.	1.0850539169376356
Neither can we tolerate a situation in which a public body holds the copyright to public documents.	1.0673328139132576
We would also like a clear job description for each European official so that an official with conscientious objections can more easily object to tasks which are unethical or unlawful.	1.0505273442630332
Furthermore, it should be the case that, if the Court of Auditors detects a mistake not just one year but two years running, the management should be held responsible for it, and this will have an effect on chances of promotion.	1.4644288814490993
Ultimately, we also need to achieve better cooperation, of course, between the European Court of Auditors and its national counterparts.	1.546992282118404
This Parliament has also asked the Commission to give an initial outline of the external aid policy reforms on 31 March of this year.	1.233081656643163
It should no longer be the case that, although Europe is an economic power, we have no political influence because, when the chips are down, we cannot offer effective aid to areas which desperately need it.	1.5614768173465232
I would quote Gaza as an example.	0.7951085702780264
It is unacceptable that the Commission completed the construction of a hospital in 1996 and that, as yet, it has been left unused.	1.4777087343417175
Mr President, since 1996, the discharge has acquired a heavy, political significance.	1.4826509763833051
It is one of the most powerful weapons Parliament has and must therefore be deployed with care.	1.083862003412214
This is why we will most probably grant the discharge tomorrow.	1.1332017921235173
However, we are not surrendering this weapon without placing a time bomb in its place.	1.2073839342772634
Indeed, the 1999 discharge will not be given until all financial irregularities highlighted by the Court of Auditors have been cleared up.	1.2671670998240354
Finally, this discharge report is naturally addressed to the Commission. But this does not detract from the fact that the European Parliament should also put its own house in order.	1.447174987320263
As long as we have no status, we are not credible as a force for reforming the Union. The reforms of the European institutions are necessary in order to be able to continue Europe' s development process.	1.6104902977801776
We cannot have a decisive and fair Europe unless it is also open and democratic.	1.1374337095624045
All institutions must now join forces in order to work together towards building this type of Europe.	1.106064143857742
Mr President, the Committee on Industry decided to go ahead and draw up a report on the discharge for 1997 although we were not specifically asked to do so.	1.290234146902864
We went ahead because we felt we should start this Parliament in the way in which we mean to go on, that is, by making sure that we take good care of taxpayers' money in Europe.	1.3375174737957491
During the course of our work on this report it became clear that there are persistent problems in the spending areas under the control of our budget.	1.3307405755805115
They were not unique to 1997 and two strands seem to run through them.	0.8882735866025577
The first is a tendency for the Commission to embark on very ambitious programmes, particularly in third countries, without sufficient assessment of the practicalities of implementation and proper resourcing.	1.3241808356006333
The second involves serious managerial shortcomings in the Commission, in particular in relation to coordination across departments and management of external contracts.	1.1814501439234608
I know that all the Institutions bear some responsibility for the increasing workload of the Commission and for some of the lack of resources.	1.3897255548497787
That cannot excuse everything that we came across.	0.7321492985674866
Citizens of Europe expect the European institutions to be properly managed and they are right to do so.	1.3305847684854177
That is why I want to echo the comments from my colleague about the importance of the reform process which has been promised to the people of Europe by Mr Prodi and Mr Kinnock.	1.4466641165158591
From what I have seen of the reform process, it looks good.	1.5036588883069941
I saw some of Mr Kinnock's papers today, I heard some of what he had to say.	1.3093881371820824
I have every confidence that if we and the politicians of Europe support him we will see the kind of reform we need.	1.0789950616355715
But we need that reform process.	1.108721961280122
Many of the general points raised in our committee's report have been covered in Mrs van der Laan's report.	1.0880203153448602
It is an excellent report and we should all congratulate her on it.	1.352792765155154
It seems to hit on all the right points without just being like some of the old reports, a series of details.	1.1846364268520921
It groups them together and that is very important.	1.2001370803805202
There are two issues I would like to draw your attention to.	1.0148644723195939
One is nuclear safety in Eastern Europe.	0.7133462624196848
We have to get this right.	1.127296928205139
The Committee of Independent Experts said the Commission was not managing this properly.	1.0562796346110521
We have to remedy that.	1.1132066543463452
The second point is about scrutiny mechanisms.	0.8938402327374052
We need from the Commission material we can use to help us scrutinise spending.	1.1304643680613546
We need proper information, given in a proper way and we all have to take this whole process a lot more seriously than in the past.	1.4071268516157436
It has been seen as a bureaucratic process to be done as quickly as possible in as little time as possible.	1.3488085706463924
I hope colleagues in this House will support the grounds for discharge for 1997 and, at the same time, that the Commission will push ahead with the reform process which is long overdue.	1.3047182004996063
Only in this way can we create a new culture in the Commission and at the same time get public confidence restored.	1.514873033140141
Mr President, I am sure the Commission will be relieved to hear that the 97 discharge is unlikely to have the same impact as the 96 discharge which, as you are all so very well aware, led to the forced resignation of the Santer Commission.	1.3224159759798413
The Socialist Group will be voting to grant discharge.	0.9467346744598913
I am sure you will be relieved to hear that as well.	1.0177957846255348
But that is not to say that we are satisfied, and that everything in the garden is rosy.	1.4939691621291018
It is clear that a radical overhaul of the Commission is long overdue.	1.49007002139437
It indicates, however, that we acknowledge that steps are being made in the right direction.	1.1554578499995598
I just want to outline some of the issues that we, as Socialists, have put down as amendments.	1.3314573494461035
We hope these will be carried because they are important in the way that they will impact on future reform.	1.3774429914816968
First of all, the immunity of officials: this should be lifted if and when requested by a national prosecutor.	1.161341823576329
We need to make it much easier to prosecute officials who are guilty of fraud and corruption.	1.0494944530387174
It is critical to note that the Commission has too often failed to act on the reforms recommended by the Court of Auditors.	1.1492298888656365
The Court's report is there for a reason, our response to it is there for a reason and it is important that it is followed through.	1.410213065056684
I have just heard now that an audit progress board is going to be set up by the Commission.	1.1956079069486765
Even if we hear nothing else, we know that is going in the right direction in terms of the reforms that we want to see.	1.5116926537767044
Too often we have put forward recommendations and they have not been acted upon even though you have said very often that you will act on them.	1.2514570228411033
We want to see that follow-through to a much greater extent in future.	1.3044161381460053
The other issue is access to confidential documents.	0.6755885992581645
We have had problems in the past in terms of our responsibility in carrying out discharge because we have not had access to the documents we should have had.	1.5716678654881133
We understand that we also have a responsibility here, that if we are given documents we must ensure that confidential documents will indeed be kept confidential.	1.4110252956270364
We have put down an amendment to that effect.	1.067653059760931
One issue which is referred to in the van der Laan report is the whole question of the Gaza hospital.	1.2888569423365444
The situation there is totally unacceptable.	0.6740021801646361
We will not put up with it for much longer and we are looking for immediate action on that issue.	1.2376616163944199
I would like to congratulate Lousewies van der Laan.	1.1986569472911808
I do not usually bother congratulating people but I think she has produced a very cogent report and deserves our thanks.	1.1880905670451036
Mr President, Commissioner, if we are honest, we find ourselves in a somewhat unusual situation.	1.3153647489084637
We are discussing last year' s discharge, but also the Commission' s responsibility.	1.4443553667970537
I would like to raise the problems which are still piled up high on our desks.	1.2384810634577803
The assessment of whether or not the discharge will be granted also depends to some extent on where the emphasis is placed.	1.0933026579077592
It is about a Commission which is no more.	1.3350078623409962
There is now a new Commission.	0.8790268548317802
Then it is logical to grant discharge, because how can the current Commissioner be blamed where 1997 is concerned?	1.2528961473189055
The problems remain and this gives rise to doubts.	0.6602134394331601
We have to take a decision now regarding the Commission' s good intentions, but there is still no structural outline for these good intentions.	1.3671147401947412
Mr Kinnock will present his proposal next month.	0.7375486015144009
We are all very much anticipating this, but the facts are still missing at this time when we already have to decide whether or not to grant discharge.	1.4499261822892278
It is clearly a dilemma with which the rapporteur has also struggled.	1.3568261450742856
This dilemma stretches beyond the areas which I have already listed.	1.1890248441105553
Take, for example, the pledges made by the Commission. They look good in themselves.	1.3385534618762074
I have read a few documents written by Mr Kinnock and we have every confidence in them.	1.175653815932871
But I will give two examples from which it is not as evident that the good intentions which the Commission has now expressed will lead to a good outcome: the public nature and confidentiality of documents.	1.4976166346949922
The previous speaker already said something about this.	0.9246914110095168
A document is circulating at the moment - not at a low level, but at a high level within the Commission - which, instead of enhancing the public nature of documents, is having the opposite effect.	1.4355472157817881
This is an illustration of empty pledges not necessarily leading to good results.	1.032050893146029
This also applies to whistle-blowers.	0.6159249737527729
Mr Kinnock has also devoted some fine-sounding phrases to this subject but, at the same time, it is entirely unclear, at this moment when we have to make a decision, what, for example, happens with whistle-blowers who want to get something off their chest and cannot do this internally but who want to address the outside world - the press or Parliament.	1.348722421212243
We have still not had a response to crucial questions of this type.	0.8553034718030348
So there is doubt as to whether these pledges of the Commission contain enough substance at this crucial time when decisions need to be made.	1.2616622479312143
This also applies, for example, to the very real projects which the Committee on Industry has introduced.	1.5192054883755552
In my opinion, the Commission and Mr Kinnock should come with good intentions and with sound plans on personnel policy and financial management, but each Commissioner who is now responsible for an area which has had serious shortcomings in the past should come with sound plans in order to improve the situation and not with general, empty proposals.	1.3774297698327616
At the moment, our group still feels sympathy for, and patience with, the Commission because it cannot be held responsible for a large proportion of the mistakes made in the past, but this patience has a limit.	1.4863844600077905
Clear progress must be visible.	0.4128254758906471
At present, we trust that the Commission will produce these sound proposals, but it is not a foregone conclusion that it will do so.	1.5168178028755919
Finally, Mr President, the 1996 discharge was the beginning of the end of the last Commission.	1.4372275847479732
I express the hope that - in fact, I urge the present Commission to ensure that - the 1997 discharge is the beginning of a true reform of financial policy by the Commission. Otherwise this discharge will not have been of any value.	1.5964412349024868
In assessing the question of whether or not to grant the Commission discharge, the decision must be based upon what actually occurred during the financial year concerned, in this case in the course of 1997.	1.476336395099822
In our Group, we find it hard to see how the financial administration for 1997 was in any crucial way better than that for 1996.	1.2422043646882568
In that year, we voted against granting discharge.	1.294227709865065
As a result, we shall vote against granting discharge for 1997, too.	1.1466490988994078
We think that this picture of ours is confirmed by the examination carried out by the Court of Auditors.	1.0969697952987683
It is both good and necessary that reforms have been promised.	0.8494386280526803
So far, the promises which have been made are still, however, to be fulfilled, especially where transparency is concerned.	1.5207652275163386
We are therefore going to vote in favour of the demands for reforms which are presented in the resolution, but against the granting of discharge.	1.3293966017902314
Mr President, first of all, I have only positive comments to make on Mrs Van der Laan' s very expert work on this report.	1.2486967383622216
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group cannot vote for approving the accounts for 1997.	0.7912518676720003
The report on so-called discharge contains a comprehensive and extremely critical survey of the accounts.	1.0366453205800839
We support these critical remarks, and I must therefore state that it would seem quite absurd, against this background, to vote in favour of approving the accounts.	1.2583028811409618
It has not been possible for the Court of Auditors to issue an auditor' s statement to the effect that the arrangements covered by the accounts are lawful, and we should regard it as extremely problematic if we, as Members of this Parliament, were to vote in favour of accounts without having any guarantee of the legality of the arrangements concerned.	1.257650197156628
The majority have made their approval of the accounts conditional upon the new Commission' s implementing a series of reforms, so as to ensure that what we are familiar with from the previous Commission' s period of office is not repeated.	1.2353803018148435
Again, I must say that we are concerned here with an extremely unfortunate confusion of the old Commission' s accountability for 1997 and the new Commission' s accountability for the future.	1.4273060777905564
We do not think that the new Commission, under any circumstances, could incur liability for the past.	1.6181290933908827
We think it is wrong to talk about the Commission' s liability as an institution.	1.3780863940283579
The mistakes up until 1999 are attributable to those who had responsibility at that time, and we still have no way of knowing whether the new Commission can do any better.	1.2716687864128093
By means of this extraordinary procedure, Parliament is stopping itself from placing liability for the arrangements in 1997 squarely where it belongs, namely with the previous Commission.	1.1968212715569215
It was the 1996 accounts which led to the downfall of the previous Commission, and the 1997 accounts are just as incriminating.	1.4170643297503087
There is no reason why, against this background, we should agree to grant discharge.	1.2757821751390905
As far as the decision to balance the accounts is concerned, we shall abstain from voting, and where, finally, the motion for a resolution is concerned, we shall attach most importance to the many correct instructions contained in this and vote in favour of it.	1.4133811074950686
Mr President, the decision relating to discharge for the 1997 financial year was postponed because the erstwhile Commission, to whom it was to be granted, had stepped down before the appointed time and was only continuing in office in a caretaker capacity.	1.2611719707639235
Mrs van der Laan' s report - on which she has lavished a great deal of hard work, and for which we are indebted to her - proposes that we should grant discharge to the Commission for 1997.	1.4462686908379327
One might ask how it is that the current Commission is to receive the discharge for its predecessor' s budgetary management - Mr Camre just mentioned this - particularly as the discharge for the previous year, 1996, was denied.	1.3971316590710037
That is just the way things are, however.	1.2079602748338603
In taking over the mandate, the new Commission has to assume responsibility not just for the achievements of the past but also for the mistakes made.	1.4022057078016414
Since, on account of the college system, discharge can only be granted to the Commission as a whole or, alternatively, denied or postponed, it is no longer of any consequence that four former Commissioners who belonged to the previous Commission that has yet to be discharged, crop up again as Members of this body.	1.2469147951577684
This question ought to have been asked when the new Commission was appointed.	1.1683566611657128
If Parliament votes in favour of the Committee on Budgetary Control' s proposal this week and grants discharge, then the Commission must not take this to be a blank cheque.	1.5732059807007193
For it is the third section of Mrs van der Laan' s report that is the most important, to my mind, namely the motion for a resolution.	1.4156241899224091
The comments contained within, under eight headings, are an integral part of the discharge, the implementation of which forms the basis of our decision.	1.3805936510476304
In the course of the discharge procedure for the coming years - that for 1998 is already under way - Parliament will have to examine, as a matter of urgency, whether or not it was too quick to bestow premature praise on the Commission for 1997.	1.3888120201962626
We will be in a position to judge just as soon as the Commission presents its reform programme.	1.3016282412465086
We will be able to use the discharge procedure for 1998 to check whether efficiency, transparency and accountability, and likewise a sincere willingness to provide information, are being displayed vis-à-vis the discharge authority.	1.1948693041478302
Mr President, we all recall that Parliament decided to postpone the discharge for the 1997 financial year pending commitments from the new European Commission regarding internal reform.	1.1514314836974633
In response to this the Commission has entered into various commitments and has certainly adopted many reform measures.	1.2292515942741709
It is fair to say that the new President, Mr Prodi, and his team are certainly committed to implementing the financial control requirements as laid down by this Parliament.	1.4086569697062197
However, the reform of the European Commission must now be taken in the context of the debate that is going to take place in the run-up to the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and the reform of various EU policies and initiatives.	1.494346261065635
Existing EU treaties will be amended so as to ensure, for example, that the enlargement process can succeed.	1.2919253209785104
I have no doubt further reform of EU institutions will be analysed in this debate.	1.0562299643466841
But from the perspective of small Member States it is important that, as the European Commission is reformed, it must be done in a way that ensures that small Member States continue to have representation on the Commission.	1.3906778703676321
Mr President, the Commission is now to obtain its discharge for 1997, but in reality it does not deserve it.	1.4134004549122647
1997 was a matter for the old Commission and, therefore, the new Commission does not think that it can accept liability.	1.594562245077373
It is true that implementation of the Budget for 1997 fell within the old Commission' s remit. The new Commission has, on the other hand, undertaken to carry out a cleaning up exercise following former scandals, and I must admit that I am not impressed at all.	1.3979366844032735
The old mindset which involved sweeping things under the carpet and protecting one' s friends unfortunately still exists.	0.8199159534516157
There are some who think that it is more in our interests to let bygones be bygones and make a fresh start. I do not, however, think we can make a fresh start if we do not tidy things up properly.	1.351549254322857
I am referring here especially to the earlier scandals involving ECHO.	0.9874983477493723
I am very indignant about the fact that it is so difficult to get any documents handed over on this matter.	1.1242823581245724
I am the rapporteur for ECHO on the Committee on Budgetary Control, and I shall have a lot of difficulty carrying out my work if the Commission will not give me the necessary information.	1.4155432249450866
From the outside, it looks as if the Commission has something to hide.	1.4077777132814555
My investigations also unfortunately suggest that this could be the case.	0.8265223681929136
The Commission is not putting all its cards on the table and is in that way repeating ancient practice on the part of the Commission.	1.1518286322239668
It was this practice which led to the Commission' s downfall.	1.2389252872501528
I can therefore fully support the demand to give Parliament unconditional right of access to documents. Otherwise, we cannot carry out our work.	1.1690853935783134
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.	0.888918349451551
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	0.1800861409464389
Response to Second Report of Committee of Independent Experts	0.879506399386399
The next item is the report (A5-0001/2000) by Mr van Hulten, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on action to be taken on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on reform of the Commission.	1.0917105106021983
Mr President, this time last year the European Parliament set up a committee of independent experts chaired by Mr Middelhoek to investigate allegations of fraud, nepotism and corruption in the European Commission.	1.410456416240537
On 15 March the committee published its first report concluding that: "It is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of responsibility".	1.1105053427504574
Within a few hours of the presentation of the report President Santer announced the resignation of his entire team.	1.057840226740968
The resignation marked the end of a bitter struggle between an increasingly confident Parliament and a European Commission mired in allegations of scandal.	1.0934501386944357
Since then the Brussels landscape has changed beyond recognition; a new, reinvigorated Parliament has been elected and a new Commission confirmed in office.	1.1425557422634152
Speaking in this House on 21 July President-designate Prodi undertook to take full account of the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on Commission reform, which contains 90 detailed recommendations and which we are debating today.	1.2146230035608374
The new Commission has already taken important steps to move away from the way it used to function.	1.1763916687359084
A code of conduct for Commissioners and their private offices has been adopted.	0.7667150629832614
In a symbolic but significant gesture Commissioners have voluntarily renounced their entitlement to the tax-free purchase of alcohol, tobacco, petrol and consumer goods.	0.8831393939021646
New rules have been drawn up and implemented governing the appointment of senior officials.	0.9125864248476814
The number of departments has been reduced.	0.7856368199141396
The Commission, in my opinion, has shown a clear and unprecedented commitment to change and for this they are to be congratulated.	1.288504419613769
The overall aim of the reforms must be to create a strong, honest European public administration equipped to carry out its tasks in an effective and efficient manner; an administration in which officials are provided with the means to carry out their tasks and are held fully accountable at all levels; an administration that recognises and rewards merit and encourages officials to develop their full potential.	1.210041017216198
In order to achieve this, action is required in four areas.	1.1939552125085842
First, financial management and control within the Commission must be improved.	1.347125010157615
One of the main problems is the lack of a functioning system of financial control.	1.1229909968487612
The Commission's DGs must be made fully responsible for their own expenditure, including financial control.	1.4100117844768403
A new independent audit system service must be set up.	0.8327666659486692
DGs must publish their own annual accounts so as to enable a clear identification of problem areas and set annual targets for reducing fraud and irregularities.	0.9874393785548862
In return for this greater degree of autonomy, managers must be made fully and personally responsible for their actions.	0.9781915636405742
It is clear that the transition to such a new system will take time.	1.1330522428666838
Changes to the Financial Regulation will be required and Parliament must have its say on those changes.	1.2154389238293377
But while the Commission must ensure that it respects the Treaty and the Financial Regulation in the transitional phase, this must not be an excuse for inertia.	1.7202193303743996
Urgent change is required today.	0.6229020619895232
Second, the fight against fraud, mismanagement and nepotism must be strengthened, firstly by creating a culture in which they cannot thrive.	1.2144275428864724
This requires a clear example to be set by Commissioners and senior staff as well as adequate training and secondly, by reinforcing the existing mechanisms for dealing with fraud.	1.2583394940519068
OLAF, the Commission agency set up earlier this year must be placed under the direction of an independent European public prosecutor whose job will be to prepare for prosecution by national criminal courts, criminal offences committed against the financial interests of the Union by Members and officials of the European institutions.	1.361867614549491
A proposal can be made, a proposal should be made, on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty, by the middle of this year.	1.370658948715868
Third, standards in European public life must be upheld.	0.9781471239218119
The political crisis which led to the downfall of the Commission earlier this year clearly demonstrated the need for unambiguous and enforceable rules of conduct.	1.1330201357301664
A number of codes have since been introduced.	0.7977495895622594
They must be assessed by Parliament and should be made legally binding.	1.07685776281366
The European institutions should follow the example of a number of countries, most notably the United Kingdom, and institute a committee for standards in public life, with a mandate to give advice on professional ethics and rules of conduct in the European institutions.	1.3628834176581939
Whistle-blowers who act in good faith must be protected.	0.8164639058874575
At the end of last year Mr Kinnock announced new measures for the protection of whistle-blowers.	0.8933460943254984
They must be implemented without delay.	0.702517895973881
Although such measures can never be an alternative for good management, they must be an escape valve when something goes wrong.	1.1951440851192678
Crucially, reforms must not be limited to the Commission.	1.0132835263662903
Parliament must consider itself the need for improvements to its internal rules, administrative procedures and management practices.	0.9371612717515907
Finally, the Commission's human resource policy must be modernised.	1.6251858440970937
It is clearly no longer suited to the requirements of a modern, multinational organisation.	1.0723782626500298
The social dialogue has often acted as a brake on reform and its overhaul is long overdue.	0.7934397870194281
A career with the European institutions must become more attractive.	1.3914766919502137
Too many young, new officials are leaving their jobs after just a few years.	1.0868179379259546
Merit must be recognised and rewarded, specific skills training should be a sine qua non for promotion to a higher grade.	1.113291338331481
The promotions procedure must be made fairer and more transparent.	0.80621306145664
Last but not least the pay and benefits package must be reviewed.	0.8115801503127297
It must become more flexible and more responsible to labour market conditions.	0.881296224671734
It must be rid of some of its more outdated elements; and it must deal with the legitimate concerns of the general public who cannot understand why European civil servants should be paid an expatriation allowance indefinitely in a Europe of open borders, or pay a level of taxes that is often well below that of Member States.	1.3002410113379954
Commissioner Kinnock will, tomorrow, present his communication on reform.	0.9131599230145248
This communication must contain a clear timetable.	0.6898064976590654
With a new Commission and a new Parliament up and running the momentum for reform is now as strong as it ever has been and probably ever will be.	1.075881004835004
Enlargement of the Union is just a few years away.	1.5149742575592313
Now is the time for Europe to put its own house in order; to instil in its institutions - as the independent experts might have said - a sense of responsibility.	1.3120405399153956
In June of last year Europe's voters gave a clear signal that they are fed up with endless stories about mismanagement and nepotism.	0.8947952739572272
There is a very simple way to deal with those stories.	1.279918923245588
Let us get rid of mismanagement and nepotism.	0.7499802770045254
Mr President, I do not want to be misunderstood - I sincerely hope this does not happen - and I should therefore like to start by saying that I am, of course, in favour of combating fraud and firmly support the appropriate, necessary reforms.	1.4352353548001964
This is not a straightforward issue and calls for a much more wide-ranging analysis, but I shall restrict myself to raising only a few points, in order to make people more aware, if possible, of what we are talking about.	1.4580276179218716
All the experts can provide information and news, formulate opinions and give advice, but, they have no political or elective responsibility, and rightly so.	1.1775293234180635
I nevertheless believe that politicians should look into what can be gleaned from an expert report and what cannot be taken en masse in a spirit which, on some occasions, I have felt in the past and still feel to be self-destructive.	1.3698784955760561
I believe - and I shall only pick up on a few ideas - that Parliament alone, and no one else, can exert an influence over its Members. If this were not the case, the European Parliament' s authority and representativeness would be seriously undermined in the coming years, and this institution would not move forward, as it should.	1.5259329691593426
It is just as important for no-one to be able to or have to refuse the European Parliament or its committees any documentation.	1.3302547895221548
Members of Parliament must possess the qualities of morality, discipline and discretion over delegated issues innately, and these certainly cannot be imposed on them by anyone else.	1.0602167893333472
I would point out that there is no European legal system, but that a different legal system exists in each Member State.	1.3927474248041805
We run the risk of delegating issues relating to the same offences which will then be punished in different ways.	0.9731379897544776
I agree that an investigation system should be introduced, but I am also absolutely convinced that we must recognise the right to equal respect for dignity and, in any case, the equal need for the right to a defence.	1.5367824042571725
I am opposed to European Community officials being accused of criminal acts at the drop of a hat: whistle-blowing is a method that has no place in the third millennium.	0.9388461026220083
In conclusion, Mr President, Parliament must introduce a principle of democracy: we must implement reforms which allow Parliament to grow and expand its powers, not go into reverse.	1.4673663470148544
This debate on the van Hulten report brings to a close one of the most traumatic periods for the European institutions since their creation in 1957.	1.3932748664480326
The refusal of the European Parliament to grant discharge and the definitive refusal for the 1996 budget; the motion of censure tabled in this House a year ago for differing reasons; and the first report of the Committee of Independent Experts on the reform of the Commission which led to the mass resignation of the Commission itself, are now part of European folklore.	1.5433044148759338
Those of us involved in these historic events are well aware that none of the upheaval would have been caused had we not acted with parliamentary power to press for changes in the way in which the Commission operated.	1.1573452205543144
Remember that the Council of Ministers, absent again this evening from our debate, approved the 1997 discharge - not the 1996 - on the very day the Commission itself resigned on 15 March.	1.4298125601101215
Now we come to the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts which we already had the opportunity to welcome and briefly debate last September.	1.0605182491792402
Our greatest concern in the EPP is to ensure that public confidence in the European Commission is restored.	1.3514464988621222
Further steps to build a strong Europe will be to no avail if the European peoples perceive that there is no adequate system of democratic accountability for over-zealous officials.	1.2507122465928622
Under no circumstances will we concede ground which we have won over the past few months, which we believe to be in the interests of openness and transparency.	1.2055139050567016
We are therefore concerned to see the flurry of Commission announcements in recent weeks by Commissioner Kinnock suggesting policy proposals of various kinds to be put in a White Paper shortly.	1.140264529736549
While conveying a desire to proceed rapidly, it also gives the impression that the Commission is in transmission rather than listening mode.	1.2754495797814303
Our concern is strengthened if the rumour reported a few days ago is true - namely that the Commission wants to limit severely the access of Parliament to information.	1.2231787612204152
This was, after all, one of the causes of the downfall of the last Commission.	0.997377335863774
Have the lessons not been learnt?	0.6906202975715968
The knowledge that the framework relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission still remain to be negotiated led to our disagreement with the rapporteur when we debated his report in committee.	1.4233731885251073
We could, in no way, agree with his view that it would be demeaning for Parliament to set out detailed instructions as to what we wanted the Commission to take up in its reform package.	1.3496707265159755
The less precise, Mr van Hulten, we are in our resolutions, the more room it gives the Commission and your former colleagues in the Council to do what they like.	1.6677377026066895
We believe the vast number of recommendations of the Wise Men' s report should be implemented.	1.0834300966417436
We have, as the EPP-ED group, submitted all the recommendations of the Wise Men' s report in committee and many of them have now been put into the report, entirely changing the nature of the van Hulten report in committee.	1.2146403736735467
We have resubmitted a few amendments which fell in committee, in particular, our desire to see the codes of conduct revised specifically to include the reference to merit and managerial capacity which you, Commissioner, accepted - when we had our hearings last September - should be included in these codes of conduct, particularly when considering appointments and promotion.	1.3403003721384237
Looking to the future, we know that we are at the beginning of a long process of continuing reform in the European Commission.	1.6179426484065602
We want in particular to see the hard-working and highly competent norm for Commission officials acknowledged in the outside world - a reputation that has been darkened by the inappropriate conduct of a few individuals.	1.1986840802255774
Commissioner, you will be aware from your presence in the last Commission why the crisis occurred.	1.450178764566486
In a nutshell: there were programmes being run for which there were insufficient staff resources available.	1.1267602938188284
We urge you to take the opportunity to establish the real staffing needs of the Commission based on the essential activities for which it is responsible.	1.4732112394826804
Our position was made very clear on this topic in the 2000 budget.	0.9019304287036889
We will be vigilant over the next five years to ensure the reforms now being suggested are fully implemented and will support efforts made to modernise institutions.	1.2243584952719353
But, equally, we will not hesitate to withdraw our support financially or otherwise should steps be taken which do not correspond to the openness promised by Commission President Romano Prodi prior to his nomination.	1.0689122086558787
Let us hope that we can avoid institutional upheavals by having an ongoing dialogue which assumes from the outset that Parliament will be an equal partner in deciding the outcome of Commission reform.	1.2216871108784246
Mr President, I must start by apologising that I cannot be nearly as dramatic as Mr Elles in my presentation.	1.2226144085870012
Can I first thank Mr van Hulten for this report.	0.9204060856267763
It is an excellent report.	0.8185262062319903
It would have been wrong for Parliament to have put in willy nilly every single recommendation that came from an external body because Parliament should have its own opinion on these issues.	1.0355224225588284
It is right for us to have a focused report which is what Mr van Hulten has produced.	1.294677924013656
Can I invite Mr Elles not to put the cart before the horse.	0.8237125282516992
Yes, a lot of things were lost by the Socialists but they have not been won in plenary yet, and may I warn him that may not be the case tomorrow.	1.3353477319088864
I should like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for all his efforts so far.	1.1575010250794244
He has been clear that his commitment has been to produce a radical change.	1.172060977163911
Central to this is the attempt to produce and engender responsibility.	1.1382087425522909
It is clear that this needs to be developed at all levels and it needs to recognise the needs of each level within the Commission.	1.17741311779459
It is clear that we need to see a change in the Financial Regulation.	1.277680582865897
That is important.	0.3906482444523105
We need to stop people passing the buck from one to another.	0.9908499042929608
Where failure is occurring within the Commission we need to hold people responsible.	1.2038793668780545
We need to be assured that consistent under-performance must lead to dismissal.	0.9625927596960486
This is natural elsewhere but it seems to be an extremely radical suggestion when it is put to the Commission.	1.2557121685581027
We cannot continue with a situation where incompetence, mismanagement and fraud are costing the European taxpayers money and providing them with a poor service.	1.0120754607442513
I will give you one example of this.	0.7709035298584325
In the 1998 Court of Auditors report an exchange rate miscalculation in relation to Italian wine cost the taxpayers of Europe GBP 8 to 10 million.	0.9922801211697124
It is clear that is not acceptable.	1.5675806760833702
What happened to the person who was responsible for that miscalculation?	0.9538142714734467
We need a system which provides incentives and promotion and we need to see this promotion based on merit.	1.3414709411086922
We recognise that most of the officials within the Commission are extremely hard-working.	1.2505023384893985
But we also recognise that some of the practices are outdated.	1.0075001530739127
We look forward to reading the full Commission proposal on reform and we look forward to working out the detail alongside the Commission because, unlike what Mr Elles has just said, the Commissioner has made a commitment to discuss it with Parliament between now and 1 March.	1.239527422558484
We also need to recognise that people who live in glasshouses should not throw stones.	1.0299076995119805
The European Parliament has not exactly been clean in its approach to things throughout its history.	1.1907276841883867
We have a long way to go before we are perfect ourselves.	1.3174128931566182
Our own staff policy is outdated.	0.6195941945342813
Some of our working practices need radical reform.	0.8833938534045691
I hope that the European Parliament will be hanging onto the coattails of the Commission in this reform process.	1.402999626288091
We recognise the proposals on activity-based budgeting.	0.9747456179731188
We recognise that means discipline on the part of Commission officials and we recognise also that we have a responsibility within Parliament on discipline when we talk about negative priorities.	1.3498066958096262
Finally, can I say that the Commission needs to work on its relationships with the public.	1.6013499064729975
European taxpayers need to be re-assured.	0.876746532260324
The fate of the Commission, of the whole European Union, rests on delivery of this reform.	1.3627916865587013
That is the key issue, delivery of these proposals.	1.3620767439978332
Mr President, I would like to start by extending my compliments to the rapporteur, Mr van Hulten, on his first report.	1.1424286531309897
I very much admire him for keeping his spirits up at a time when he was inundated with so many amendments.	1.0499068370430107
I think that the report drawn up by the Wise Men has been useful and I think that it is also useful for this Parliament - as already stated by Mrs Morgan - that we ourselves should ask for expertise from outside for once to see how our administration is run.	1.4793021048918233
We have submitted an amendment to this effect.	0.9521323098154182
From the many points made by Mr van Hulten in his report, I would like to highlight a few, not necessarily in order of importance but just randomly.	1.2834170967314
Firstly, I think that the Commission should pay much more attention to the proper storage of documents.	1.4657368088320615
The Commission' s records leave a great deal to be desired.	0.9887291258525389
We noticed this when we had to investigate the Flechard affair, which, as it happens, has still not been sorted out.	1.2660491993085123
Curiously, very important documents had gone missing from the cabinets, even from those of the President and of various Directorates-General, and this is clearly something which should not happen.	1.4461757061511142
If Parliament want to carry out proper inspections, these documents must be available, and I would like to know what the Commission intends to do to improve this situation.	1.297924242772974
I would also like to say a few words about ex post financial control.	0.8649422720068657
This has also been partly dealt with in the van Hulten report. I think it would be useful if we were to give report figures per category and per sector on how the budget is implemented.	1.2982436107606836
The general impression at present is that anything budget-related within Europe is bad.	0.9360413798556824
It is clear that, over the past couple of years, we have noticed an upward trend in agriculture and a downward one in structural expenditure.	1.1292976637498031
Is this possible?	0.3456875339343949
I would like to suggest to the Commission that it prescribe a deadline by which the reforms have to be carried out.	1.175365155048206
If we admit new Member States then we need to put our own House in order first.	0.9002026583682827
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr van Hulten.	1.0581825025672995
It is his first report here in plenary.	0.7549480377828925
This is worth a compliment although I regret, of course, that he did not expound it in his own mother tongue.	1.199105746337542
It is a report which came about with difficulty and may well be too late.	1.0862596543306862
In my opinion, this is mainly down to the wrangling between the two major groups within our Committee on Budgetary Control.	1.2407114162075714
Let us be honest.	0.671196918478089
The second report of the Wise Men arrived in September.	0.6568739758646708
We are now four months down the line.	0.9570979665815814
Meanwhile, Mr van Hulten has been inundated with amendments, more than 100 amendments in the first round.	1.4663985920024223
He went back to work, rewrote his report and took into account the very many suggestions, but had to face nearly another 100 amendments in the second round.	1.255193034834624
My fear is that all of this has contributed to a report which is too detailed, too extensive and too late.	1.4248222420398153
Moreover, I have been informed that the Commission has approved a report - today of all days - on the reform of the Commission which will be distributed for further consultation to the various institutions and also to our Parliament, I hope.	1.6319602298678304
Might Mr Kinnock be able to throw some light on the matter this evening?	1.0588014480586574
Mr van Hulten, my Group of the Greens and regionalists will support the attempts in tomorrow afternoon' s plenary meeting to embellish this report.	1.1936270475135962
After all, it makes no sense to copy the many sound recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men word for word in your report.	1.1831057154930769
So tomorrow, if we vote against some amendments or against specific paragraphs, this is certainly not on account of their content but rather to render your report as a whole more readable.	1.3478703397463856
In any case, it should be clear that my group, of course, fully backs the recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men.	1.2485433821769434
In any event, I look forward to the document which was approved by the Commission today.	1.2999906739019682
I also look forward to the White Paper which will be available in February.	1.280040564928146
I have to inform you, Commissioner, that both the report of the Wise Men and that of Mr van Hulten will become gauges for our group, gauges which should make it clear to us whether we can have confidence in the Prodi Commission or not.	1.3692161052033227
I would like to end on the following point. Just as the White Paper on food safety was approved last week and released to public opinion with a clear deadline stated, we would request the same in connection with the new White Paper on the reform of the Commission.	1.3842943643609062
I think that there is a need for this, as public opinion is looking for change and, in any event, my group would like to see a clear change by the end of 2002.	1.4505325970642367
Mr President, this report is positive but, actually, we need more than this.	1.709932059831226
Fraud, mismanagement and nepotism do not come from nowhere.	0.843988377343118
They are most likely to occur if there is little democratic control on cash flow.	1.0071040403123726
Via the structural funds, a great deal of the European budget is being pumped around the system.	1.3815828211771082
This is only useful as long as there is a sense of solidarity where rich Member States contribute to both the revenue and development of poorer Member States.	1.2891708687851142
But there is also funding which is being pumped via Brussels back to the same rich Member States.	1.373830295290524
Districts and regional authorities consider this as their own money but they can only get their hands on this by investing vast amounts of money and manpower in lobbying and negotiating.	1.0807401881048244
After each incident of improper use of this money, and certainly after fraud, the call for stricter control is more pronounced.	1.224245800059923
Even the strictest control cannot solve this problem.	0.6583296424506963
It will, at best, lead to more bureaucracy and less room for local democracy and for people to get involved in choosing and developing projects.	1.0791015479736203
It would be preferable if national governments channelled this money directly to their local governments without a European detour.	1.0467206794257025
In the next couple of years, we will need to think about the possibility of replacing structural funds by an equalisation fund which is limited to budgetary aid for Member States or their constituent regions with a low income per capita of the population.	1.1183768302164172
This is probably the only way to achieve less fraud, less overheads, more transparency and more democracy.	1.2328708913026871
Mr President, a year has not yet passed, but it is already clear that Parliament is going to evaluate the first and second reports differently.	1.483743697942045
The first report was widely publicised, formally debated and used - just like the controversy and news leaks which preceded it - to make mincemeat, first of the President of the Commission, and then of the majority of the European Commissioners, even though they had no connection with fraud, mismanagement or nepotism.	1.5115319468316837
Reading now what happened then, not even a year ago, it becomes clear that that first report was intended to do anything but serve the cause of truth or reform, as is maintained today, so much so that this second report - which, on the other hand, could have provided much more salient points - was commissioned with the precise mandate not to address specific cases, since there is no intention to follow up the offences detailed in this report.	1.3905193442245651
It is of no concern to the major groups in Parliament, nor to the majority of the trade unions, who are busy discussing the defence of European public administration, but, in practice, are occupied with the corporate protection of their own members, putting the wide powers afforded to them to dubious use.	1.390212889439915
Trade union representatives sit on the Disciplinary Board and the Staff Regulations Committee, thereby making it impossible to remove disloyal officials and preserving the Staff Regulations in their fossilised state.	1.0919467567173418
Incomprehensibly, trade union representatives are also members of committees on competition, and I would not be surprised if union members were already members of OLAF, thereby placing this institution which should, at least formally, guarantee its impartiality, at great risk.	1.370742809759464
I therefore understand why we are meeting at this time, which is usually set aside for other activities and not for debates, discussions and the exchange of information.	1.3126393034171635
Mr President, when it comes to putting its own house in order, the European Commission is in a Catch-22 situation.	1.4752723137319985
There is enormous pressure of expectation following the events that led to the resignation of the previous Commission.	1.0148758754641876
I sometimes have the impression that the more radical the proposals made here in this Chamber sound, the more applause they receive.	1.365440795230448
There again, it is simply not possible to change situations once and for all with a few strokes of the pen, and the problems begin as soon as we have to start talking about implementation and getting down to brass tacks.	1.4625787589410335
This may explain why we experienced more difficulties than anticipated in the Committee on Budgetary Control as regards this issue.	1.0470120992693357
Nevertheless, the outcome is now on the table and there for all to see, and I would expressly like to thank Mr van Hulten for the work he has done on this report.	1.2797308210619185
Provided this report is not watered-down yet again by the adoption of amendments, it will afford us the opportunity to make clear and unambiguous demands of the Commission on a number of crucial points.	1.4316528669305288
Allow me to start with the most important demand.	1.1506137390582
We do not want financial control to be abolished.	1.1730933050340921
The financial controller should still be able to make checks before funding commitments or payments are made, not in every case, but wherever uncertainties or risks arise.	1.3111297528296302
The Commission is sending out the wrong signals here, by renaming the Directorate-General for Financial Control as the Directorate-General for Audits, for example.	1.2501802665515256
It may well be easy enough to change the Commission' s organisation chart but it is a different matter when it comes to the legal texts, particularly those relating to budgetary discipline.	1.3464019166278998
I do not have exact figures, but the Community' s budgetary discipline and the associated implementing provisions apply to almost 100 different areas of responsibility of the financial controller, to his or her independence and the tasks assigned to this office.	1.406605072402541
This cannot be ignored or evaded, certainly not on account of soft law, as was once suggested at a meeting of our Committee.	1.1812447931016312
Irrespective of such legal considerations, it would be an unforgivable mistake, under the circumstances, to scrap financial control in the traditional sense at the very moment when those responsible for such matters in the Commission are, at long last, no longer out on a limb but set to become part of a chain of functioning supervisory and investigatory mechanisms.	1.266945393694987
As we see it, there will be a dovetailing of three mechanisms in the future: a system of independent prior approval by the financial controller, concomitant and follow-up control by the internal audit service - also known as the audit service - which has yet to be set up, and finally, there will be the targeted tracking-down of irregularities by OLAF, the new anti-fraud office.	1.3426859606004369
It is to be welcomed that Mr van Hulten' s report makes the connection between all three areas and also makes it clear as to where the crucial shortcomings lie, which must be tackled.	1.283806993006823
A few salient points: the disciplinary procedures are not taking effect, especially when it comes to calling officials to account for their misdemeanours, including those of a financial nature.	1.2445616697798894
There is a large grey area and a great lack of clarity where criminal sanctions are concerned, and it is precisely in this area that the announcements made by the Commission are rather vague.	1.4400517410877978
I can only emphasise that these are the really hard nuts that finally need to be cracked.	1.2166346720130152
Mr President, firstly I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to my colleague, Mr van Hulten.	1.284926218702728
It is a good feeling to be able to say that he is from our delegation and I am, I think, entitled to feel a little proud of him.	1.399254011561546
I would in any case like to congratulate him on his report.	1.348739641858895
Mr President, the Commission' s resignation has also created a culture of fear amongst many officials within the hierarchy and large bureaucracy.	1.1060511278839507
The call to make a cultural U-turn and embrace a culture of responsibility seems to me a very fundamental one.	1.1489204766111798
I have witnessed from close up within the Development Committee how thousands of projects stagnate and how sometimes up to 80% of the money is not spent. Sometimes, an enormous reservoir of money is created, not because it is not desperately needed, not because there are no sound proposals, but because the whole system has collapsed.	1.4648486844102957
A lack of responsibility, too much ex ante, not enough ex post and, as a result, far too little in the way of a culture of real effective spending.	1.3466340995187038
It would be marvellous if this report were to give the green light to result-oriented spending of this kind, with all the work organised on that basis.	1.20702988599695
When the Commission' s first draft report soon becomes the official report on 1 March, I very much hope that our input here will help ensure that we will actually witness this change.	1.365785259876158
Without any doubt, this will then be a service, Mr President, to the European public and, by means of the results we produce, we will also regain and re-acquire something which we have ostensibly lost over the past couple of years.	1.5945732631123049
This is the best support we can give to European democracy.	1.411350997475563
If, in this way, we can move away from the culture of the fifties and cross over into the next century, we are witnessing a very special moment indeed.	1.3551294804952003
Mr President, first of all, congratulations to Michiel van Hulten for his first report.	0.9886812191642456
It was a baptism of fire but we have a saying in the Netherlands appropriate for this occasion: in at the deep end and you will swim in no time.	1.3189802138360975
Mr van Hulten, I think you deserve a medal for your efforts.	1.3172781985623792
There are two points which, in my opinion, deserve special attention on the part of the ELDR.	1.0353760818337505
Firstly, there is the Commissioners' individual responsibility.	1.2706973091007745
This must be regulated during the IGC.	0.960356265925287
However, we should not like this important issue to end up entirely in the hands of the Council and we have, therefore, submitted an amendment in which we ask whether an interinstitutional agreement could be reached between the Commission and Parliament in order to ensure that we have a kind of fall-back position and are not placing our fate completely in the hands of the Council.	1.4102056571242898
Secondly, as already mentioned by my colleague, Mr Mulder, the ELDR is of the opinion that the European Parliament should also be investigated by independent experts.	1.5495284561377543
This will contribute hugely towards re-establishing the confidence of the European citizens in this institution.	1.2033171063250545
We at the European Parliament cannot be a credible counterpart to this reformed Commission as long as we do not search our hearts and put our own House in order as well.	1.1549205936908968
Only when all European institutions are reformed will we have the open, democratic and decisive Europe which our citizens now finally deserve.	1.1918733652741915
Mr President, I also wish to congratulate Mr van Hulten on this first piece of work which he is presenting to the House.	1.3065368402674689
I am sure that it will serve, amongst other things, to make his second report more flexible and for him to step up efforts to find a consensus amongst the groups.	1.235373000949715
At this stage, there can be no delay in the process of reforming the Commission, demanded by our citizens.	1.1052237431395457
This Parliament has often heard the desire to reform the Commission expressed, even by its Presidents.	1.2744468733301202
It now appears that this desire is more serious.	0.8600732774075398
After the resignation of a Commission and after a Committee of Experts has listed an almost endless number of deficiencies, it makes sense that Mr Prodi should have promised, on 14 September, to present this Parliament with a complete plan for reform by February.	1.3738450908864202
This Parliament anxiously awaits this complete reform programme.	0.5726922249193235
The report that we are debating today intends to give political force to many of the recommendations of the Committee of Experts commissioned by this Parliament.	1.2640057945925152
Mr Prodi said he would act anyway, that he preferred to get things right, but that fear of not getting things right would not prevent him from acting.	1.3206698283025524
We therefore ask that his programme be a bold one and, if it is, I can assure him that he will have the support of this House in the reform process.	1.5450981073027168
We want a strong Commission, which can act in an independent and neutral manner, but with political sense.	1.5711111463240157
Commissioners should not be considered senior officials but rather politicians in office.	0.8976594047559645
Therefore, the report allows them to be members of political parties and to be members of political bodies affiliated to their parties.	1.382424755477701
Perhaps the reference to the posts is imprecise.	0.7234804724156008
I do not know your exact view in this respect, Mr Kinnock, but it is clear that we want Commissioners who are politically strong and politically committed.	1.342998131957943
We want a structure which allows every Euro to be spent effectively, and our accounts demonstrate that this is not happening at present.	1.4363431442684484
Therefore, Commissioner, we ask Mr Prodi to present us with a bold programme, and he will find that he has problems with those bodies who feel that their status quo is under threat, but not with this Parliament, which expects profound and daring changes.	1.4883909306943266
Mr President, the Santer Commission came to grief because financial control failed all down the line.	0.951069405060441
Therefore, the future of this new Commission will depend in no small measure on the extent to which reforms are swiftly undertaken here and financial control is back in working order.	1.3038906696994343
As far as this is concerned, a number of people have already referred to the fact that the Commission intends to drastically improve and consolidate its follow-up checks and that these checks should be carried out on a completely independent basis, with no sweeping of matters under the carpet in future.	1.2682713987662382
Naturally, this is only to be welcomed.	1.7555689676153172
What I do not understand is why this has to come at a price, as it were, that is, of having to dispense with independent - and I stress, independent - prior approval.	1.4714667536679906
Up until now, the Commission' s payments could only be made when the authorising officer signed the appropriate order and the financial controller gave his approval in the form of a visa.	1.1682772977548301
And so it is the "two key" principle that applies here.	1.1982739345330409
A single key is to suffice in future.	0.6918476637542263
The financial controller is no longer to make advance checks, if all goes to plan as regards the reforms currently under discussion within the Commission.	1.274791886115939
If you will pardon me for saying so, Mr Kinnock, what you are proposing is a little like abolishing the police because they were unable to prevent crimes.	1.3992261824655472
What we really need to focus on, however, is making the checks more effective.	1.1839839219164248
This could be achieved by no longer insisting, in future, that the financial controllers furnish every single payment transaction with their approval stamp.	1.3233236180021983
It is precisely those who feel the need to control everything that end up controlling nothing at all.	1.1476479253221892
Therefore, in future, prior approval should take place in a targeted manner, that is, only in cases of uncertainty or risk.	1.4200181854445733
The officials responsible for financial control should be deployed on a decentralised basis, that is, in the operational Directorates-General, amongst those of their colleagues that spend the money, so that they are immediately available when problems arise and so as to render the checks less ponderous and time-consuming.	1.1585276138781793
However, the financial controllers must work independently.	1.4871934472008248
That is the crucial difference between our plans and those of the Commission, when it talks in terms of decentralisation.	1.4030574439107775
It is obviously the Commission' s intention to make the financial control officials subordinate to the individual Directorates-General, but this is precisely what we do not want.	1.4881397093304245
Surely we have learnt this much from the events surrounding the Leonardo affair, when the internal examiners in the relevant Directorate-General issued warnings, but these were neither heeded nor passed on.	1.2331766721159936
Therefore, independence is prerequisite for effective checks.	1.0164171844525032
That is the position which a clear majority of the Committee on Budgetary Control subscribes to.	1.3910968172136335
Indeed, the new Commission has now declared itself in favour of follow-up checks having this independence, and so would it not make sense for a system of prior approval to enjoy such independence as well?	1.39693512041536
I believe we should set the seal on this point at tomorrow' s vote.	1.212710442757346
Mrs Theato has already expressed as much and I am only too willing to support her in this regard.	1.195356425739234
Mr President, a couple of years ago, the previous Commission tried once and for all to tackle rigid and obsolescent structures.	1.4929841194112754
This led to strikes and smear campaigns by intransigent trade unions, whereupon the proposals were abandoned and replaced by a wishy-washy compromise.	0.8501852489767375
This was stupid of the old Commission, and Parliament was of no help on that occasion.	1.3504109208218207
When I read Mr van Hulten' s passage about personnel policy, I am afraid that Parliament may again be failing to tackle the crucial issues and just spouting a lot of hot air.	1.150514196467347
There are too many rights, too many regulations and too little room for leadership.	1.1793168650358674
There is no backbone, and no teeth.	1.612354260940334
Where is the beef?	0.3112466502145991
And I would also say this to you, Commissioner: please, deliver the beef even if it is British.	1.3854626681463642
Romano Prodi promised a revolution.	0.3973091543102199
You have said some powerful and worthwhile things yourself, but take care now that you do not dodge the crucial issues, the ones where it hurts!	1.3134045753346733
Sort out the tangle of staff allowances.	0.6659936975208048
Stand firm on the demand for mobility, not as a right, as it says here in the report, but as a management tool.	1.4884036924538218
Ensure too, that training becomes a management tool.	1.145571200329244
Do not listen to the report' s demands that temporary staff should have their employment confirmed.	1.1618598741982684
It is the posts which should possibly be made permanent and not necessarily those employed on a temporary basis.	1.0810406553455387
Finally, Mr President, as a member of the Bureau until six months ago, I would urge you to address this issue in the Bureau so that we here in Parliament at least comply, in our own administration, with the demands we are making on others.	1.5718152885089223
We have not done this so far, and this is something you ought to be instrumental in changing.	1.3164510994978063
Mr President, I want to thank Mr van Hulten for his report and to say that I voted for it.	1.4026303449876891
So I refer to the things I do not agree with.	1.0267604363931089
I do not agree with the paragraphs in relation to Parliament.	1.007136158521689
This report is about the Commission.	1.272593722008809
Parliament is a separate subject.	0.9483656276126137
There is no need for us to bring Parliament into the discussion on the Commission.	1.1635898394587227
In addition to that, there is the question of duty-free.	1.1433049701539553
That was a stick used to beat the Commission by the duty-free lobbies who resented the fact that the Commission abolished duty-free in airports.	1.0928767866993245
It is not worthy of being brought into this report either.	1.2410363847235375
Most of the report is about financial control.	1.4102012423504022
That is reasonable because it comes from the Budgetary Control Committee.	0.8908411638746362
But we should not create the impression that vast amounts of European resources are being put at risk by carelessness in the European Commission.	1.2492568848112449
After all, it is only 1% of GDP, by comparison with national spending.	1.3953488859879912
We have had all that before but some people in this Parliament are young and do not seem to understand how small the financial resources of the European Union are and that 80% of these resources are spent by the Member States.	1.2960362340871971
So carelessness within the Commission in the spending of money is not likely to put at risk vast quantities of money.	1.1490847603874497
We should get it into perspective.	0.7987942989682317
It is important to remember that.	0.8326801270093604
The business of the European Commission is very little about spending money.	1.529632357965722
They have very little of it.	0.6765157064161305
They have a much wider responsibility.	0.9819852200127129
That wider responsibility concerns the management of the environment, food safety, foreign trade, the internal market and so many other responsibilities we have given them without the resources to deal with them.	1.181005266033722
I am not one of the people who agrees that there is a vast lack of trust.	1.3317153311855252
If there is, we have generated it in this House in the past year.	1.7098138591899754
I have been here for 20 years and found absolute trust between the Council, the Commission and Parliament.	1.3483137567668828
We have had our problems and we recognised difficulties but there was not a situation where this bureaucratic Commission was mistrusted, doubted and feared by the citizens of the European Union because they were mismanaging our affairs.	1.2902709816553304
That is a gross exaggeration of what the difficulties were.	1.127651155612894
This Commission should not have to live forever in the shadow of the mistakes that caused the resignation of the Commission that went before it.	1.3224805163778055
While there were problems - and we have to resolve them in view of enlargement, for instance - we sometimes take the negative side too far.	1.5541426155292293
Mr President, I should very much like to thank the rapporteur for his splendid report.	1.250565053946107
I hope that the Commission will use it in its reform work.	1.3624008824578033
The process of reform has been going on for some time, and something like a state of emergency seems to prevail in the Commission.	1.313013166583305
The Commission' s administration simply does not function particularly well.	0.9985034327558774
Naturally, there are good, capable employees in the Commission, and they are in the majority. But we need radical reform.	1.6473255923114685
There is too little action and too much unnecessary bureaucracy.	1.0181918285042162
People should have clearly-defined powers to take decisions for which they should also be accountable.	1.1405787226506632
The Financial Regulation should be amended.	0.9993090807529769
We agree that we should have better control of the finances.	1.2627081360079362
It is just a question of how.	1.2921184323395496
The Commission and the Committee of Independent Experts are in favour of completely doing away with ex ante financial control.	1.1653132170096334
We should be careful about this.	0.9893646382213156
We should retain some form of ex ante financial control.	0.5389191682091036
It is not enough simply to carry out spot checks once the money has been spent.	1.1277919852575369
This would allow too many anomalous projects to slip through.	0.8638108079807068
Instead, we should be reforming and decentralising control.	1.2203012985619421
The Commission does not have enough staff.	1.0318762425194357
As Members of the European Parliament, we must have the courage to explain to our governments and people back home that the Commission' s staff resources are not at all adequate for the tasks which have been assigned to it.	1.3618466732310066
And the Commission should be able to refuse new tasks if it does not also get the extra staff it needs.	1.1516278307087362
The staffing system is too rigid.	0.6772345743833521
There should be a more frequent rotation of employees, especially at the top of the hierarchy.	1.0989768415686358
It should also be much easier to sack inefficient and incompetent employees.	0.7714293948020495
I am therefore very pleased that the disciplinary procedure is to be reformed.	1.1936482583483983
After all, the very bad experiences so far with disciplinary proceedings show all too clearly how necessary it is that we carry out reforms.	1.2384827205201332
Mr President, Commissioners, first of all, I cannot help but reflect upon the fact that this is, on the whole, a Dutch-British-Scandinavian debate where the speakers are concerned.	1.3366221600645867
Perhaps this is a little worrying.	1.4349343051946597
I hope, like so many others, that the state of emergency in relations between the Commission and Parliament is on the way to being resolved.	1.4039617029315705
We must get away from the idea that we are rushing to put out a fire in one corner, only then to have to rush again to put out the next one. As Mr Blak said, we must instead establish a system with clear roles.	1.4352007909948068
First of all, we need tough regulations, which can be implemented.	1.4415629705536548
Codes of conduct and ethical committees are not enough.	0.5945587922765646
There need to be tough rules stating, among other things, what may be decentralised, what may be outsourced and what is independent.	1.119602728137478
I find it a little worrying that people are clamouring for independence in this debate without defining what it is in relation to which there is to be independence and without defining what right of decision-making is to be exercised.	1.2711797844794883
What we need, then, are basic administrative regulations for the EU, for its institutions and for the EU in its relations with the Member States.	1.5435440627988568
These are what are missing.	0.7676733650964772
We have asked for a Public Prosecutor' s Office and criminal law, but we also need administrative law for the EU.	1.3085657768276873
We should make a good deal of progress if the Commission were to adopt, as binding regulations, the ombudsman' s proposal of a code of conduct for good administrative practice.	1.4356146802287297
The van Hulten report is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough.	0.9294061074345523
Secondly, we must also clarify our own auditing roles.	1.3118126642219052
The Court of Auditors is to monitor the extent to which actions are incompatible with the regulations, but it should not examine the expediency of a particular action.	1.1998597081017361
It is the European Parliament which is to carry out the political evaluation.	1.8607600890874127
We do not hunt down criminals. That is OLAF' s job.	1.2394100473580643
Tell me what national parliament, for example, is handed all preliminary investigation documents.	1.1363268064119438
Obstinate as I am, I also want to say that the regulations governing public access to official records must be clearly better than the draft which has been circulating on the Internet. Otherwise, we shall not get anywhere in this fight.	1.3364733896000753
Mr President, I would like to extend a warm thank you to the rapporteur for his report.	1.3177709717449315
I am pleased that I can address him now in Dutch, now that Mr Van den Berg has just done so. Otherwise I probably would have felt slightly guilty about this.	1.2297109312394572
I would like to say that this report represents a huge improvement, also with its amendments.	1.3509527733750084
I am from the Social Committee and rapporteurs on our committee are always proud to receive 100 amendments because then they know that they have tabled an interesting topic.	1.1561710423652236
I think that this is also the case here, but I think it would be a bit over the top to spend too much time talking about these 100 amendments.	1.4193625659810987
I would also point out that our coordinator on the Budgetary Control Committee is Mr Pomés Ruiz, who is Spanish and has hence made a major contribution to this debate from a Spanish perspective.	1.3455676870005395
Mr President, one of the key aspects which have been mentioned is, to my mind, the rapporteur' s proposal for the standing committee on standards in public administration.	1.579569679912194
A very important proposal indeed.	0.9196904092993239
I am only very surprised that the Socialist group would like to subordinate this proposal to one tabled by Mrs Morgan, because she wants to scrap it altogether.	1.3525051102650432
I cannot fully grasp the underlying rationale.	0.667971818474862
On the one hand, we receive all kinds of words of praise for the rapporteur but, at the same time, Mrs Morgan wants to pursue a sort of scorched earth policy on this point and on other key points as well, as a result of which, in fact, the entire content of this report vanishes.	1.3397440970786716
I do not know whether this is to appease Mr Kinnock, but I happen to know Mr Kinnock.	1.3167790018224008
He is happy to hear what our demands are and is quite prepared to be flexible if he considers it necessary.	1.021515759911676
In my opinion, such a far-reaching scorched earth policy is really unnecessary.	0.9982371882449177
Finally, the issue of officials.	1.2323225948890684
Actually, I do not entirely share Mr Haarder' s view.	1.2172137267547571
I do agree that the section on officials has, in fact, been completed totally inadequately.	1.2068165215331021
First of all, the importance of a public service in general is not at all emphasised. Secondly, all kinds of proposals are nevertheless being mooted, and we have to ask ourselves whether these are terribly appropriate and whether they would lead to improvement.	1.3743521138085781
For example, we are currently looking into TAOs. This is a key point but, at the same time, we want to abolish temporary staff at the Commission.	1.4000016181601216
These two considerations are diametrically opposed to each other, and I really fail to grasp how such a proposal can end up on the table.	1.2073824430456697
Mr President, ever since Plato' s 'Republic' , the Western world has regularly been tempted to replace government by the people with government by experts.	1.2626438667137903
Our Parliament first asked experts to help it evaluate the performance of the European Commission and they took advantage of this invitation to determine, themselves, what its future should be.	1.2459061161246863
In this second report, the experts have gone a step further and criticised some of the political groups in Parliament, which may have hesitated to remove the European Commission from office, since they shared the political affiliations of some of its members.	1.4261670939466073
The experts think that this problem will be resolved by banning the Commissioners from belonging to political groups.	1.0899737927641036
According to the experts, Parliament should no longer have the power to supervise the European Commission. This task should be taken over by a committee which will guarantee high standards in public life, and this should be a standing committee, not elected, presumably made up of another group of experts.	1.4347747567586049
In this, their second report, the experts tell us that Italy is financed by the Cohesion Fund, that the ERDF and the Social Fund represent two-thirds of the Structural Funds and that the principles of additionality and complementarity in the Structural Funds come to the same thing. They tell us that the farming lobby is forcing us to finance rural development through the EAGGF-Guarantee and that the principle of partnership only applies to the Commission and to the Member States.	1.3836531787342512
This lesson in wisdom is 100% ideology and 0% knowledge.	0.7161646936198587
This will not help us to reform the European institutions whilst fully respecting democratic institutions.	1.3054048823223636
The van Hulten report started out as a brilliant one and I would like to pay deep and sincere tribute here to what Mr van Hulten achieved.	1.1018227853342553
Unfortunately, it was then changed, and changed for the worse, which turned it into a document which in fact, proposes something that we cannot accept.	1.6595699836821132
Mr President, Mr van Hulten, your work is worthy of being qualified as enterprising, arduous and complex, and I believe this is important in a first report.	1.3421440271152205
Please therefore accept what I am about to say as being criticism made in the spirit of honest debate, and I believe that in this way our debate here today will be richer.	1.342359566676179
This report seems to me to be redundant, long-winded, confused and lacking in accuracy in the terms used.	0.9831113696970594
Perhaps 'redundant' is the most serious epithet, and you are not responsible for this. It is the responsibility of this Parliament.	1.5860132322105198
That is to say, if this Parliament commissions a Committee of Experts - and I am not going to repeat what Mr Casaca has said, but I agree with him to a large extent - to analyse a problem, where is the sense in indulging in the medieval tradition of criticising the critics and so on, ad infinitum.	1.3614767852689613
Clearly we are awaiting this reform from the Commission, we are awaiting the proposals which the Commission is going to make to us and this Parliament will have to express its opinion on them.	1.5602087162386191
Meanwhile, we have to offer the Commission a vote of confidence.	1.5980505304056467
'Long-winded' .	0.521843129166721
I am not going to mention the length of this report.	0.9899971237736747
I do not know if it breaks the record for all the resolutions presented here, but, for this type of resolution it certainly does.	1.4400803856405475
I do not believe that there has ever been a resolution - and in this Parliament we certainly produce complex resolutions - which has had paragraphs of more than 16 lines without a single full stop.	1.4772294333953344
It is also 'confusing' .	1.0872834010802357
I am not going to return to what has been said about the analysis of questions concerning Parliament.	1.0355377507851353
That should be the subject of another report and we will have to carry one out and consider that issue, but not in this report.	1.4161930578069175
And finally, Mr President, frankly, I am not going to give examples, but there are many cases in which legal language is used with an alarming lack of accuracy.	1.3688395907006286
Therefore - in summary - I await, and many of us await, your report, Commissioner Kinnock, so that we can really express our opinion on it, which is the duty of this Parliament.	1.61843307077428
Mr President, the scope and highly detailed nature of the proposals for necessary reform measures show just how important these reforms are.	1.22034428786582
When one considers the events that have set these endeavours in motion though, it is only too clear as to why there is a need for them.	1.2050836445364619
Hopes and expectations were raised higher still by the strong messages sent out by Commissioners Prodi and Kinnock in plenary and in the Committee on Budgetary Control.	0.925063157682216
The concept of transparency stands out in the report.	0.7956759388744412
Securing this is a major priority.	1.3554230566729133
The importance of smooth-running, comprehensible work cannot possibly be emphasised enough.	0.8086513209947379
This is not just about bureaucratic reform, however; rather, it is about showing good will towards the citizens.	1.4591168573578859
We must win back their faith in EU politics.	0.6941902121050809
The citizens demand rapid and open access to the institutions and call for EU provisions to be comprehensible to them.	1.0824598243142742
This is what enables them to understand what is going on.	1.137750969849171
They want to see the politics of success and believe that this is how any politically mature citizen could expect to be served	1.178673469785622
Whether or not the reforms succeed depends, to a very large extent, on the Commission' s own initiative.	1.3841602796815395
However, it annoyed me when I heard today that the Commission is now saying that it only wishes to discuss the interim report with Parliament on an informal basis.	1.4188560646140949
However, Mr Kinnock, your presentation to the Committee on Budgetary Control this coming Tuesday must not just be a one-way street; rather, as Parliamentarians, we want, and must, play a part in this and it also goes against my understanding of politics when I find that yet another press conference has taken place this week, before we have had chance to carefully discuss the submission in the competent Committee on Budgetary Control.	1.444707695088997
I believe, Mr Kinnock, that notwithstanding all the success achieved on a personal level, the Commission still has quite a lot to do to satisfy our justifiably high expectations.	1.4440629134353227
Can I begin by stating for the record and for the enlightenment of Mrs Langenhagen that the decision for me not to address the full plenary tomorrow and therefore be available for formal responses on the report is not mine and not the Commission's - it was the decision of this Parliament!	1.485333132812168
So if she has any lectures to offer they are best contained within this House.	0.8423459307143659
She knows me well enough to understand that at all stages in the five years in which we worked together in this House, there has never been a single occasion on which I have refused to account in full, formally and in detail for everything I have done.	1.2971956302540981
Mr President, may I begin by paying tribute to the painstaking and, from what I hear, the pains-accepting work of Mr van Hulten in preparing his report.	1.303901689302134
Although new to this House he is relatively old in some respects, certainly in his familiarity with the Institutions as a former official - and I think that the value of that is shown by his ability to tackle the complex subject which is of critical importance, as several Members have said, to all of our Institutions.	1.3541363991865054
I thank him and I wish him a long and distinguished career as a representative.	1.1445617748779184
Mr President, as you will know, Mr van Hulten's report on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts is necessarily long and, since I want to make a comprehensive reply, particularly on the issues relating to financial management and control, I seek your indulgence.	1.5054441794617592
Naturally I will not take up any more of the time of the House than is absolutely necessary.	1.4411425409864056
When this House considered the second report of the Committee of Experts last September, I pledged on behalf of the incoming Commission that the report would be treated as a fundamental ingredient in the Commission's reform proposals.	1.4912456807479744
Our efforts to completely honour that pledge will be evident to the House when consideration is given to the reform package that was adopted by the Commission today, well within the demanding timetable that we set for ourselves four months ago.	1.181800453788648
I am sure that Mr Pomes Ruiz is encouraged by that.	0.9748546853973341
The great majority of the paper's proposals are closely akin to those put by Mr van Hulten and that paper includes - I say to him and to Mr Staes - a very explicit timetable of actions to be undertaken in pursuit of reform.	1.311618014842634
There is nothing therefore that is open-ended or vague about the report which I have had the honour to compile.	1.231656463090191
The considered view of this Parliament in the consultation period over the next four to five weeks will for obvious reasons be of great significance.	1.236514057771385
I would say to Mr Elles that we are most definitely in listening mode.	1.2168349470965583
But he will appreciate - with his customary generosity I am sure - that for us to be able to listen to the response to what we are proposing, it is first necessary to transmit what we are proposing.	1.5349112946147276
Hence the transmission.	0.3297873845324176
Though time forbids me, Mr President, from commenting in this debate on each element in the resolution before the House, I readily give the assurance that the details will be treated as an important input into our reform proposals throughout this consultation and indeed to our work in other relevant areas.	1.4193144878392687
Turning to the main themes of the resolution I offer the following observations.	1.206049268583884
The need for transparency is rightly stressed, not least because greater transparency in the way in which the Commission operates will improve the efficiency and will also demystify what the Commission does.	1.3835766202427777
This is essential for an executive administration that must be accountable, not just to this House, but more generally to the European public.	1.4592284759083065
Naturally, sensible safeguards are required to protect specially sensitive information, but the cases where these are needed should be kept to the minimum possible.	1.2942917711796247
I have repeatedly emphasised that, indeed not just as a Commissioner, but in 25 or 30 years of campaigning.	1.4693112060091584
That most certainly is the intention of the Commission.	1.1122952828804098
Financial management and control is obviously a crucial area of reform.	0.9343985441695608
As the House knows and has repeatedly said, the scale and scope of the Union's financial interventions have grown immensely in the past decade without a proportionate increase in staffing or an adjustment in procedures.	1.2140725588502561
Several Members have made that point again in the course of today's debate.	1.0587236622741794
We share the view, forcefully expressed by the Committee of Independent Experts, and repeated in this draft resolution that the time has come for a thorough overhaul of our rules and procedures.	1.3792904122698015
The means of doing that are set out in the reform strategy and the Commission will present its proposals for a radical recasting of the Financial Regulation in April.	1.4010013384003508
Parliamentary support in pursuing that essential course for change will be absolutely vital.	0.8052953771456454
I share the view expressed by Mrs Theato that it would not be acceptable in any way at all for us to seek to operate new arrangements without a change in the law.	1.2464914090150816
Change in the law is fundamental.	0.8266120755209456
There are preparations which can be made and they are specified and set out with the full reassurances in the reform strategy, but enactment of change in the legislation is obviously of fundamental importance to the operation of the new system.	1.3051827959054667
Essentially - and with legal change - the Commission will systematically move away from the current centralised system of prior approval of each financial transaction by the Financial Controller and instead strengthen the internal control systems within spending departments so that Directors-General are better equipped to take responsibility for decisions with an impact on the European Union budget.	1.3873786501444927
In addition, and to achieve better assurances than those provided under the present system, the new system of decentralised controls must be complemented by setting up an internal audit service - "the second key" as Herr Bösch said, established in a way that is closely consistent with the recommendations of the Committee of Experts.	1.5184444893367874
That service will open on 1 May this year.	0.7929751520921893
It will be headed by a professionally qualified member of the audit profession and its independence must and will be guaranteed through a new provision to be added in the financial regulation.	1.2118041723639095
The new service will report to me and it will be accompanied by an Audit Progress Board chaired by my colleague, Mrs Schreyer, who I am delighted to see in the Chamber this evening.	1.174746096640581
As Budgets Commissioner, here responsibilities already include relations with the Court of Auditors.	1.2865257695360417
This Audit Progress Board will ensure effective and rigorous follow-up to internal audits.	1.0249715885602941
I want to emphasise strongly that changing our control systems will definitely not mean relaxing them.	1.0486047036954436
The proposed change will make the systems more effective, both in terms of inputs and in terms of measured and accountable outcomes.	0.9500383107728304
I can also specifically assure the House that we are not going for what is sometimes called "a big bang approach".	1.318751300843547
Financial control' s ex ante visa for each spending department will only be relinquished as and when the internal control system in a department is shown to be fully adequate.	1.0610011545167
I am somewhat surprised that paragraph 10 of the draft resolution does not appear to address the fundamental criticisms of the current centralised financial control function made in both reports of the Committee of Independent Experts.	1.1358951823982528
That committee was very clear about the need to abolish the centralised ex ante visa.	0.9565074407104714
It was clear too on the need to separate internal audit from financial control.	0.910099261228419
In addition, I do not believe that paragraph 10 fully reflects the opinion of the Court of Auditors in 1997.	1.204154001569672
Naturally the Court will be able to give its considered opinion on the proposed changes to the Financial Regulation but it is useful to recall Mr Karlsson' s comments to this House last month. "The Commission's internal control" he said "is not forceful enough in preventing incorrect operation.	1.4195282600244359
For instance, the Financial Controller granted a positive a priori visa in most of the cases of mismanagement or irregularities recently uncovered.	1.1825321671299698
At the same time, the internal audit function is carried out in an uncoordinated way by several bodies, notably the same Financial Controller, the Inspectorate General and by some units operating Directorates-General."	1.2327999313965008
The centralised ex ante approval system was doubtlessly originally designed to ensure carefulness but, over the years, it has had the perverse effect of reducing the extent to which managers feel responsible for their decisions.	1.1064934278544443
I do not believe that there is any real disagreement between us on this.	1.0666999427660024
I take it from paragraph 10 that the underlying preoccupation of honourable Members is that there should be a carefully managed transition.	1.0075062539208535
That will most certainly be the character of the change as honourable Members will see when they read the reform strategy document.	1.0558440853580295
Our objective, the committee' s objective, the Court of Auditors' objective is not to abolish financial control, it is to get rid of and improve upon centralised financial control.	1.5080947782335372
Before leaving this area I would add that we agree with the rapporteur that the existing internal audit function must be maintained pending the establishment of the new independent internal audit service in a matter of months.	1.3271125593172863
Turning quickly to the section of the resolution on fighting fraud, corruption, mismanagement and nepotism: the major new proposal of the report concerns reporting by Commission officials of perceived wrong-doing.	1.145888522681835
As I made clear in the hearings last September and on other occasions, we are at one in the belief that there is value in defining the best possible mechanisms for this purpose although obviously we all hope that it will rarely be needed.	1.2743668801035153
Since June of last year, the OLAF regulation has given better guidance to staff about reporting possible irregularities.	0.9232923362234748
We propose to complement those provisions by defining the rights and obligations for officials to report suspected wrong-doing through internal channels but not exclusively within the same hierarchical line.	0.9801451953012289
The possibility of using specified external channels will also be addressed.	0.8804587698554659
We are seeking to implement best practice.	0.7621328602750804
Serious response to reports, confidentiality at early stages and career protection will be assured for people who report wrong-doing in good faith and in ways that do not compromise investigations by untimely disclosure.	0.8922865244491817
As a corollary, there will be safeguards for officials who are the subject of false allegations.	1.0984098362453074
A communication later this year will give full details.	0.750554227246416
I do not think Parliament will be disappointed by what we will propose.	1.386553465643594
I am persuaded, however, by the suggestion in paragraph 34 of the report on using external bodies to enforce existing provisions on financial liability.	1.2330544279355322
We already plan to reform the existing disciplinary procedures to ensure thoroughness, fairness, consistency and professionalism.	0.9956472452054996
And we will propose the establishment of an interinstitutional Disciplinary Board - something else on which we will need the support and understanding of Parliament.	1.4762693152073354
A communication in June will set out the full proposal for change.	0.9995289134746185
Standards in public life is the next main section of the report before the House.	1.201477239274661
With the introduction of a series of codes of conduct the current Commission has begun to develop an explicit ethical framework.	1.025596693740657
This will be taken a step further with a proposal in June for an interinstitutional agreement on a committee on standards in public life.	1.2512505944617176
That is in line with the draft resolution.	0.9353897825436032
An important role for the committee will be to give advice on ethics and standards and to supervise common and separate codes of conduct for the institutions.	1.2192025284578654
I welcome Parliament's support for that.	0.699372170487434
We are also currently examining how we can most effectively implement the proposal for a classification system for documents, made in paragraph 50 of Mr van Hulten's report.	1.1278989639971717
The draft resolution rightly recalls the Commission's accountability to this Parliament.	1.1344861328015587
President Prodi and Vice-President de Palacio and other colleagues have demonstrated the Commission's practical commitment to that.	1.1425947240198369
I hope that we will soon be able to agree a code of conduct on relations between our institutions which will include updated rules on access to documents.	1.216713997091391
The point was very properly raised by Mr Elles and referred to by Mrs Thors.	0.9605362735340561
I am sure they are aware that in mid-December we officially received the draft framework agreement with Parliament.	1.225330821843976
We are now waiting for Parliament to decide when it wishes to begin negotiations on the text.	1.016743064857345
We are very happy to proceed as rapidly as possible.	0.9819151431885955
The report rightly emphasises the central importance that human resources policy must have in reform.	0.9456580484046342
I am glad to say to Mr van Hulten and Mr Haarder that the detailed recommendations on recruitment, training, appraisal and the appointment to management positions are very much in line with our own thinking and our own proposals.	1.2708463725925034
I also want to move towards a linear career system because the current category system is no longer adapted to the needs of our institutions.	0.9698507234216969
It certainly blocks the advance and mobility of people with proven capabilities.	0.7942345705426702
Members, who, in the course of this debate, have properly praised Commission officials, who in the great majority and typically are of high integrity, hard-working and of great capability, are absolutely right in the comments that they have made.	1.4096954490769742
While the reform strategy White Paper will clearly outline our ideas on these and other points, detail and precision are obviously essential.	0.9819036766557033
A series of communications will therefore follow in the coming months.	0.7285796691073035
Each of them will be available for reflection and response by this House.	1.0379529575307296
It is, meanwhile, very obvious that we will need to work closely with Parliament, as an institution, on central matters of common interest, notably pay and pensions and the revision of the staff regulations.	1.4181557274756802
On this latter point we are reflecting on whether it might be useful to adopt a framework regulation which makes common provision on leading issues like pay, conditions, staff representation rights and so on, but enables the different institutions to operate implementing rules on other matters.	1.0954053696161323
The early thoughts of Parliament on this consultative idea would be especially welcome.	0.9163426268037842
I conclude by referring to paragraph 15 of the resolution before the House relating to the resource requirements of our policies for change.	1.0279557169933964
That is most certainly relevant.	0.6635338824244502
We are sure that there will be an important "reform dividend" as the modernisation measures begin to foster increased efficiency and better management in the use of resources.	1.22731099125331
It is very clear, however, that parts of the Commission services are already very stretched.	1.5227085069181308
Parliament has frequently made that point.	0.5780449437011017
Secondly, it is also clear that reform will require some new investment in training for skills and in technology.	1.2391194574292572
Thirdly, it is very clear that increased preparations for enlargement must be undertaken.	1.368268862633752
